Oh I know dropped the ban hammer somewhere around here...
If only... this hammer... WASN'T SO HE...AVY! Ooof!
Dwarven vow number 7 - Goodness and love will always win.
*Trips over hammer* U-ugu...
*swings the hammer, but it slips out of her hands!*
*swings the hammer, but is pulled down by it's weight!*
