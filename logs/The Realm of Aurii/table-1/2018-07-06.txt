Afina (Georgia🍀): [afina back to table 1?]
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina walked briskly down the hallway towards the Cardinal’s office._This could be a momentous mistake,_ she thought, hands clenched at her sides. _If Enera really was kidnapped, then that’s the first shot fired between Eraia and Callora in years. And puts me, not only on enemy lines, but directly involved in the situation._ Afina bit her lip nervously as the door to the Cardinal’s office approached. _But if a Calloran citizen was, in fact, kidnapped… then it’s also my duty to return her safely to her family_, Afina thought, shaking her head as she tucked her hair behind her ear. Even if Enera wasn’t a citizen of Laera, she was a citizen of the Calloran alliance as a whole, meaning Afina still had a duty to protect her. The kingdom of Callora only worked because individual nations looked out for each other. 

“Not to mention, this is for one of Eliran’s friends,” Afina mumbled, hesitating in front of the Cardinal’s door. _Honestly, after all this time, one would think I’ve given up on impressing Eliran,_ she thought with a small smile. Afina straightened her back, lifting her chin up, and knocked on the door to the Cardinal’s office. A reply from inside let Afina know that she may enter, and she pushed the door open.
Afina (Georgia🍀): “Hello Cardinal Raive, I hope I am not intruding,” the Laeran said, stepping into his study. “You have offered nothing but your utmost hospitality to me, yesterday, and for that I would like to thank you. But I also was wondering if you might be able to assist me with something. You see, Bishop Dean indicated that there was another Calloran light mage practicing here. I was curious as to whether or not I might be able to meet him or her. Callorans seem to practice a different orientation of light magic than Eraians or Theanovians do. I was hoping to compare strategies.” The princess spoke formally, curtly, with her hands clasped behind her back. She had set the wheels in motion for a potentially risky move, without much promise of a reward. But it felt like the proper thing to do, for her kingdom, and for Eliran.
