Bill: ```Splitting from Head-table```
Bill: A letter is slid under Afina's door in the monastery, earlier than she would have expected yet not so early she wasn't awake to see it.

```
Milady Afina Tyndall,

I have set aside a training hall for the two of us this morning where you can show me your ability. I will build a lesson plan of sorts from our session in the afternoon, while you may attend any of the lectures occuring here at the monastery, or do self study in the library. In the pre supper hour I shall share my plan with you, and if you find it agreeable we may begin on it in the morn. I shall see you in 104 after you have dined for the morning. Feel no need to rush. 

Blessed are those words which carry my thoughts to you, may they express only the light and truth.
Head Bishop Torin Dean

"Welcome Princess." Torin says, not bowing despite use of the royal term. "The Cardinal tells me you are the eager type, and I'll admit that is the best kind of student in my opinion. My objective is simple, I'd like you to walk me through your spell craft, from simple to complex to unique. Show me what you understand enough to cast, what you have challenges with, and your favorites. Give me an insight into your connection with Lylalel's magic, so I may know who you are through your understanding." 

Torin gives you reign of the room, stepping aside with quill and ink.
