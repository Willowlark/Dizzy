Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina was growing restless. _I have to make my way to the door,_ she thought, glancing between the clock and Bishop Torin, who had turned his back on her to grab another book from the shelf. Afina looked down at the cover of the tomes she had already worn through, which now was nothing more than a piece of leather, sewn together with remnants of paper. She set the discarded cover on top of a nearby desk, before wiping away the sweat that had begun to form at her brow. Torin’s teachings had stretched her stamina to its limits; Perhaps her display of skill beforehand had set his expectations high. 

He was enthusiastic, if nothing else. The bishop was keen to see her skills, as well as test him. _Though he didn’t necessarily approach at a convenient time,_ she thought, frowning at the bishop’s back as he rummaged through his library. Even still, Afina appreciated having a motivated teacher, she had to admit. 

“Ah… Bishop Torin. If you would actually be so kind-- I have very much appreciated the added challenges you’ve poised for me, but I’m afraid that I told my escort that we would discuss return trip plas tonight.” Afina glanced toward the door, torn between asserting her position and meekly bowing out of the room. _You have friends to assist, and prestige as a princess,_ she thought, turning away to walk towards the door. The bishop began to protest and Afina mumbled a string of apologies, promising that they would continue training after a full night’s rest. “I’m awfully sorry, I am, but I would like to hold good on the promise I made to my traveling escort--.”
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina’s breath caught in her throat. No words were exchanged between the bishop and herself, but she could feel the sharp coolness of metal pressed firmly against her lower back. The princess froze, her hand still extended for the door, already beginning to shake. _I was a fool, a dumb fool, how could I have let this happen? This can’t be. Eraia wants to cultivate light mages. If he lays a hand on me, Callora will fight…,_ Afina thought, struggling to find words. The bishop cleared his throat.

“Afina. If you may. I believe we have unfinished business that we need to discuss.”
