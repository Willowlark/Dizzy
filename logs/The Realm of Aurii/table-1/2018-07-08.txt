Bill: Raive's head turns around, hand still outstretched for a tome on the top of his shelf. Despite half way through removing the book from it's resting place, he leaves it on the shelf as his body follows his head to face Afina. His eyes don't leave Afina's face as he picks up his cane from the spot it rested against his desk, nor while he walks back to his chair. Just as you begin to question the questioning look on his own face, he speaks. 

"My... apologies Princess. You must be mistaken, or Bishop Dean provided you false information. No other Callorian studies here." he says finally, slowly. His face then warms, giving you a comforting smile. "I wish it were the case, but you are assuredly our first Callorian student."

"Now, if it comes to those studying here you should meet, I can give you a run down of some of our most skilled practitioners. Fyil dabbles in the interaction between Light magic and natural forces, while Drinnral is our battle application expert. Of course there's Bishop Torin himself, who is a master of the written spell and researches spell runes in his spare time... Ah yes, and I suppose I could make this list as well, if you'd so choose. I regrettably spend less time on research than in my younger days, but I may have had a hand in the creation of pillar basis for spellcraft." He says, pretending to be arrogant with a smile on his face as he talks about himself. 

"I don't quite have the time now, but if you tell Bishop Torin your personal interests I'll be happy to introduce you to the proper people tomorrow." he suggests.
