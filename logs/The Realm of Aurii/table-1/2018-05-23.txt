Aldus (Jess): Aldus watches as Desii begins to treat Nokri’s injuries with a method and attention to detail that the blonde girl did not exhibit herself when she had attempted to treat Aldus’s own wounds weeks earlier. And she was so organized too! All her potions and poultices in an easy to access location Aldus id given new piece of mind knowing someone more capable was now prepared to treat him should the situation arise. 

Aldus is hardly surprised by Nokri’s little outburst. Rolling his eyes he drops graciously from the horse they had been sharing and saunters over to the two small women on the ground. 

“It would appear to me that she does indeed, know what she is doing, but I see you are as ungrateful for help as usual.” He turns his gaze away from the two of them as he reaches into his pack, extracting a waterskin and drops it on the ground next to the irritated woman. “As far as wounds go I am fine and should Eliran need help im sure Desii can take care of it. You’ve done little to prove yourself as the healer you claim to be, but Desii here has already proven her worth in less than one day with us. She does not deserve your nagging” His brows knit together in frustration as he looks again at the girl that he just risked life and limb for, questioning himself again. “I suggest you take some time to evaluate the events of the not only the past day but the past few weeks and seriously consider cleaning up your act. Our fount of undeserved kindness is bound to run out on you, unless you realise that there are people who would care for you if you would let them.” He turns on his heel making for a copse of trees nearby. Then pauses and turns back on the group for a second. “I’m going to take a walk, I’ll be back before we depart again”
