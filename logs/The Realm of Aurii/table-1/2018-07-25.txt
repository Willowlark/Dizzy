Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina’s mind was reeling as the sickeningly sour smell from the cloth filled her lungs. She coughed as the foul odor seemed to permeate her very being, and the princess’ head started spinning. _The avatar of Lylalel… acclimate away from… Callora… Knight..._ Fragments of thoughts drifted through the Callorian’s mind. She was only acutely aware of her legs kicking, her body struggling in protest. The bishop leaned in close, his dull gray eyes wide and feverish. Afina glared at him, focusing on every detail of his putrid face to stay conscious, her eyelids feeling heavy.

_Think hard. Master Witella trained you in self defense, to forget it now would be doing him a diservice_, Afina thought. Her mind flashed back to her youth.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ```
The cold of the stone floor seemed through Afina’s dress as she lay on her back in the study. Above her, a mural of the sky was painted in vivid blues and yellows on the ceiling, and the distant chirp of birds outside distracted her. “Afina, please,” her tutor said, though his tone was more coaxing than commanding, yet still firm. “This is important.” The young face of her tutor came into view, dark hair falling across his forehead, and gray eyes serious. “If you don’t know how to defend yourself, you’re shaping up to be a rather ineffective queen. 

Afina’s gaze shifted towards her tutor, who sat with legs crossed next to her. She sighed. “I know what to do. I have to fight back, right?”

“Precisely,” Witella nodded, sitting forward to place his hands on her neck. His touch was light and gentle. “And thus from here?”

The young princess pondered thoughtfully. “I should attack your eyes or neck or fingers,” she said with a sense of confident finality. 

“And?

“And make the attack as hard to do as possible!”

“Correct.”

Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina’s eyes watered as the stench of the chemical-coated fabric drifted off the cloth. Gritting her teeth, she gripped one of the bishop’s fingers in her fist and sharply tugged backwards. Her other hand moved to his face, her hand trembling with exertion as she tried to jam her thumb into a pressure point. His eyes, his nose, his skin. Afina growled as her body strained against the poison, as her legs already began to feel limp and useless beneath her. Even her efforts to break Bishop Dean’s finger failed; If anything, the bishop seemed more entertained by her resistance. 

Afina closed her eyes as the last of her strength left her. Her legs went limp. Her hands fell to her sides. A tear streamed down her face as she closed her eyes. _I can’t let him win… but I have no choice..._
