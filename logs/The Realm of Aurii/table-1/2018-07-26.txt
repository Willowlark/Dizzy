Elfriede (Tom): As Faun walked down the hallway his heart raced again. *Maybe they took her out for food? It's oddly silent now..* He couldn't help but feel like something was amiss. He picked up the pace. As he neared the classrooms Faun heard a deep **thud** from inside one of the rooms. His heart skipped a beat and he sprinted up to it shouting through it. 

‚ÄúHello?! What's happening in there?!‚Äù He went to open the door. **Locked**.

The light shuffling on the other side of the door and the silence concerned him deeply. 

‚ÄúPlease open the door, somebody!‚Äù he knocked heavily on the door.

His response being his voice echoing throughout the halls. Faun gritted his teeth. **I can't believe this!** Who is so damn foolish as to ignore me?! No priest of of the Good Lady...

He planted his feet firmly on the ground and pressed all his minor weight into the door hearing a very slight buckle. His weight wasn't going to do much, but.. He pressed upward leveraging his anchored feet with the floorboards trying to force the handle upward. The door cracked loudly but alas.. did not budge. 

‚ÄúLET ME IN DAMN YOU.‚Äù Elfriede placed his dagger firmly in the key hole and spun quickly kicking straight out, planting his boot firmly on the hilt slamming the dagger through the lock shattering the mechanism‚Ä¶ and his dagger. The door loudly popped and swung open slamming hard into the wall.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): A loud banging from the door jolted Afina's senses, dulled as they were. The bishop looked equally surprised as they heard a man's voice call through the door, and the cloth hovering away from Afina's mouth long enough for her to get a breath of fresh air. Invigorated with the new possibility of assistance, the princess pressed her advantage. _He's distracted by the door, I have a chance,_ she thought, glancing to the sides to see if she might be in range of a makeshift weapon. No such luck. 

_As difficult as possible..._ Afina thought, watching as the bishop, confident that the outsider posed no threat, turned back to her. He pressed the cloth firmly against her face, making it near impossible to breathe from anywhere but her mouth, but Afina held her breath. She balled her hand into a fight and punched upwards, connecting with the Eraian's throat. He wheezed, the air rushing from his lungs, but her attack did little to hinder him. The bishop smothered her face with the rag, forcing her to gasp and inhale the foul stench. She glared at him over the cloth, her arms and legs unresponsive, but mind fiercely fighting against the influence of the drug. 

The Callorian's eyelids fluttered as the weight of sleep pressed upon her. Truly, this time, it seemed that her fate was unavoidable. Not even outside intervention could save her from the bishop's plan; For once, Afina had been outsmarted by his hidden motives and preparations. 

Then, in an instance, the sound of shattering metal reverberated off the walls, and the bishop stood, still grasping his cloth in his hands. Afina coughed, rolling onto her side to try to get a straight sight of the door. Her arms trembled as she pushed herself onto her elbows, squinting in her attempt to see. Whoever had intruded upon the bishop had his full attention now.
Elfriede (Tom): The scene before him was one he could have never predicted. Faun's mouth dropped and hung open and his eyes widened. He felt like he couldn't breathe in that moment. Bishop crouching over an unconscious‚Ä¶ 

Everything was silent. In his face he felt waves of intense heat. He finally caught his breathe. Shakily his hand arose and grasped around the hilt of his sword and drew it. The metal sound reverberated off the walls of the classroom. Faun's face did not change.

The Bishop eyed his sword with disbelief. ‚ÄúYou dare?‚Äù he muttered self righteously.

Elfriede slowly leaned forwards and began walking towards the bishop swinging at him without remorse. 

Surprisingly swift for an older man he stumbled backwards causing Elfriede's wild swings to hit air.

Fauns mind racing, he'll never be able to forget that scene‚Ä¶ 

Torin scoffed and grabbed at his tomb that was always at his side, quickly firing off an easy spell fast as lightning.

Elfriede surprised at the disgusting mans dexterity, was forced back by small light bolts searing the ground.
Elfriede (Tom): As he reoriented himself he was bombarded with unbelievable burning in his right arm. A beam of light left Torins hand and landed squarely on his sword arm sending his rapier soaring and embedding itself in the wall behind him. Faun crying out in pain tore himself from the lights embrace making his way towards his sword. As he approached it he was met with a blinding flash as a wall of light was raised in front of it.


Elfriede already knew the pain such burning light would cause and turned back to the smirking Bishop. The knights gaze fell to the prone woman behind him and he winced in disbelief again. ***Was she even breathing?!***

Afina's eyes looked from one component of the newcomer to another. _Purple clothes... caramel hair... a rapier... those familiar amber eyes! Elfriede!_ The Callorian watched as Elfriede charged at the bishop, gaze stern and focused. _Of course! I didn't show up to help the others inside, it's only natural that Elfriede would question my absence! I have to help him,_ she thought, looking out in front of her at the books that lay in piles on the ground. Most were too far out of reach, especially as her body refused to cooperate. 

She reached an arm out towards the nearest tomes, praying that it was one of light magic. Her fingers brushed the heavy leather binding as she reached out. Her face was pale and damp with sweat; She had breathed in too much of the drug, and it was working its way through her body with debilitating efficiency. She had to help Elfriede. The clatter of metal and a flash of light made Afina turn, looking through the cracks in the hair that hung in her eyes. Elfriede gripped his arm, disarmed and wincing with the pain. Afina turned back to the nearest tomes, sitting at the top of a small stack. If she could just reach it...

The tower of books toppled over as Afina grabbed the tomes, and the bishop's attention turned suddenly back towards the princess. She locked eyes with the deranged man, and a shiver ran up her spine. He was crazed and powerful, a dangerous combination. The princess glanced over at Elfriede. He was tense, agitated, and clearly fearful. Afina nodded her head slightly; Even when it was herself in peril, she felt the need to comfort him that everything would be alright.
Elfriede (Tom): Faun gasped when Afina budged slightly. *She‚Äôs at least alive.* The Bishop turned to her with a sneer. Elfriede spat on the ground in sheer disgust of the man. *This asshole calls himself Eraian... You‚Äôre barely human.* 

Faun began his approach again, still holding his stinging arm tightly. He dodged left as the bishop fired a barrage of bolts at him, all barely missing the mark. Faun planted his left foot on the wall and soared towards the bishop overtop of his searing projectiles. He kicked towards the bishop‚Äôs head swiping air again. The Bishop leaning back, blasted faun with a quick but forceful spell sending him hard into the wall. 

Elfriede recovered and began running at the man again. Suddenly he paused and couldn't find his breathe. Torin had aimed his glowing hand towards Afina.

‚ÄúHalt you foolish lad! You clearly lack the discipline of Lady Lylalel!‚Äù he snarled at the knight lieutenant.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): The bishop towered over Afina, his hand glowing with a dangerous brilliance. He spoke the nonsensical language of light magic, but nonetheless his speech was violent and ominous. Afina looked around the bishop at the far corner of the room; Elfriede had been knocked back against the back wall, and was catching his breath. Afina turned her stare back to the bishop. _This is pathetic_, she thought. _Reduced to the floor, cowered like a cornered animal._

With a grunt, Afina threw her upper body at the nearest tomes, her useless legs limp beneath her. Her fingers slipped over the leather surface, and she tried to yell in frustration. Her voice came out as a quiet, pained "no!" as the bishop strode to face her. He squatted down, using his hand to lift Afina's chin to face him. 

"Forgive me, I would never mean to taint such an image of Lylalel herself. But one must do what is for the good of her light," he said, standing straight. Afina's gaze followed him, brows furrowed in confusion and concentration. Suddenly, the bishop raised his shoe, and with a resounding finality, brought it down upon Afina's outstretched hand. The princess yelped in pain, whining softly as she cradled her hand back towards her body. She tried to move her fingers; To no avail, it was most definitely broken. Tears streamed down her cheeks as the religious man walked away from her, leaving the princess to succumb to the influence of the drugs.
Elfriede (Tom): **Crack** the resounding sound that he was helpless to prevent stung him like an arrow through the heart. **Fina‚Ä¶ I'm sorry..** he grimaced heavily fighting back tears to no avail. Her crying face..

He remembered the nights they shared in a flash, bonding and getting closer. 

Before he knew it his legs were pedalling forward again. Elfriede felt this man in that moment was below the worst demon. 

Flashes of light soared at him again which he ducked and weaved out of the way of until he finally go close to the man again. Elfriede saw an opening through his tears and threw a punch at Torin. The sly bishop blocked it with his tomb and promptly kneed Faun in the gut reeling him over. 

Time seemed to slow down as he eyed Afina, his friend‚Ä¶ more than that‚Ä¶ she clutched her hand close to her chest. 

She seemed so helpless, *Afina*. **helpless**. How dispicable of a man must he be to have tricked her into this position. Elfriede gritted his teeth in the purest rage he's ever felt. He raised his head up at the smirking Bishop, whose face suddenly twisted with disgust at Faun. 

The knight lieutenant jumped towards Torin who held a hand up to stop his approach. Terror seemed written on the man's face which was a welcome sight. Elfriede‚Äôs canine jaw and bulging wolf like muscle began to form. Hair came out of every surface of his body. His piercing amber eyes still locked with Torin, this earless chestnut furred wolf truly looked like a monster. The wolf's jaws clenched down with incredible force around Torins neck tearing into it. Blood ran thick staining the man's robes and the fur around Faun's mouth as he flailed to push the snarling beast off of him.
