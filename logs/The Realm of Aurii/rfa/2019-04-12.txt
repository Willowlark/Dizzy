Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): V in a nutshell
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): MysMe logic: two people logged into the same chat room while they're sitting next to each other in a car and one of them is driving
N🆗ri (Marisa): *they're at a rest stop*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh never mind when Seven said "it must be hard sleeping in a cabin", he meant an actual cabin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Not the cabin of a car lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol drunk Yoosung 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH THERE'S THE BEST CALL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"I gave him one (1) shot. I didn't think he was this much of a lightweight..."*

Aldus Larian (Jess): V: literally driving the RFA to drink since 2016
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven what the fuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like a baby bird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, it took 4 playthroughs, but I finally got 100% on all days! (With the exception of the party)
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yaaaay! Congrats 🎉
Aldus Larian (Jess): You prob already know this but sevens route leads to the "secret endings" which are 14 7-15 min episodes. Each one costs hourglasses but they are all on YouTube
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OwO

Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye!  He has a standard after end and then like a whole goddamn movie 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): V gets the same thing ~~and hopefully saeran plz cheritz~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well I think vs is only 7 total but still alot more than the other characters
Aldus Larian (Jess): I watched it on some girl YouTube channel that was doing g a let's play but she kept pronouncing "saeran" as "sar-E-an" like as in cesarean section 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but don't I need to unlock the secret endings to unlock other things
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like dlc?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah don't I need it to unlock Rika's thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think you might need it to unlock V's after end an the Rika thing ~~which are also on youtube~~ as far as I know
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've kind of already accepted the fact I'm going to eventually be throwing money at Cheritz for hourglasses eventually lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah I was wondering if there was more for Seven's route because it's like the 8am chat and then party and I'm like *but, they're still looking for Saeran???*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea there's ALOT more
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rika's behind story will be unlocked upon unlocking After Ending's Secret 01
