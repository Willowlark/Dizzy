Bill: Imma start playing MM again so I have a bunch of peoples messages to read in the morning. Itâ€™s a good feeling.

Bill: *bitch*
Bill: THAT FACE
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao its great
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Thats good art
Bill: Anyone have the mystic messenger comic link?
Bill: From WEBTOON?
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/mc/list?title_no=69383
Bill: Thank
Bill: Your words do not match your actions MC
Bill: Oof mc2.
Aldus Larian (Jess): She's fine
Bill: Zen route vibes?
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's either zen or seven
Bill: I would have guessed Seven but seems pretty Zen. Unless she backs down cause of Jaehee, which would be cute I guess. Supporting Jaehee.
Bill: Ray x MC2 tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't know how they're going to handle saeran and mc2 if it's not sevens route but it would be interesting to see
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA I love when she's like "do you like cats" and he's like "i... Don't know?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "So what do you like?" "Ice cream"
Bill: I guess that from Ray route?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nope
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean he says he likes ice cream in the game but it's not ripped from the game. The Saeran parts are more fan made then the main MC parts in the comic
Bill: I like em.
Bill: The main stuff is pretty cookie cutter.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea! The Saeran parts are more exciting cuz they aren't in the game
Aldus Larian (Jess): So far the only part from another story is him using the name "Ray" and the appearance of the believers robes? I think?
