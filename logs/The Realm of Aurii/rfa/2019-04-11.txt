Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Y'all seen this yet? ~~probably~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/mc/list?title_no=69383
Bill: 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): No i have not!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh thats a way better floorplan
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the whole thing is really well drawn
Aldus Larian (Jess): MC 2! Ahhhhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ommmgggg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 3 and 4 are in it too
Aldus Larian (Jess): This art is giving me life
Aldus Larian (Jess): Everyone looks so beautiful 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Fight fight fight
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bitch it might be
Aldus Larian (Jess): BIH thats not your name <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hnnnng i need more
Bill: Yo I said this and really just wanted the seven cry react.
Bill: I need my own set of mystic messenger emotes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "It was me V-io"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im sorry that was really bad but it just reminded me of that
Bill: lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): do we make emotes of ourselves or our aurii characters first
Bill: Oh I'd use the crap out of emojis of myself so.
Bill: ~~I have no dedicated Aurii character either~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): *fix that*
Bill: Oh MY **GOD** Zen is a cuck.
Bill: Signs in and starts attacking Jumin for talking about Elizabeth the third.
Bill: *Give me more chances to break his heart, I’ll do it*
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Biru... do u even like this game?~~
Bill: Oh yeah.
Bill: I’m enjoying it thoroughly.
Bill: But Zen is just an ass.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no he's an actor
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh... cuz you really havnt said anything positive about it
Aldus Larian (Jess): So i thought you werent enjoying it
N🆗ri (Marisa): he writes all the positive stuff in his diary
N🆗ri (Marisa): he has one of those whatsitcalled
N🆗ri (Marisa): password journals
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Like Yoosung Annoying but not ill intentioned. Jaehee I like a lot, more than I expected, cause I just wanna help her with her work. Jumin is an odd bird, am excited to have some jumin specific content after today/tomorrow. I like Seven, but high energy, but that’s his default mode and when I’m not trying to get into Jumin’s route I’d be happy to play along.
Bill: And V is great. What a meme.
Bill: Lol I’m making all these memes and jokes because I’m having fun.
Bill: If I was bored I’d quit.
Bill: I just. Hate Zen. In this route anyway. He drags Jumin for being rich, for loving his pet, like. Just. Don’t talk to Jumin then.
Bill: Oh I don’t like the party guest emails. They’re boring.
Bill: But is w/e.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea the emails suck
N🆗ri (Marisa): you gotta do the emails properly for a good ending
Bill: Yeah I’m working on it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yoosung matures a bit by the end. Still annoying, but he gets quite a bit of character development
Bill: Ye.
Bill: I don’t hate him for being immature. He just is.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea yoosung save da day
Bill: Zen arrogant and I don’t like it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Zen's route Jaehee was really annoying because she kept cockblocking you
Bill: Be narcissistic if you want, but don’t bash other people.
Bill: I can deal with him being a flirt. I just can’t stand his jumin bashing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah that's annoying in Deep Story
Aldus Larian (Jess): The whole rfa kinda bashes jumin 😬
Aldus Larian (Jess): Esspcially in his route
Bill: Also I wish there were ways to choose answers and get hearts independently. I stopped caring about what I say and basically pick the one with the best chance of getting a heart.
Bill: It takes me out of character so to speak.
Bill: Everyone gives him crap, but Zen just. Berates him for things that aren’t offensive or wrong. Being born rich, loving his cat.
Bill: Jaehee fucking justified to be a little mean.
Bill: Jumin ain’t a perfect guy here.
Bill: Seven... idk Seven mostly seems to troll rather than SHIT on.
Bill: Girls gotta stick together. Once I’m fucking Jumin (phrasing) imma get that girl a vacation.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Actually yea
Bill: Actually yes what?
Aldus Larian (Jess): That happens
Bill: Lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jaehee's Day Off™
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo also not that it matters but part of the reason zen dislikes jumin so juch is becuase hes projecting his brotger unto him
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jumin doesnt repect that zen is allergic to cats and basically tells him to get over it, jumin pays his employees well but doesnt treat them like actual people and is extremy unempathetic which zen cant understand.
Bill: Tldr go to hell Lily you wont be sleeping for a week
N🆗ri (Marisa): jumin needs to drink some respecting people juice
Aldus Larian (Jess): Not saying that zens treatment of jumin is always justified but jumins not perfect eityer, and can also get pretty "mean"
N🆗ri (Marisa): he literally makes zen eat cat food
Aldus Larian (Jess): None of the characters are always right (except jaehee maybe lololol) or always nice (except maybe v)
N🆗ri (Marisa): do ray and saeran count as different people
Bill: Yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ray is a sweetheart but he still gets mad and isnt always right  (brainwashing ™ )
Bill: Not saying I’ll always hate Zen. But the chats I’ve seen are putting him in a shit light.
N🆗ri (Marisa): #raydidnothingwrongeverinhiswholelife
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hes nice to MC but he isnt always *nice* in general
Bill: ~~these messages were accompanied by the sound of Jess squealing~~
Bill: It’s also dat boi.
Bill: And WHERE ARE MY V hearts damnit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh you can't get v hearts unless you're in another story <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): In another story
Aldus Larian (Jess): When i went back to causal i was like "where tf are my teal and pink hearts?!"
Bill: Okay game branches next thing.
Bill: Midnight?
Bill: Also fucccck I should have gone to bed an hour and a half ago.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it day 4? branch should be soon. usually before midnight
N🆗ri (Marisa): 11:15 chat time guide says

N🆗ri (Marisa): naw that's progression <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Woo!
N🆗ri (Marisa): **let the suffering commence**
Bill: That’ll be me waking up tomorrow with no sleep.

N🆗ri (Marisa): he's here to help the hamburgers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/abe-simpson-YnmEsq9ICSYQ8
N🆗ri (Marisa): i accepted the award i won weeb of the month
N🆗ri (Marisa): what an honor
N🆗ri (Marisa): ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): I hate the emails 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm been...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ...mostly cheating for the emails...
Aldus Larian (Jess): I always get like way over 10 but I hate them
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I cheat too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so far I'm at 100%
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***scandalous***
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i cheat but *i didn't mean to it just happened*~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): the game wouldn't save my answers so i was able to redo them every time i got it wrong
Aldus Larian (Jess): NICE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm at 31 guests
Aldus Larian (Jess): I always like get to day 4 when the emails start and I'm like "fuck I forgot about this part"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Errybody commin to da party
N🆗ri (Marisa): the emails are pretty easy tho so at least i don't have to redo it often
Aldus Larian (Jess): After 10 I stop caring and kinda just guess
N🆗ri (Marisa): how many are there total?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I remember my first playthrough I gave up at "meow meow meow meow'
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was like "nope that's it I'm done I'm cheating"
N🆗ri (Marisa): the long cat one? that's one of the easiest though
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's all in the punctuation they give the answers away
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then the guests in another story are just all memes
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you read the e-mail just match the response with what it says in the letter
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah they just went hog wild for that
Aldus Larian (Jess): They knew the fan base was done
Aldus Larian (Jess): Another story is fucking wild
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): the first response is obviously "meow meow," because you're writing a letter to a guest
then miumiumi! because longcat used an exclamation point in their message so you gotta match their enthusiam
same for nyanyan!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Classic UI
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's like a real business letter
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea! Just like that!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): That can go along with saeran "deleting" seven
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't spend too much time on your computer kids
N🆗ri (Marisa): sequels to [screaming in korean]

N🆗ri (Marisa): oh, you don't know?
N🆗ri (Marisa): the hidden bachelor............
N🆗ri (Marisa): Him™.............
Aldus Larian (Jess): Green hair man
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe it's an OC
N🆗ri (Marisa): the protagonist of another another story
N🆗ri (Marisa): the oc who's gonna show up at a photoshoot meetup
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no
Aldus Larian (Jess): Plz no
N🆗ri (Marisa):

Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): That sums it up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): eh, looking at it now, I don't like that character placement... this was a tough one to meme
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jumin wouldn't call her Jaehee
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh true
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but it worked because Jaehee sounds similar to Jackie lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@184437198865563648>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Bill: I don't want Jumin to hire a bodyguard, I want Jumin to be my bodyguard. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bold of you to assume he's capable of doing anything himself
Aldus Larian (Jess): "I will pay you 1 million won not to hurt her"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Bill: He's capable of putting things between MC and Unknown.
Bill: Like a cage. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh, found out in Seven's route he's also a skilled golfer. Didn't know that before
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea juju the golf man
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unknown on jumins route:
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin is live action tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so based on Seven's route (and probably the others), Mint Eye is a several hour drive away... ||how the *fuck* did Elizabeth run all the way there?||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||kittynapping||
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||^||
Bill: || As opposed to Unknown pussynapping?||
Aldus Larian (Jess): also the longest is takes to get from one corner of south korea to the other is like 3 hrs but YA KNOW
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): || <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> ||
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye I thought we had this discussion before
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh probably
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I remember either you or Marisa saying that
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have terrible memory XD

Bill: Like Sarah obviously a gold digger or some shit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT?  nahhhh def NOTHING like that <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Him talking to Elizabeth about his ties is such a mood though.
Bill: Already more satisfied being in a route. The early days are too surface level, now I get to appreciate the character's properly.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well yea
Bill: Visual novels have always been hard for me to get into for that reason.
Aldus Larian (Jess): this is the only one ive ever played so idk
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ahh Sarah
Aldus Larian (Jess): Echo Girl, Glam Choi, and Sarah Choi
The three harbingers of the apocalypse

Aldus Larian (Jess): you cant
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait you arnt doing everyone route tho right?
Bill: Nah. Jumin, V, probably Seven.
Aldus Larian (Jess): the only say to let saeran die is with other characters bad ends
Bill: ~~I'm teasing I don't want to kill Ray~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good news, God's coming to the party
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol that sad as af song they play during sevens route is literally called "my half is unknown"
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im loling at this comment:
"Everyone is so hurt in this game and they all need some hugs and therapy please someone save them all and I can't do it because I'm broke﻿"
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: *ooooh noooo, did a girl on the street yell at him for being a dumb fuck?*
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn your just as bad as him
Bill: ?
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol you get as mad to see zen as he gets when he sees jumin
Bill: faiiiiir but he's just. such a tool.
Bill: I know he was your first love but.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Zen would be the first RFA member to beat someone up for MC
N🆗ri (Marisa): After unknown
Aldus Larian (Jess): im jus saying you dont have all the info <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): But he’s not in the RFA
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~thats not what his wiki page says~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): SAERAN PLZ JUST LISTEN TO SEVEN 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH MAN ITS THE GOOD PART
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Going to risk our lives trying to expose the truth...
... but first, let me take a selfie
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA u gotta
Aldus Larian (Jess): the most intense session of "get out of my room"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): more like "stay in my room while I run away"
Aldus Larian (Jess): true XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): im rewatching it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven: "oh this must be the server room"
MC: "YOO das a nice computer"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): "yo call yoosung over we gon rage all night on this thing"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I chose "Do you think Saeran hacked into our system here?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, no shit Sherlock
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats the right answer XD
Bill: 
Bill: On a personal level he pissing me off that his “dilemma” is he feels weird after being told how good looking his is.
Bill: Also I mean. You don’t have to accept Jumin’s guard. Unknown’ll appreciate it I’m sure.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unknown watching Zen refuse guards: "FOOL"
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone tell me to work and not rewatch seven route day 10
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hate that main story isnt fully voiced 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): in another story you get the twins mom yelling in its full terrifying intensity
Aldus Larian (Jess): you also get saerans VA trying his very best to sounds like a chils
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I thought mama Choi was voiced
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh shit is she, gotta go back
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): last story mode of Day 9
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yup!
Aldus Larian (Jess): well theres even more in another story!
Aldus Larian (Jess): she guilt trips saeran for "making saeyoung so sick you he he left"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): its a great time
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont understand why side characters are voiced but not main ones in the VNs
N🆗ri (Marisa): budget cuts <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): like we dont need the side characters to even have voices XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): escuse? MC is brainwashed? boi u beeta find yourself a mirror
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *brainwashed with **love***
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven: *tells him the truth*
Saeran: "well that sounds insane!"
MC internally: <:lenny:395307171539189760>  you live in a fucking cult
Aldus Larian (Jess): Saeran: *tells his side*
All the MCs: 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): SAVE THIS BOY 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): petition for cheritz to go back and voice the main story
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): petition for cheritz to animate bits of the main story ~~even though that kind of defeats the point of a VN~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): even if it's like, very minimal animation like in the opening
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like blinking and hair moving
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that would be really coo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lots of modern visual novels on PC have animated sprites
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's not far fetched
Aldus Larian (Jess): when seven shows saeran the picks i was fully expecting him to be like "these are just pics of you" 😤
Aldus Larian (Jess): nyoom there he go
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *didn't he say that? or did I read it wrong*
Aldus Larian (Jess): no hes like "how did you get these?!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): basically tells him he lying, he got the pics by hacking and wrote the letter from rika himself
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ah I misread "Why is that photo with you" and took it as "That's a photo of you"
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea! i think i read it wrong the first time too
Aldus Larian (Jess): he means "why do you have it"
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then its denial time <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Next story mode "He hacked to steal that photo"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): YUP
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh man this part so good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait are u at the next VN or did you just guess?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): finished the next VN
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): classic mixup
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): its so cliche but i love it 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): OOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): he does call vanderwood sevens assistant!
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): i always figured he was talking about jumin when he says "I want an assistant too"
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz seven makes a lot more sense
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like how Saeran just cycles through all Seven's names
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Saeyoung betrayed me!
You're Luciel's assistant!
I'M NOT 707!
Aldus Larian (Jess): he just like picks one at random XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): vandys like "youve fuckinf lost it now"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "you're the *only* person who wont give in even with a gun to your face" guess not 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): V's blinder than i thought
Aldus Larian (Jess): "saeran, i can see your roots all the way from here, and im blind!"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): V's face is literally <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven: "Ill join the agency to protect my brother"
Agency *kidnaps brother thinking its him*
Seven: <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>  "there seems to have been a slight flaw in my planning"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Vanderwood showing up put me in a David Bowie mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh so I want to draw a comic of Seven praying for the first time in a long time and starting off with "Hey there, God. It's me, ya boi"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yes plz
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's amazing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also kind of want to do a wholesome one of him going to confession and having like, no clue what to do but the priest being super nice and helping him through it and then giving him good advice to help him feel like a better person
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then finishing off with
