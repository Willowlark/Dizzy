N🆗ri (Marisa): i can hear the shutter sound! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: I can't and you didn't tell me to shut up 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa is physically incapable of saying the words "shut up"
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe i can say shyaddap
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol the one where they're on their phones literally right next to each other is the most canon photo

Elfriede Faun (Tom): No I like both tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oo I can post a link to the full file, gimme a few minutes everything is leaking
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AHHH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Water leak?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee <:pew:543202259085950996>
the third floor is leaking rain from outside, the broken valve on the toilet wasn't properly turned so the bathroom is flooded and the tiles are cracking, and the water from the toilet drips down into the kitchen so the kitchen floor is soaked and i hope it stops dripping 🙀 I didn't notice because i didn't hear the dripping noises and i didn't go into the bathroom until recently
the kitchen faucet also leaks but only if you turn it on which i did to give sylvia more water haha oops
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no! 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): just don't zoom in to see the horrible cutting job i did <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): its good to see your prioritizes are in order
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hope you're able to deal with the leaks 😦
N🆗ri (Marisa): it should be manageable once it stops
hopefully 🙏 
the third floor there's not really much we can do. there's been a lawsuit for that in the works for like three years.
hopefully the kitchen ceiling doesn't collapse eyy
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): its there a window up there?
N🆗ri (Marisa): kiiiiiiind of? there's supposed to be a skylight but it was covered up by a previous owner, so the roof is over it and there's bubblewrap under it and it flaps around when it's windy
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/0/0e/707_mystic_messenger_1_by_afiilen-daeys8f.gif/revision/latest?cb=20190404111540
Aldus Larian (Jess): what emotion is this?
Aldus Larian (Jess): rip its not animated ive failed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Get rid of all the tex after .gif
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't even remember him ever using that one lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like a very specific emotion i cant explain
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): when people tell him off for not being serious or when he's bored i think
Aldus Larian (Jess): when erik teaches me how to use gifs correctly ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA its like so specific
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like "lol" but like with some other energy thrown in
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like "LOL" with "dont tell me what to do" energy and a lil but of "you dont know ME, you done know MY LIFE"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yesss thank you!
Also sorry to hear it 😭 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): i love how you used the explosion cg from the game 👌
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH IS IT?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WOAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): IS IT? I think that's a coincidence I just used a random image from google :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): DID CHERITZ USE GOOGLE
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait is it?
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe i just thought it was
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 😱
N🆗ri (Marisa): they do look alike
how suspicious
Aldus Larian (Jess): i thought it was this one ngl
Aldus Larian (Jess): I am a fool
N🆗ri (Marisa): it should have been
you are living in the year 3019
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have been bamboozled
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to sue cheritz
Aldus Larian (Jess): but then how will i get rays after end
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is that when you get a bad ending and the bomb explodes?
N🆗ri (Marisa): sue them with the after ending as the price
i think it's from another story? is that right
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah seven sends it sometimes when hes "joking"
N🆗ri (Marisa): o
N🆗ri (Marisa): OOH YEAH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oooooh
Aldus Larian (Jess): he like "oh yea if the securtiy system is triggered then..." and then sends that pic
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then hes like "LOLOL JK i wish i saw your face just now"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that explains why I have it in my common gallery lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea!
Aldus Larian (Jess): the common gallery is great for reliving all the weird stuff that happens
Aldus Larian (Jess): like seven hacking jumins comapny website and putting longcats all over it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THAT ONE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which route was that?
Aldus Larian (Jess): jaehees
Aldus Larian (Jess): mint eye needs a graphic designer so badly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Show me on this doll where the bad mad touched you...*
Aldus Larian (Jess): " ~~show me on this doll where youd like to touch me~~"
Bill: Your kinky sode is showing MC.
Bill: Jumin that was *inspirational* DAMN
Bill: *what* a guy.
Bill: Minus the... *bit* excessive possessive streak I wanna confess that smooth damn.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im not sure exactly what part your talking about but im sure it was swoon worthy
Bill: Day 8, he tells Sarah to fuck off by kissing MC.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): FUCK SARAH
Bill: Then he like 'I love you, and want to know all of you. I'll do anything to give you everything you could ever want'.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): BUT NOT ACTUALLY BECAUSE YIKES
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA the way he tells sarah to fuck off is amazing
Aldus Larian (Jess): i love when hes like "ha i saw this in a soap opera and always wanted to say this" or whatever
Bill: Jumin no dont go back to your 50 shades mode
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~you can do things for him that that Elizabeth could never~~
Bill: Hold up now im getting those “am I on the bad end vibes again” buddy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *I just complimented you for being cool don't get all over the top again*
Bill: sigh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ha
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin, not over the top
Aldus Larian (Jess): you're funny
Aldus Larian (Jess): i read the tags on this fic wrong and now im three chapters into a jumin/seven fic and i was getting really confused as to why it was so gay
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): But the irony of glam choi unknowingly telling the prime ministers secret son that he isnt "high profile" enough for jumin was pretty funny
Aldus Larian (Jess): and seven cross dressing as woman whoowee
Bill: Zen: having a point
Bill: I mean. Hes not. That far from the truth.
Bill: Shit youre right i dont know how to use a front door
Aldus Larian (Jess): bold of you to assume jumin's guards would let you use a front door
Bill: Sigh. He's back to meme land.
Bill: JuuuuuUUUUMMMIIiiiinnnnnnn
Bill: ,...
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's trying his best
Bill: Heart: daww
Body: *facepalm*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Heart: aww
Body: aww yeee
Brain: WAiT NooOO
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: The things you get away with when you *bangin*
Bill: ~~still not sure if I'm on a good ending~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just keep playing to find out <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think your fine, jumins just got alotta issues
Bill: Even if you put aside the 'they met a week ago' thing, some of that language is like... red flag.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~that's normal~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh are you surprised? 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~for Jumin at least~~
Bill: look after all this time I thought kink daddy Jumin Han was more meme than reality.
Bill: Or particularly, more bad end than normal ending.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo yeeeaaa not really, he's worst in this day I think?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what day is it?
Bill: I'd hope so. Maybe it's just cause I'm reserved/shy/~~a loser~~/passive but I can't imagine saying any of these things without them being followed by a shout of 'pervert' and getting arrested. He's straddling that line man.
Bill: 8.
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's too rich and powerful for that to happen, the police wouldn't be able to touch him
Bill: Like I get possessive (you can read that two ways) and being flirty, but neither are appropriate at this point?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean IRL yea
N🆗ri (Marisa): he misses elizabeth
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): looking ahead at some of the SM's and yeah today's pretty bad lol
Bill: I'm technically on day 9 I gotta catch up.
Bill: Me, but Mystic Messenger today
Bill: But like it's actually true.
N🆗ri (Marisa): mc vs sarah
Aldus Larian (Jess): haha throwback to playing zens route and he had like one line that was like "You're all mine" and i was like "welp thats a little weird" and then i played jumin next and i was like "nope nope nope ok time to go back to zen" and by then end of jumins i was like "this is normal"
Aldus Larian (Jess): (the line was more indepth then that i just cant remeber it)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😂 lol yup
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin makes zen look like an angel
Bill: Yoosung literally was just like "I hope Jumin knows a relationship isn't owning a woman" and I
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah zen is possessive but pales in comparison
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the best part of Zen's route was Jumin trying to convince him to take a modeling job for cat products and have him wear cat ears
Bill: ~~Zen's definitely into dungeon porn~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Playing Zen's route: *I want to spend the night*
Zen: *Nope can't let you. I might not be able to contain myself*

Playing Jumin's route: *I want to go home*
Jumin: *Nope I can't let you. You might leave me forever*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA thats exactly is
Bill: That face doesnt match the words hes saying
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen: I might not be be able to contain myself around you
MC: I dont want you to?
Zen: <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh this part is a TRIP
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I rewatched one of Zen's story modes and there were three different responses in the same SM saying I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU
N🆗ri (Marisa): lunch with jumin 🥘
Aldus Larian (Jess): say what you will about Zen but hes a goddamn gentleman
Bill: I thought the options were supposed to be 
> normal
> kinky
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Bill: Not 
> normal
> *actually afraid of being kept as a pet*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, Zen has really good gaydar apparently
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because he worked with a gay guy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): once
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen plz
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Zen: I think [respecting women] is basic stuff.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Be like Zen 😎
Bill: Like damn tho he went from “probably has a bondage kink” to “aww he loves you that much” and then nose dived into “am I gunna get raped” like.
Aldus Larian (Jess): *chuckles* I am in danger
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): also, the way Zen is ready to FIGHT seven for the apartment address 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes like "fuck what V said" <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: ~~if you switch the Mr Han sprites this would get real dark real fast~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: ~~time to associate with one of the other rich pretty boys~~
Bill: ~~my options are self deprecating, manipulated compulsive liar or meme lord with a brother complex~~
Bill: Gotta drive home and do most of day 9.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~or ya know you could just not associate~~
Bill: But how will I know which boi to ship MC with.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ship all
Bill: That’s a V bad end. 😏
Aldus Larian (Jess): those are just random cultists tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo nvm that cg is actually 2 years later wow
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): the wiplash of jumins route of OMG MC I LOVE U NEVER LEAVE to seven like: MC GET AWAY FROM ME was like <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: ~~Also associating with negative traits is like <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>~~
