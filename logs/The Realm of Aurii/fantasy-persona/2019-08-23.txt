Bill: Never seen it.
Nokri (Marisa): why make the sauna look so fancy if it doesn't do anything smh
Bill: Because you spent a ridiculous amount of time in the monastery?
Nokri (Marisa): I’m just making sure there’s nothing to miss and maximizing everything I can
Nokri (Marisa): But the sauna is just. There.
