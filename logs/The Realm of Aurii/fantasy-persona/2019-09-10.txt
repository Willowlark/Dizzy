Bill: Does reading show his dedication to lady Rhea? If so, yes.
Bill: (I don‚Äôt actually know)

Bill: Weird. She was the first staff member I was able to get.
Bill: Must be cause NG+.

Nokri (Marisa): it's not that she wouldn't join me, it's that the option never showed up
Bill: ~~that's not a spoiler, you said that above~~
Bill: Huh.
Bill: Weirder still.
Nokri (Marisa): *goes back to join the church for hilda*
Nokri (Marisa): i still have all her lost junk too, it was impossible to interact with hilda and give her all the lost items she dropped
Nokri (Marisa): ||you're only able to do that in the third month bUT I'M STUCK IN THIS CAMP FOR EXPLORATION DAY||

Nokri (Marisa): He‚Äôs more popular than Flayn
Bill: Flayn's pretty boring tbh
Bill: Seteth is a meme
Nokri (Marisa): *you take that back*
Bill: He's probably the only other Church aligned character beside Byleth who'll get attention.
Bill: I mean, you let her die. :3
Nokri (Marisa): No she‚Äôs not dead
Nokri (Marisa): ||she sided with the church so she left my class||

Nokri (Marisa): ||who do i kill first. who would it be less painful to have the other watch die.||
Nokri (Marisa): ||i read last night that if byleth finishes off a character, they retreat, but if anyone else attacks then the character dies. So I think Flayn and seteth are ok in my route but Gilbert‚Äôs a goner lol rip||
Bill: 
Bill: I love Seteth with a full beard, he looks much less like 'vice principal' and much more 'Aragorn, king of Gondor'.
