Bill: Add superhot to the list of indie games porting themselves to switch because Switch has a great thing going.
Bill: Gamestop apparently will let you trade in an older model switch for the new one, with a 75 dollar cost. Which is cheaper than 300.
Bill: That said, system transferring seems like a pain.

Bill: Got it to enlarge on a different site... Blurry at zoom, but maybeh a few photoshop sharpens...
Bill: ~~or just vector it and not be lazy~~
Bill: totally unrelated, Erik where did you order the BNE flag from?

Aldus Larian (Jess): oo i sowwy is hard to keep track of whos who cuz i no has game
Nokri (Marisa): People are always tip toeing around her because of their families political stuff but she tells them not to, and she always stays behind to train with people even if she finished her own training, and sheâ€™s not afraid of making mistakes
Nokri (Marisa): In fighting/training or speaking
Like, she is, but she makes them anyway because she knows thatâ€™s fine
