Bill: Meanwhile Sylvain and Dimitri: “don’t worry your highness, disappointing girls is what I’m best at”
Bill: Huh. Kinda funny that Dimitri and Edelgard are so head over heels to follow Byleth’s orders. They’re next in line to two of the largest nations on the continent. I doubt they’ve ever been ordered around by anyone.
Nokri (Marisa): That’s the appeal, they finally have a sensei to look up to
Nokri (Marisa): Byleth is the new cool kid in town who can murder an opponent in one hit and has neat stories about the world, everyone looks up to them
