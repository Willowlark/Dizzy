Nokri (Marisa): WAIT
Nokri (Marisa): IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH
Nokri (Marisa): IT CAN BE BIGGER
Nokri (Marisa): PLANT 4 IN A SQUARE AND WAIT

El🆓de Faun (Tom): WOAHH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 2 plants per Field?!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Do I need to keep using the giantizee toget em that big?
Nokri (Marisa): Oo naw, this 4 thing!
Nokri (Marisa): Unless that’s what you did jfkdlsbsk
Nokri (Marisa): Sometimes you just let it sit, sometimes it needs more gigantizer. If you have the magnifying glass it should stay around 3
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah that's what I did!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh there's a stat for it?
Bill: Can we talk about how the sword of the creator has a hilt as wide as Byleth’s shoulders and is nearly as tall as Byleth; yet Byleth wields it one handed like a freaking pool toy?
Bill: Late game spoiler: || Is it some form of narcissism that Rhea is Seiros and she’s enforcing the teaching of Seiros, which is about being reverent TO Seiros, so she’s basically killing people for not worshipping her? ||
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah

Bill: ~~Hilda ain't a rabbit unless she's the Monty Python kinda rabbit~~
Andrew: Bernie the hamster
Bill: boi I hope fem Byleth doesn't look as ridiculous in the englightened one class as Male Byleth.
Bill: Oh, so I realized the other day Byleth spends their entire life pre the monastery working for their father's mercenary group, with no knowledge of the church or politics of the land, and still manages to wear a professor's cloak as daily attire.
Bill: Maybe *that's* what Rhea saw in Byleth.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I think if I went back and played awakening I'd choose Sully or Panne, they were great
Bill: Panne maybe, Sully?
Bill: Meh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Panne is bae
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Made this one a while back. This was my elf druid DnD character
Bill: Panne and her son, V something.
Bill: He was a bean.
Bill: That game had beans.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Sully is great
Bill: You know what else has beans?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then with his pet dire wolf, Sparky
Bill: Damn Andrew, Dimitri look good late game
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yarne was her son

Bill: yeeeee
Bill: He's like, a better flirt than Sylvain.
Bill: Cause he smooth.
Bill: That was literally his support with Ignatz. "You want to meet the goddess? and you think she's hot? Well you're going to be tongue tied so bring me along. I'll ask her to tea and for a dance"
Bill: Huh. Ingrid has a crest of a noble house that's based in the Alliance.
Andrew: Isnt it galatea? They're on the border but still kingdom I think
Bill: She grew up there, her crest is Daphnel.

Bill: ~~fem Byleth is on sale~~
Bill: Claude's is the only one they fucked up, according to the pictures. 😭
Nokri (Marisa): dimitri and edelgard's are wrong too
Nokri (Marisa): edelgard's is entirely wrong
Bill: I don't think there are any missing pieces that warp the look though.
Andrew: If only I had the cash
Nokri (Marisa): they gave her a skirt instead of high waisted shorts, the cravat is all wrong, the top is too long, her sleeves are missing the puff at the top and the gold pleats on the shoulder. those are the main issues with edel
Andrew: But making is so much fun
Andrew: Truth but what do you expect from these sites
Bill: How do they have *Jeritz* and not *Seteth*
Andrew: It's like my robin cloak is missing a lot of detail
Andrew: RIP bill
Bill: I mean, I don't wanna be Seteth but.
Bill: It's so weird.
Bill: They are running a 20% off sale for Fire Emblem, but most of that 30 bucks off ends up going to shipping. for Dimitri
Bill: Aww, you can't stack the halloween discount on it.
Andrew: A little out of my range rn
Bill: I was just seeing how much you could possibly get off it.
Andrew: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like how the heart stays
