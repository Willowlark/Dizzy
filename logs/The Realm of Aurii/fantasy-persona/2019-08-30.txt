El氣電e Faun (Tom): Yeah that's what I did!
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Oh there's a stat for it?
Bill: Can we talk about how the sword of the creator has a hilt as wide as Byleth窶冱 shoulders and is nearly as tall as Byleth; yet Byleth wields it one handed like a freaking pool toy?
Bill: Late game spoiler: || Is it some form of narcissism that Rhea is Seiros and she窶冱 enforcing the teaching of Seiros, which is about being reverent TO Seiros, so she窶冱 basically killing people for not worshipping her? ||

Andrew: Bernie the hamster
Bill: boi I hope fem Byleth doesn't look as ridiculous in the englightened one class as Male Byleth.
Bill: Oh, so I realized the other day Byleth spends their entire life pre the monastery working for their father's mercenary group, with no knowledge of the church or politics of the land, and still manages to wear a professor's cloak as daily attire.
Bill: Maybe *that's* what Rhea saw in Byleth.

Bill: Huh. Ingrid has a crest of a noble house that's based in the Alliance.

Nokri (Marisa): dimitri and edelgard's are wrong too
Nokri (Marisa): edelgard's is entirely wrong
Bill: I don't think there are any missing pieces that warp the look though.
Andrew: If only I had the cash
Nokri (Marisa): they gave her a skirt instead of high waisted shorts, the cravat is all wrong, the top is too long, her sleeves are missing the puff at the top and the gold pleats on the shoulder. those are the main issues with edel
Andrew: But making is so much fun
Andrew: Truth but what do you expect from these sites
Bill: How do they have *Jeritz* and not *Seteth*
Andrew: It's like my robin cloak is missing a lot of detail
Andrew: RIP bill
Bill: I mean, I don't wanna be Seteth but.
Bill: It's so weird.
Bill: They are running a 20% off sale for Fire Emblem, but most of that 30 bucks off ends up going to shipping. for Dimitri
Bill: Aww, you can't stack the halloween discount on it.
Andrew: A little out of my range rn
