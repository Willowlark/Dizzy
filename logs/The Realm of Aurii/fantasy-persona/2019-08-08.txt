Bill: I can‚Äôt fight Claude man.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): bl huh
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk what BE or BL means but I read it as:
I'll never be able to play bad ending or boy's love
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Yeah same
Nokri (Marisa): that's it exactly
Nokri (Marisa): i was gonna spend my last activity point on professor training with someone, but i'm 10 points away from another professor level and that'll give me another point on the next free day. hnnnngh
Nokri (Marisa): people are saying teatime with flayne was uncomfortable? whaaat? have they ever tried teatime with manuela
Andrew: level up! the extra action point becomes worth especially if youre bonding with students.
Nokri (Marisa): ye i fed some people, makes more sense to level up since i'll get an extra point next time
Nokri (Marisa): levelling up one point per month seems to be the norm? does it continue like that or is it gonna get harder to level up
Nokri (Marisa): i guess harder because the sword only retains its durability if you rest huh
Andrew: Harder
Andrew: I finished the game with B+
Andrew: or maybe it was A
Andrew: Highest is A+
Nokri (Marisa): what month does the timeskip happen?
Nokri (Marisa): 2?

Nokri (Marisa): gotta buy the bait though
Nokri (Marisa): spends the entire school budget on bait to fish to raise my level
Andrew: yea its the secondaryt shops in that little corner in the back of the market
Nokri (Marisa): i haven't unlocked it yet

Andrew: 
Bill: THATS MY GIRL
Nokri (Marisa): speaking of, leonie sounded like she was ace at her tea party
Bill: Really? I mean, the lines aren‚Äôt that deep in the tea parties imo.
Bill: She is VERY much team mom tho.
Bill: The type whose more about encouraging others than getting a guy herself.
Nokri (Marisa): she was talking about how she wasn't interested in romance and reacted positively when byleth nodded
Nokri (Marisa): *join my house, aesthetic boi*

Andrew: Lets do a Switch party
Andrew: 
Andrew: <@!301927856240459777> have you recruited hilda?
Nokri (Marisa): No it‚Äôs way too soon, I just did the battle against Sylvain‚Äôs brother. The option to recruit her isn‚Äôt there I only got her to C support.
Andrew: Ok I'm still early in my ng+ got her to B but I'm. Still finding conflicting info since we cant interact much with her
Nokri (Marisa): You can only recruit her towards the very end of part one
Nokri (Marisa): Stolen from Biru let‚Äôs go
Nokri (Marisa): dis me
Andrew: will do shortly
Aldus Larian (Jess): Who are these peope
Nokri (Marisa): Your good friends and students of course
Andrew: of course
Nokri (Marisa): If you google fire emblem and their name they‚Äôll show up
Aldus Larian (Jess): Claude is fancy braid man
Dimiri is blonde pretty boi I think?
Andrew: ya
Nokri (Marisa): Yee
Andrew: with sp[agetthi hair
Aldus Larian (Jess): I know 2 things
Andrew: Dos
Andrew: ‰∫å
Nokri (Marisa): nice Chinese
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): People are based on looks only whoops
Nokri (Marisa): This is Hubert discrimination
Aldus Larian (Jess): He look like Snape
Nokri (Marisa): yeah he do
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): People based on pretty girls
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or just girls
Aldus Larian (Jess): Since they are the only ones
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But they're still pretty
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tru
Bill: Claude‚Äôs special class for late game has an epic design. Shame I‚Äôm not talented or good looking cause üòòüëåüèª
Nokri (Marisa): Flashy boi
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do it
Nokri (Marisa): 
Andrew: can she handle that armor
Nokri (Marisa): Yes she passed her test see
Andrew: 
Nokri (Marisa): why hilda so popular
Nokri (Marisa): is it because she's a twintailed tsundere
Aldus Larian (Jess): They're straight dudes
And for me the others looked scawy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ahhh! Nevermind I didn't know she was taundere I switch my answer to Hubert
Nokri (Marisa): WOO!
Nokri (Marisa): hilda is very fashion obsessed and doesn't like to fight or do work
there's an underlying reason for that i think but she gives off a very tsundere vibe
Nokri (Marisa): jgkjyhtgrew he looks so funny in his s support
Nokri (Marisa): bro u ok, your in your 20s but you look 90
Andrew: count dracula
Aldus Larian (Jess): He's how old now?!
Nokri (Marisa): he just has high cheekbones
in part 1 where i am he's 20
Nokri (Marisa): and the time skip is like 5 years or something? so that s rank image he's 25 i think?
Nokri (Marisa): he's burdened by being a milennial
Aldus Larian (Jess): He looks like 50 in the pic up there
Nokri (Marisa): thanks baby boomers
Bill: Hilda isn‚Äôt tsundere. She‚Äôs lazy.
Bill: She‚Äôs also apparently god tier stat wise.
Andrew: She is thats why i need her
Nokri (Marisa): she's also super spoiled and she spent her whole c support patronizing my byleth
are the supports different for male and female byleth?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo this is spicy now
Nokri (Marisa): biru watchin me log on the switch just to find my support with her
Nokri (Marisa): how can i mark as spoiler on mobile
Nokri (Marisa): We two seconds in
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): hilda casually insulting the professor and then walking away <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Byleth about to expell a bitch
Bill: Hilda also very loyal tho. She‚Äôs a good bean, just have to get to know her.
Bill: She‚Äôs probably the second most involved character in cut scenes for the Deer, she supports Claude well.
Nokri (Marisa): because she's his retainer
Nokri (Marisa): some people say lorenz is but he doesn't really act the part
Nokri (Marisa): wait i'm pretty sure i can recruit lorenz. yeah. that means he's not it, and hilda is technically claude's retainer because she can't be recruited ~~except under very specific circumstances~~
Bill: Lorenz is a dick.
Nokri (Marisa): he keeps dropping flowers everywhere
Bill: Andrew || are the Golden Deer portrayed as the ‚Äúheroes‚Äù against Edelgard in the Edelgard route? ||
Bill: I finished a late game chapter in four turns cause Claude sniped the commander. My BOI
Bill: Also not doing it, not making it nor would look good in it.
Andrew: Dont know. I didnt go edel route
Nokri (Marisa): did you not defeat all the other units? :0
Andrew: I opposed her
Andrew: Supposedly hilda was supposed to be the equivalent of Dedue and Hubert as unrecruitable
Andrew: People are saying it may be a big either way
Nokri (Marisa): ^
Andrew: Bug*
Nokri (Marisa): oh i don't think it's a bug
Andrew: Yea I got the 4th route btw
Nokri (Marisa): i have lost items of hers but i can't give them to her because you can't give her items or recruit her until very late
Bill: Does it diverge right after timeskip?
Andrew: Yea its weird
Bill: 4th route?
Andrew: Yea
Bill: Makes sense.
Andrew: I believe only available if you start with BE
Bill: Correct.
Andrew: Yea they treat hilda differently for an unknown reason
Andrew: The divergence is support edel or no
Bill: || Rhea is awol in GD ||
Bill: Andrew you can do spoilers with `||` around the text, do so for Marisa ~~and probably Jess and Tom eventually~~.
Bill: (I‚Äôm guessing you didn‚Äôt know how to do that is all)
Nokri (Marisa): ||she's been making a lot of hints she's against the church, and andru's talked about it before||
Bill: Claude is too.
Bill: Not in the same way, but like his support with Leonie shows him as someone whose doesn‚Äôt specifically believe in Seiros, but believes more in worshipping like, nature.
Nokri (Marisa): i spoke to someone about faith and prayed with them and then literally turned around and told claude "yeah the church is silly"
Bill: Byleth: says anything to get in students pants.
Bill: Deny it if you want it‚Äôs true.
Nokri (Marisa): nooooooo
Andrew: lol
