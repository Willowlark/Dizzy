Nokri (Marisa): I love Bernadetta’s teddy bear
Nokri (Marisa): Can I just spend the rest of free time in her room
Nokri (Marisa): Oh she has a sewing corner too that’s a nice touch
Nokri (Marisa): The back of linhardt’s uniform is so weird. I don’t think he can lift his arms up. It’s like, a capelet that wraps around to the front of his arms.
Bill: > It’s lorenz’s birthday

Nokri (Marisa): THROW HIM A TEA PARTY

Andrew: How dare you Biru he is an student you must cherish and protect and love
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Illuminata is never in her shop 😤 😤 😤
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo if you’re having issues with that, invite them to come adventuring with you and then walk inside their shop and be like “let’s part ways here!”
Then talk to her really quickly before she leaves and she’ll be like “well since we’re in my store, what can I sell you?”
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH! SO SMART
El🆓de Faun (Tom): HOW YOU GET SO SMART
Nokri (Marisa): no u
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So many of my towns folk are so week cuz I've only ever adventures with forte
Nokri (Marisa): I think porco chucks food at the enemy and illuminata uses a watering can as her weapon. Or maybe amber has the watering can
Nokri (Marisa): Xiao Pai trips a lot and Chlorica falls asleep while fighting
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Does the water can and food deal damage?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Bless clorica
Nokri (Marisa): Only if it’s really bad food, and the watering can is kind of useless unless it’s like the final tier godly watering can
Nokri (Marisa): Some people do watering can or fishing pole challenges where they can only use one or the other to get them through the entire game
El🆓de Faun (Tom): WOAH

Bill: 
Bill: Surprised Seteth face
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): I’m so thankful you can turn back time. It took me all three tries to steal stuff from the dark knight because some other units would come and finish me off after he attacked, so I had to get rid of them all first
Bill: I resetted twice before I ever saw Divine Pulse go off.
Bill: If it's not a chapter loss, you don't get divine pulse and I had no idea how to trigger it so I was like I guess I'll do this the old fashion way.
Bill: I lost... Bernie once, because Pegasus Knights got a HUGE buff in this game ~~and my Bernie is RNG screwed~~, Raph because lol armored unit magic resistance is shit... Leonie against that one busted Wind Caller boss...
Nokri (Marisa): o what's divine pulse
Nokri (Marisa): BURNIE
Nokri (Marisa): o the time thing?
Bill: yeah Divine Pulse is the name of the time thing.
Nokri (Marisa): wasn't that one of the first things unlocked though? i never lost in a battle, it was just there from the beginning and sothis explained how to use it
Bill: Afaik you only get it if a character dies that would cause the chapter to end.
Bill: So, Edelgard/Byleth and any essential units.
Nokri (Marisa): naw it was given to byleth in one of the earliest cutscenes, before you choose a house or go to the monastery
Nokri (Marisa): you can use it in battle at any time
Bill: I know you *have* it, I've never seen a way to activate it without Claude or Byleth dying.
Nokri (Marisa): press uhhhh LR or something
Bill: <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Nokri (Marisa): ya
Nokri (Marisa): oh it's ZL
Nokri (Marisa): any time when it's your turn press ZL
Nokri (Marisa): you can go back to any point in the battle you wait, it starts out as 3 times but you can unlock more
Nokri (Marisa): i think i can use it like 5 times in a battle
Nokri (Marisa): if it's getting to the end of a battle i'll use it for the most random stuff, like if i forget to have one guy rally another unit just because it raises support between them
Bill: 
Bill: NeEd
Andrew: Yea i was gonna say Billl you can pulse anytime
Andrew: I had like 12 charges
Andrew: per map
Andrew: Just helps trying to perfect a map
Bill: I rewatch the Seteth Mcdonalds video everytime it's reposted and it doesn't get old ever.
Andrew: Its the faces for me
Nokri (Marisa): byleth: divine pulses them out of the play area
Andrew: Also Bill what are those
Aldus Larian (Jess): cookies
