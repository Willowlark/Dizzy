Bill: That's about it.
Nokri (Marisa): whaaaaaaaaaa
Bill: Never wanted to be the guy with lots of anime figurines.
Bill: Not that they ever appealed to me much.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you mean you *don't* want to display your big tiddy amine waifu figurines posing in lewd positions? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): that's why you put the ones with visible underwear on the lower shelves, so you're less likely to upskirt them
Nokri (Marisa): and cleavage goes on higher shelves
Bill: As a matter of fact I am not into plastic tits, despite looking like I might be!
Bill: https://tenor.com/view/anime-reaction-headsmack-ugh-frustrated-gif-5015289
Nokri (Marisa): but collector's items
Nokri (Marisa): honestly who doesn't want this as the centerpiece to really tie their home together? i think this would look good on your new table
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she has like, 3 difference cleavages
Bill: There's *no way* that a woman would think I'm creep with such a *classy* centerpiece on my kitchen table. Ass facing her, of course.
Nokri (Marisa): oh true, she might feel left out if she only gets one side. gotta find one of those twisty ones in the hawkeye pose so your guests get the best of both worlds and feel really welcome
Bill: Anyway, cause I know you're being sarcastic but these are legitimate fears I have had as a kid so it's a little awkward to joke about.
