Bill: Cool story, remember sonic adventure battle 2? It had two storylines, one starring shadow and the other sonic. Late game thereâ€™s a scene where sonic is almost killed, but barely survived. I couldnâ€™t bring myself to finish the shadow version of that story, where sonic (actually does survive but I didnâ€™t know that at age 10) because itâ€™d betray sonic.
