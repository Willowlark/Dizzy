Bill: Ignatz: “hobbies are healthy”

Never met a cosplayer have you.
Bill: M

D
Bill: Definitely cosplaying Claude. I don’t even care about finishing the game first.
Bill: *hint hint*
Andrew: Finally getting a feel for how the game is
Bill: More persona than fire emblem but.
Andrew: Yea kinda getting that.
Bill: I over levelled a bit to get everyone in the 10+ classes, so I'm doing fairly well. I also unlocked the master classes, all but one are mounted.
Bill: Meg messaged me if I was playing that Tattered World game.
Bill: (Marisa's Meg)
Nokri (Marisa): I’m playing it
Everyone should play it
Nokri (Marisa): It’s very simple at the moment but I like how they fixed the “one item in stock” issue on neopets by having store items be unlimited in stock but only there for like 60 seconds if it’s a really rare item
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh yeaa good idea
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Neopets OOPS THIS ITEM IS SOLD OUT
Nokri (Marisa): It also only lets you buy one item every 60 seconds to prevent people from buying 30 rare items in that one minute
Nokri (Marisa): The games work on mobile omg
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Games?
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah! It’s like neopets do you get money by playing games. They’re simple like minesweeper or memory clones but they’re neat
Nokri (Marisa): omg I think this one is flappy bird
Nokri (Marisa): IT IS
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh no
El🆓de Faun (Tom): For what game?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The switch game?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Am confuse
Nokri (Marisa): tattered world!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): This screams early internet games omg
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Is it old?
Nokri (Marisa): the people at otakon at their booth said it just came out of beta and this was its big public debut. but some people have been on there since like, 2017, and the mods have accounts that are 6 years old
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wooahhh
Nokri (Marisa): https://thetatteredworld.com/
El🆓de Faun (Tom): What's the main gameplay like?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like fighting?
Bill: it's neopets.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~if u sign up, put kawaii as the person who recommended it to you~~

yeah it's a very basic neopets with more quests. play flash games to get money, then go to shops to get items and craft stuff for your avatar or complete quests
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I may take a look see tonight just to try it out
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It browser right
Bill: and mobile.
Nokri (Marisa): yee!

i like all the little references they have. there's an obvious box of swedish fish called finish fish, and i just noticed that mermaid-themed necklaces and decorations are called "gizmos" and "whosits" like in the Part of your World song
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): LMAOOO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I love all those memes
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You take a sippp from your trusty ***gamer girl bathwater***
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO
Andrew: 
Bill: YAAA
Bill: I've been basically stalking bernie and ingrid for two months and I can't get them to jump houses.
Andrew: Try level 15 in preferredstat, c in preffered skill
Andrew: Like for Marianne shes mag and riding, so c in riding and 15 mah
Andrew: Mag*
Bill: grinding Bleh is so hard tho.
Bill: Apparently it's Bylad and Bylass for differentiating M/F Byleth.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~can u be bi?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~plz say yes~~
Bill: uuuuh. I don't know.
Bill: I think I remember seeing something like that.
Nokri (Marisa): Corrin is bi so most likely
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm surprised Corrine is bi honestly knowing japan
Nokri (Marisa): There’s only one person of the same gender you can marry tho, you don’t get to pick anybody
Nokri (Marisa): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ohh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): "I'm the token old man character but also the gay option!"
Bill: ~~it was ransford in Aurii~~
Bill: 
Andrew: 
Andrew: Helly yea expand the borders
Andrew: 
Bill: Marisa??
Bill: EXCUSE ME WHAT
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i knwo its an artstyle choice but
El🆓de Faun (Tom): the left eye looks so outta place
Bill: Teacher going to have WORDS with your father.
Nokri (Marisa): Is this my new cosplay
Bill: Her or Marianne.
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo she has literally everything that’s easy for me to sew
Andrew: Yes is fucked up
El🆓de Faun (Tom): she knows she had to do it to em
Bill: Marianne is more “I’m a useless human being and I’m better off dead because I ruin everything” while Bernie a shut in.
Nokri (Marisa): This is like someone took all the aspects I like of character design and threw them together into one character
Nokri (Marisa): My children now
Nokri (Marisa): I wasn’t gonna buy the game
But maybe
When I get paid
Just for those two
Nokri (Marisa): lol $80 nvm
Andrew: Is only 60
Nokri (Marisa): dem resellers and their taking advantage of limited stock
Andrew: I saw it in best buy yesterday for 60
Nokri (Marisa): does best buy work with amazon prime
Bill: What the fuck Amazon doesn’t even have it directly?
Bill: You have to get via a third party?
Bill: I don’t regret the e shop buy at all.
Bill: What the fuck tho.
Bill: This is super annoying.
Nokri (Marisa): Probably because amazon is sold out
Nokri (Marisa): Most things on amazon are third party even if it’s distributed by amazon, the third party sellers are more like independent sellers
Nokri (Marisa): Fire emblem warriors is only $25 though <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Andrew: Definitely pick 3 houses up but not for juice prices.
Andrew: The game almost doubled Awakenings sales
Andrew: Launch sales*
Bill: Could buy digital? Or would it be that annoying to you?
Bill: *growls in wanting to get Marisa a copy*
Bill: Oops.
Bill: It’ll be there Saturday Mawisa.
Bill: Repayment can be cosplaying it with me and Andrew. 👌
Nokri (Marisa): NOOOO
Nokri (Marisa): Nice joke Biru haha
Nokri (Marisa): Funny
Bill: I originally wanted to get it for you so that it’d be at your house when you got back from the con but I wasn’t sure if you bought it already like Andrew did.
Nokri (Marisa): Funee joke
I pay u back
Bill: When you cosplay Bernie ye.
Nokri (Marisa): If I get a package on Saturday I’m gonna do a backflip out the door and scream
Bill: No you won’t, you hate going outside. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): ~~you got me there~~
I’ll backflip towards the door while screaming
Bill: ❤️
Nokri (Marisa): Pic of Biru and I
Bill: You’re part of fire emblem squad, I feel bad having you missing out on me and Andrew playing.
Nokri (Marisa): I repay u
Bill: By. Cosplaying Bernie.
Nokri (Marisa): Time to get fabric to match y’all’s cosplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): Can't believe marisas gonna cosplay Bernie Sanders
Bill: Oh, and I’ll need to do a photo shoot somewhere for Claude with my actual bow. I can’t bring a bow to a con.
Bill: You can do that for me.
Bill: Find a place by you.
Nokri (Marisa): I begin the hunt for a place north of me where we can shoot with bows immediately
Bill: Oh it can be anywhere in Jersey. What’s important is a place I won’t get in trouble for having a 6 foot bow strung in.
Bill: Someplace out of the way lol.
