Nokri (Marisa): am hearing lots of good things about new rf4 special
new voice acted lines in the japanese, it's really high definition, they fixed some wonky sprites
Nokri (Marisa): also this pun
Nokri (Marisa): Dylas is saying "Forte is looking for a horse? Hmm..."

The options are,
"Can't you return to being a horse?"
"It hasn't been going too well"

but. but it's a pun. it's a great pun. 'uma' is horse and 'umaku' is 'going well'
"**uma** ni modorenai no?"
"**uma**ku ikanakatta"
Nokri (Marisa): 2019 is the year of more horse jokes at dylas
