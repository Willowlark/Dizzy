Aldus Larian (Jess): GLASSES
Aldus Larian (Jess): Finally some representation
Nokri (Marisa): i've never seen this undertale version before it's really well done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVHSozctpK8
El🆓de Faun (Tom): undertale version?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): whats the other one? an ending theme?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): beware the man who speaks in hands
Nokri (Marisa): the original original song is a bgm in touhou, and then fans gave it lyrics and a music video
so the 'original' bad apple is this!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lNZ_Rnr7Jc
El🆓de Faun (Tom): damn touhou has such good music for a shooty pew pew
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH it sure does
El🆓de Faun (Tom): oh the orignal is neet
El🆓de Faun (Tom): blackout 3d models
El🆓de Faun (Tom): or whiteout
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH!!! the transitions are so neat
that's why the undertale one is cool, it preserves the spirit of the original but also adapts it really well to undertale
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yeahh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): very nice
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i like the part where the one girl shoots
El🆓de Faun (Tom): thats neeto
Nokri (Marisa): More Bernie bear pls
Nokri (Marisa): ferdinand cut your hair or at least ponytail it up
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Who is she
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 
Nokri (Marisa): oooooo so the melon thing is a typo! if you plant them, they won't be golden plants like the other 'gold' plants (that are in blue seed bags). when you grow the gold melon seeds they'll actually grow into pink melons, there are no golden melons in rf4. in japanese, the pink melon is called an "otomelon", and "otome" means young woman so it's a pun! they probably translated the description exactly from the japanese
Nokri (Marisa): or maybe that's a throwback to the original text idk
Nokri (Marisa): but it's a pun!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Woahhhh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That is impossible to understand without the typo being fixed and the Japanese knowledge
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But worry as expected
Nokri (Marisa): i looked up オトメロン/otomelon and learned it's based on actual "otome melons" from Nara Prefecture that are specially cultivated melons designed to be eaten by a single person, in opposition to big melons that are too much for a single person
Nokri (Marisa): here's a pair for $100 each
Andrew: High Class
El🆓de Faun (Tom): HIGH CLASS

Bill: <@!141729881779077121> so in blue lions, I have Seteth talking as the representative of the church in cutscenes post skip. In GD there was a generic knight of Seiros to represent the church, even though I had Seteth. Was that the same for you? Cause I thought “knight of Seiros” in GD was dumb
Andrew: I swear I remember seteth in GD.
Andrew: I'll see if I can double check
