Bill: Also seeing differences in... I wanna say maturity levels between Deer and Lions. || I don’t remember the Deer being incredibly torn up up fighting civilian rioters. It was oof, but they took it better than Lions. || THAT SAID, Rhea is a real bitch and a half to send the Lions to quell church desenters IN Farghus.

Bill: Wholesome Dimitri
Bill: Dedue, every conversation: “you know I’m from duscur right? And you should hate me?”
Bill: The script and voice acting in this game is great cause I can *feel* the depression under Dimitri being helpful.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): What's dedue supposed to be? A stray he taught? A tribal? Or a previous bandit maybe?
Bill: He’s from a small country that assassinated the royal family of Farghus (Dimitri’s) so most of Dimitri’s nation hates them. The country was also burned to the group in retaliation.
Bill: Felix: the reason everyone has depression.
Bill: That’s it, that’s the mood.
Bill: Me: why are my units not up to snuff
Also me: *assigns half of them to classes that are opposite of their primary damage stat*
