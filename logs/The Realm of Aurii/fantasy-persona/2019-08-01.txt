Bill: The actual plot of the game
Bill: FYI Andrew Lisythea is a glass cannon.
Bill: I’m so scared.

Bill: I guess there isn’t a two person cap on poaching.
Bill: speaking of buying a switch, the switch light has a discount on preorderss.....
Bill: 👀
Bill: oh never mind, not a discount they're just now available for preorder. 100 bucks less than the original, can't remove the joycons/dock it, smaller screen.
Bill: imo not worth it if you can get the actual switch but.
Bill: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V3G6C1F?ascsubtag=5a4c69813e75bf4cc2292b29ad5aabb0f9138eab&tag=kinjadeals-20
Andrew: Nooe, no cap so far
Andrew: Switch light not worth
Andrew: 
Andrew: Bring it on pretty boy
Bill: IGNATZ AND MARIANNE ARE THE SWEETEST COUPLE EVER HOLY SHIT FUCK MY SHIP PLANS
Bill: > Place strong unit to guard bridge, bring enemies in range of mages/archers
> let strong unit take hits
> strong unit kills everything with counter attacks
Bill: Oops.
Bill: I'm super overleveling my units because they're at level 20 but don't have the skill requirement for class change AT level 20.
Bill: So far Claude and Lisythea are cute (power couple, once she gets over the 'don't treat me like a kid' thing), and Ignatz and Marianne are too pure for this earth. I like Byleth and either Beradetta or Ingrid, but idk. Lorenz is a PoS and Raph is just... hard to imagine in a ship.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121>
Bill: 
Bill: Raphael is an idiot, but a lovable one.
