Bill: She cuter with class change!
Bill: Everyone can be every class if they grind stats enough so. It’s weird having the class tiers at all.
Nokri (Marisa): can she be a yo-yo master
Andrew: Ohh I'm thinking of recruiting her to Eagles
Andrew: 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Anna is just a staple now I guess
Andrew: Shes been in every game except gaiden/echoes
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Even the old ones?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I don't remember her at all
Andrew: 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Huh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Fe1 Anna is best anna
Andrew: I love that chart lol
Bill: I think I’d rather be deploying one less unit than deploying Lorenz.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I guess her being a unit and having a fancy outfit made her really stand out in awakening
Bill: He’s SHIT.
Bill: Also all my level ups are shit and my units keep getting depressed about it.
Bill: Marianne has HUGE Marisa energy and I need to hug her.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: Uuuuggghhhhhh it’s a bitch to get paladins. You need lance at B so your sword users can’t class into a mounted class.
Bill: Wyvern requires axe at B, paladin Lance, and pegs need lance at C.
Bill: I have too much control over character progression and also too little and I’m spending more time planning training than I am playing this game.
Andrew: Yolo, you can optimize on further playthroughs.
Andrew: My FE amiibos can finally gett use again
Bill: Someone’s already cosplaying Sothis.
Bill: Is there still a 20 level cap? Cause promotion doesn’t change your level.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Y'all over here with you fancy new FE and I'm still like "oo good Chrom art!"
Bill: Chrom will always be precious tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good cuz u need this one too
Bill: ~~though glad I didn’t buy a chrom cosplay cause hella cosplaying Claude~~

Assuming he doesn’t then into an axe murderer or some shit
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Morgan drooling all over himself
Aldus Larian (Jess): him baby
Bill: literally.

Bill: ~~accurate tho~~
Andrew: 
Bill: FuCkInG sAvAgE
Andrew: This is me rn
Bill: lol
Bill: Have you cross recruited yet? I kinda want Ingrid from BE.
Andrew: No im not terribly far
Andrew: Im working on Lysithia, Marianne and Ingrid.
Andrew: 
Bill: These kids have issues man.
Andrew: Bernie takes sorry to its extreme.
Bill: I will fight you that Marianne is worse.
Nokri (Marisa): sorry
Bill: No u
Andrew: 
Andrew: someone had to post it
Nokri (Marisa): ya I am sorry <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: “Morale would go down if I was killed” 

Who likes themself that much DAMN
Nokri (Marisa): if you're talking about a student i'd presume morale would go down if anyone was killed
Nokri (Marisa): https://thetatteredworld.com/
Andrew: 
Andrew: 
Bill: Her crit line is “You’re irrelevant” and I love her.
Andrew: Bills new waifu
Bill: **Claude’s
Bill: ~~But I’m down to cosplay him so yeah basically~~
Andrew: Proof Psitive
Bill: “All this stuff is pretty heavy, are you sure you can help me?”
Bill: 
Bill: I love this shit.
Bill: All of Raphael’s supports involve people running away and that’s a mood
Bill: “Do you think your really resourceful cause your POOR”
Bill: Shana is that you?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Art imitates art
