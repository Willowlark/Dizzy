Bill: Nope. Made separately. They've never met either.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): behold the roughest rough sketch of the one outfit. i gotta learn to draw. especially feet.
the colors are just random colors vaguely similar to what they might be in the final thing i just grabbed whatever from the default palette list
pls say what major changes u'd like uwu
im gonna go wander through the house for like 2 minutes before getting bored and coming back
Bill: OWO THAT AWESOME
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): no u
Bill: That's really on point Mawisa.
Bill: This comment is more about my design choice, but I feel like the flannel on the boots doesn't go with any of the rest of the outfit.
Bill: So maybe I need to change that part.
Bill: It's hard to entirely visualize the whole thing.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): it could. i don't think it's too flashy or clashy or anything but entirely up to you. the reference images saved my life.
Bill: *Help me accessories friends*
Bill: OH also, thoughts on knee high rather than thigh high.
Bill: I think it'll look better than way.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): yee i think the knee highs gives a better distance between the holster thing and the leggings
Bill: Ye agreed.
Bill: Maybe even lower, really. Like crew cut.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): l i m b o s o c k s
their heights change based on limbo
Bill: Opinions other people?

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): still hawt
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and LMAO thats sad that thats so true
Erik: hawt kit :/
Bill: Ye, the knee high just is weird, then thigh high don't work, so ankle length it is.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): nokri what
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~Sona predates Nokri~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ankle length or calf length?
Bill: Ankle.
Bill: Like the last one.
Bill: Dunno if there's anything to do with the boots. Or symmetry, I'm not a fashionable person.
Bill: ~~no franken flannels, you know who I'm talking to~~
