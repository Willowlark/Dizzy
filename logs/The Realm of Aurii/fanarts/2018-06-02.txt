Nokri (Marisa): lol rip time for bed
i tried making a sample of what a scene might look like
i plan on doing maybe 3 or 4 poses per character, 4-5 emotions, and around 4 clothes options. maybe. mmaybe less.
if you want a certain pose or clothes for ur character pls share
Nokri (Marisa): art might clash with the background <:rip:369476083248267274>
Afina (Georgia🍀): YESSSSSSS
Nokri (Marisa): i feel like afina needs one of these poses
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: so that's... 12~20 poses times four outfits. 48-80 drawings.
Nokri (Marisa): naw I have bases for the characters. 
that doesn't include special cutscenes but we can cross that bridge later.

maybe 2 base poses, but then draw the arms differently and that gives you more poses.
clothes can be thrown on over the base
expressions are totally separate so they can be copy/pasted on each base

so like 10 drawings total and a bunch of partial scribbles for different clothes/expressions
Nokri (Marisa): i'm using a program called DesignDoll to provide references too so it's easier ~~because men are hard to draw~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): THE SECOND ONE IS SO AFRIN
Aldus (Jess): Wow I can't wait to do the aldus route
Bill: *do*
Afina (Georgia🍀): the afina route is just her finding out youre a lego
