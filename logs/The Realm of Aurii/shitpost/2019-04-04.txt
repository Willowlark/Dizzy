Bill: I saved this just cause it looks like Mag jealous of Erik‚Äôs bellabooty.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
NüÜóri (Marisa): can't believe the first captain america movie had this kind of avengers foreshadowing <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Glonk: this üëè whole üëè time üëè
Elfriede Faun (Tom): A SSNAP
Bill: *I'm about to leave this group stop sending messages*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you can turn off those emails
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): have you ever bbeen to a meetup?
Bill: Nah lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i kinda wanna go to one
Bill: I scrolled through the site a few times, joined a bunch of things, never commit. *The emails are my attempt at guilt tripping myself into doing it*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i went to one like 5 years ago and i met chris there, it was an anime group o3o pretty fun
Bill: Oh nice.
Bill: I didn't find much in anime... Couple of drinking things (most of which are organized by like 60 year olds soooo), couple of photography walk groups, dozens of 'NUDE photoshoot GROUP here (100 dollars up front)... There was a meditation thing in Morristown.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nude
Bill: I'm basically assuming all of these groups are going to be out of our age bracket, unfortunately...
Bill: oh yeah.
Bill: 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): uhhhhh i would be so uncomfortable at that omg
Bill: It *sounds* like a scam to me.
Bill: lots of hiking stuff.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is this Meetup?
Bill: and these, which sometimes get *suggested* to me and I'm like "Hey, they'd tell me to fuck off at the door so could you not?"
Bill: Yeah.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I signed up for those a couple years ago to maybe go to some guitar jam meetups. Never did
Bill: Yeah, never been to a meetup.
Bill: I don't want to go and like, be the 25 year old surrounded by people in their 50's.
Bill: ~~like the sparta camera club~~
Bill: Though, camera club was neat and I should go back.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I signed up my spring semester of my senior year of college and then after graduating I was busy looking for a job and being in a relationship with a clingy single mom so I didn't have the time... <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ugh yeah.
Bill: I can't motivate myself to go when most of these events have a 40~60 age bracket.
Bill: Young people don't use meetup they ???.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they only go to the singles events
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and apparently those are cringe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): according to the people at the anime meetup and also chris
Bill: yeaaaah... while, yes, it'd be nice to *meet someone* on meetup... something about single mixers is just ugh.
Bill: Maybe it's cause I con, but I just expect 30 loser guys who get off on the two women being creeped out by them.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): apparently it's more like a whole group of mixed men and women ... but like.... shallow people
Bill: ~~normies?~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea normies
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): basically
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just re-signed up... there's like... no events... or groups.... local to me
Bill: it's to be expected though. The point of the event is 'find someone to ~~fuck~~ date'.  People going to be shallow there.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you're not wrong
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's a yikes from me dawg
Bill: I'm not saying it's a good thing.
Bill: Just. That it makes sense.
Bill: ~~not like I get anywhere in that scenario anyway~~

Bill: Because the joke a bit hard to follow.
Bill: ,...
Bill: You know. I‚Äôve never matched on this thing and don‚Äôt ever expect to. I only see the new people cause I get one every day in my notifications.
Bill: *do I send the meme*
Aldus Larian (Jess): yes
