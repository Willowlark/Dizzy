Boomer: GAYS ARE EVIL
Nokri (Marisa): what's the word that bugs bunny totally changed the meaning of
i think it was nimrod?
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH bugs would call elmer fudd a nimrod to make fun of him, because nimrod was a mighty hunter, but a lot of people didn't know that. they just knew bugs was insulting him, so nimrod became an insult in american english
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ```In modern American English, the term is often used sarcastically to mean a dimwitted or a stupid person, a usage first recorded in 1932 and popularized by the Looney Tunes cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, who both sarcastically refer to the hunter Elmer Fudd as "nimrod",[38][39] as an ironic connection between "mighty hunter" and "poor little Nimrod", i.e. Fudd.[40]```
