NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): she said the police sent out a letter afterwards but i'm so glad i could see the letter itself
Aldus Larian (Jess): What theeeee <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): apparently there was a big party held there (just minus the furnace for burning metals out of sedated people), and there's a subreddit called r/furnaceparty
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): the person who wrote it was mentally ill and mailed it to hundreds of people
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woah what
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): someone mailed out that letter above, basically stating that all the food you've ever eaten, especially animal meat, is still alive in your body. all the food since you were born is still in there.
the only way to get that food out of you is to go in a furnace and like, melt yourself? or mix yourself with metal? and then you'll be ok. so they're looking for bulldozers to build this giant furnace in a vacant lot in philly. but don't worry, they'll sedate you so it's painless.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's crazy yo
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
Bill: what a girl.
Bill: wow.
