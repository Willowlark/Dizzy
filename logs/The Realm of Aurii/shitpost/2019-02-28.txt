Aldus Larian (Jess): welcome to being led by emotions, where reality doesnt matter and we cry alot!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wonder if i picked taurus if i would've also gotten derse/doom. i just went with gemini as a yolo
Bill: I always enjoy how accurate the generalization feels though.
Bill: They're like "thinks of others before themselves" and I'm like "well thank you I don't compliment myself enough"
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: mood tho.

N🆗ri (Marisa): oh shoot bojo just left and she forgot her phone
N🆗ri (Marisa): F
N🆗ri (Marisa): *what's lepia*
Bill: ` They tend to be introverted, but if you win their trust Derse Dreamers are extremely powerful allies. ` <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I hate that I'm agreeing with this homestuck.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yooo that's a cool sign i found it
Bill: http://hs.hiveswap.com/ezodiac/truesign.php?SC=5&SR=2&AR=7 The Aspect seems like a crap shoot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): light aspect is cool
Bill: `At their best, the Light-bound are resourceful and driven. At their worst they can be fussy, pedantic, and insensitive.` I'll give you this. Idk I just don't consider myself driven by knowledge.
N🆗ri (Marisa): who's a light player in homestuck canon? rose. uhhh. vriska and aranea? yeahh
N🆗ri (Marisa): take the "knowledge" thing very loosely because vriska absolutely wrecked everything in homestuck rather than quest for knowledge
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg they almost got someone to say vriska at the oscars that was a wild ride
Bill: *A fuck up? That sounds like me*
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah that was tavros

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i'm an extrovert in a land of introverts apparently~~
Bill: You have Georgia.
Bill: She's enough for the rest of us.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): good point
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😮 whoa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): For these types of things I usually get placed with the introverts, but I'm more of an ambivert. I like being by myself but around people. Or being more outgoing but only with people I'm comfortable with
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea me too
Bill: same.
Bill: Compare interactions in large groups like BNE or the RWBY shoot groups versus something like here.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but i feel like alot of introverts are like that
Bill: I prefer my people around me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): the connotation of "introvert" is likely over stereotyped
Bill: ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i used to think i was an introvert, but ... i hate being alone. i get super anxious if i dont have something to do or people to hang out with or talk to. I'm much more comfortable in large groups. 🤷
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i get really antsy and bored if im on my own too long
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i thrive off of interaction with other people
Bill: I used to like being alone. Then I went learned what the alternative was and now I need people around.
Bill: ~~and I get lonely quickly as it happens~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I've never been like alone alone?
Aldus Larian (Jess): like ive always lived with someone
Aldus Larian (Jess): but I enjoy "alone time"
Aldus Larian (Jess): but sometimes i dont want that at all
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~why are people even lumped into those 2 categories anyway~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): idk its kinda dumb
Aldus Larian (Jess): right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia):
