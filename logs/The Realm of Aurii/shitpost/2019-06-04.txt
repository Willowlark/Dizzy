Bill: Also yes daredevil cosplay it Jess ~~so I’m not Aizawa/Bucky~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): *nervous laughter*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oh did you hear a good joke 5 miles away?
Bill: ~~it was me I’m the joke~~
Bill: But also ye.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You're more than 5 miles awat
Bill: I'm saying the idea of joining is a little more of a joke now... It'd be cool, but the big group isn't worth the effort and it's just me as Defenders so...
Bill: Dave omg.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): dave is our unproblematic fave
Bill: Is this why you are **The Wise ™**  whenever you give advice.
Bill: Dave and me are opposites. Chaos and Order. Insane and Sane. ~~Light and Dark~~
Bill: new charts!
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: I really like the last one.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont even understand that
Bill: It's everyone's score in the category stacked. So for the group, you can see whose contributing most to that category.
Bill: What I *should* do is try to do it column by column so I can sort the larger contributions to the bottom in every column.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but were not contributing to anything
Bill: The numbers contribute to a total.
Bill: I'm doing this for visualization practice more than anything else...
Bill: Since it's a cute, little dataset.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow i thought hyper achiever was a big slice of pie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but it looks about the same as marisas
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho bill youre like 25% of the pie in some spots
Bill: Yes I'm a hot mess apparently.
Bill: I forgot this one.
Bill: The group leans Pleaser.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow pretty close margins tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): all these charts making this seem like some sort of competition
Bill: If it is, you don't want to be winning...
Andrew: Whut this
N👌kri (Marisa): a fight for high score
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont win any category
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): big sad
Bill: A quiz online.
Bill: Might trigger you.
Andrew: Probably
N👌kri (Marisa): were you hurt by a quiz in the past
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it says basically what your most self-detrimental traits
Andrew: All of them for me
Aldus Larian (Jess): its a self analyzation tool, i just dont think its meant to really be compared to others i guess
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye that
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea its a self help tool
Bill: It's about the negative ways you deal with things.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think its less deal with and more ingrained behaviors
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like mine makes me "dependent on constant performance and achievement"
Bill: ~~and Marisa is the one sayin high score, I'm doing data analytics cause it billable rn~~
Bill: and mine (one of three top scorers) can make `Others feel frustrated, helpless, or guilty that they can’t put more than a temporary BandAid on the Victim’s pain.`.
N👌kri (Marisa): you wrote high score on the one chart that's why i gotta win
Bill: true I did.
Bill: I just misread "Hyper Vigilant" as "Hyper Violent" on one of Marisa's charts and got VERY confused.
N👌kri (Marisa): it's true i am incredibly violent
Bill: *laughter*
N👌kri (Marisa): did you all see my sister
Bill: ye
N👌kri (Marisa): she used to do roller derby <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

Kaio Vermino (Lee): vernal
Bill: Those are two separate things, Ginny cosplayed Nyan Cat.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): butch energy, perfect for derby
N👌kri (Marisa): perfect
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~bold of to assume tom cares~~
Bill: I never assume anyone cares.
Bill: I think I'm out of ways to view data. I'm sinking into thinking about how to determine correlation in categories but that's a different vein of problem and after my 4:00 meeting I'm going home.
Bill: ~~now to forget the victim category exists cause I hate everything about it and am 9.4/10 that and that's a bad cycle~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah fam 2019 is the year of recognizing your problematic behaviors and then changing those behaviors ✨
Bill: Ahaha but then if I acknowledge it I’ll realize I’m the kind of person I hate.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): thats the point. fix it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ☝
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You are who you choose to be
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): To say you only experience your emotions and thoughts, without an ability to control them, isn’t true
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s considering yourself a victim to whatever your emotions are, rather than the person experiencing them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s what they told me in therapy <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof, Iron Giant would be a great cosplay for me if I had the patience for that build
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo yea
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Soopur man
