Bill: what even *are* these questions.
N🆗ri (Marisa): probing questions <:pew:543202259085950996>

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Surprising
Bill: Finally *something* I relate to
N🆗ri (Marisa): O that’s surprising I thought I was more conservative
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought I was more economically conservative but they didn’t ask many questions about taxation
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye!!!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Whoa Marisa we’re so close
N🆗ri (Marisa): We’re Ghandi
Bill: That's...
Bill: Also surprising.
N🆗ri (Marisa): They are missing a lot of questions about stuffs
Bill: Most of those questions were bait for people with strong opinions on hot topics.
Bill: It's not a good quiz by any means.
Bill: Chart cool though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Gotta find a new quiz then
Bill: It's... fairly accurate I guess though?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Emotional intelligence quiz oooo
Can’t wait to fail
https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/quizzes/ei_quiz
Bill: idk.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yeah i wish there were no opinion on alot of these
Bill: I call bullshit on the emotional intelligence book, I've literally read books on this research I shouldn't be this bad at it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): This kind of sucks because it tells you the answer after each one
N🆗ri (Marisa): This the the face of “what, no hug for me?” creepy con guy
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is the girl roasting creepy dude afterwards to her friend group
Bill: that's it you got it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): There was like a sting of questions that I was slamming strongly disagree for like every one
Bill: Yeaa...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Thought I was more conservative as well but I guess not?
Bill: to be conservative on this quiz you'd have to be like "kill all immigrants".
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe liberal is the new conservative
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm super idealistic when it comes to this shit tho and I know it
Bill: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/political-compass this quiz is on know your meme so it basically invalid.
Bill: https://8values.github.io/ we can do this one again!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): i thought i was more conservative too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): but here we are
N🆗ri (Marisa): Meme compass
N🆗ri (Marisa): What if our eight stuff is all different
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo wait I don’t remember that one :0
Bill: 
Bill: I’m a liberal now?
Bill: Where’s my pot.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): i mean most people in our friend group, while dipping into the conservative side for religious reasons or business/gov structure reasons
still are very liberal in terms of social
Elfriede Faun (Tom): (or you can be like jess's parents and just being straight up liberal in every single thing but say they are republican cuz they decided they are)
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaaa... It's annoying af
Bill: Yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Doubt.jpg
Bill: I find our circles aren’t strongly biased on the economic axis, leaning liberal socially if not actually liberal.
Bill: Probably because the majority are students/not home owners in career jobs etc.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sounds about right, comrade
N🆗ri (Marisa): Also big business is a thieving soulless blight upon the land
Bill: I don’t call myself anything though, cause 9/10 it’s cause I don’t care about what other people are doing.
Bill: *so they tell me*
