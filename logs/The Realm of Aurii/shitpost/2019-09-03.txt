Bill: Reading book on enneagram: 2,3,4 types are feeling, 4,5,6 are thinking, 7,8,9 are instinctive.
Bill: If you remember which you were.
Bill: https://cologne.hawthorne.co/the-best-cologne/?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=YN_PS_M_2154&utm_medium=cpc&fbclid=IwAR0bmbVx4c4ujvJ2WMQglEkrJd71tS2AcJqelmAdP3KYybCIHZiEB791_FM Here's a quick that gives you the cologne you should buy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Too bad Tom can't take it
Bill: It also gives you deodorent and shampoos too!
Aldus Larian (Jess): One of the questions is alchohol of choice tho
Bill: oh tru lol
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): I got Citrus and Woody and Fresh and Aquatic
Bill: Part of me wants to buy it, but it's expensive as fuck and I don't actually go out that much.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seems like a marketing ploy to me
Bill: but I'd (apparently) smell good <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I ain't buying something scent based for that much if I can even smell it
Bill: True, I have a handful already I should use.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Now if they offered you a sample of it then sure but
Bill: They'll take it back or exchange it. 100% guarantee.
Glonk: What's the price
Bill: What I do have probably qualifies as subtle so I could see 'warm and aromatic' being a change.
Bill: 60 for one, 100 for the 'work and play' they recommend.
Glonk: $60 is normal price
Bill: It's still something I wouldn't use much XD
Nokri (Marisa): Buy two weeks of good food instead
Glonk: $60 worth of ramen it is
Nokri (Marisa): $60 of ramen can last you like three months <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): The local food pantry had some really good chips recently. The brand must’ve redone their formula because it used to taste like cardboard and be really thick but it was pretty good the other day
Nokri (Marisa): Mood
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Please
