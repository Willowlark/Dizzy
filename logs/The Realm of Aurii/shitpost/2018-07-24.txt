Bill: https://www.facebook.com/100000659893650/posts/1975255172506460/
Bill: https://youtu.be/RjxIhEUAdxo trigger warning for edgy and childhood dreams shattering.
Bill: For once, Gabels all caps freakout on facebook is justified.
Aldus (Jess): im scared
Bill: It's bad.
Aldus (Jess): ok so
why does raven look like 13?
wheres cyborg?
and why does robin look like 35?
Aldus (Jess): and yea rated E for edge
Bill: Raven: Now a bitch
Robin x Starfire: Naaaaah, Robin x *Raven*
Bill: At least Starfire didn't talk.
Aldus (Jess): welp thats cuz she is 13 and robin is 28
Aldus (Jess): starfire and bb didnt even get time in the trailer really it was all edge boi and girl
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): seriously
Bill: Because Starfire's existence is a mistake, and Beast Boy is going to get shafted because edge doesn't need comedic relief.
Bill: just *More edge*.
Aldus (Jess): did see enough of starfire to say yet. what it going to be on? ill probably watch it anyway when it goes to netflix XD
Elfriede (Tom): So the actor is
Elfriede (Tom): Uh
Elfriede (Tom): 14
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao
Aldus (Jess): yea and robins is 28
Aldus (Jess): starfires is 30
Bill: 
Bill: I'm a marvel guy, but I sympathize with all the DC fans.
Aldus (Jess): and BB's is 22 is there a reason raven is so young?
Elfriede (Tom): Oh raven is the Scott pilgrim girl
Aldus (Jess): no? https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7509279/?ref_=tt_cl_t2
Aldus (Jess): she would have been like 5 when scott pilgram came out
Bill: I need to go find a bandaid for this edge cut.
Nokri (Marisa): Kori looks pretty but itâ€™s hard to tell under all the cgi
Whoâ€™s the silvery bird girl
Why they at a circus pls tell me Mad Mod is gonna be in it
Jynx would fit right in with the edge
Nokri (Marisa): I think I saw cyborg for like .2 seconds
Nokri (Marisa): Is the silvery bird nightwing
Nokri (Marisa): I have many questions
Nokri (Marisa): https://youtu.be/wnnCd3haipo
Elfriede (Tom): I didn't mean actually sislly
Elfriede (Tom): She just looks like her in raven
Aldus (Jess): OOO ok
Aldus (Jess): i was confused
Nokri (Marisa): oh the birdgirl is dove i didn't know dove became a girl ~~and it was too dark to see hawk~~
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): *JESS*
Nokri (Marisa): >:0
Nokri (Marisa): why does that emoji exist
Aldus (Jess): i dun know! ðŸ˜®
Nokri (Marisa): it's ok it's not your fault it's discord. we need to write a letter to the ceo of discord.
Bill: You can change that to the unicode people.
Nokri (Marisa): the ceo will know what to do
Nokri (Marisa): we were in the computer lab and class was boring so i made a website in class today it's gorgeous
Bill: Again, Discord has nothing to do with emoji. Unicode is the end all listing of every character a computer can input. They approved the middle finger.
Aldus (Jess): I cant believe discord makes all the emojis ever
Nokri (Marisa): the ceo of discord can disprove it like bigfoot
Nokri (Marisa): pls note that is the *point* emoji not the *bad* emoji
Aldus (Jess): idk what that is but i searched bad and i came up
Nokri (Marisa): i had to zoom out but here's my website. clicking on the button brings up a thank you from the fish and if you hover over the blue the cursor turns into the no sign. copyright 2018 donut steel
Bill: wow, you stole Donut Steel's website?
Bill: Criminal.
Nokri (Marisa): i can't believe biru is a confirmed brony
Nokri (Marisa): biru is donut steel your pony oc
Bill: Oh I'm sorry, you had a typo in there.
Bill: You were telling Steel to nut. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): what
Nokri (Marisa): is that an advanced brony joke i haven't seen past season 5 and the first equestria girls movie
Nokri (Marisa): people started stealing fan ponies from one another and people would start writing "do not steal!!!" under their fan ponies so people started creating ponies called Donut Steel whos talent was finding plagiarized stuff or something
Bill: well. That happened.
Nokri (Marisa): also he's an alicorn because of course he is
Bill: why pasta?
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/SeeMoreMC/videos/2165797297073868/UzpfSTEzNDcxODgwNjI6MTAyMTczNjgyNTExNDIwNTY/
Nokri (Marisa): idk biru you're the brony, but he keeps making pasta puns in this and also his horn keeps changing into a homestuck horn which is a nice touch

Bill: So this is a thing.
Aldus (Jess):
