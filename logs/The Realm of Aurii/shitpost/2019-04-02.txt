Bill: I've deployed code to a server before that has testing hooks on it, where it stops and waits for me to examine it before continuing. Needless to say, the automated server can't handle that.

Bill: Logitech likes stuff like that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but the concept is really cool
Bill: Is neat. They have software to use one receivers for multiple device too.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye I had my keyboard and old mouse hooked up to the same receiver. Now my new mouse I just connect via bluetooth
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): my mouse is a racecar
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, did you know you can connect your mouse to your phone via bluetooth and use it for your phone? because I found that out when I got my new mouse and it blew my fucking mind
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wanted to see if it would work and it did. Cursor pops up after it connects and you can scroll and click as if it was a tiny computer
