Bill: What the fuck is, was I trying to be Jumin four years ago or something?
Bill: ~~there’s no context, asides from cringe what even was that about, I don’t even know~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬 😬 😬 😬 😬
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof
Bill: It was probably around when I met Kellner... she wasn’t even on Facebook why was I sharing that...
Bill: Eh. There was nothing good about that whole year and a half or so.
Bill: Oh uh. That’s not a screen cap, just to be clear. Some meme.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Believe me, I've looked through actual conversations I've had with girls and was like what the actual fuck
Bill: Haha. I uh. Deleted every log, message, and conversation with Kellner.
Bill: It... bad time.
Bill: ~~I feel so V like right now especially with the icon~~
Bill: Mostly cause anytime I said “this is an unhealthy relationship for me” and tried to let it go I’d go find the deleted number from my phone backups in a week or two. If you think I’m a mess now... that was worse.
Bill: Haha.
Bill: Anyway. Tmi. Just thinking.
