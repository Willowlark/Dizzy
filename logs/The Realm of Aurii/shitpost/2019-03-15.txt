N🆗ri (Marisa): omg i forgot about these subreddits

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Greg is here
N🆗ri (Marisa): help he is here
N🆗ri (Marisa): HGSTUHUS 4848419 THE KING COME DOWN
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It.. won't let me react anymore
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I didn't know there was a limit
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm sorry
sorry you had to find out this way
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's rough buddy
Bill: Mood
Glonk: Word
Bill: Fun tidbit from work yesterday:

Life is 30 percent getting screwed up by your childhood
30 percent trying to get past those screw ups
30 percent screwing up your children 
And 5 percent watching the cycle repeat
Aldus Larian (Jess): What if you don't have kids
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whats the other 5
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea that too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Drinking
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ok back to jess' question
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): what if you dont have kids
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Pet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and if not...
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can't have pets 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): uh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pets only live like 12 years though and dont get easily screwed up
Bill: I think the getting over your childhood trauma just extends.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): cosplay
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh mood bill
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yyou right
Bill: Screwing up your own children is cathartic apparently.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "look mom! no serotonin!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Guess I better find me some childhood trauma
Bill: ~~girl you have childhood trauma~~
Bill: Everyone does.
Bill: Unless you somehow never got bullied ever.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye but not like alot like other people have it aloooot worse
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My childhood trauma manifests in my need to do things perfect and be able to understand things instantly as a result of striving for really good grades
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): .....mood
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm just saying I don't think I have 60% of my life's worth 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean thats good though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i hope most people don't have trauma that bad
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like fucking yikes
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
Bill: It's the subconscious stuff like Erik said.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I know
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I feel like you could probably include bad habits in there for childhood trauma. Like maybe it wasn't anything terrible, but if someone pokes any insecurity from childhood and you snap about it.
Bill: yeee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Does someone wanna spark up a nature vs nurture debate at 9:30 in the morning
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm all for mostly nuture.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think it’s mostly nurture but with the infinite complexity of DNA I wouldn’t be surprised if it was like 1-5% nature
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye there's definitely some stuff that's nature as has been proven by experiments with twins but most is nurture
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I've developed the Outlook in the last few years that very few people are born bad. Although I understand that certain traits that are sometimes present at birth, like an underdeveloped ability to understand others or empathize
N🆗ri (Marisa): microsoft outlook
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I love how it auto captilized outlook, that was great
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Makes you look official
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh i thought you did that on purpose hehe
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Height is a choice
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA they did those things where like 1 twin was giving love and the other was just given necessities and they grew up to be completely different
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~like lets not even touch the ethics of that~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah, right?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yikes
Bill: ~~isn't that just mystic messenger~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i side with nurture, with a few exceptions like improper brain development that cause certain characteristics
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~nah they were raised in same environment till like age 10 or someshit~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea like some psychological traits people are born with  but we are the sum of our experiences
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats not to say 2 children raised the same wont be different though
N🆗ri (Marisa): orly? there was another experiment where two twins with separate lives that were totally different had like, the same jobs and nearly identical wives with the same name and the same lifestyle
Aldus Larian (Jess): WUT
Aldus Larian (Jess): shiiiit
Bill: This conversation needs to stop until Tom puts on a Konata cosplay and Jess/Marisa cosplay the twins.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~whats that?~~
Bill: https://giphy.com/gifs/kawaii-lucky-star-CJXY6wqOGuuLS
Aldus Larian (Jess): what it this one <@!301927856240459777> ? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twin_Family_Study
N🆗ri (Marisa): one moment
Bill: *No*
Bill: I can't find the clip of the bit they did on differences between twins.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee it wasn't that exact study but a similar one. the one i'm thinking of was done on specific boys back before experiments had legal repercussions
Aldus Larian (Jess): like they were raised separately but ended up similar?
Aldus Larian (Jess): who wants to pay for me to take psych classes for the fun of it
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye they were raised by totally different families (rich and poor) but ended up almost identically, and were identical twins. I can bring my psychology and sociology textbooks to zenkai :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a neat case of little girls who were unrelated but very similar
N🆗ri (Marisa): look up Laura Buxton and her balloon thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH WAIT i thin the study im think off was based on the classification of "touch and care" as a human nessecity
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooooooo ya touch is necessary for people to not be jerks
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats what it was i mixed it up
Aldus Larian (Jess): but that implies that nature plays more of a role <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn this shit interesting
Bill: lol touch.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OO ive seen the baloon thing!
N🆗ri (Marisa): nature is stuff we can't change. touch starvation would be a form of nurture
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
N🆗ri (Marisa): nature is brain stuff and dna and subconscious things
freaky
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Twins studies have been so popular that one 2015 meta-analysis found that researchers had looked at no fewer than 17,800 traits — including depression, cardiovascular disease and gun ownership — involving more than 14.5 million twin pairs over the past 50 years. It concluded that both “nature” (what you’re born with) and “nurture” (what you’ve been exposed to as you age) are nearly equally important for understanding people’s personalities and health: The variation for traits and diseases was, on average, 49 percent attributable to genes and 51 percent to environment"
Bill: me @ marisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg i didn't drink anything all day until like 11pm yesterday and then i just chugged water for 15 minutes with my cat
N🆗ri (Marisa): im perish
