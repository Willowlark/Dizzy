Nokri (Marisa): megumin's powers are real within her world whereas rikka's is a colored contact lens and imagination so i would bet megumin
Nokri (Marisa): but both poses are mighty
Nokri (Marisa): T pose seems more defensive imo whereas the dab has a nice mix of offense and defense, but limits the user's sight. T pose covers more area and shows more dominance but relies on intimidation, whereas with the dab you can also jab someone with an elbow.
Nokri (Marisa): T pose also leaves your back open but with a dab you can somewhat see all around you since your head is lowered
Nokri (Marisa): the dab may be the superior pose in a battle of attrition as well. one's arms would get tired over time in a t-pose but a dab can be done with both arms in turn, so if one arm gets tired it can be easily swapped out and given a rest

Elfriede (Tom): Aghhhh
