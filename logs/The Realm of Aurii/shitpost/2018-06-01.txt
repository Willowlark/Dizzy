Bill: Pinterest, I make cracks about Jumin Han, I don't need images of him.
Aldus (Jess): 😱
Aldus (Jess): i knew you liked him
Bill: Judging off tropes I'm probably closest to him?
Aldus (Jess): hmmm maybe? its hard to say
Bill: ~~It's cause I'm not pretty enough I know~~
Bill: But ye, I think so. Think Seven is too memelord hacker to fit, and V sounds like he's a fucking mess.
Aldus (Jess): V is so nice to the point where its fucked up his whole life and hes just htat burning house dog meme
Aldus (Jess): also he says "im sorry" like every .5 seconds
Bill: Yeah, I'm not *that* nice.
Aldus (Jess): your like jumin with some yoosung and dash of seven
Bill: ~~oh great, Yoosung, the one everyone hates~~
Aldus (Jess): no silly rikas the one everyone hates!
Bill: *the real people*
Aldus (Jess): nah yoosung fans go hard for their boi
Bill: ~~what fans~~
Aldus (Jess): id tell you to search his tumblr tag and find them but uhhhhh... hes very popular for the nsfw stuff
Bill: oh yeah, no, spare me the little boi pron.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's def gay pron
Bill: gay little boi pron.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Or at least him as the sub
Aldus (Jess): yeaaaa most of its not gay (sept when it is with searan or seven) but yea he a bottom
Bill: bleh, ye, nah.
