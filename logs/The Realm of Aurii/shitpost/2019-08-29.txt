Nokri (Marisa): there was this guy they called the Tarrare in France who just had an insatiable appetite. he would eat anything and everything, all the time. he was kicked out of the army for eating all the supplies, and he had an incredible metabolism because he was 100 pounds
Nokri (Marisa): he was at a hospital while doctors examined him i think? and a baby disappeared, it's believed he ate the child but there was no solid proof
