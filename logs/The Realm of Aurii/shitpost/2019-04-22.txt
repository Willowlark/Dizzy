Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmfao
Bill: This meme requires knowledge of two entirely different friend groups of mine <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): based on context clues, I think I understand it lol
Andrew: Holy crap
Andrew: XF
Bill: Wait what
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So it's Earth Day and the lack of Earth-chan cosplayed on my feed is surprising
Bill: Wasn't early day 4/20?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nah its today this year
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nah it's today
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 4/20 is weed day
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't believe everyone's given up on the earth
Bill: I thought weed day was made on earth day.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I honestly don't know where 4/20 originates from. I thought it had to do with the time 4:20
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Earth Day has been 4/22 since 1970
N🆗ri (Marisa): i heard it was originally the number police said to report drug use?
Aldus Larian (Jess): "The most credible story traces 4/20 to Marin County, Calif. In 1971, five students at San Rafael High School would meet at 4:20 p.m. by the campus’ statue of chemist Louis Pasteur to partake. "
Aldus Larian (Jess): Some say “420” is code among police officers for “marijuana smoking in progress.”
N🆗ri (Marisa): like [siren and handcuff noises] "we've got a 420 in progress" and people started basing stuff off of that
ooo
but what a weird time
N🆗ri (Marisa): eyyy
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woah
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Y'all do smart
Elfriede Faun (Tom): With the drug lingo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Earth Day is the 22 cuz it was when the modern environmental movement was born in 1970
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just google stuff babe
Aldus Larian (Jess): i actually know nothing about anything ever
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You know so much
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): SO MUCH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just go directly to Wikipedia
Bill: Everyone here.
Bill: Geniuses.
Aldus Larian (Jess): google search
Bill: That's the secret criteria.
N🆗ri (Marisa): every time i see this meme i freak out because it's the cherry hill public library
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg relly?
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): I'D GO THERE ALL THE TIME IT'S SO SURREAL SEEING IT AS A MEME
Elfriede Faun (Tom): This abomination
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): No one here knows how to park
N🆗ri (Marisa): you didn't even try at all 🌟
Aldus Larian (Jess): Life hack - if you can't back in - dont
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't understand people who back in. I mean, there's *sometimes* when it's probably convenient for the car, but it's so much easier to back out of a space and take off than it is to back in
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hate when I'm behind someone and they go to back in so I have to wait like a minute so they can get in so I can pull around them and just *park*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Right?!
N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw u get new materials for merchandise and also cosplay things
N🆗ri (Marisa): 28 of those messages <:lenny:395307171539189760>
