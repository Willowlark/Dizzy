Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Logged into Discord and got a notification that they deleted light theme (not that it matters to me because I don't use it) but I can't help but think it's an April Fool's joke
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it could be, but like, do enough people use light theme for it to even matter? xD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think Rebecca uses light theme so I'm *very* curious to see her reaction if they temporarily got rid of light theme
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760> 🍿
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~except light theme is still an option~~
Bill: Light themes are trash anyone who uses one is trash.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I'm living for some of these April Fool's gags I'm seeing so far
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woahhh that light theme is terrifying
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Messenger had a dark theme but I hate it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I like messenger's dark theme lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so not sure what to do for buffer image at the beginning of April Fool's post. I made one that was like "swipe for sexy Star Wars cosplay" but idk if I want to use that or just do like a closeup of C-3PO's face
