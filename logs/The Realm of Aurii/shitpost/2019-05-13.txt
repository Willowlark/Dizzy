Aldus Larian (Jess): MARISA NO
Nokri (Marisa): [gets random toothache] death calls me
Nokri (Marisa): he says it's cold
Bill: Team Scar, Team Abandonment Issues, and Team Dead Moms.
Bill: 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we all need those so we can annoy the shit out of eachother
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): please
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 11 way friendship lamps
Bill: 
Bill: *about that*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): damnit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so which one of us is gonna get rich quick?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.amazon.com/Set-Friendship-Lamps-Filimin-Classic/dp/B07NF2Z192
Bill: I'd throw a line in there, but if i was rich enough to waste 170 dollars on weird ass lamps I need to start giving to charity.
Bill: ~~but only 50%~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I lowkey want one ðŸ˜‚
Bill: ~~so whose the 12th you didn't count~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the cost of 12 lamps is about 2 nights at the Kalahari
Bill: ~~I'd rather go to Kalahari~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~but *interactive friendship lamps*~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Who is allison
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's who I didnt count
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Sorry allison if you reading this but who tf are you xD
Bill: ~~I know that's why I was lampshading it~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): SHHH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is how extra my coffee needs to be
Bill: Though I moved that Kalahari Booking to the end of the month. Itâ€™s so rare Kalahari does weekend rate deals I donâ€™t want to not have it.
Bill: Like I considered going for a random Saturday so I could spa and drink, it was 600 just for that.
Bill: That *room*, not the other stuff.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at that point don't even bother with a room?
Bill: Yeah thatâ€™s where I was at. If I went for the spa Iâ€™d leave for home.
Bill: But then I canâ€™t enjoy the hot tub bars and thatâ€™d be a damn shame.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): a day pass for the park is a little over $100 and then whatever your spa treatment of choice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you could have unlimited water park/spa access for under $200 easily
Bill: But need to drive home.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean, you still could. You just couldn't get too wasted
Bill: Bleh. Drinking to the point of feelin GOOD and sobering up enough to drive is horrible.
Bill: Itâ€™s much better to crash while youâ€™re still feeling it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did you work today?
Bill: Me?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Could Lyft to a cheaper nearby hotel ðŸ¤·
Bill: Eh.
Bill: Split said room for Kalahari between four people and itâ€™s cheaper than any hotel in the area.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I thought it was for just you
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I missed life half that convo
Aldus Larian (Jess): I thought you were drinking today
Aldus Larian (Jess): It didn't load ðŸ˜‚
Bill: Oh yeah no.
Bill: To both.
Bill: Nah it would be decidedly better to go with friends. The invites open by me saying it, and I moved to give your firefly people the chance. Itâ€™s a limited time deal though, which is why I booked it for the hell of it.
Bill: I could go myself but thatâ€™d be. Probably pretty lonely.
Bill: I dunno. I like options.
Bill: But Iâ€™m also not volunteering anyone cause yâ€™all have lives besides me.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What weekend was it?
Bill: Last weekend in June.
Bill: Friday 28th and Saturday 29th.
Bill: Donâ€™t worry about it now.
Nokri (Marisa): there are only 6 days in february
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): he's resting after drawing
Nokri (Marisa): there are panels missing <:lenny:395307171539189760>
