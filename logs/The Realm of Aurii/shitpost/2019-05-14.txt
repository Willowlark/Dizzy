Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Jack Leatherman*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what a pen name
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: HA mood.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is depressing because I never once dreamed of being where I am now lmaooooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): og no!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same
Aldus Larian (Jess): D:! NUUU
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then again this was shared by one of my college friends who is a nurse and had actually wanted to be a nurse
Aldus Larian (Jess): not even like a certain aspect? ~~like having such cool friends~~
~~lol~~
Bill: I nailed the CS career, paid off loans, good friends part... I'd have liked a damn girlfriend already but 3/4 isn't bad.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats pretty damn good
Bill: ~~but as a perfectionist I'mma still dissatisfied~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): my standards were always low <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: low standards are good!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same I think
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I honestly never really had a plan for my future
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I just wanted to have a stable life I guess
Bill: You'll always be pleasantly surprised when you surpass them!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Which I think I've achieved?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I kind of live in the moment
Bill: Definitely Tomu. Especially knowing your history, stability is a good goal.
Bill: not good goal... and an understandable want in life.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): gonna get hella depressing for a sec, but i never had a plan because i didnt think id still be around by this age. 

So i guess i surpassed that, so thats good!

Bill: ~~No wonder you and Marisa get along so well~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): GLAD TO HAVE YA
Aldus Larian (Jess): YOU'RE HERE AND WE ARE SO AHPPY FOR IT!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I LOVE YALL SO MUCH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same tho,I only really set short term goals
Bill: All of those things, and try not to cry at work!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üòÇ
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ill try
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YOU TOO MARISA WHEN YOU GET HERE ‚ù§
Bill: I dunno if I was ever really goal driven... To me HS college courses, college, grad school, job hunting... It's just the logical next step.
Bill: Coding is something I can do well, don't hate, and make good money at. It's not like, a passion like Georgia has for Space.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oop I was gonna say something negative but ya know what I'm not gonna
Bill: say it!
Aldus Larian (Jess): About myself
Bill: air it out!
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO
Bill: You'll just dwell on it for the next half hour if you don't.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i don't have any real goals, i don't really care about having a good job or making great money. my only goal is to be comfortable, and have what i need to survive and be able to do stuff with people i love. and im doing that now, but i think i should probably get a new job because this one makes me sad xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): JESS WE LOVE YOU
Aldus Larian (Jess): No I'm not gonna dwell on it I wanna focus on positives
Bill: and if you say it we can bash you over the head with love and affection!
Bill: Gotcha tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we can still do that!
Bill: GOOD POINT
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't want to be bashed üò≠
Dizzy: *<@!184437198865563648> headpats <@!351471675843411978>*
Dizzy: <@!351471675843411978> has been headpatted 3 times.
Bill: !headpat <@!351471675843411978>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I want to focus on the fact I'm not worried about getting evicted anymore. I don't have to wallow in sickness for days because i cant go to the doctor anymore, Im happy everytime I get home from grocery shopping at the sheer fact I was able to get all the food I needed.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like my goals was just "be able to pay all your bills and still have a life"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you're doing amazing
Aldus Larian (Jess): I had others goals but I kinda gave up on them
Bill: That's a totally valid goal though? You improved your scenario.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): One of the groups I was involved in in college had us make S.M.A.R.T. goals and I hated it so much because I don't set goals like ever lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....not gonna lie its comforting that you all mostly dont really have huge goals
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:mood:543191222127296522>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i always think im inferior to everyone for not really caring that much about big future plans
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but like seems pretty normal to just have smaller goals
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): SMART goals are bullshit
Bill: Yeah I mean... I'm just having fun.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ew that stresses me out just looking at it
Bill: My company has us do that.
Bill: ~~we never work on them though~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "How will you know when you've reached it?"
*When I fucking did it??? IDK!*
Bill: What even are big goals? "I'm going to live in Rome by 5 years?" "Start having kids by X age?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "When do you want to get it done?"
*Whenever the fuck it gets done*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah bullshit like that
Bill: Life can't be planned that granularly.
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO life dont work like that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which brings me to the bullshit interview questions "Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Idk, hopefully not in a ditch somewhere*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): god, mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i fucking hate that question
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i always just hesitate for a little too long
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and im sure thats not a good sign for employers, but like dude i dont fucking know
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'd like to be happy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
ugh i hate that question too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I usually say something along the lines of "You know, I'm not really sure. Doing a job I enjoy I guess"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): in my mind I'm really thinking "Not working for you probably"
Bill: ‚ÄúMaking 20% more money than you‚Äôre offering now?‚Äù
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): whether it's because I didn't get the job or because I can't ever see myself working the same job for more than 5 years
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and now I'm thinking about how all of this makes me sound like such an undesireable employee and I'm stressing that I'm never going to get out of this shithole <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im hitting my 5 yr mark in a month and a half
Bill: and getting that sweet sweet extra week vacation.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea XD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ahhhh adulting is scary
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Late to the convo but my goals are usually ‚Äúdo that thing‚Äù and if I can‚Äôt do the thing I‚Äôm gonna do the thing as well as I can
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like school
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That makes them so vague tho oops
Bill: This is fucking freaky.
Bill: 
Bill: It's came to exactly the balance on my gift card (from returns).
Bill: oh wait no it didn't.
Bill: Close but not *exactly*
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): aw lmao
Bill: Das gay.
Nokri (Marisa): Collective goal idea: we all build a really big sandcastle on the beach. One we can walk inside of.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fanservice episode, when
Bill: ~~shouldn‚Äôt you not want to be the fan service?~~
Nokri (Marisa): She‚Äôs not the fan service, she‚Äôs going to ogle the fan service
Nokri (Marisa): All those scantily clad dialogue boxes
Bill: :lenny
Bill: ~~what fan service tho~~
Bill: I mean, if people pick a day I'm in for the beach. I'm not picking though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): welp theres no free weekend for my until like july

Aldus Larian (Jess): i have to figure out other stuff frist
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea lets not worry about it yet, we have all summer
Bill: ye but totally do it.
Bill: Oh ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^absolutely
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~plus its gross and cold right now so its hard to even think about~~
Bill: Reminds me I wanted to see how affordable a beach house would be for a weekend, like an airbnb or weekend rental.
Bill: That would be awesome, if it could be done affordably.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea it would
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): tends to go down in price in september
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): could still be warm then maybe
Bill: last time I went to LBI it was first week of September.
Bill: Wasn't bad.
Nokri (Marisa): My aunt and uncle sold their three properties this year because the entire neighborhood got torn down to make way for a brewery <:rip:369476083248267274> else we could‚Äôve used that
Bill: <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): This touhou group gets really confusing sometimes
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea mairsa is cute!
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!! They‚Äôre talking about Touhou Marisa! Who is also spelled with one S so they‚Äôre fake fans wow
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uea I can't believe they spelt your name wrong
Nokri (Marisa): I was cosplaying Reimu once but had Marisa written on my badge and some dude tried to call me out as a fake fan because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dressed as Reimu, not Marisa.‚Äù <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@301927856240459777>
Nokri (Marisa): IT GOT BETTER
Nokri (Marisa): There are probably better Blakes closer to north jersey
Bill: Not really.
Bill: The only other (not better) Blake I think we had up here was Ethan‚Äôs Casey.
Bill: Blake‚Äôs been a hard sell, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve had a constant Blake.
Nokri (Marisa): Where does webecca live?
Bill: Also I really, genuinely like your Blake. It‚Äôs a good look for you.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): farther than you
Bill: Like even more than Wooby.
Nokri (Marisa): Does she really live that far?
Until I get fat from not moving at all and I become an even worse Blake <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Nokri (Marisa): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: ~~you‚Äôd have to eat *somewhat* normally to get fat~~
Nokri (Marisa): The food I eat is horribly unhealthy and I never leave the house, meaning I never really leave my bed or the couch because there‚Äôs nowhere to move üëç
Bill: ~~you don‚Äôt eat enough~~
Nokri (Marisa): Ive tried exercising but there‚Äôs no room to even do a push-up or whatever
Nokri (Marisa): I eat!
Bill: Eat more.
Nokri (Marisa): Ain‚Äôt got money for that!
Bill: And this is why you won‚Äôt be fat.
Bill: ~~I‚Äôm more worried about the other direction~~
Nokri (Marisa): My weights been goin up I think maybe. It hasn‚Äôt been under 110 in a couple of weeks <:hmm:543194383885926403>

Bill: ~~I weigh 150 pounds more than you. Literally two of you weight less than me    Feed yourself.~~
Bill: FEAST
Nokri (Marisa): The scripture of the ancients
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs pure muscle and snark
Nokri (Marisa): Wait I am under 110 :0 despite eating like 9 candy bars today
Nokri (Marisa): Must be the moon
Nokri (Marisa): Quick time for cosplay before it goes up
Nokri (Marisa): It went up when I stepped on it again my scale must be broken. Times up

Nokri (Marisa): I‚Äôve moved
Glonk: Too late
Bill: I will absolutely doxx Mawisa. >.>
Bill: I mean, her address is *basically* on her party invite so me specifying WHICH apartment isn't even a stretch.
Nokri (Marisa): Townhouse <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Totally okay with me doxxing you I see.
Nokri (Marisa): You think I live in an apartment so the dox can‚Äôt be accurate  <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): I live in the woods now
