Tikur (Kurtis): 
Nokri (Marisa): someone messed up their copy/pasting skills there
Nokri (Marisa): it should be
楽器：がっき (musical instrument)
消火器：しょうかき (fire extinguisher)
Nokri (Marisa): just in case you need to run into a room full of japanese speakers when there's a fire and you're not shouting "I NEED AN INSTRUMENT"
Nokri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh that was me the week leading up to my senior project presentation
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ended up with a big ol' scab right on my cheek <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): Omg I actually did the opposite for a final project
For a public speaking class I was doing a speech on fake scars (some kids had really cool topics like breeding Pokémon for IVs and stuff), and I tried so hard to make my arm skin absolutely pristine so I could slather it in toilet paper, makeup, and fake blood in front of 30 people
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nice
Nokri (Marisa): Life tip; mess up your skin really badly if you have a big speech you didn’t prepare for. People will be more focused on the giant skin damage than on the speech 👌
