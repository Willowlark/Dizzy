Bill: He backed down quick that time.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *I watch hentai for the plot* lmaooooooo
Bill: Priceless. To give him credit he was utterly harmless. But he’d constantly watch lewd shows and say it was for the plot and I couldn’t resist poking holes in it.

Bill: ‘‘Tis a shame, Sarah was pretty cute too.
