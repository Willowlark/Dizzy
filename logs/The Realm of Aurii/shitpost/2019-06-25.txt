Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't know if it's just cuz I didn't see alot of the movies growing up or cuz I've never been there before but I don't really have that much of a desire to go there?

manufactured happiness
Nokri (Marisa): if you die at disney you get a free lifetime pass
Aldus Larian (Jess): But da lines are dumb
Nokri (Marisa): fastpass!
grab a fastpass or two and then you only have to wait in lines for like 2-3 hours
