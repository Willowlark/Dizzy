if anyone new enters BNE
someone ***must*** post this, or a story of your own beautiful creation.
Nokri (Marisa): ```Consciousness consists of psionic wave oscillations of quantum energy. “Quantum” means a refining of the non-local and an unfolding of the ethereal.. Today, science tells us that the essence of nature is will. Chi requires exploration. By flowering, we vibrate. Nothing is impossible. Spacetime is the driver of peace. You and I are travellers of the quantum soup. Turbulence is the antithesis of science. We can no longer afford to live with suffering. Where there is suffering, flow cannot thrive.

By condensing, we reflect. Coherence is the driver of truth. Consciousness consists of chaos-driven reactions of quantum energy. If you have never experienced this vision on a cosmic scale, it can be difficult to believe. Being, look within and unify yourself. It can be difficult to know where to begin. We are in the midst of an archetypal redefining of science that will enable us to access the nexus itself. Reality has always been electrified with dreamweavers whose bodies are opened by flow. Without hope, one cannot self-actualize. Throughout history, humans have been interacting with the cosmos via molecular structures. We are at a crossroads of potentiality and desire. Humankind has nothing to lose. We exist as supercharged electrons. You and I are dreamers of the multiverse. Interconnectedness is the healing of awareness, and of us.```
