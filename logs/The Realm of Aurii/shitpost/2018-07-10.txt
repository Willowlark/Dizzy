Nokri (Marisa): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): that doesnt look like a bad suit tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): the fur on the sides of the face is a little long but its not BAD
Aldus (Jess): Na that's the new expensive suit not the shitty one
Nokri (Marisa): ye i think he got her a second fursuit and then filmed the video with the new one maybe
Elfriede (Tom): yeah even i glaezed over the parenthesis
Nokri (Marisa): oo in the video apparently they tear apart the first one
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 550 is pretty cheap for a full suit
Afina (Georgia🍀): is it just the head and paws?
Nokri (Marisa): naw it was the full suit but it apparently sucked
I didn't listen with audio but I think they paid $750? that price popped up on screen in big red font
Nokri (Marisa): ~~you can make a fursuit for way cheaper~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~omg im really baring my past of dating a furry here~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): a good head, like REAL GOOD, is prob 250
Nokri (Marisa): ~~omg georgia dated a furry~~
Nokri (Marisa): does that come with movable joints
Afina (Georgia🍀): the mouth? ye
Nokri (Marisa): i made furry legs before for some costumes. the feet were dirt cheap to make, i put them together out of stuff i had around the house, and the legs were difficult to pattern but also not horribly expensive. maybe it's all the time that goes into custom ones
Nokri (Marisa): ooo nice
