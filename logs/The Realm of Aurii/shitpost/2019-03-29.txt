Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol probably
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you're more cautious where I'm more cheerful and honestly that sounds about right
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea thats accurate AF
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the cautious part is probably what fucked you for compatibility probability xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im sure it did, fuck me up i guess

Elfriede Faun (Tom): ACTIVITY?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WHAT
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): I don't do things
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Which is true ;-;
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I've never even heard of that for a personality test lmao
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Yeah, it's basically like being an introvert
Aldus Larian (Jess): it means your ability "to act"
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): not like how much you get out and do stuff
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): I act to stay at home
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had to laugh because there was a question that said "I don't mind spending my time and money to pursue my interests"

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ♍<:pew:543202259085950996>
Glonk: We're slowly taking over, all according to plan
Aldus Larian (Jess): we have 3 leos, 3 virgos, 3 geminis and a cancer
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Eyyyyy
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Time to remove the cancer
Bill: Whose cancer.
Aldus Larian (Jess): although marisa is in a weird grey are between Taurus and Gemini
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is dis true really
Aldus Larian (Jess): kurto!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Time to remove kurto
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😂
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And you don’t see the VIRGOS fighting to be ALPHA
Bill: Fighting implying you have a chance.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because we don't want to be alpha
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:minathink:544567715931750405> <:thinku:543194478614413318> 🤔
Bill: What’s the overlap between all of us. Trait wise.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Geminis are to busy trying to figure out which of thier personalities is the alpha to battle about which one of us is alpha
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Axious monded lmao
Bill: I’d do it but imma stay in bed to see if I can keep from getting sick.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Curious was pretty common
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sociable too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Impressionable too
Bill: Realistic and old school too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): #norush yall
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): kurto is a cancer?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no....i wasnt kidding when i said i only date cancers huh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fucking rip
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ATTACKED
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol XD i thought that when u mentioned it the other day
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im having an existential crisis now
Aldus Larian (Jess): if u tried to get Me, Marisa and Ashe to figure out whos the alpha we'd all just go in a circle of "no you" for hours
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _y u do dis leanna_
Aldus Larian (Jess): it would be like a battle of compliments
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): what does norush mean as a personality trait
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or old school
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not clear, dick stuck in fan
Aldus Larian (Jess): Erik, Dave and Tom would just be like "no this is dumb lets talk about something better"
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i have no idea
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cue me and Leanna’s “Leo’s in a trench coat” idea
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O wow I’ve never dated an earth sign
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm guessing No Rush is like, you take your time and think about doing things before actually doing them?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 1 fire, 2 air, and now 1 water
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And Old School is like, you're an old soul
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which is kind of fitting for Bill since he drinks bourbon like a classy gentleman
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant wait for tom and i to crash and burn as per zodiac tradition
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You’re not supposed to get along with signs adjacent to you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Can’t wait for Aurii Civil War Leo’s VS Virgo’s
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bold of you to assume Virgos would get involved in a war
Glonk: I've already planned out how to win that war
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _gasp_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You’re also supposed to get along well with people one over the adjacent, so for Leo’s that’s Gemini’s and Libra’s
Elfriede Faun (Tom): When I read old school tbh the first thing I think of is Old school RuneScape
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And then you should either really love or hate your antithetical, which is Aquarius for Leo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): FUCK YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): leos and aries for me
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know alot of aries 🤔
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i know zero aquarius'
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sagittarius is across from me i think and capricorn, lots of my frinds are capricorns i think
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My mom and the ex that cheated on me are Aquarius
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Talk about dichotomy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Meg is an aquarius
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Everything is explained
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lissy is a Leo so I guess they’re a situation where opposites attract
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _ya know, if zodiac stuff was real_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Fun to look at tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): if it was real tom and i wouldnt be together <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And sometimes creepy like when someone dates _all one zodiac type_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~called out~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~NOt ON PURPOSE THOUGH~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My adjacents are Libra and Leo
My one over the adjacents are Scorpio and Cancer
My antithetical is Pisces
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I only know like 1 Pisces
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Rebecca*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o H
Aldus Larian (Jess): doin good ya'll
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO oh my god
Bill: Almost everyone here is adjacent to everyone else.
Bill: That’s obviously bullshit.
Bill: Tom you have Angelica on Facebook still? Her birthday on there?
Aldus Larian (Jess): The relationship of Gemini and Virgo can change as the wind, while both partners get lost and found on a daily basis. Their mutual love for Mercury is what binds them 

our love of freddie mercury binds us
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh mood
N🆗ri (Marisa): If only it was gallium you would have been tied together by spoon pranks
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ......~~cancer is moon, leo is sun....im ....bumblebying myself my whole life~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Alright Leanna our relationships are fucked
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fucking RIP 😂
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thanks zodiac
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Leo/Cancer becoming popular up in here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Even if astrologically it’s doomed to fail
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): October 24th <@184437198865563648>
Bill: There goes that track record.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I like the way that one Sprite from magus bride says Angelica
Bill: I probably get bonus points for falling for a girl with the same birthday tho.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wut
Bill: That’s probably some kind of curse for astrology.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah see what their girls happy meal toys are thanks
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Prob something 👻 related
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk bout the glasses but that eyeliner sure is edgy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "i haven't gotten sleep in a literal week, but at least my glasses are transparent enough to show off my massive eyebags"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "I stab shapies into my eyes, thats why i need glasses now"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): are those the clear version of the bee glasses I posted for Leanna? lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes
Bill: Squad top traits.
Bill: ```Marisa     5
Jess       4
Leanna     4
Erik       4
Ashley     3
Bill       3
Dave       2

N🆗ri (Marisa): tom and georgia ur on thin ice i'm giving you double portions
N🆗ri (Marisa): and dave
N🆗ri (Marisa): y'all better watch out or we'll make you go through the training seminar again
Bill: Now the fun part would taking the results from someone who *doesn't* fit in this circle and seeing it they're completely different.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): o.o
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): put it in bne
N🆗ri (Marisa): "*hey bne*"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So if we go to hive mind Marisa

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Does that make her..
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The hive swap
Aldus Larian (Jess): plz no
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow, am I really the only cheerful one
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***HIVESWAP***
N🆗ri (Marisa): hiveswap part 2 when
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sounds like a reality TV show like Wife Swap except where they swap two queen bees to the other's hives
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's pretty much that except homestuck, everyone is confused, and the queen is burning down a low-income city as aesthetic for the background of her selfie
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: 
Bill: Erik and Leanna are most similar.
N🆗ri (Marisa): who's ashley
N🆗ri (Marisa): where's swolfy

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have most in common with Leanna and Dave
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nice <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Or you can appreciate the reverse.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _ahhh why am I there three times_
Bill: Guess you live too far away. :3
Aldus Larian (Jess): What does that have to do with anything
Bill: trait osmosis.
