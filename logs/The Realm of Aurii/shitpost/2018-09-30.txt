and *push* them somewhere else
Elfriede (Tom): Does akko count?

Nokri (Marisa): THERE'S A GOOD REASON WHY AKKO CAN'T USE MAGIC
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): so louise has like, null or zero magic that's mega rare and whatever or something right. i dunno i stopped paying attention two seasons in. BUT AKKO
AKKO IS MAGICAL
Nokri (Marisa): shiny chariot stole akko's magic plain and simple
Nokri (Marisa): diana lost her magic too but because she was from a magic family she worked super duper hard for ages and eventually it came back but akko ain't like that so she didn't know any better
Nokri (Marisa): *akko is a victim*
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): how did this happen
Bill: Akko > Megumin > Louise
Elfriede (Tom): is that why she loves shiny chariot >w>?
