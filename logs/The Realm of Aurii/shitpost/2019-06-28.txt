Aldus Larian (Jess): in relation to previous conversation:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Did the girls come back from Venus with their new penises too?
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😏
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think since I'm a boy, we sent the girls to Jupiter to get more stupider whilst we sent ourselves to Venus to obtain new penises
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You know, because toxic masculinity
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yes the new penises
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ingrained into our malleable child brains
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The girls then also went to China to get a new vagina which doesn't make much sense because China has issues with the female to male population ratio being too high
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think we used to say "girls go to Venus to get more genius"  which makes no sense grammatically
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): huh.... you're right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no wonder we went to Jupiter
