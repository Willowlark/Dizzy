Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the property manager at my apartment complex said that if I'd ever need a repair, someone would be over within a half hour
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa
Aldus Larian (Jess): my uncle takes 12 hours to answer and then tells me to fix it myself <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and when we looked around on Sunday, there was an old lady sitting on her porch (same building I'm in) and she was also saying how good the management and response time is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm very much excited to live there
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): however, I'm nervous about working on cosplay because paint fumes <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo tru
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I know that probably can travel between units so I'm afraid of people filing complaints
Aldus Larian (Jess): do you have a balcony or a desk you should do it on?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I do, but idk if that'll make it worse lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also would have to tarp the shit out of it to avoid overspray
Aldus Larian (Jess): also tru
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could probably take it out towards the street (but that requires warm weather which is drawing to a close)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mercer Street is a "no outlet" street so doing it out over there *could* work as long as there are no cars nearby
Aldus Larian (Jess): hide in bushes and spray paint
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *It is Wed-nes-day, my dudes*
