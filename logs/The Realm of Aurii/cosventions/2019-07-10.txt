Bill: Thanks, both of you. I'm not very good at believing people care about me, but I'll do my damnest. 

This was only supposed to be a mundane complaint about the lack of a thank you and it really snowballed. I just wanted to explain what does help when I vent, since I know you want to and I get frustrated with too much advice. Sometimes more frustrated than if I don't vent at all. Only wanted to help you understand how I tick.
