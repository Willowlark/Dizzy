El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wait are you wearing the furry ears and bows? I'm confuse, you want someone else to wear them?
Nokri (Marisa): I give as payment
El🆓de Faun (Tom): For pictures of you in your cosplay?!
Nokri (Marisa): Ya if someone takes phone pictures of me I give
Nokri (Marisa): I owe u and jess from Otakon also
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OFC just remind us! What cosplay you doin?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): NO YOU DONT
Nokri (Marisa): I DO ITS ON MY ALARM I THINK?
Spinel!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh is that gem? That looks like the robot girl but pink
Nokri (Marisa): I name my alarms stuff I have to remember one day and then never re-name them but I think I have to repay you because it’s on my alarm
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH HER
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): The alarms don’t lie
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OH BOY 5:35 AM
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I CANT WAIT
Nokri (Marisa): Pls warn jess so I don’t scare her as I break in and throw bows everywhere
El🆓de Faun (Tom): She is warned
Nokri (Marisa): And then we can watch mystic messenger plotagons <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): the genderbend bnha group not having concrete plans makes me anxious ;u;
Nokri (Marisa): i thought it was gonna be a group-group, but at the moment we don't have plans to meet up as just our genderbend group?
Nokri (Marisa): aside from the whole-fandom meetups and i think my costume wouldn't be recognizable at that
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Is that for BNE or a Facebook event?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wait I know this that's totally bne shit
Nokri (Marisa): ye, there's a separate discord server we have to discuss it. it seems everyone is just wearing the genderbends to the meetup late friday night but i thought it was gonna be an actual group thing, like the mystic mess is or like every other group cosplay i've been part of
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah usually I would think it would be <:Shooketh_Honda_San:605590718026874901>
Nokri (Marisa): given the conversation right now they don't seem too concerned if i don't do iida with them? but i can't tell hhhhh
Nokri (Marisa): i wouldn't really be able to swim in iida given leg engines
Nokri (Marisa): i was planning on just hovering around them but sounds like they won't all be together
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Well you could swim but you probably couldn't do that fast run for a bit since the mufflers would be moist
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Have you don't a bunch of work on iida?
Nokri (Marisa): now it sounds like rebecca isn't doing denki this con?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): or maybe they're just not doing denki/jirou ships
Nokri (Marisa): i haven't really done much at all aside from wig
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :/
El🆓de Faun (Tom): They aren't making it easy for motivation for the cosplay it sounds like
Nokri (Marisa): yyyea
Nokri (Marisa): i wanna get lee's opinion on what she's doing before doing anything drastic like nixxing swim iida completely, but i'm borderline ~~i'm awful omg~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I mean if there's no group up and it saves money <:Shooketh_Honda_San:605590718026874901>
Nokri (Marisa): the whole point of iida was to be with the group and get a cool genderbend bnha team together but if they're not doing it all at the same time it kind of nulls the point <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
i was gonna use a sukumizu which i already have since that seemed iida-y, i'd just need to ruin a pair of rights and paint the engines and glue them on
Nokri (Marisa): i'd rather do a series i enjoy on my own on friday than be uncomfortable being alone as something that should be in a group. like i wouldn't do jaehee alone, but we have the group!!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I meannnnnn
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Well see what Lee has to say on the matter but
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It sounds like skipping is acceptable
Nokri (Marisa): ye. i don't want to assume anything and i can totally still do it, and i know lee is doing it because they have a fantastic hardcore bakugo swimsuit, but the rest of the group seems very lukewarm
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea if you're not excited for it I'd say skip it and fo something you want to do more. 

It was supposed to be a planned out group with a photographer and everything, which is why I put so much effort into Baku. But it seems like rebecca kinda crapped out on it since she was the one organizing it and everyone and decided to recruit are kinda lukewarm. So basically ita just me. Anna, and mag who are like 100% going full in on it. And I guess rebecca too? Though she doesnt even know when we are meeting up so lmao.....
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I'm personally going Bakugo all day Friday unless for some reason I feel like changing. But that's just cause i put too much effort into bakugo to jot wear it xD but please dont feel obligated to 100% be in the group. You're welcome to cosplay something more exciting for you, dont feel bad either!
Nokri (Marisa): o a thousand blessings
Nokri (Marisa): i might. skip iida if that's alright then? and still feel incredibly guilty hey-o. i'll pack them just in case but i don't wanna drag the group down, and i was only planning on doing iida part of the day anyway, i didn't realize until now that the group somewhat fell apart 😭 
we gotta get you to wear your bakugo again though so i'll look around for someone really rich and we can all do an indoor group pool shoot over the winter 👀
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea dude! Do what makes you happy! 

~~also yes I wish I put this much effort into making his hero suit instead of a bikini but....alas~~
Nokri (Marisa): i photoshoot your bikini if you want!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): :o if you are willing! Sure!
Nokri (Marisa): from the preview pictures you've posted it looks really cool
YEAH if you don't mind my snail's pace turnaround time, 100%
Nokri (Marisa): i think i'm shooting anna and mag's erasermic also
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Take as long as you need, if I'm 80 by the time I get them back that's fine I'll still be just as excited
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): On a somewhat related note, this gives me high hopes that everyone in our Gender Bengers is going to flake out too lmao
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yeaaaaaaaaaa
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I mean... as long as we still do the main ones
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 🤞🏻🤞🏻
Kaio Vermino (Lee): With all the reliable people
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like if it's just you, me, and Georgia, I'll be happy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I'm guessing Anna is still planning on it
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea I wouldnt mind it just being the 3 of us but yea I'm p sure Anna is still on board. Idk about anyone else
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I'll figure that mess out after cce
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just wait until the end of January to check in with everyone's progress <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I think I, too, will forgo "canon" swimsuit Zen. Don't feel like painting *"ZEN"* on the trunks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because then it sort of claims it for that specific character and I couldn't use it for anyone else in the potential future
Nokri (Marisa): Cadmium cosplay was one of the people who voted for Do Not, I think I’ve probably angered anna <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Nah she prob just doesnt want you to kill yourself with more cosplay work to do a week before the con
Bill: Or it was Mag.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Valid point too
Nokri (Marisa): It’s such an easy costume tho it can be made in half a day
I’ve angered Mag somehow <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): Spinel’s halfway done yehaw
Nokri (Marisa): Not sure if I should wear a binder when cosplaying her to keep the gem flatter
Nokri (Marisa): I could finish it in the time it takes for the wig and gem base to dry but I’ll get back to being productive now
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Is spinel a swimsuit cosplay or a full cosplay?
Nokri (Marisa): Full!
Nokri (Marisa): Kitsu is selling capelets like the ones I’m making for $70 apiece, with worse fabric <:woah:543194447345876998> I wasn’t gonna go over $40 apiece, I wonder how well hers sell
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:rise:582318089228648456> <:rise:582318089228648456> <:rise:582318089228648456>
Nokri (Marisa): I could probably wear spinel on Halloween too, kids probably recognize her
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk wear this goes but imma put it here
Bill: Neato
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!351785752197201920> now u can wear a corset to the ren fair just  like all the ladies
Bill: was that something he wanted to do 😂
Nokri (Marisa): Oooo that’s neat
Nokri (Marisa): Equality
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah he was just talking about how there arnt alot of options for guys for like ren faire clothes
Nokri (Marisa): Do guys at the ren faire wear heels? They should that’s period appropriate and if they don’t then the whole faire is a sham
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): heck, I'd wear it to ren faire
Aldus Larian (Jess): they're nice as hell
Aldus Larian (Jess): $300 FUCK
Nokri (Marisa): Make it for way cheaper
Bill: Oof. They nice, and I'd benefit from it probs, but oof.
Bill: Not that I could probably get one.
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://innovacorsetry.com/products/corset-vest
Bill: oh, made to order, I stand corrected.
Aldus Larian (Jess): time to learn how to make corsets
Nokri (Marisa): Is time consuming but not that bad. They’re just very finicky to get the sizing right
Nokri (Marisa): i miss when meg worked at the corset store and would write me messages with the orders every time i got boning from them
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive never done boning
Aldus Larian (Jess): ha lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): am 12
Nokri (Marisa): hi 12 nice to meet you
Nokri (Marisa): in the pictures above it looks like they have the steel in channels already, on the outside of the vest? i wonder if they make custom channels or if they get them pre-made in rolls
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~they sexy as hell why they gotta cost so much~~
Nokri (Marisa): capitalism <:rise:582318089228648456>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like the double layered one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh same
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Other sellers probably have them cheaper tbh
Aldus Larian (Jess): *grabby hands*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I tried searching on Amazon and didn't see anything. Might not be popular enough for cheaper alternatives yet. But I didn't search extensively so who knows
Nokri (Marisa): materials for it would cost under $50
Bill: That means labor charge is 200.
Bill: For someone capable.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OO yeah thos look amazing
