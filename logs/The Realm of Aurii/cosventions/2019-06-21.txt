Aldus Larian (Jess): Where the friggity frag are these tickets y'all
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Idk... I just asked in the Facebook group if anyone's gotten them. Otherwise I'm just gonna do what Marisa suggested
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm someone replied and just said take confirmation email to will call because we need to get a wristband
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok so this is gonna sounds dumb af but I have no idea what a will call is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Basically when you pre order tickets and you pick them up at the venue I think is what will call technically is
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo I thought she said it was at the mall and I was confuse
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought she did too. There might be will call at the mall? I'll have to do some research
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Damn this is crazy hard to find the tickets wtfff
Aldus Larian (Jess): They just never sent them
Like we have confirmation emails bit no tockets
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): http://support.fireflyfestival.com/support/solutions/articles/25000018416-where-is-will-call-and-when-is-it-open-
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Will call is at Dover Mall
Aldus Larian (Jess): OHH ok well that's kinda shitty
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which is like right next to the speedway
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo ok I still don't understand how you just don't send people tickets. The email isn't the ticket is it?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you'll probably give the confirmation number and they'll give you a day-pass wristband that gets scanned when you enter the festival
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): **Things to Bring:**
â€¢    ID and credit/debit card *(might need the card you paid with and inside the festival most, if not all, stands use Square card readers rather than dealing with cash)*
â€¢    Sun block
â€¢    Sun glasses
â€¢    EMPTY water bottle *(canâ€™t take outside food or drinks in. First stop once we get in will be water stations to fill up)*
â€¢    HAND SANITIZER AND POSSIBLY SOME TOILET PAPER *(itâ€™s all port-a-potties and they usually do a good job keeping up with cleaning and re-stocking, but you never know)*
â€¢    Portable phone charger *(or at least the USB cable. There are 2 USB ports in the locker I rented that can be used)*
â€¢    Rain jacket *(supposed to be nice weather, but you never know. Canâ€™t bring umbrellas)*
â€¢    Shoes that will be comfortable and you donâ€™t mind getting dirty *(Iâ€™m imagining itâ€™s gonna be a pretty mucky mess in some areas because of all this rain)*
â€¢    Positive attitude
â€¢    Sense of fun
