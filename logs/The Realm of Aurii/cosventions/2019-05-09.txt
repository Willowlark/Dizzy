Bill: Your Mina pick seems to have gotten a lot of attention <@!351471675843411978> .
Bill: People liked it on Facebook, retweeted it on twitter, and it got reposted on Instagram.
Bill: Facebook doesn’t usually get attention, and Twitter maybe a retweet from Gen... but it was new people this time.
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/13010917/android/sticker.png;compress=true
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh wow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): A U D R E Y
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): *** A U D R E Y***
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I would be tempted goddamn
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 😯 😮
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): except light and dark lux are the only cool ones oops
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BUT SHE NEEDS A LUX
Bill: Audrey doesn’t have a great track record of sticking to cosplays. Just keep that in mind.
Bill: But yes light and dark lux are best.
Bill: Just do the new one though. She cute.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg i'm still reeling over the mipha shoot where she showed up in kyoko without any warning
N🆗ri (Marisa): surprise!
Bill: ~~or normal lux that you’ve been saying you’ll do for a year~~
Bill: Yeaaaaah it was her first private shoot I wouldn’t hold it against her.
Bill: But she tossed all her cosplays for Zenkai to do KDA all weekend.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she shall learn 🌟
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone mentioned having cosplay 'types' earlier, like characters that people always cosplay. i think it was leanna who mentioned it? <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
but that's got me thinkin
do you guys have types
i know i have one but i can't pinpoint what it is
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia -> strong independent women?
Bill: Georgia’s type is strong independent women, often red heads. Usually bubbly or happy.
Bill: Jess doesn’t want to be typecast so she’s got a good spread.
Bill: Tom cosplays a lot of emotionless bois.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): but a lot of georgia's stuff is also blonde
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): strong and spunky redheads and blondes
Bill: It’s not a constant. But she has a rep for it.
Bill: Marisa.... you cosplay so wide spread it’s hard. If anything I would say like... idoly? Classic anime? With the big smiles and the moe traits?
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw not idols or classics <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
i gotta look at my list. and maybe separate made costumes from bought costumes because sometimes i'll just buy costumes that are insanely cheap
Bill: The most obvious type cast in this group is “who you cosplay from rwby” cause it’s the biggest overlap.
N🆗ri (Marisa): all except one idol costume is bought and the one that's made isn't from an idol anime <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): o. i cosplay 4 rwby characters rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): but so does georgia? or at least 3
Bill: Georgia cosplays three, so?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i have cosplayed 6 tho AHAAAAA kill me
N🆗ri (Marisa): ruby, pyrrha, neon, and blake are rather different from each other
N🆗ri (Marisa): EYYY
Bill: You don’t cosplay rwby frequently enough to be type cast. Do a group rwby with everyone and come to the shoot, people will start to recognize you as a character.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yang, weiss, pyrrha are normal rotation, ive done sun, jaune, and blek before
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tru facts
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't want to be recognized as a character though, isn't that what everyone was saying was bad to do
Dizzy: *<@!184437198865563648> is now irl Ruby*
N🆗ri (Marisa): !irlRuby <@!184437198865563648>
Bill: You did Blake once Georgia.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah but i still DID it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Dizzy: *<@!301927856240459777> is now irl Ruby*
Bill: !irlRuby <@!301927856240459777>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i opened what i thought was my cosplay list but it was my resume oops
Bill: No one but me will ever remember it lol, you won’t get type cast as Blake.
Bill: Same difference?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you mean thats not what i submit for physics jobs
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): darn i knew something was wrong
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think its more so which characters your gravitated towards
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not which ones you necesarily have cosplayed
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee that's what i'm trying to figure out
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): , cause we all have done a variety
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its just theres certain ones you just connect with more than others
Bill: Marisa’s got one, it’s just hard to pin down.
Bill: I can only describe it as classic anime girl.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my list of cosplays is 3 pages single spaced so i'm going through it to see
i figure if i sort out the ones i bought for cheapness i might find a pattern
Bill: I will find out the big secret in the morning.
N🆗ri (Marisa): crunch time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): marisas characters: straight across bangs
N🆗ri (Marisa): vaguely tru
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i just went through your insta and like 80% of the have blunt bangs xD~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): *it's all i've ever known*
N🆗ri (Marisa): yet i still can't cut them straight <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): also mostly happy/sassy characters
N🆗ri (Marisa): how can i mark stuff in word without color coding it
bold? is that noticable
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea bold is noticable
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh snap i forgot i could do ai's school uniform now that i have mirai's costume
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ***bold***
N🆗ri (Marisa): all i've learned from this is that i bought too many costumes in japan
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318> non-sporty genki characters with a penchant for self discovery and occasional tragic pasts/bangs?
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait i haven't updated that since the year started i forgot stuff like terra and emma
N🆗ri (Marisa): "non-sporty genki characters with a penchant for self discovery and occasional tragic pasts/bangs"
<:thinku:543194478614413318> i thiiiiiiink it's up to date now maybe
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): whats genki
N🆗ri (Marisa): like spirited/happy-go-lucky energetic types <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo suddenly two new promising looking manga appear

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wanna wear more Yang
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m on a yang spree
Bill: There doesn’t need to be a server for every cosplay group Rebecca...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've already gotten to the point of muting the Avengers one
Bill: Avengers only needed one cause a lot of people were joining from out of BNE.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof Sorry Erik xD we talk a LOT in the avengers one. I didnt intend for it to get annoying. ~~at least we're mostly talking about the group though~~
Bill: Also you @'d me, I still have the group on mute till tomorrow.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I @ed you to help with the character sheet page, sorry
Bill: no need to apologize, I'm just not going to scroll through the chat to make updates. What do I need to change/add?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They are all in the character page but it looks nicer and easier to read in the tables you made ... you also forgot me as cap xD
Bill: that the only change need to be made?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea that's it, just new characters added and me
Bill: Were there any newbies?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Bill: Ant man in what, avenger 2.0?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea 2.0
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Scarlet witch and quicksilver too
Bill: Done.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Thank you! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: nbd.
Bill: I was just ghosting the server. ~~not so much spoilers but cause I was ghosting everything recently but~~
Bill: Now I'mma just wait till we see the movie.
Bill: What about "Hawkeyeing America's Ass?"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Thats totally valid, no worries. I just figured youd rather me tag you instead of just talk about you like you were there.

And Shannon wanted to do cap America but realized there already was one and came into the channel like " Hawkeye might not have caps ass but I can still ogle at it"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And thus hawkeying Americas ass was born
Bill: So... is she Hawkeye?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yes
Bill: Shannon and what's her insta?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Naychansan
Bill: Updated.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Thank you again!
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/13010896/android/sticker.png;compress=true
Bill: *oooohkaaaayyyy*
Bill: At least he commented nice on JUSTIN and not Jess.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nice
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did u guys talk about anything pertaining to me last night, that's alot of.kessages to catch up on and I fell asleep
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They were just talking about how amazing and wonderful you are
Bill: Accurate.
Bill: Also type casting for peoples cosplay.
Bill: Which you don’t have.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sounds fake but ok
Bill: Excuse you.
Bill: More fame.
Bill: Soon I’m going to known as Whoozica’a photographer than Wezrez’s.
Bill: ~~both Ws~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA Ws
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): tilt **W**orm
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): s**w**ende**w**giantcosp**w**ay
Bill: *One of these things is not like the others.*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): **W**ipstickgi**ww**affe
Bill: *Ripstickgiraffe*
Glonk: If you're going to cosplay Thor, <@245270932602486784> , do what this person did with her eyes http://imgur.com/gallery/UgXmMnI
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bill: gaba gaba.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): GOD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OF
Elfriede Faun (Tom): H A M M E R
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHOA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *HOWMST?*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, reflective contacts?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): obviously light source is from helmet, but I'm curious what magic is making the contacts do that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if you click the link
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it explains how she did it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): apparently the contacts are blacklight reactive
Bill: Men on Instagram be like:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): neat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bill don't click
Bill: Dude there’s a endgame spoiler channel.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats not a spoiler though
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s like, a thing thor has been doing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): RAWR THUNDER MAN boom glow eyes
Bill: *i have almost made it two weeks*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): youre doing amazing
Bill: *I have an obsessive need to know everything and spoiler tags are far too tempting*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): when do you see it?
Bill: Tomorrow.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg yes finally
Bill: Good idea would be to lay out the plan for the group long ahead of time. For Katsu, say you're booking a photographer for X hour to do a group shoot on <day>.
Bill: I would say let the subgroups (Avengers, GotG, etc) organize their own mini shoots.
Bill: Set the expectation for the subgroup to be just the one, mega shoot.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm thinking we can do it similar to that huge marvel shoot that happened last week
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think Jammie was planning on just doing fem Tony anyway. No suit <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's at least the vibe I got from her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she like.... wants to do..... fem tony... but like ...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cute
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....tony isnt CUTE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hes a playboy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeaaaah
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): -sighs-
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was really hoping for the suit, guess hindsight says we should’ve been more specific
Bill: ~~build the core group privately before putting things on blast~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we were trying to
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): with BNE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BNE was supposed to be private lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): assuming us SAYING "hey anna wanna do iron man 👀 "
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): was a big enough hint
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee i see now the difference between aurii and bne's privacy
Bill: BNE 👏 is 👏 not 👏 private 👏 :3c
Bill: That said, you can ask if she's doing the suit. If she isn't ask, ask if she minds if you look for someone who is so you can do the full armor set up.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That feels mean
Bill: Don't tell her to leave. Just ask if she's okay with someone doing the alternate version, if she's not intending to it.
Bill: Hell, iron man and tony have one thing in common, the arc reactor. Otherwise every part of the outfit is different.
Bill: But just approach is as you want to know what she's doing.
Bill: Battle or casual.
Bill: and if it's casual, then you have a reason to say 'do you mind', leaving it entirely in her court.
Bill: You're fucked if she says she wants to be the only one tho.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why did we add flakey peeps
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'll ask
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bless Leanna for not giving a fuck
Bill: Start all cosplanning in Aurii, pick your asks from the start, ask them *directly* if they want to join, and once you fill your personal roster then go public.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We’re not organized billiam
Bill: <@!334090409389195266> maybe in DM.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We’re just a ball of poop rollin downhill
Bill: I know you aren't.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Picking up more as we roll
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nah its fine
Bill: kk.
Bill: Asking a question in a public channel does add peer pressure to the equation, which can be good for you but if Jaime feels that pressure it might make her salty.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....i tend to.... not care
Bill: IE the "hey Georgia can I come to thing you were planning privately without all of BNE" messages in BNE.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not to sound like an ass... but 😬
Bill: hmm?
Bill: Am I the ass?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like i just don't really care if its a little peer pressury because she tends to flake
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im the ass
Bill: Oh yeah no I understand it.
Bill: I only wanted to present you the thought of doing a DM.
Bill: It's just a different approach that has you come off a different way.
Bill: Social interaction is a puzzle.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, i gotchu. normally i'd DM
Bill: ~~or manipulation I suppose~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but im not super close with her, and i know she flakes a lot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so im not partial to being private about it
Bill: Ye ye. Jaime is both of those things.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She also probably doesn’t mins
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Knowing Jaune
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean Jaime but ok
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): another thing that's kind of making me feel some type of way is that Hunter comes in and is now offering prop commissions...
Bill: Hunter uses every group he's in to drum up business.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he just wants an excuse to use his printer he bought off his friend, he doesnt mean anything bad by it
Bill: It's not very friendly, but it IS very professional of him.
Bill: but yeah, it's not personal either.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he made me an ozpin cane for free, just because he doesnt know what to do with the printer
Bill: Such is the life of an entrepenuer.
Bill: Huzzah your problem is solved.
Bill: I take my payment in...
Bill: Well.
Bill: I dunno.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): how does my FB page have 1,164 likes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i never use it
YOU BAKA: do you get notifications to keep updating it because i've gotten 3 this month so far
Bill: I get those notifications all the time.
Bill: Because you’re a cute girl probably.
YOU BAKA: I keep getting the “unread notifications” button from the bnha genderbends group but there are no new messages <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: Discord glitching or deletions.
Bill: Hunter and Anna saying I’m a candidate to shoot avenger group and I’m like <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: I’m not volunteering to shoot groups.
Bill: I don’t think I need to say it *Right Now* tho, since it’s half a year away.
Bill: Imma basically free shoot if anything.
Bill: ~~so just Aurii~~
YOU BAKA: I still need ANext photogs aaaaa
Would you be willing to shoot Raphtalia at all?
Bill: Duh.
Bill: I expected to.
Bill: Especially if you AND Andrew are doing shield hero.
Bill: ~~you aren’t booking 30 other photographers without even saying anything to me are you~~
YOU BAKA: andru said it might not be done in time? it's still a month away <:pwease:555585508819075112> 
~~maybe but because i don't wanna bother you with series you don't like~~
YOU BAKA: raphtalia and ranma are confirmed, kagura and manaka are high probables. probably something from haruhi depending on when autographs are.
i forget who else i was gonna do
Bill: *How the hell can you know if I want to shoot it if you don’t ask.*
YOU BAKA: you mentioned before you mainly liked shooting series you were a fan of owo
YOU BAKA: and the test of time has shown that to be true owo
Bill: *and shooting the people I like*
Bill: *And characters that inspire me*
Bill: *Like Raphtalia, whose cute as fuck even if I’d never watch the show*
Bill: <:hmm:543194383885926403>
YOU BAKA: that's your furry talking :3c
Bill: Never mind I won’t shoot you. =T
YOU BAKA: time to browse the facebook classifieds
Bill: ~~I cant even joke about that cause you take things to seriously~~
YOU BAKA: i've already screenshotted it
Nokri (Marisa): and have facebook open
Bill: Waste money on shitty photogs who don’t give you your photos back even after you pay them. =T
Bill: <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Nokri (Marisa): yeah i never got my emma pics back <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): and still waiting on pyrrha from... 3 years ago? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Case. In. Point.
Nokri (Marisa): life is such a gamble
Bill: Don’t make assumptions.
Bill: Anna: “guess we’re shooting avengers in house”
Me: “uggggggh”
Bill: Meanwhile Leanna speakin for me. 😏
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sorry if it was out of my place to do so
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but shes jumping the gun a bit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i need to wrangle her back in
Bill: That fine.
Bill: I would have brought it up eventually, probably when I decided how I DO want to shoot it.
Bill: I don’t mind being the spark for your reprimand.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that group got a bit too chaotic today, so i'm just trying to get it back to where it should be expectation-wise
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....~~and also show that **I** am, in fact, the leader...and not anna~~
Bill: There’s that Leo personality.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😏
Bill: Anna will fall into line, she’s not malicious. Just excited.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea, i know that, but her excitement causes a domino effect
Bill: YuuuuuUUUUPPPPOO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): especially with hunter
Bill: That comments a reassurance you did the right thing not a criticism.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): gotcha xD <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Enthusiasm must be tempered.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): especially THIS soon
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we're not even close to katsu, take it down a notch.... or like 10 notches
Bill: ~~Alpha Leo approves~~
Nokri (Marisa): meulin????
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~Alpha leo high five~~
Nokri (Marisa): i have a meulin shirt are we doing a meulin group
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whats that o3o
Bill: I AM THE ALPHA AND OMEGA
Nokri (Marisa): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SeveralTerribleKagu-size_restricted.gif
Bill: Bible quotes woo.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH HOMESTUCK
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): NO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sdhdsahdl
Nokri (Marisa): alpha and omega has 8 movies
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): excuse me, WHAT
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 8?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shrek:554719881216524310>
Nokri (Marisa): i had to double check but yeah it just kind of happened i guess
Bill: OH FUCKING WO Kirsten asking for a shoot?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😮
Bill: Yo I haven’t shot her since I did with Georgia at LAST animenext.
Bill: And also people. Don’t come to me with shoot requests anymore.
Bill: Course that’s probably my fault but.
Nokri (Marisa): does that include us or
Nokri (Marisa): because you just told me to come to you for shoot requests but now you're saying not to <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): am do a confuse
Bill: *you never came to me with shoots*
Bill: DO SO
Bill: And I’m LAMENTING that people aren’t.
Bill: Not asking makes me SAD.
Bill: Baaaah!
Nokri (Marisa): i always do :0 i'm obsessive about shoots
Nokri (Marisa): i hired randoms after prior rejections, so that's why i keep my eye on them now
Bill: You didn’t ask about raph. Or anything from Animenext.
Bill: I had to force you to shoot Katarina Katsu.
Bill: And Corn.
Nokri (Marisa): i asked you to shoot katarina and corn
i basically forced you at gunpoint for both at the con
Bill: *ExCuSe ME?*
Bill: How dare.
Nokri (Marisa): i only cancelled maki at katsu because it was late and i didn't want to keep everyone up with a shoot when we had to get up early, because it would've taken a while to do makeup and everything
Bill: Lol I forgot about Maki.
Bill: Which case in point I don’t care.
Bill: I forced you at gun point for Katarina cause you were sad about that douchey judges.
Bill: Corn I was cold but I mean. Katsu is suffering.
Nokri (Marisa): i dragged you down from the con room when you were busy with something else
Nokri (Marisa): you were very busy at katsu
Bill: *for Katarina?*
Nokri (Marisa): yeah
Bill: Are you NUTS.
Bill: I was HAPPY to come shoot that.
Nokri (Marisa): you sounded busy on the message group, you were reluctant to come down
Bill: Not in the freaking slightest. The rwby pj party turned into CoH and I was bored out of my skull.
Bill: (Sorry G)
Nokri (Marisa): point is i sell my soul for photoshoots <:lenny:395307171539189760> why else would i hire so many photographers
Nokri (Marisa): what's coh :0
was the rwby pj party at that time????
Nokri (Marisa): i brought a costume for that i thought it was on friday woah
Nokri (Marisa): oh wait
Nokri (Marisa): that was friday <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: No shit which is why I EXPECT you to tell me about things you want to shoot!
Nokri (Marisa): i always post my lineup here
Bill: Check that low self esteem at the door, if I’m not interested I’ll tell you.
Bill: You just said earlier you don’t know your lineup.
Nokri (Marisa): i can't check stuff at the door what if it gets stolen
Bill: You had 5 maybes.
Nokri (Marisa): for other cons and events though
Bill: Ish.
Bill: Because you don’t like. Plan. So much as do whatever anyone asks at any moment until you have 20 cosplays in a weekend.
Nokri (Marisa): my lineup is going to be last minute until i figure out what the schedule is because *some people* tell me to stop making so many costumes owo
Nokri (Marisa): yee
i used to plan very far in advance and knew what i was doing months out but now what if people ask me
Bill: =T
Bill: Imma ban you from reacting.
Bill: *Doubt me girl*
Bill: I’m mad at you for thinking I didn’t want to shoot Katarina and not telling me about your plans cause you think I don’t care about your cosplays. =T
Nokri (Marisa): i think the issue is both of us think the other is unwilling to do photos when the opposite is true
because i remember you said something about me not wanting to do blake photos when i got to kotori, but i 500% wanted to do blake photos and thought you didn't want to shoot it
Bill: No my problem is you disappear until sundown.
Bill: And THEN want photos.
Bill: I just need you to actually say 2-3 imma go take photos with Biru
Nokri (Marisa): did i go somewhere in the morning of the con?
if i disappeared without having something scheduled prior it's because i got the impression you didn't want to do photos
like i think we got there and went to dealers because you mentioned something about it?
Nokri (Marisa): but you don't schedule stuff anymore
Bill: *I do when it’s you cause otherwise you disappear*
Bill: I’m always slow to start shooting.
Bill: Big cons I usually plan something with Georgia in the morning cause I get some enthusiasm from working with her and that kicks me into gear.
Bill: I always need a warm up.
Nokri (Marisa): i thought that said you get some euthanasia and was like "oh"
Bill: Course, you wouldn’t know that before so.
Nokri (Marisa): that might be a reason
every photographer i shot with goes into it immediately because it's a timed shoot
Nokri (Marisa): like, "hi! ok start posing" kind of deal
Bill: Nope. I need a bit of kick into gear when I get out on the floor.
Bill: *but we don’t have a time shoot anyway cause you don’t give me a time*
Bill: =T
Bill: =T
Nokri (Marisa): i can find out the time for raphtalia sometime after may 25th
Elfriede Faun (Tom): thats the fastest signing ive ever seen 100 pics up
Bill: What?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The Homestuck picture
