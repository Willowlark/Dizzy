That’s fine though I can t pose better
N🆗ri (Marisa): T pose and squat
Aldus Larian (Jess): Can u take it in?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’d rather not because this type of fabric is cursed for me, that’s why I bought it as a dress
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t expect it to survive the con I always somehow accidentally shred these clothes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh do you have an idea where your gonna be moving <@245270932602486784> ? Still in the same town so your sisters don't have to change districts?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Come to south jersey it’s great
N🆗ri (Marisa): I was afraid the slit would be too high but Pyrrha’s was way higher and I was allowed in with that so this should have no problems
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Kyoot
N🆗ri (Marisa): Now I gotta learn martial arts again
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oooooo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH WHAT CHARACTER
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that looks so nice
Bill: Very cute Marisa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo nicu
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ranma! Ranma-chan because the formal is 80s themed and that’s an 80e anime. Might do regular ranma before the formal but I’ve worn that to ANext before
N🆗ri (Marisa): No all of u
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I THOUGHT SO

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh no wait she just has the braid things
Elfriede Faun (Tom): No bun things
N🆗ri (Marisa): liek dis
N🆗ri (Marisa): In some art she/he has buns!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ooo okay that would explain my confusion
N🆗ri (Marisa): Rumiko Takahashi liked to give her ranma characters lots of outfits and styles 
Same can’t be said for her other series’ though tho <:rip:369476083248267274>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I’ll be in the same school district!
Bill: Shame. Should move closer.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah closer to south jersey
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀  its like they heard us the other day LMaO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): $120 for three costumes is a steal
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀 👀  ~~they come with wigs too~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i'm tempted~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): is the backpack really a jet pack though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): gotta test that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yo what a steal
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is that girl with the green hair and horns from ranma?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): With the tiger print bikini thing

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Inyuasha too Damn
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The gangs all here
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Was ranma always cursed with the water gender thing or did that happen later?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 51p4HXeiogL.jpg
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hmmm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 120 for three jumpsuits, 3 wigs, and the gloves?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and shoes if were size 8-9
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 2 pairs of shoes are size 8 and one is 9
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): curse my tiny 7 feet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats still such a steal for all those cosplay pieces?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): right?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and they dont look half bad either
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >.> im gonna ask her if she'll do 100 for all 3 and see what shipping cost would come out to
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause thats like 33 dollars per person >.>
N🆗ri (Marisa): THUNDER NYAN NYAN
Ranma wasn't cursed until right before he was supposed to meet Akane. he was practice fighting with his father over some cursed hot springs and fell in. He turns into a girl when splashed with cold water, his father turns into a panda. there are other cursed characters too like a pig, cat, and goose.

$40 for all that still isn't so bad 👀
OBO also good 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~they could be our pocket cosplays when we dont know wtf to do as a group~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Update: she said she would do $100 for all 3, but that alex's wig (the black one) isnt available, but the other two are, and she would include the shoes, however the green bodysuit needs the legs replaced bc the vinyl is peeling around the butt, and the red ones gloves have a peeled off spot on the area between the thumb and pointer finger. 
Shipping on it would be $18

So, if we split the cost it would be $39 each. I told her i'd let her know tomorrow if we are interested.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So i guess it's a matter of if we think its worth that and if we wanna split the cost
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): vinyl is peeling? like the vinyl peels off the backing?
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes vinyl can flake off if it's printed on and low quality, like imagine a t-shirt iron-on that's been through the wash too many times and how that peels/flakes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye its the joanns vinyl
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that shit peels if its used too much
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but surprisingly its just on the one green ones butt and nowhere else on any of the other suits xD she mustve had a THICC butt
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hrrrrnnggh Sam, Clover. I'm trying to sneak around but I'm dummy thicc and the clap from my vinyl keeps alerting the guards
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dskjhfkljsda
Bill: I need to find another infinity scarf to order for Jessica Jones... The one I ordered has been delayed twice now and Amazon just emailed me "You wanna cancel this my guy?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): followed by a comment on how con security used to be "please no glomping it could hurt someone" and now we've got gunmen and threats of violence <:pew:543202259085950996>
it's so true
N🆗ri (Marisa): what happened
N🆗ri (Marisa): the days where staff's biggest problem was scattering a group of 50 caramelldansen dancers and not "someone is handing out cookies with needles in them"
Bill: Caramelldansen is dangerous.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it poses a fire hazard
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, cause that song is FIREEEEEEEEEE 😎 <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXh4F006w0o
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woooo
Bill: I just got offended that Jess only got 9 likes for her 2B in 45 minutes. Not about my photo, just cause it’s JESS and people should like her. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You didn't put #cosplaygirl
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof prices of a photographer my friend uses
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _wait it’s sending_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): what a bargain
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OOF
Aldus Larian (Jess): HOLY
Bill: It is location shooting.
Bill: So that included travel to the site in the cost, finding the site, making sure you can shoot there...
Bill: Admittedly a 30 minute location shoot seems dumb to me.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah it was the thirty minutes part that got me
N🆗ri (Marisa): are there 3 people? new york, atlanta, and orlando are a little far from each other
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like you could end up driving kinda far if that’s the case??
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Delaware is small but you could easily drive an hour there and an hour back for a 30 minute shoot
Bill: An hour is within the normal commute distance for a job.
Bill: Getting past that you get to crazy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Driving two hours cumulatively for a 30 min shoot tho!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s whack
N🆗ri (Marisa): unless you go to different places for work on rotation, then 2-3 hours is normal
N🆗ri (Marisa): like regional managers
Bill: Let’s see... if normiecon was at that price, estimating about 6 sessions of time involved in that, without travel between places... collectively the group would have paid... 720 or 840 dollars.
N🆗ri (Marisa): brb becoming a pro photographer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah fuck physics lol
Bill: That’s not... a realistic thing Mawisa lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes it is there are lots of pro photographers
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like Hunter <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Bill: I just mean my estimate. I based it off of time spent and total projected returns.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 14 seems more fair than the “120 dollars for 5 photos” people but
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk 30 mins so short
N🆗ri (Marisa): bruh, real estate photography position open for $50
i know a lot about real estate i'm gonna be rich
Aldus Larian (Jess): GO GO GO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I know what houses look like YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo is a real estate agent and one of her tactics to sell houses with a pool was to get a bunch of kids (my friends and i) to play in it during open houses / while she was showing it to prospective clients
because it'd made people go from "hmm, we don't really need a pool it's just an unnecessary expense" to "oh wow look how much fun the kids will have if we get a house with a pool"
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: Oh yeah when con photography gets in the 120~150 range it's crazy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the prices have inflated so much in the last 5 years
Bill: It's still so meh to me. Limiting myself.
Bill: To time or shots.
Bill: I see how it's valuable when it's a business relationship (clients need a guarantee of what they're paying for and it covers photographers from getting roped into ridiculous "I need 100 headshots" situtations). But the longer I shoot the more fun and creative I get and I want to see the final result of all the shots I do edit so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my remilia image got 100 likes <:woah:543194447345876998>
i knew my face was editly nicely <:pew:543202259085950996>
