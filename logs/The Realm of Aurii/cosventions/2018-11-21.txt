No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Super Dangan Ronpa 2
They‚Äôre getting the whole cast together and I cosplay 2 characters they currently don‚Äôt have
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): I hope they get a gundam that would be so great but if not they have a souda
Which is surprising because gundam is more popular than soda lol
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Actually they‚Äôre missing a lot of popular characters that people cosplay im surprised. Maybe everyone sold their costumes after the hype died down.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): They have a lot of less common characters
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Friday of Katsu is 100% packed for me now why doesn‚Äôt stuff happen on other days

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Then Ochako 4-whenever
Bill: right, not doing BNHA group shoot.
Bill: ~~I'll believe 10 when i see it~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): RWBY is the better fandom tbj
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): BNHA is too impersonal
Bill: Can't say for sure, haven't mingled with BNHA at a shoot or anything. RWBY has proven unique before though.
Bill: well, if I'm involved in any these shoots tell me sooner rather than later.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): For now just Leanna
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Gotta see what the garritys  are doin

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I‚Äôm not super hyped to make Ochako either
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Maybe I should save hero suit for Zenkai
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And just do school uniform or gym outfit
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hmmmm that idea sounds more appealing
Bill: Her hero suit is lame, ngl. Puffy bracers and boots? body suit? And you were the one to point out she's got like a vagina line on it.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): IK ITS SO DUMB
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Momo is my second fav but lol no
Bill: Momo's outfit is dumber.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~we might not be doing ren and nora but if its v. important to you then maybe~~
Bill: Do remember you need to give yourself 15 minutes to half hour of sitting time every few hours in Pyrrha. Not the travel time blocks you have, just sitting.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Trutru
