Bill: I wanna post photo now but that dumb I gotta wait till morning. *But I WANNA and I want what I want cause I’m Hacker God.*
Bill: *now I'm looking up bowsette boosette cosplay and this is gold*
Bill: ye in general the cosplays (on the insta tag anyway) are more tame than art.
Bill: This was a good use of my time, better than work.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i've created a horrible thing in the bee fandom on tumblr and im in "fuck go back" mode right now.

Yang....as a zipper and i dont know how thsi happened. but there are edits and art happening and im scared.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How *don't* people find that attractive?
Bill: that's. Something.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YIPPER WTF XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....people are sending anon asks thats just  "YANGLE YANGLE YANGLE" which apparently is the sound the yipper makes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im fucking scared

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wtffff

N🆗ri (Marisa): should I make a newer version of ruby and fix up my crescent Rose
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So you, me, and <@334090409389195266> can do family shoot
Bill: That adorable.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): :3
Bill: Shit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Are they getting more new outfits for the new season or should I just make most recent season
Bill: There’s rumors of a new outfit for v7.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ooooh they are probably getting new outfits
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's been *strongly hinted* that they will be
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe I wait a bit
N🆗ri (Marisa): I do have her season one outfit still
N🆗ri (Marisa): Very warm
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH EAH SEASON 7 IS GONNA BE THAY ONE OUTFIT FROM ALIEXPRESS
Bill: LOL
N🆗ri (Marisa): Can’t wait
N🆗ri (Marisa): I miss their pockets. Monty made sure they all had lots of pockets.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ah. Her most recent stockings would be the biggest pain, I’d need help with that. But the rest could be done in a weekend if I find the fabric for cheap.
Bill: I’d say hold off on that outfit if you’re doing it for group up purposes... Next is light on the rwby cause most of BNE doesn’t go, maybe Ota but HOT, and then CCE is swimsuit variants.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Swimsuit rwby? Is that a confirmed group?
I was just thinking of new things I could make aside from stuff I want to enter in contests. I’m still really put off after Katsu but I’d like to get back into it eventually, and I’m saving the stuff I want to get really detailed with for that. But I gotta keep cosplayin.
Bill: Nothing wrong with focusing on the big things too.
Bill: You don’t need 9 new cosplays a con. :3
N🆗ri (Marisa): But then what will I wear
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 1 cosplay a day <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ?????????????
Bill: Cosplays that match your frwends!
N🆗ri (Marisa): One a day outside of cons right
Like for Sakura Sunday
N🆗ri (Marisa): I find the group cosplays on the facebooks. I join stranger groups that fall apart at the last minute.
Bill: Pair with ussssss
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ll be any person you need that y’all can’t find anyone else to be. Tis always been the case.
Bill: We need you in the lineup tho. Who will provide all the hand out poses.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Better cosplayers <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Not possible
