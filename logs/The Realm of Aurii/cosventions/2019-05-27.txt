Aldus Larian (Jess): das party invites have been sent <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WOO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): EXCITE
Aldus Larian (Jess): bless
Bill: I wonder how they keep people in heavy outfits cool on sets, ie fur armor like GoT.
Bill: Cause if they get sweaty it‚Äôll affect their hair, complexion...
Bill: Be a good to tip to reuse.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Big fans
Nokri (Marisa): cooling pads and lots of breaks
Nokri (Marisa): i might bring cooling pads to anext
Bill: Are those like inverse hand warmers?
Nokri (Marisa): ye!
Nokri (Marisa): they're an absolute necessity for comiket, i'd of died without them
Bill: Just stuck em on your face?
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): definitely yes
Nokri (Marisa): when not in cosplay i had one on the neck and one on the forehead
Nokri (Marisa): and one on each arm
Bill: Oh wow.
Bill: Sounds like a blessing for Ota.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh I use those when I overheat in my sleep in the summer!
Bill: ‚ÄúDo this scene like you have a stomachache‚Äù I‚Äôm so using that.
Bill: ‚ÄúJust. Pose like your about to hurt‚Äù
Bill: Gods, imagine doing 3 hours of make up and dressing in armor for a 5 second scene where you pretend to get burned to death by a dragon.
Nokri (Marisa): that's the dream
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): God I wish that were me
Nokri (Marisa): imagine spending $10,000 for your character to appear in a famous comic for one panel before burning to death
Nokri (Marisa): oh reportedly they could survive for more than one panel if $100,000 was donated but they only donated $10,000 so death it was.
Bill: I‚Äôm watching and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúis this different than cosplaying?‚Äù
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean... It's all costuming
Nokri (Marisa): a bit. uses different skills.
requires more acting experience and little to no makeup experience since usually there's a team of makeup artists that works on extras. the big actors will even have their own makeup team.
Bill: Oh yeah, I‚Äôm putting aside the acting.
Bill: But if filmmaking wasn‚Äôt an over saturated industry, cosplayers would make great hires.
Nokri (Marisa): o costume making yeah
I used a sewing method that was invented by the costume designer of Game of Thrones for my Nowi costume so the show has been very helpful
Bill: For makeup teams, for extras...
Nokri (Marisa): i think a lot of cosplayers fill those positions
there's a weird line though where it crosses over into fashionistas, which isn't mutually exclusive from cosplaying but is a very different social world
Bill: I can totally see that.
Bill: It‚Äôs like a fanfic writer getting into editing.
Nokri (Marisa): o lots of fan fic writers are becoming authors and editors too yeah
Nokri (Marisa): the advent of online and self publishing really helped that
Bill: Kinda cool when you can get into a career because of your hobbies skills.
Bill: Like, cosplay photographer to wedding photographer is a simple transition and happens a lot, but going from cosplayer to pro makeup artist for night walkers?
Bill: That‚Äôs a Cinderella story.
Nokri (Marisa): a few years ago they were scouting makeup artists at new york comic con, i remember they had the guys from uhhh. face off? some kind of makeup competition TV show in the dealers hall
Nokri (Marisa): makeup artist is such a frantic and high pressure job, my neighbor was one
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA face off!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I wanted to do that as a career for a long ass time but had one taste of it in the real world and hard passed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Very stressful
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I dont rhink I can do anything directly working with a client
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Or ON a client
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Because yikes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I lost 10 years of my life in one day
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ooooof
Elfriede Faun (Tom): sounds awful
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!334090409389195266> between these two, any idea which is better for thor?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.amazon.com/Kryssma-Glueless-Resistant-Synthetic-Replacement/dp/B014KQDCE0/ref=pd_sbs_194_1/146-0024517-3332268?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B014KQDCE0&pd_rd_r=8c2e5a7c-7f75-11e9-9902-df0ec59c45d5&pd_rd_w=o5Cza&pd_rd_wg=QiMcO&pf_rd_p=588939de-d3f8-42f1-a3d8-d556eae5797d&pf_rd_r=CBZX10MZY5JAF73S5ED4&psc=1&refRID=CBZX10MZY5JAF73S5ED4

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i have half a mind of which i think is better but i wanted your opinion
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause i know nothin bout wigs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): What are you planning to do style wise? Do you want volume in the roots?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The second one the roots are pointed upwards so there will be a lot of volume, but hard to part
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im hoping to do like a little more subtle version of this
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://i.pinimg.com/236x/76/af/18/76af18a795dac147684b9d99ace6ef5e--cool-girl-hairstyles-hairstyles-for-prom.jpg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And the first one has a more defined part
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh ok then I recommend the second one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok thats the one i was eyeing too LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i figured that style is good cause thor has the half up half down look
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and the beard braid
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so this combines both
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea! I love that idea
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hella thats the wig im goin with then
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WOOOOO!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH i get the heterochromatic eyes i forgot about that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thatll be dope
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OMG YEEEESSS

Bill: The prior TOO early?
Nokri (Marisa): ooo. oh yeah. i would be best with a later time because with my luck something on the costume will break during the photoshoot

Bill: I have time to fill Friday... literally day kappa.

Bill: Sure Georgia. We'll block a half hour/hour, are you planning other shoots or a change costume?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont plan a costume change til formal probably

Bill: Okay, you care if I don't give you a set time to start? You have an open schedule rn and I dunno if everyone else does.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): id like to block off an official time at some point cause ill start building a schedule eventually
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): preferably morning
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but ye you can schedule other peeps first case im flexible
Bill: I'll let you know tomorrow or the next day.
Bill: Going to ask people tomorrow.
Bill: I have seen castle in the sky okay.
Bill: I won't lie Mawisa, I know *nothing* about Ranma, but Yuki and Yona are both choice and Sheeta I can probably work with.
Bill: Caaaaan you commit to a time friday right now for which ever costume?
Nokri (Marisa): ranma is mostly for the ball so that ok
any time now is good, i won't know anything i wanna do until the schedule comes out <:rip:369476083248267274> but there's no autograph i'm absolutely dying for
Bill: Okay, any preference?
Nokri (Marisa): nop!

Nokri (Marisa): that fine
Bill: Perfect 4 to 5 is MAWISA TIMU
Bill: Georgia I have you for 11 right now, I'll tell you if it changes, Toga is an indoor shoot anyway. Very parking garage. Gwen'll probably be fine, Yang... I'm pretty swamped for Saturday and I still have Yang in the pipeline... I'm going to call that a maybe?
Bill: Jesssss are you (and Tom by proxy) thinking the formal at all?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pew:543202259085950996>

Bill: I have nothing for it and no real interest beyond 'everyone else will be there'...
Bill: eyyyy <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: You can probably wear anything formal tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): is it like 80s prom?
Bill: Not sure.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 80s prom dresses were terrible
Bill: I'm all for dinner, or raving friday so you guys can... Or just wandering con lol. I kinda liked what we did with the boudoir but I assume you have no plans for that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~oh no dont tempt me... tom mentioned unknown for friday~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): seeing as im doing an actualy formal even on sunday idk if imma wanna do formal
Bill: ~~Oh no that'd be spicy~~
Bill: Technically I should tackle social anxiety and go dance with stranger girls at said formal, but I A. don't really dance, B. don't stand out C. am not actually going to beat social anxiety and not beating it will depress me.
Bill: So Uh. *Yes Unknown do it do it do it*
Nokri (Marisa): is that just for boudoir or do you think he'll wear unknown in the day? maybe could bring ray
Bill: ***RaY?!***
Nokri (Marisa): or not
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no hes doing unknown in the day at some point
Aldus Larian (Jess): he mentioned friday
Nokri (Marisa): 3 costumes in a day is highly managable
Bill: No one said anything about it when I mentioned it but *I guess* I need to find an another story V wig.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mawisa what u for formal?
Nokri (Marisa): i do ranma üíÉ
Aldus Larian (Jess): neato!
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk if im in a boudoir mood tbh <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: that's your call lol.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lets so do a photoshoot at the pool <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Valid.
Nokri (Marisa): POOL SHOOT
Bill: Oh oof I went to check if I really needed a different wig for another story V and I DID see how not good I looked IN V.
Bill: https://tenor.com/view/mystic-messenger-707-seven-gif-7985123
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò¶
Aldus Larian (Jess): if u dont like the way you look then maybe not?
Bill: But I like V.

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye no prob üòéüëâ
