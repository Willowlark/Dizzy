Bill: ~~Tom has more followers than Kamistry~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Cosplay famous tomukun
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): yeahhh know, I feel bad
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He's def better
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Although his are like
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 100% Leeds these days
Bill: 👀
Bill: *Gunna get lewd Tombo?*
Bill: ~~Lewd Tombo shoot~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeAH I SHLULDNT HAVE LOOKED THEM UP
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ye boi
Bill: To be 💯 clear, I meant cosplaying as Tombo, from Kiki.
Bill: 
Bill: One (1) lewd Where's Waldo knock off?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): O
Bill: *you can be any kind of Lewd you want to tho*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Tom is gonna do lewds?  👀
Bill: you were the one talking about a boudoir Renora.
Bill: *Which needs to happen, be it someone else even, because Renora needs more representation in this damn fandom*
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Katsu boudoir party
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): No one on instagram associates me with any one cosplay which means I have way too many cosplays and I’m decent at all of them or I’m atrocious at every costume <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's the first one
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Def the first one
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Wow I can’t believe it’s the second one
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: 
Bill: Speaking of Katsu... We're back to 7.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): AGHHH NO D:
Bill: Andrew needs to back out for personal reasons.
Bill: The neutral evil solution would be to tell Tristan we don't have space, drop a room, be done with it.
Bill: But I can't do that to Tristan.
Bill: The true neutral would be to inform him (and everyone else officially) of the price hike that comes with it and hope he drops due to cost. Which then reduces the cost for everyone else by proxy.
Bill: <@!228287793099440128> I just wanna check since I can't infer from you're making of cosplans, you're still in right?
デイブ: Katsucon, yes
Bill: Kk good.
Bill: Didn't really doubt it, but figured I'd check now.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~scope out good photo locations this weekend 👀 ~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So the room is Me, Bill, Tom, Jess, Dave, Marisa, Tristan?
Bill: yeah.
Bill: I know you mentioned hammertime; but I feel like if we can get the 6 maybe that's just the better scenario here.
Bill: 6 is cheaper than 8.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea... i feel bad now though just yoinking a room from someone
Bill: Right, which is why I'mma just present the cost and secretly hope Tristan says 'too rich for my blood, I'm out'.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if he didnt buy a ticket already, or knows womeone else he can jump in with
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): dang katsu is a rooming mess
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Darn I feel bad cause Scott is so nice
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): What’s the expense for 6 versus 8?
Bill: 150 a person versus 240ish.
Bill: It's... a much better deal.
デイブ: What if there's a blizzard
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we die
デイブ: *sets will to my cousins dog*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Okay so we tell Tristan
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If he still agrees we recruit Scott too?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If he disagrees we drop down to one room
Bill: That's the thought I have.
Bill: Cause even with Scott, that's still pretty high in price, we're long out of ideas for people to bring... Our Katsu squad is just too small for two rooms.
Bill: If Tristan can't make that cost, at the least I want to ask BNE if anyone's got one floating spot for him.
Bill: ~~if we went to Mag instead, I'd have taken the rest of this week off too~~
Bill: 🤦
デイブ: ~~looks to the side as i continue to pack for mag~~
Bill: 👀
Bill: ~~got room?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): rip us tristans still
Bill: uuuugh Sardines sounds like a better dealllll
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): UGH 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): whos sleeping on the balcony?
Bill: ~~careful Marisa will volunteer~~
Bill: ~~Mawisa is small, she can fit on one bed with you and Tom~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats true
Bill: Would... you consider that? Cause like, I assumed you guys weren't into the triple bed thing.
デイブ: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~im barely into the double bed thing~~
Bill: ~~that's why I need to ask specifically here~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ill sleep triple with Marisa <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: There's no third genius.
Bill: > Tom sleeps with Marisa and Georgia
> Jess has bed
> Jess, looking at her husbando in bed with two other women: *Well, I wanted more space*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Me, Marisa, and me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Three
Bill: *I question Rutgers physics program*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _the best and the brightest_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So want me to ask scott?
Bill: That commits us to the two... Sardine mode ISN'T something squad wants right?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’d rather pay like 80 bucks more for room
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause it’s not just us, but our stuff too
Bill: alright kk. We'll reach out to Scott...
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): On it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: <@!350847001937707022> I don't suppose you and Nick want to go to Katsu.
Bill: (We know you lurk now, mahaha)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea im not really into sardining
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i get all claustrophobic with lot of stuff and it will actually make me have a worse time 😬
Bill: me either, I just read the not struck out "thats true" as like a 'I'm reconsidering' "thats true".
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean i will consider it if its the last last last option but ill wait til all avenues are exhausted
Bill: It's not an option if Scott signs on. Sardine mode is 7 afai'm concerned.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well yea but thats what i mean, if he says no
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk I’d rather work some more hours and fork over the money
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like I’ll have a Beastlord sword and a mini nuke launcher... I don’t wanna has to spoon my props to have somewhere to store them
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea im gonna hand magnihld and some other tol bois too hopefully
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m also trying to figure out what to do about that Thursday cause I’m realizing I have a lab until 9 that day
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): AND it’s Valentine’s Day
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yeaaaa :/
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): vday brunch? late drive?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah I’m thinking I’m gonna do a late drive but it’ll mean picking up my badge will probably have to wait
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I wish they mailed them out oof
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I may switch the day my lab is because I’m lowkey overloading Thursday...
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you can switch it? :0
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah there’s different sections cause we have 60 majors and 15 per section
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So there’s a Monday morning, Monday night, and Tuesday night section as well
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Every other class only has one section tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh neat!
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I don't have a prob with triple bed but I know Jess needs her space 👌
デイブ: So you bill and I in a bed, got it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Sextuple bed 👀
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): we'll get one of those rooms with the big heart beds and all pile in
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): YEAH
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): How do we get a rooms that is 100% bed 🤔
Bill: Lots of air mattresses.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Put the props to sleep in the bed
Bill: So I'm playing with mint...
Bill: This is a rough number, but between every con since Zenkai two years ago, I've handled $9,569.55 for hotel bills.
Bill: ~~After Katsu we'll break 10k, good job team~~
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): <@184437198865563648> we are looking into it haha. Wouldn't mind going just not sure how itd work yet
