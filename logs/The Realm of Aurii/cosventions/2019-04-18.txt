Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao yea
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/media/set?set=a.2293662400850524&type=3&sfns=mo I‚Äôm terribly unimpressed!
Bill: Backdrop photos suck.
Bill: I think I'm going to change how I do my photo storage...
Bill: The external hard drive isn't something I can do *forever* after all.
Bill: I think I'll get a smaller SSD to export photos onto and do selections from, and once I go thin down to my edit pool for the given shoot, I can transition the raw files to the NAS drive. It'll be a little slower to access, but I already use cloud sync via my tablet which doesn't access the raw files anyway, only copies made to store in the cloud... So the process has more steps, and might slow down export time a bit, but other than that no issues... I'll get additional safety from using the NAS as my main storage drive, cause that has data lose protection and the SSD will be safer than the HDDs I've been using...
Bill: I just won't be able to bring my old files with me to Georgia's or something to edit on my laptop. I'd need to use tablet or copy them back to the external.
Bill: Or if I don't copy them off the SSD until I finish the edits, that could work... Assuming I don't backlog myself TOO much.
Bill: Q2 2018 photos were only half the size of the drive though, and that's con season.
Bill: oh right...
Bill: hmm.
Bill: There's lightroom cc for my mac as well, which would use the synced files rather than the actual files in lightroom classic...
Bill: Hahaha lol posting a bunch of filter selfies on my conference call lost me a follower.
Bill: It's my face isn't it.

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im tempted to say yes because less time with ethan but also kinda awkward about it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i asked him if he would rather go to rocky
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if hes a bitch about it were goin to color me mine
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't really care honestly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and actually I never factored travel time since it's a Friday during rush hour so my normally 2 hour drive to your area will probably be more like 2.5-3sh üò¨
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so whatever we end up doing, I probably won't be there until 7-7:30 anyway
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm up for anything. But less time with Ethan sounds like üòò üëå
Bill: That filter is shitty damn.
Bill: It never triggers at the right time.
