Bill: If you're polling all your friends looking for someone to say don't, don't.

Bill: At least one person could use that. XP
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): execution
Bill: ~~alright topical~~
Bill: Pretty sure that's Sean Meehan too, he's friends with Gen.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): omg callback to that one trainwreck of a "science experiment" panel
Bill: trust me that was my first thought but since the guy is well known and not a weirdo...
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "GIRLS ONLY"
Bill: I *refuse* to go alone tho. ~~ironic?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): il go if theres nothing better to do
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): bring a dakimakura

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "hi are you here for the how to flirt panel?"
"yes"
"isnt that a wedding ring?"
"yes"
Bill: ~~limitus test~~
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~going to a panel on how to flirt does not prove to me that other men besides my husband think im attractive i.e. the point of the theoretical litmus test~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lmao
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea cuz making sex sounds is so hard
Bill: Step one: Punch self in groin to raise octaves.
Bill: Still, for an erotica related panel it's better than 'worst hentai'.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well yea but they arnt reall in the same realm. this is voice acting that was shock facotr
Bill: fair. Masquerade is sunday, weird.
Bill: There's a starting a podcast panel and I'm mildly curious since me being salty about stuff could be a fun podcast maybe?
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> (Tom isn't in your name again and I almost tagged someone else... =T)  are you going to do the blaze blue tourney saturday?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oh snap greggo is retiring from cons suddenly and immediately
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): and he just recently started doing promotions on youtube. i wonder what happened.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): and he was announced as a guest for several cons next year? i guess he's cancelling them?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo ive seen his name alot but i never went to any of his panels i dont think
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i've been in them a few times. they're neat and he's good at what he does, but he's got a bad rep among con staff for being a little hard to deal with
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): uh oooo
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): 
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): o dang
Bill: that screams he did something bad.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): he makes it sound like it's something financial? but I wonder what, so suddenly?
from what i gather, some people have been complaining about him and trying to mess with his reputation, but he's not a bad guy from what I know and I doubt a little internet pushing around would make him stop what he's been doing for so long. he says 20 years, he's definitely been doing it for the last 10 i've been attending cons.

the main reason staff don't like him very much is he's a bit full of himself at times and a little stuck up behind the scenes
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): maybe a person thing? but it's shocking that this would cause permanent retirement.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats really odd
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): yeah. just 5 days ago he was talking about doing new youtube premieres of his con shows.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i see, and he shas alot booked for this yera
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH like he just announced Anime Milwaukee and stuff. i'm really curious aahhh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he delteed his facebooka nd twitter too
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): wait really?? same guy? i was just on his facebook and he said more details would come later
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo nvm maybe jus the link i clicked doent work
Bill:
