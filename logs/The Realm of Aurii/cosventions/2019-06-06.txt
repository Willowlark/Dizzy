Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You can borrow my Yona jacket!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I pack it for u anyways
Bill: I can say for sure Imma do Kaminari at Ota.
Bill: I’m super disappointed I can’t be him for Next.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yona good! But Dani is also very good! Do whichever 🙏
N👌kri (Marisa): NO!! Save room in your suitcase!!!
N👌kri (Marisa): im very sad and frustrated and imploding on myself rn sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Bill: you okay. Like you don't have to apologize, obviously whatever you're feeling is important. 👌
Bill: is it the ironing space?
N👌kri (Marisa): no it's i'm a big stupid moron
N👌kri (Marisa): who can't get this costume done
Aldus Larian (Jess): No yo not 😭
N👌kri (Marisa): i am.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I do not believe your
N👌kri (Marisa): look at literally everything i've ever done in my pointless life
Bill: To be frank for a hot sec... We love your cosplays. If you want to convince us 'everything you've ever done is pointless', pointing at your cosplay isn't the best way to start. :3c
N👌kri (Marisa): my cosplay are awful and should be burned as fuel for a freezing family in russia
these boots are as bad as akko's and katarina's combined
Bill: HUSH YOU
Bill: AKKO WAS MY FAVORITE COSPLAY
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just take a breath.
Bill: I LOVED THAT
N👌kri (Marisa): akko sucked im sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): You don't need to apologise! 😭
Bill: 1. listen to Jess and take a breather.
2. Don't apologize for being AWESOME as Akko. That shoot was so much fun!
Bill: Your cosplay was awesome too!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Even if your cosplay was a paper bag it still wouldn't be a problem to us
N👌kri (Marisa): i gotta finish this tho. slight chance i might sit in the corner of the room silently weeping and finishing this costume but i can do it in the closet also so that no one is uncomfortable
N👌kri (Marisa): you good photographer but akko bad costume. boots jutted out weirdly, the lining stuck out, and the wig was horrid
Bill: NOPE
Aldus Larian (Jess): No don't do that 😭 push her to otakon or something. Or just go with what you have!
Bill: Akko is one of my FAVORITE cosplays you've done.
Bill: You CAN"T convince me it was bad.
Bill: It special to me!
Bill: :3c
N👌kri (Marisa): i was looking forward to doing the walk on with flora and i have to bring her for that
Bill: You gotta wear Akko again so we can get Andrew to cosplay Andrew.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Let us see da shoe
Bill: For the meme.
N👌kri (Marisa): and it'd be nice to stand a partial chance at even getting a judges award but i know that's an impossible dream
N👌kri (Marisa): you guys don't need to waste your time comforting me, it's ok.
Bill: Also if you aren't satisfied with Raph, work on her more *after* Next. Nothing stopping you from improving each piece of your ~~fursona~~ furry waifu until it's good.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): whatever you gotta do, if you wanna do last minute stuff at con thats all good 👌 it might be good for you to take a break
Bill: ^
N👌kri (Marisa): i took a break earlier for half an hour
Aldus Larian (Jess): You not wasting our time
Bill: Yeah. I'd say take a walk but your neighborhood is crazy.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): might be a work on it tomorrow kinda break
Bill: ^
N👌kri (Marisa): i haven't packed though and i need to find my other costumes and print references and the tickets and get money from the bank and find batteries tomorrow, i won't have time
Aldus Larian (Jess): Show da boot
Bill: What batteries?
N👌kri (Marisa): i'm getting to AC early because bojo is teaching the class at 4
boot is on me and it's very dark where im sitting
camera batteries
N👌kri (Marisa): i also have to free up spcae on my phone aaa
N👌kri (Marisa): i always do this
Bill: Deep breaths, one thing at a time.
N👌kri (Marisa): my breathing's naturally pretty slow
Bill: What kind of batteries your camera take? If I have some in the house I'll just throw them in  my bag.
N👌kri (Marisa): it's ok you've given me plenty
Bill: *what kind of batteries*
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~imo shoes matter like the least in a cosplay~~
Bill: ^
N👌kri (Marisa): not when the shoes are thigh highs
Bill: OwO
Bill: ~~are you wearing the thigh high crocs~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **NO**
Aldus Larian (Jess): Flats and brown thigh highs<:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Raphtaleia has knee corsets <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: what the flying fuck are knee corsets.
N👌kri (Marisa): yeah that's what i'm doing right now
N👌kri (Marisa): it's a little below the knee though
N👌kri (Marisa): on mine
N👌kri (Marisa): because mine suck
El🆓de Faun (Tom): nah hers looks about there too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): slightly shifted down
El🆓de Faun (Tom): the fact taht your doing them at all im sure will make it look great
Bill: Why does she have corsets on her KNEES
El🆓de Faun (Tom): im sure most peopole would avoid it
Bill: Sorry I'm still on that.
N👌kri (Marisa): kneed corsets
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do you have like the dress part, wog, ears and tail?
Bill: Unless your Raphtalia looks like this yours is good.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): AGHHH
N👌kri (Marisa): wig is drying because the white thread i sewed the ears with stands out too much so i painted it brown. dress is.... done i believe. needs to be ironed thoguh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): https://giphy.com/gifs/movie-godfather-the-l4FGGafcOHmrlQxG0
N👌kri (Marisa): omg it's raining so much i'm terrified
N👌kri (Marisa): my raphtalia is much worse i don't even have the tattoo rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I just heard dat thunder but it hasnt started raining here
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo u done!
N👌kri (Marisa): o not that version
Bill: Mawisa you have no need for a cleavage tattoo.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): she drew the corsets about the knee
El🆓de Faun (Tom): above*
Aldus Larian (Jess): U could do dat version for a next and den work on it more?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): wouldnt even have noticed
Aldus Larian (Jess): I know nothing of this anime I'm sorry
Bill: Jess has a point.
Bill: It's basically the same dress.
Bill: you will be raccoon waifu no matter which version you do.
N👌kri (Marisa): boi gets summoned to be a legendary hero in another world. he's one of 4 heroes. he parties with a hot girl to level up. girl swindles him and accuses him of being a rapist and ruins his life. he becomes an outcast and can't level up to save the world because his weapon is a shield and he can't use anything else. he buys a slave to be his sword and also gets a magic chicken
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think if you have dress and wog with ears and tail you will still be recognizable
El🆓de Faun (Tom): you wont see your upper chest right?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): no need for the tat
Bill: Ye the tattoo is *totally* pointless for you.
Bill: Unless you planned on Boudoir Raph.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i realized ive never seen a raphtalia cosplayer
Bill: Nope.
Bill: Mawisa will be FIRST
N👌kri (Marisa): can do boudoir but would need tattoo
N👌kri (Marisa): anime is pretty recent. still airing
El🆓de Faun (Tom): there is this comforting picture of a froggo
Bill: it's only if you wanted to lol, I'm not saying you have to. XD Even if you did, put that off till another con.
Bill: ~~boudoir is annoying to do at cons tbh even it's the best place to do it~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ||btw marisa I know your sad but im so glad your being open with us and telling us how you feel a bit more since you came back||
N👌kri (Marisa): sorry. i'm just always anxious.
N👌kri (Marisa): that's why i left, so you wouldn't have to deal with my feelings
Aldus Larian (Jess): No mawisa we want you to tell us!
Bill: Yup. It's comforting honestly.
Bill: Not because you're sad. Obviously.
Bill: But it's less scary knowing your sad here, with us, where we can support you; rather than you sad alone somewhere while we worry.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): We wove you!
N👌kri (Marisa): dont do that
Bill: You can't tell us what to dooooo~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's too kate
Aldus Larian (Jess): You are already in our hearts
Bill: 💙 💙 💙
Bill: ~~it's blue cause I'm the V cosplayer~~
Bill: Which I never would have done without YOU Mawisa.
Bill: Thank you.
Bill: *Also Jess and Erik and Tom*
Bill: *Marisa just happened to be relevant at that moment, you are no lesser*
N👌kri (Marisa): without them <:pew:543202259085950996>
i didn't do anything i wasn't even in the country
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah Marisa's the best
N👌kri (Marisa): sorry for scumming up your hearts
Aldus Larian (Jess): No no no
Bill: Mawisa, why do you think I said that?
N👌kri (Marisa): i'm really not. i'm a fake, most of my teeth aren't real
Bill: I'm curious.
N👌kri (Marisa): because you're trying to be a good person and say empty words to make me feel better
Bill: I never, ever say empty words.
Bill: *Why does NO ONE believe me about that, it's a freaking pride point of mine*
N👌kri (Marisa): i know, but i can't believe otherwise. i don't believe there's anything good about me and no one can find anything good about me
Bill: * We know the good in you.
Bill: But also I only wanted to cosplay mystic messenger after ya'll did After Story during Katsu. You guys were having so much fun doing Ray photos I wanted to join in.
Bill: Hence V.
Bill: So you were VERY much part of that.
N👌kri (Marisa): didn't you have v before that?
my ray is bad. it was bad at katsu and will be bad friday
Bill: Your Ray is canon Ray.
Bill: ~~I think of you alot when I read Ray texts and then I'm always nice to Ray~~
Bill: Jess showed me a fem Ray once!
Bill: It was cute!
Bill: Also made me think of you!
Bill: And to your question, did not have V before that.
Bill: The only thing I cosplayed before Zenkai with V/Pilot Boi/casual Mirio was uniform Mirio iirc?
Bill: At ANYC.
Bill: No wait, I cosplayed Angel Beats to cosplay with Georgia.
Bill: *But that was pretty lame in the long run so let's pretend I started with Mirio*
Aldus Larian (Jess): *crashes through window* 
Sorry I was drawing a bath
Marisa your Ray is great! It's better then the Ray that chertiz picked for Thier booth at otakon
N👌kri (Marisa): not tru they were amazing
Bill: ~~you weren't there how can you even know~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N👌kri (Marisa): pics
Bill: No one takes pictures at anime cons.
Bill: Silly Mawisa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean I also love theirs but like. I think yours is better at least comparable
N👌kri (Marisa): my collar is all wrong
N👌kri (Marisa): the first one was much nicer
Aldus Larian (Jess): Your Ray is gud missy
N👌kri (Marisa): [men in black iii antagonist voice] lets agree to disagree
Bill: Marisa: "My Ray isn't good enough, you wouldn't drink the elixir and stay to be with me"
Jess, on her third glass of elixir: "You say WHAAAT?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Basically
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~I mean it's wine rn but~~
That could be changed
N👌kri (Marisa): ive driven jess to drink aaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was already drinking! I'm doing that fancy wine on the tub thing ya know
Aldus Larian (Jess): I got a cable and everything
Aldus Larian (Jess): And bubbles
N👌kri (Marisa): aa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is that you screaming?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or like "ah"
N👌kri (Marisa): screm
Aldus Larian (Jess): No no scream
N👌kri (Marisa): a
Bill: I dunno, *drinking?* That's pretty scream worthy.
Bill: Jess how *could you*
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭 I sowwy
N👌kri (Marisa): is my fault i'm sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): No is not!
Aldus Larian (Jess): You silly!
Bill: 
Bill: ~~was that camera on shit~~
Andrew: looooooooooooooooool
Aldus Larian (Jess): Biru the cap is on <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: oh god it is XD
Bill: *You expect me, an ~~alcoholic~~ connoisseur to drink Jim Bean*
Bill: AH spider.
Bill: That's actually scream worthy.
Bill: ~~also if I was drinking hard liquor on a wednesday night alone my parents would definitely get very concerned and I already didn't hide how stressed I was yesterday from them so I ain't bourboning on a wednesday~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): How would they know if you're in your room
N👌kri (Marisa): when the police show up
Bill: They could come in...?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): youre a casual man havin a casual drink
Bill: And any bottle I'd drink from is downstairs on the bar.
Bill: Which is where it would end up again.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wat
Aldus Larian (Jess): Your parents just walk into your room? <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: When I'm in here and they want to talk to me?
Bill: Why not?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like without knocking or anything?
Bill: I mean there's a knock yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like what if u nakie? 😳
Bill: I'm well past the age of scrabbling to hide things from them in the time between knock and entry.
Bill: Oh awkward when you line them up like that.
Andrew: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrlVVELkSmw
Bill: I close the door... and they knock...?
Bill: And I say come in...?
Bill: This isn't that *groundbreaking*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hide while you say come in
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
Bill: No more so than if Andrew wants to talk to me when we lived together
Bill: That's what I meant by being too old to scrabble and hide things.
Bill: I don't like the idea of sneaking things around my parents.
Bill: Anyone, really.
Bill: Not to mention my extended family has multiple cases of addiction; I don't need hard liquor on a week night.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wait but what if nakie like jess said
Bill: (because I absolutely have addictive tendencies)
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well yea that's a whole different thing
Bill: Then I say... "don't come in" and they don't?
Bill: Like I said this isn't groundbreaking
Bill: ~~I'm nude in my room not even 5 minutes in the morning when I get dressed, do you people run around in the buff all day or?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I guess I was under the impression nthat you wanted to be able to drink at home and wanted to hide it
Bill: Oh yeah no. I don't want to hide it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean yeah. We don't have AC so summer is nakie time
Bill: WELL then.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also Im not big on pants
Aldus Larian (Jess): We have no AC dude it's like 100 in here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah man aint no thang
Bill: That not a like 'shocked british man' WELL then that's like a 'oh I never would have guessed' WELL then.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont want my dad walkin in on a pantsless child but its cool if it just me
Bill: Definitely not my thing.
Bill: So yes, it's not really an issue in my house.
Bill: ~~and that's not a judgement either, whatever works for you is great~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm a little confused by your predicament. You want to drink but you don't want your parents to know you're drinking because you don't want them to think you have a drinking problem?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or did I completely misread that
Bill: There isn't a predicament. My parents would question why I was drinking hard liquor on a wednesday night. My family doesn't do that, we've only started drinking wine/beer through the week after I graduated college. 

To *me*, hard liquor is for social times and weekends. Bourbon is best in good company. If I was drinking it during the week, I'd stop and say "why am I doing this" because in college I set a rule for myself to keep liquor on weekends. I set that rule cause my extended family has addiction problems, and *everyone* knows I'm already an obsessive person. I enjoy my liquor, but I always keep any eye out for *why* I'm drinking and how often, because of that.
Bill: While my original college drinking rules have long faded, I still would question why I'm drinking hard liquor alone on a wednesday night.
Bill: Therefore I would assume my parents would as well, and then they'd ask the same questions. I wouldn't want to worry them over me just wanting to casually have a bourbon, so I don't bother.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Opps on forgot to time my facemask
Bill: And none of this is a judgement on anyone else's drinking habits. I expect I'll drink more frequently when I move out, though in the wine/beer family because of my own concerns. Drinking during the week isn't a normal thing in my house, and it certainly could be without problems, it just isn't and I have no motivation to change it.
Bill: Clearer? Clearer.
Bill: Like Jess's face now.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's covered in gunk
Aldus Larian (Jess): Pomegranate gunk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just don't see why it's a problem to drink if you wanna I guess?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea me neither? Bit I do mixed drinks not straight liquor
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If I'm in the mood for a drink it's usually a bit of the blackberry moonshine or occasionally a gin and tonic
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just casually in my room while I do stuff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): now if you're drinking because of depression, then yeah, that's a sign to be worried
Bill: It's not a problem. It's just not the norm in my house.
Bill: And as for my own vigilance? iirc one of the reasons Tom doesn't drink at all is addiction in the family. That's one way of being aware of it, mine's another.
Bill: Now is 66 all weekend Jeans or shorts weather.
Bill: Not that I have a choice for Hazel/Jessica.
Bill: Oh nevermind 71 and humid, shorts.
Andrew: Im just glad its sunny.
Andrew: Im tire dof rain.
Andrew: And that i can actually go outside without freezing this time
Bill: 
Bill: I mean.
Bill: XD
Andrew: well then
Andrew: ok bill
Andrew: when i checked a couple days ago
Andrew: it said sunny
Andrew: god damn
Bill: That was a 'shocked british man' well then.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Never trust the weather <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: So part of me misses the formals a bit, but I *really* don't miss packing suitjackets.
Aldus Larian (Jess): *laughs nervously at suit jacket folded in suitcase*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO FORMALS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have nothing packed

Bill: Oh, I updated it on the second image, it's 6 yeah.

Bill: There a chance we're doing pool shoots friday evening... Kinda a waste to not have golden hour saturday.
Bill: or really friday.
Bill: It k though. I can de gear ~~and drink~~ sooner.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't count on the pool shoot tho, like ye possible but don't like avoid other stuff cuz of it
Bill: there's nothing to avoid lol
Bill: Odds are after I finish Kimono Neo with Kirsten we'll just be like 'cool bye' and that's it for the day. XD
Bill: I left space in case we got to chatting but like. It me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean if you really don't wanna waste Goldie hour we could do uknown x mc but it m predicting bif tired Tom by them
Bill: lol I suggested that before, I'm already down for that.
Bill: We can do a shoot for that *not* in a shitty corner of the Otakon hotel.
Bill: More outdoor.
Bill: Basically I'll just find you when I finish with Kirsten and we'll decide what to do then.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea my wig was fucked at ota too

Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): bill ur sched looked too busy for that right?
Bill: Yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well we'll see who's around, maybe we could grab someone for pics at some point
Bill: Or just wait till Erik does Jaune.
Bill: He's still doing that iirc.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): bought the hoodie, gotta do it now
N👌kri (Marisa): I’m trying to find ray’s flower since it’s the only good part of the costume and I can’t find it aaaa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean we definitely wanna shoot full jnpr when erik makes a kickass jaune
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): just figured if im gonna suit up and jess is gonna nora up might as well

Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye! He ren
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I thought that said "Tom is getting into Ren" like as in wearing ren
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoop. He hasn't worn Ren since ota 😮

Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok we'll see what happens!
Bill: Fair warning Mawisa Tom and Jess are time restricted to before 8pm. They have to leave. 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I mean Tom said we'd stay to 8 "at least" but I wouldn't shedudle anything past like 7
Bill: Better warning then ye.
Bill: Which would kill the only actual time I have, 7 to 8 saturday.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm probably gonna change after the hazel shoot
Bill: So ye nix that.
N👌kri (Marisa): Main issue is Raphtalia is incredibly stuffy, hot, and hard to breathe in
N👌kri (Marisa): Difficult to take pictures in
Bill: Focus on Raph. Tom's not huge on Ren, but I know he'll do him again.
N👌kri (Marisa): As photog
Aldus Larian (Jess): Das ok no worries fren
N👌kri (Marisa): I worry
Bill: Now you understand when we say we'll worry about you anyway. ❤
Aldus Larian (Jess): No. No worry
Bill: Mawisa, do you know what you're cosplaying in the afternoon friday now?
Bill: You wanted a shoot at 4 for whatever it would be lo
Bill: Actually cosplaying has it's downsides... I was thinking about how the Kaminari wig could be used as Jaune, but then the JNPR would be out a photog. I have no intention of ever being The Jaune of course, but this keeps happening where I want photos by me of me. XD
N👌kri (Marisa): oo. <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Bill: It okay. I already didn't know lol, another day or two won't hurt. 👌
Bill: I apparently ordered the "God of beer" shirt tuesday to arrive tomorrow like I was going to Fat Thor at Next.
Bill: But I haven't greaser'd the wig.
N👌kri (Marisa): Is jess doing hiyori
I can bring mine and lay on the ground
Bill: I think she's doing MC instead.
Bill: Someone needs to do man boob Momo.
Bill: That’d be a trip.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): oo should add yukine to my cosplans if I haven't already
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The ever growing list
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I drop Hiyori I was thinking of doing her half day Saturday instead of Nora all day but nah
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Have babe you have several pairs of black fingerless gloves?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I do?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have 1 I know
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Was thinking for rave 9s 2b it would work
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That's why I was asking if you have multiple
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have at least 1 but I have other black gloves I could cut? I'd have to find them tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oo if I could find my winter ones that would be fine
El🆓de Faun (Tom): They old anyways
N👌kri (Marisa): made another flower but technically it's not a rose it's like 10 fake petunias mashed together
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aww you couldn't find? 😭

N👌kri (Marisa): ye can't find original 😭

Aldus Larian (Jess): OH DAS PRETTY
N👌kri (Marisa): someone's gonna come up and be like "really? a petunia? it's supposed to be a *rose*, fake fan"
Aldus Larian (Jess): I will fight them
Aldus Larian (Jess): "no one can insult me but me!"

N👌kri (Marisa): i like the shoes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Toga probably because i wont wanna change my make up and ill match reileys deku
N👌kri (Marisa): photoshoot idea:

4.) i stand on the katana pantsless while you continue holding it in the air
5.) take picture
N👌kri (Marisa): nothing could go wrong it's a flawless plan
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): step 4.5) turn off gravity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _for cosplay_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok time to go to the space station for a cosplay photo
N👌kri (Marisa): but we'd have to dress the space station up as the outside of a japanese school in late spring
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ok so I have Villain Toga, Formal Toga, lifeguard swimsuit stuff, Pyrrha, I need stuff for casual Pyrrha whoops, I’m butchering parts of cosplays for a rave outfit, Ochako
Bill: *Civvies and pajamas*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My civilian outfit is today lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And pajamas are in da laundry
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> <@!386874959009415170> I got an email about the Anyc rooms I booked... was anyone really interested in spending Saturday night in the city? It may be the precon anxiety for next but I’m not feeling taking ANYC from the day trip category. I may cancel them next week. (No pressure to agree, I can probably transfer rooms if it was to come to that).
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so you mean day trip ANYC rather than weekend trip?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think I’d just wanna day trip it assuming I can go
Bill: Yeah, though we never said for sure ANYC would be a weekend (sat-sun) to begin with; I just booked it cause there was availability and no down payment.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd honestly be fine with day trip. Would you be willing to let people sleep over at your place again?
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: ~~I have no idea what state the house will be in~~
Bill: But yeah.
Bill: Also you’re band is playing the weekend after, dodged a bullet there.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Did you guys take the train?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ferry
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ah okay Rutgers has a train from New Brunswick to that main train place under Madison square garden
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I’ll prob take that
Aldus Larian (Jess): day trip
Bill: Yeaaaah I’ll cancel those rooms next week.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I found something *a while back* for swim Kiri
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's a baby pool floaty but I might be able to cut off the arms and use the torso part as inflatable gears lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): although technically they're pink, but might be able to plastidip them red?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): are you doing kiri for CCE?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not doing y'all's GB group
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if that's still a thing
Kaio Vermino (Lee): its a thing, i didnt expect you to though xD but if you do kiri can we gets pics together if i do GB baku?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): also
Kaio Vermino (Lee): what the heck is that blow up thing im so confused
Kaio Vermino (Lee): how does that work xD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also yes absolutely
Kaio Vermino (Lee): OHHHHHH I SEE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Reading the description:
*Designed for kids up to 120 pounds.*

Pffft, yeah *OKAY*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea the ribbed part would work i think
Aldus Larian (Jess): Those types of floaties are usually one big compartment so that you only have one thing to.blow up so idk if you'd be able to cut it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it has 3 separate nozzles
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh welp carry on the. 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I did think about that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if it *is* one compartment, I could probably use an iron to melt an seal it and then cut the arms off
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nope, they're separate which is actually smart for safety reasons
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Should be good then
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ~~btw no pressure on the photos thing, but if we both end up in the costumes at the same time it'd be cool~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ~~but i also assume you wanna do it when the GB group isnt happening so you dont get roped into it somehow~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ~~mood~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol I'm sure there'll be a time we're both in costume
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): might bring full Kiri and get a photoshoot done
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ooooo
Kaio Vermino (Lee): the outside part of the kalahari is pretty cool
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I really liked the photos Rebecca and I got with Clouds last year
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so might hit Clouds up again
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea shes hella talented
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at least the Black Sun one was good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The IchiGoro was......
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ....awkward
Kaio Vermino (Lee): WELL
Kaio Vermino (Lee): .....yea
Bill: Hmm.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also not a fan of all the Kalahari signage in the background for those
Bill: I'm not a huge fan of Clouds, I think when it's not shopped a lot they're a bit weak.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yeaaa wavepool shots are hard to get right
Kaio Vermino (Lee): the giant kalahari sign is an eyesore
Bill: We need every for BNHA at some point cause Andrew's doing All Might... I'll have Fatgum and Kaminari.
Bill: I really need to shoot outside at Kalahari.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeeeeaaaahhhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): regular Fatgum or swim Fatgum?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or are you just saying in general? lol
Bill: In general.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👌
Bill: I dunno if there's a way to make swim fatgum a thing, he's too out there a character.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): gotta convince Tom to make Tamaki's hero suit so we can do internship arc stuff
Bill: ~~and also boi I'll shoot Kiri didn't we go over this at Zenkai?~~ At least in addition to.
Bill: Is clouds pricy?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not sure
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rebecca either footed the bill or got it for free for being friends or something idk
Bill: Maybe discount?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe
Bill: I feel like Clouds gets up there in cost.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): shes kinda pricey yea
Kaio Vermino (Lee): but she also shops like 6-8 photos
Bill: I vaguely remember the adds.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): and does like 1 or 2 composits
Kaio Vermino (Lee): sometimes
Bill: Her shops are pretty good.
Bill: Like that's worth the cost, no doubt.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea shes really good at it
Bill: I feel like she half asses some of Rebecca's photos though...
Bill: Always bugs me.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): if theyre free.................
Bill: fair, but I doubt they are.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i doubt rebecca pays 80 dollars for a shoot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): unless that's why she's always broke
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LOL
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oof
Bill: It's not the shops I'm talking about, some of her i think Blake shoots just look like Clouds put a purplish filter over her and called it a day and I was bothered by that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, this is one of my all time favorite photos
Kaio Vermino (Lee): YEA
Kaio Vermino (Lee): thats a GOOD one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): still upset I forgot my scarf.... BUT it still looks good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: Aaaah I hate the part where other people are at the con and I’m not!
Bill: ><
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that was me for CCE last year
Bill: I have a half day thursday of CCE, which I will "get up early" for so I can leave by 11 or 12.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I work a full day Thursday and drive up after work
