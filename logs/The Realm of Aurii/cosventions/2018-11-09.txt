Bill: Amazing.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's honestly super tempting because they're usually $200+

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): hhhhhhhhhhhhh
Bill: You have to get it home tho.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's only .3 pounds i could mail it for like $10 if needed <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Oh wow, light.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'm more worried about all the cosplay and junk ~~and books~~ i have. i have a lot of books and cookie tins aaaa, even when I try to keep it to rare or limited edition only. and pikachu dolls i have a ton of those but they're light. the cosplays get heavy when you put them all together but maybe i manage them. they were dirt cheap anyway.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): could also mail it directly to the US, I know shipping proxy services that are inexpensive
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do you have a costume in mind for it?

Bill: Also ye Violet.
Bill: Is Tomu still thinking of doing Benedict?

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Tom rev up those ruth and yoon cosplays
Bill: If you want to stay till monday we can try and figure something out... plus Andoru needs a ride too.
Bill: Where there's a will theres a way and all that bullshit.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Yeah i was tryna think about that. i'd like to stay until monday if possible but if andru's car can't get fixed then i'll head back up with someone sunday
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Or take the train for 8 hours
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the example birthday on this website is the same as my real birthday and it's freaking me out
Bill: I wanted to try Amtrak last year.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tom and I could always come down on our own i suppose
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): we'd have 6 train transfers
but riding together is half the fun don't sacrifice that
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): solution: we rent a party bus
Bill: !!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): katsu already costs an assload
Bill: Also true.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): $75 per person parking fee is daunting
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh yea i forgot about the parking
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think we paid 90 for the car last year
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): WHAT
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): per person?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no per car
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): o that's not so bad. maybe katsu has a discount. i know they do for artists and dealers.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): theres parking paid per person? that exists?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i used the nation harbor website
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): no like it gets split among the people. i've never driven outside of new jersey so every katsu i just pay my share of the parking bill

Bill: Marisa was she wouldn't stay till Monday *because* she'd drive home with you.
Bill: Otherwise she intends to.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Ooooooh
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Whoops
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I can drive her down then but not back I guess
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I shall save seat for her until we can figure it out
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we can figure out something!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): bless i am eternally grateful üôè
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'll of course pay whoever can take me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we just need to talk with everyone and plan out whos going with who and where and when lol
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): planning is daunting
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): TRU
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): right now its me, biru, tom, dave, marisa, andrew, gerogia?
Bill: Hal and Mak too.
Bill: But they're on their own as far as everything goes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean for cars anyway
Bill: Correct.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ya who cares about them ~~unless they have a free car~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): marisa and andrew are car-less yea?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i am. i haven't driven in a long time and i get petrified behind a wheel, plus i can't take the car from BoJo. andru has a car i think but it's broken?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ok so then we have georgis's truck, daves car, birus, car and mine and toms cars. 
In size/passenger order smol to lorge its:
My car/ toms car, Birus car, Daves car, and the gerogias truck
Bill: Georgia can't be relied on for anyone who wants to stay through monday.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yup
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i can't believe georgia drives an 18 wheeler
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is there anyone else who cant stay sunday night?
Bill: Andrew was on the fence with it, but wants to.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hmmm ok i think we gonna need 3 cars then
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz thats 6 people for the way home monday
Bill: Yeah, was a given. '
Bill: Which rather than the four sussex people and two southern people, it'll be a mix so Andrew and Marisa can get a ride.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEET
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ya i can get to andru's house
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive gotte like 15 followers this week wtf
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): e x p a n d
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my natural incliation is to say Biru/marisa/andrew and Me/tom/dave but:
that leaves gerogia all alone
and biru all alone for a CHONK of the ride
Bill: It's what makes the most sense yes.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if georgia is willing i could ride down with her but then i'd have to ride back with someone else
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Georgia also has most cargo room it its not raining
Bill: she has a cover for the back.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oof it's a 5+ hour drive for y'all right? i just tried to see if maybe i could go up to north jersey but that'd be backtracking by 2 1/2 hours and I don't want to make bojo go 5 hours roundtrip out of her way
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo yea dont do that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): someone will pick u up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we could technically all meet up at Andrews to redistribute cargo and passengers if we need to
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oo that's a good idea
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): that's a really good idea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz me, tom, Georgia and Marisa will all have alot of stuff
Bill: It's a little longer to go down by glassboro... I'd lean skipping that. Georgia would be adding significant time to go across state.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thena gain if we taking 3 cars there shouldnt be too much issue
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i can get squished in between stuff. when i drive with courtney i usually only take up half a seat and put luggage by my feet.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): MAWISA PLZ
Bill: you won't be doing that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we want u to be comfy
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): wouldn't you guys have to come across state to cross into delaware?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i squish
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): last time we crossed over up here and went down through PA
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ooooooooooooooo?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz roads are less busy
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ooo i see. google says right now that's longer
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i be spyin'
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): 
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the one that goes through PA is the 5h43m one unless you used another route which probably ya
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): O if you‚Äôre worried about me driving alone I could always ask Reiley or roman so that‚Äôs not a huge worry
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I just wanna make sure Marisa can commeeeee
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): me and tom sometime opt for slightly longer routes to save on driving stress
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOO ok good i dont want u too be lonely
Bill: meanwhile I prefer highways cause nyoom, so we're kinda opposites.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): [stuffs car with dakimakuras]
if you have a car phone charger we could have a speaker phone chat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont think the time diffence was that much last time though
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): last katsu we had like 3 cars in our caravan and we fell behind the other 2 and somehow wound up an hour and a half ahead of them
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ok im gonna say the split that makes most sence is Marisa/Biru/Andrew Me/Tom/Dave and Georgia and friends for sure then
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Biru, were you planing on working thursday?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if we do that i can torture biru and andru by making them converse in japanese
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Bill: ~~I didn't want to go to Katsu anyway~~
Bill: I don't know, probably work half day.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): are y'all planning on thursday badge pickup or friday?
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Thursday assuming I can make it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I prob can my latest class is at 4 I think
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): you might be cutting it close but i think katsu's reg goes late so should be ok
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah until 11pm
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): then opens again at 8am fri
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): So I could prob get there by 9
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Holla
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im planning on a half day rn
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): prob be there about 7ish?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Biru if you can think of a config that makes more sense im open to it this is just what seems most logical
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): my arda wig just shipped
Bill: No, it's what I figured as well.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i hope my wig ships today tooooo
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): we ordered it minutes apart so it should! ya?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ü§û
