Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I know that tier included derps so it could be similar to that bambiskii girl I follow but like, paid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Cuter, sexier, derpier"
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yo ive been following her ever since you poster her in here last time and its been a blessing
Aldus Larian (Jess): Those are supposed to be derpy?
Bill: I think you had to swipe on the post for derp version?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye she puts a derp at the end
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Some more derpy than others
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But she's heckin' cute
Aldus Larian (Jess): Neat stichwork? I don't know her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): As long as it passes the 5 foot rule
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But also it's critically in character for Seven
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Looks good üëåüèª
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea you can't really notice it from a distance
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye I didn't knife what you meant until I click the full image
Bill: cause of the focus being on the tip of the gun, this almost looks like a game still. That's neet.
Bill: Nice Tom.

ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): the over teh shoulder shots i like alot as well
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): and also tbh just the dark picture of the door
Bill: Oh ye. I gotta post some of those, dunno if you wanna do edits first, or if you aren't planning on doing anything with them at all?
Aldus Larian (Jess): *Yeet*
Bill: That's an actual question <@!351785752197201920> , if you aren't going to do anything with those shots I pulled my favorites and would do some post before posting, but I want to give you the chance to do the whole photographer thing if you wanted to.
Aldus Larian (Jess): He busy atm
Bill: He'll see it later then.
Bill: Sorted through Otakon. While there's a lot I'm very unimpressed with, Kiri was a good shoot and there's a few nice ones here and there. Don't think I had the light as figured out as I thought I did. üòÖ
Bill: I live in constant fear my photos always look the one on other people‚Äôs screens.

Aldus Larian (Jess): Im having an argument with myself cuz i really want to cosplay Drizzt to the Ren Fair but CCE's hotel is running us over 300 and its probably not responsible for me to get the stuff for him plus i still need a few more things for CCE and aaaahhhhh
Bill: I have enough room to set up the backdrop kit I got with the first set of lights I bought.
Bill: Too bad the backdrop itself is shit.
Bill: 
Bill: Shame.
Bill: If anyone sees a bolt of black, not sheer fabric on sale somewhere though, I at least have something to hold it up. ~~maybe, the stands are hollow aluminum~~
Bill: Gotta check the green and white sheets too but I don‚Äôt expect better.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): You could prob get a black blackout curtain big enough for cheap
Bill: Ye. If I happen to see one, I‚Äôm not super worried about having a backdrop lol
Bill: Figured it‚Äôd be neat to take photos of me. I‚Äôve got the space to set up lights to do it XD
Bill: How much do you need for Drittz Jess? Or is anything borrowable?
Aldus Larian (Jess): not really its all like armor pieces i have some of it but i would prob be like 60-130 depending on how crazy i go
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Who is drittz?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): He's a dark elf from the Legend if drizzt book series
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ohhhhh
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Based in DND realm
Nokri (Marisa): <:rapid:607237006539489310> <:pwease:555585508819075112>

Bill: Would you rewear Drizzt?
