N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): AAAAAAAAAA
Elfriede Faun (Tom): CINNOMAN DULCE COFFEE
Aldus Larian (Jess): I WANT DAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): WE GOTTA GO TO THE UK TO SEE DOLCE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THE REAL DOLCE
Bill: *who wants to come over and see if these fancy led light bulbs will make for kickass photatos*
Bill: Actually pretty hype to see what they look like without a sunlit window.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wooo
Bill: ~~there’s a cherry blossom tint~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Are they those color changing lights?
Bill: yup. RGB Led.
Bill: Phone controlled.
Bill: Bunch of programming options too.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): When I move out and get other lighting fixtures, I want to get those. My friend has them and they're neat
Bill: They were on sale and I had one dead bulb so like why not.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Alexa, turn my bedroom lights red like the fires of hell*
Bill: This integrated to siri so I can do some of that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Most of the smart bulbs are capable of connecting to home assistants
Bill: Dad: “now I’d be impressed if they can react to music”
Me:
Bill: 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Well huh
Bill: It’s kinda shitty.
Bill: And can’t integrate with Sonos. That’s the real dealbreaker.
Bill: but this exists
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like saying "Alexa, change lights to sexy time" would kind of kill the mood
Bill: What if it’s sexy time with Alexa.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Out of all the photos of me you guys took. The candid of me messing with Georgia is probably the most technically sound. 

*It's probably cause Georgia was in the frame too*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What defines “technically sound”
Bill: Focus. For some reason quite a few of the ones of my face aren't that 'pore viewing' sharp they should have been. Couldn't tell you why, camera shake maybe, or I moved?
Bill: I posted em, idk, just. That one looks more... good. Maybe cause I'm very rarely candid.
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> <@!334090409389195266> <@!350855105123319808>
Bill: It's the perfect ad for SCCC I swear.
Tikur (Kurtis): 👌👌👌👌👌👌
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AGHHHH
Bill: So what tag is he following cause that was less than 10 seconds after posfing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think he got the reference...
Bill: It’s okay, post engagement.
Bill: Interestingly.
Bill: The tint of the led bulbs is entirely modeled in the white balance axis.
Bill: Which means, I could create the same tint on a normal photo if I moved the two sliders about correct.
Bill: As RAW images allow you to use any white balance even after the shot is taken.
Bill: And. Their. Regular lightbulbs, so they barely light the room (photographically) as is, you make them a dull color and up the iso goes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yukata came in
Bill: I like it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The marerial is pretty nice
Aldus Larian (Jess): NICU 👌
Bill: Katy's been talking to someone about steelstacks since I mentioned it at one point. It's near where her new apartment will be, and she says whoever she talked to was about to get to the factory parts.
Bill: All signs point to that being a great Nier shoot spot.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The the instructions for the belt are in Japanese (I managed to figure it without them though) but I thought I'd try the Google Translate camera feature. It's by no means perfect, but the fact that it can sort of translate it is really cool
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: Giant OF
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's really finicky and changes a lot
Bill: Eastern languages are a mess, cause they have their own logic pattern to speaking that's different than the romance languages.
Bill: Japanese in particular allows you drop large parts of sentences, assuming you'll figure out subject via context.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *sauce of the knot*
Bill: Sauce of the knot? *Is it a naughty knot*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok when you actually take the photo and let it do its thing, it's a lot better
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: *umbilical region*
Bill: Yooooo SHITTTTT all red light definitely makes my room look like a murder den.
Bill: Or.
Bill: A dark room, actually.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Have that on while editing photos to pretend like you're developing them
Bill: I mean. It’s just like that.
Bill: Pretty freaking cool.
Bill: Also look what it does to my holo print.
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's so edgy
Bill: is V unknown.
Aldus Larian (Jess): No he is not 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): They are two different people
Bill: man, if I wasn't a lazy fuck I could get my V wig and my grandfather's camera and look authentic as fuck right now.
