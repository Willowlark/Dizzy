N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t think any rooms have microwaves but all rooms have fridges
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): solid
N🆗ri (Marisa): Why do so many people sound so self righteous
Chill bro
Andrew: Hey look me.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): instagram famous greg joseph gotta know
Andrew: But I thought someone said saturday for FE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!351471675843411978> can you also pack that blue tank top you said you had?
Andrew: 
Andrew: She posted this before he posted that
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe the group is separate from the meetip
Andrew: 
Andrew: Evidence
N🆗ri (Marisa): That happened once when I ran the SAO meetup. I saw two Asunas waiting around the meetup location and I was like “hey you guys here for the photoshoot?” And they were like “...yeah?” And looked at me weird and I was like “cool!” And walked away

And then they disappeared and they came back later saying “omg we had a private shoot we didn’t realize you were talking about a big photoshoot”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh ye I got u
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oof zenkai plz come faster
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): another internship rejection email today

Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmfao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye it ok
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): rejection sucks but nasa is still in the running
Elfriede Faun (Tom): oo should post a pic from the mysmess shoot
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Someday...z....z.zzzzzzz
N🆗ri (Marisa): **wake up**
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wake him up
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh i just saw that photo scott tagged me
he didn't mention me as photographer though i'm just randomly tagged in it
should i say something
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it worthy saying anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Scott's not doing so good at this social media thing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Or just social thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): yyyeah. it's bothering me but i don't want to start any beef.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it doesn't make sense to tag me in the pic since my insta is purely for my cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): so people would just see it and be like "huh?"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~cant wake up~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): before you go go
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo he posted it in his story maybe i can message him there. is that out of line
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh he didn't credit me for my hammer this time <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't really care too much but like brah
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was so busy backing honey butter chips I forgot to pack my shoes
Aldus Larian (Jess): Priorities
N🆗ri (Marisa): i normally wouldn't care so much - i never really did before when my friends post stuff without credit - but for some reason it's really bothering me this time <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
you worked so hard on hammer
N🆗ri (Marisa): eat the chips and wear the wrapper
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea cuz he was a butt about getting photos back
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah it ok as long as no one's like "hey man great job in that hammer" and he's like "oh thanks"
N🆗ri (Marisa): "Hey! I really appreciate the post, I'm super glad you're enjoying the pictures! ^u^ Would it be okay to credit me in the description rather than the image? Otherwise no one would really know why I"m tagged ^^;"
is that too much
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can throw in a hammer jab
Aldus Larian (Jess): I would just end it after image but that's just me
N🆗ri (Marisa): my phone's not turning on anyway lol rip
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): DO IT MAWISA send it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then if he's like "oh why?" Than you can explain it doesn't make sense to be tagged since u are a cosplayer
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean that it's your cosplay account as opposed to a photographer account
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo my phone is back
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz u not only a cosplayer I was just referring to your account
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee very wise words thank u
N🆗ri (Marisa): do u think he's mad that i ruined his alone time with starryshyroo hehe
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol of he is too bad she has a boifren

N🆗ri (Marisa): have you tried using that power in casinos
Aldus Larian (Jess): It fine
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh Tom's doesn't believe in gambling
N🆗ri (Marisa): does he believe in the ogopogo
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEEE BLESS
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Packing wasn't actually too too bad for me just took forever 2 of my characters have no props or accessories so that was easy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I packed the smaller things in ziplocks. It's just a matter of putting everything in the suitcase and tetrising it around
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and making sure I have normal clothes and toiletries and whatnot
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah that's exactly where I'm at too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 🙏
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cosplay first
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Then basic necessities
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Priority
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i THINK i'm all packed.... but somehow 4 bags doesnt seem like enough
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): after katsucon now im like 👀 girl you better pack extra
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow *only* 4 bags
Elfriede Faun (Tom): All depends on number of shoes fam
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OOF SHOES
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so many shoes, thats one bag itself
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had an entirely separate duffel bag specifically for shoes for Katsu
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably will again for Zenkai but it won't have quite as many
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Shoes are indeed the biggest of oofs
Aldus Larian (Jess): i somehow fit my shoes in my regular clothes bag this time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yep i have a duffel bag of shoes for zenkai xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ozmas boots are the biggest culprit
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oo are they big Bois?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea they long bois
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and the thotsma shoes are chonk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have both Blake's and Kiri's boots
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): both long bois
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): long AND chonk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Aldus Larian (Jess): i need to remeber to pack my slippers
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Good idea
Bill: next year, I think I'm going to half day Zenkai. It's worth it so I can visit the archery shop in landcaster before the con.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You'll prob end up going over by yourself then
N🆗ri (Marisa): I really like this dress I hope no one sees how trashy it is
Bill: SO CUTE

Bill: block him yada yada yada.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’d be like you blocking hunter tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just ghost him then
Bill: I don't go on invisible to avoid Hunter.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah but you’re in the same group chat. I share three chats with him.
Bill: I complain about my disagreements with Hunter, but you don't complain, you actively avoid talking to him.
Bill: That is different.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ghost ghost ghost!
Bill: *I read this joke and thought “V, cosplaying Pilot boi”
Bill: So how blind is V before I bust myself as a casual saying he’s totally blind but he’s only like 75% or something?
Aldus Larian (Jess): he can "see a little from his left eye" is what he says in main story
Aldus Larian (Jess): so yea hes not completely blind
Bill: But like. Not enough to photograph anymore I guess?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know? i think he photographs mc and jumins wedding but i cant remember for sure
Aldus Larian (Jess): the wiki says:  Due to being a victim of domestic violence committed by his fiancé, Rika, V's eyes are hurt badly, resulting a severe corneal damage from external trauma that almost blind him
Bill: Yeee so I guess he not blind blind.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao i was going through my old screenshot trying to find V being an absolute savage in jumin route but i cant find it i did however find a treasure trove of mystic memes
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg i took so screenshots of this game its like a live tweet record
N🆗ri (Marisa): V stopped taking pictures after damaging his eyes I think <:thinku:543194478614413318> or at least is on photo hiatus
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~v blinded himself by taking pictures of the literal sun~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think that exactly what happened but yea it prob didnt help tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have so many screenshot that i was gonna use as reaction images
N🆗ri (Marisa): If titans is at 11 tomorrow I may only be able to shoot for like 20 minutes. They’re saying we start work at noon tomorrow but that’s not what they said before so I’m gonna check again but heads up sowwy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pls post all the screenshots
N🆗ri (Marisa): Noon to 9pm and then 9am to 7pm can’t be right.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I WANNA GO TO ZENKAI NOAW
Bill: SAME
Bill: So I have this thin plasticky shell for a reflector.
Bill: The shell has a loop, which I ran through a strap on the back of the camera. But it dangly.
Bill: You think if I cut strap slits in the shell it would start to fall apart?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): however you can superglue a strap to it
Bill: I dunno if I have anything I can use a strap and MAYBE have an old bottle of super glue in the basement.
Bill: Will duct tape stick to the plastic.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not sure
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): depends on the plastic i think
Bill: Not my crappy duct tape.
Bill: Might have to deal with dangly boi this weekend. ~~Don't bring up that I never use reflectors at shoot~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol dangly boi
Bill: This one doesn't have a white side, which sucks, but it smaller and can (theoretically) by bound to the backpack out of the way and I like it.
Bill: The other one I just don't use.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~dangly boi is what i can peen~~
Bill: ~~yes that wasn't hard to figure out~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I can’t use context clues to figure out this conversation
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And all I see is peen
