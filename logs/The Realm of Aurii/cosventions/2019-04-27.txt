Bill: If there was meeting time decided I dunno, but I’m heading there. Probably be there 9:30 10ish.
Bill: Gotta stop for Starbucks to survive this morning.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Georgia is getting up at 9, then we all saying goodbye to Ethan and Casey, then were getting ready and heading over

Bill: Best of luck.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Donuts rose us from the dead
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Georgia is alive
Bill: Must be some strong donuts.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i need to get ready why he talkin_
Bill: *because you invited him in*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wasn't he supposed to leave half an hour ago?
Bill: It’s a trap.gif
Bill: Pre reg line is outside and the window is a chilly boi. And I’m not even the bunny bnha group.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Weren't they supposed to leave 45 minutes ago <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: <:then_perish:554720548274569246>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *WE SURVIVED*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Leanna and Georgia are still getting ready
Bill: No rush. Pre reg is slow as fuck.
Bill: As a reminder the escape phrase is Applebee’s reservation and I say so cause OOF Tobias is here.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ahhh tobias.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Probably good I’m not there. He would follow me for so many hours all the time. <:lenny:395307171539189760> watch yer backs
Bill: He’s like “I know you, but I forget your name”. So I say Bill. He’s like “last name”. And I’m like Clark. Then he’s like “froommm...”
Bill: You clearly don’t know me guy.
Bill: Then preceded to tell me about how he had to leave Rowan for psychological reasons, his therapist fucked up his meds and he was hospitalized.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I “mmhm”’d him until I finished attaching my bag and said “gotta go”.
Bill: If an N cosplayer starts talking to you girls, run. Hell, Erik too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh he left? I wonder if it had anything to do with Japanese culture club. We were running errands (Daiva and tiny kaichou and I and a few other girls I can’t remember who) and he came up to talk to us and someone completely shut him down
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah don’t try to engage him for long. He would see me walking to 7/11 in between classes, say hi, then follow me for three hours while I shopped, ate, and tried to do homework
Bill: Oh I know he a creep.
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’d start bringing his laptop to show me the jmmorpg he was playing to learn Japanese but he didn’t really use it to learn, he just kind of remembered where the necessary buttons were to play the game without reading them
N🆗ri (Marisa): ‘‘Tis a warning to the others
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s not creepy, he just will not let you go ever.
Bill: He’s creepy Marisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is he?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Creeps are more like, people who you get a gut feeling that you don’t want to be around them. You feel like running and you feel unsafe. 
Tobias was more like a nuisance (which sounds really mean and horrible but I’m used to being alone all the time). After a week of following me around he said he thought I was highly autistic like him and that we could bond over it. 

He’s more annoying than creep unless he’s evolved in the years since I last saw him.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Though I’m also the worst judge of character <:thinku:543194478614413318> I thought Sean was ok until he started with the super inappropriate jokes every time I ran into him, and him telling me “you must be super drunk right now, see you at my hentai panel”
Bill: We have different sensors I suppose.
Bill: *ugh* it’s been so long since I did Hall shots I’m like, anxious about it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Walk up and say “pwease May I get a pwictuwe pwease uwu”
Bill: What am I Tobias.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just make sure you don’t invite yourself to follow them for 10 hours afterwards
Bill: Thiiiink I saw one of the twins Georgia.
Bill: > ask for photo
> take photo 
> ???
> make friend 

That missing step seems to be important.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Post cosplay selfies
