Bill: Alright. I think I know what I need to do start enjoying shooting more. 

1. Don't settle on a nice location. May not matter to cosplayer, but does to me.
2. No more than 4 people to a shoot. More people, less time to work on quality for everyone, group shots suck.My best work is almost always solos.
3. Don't just shoot it because I got asked; not shooting does not make me not friends with them and in the off chance it does, they're shitstains anyway.
4. Shoot either something I enjoy cosplay wise, or with a person I enjoy people wise. 
5. I'm not on a quest to fill slots, if I have time to kill that's coo. 
*6. People asking for shoots is not a thing to make friends, I should ask if I want to spend a shoot with someone not hope they choose me*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Y E A H

Bill: You mean Star guardian.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye

N🆗ri (Marisa): Yes yes we can
Bill: No idea what happening with Hazel/Barry cause Chinese New Year means they got off like, all of Feburary.
Bill: Definitely skipping formal I think. I'd rather rave or hang with the ghillies.
Bill: Whose the guy who cosplays background character? I forget his name.
Bill: He had said I (and Georgia) should join them at Zenkai.
Erik: Oooh I think he just friended me on Facebook
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i want to see drunk ghillie bill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this is something the world needs now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think rave is saturday night?
Erik: *Ghillie Billy*
Bill: probably. These days I assume every con has friday and saturday. Saturday is always better.
Erik: *Ghilliam*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GHILLIE BILLY
Bill: The fuck is the guy's name, I don't want to ask Gen and Chris cause awkward.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): josh?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats what my brain is telling me off the bad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE I WAS RIGHT
Bill: Got em
Erik: 
Bill: ~~and then all of BNE crashes the Ghillies~~
Bill: *2011, Cosmo Shop*
Leanna: I should a been in cosmo
Bill: ~~time to make this into a million memes <@!350855105123319808>
Bill: Magic Head
Leanna: Bill you have payback for your face meme now
Tikur (Kurtis): The payback begins
Bill: 
Bill: Kurtis *is* the meme.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he looks like a new york times reporter from the 1940s
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YOURE NEVER GONNA BELIEVE THE SCOOP, JERRY
Bill: 
Leanna: Kurtis IS the meme
Leanna: You're right
Tikur (Kurtis): 😎👉👉
Bill: Not one to be upstaged...
Leanna: Oooooooooof
Leanna: I hate everything
Leanna: Please meme me
Bill: Marisa be the meme agent. Make as many memes as you possible can.
Bill: "look kids, death is fun!"
Bill: "Oh god, they actually offed themselves"
Leanna: HELP IM FUCKING DYING
Bill: *Actually the plan, invited you to Aurii to make you cry (in amusement) every day*
Tikur (Kurtis): QUALITY 👌
Bill: Why are you so in sync. *Oh wait*
Bill: ~~This was your second date somehow~~
Leanna: STOP
Bill: 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that looks like a cover of an album
Leanna: why cant me and kurtis take a single decent photo
Aldus Larian (Jess): too much meme
Aldus Larian (Jess): meme king and meme queen
Leanna: Holy fuck lmao
Bill: These were all test shots, he said on the ride down you'd both be unable to stop memeing, and I'm only sharing the quality meme shit?
Bill: *but also yes you're disgusting memes and I love you*
Leanna: He was right
Leanna: BIG YIKES LMAO
Bill: We'll see if you can manage to not to it Zenkai.
Bill: *Couple cosplay is going to be a thing right*
Leanna: 100% not possible
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Leanna: not that I know of
Bill: *If not Roman Torchwick and Neo like, Blue and Chris Pratt*
Leanna: Unless kurtis pulls a secret cosplay out his ass
Leanna: That would be impressive actually
Bill: *Please don't give him ideas*
Tikur (Kurtis): * laughs in hidden *
Leanna: *eyebrow wiggles*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): roman isnt for zenkai?
Tikur (Kurtis): Oh he is
Leanna: ~~I no longer fit into regular neo.... unless I use my binder~~ might just be some crack ships LMAO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO CRACK SHIPS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): never 4get... when hal and i cosplayed yang and tai
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and it was a WEIRD DA
Leanna: OH YEA THAT WAS WEIRD
Aldus Larian (Jess): LOL I FEEL YOU
Aldus Larian (Jess): when me ant tom did seven and saeran i was like "oh no"
Bill: Ah yes. Valid excuses to snark about couples.
Bill: Oh wait. You wanna run a MM shoot at Zenkai?
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah
Aldus Larian (Jess): running shoots doesnt interest me right now
Bill: I’d help, if it was an issue of being the talky person. Mmkay tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg how could I have forgotten
the most perfect cosplay
i'm gonna do Red Blood Cell at zenkaikon
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe for saturday
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's perfect for staffing in
N🆗ri (Marisa): i could run a mm shoot at zenkai but it'd have to be friday morning
N🆗ri (Marisa): or late saturday night
N🆗ri (Marisa): actual pic of me praying for reduced staffing hours
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/0f/43/880f4306c7ce1ad161e7194f278022aa.gif
Bill: I don't know which is you.
Bill: But I'm the other one.
N🆗ri (Marisa): imma be red blood cell
Bill: I'm white blood cell then.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wat does this meeeaaaan
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 🤷
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i got that too  XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): http://www.babynamescube.com/qeseng-name-meaning
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i never get comment on insta, but when i do, i cant understand then
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I never get comment on insta, but when I do it's "Hey do you want to be a promoter?"
Bill: I did a handful of photos for Richard at Katsu, while we were waiting for Monica's ~~group~~ Weiss. He told me when I sent it to him he won't be at Zenkai. 😭
Bill: Awkward given what Hunter said, but I was also going to suggest a late shoot for Lux. Remember when I showed you light writing? The staff would be good for that.
Bill: What's happening with Raven/Starfire?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im not even positive im doing raven yet, im going to ry
Bill: Mmkay.
Bill: Okay. In the past, spacing shoots out always sucked cause I'd start to relax and chat and then have to leave pretty soon after. But I also don't relax and chat when I do a 4 shoot binge.
Bill: 5, usually.
Bill: Zenkai is weird cause it's not a busy con, and I enjoy the just fucking around on the con floor part. So have a schedule for it would be bleh.
Bill: Maybe I should just. Yolo. The whole con.
Bill: That's how summer lovin came about at Ota.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Should I make terra anyway because she’s really easy and if you don’t finish raven I can bring her to another con
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~can also bring raven parts to zenkai~~
Bill: Did you do Raven?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve cosplayed raven yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): But I don’t want to take Jess’s spot
Bill: course not. You a good bean.
Bill: And Terra was a great idea.
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT IS THIS DARK MAGIC
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hashtag emoji erasure trending 2k19
Bill: How do I socialize all day at Zenkai while also doing shoots. This. eyuck.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Schedule max 4 shoots a day and do them in sets of 2?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I socialize while photoshooting. Business talk. 
Georgia is very good she has a high resistance and keeps her face straight while I talk
Bill: I do too, I just don't want to have to leave a conversation I'm enjoying to go to another booking.
N🆗ri (Marisa): bring them along
N🆗ri (Marisa): big party
Bill: They usually go do something more fun for them lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think booking any shoots this becomes inevitable
Bill: Might have the right idea though Georgia... two morning shoots, leave the main chunk of the day clear, shoot another two around golden hour. ~~actually golden hour was crap last year iirc, so maybe a bit before that~~
Bill: It sort of does. I could just fuck around and plan the shoots on the fly?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Eh but then you might not get around to some shoots
Bill: Right now not much I'm beheld to. Lux, if you wanted...
Aldus Larian (Jess): just do what you what you wanna do
Bill: I wanna do *everything* tho lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): dont schedule shoots if u dont wanna be on a shedule
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> how long are you available for friday morning?
N🆗ri (Marisa): hewwo das me
staffing starts 1pm so if i'm in any costume that i can't be staffing in I'd have to change at 12:30 at the latest
Bill: I like my 11am "warmup" shoots, so whatever form of teen titans can be friday morning warm up... Yang for saturday warm up?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye sounds good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 11 am both days?
Bill: I suppose. Could do earlier, if we leave the room earlier.
Bill: ,... fuck it I'll just wing plan versus free wheeling versus whatever. I'm overthinking it. Lemme know about Lux.
Bill: When people decide what they're doing I'll make the time as I want.
Bill: Like Gen's castlevania group, grabbed that cause Castlevania is AWESOME.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lux is good after 4:30 boiiii
Bill: That when you changing?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeee
Bill: Lemme think.. so Leanna, you picked up from Jason that going somewhere dark helped show off the LEDs. Which makes sense, less light pollution. Where in the Zenkai area is pretty dark in the evening?
Bill: Not... too many places, really.
N🆗ri (Marisa): everywhere
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Brick hallway?
Bill: That leads to that resturant entrance right? It probably has lights.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the con gets pretty dark at night
N🆗ri (Marisa): i did a sailor moon group shoot and couldn't find any decently lit spots within the con center
Bill: What about that park we did RWBY in?
Bill: That might work.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im not excited for how much colder senkai will be this yr
Aldus Larian (Jess): or will probably be
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LEDs will show up better just in general
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have EL wire and EL paneling
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which gives off a glow effect
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so for me it had to be like...almost completely dark with minimal flash
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LEDs are a LOT brighter though so you could get away with probably a dim room or area
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): maybe an alley?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i'm prob gonna wear penny to the rave though~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~whenever that is~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’d prob wear Yang’s tank top, shorts, and skirt thing with converse
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dunno if I wanna go tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea im still not sure if i'll go.... i usually don't enjoy raves
Bill: True. We'll run with it. I assume you'd like some daylight photos, we can do those golden hour then transition into figuring out what do with light writing.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i wanna find a way to show off penny's lights >.>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So what time would that be Bill?
Bill: Rave'll be better than string quartet formal <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm kind of in the boat of "want to take a break from formals and check out the rave, but not sure if I'll stay or enjoy it"
Bill: Alcohol helps with the rave.
Bill: ALot.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Both both both both
Bill: I can't dance without being drunk.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): are they the same day?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Friday formal Saturday rave
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/spongegar-funny-blink-gif-7390773
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): catra for ball i guess then
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is saturday the main rwby day?
Bill: yeah.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): okie dokie.... guess i'll just do ozma and penny that day then
Bill: Also need to know when the ghillies are out. I think it's friday.
Bill: Rave is usually two nights, if ghillies is sat I'mma rave friday probs.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaaaaa ok i wanna join ghilies
Bill: ~~But do we need a *whole* BNE event tho~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~ngl, i might ditch for real food and then come back to hang out with them. i dont wanna get sick lmaoooooo~~
Bill: we can order from a local place rather than Dominos.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im more so worried about other congoers being like 😮 pizza party?????
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and then we get ....bombarded
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I was thinkin that too
Bill: We can hopefully find an out of the way area. Reg IS usually empty in the evening.
Bill: And we've got enough people to intimidate off vultures.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): word travels fast when theres food involved
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah they have that area in the middle of the lobby with all those tables and chairs and we can just commandeer a spot and if other con-goers are like *OwO Pizza?!?!?* we can just be like, *sorry, this is not an open invite for pizza*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it ok Leanna we can have a chilis date :V
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): CHILIS DATE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that chicken pasta is calling my name
N🆗ri (Marisa): I spoke with BoJo and she said the hours I was went were not reflective of the hours I’d be working, I’d only work when the dealers hall is open. 
But I’d still really like to join if even like one person would hang around until after 7 ;u;
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~can I third wheel Chili's date because I want real food too~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t need food I just want friendship ;u;
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes please third wheel and then we can come back and kidnap marisa for friendship and kigu party
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I should really get a kigu~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): every weeb is required to own one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I want to get the red dragon one Meg has for Kirishima, but they don't have it on Amazon and I think I found it on another site but it's $76
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Guess I'm getting a black cat one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wait so are people serious about chilis
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause I would actually
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean an Uber for 10 mins away spot 3 ways ain’t bad
Bill: Depending. We’ll be shooting still at like 8.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O yeah what time did you wanna actually shoot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I know you’re trying to “as it comes” thing but georgia is definitely schedule driven oof
Bill: And on how many people. I like small groups, not all of the possible people. ~~I fade into the background with groups~~
Bill: Sundown is 7:20. So we’d need time on either side of that, if you wanted normal Lux photos too. So 6:30~8?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I should try... to plan zenkai
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk why, its stressing me
Bill: And right now I’m scheduling. I think what I’ll do is leave the afternoon free to do whatever happens.
Bill: Same tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm serious about chilis too ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if i dont eat actual food i get really sick at cons, so actually having dinner is the plan for me either way xD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I could do chili’s at 8 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I really just need restaurant food by Saturday night given my tendency not to eat
Bill: ~~maybe but yes~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But all the places nearby are gonna be packed or 21+ soon after
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im down with chilis at 8
Bill: Aurii to chilis sounds decent. Dunno how it’ll time with the ghillies.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we can come back and ghillie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Eh they’ll be fuckin around all night I think
Bill: Probably.
Bill: But it gets harder to be drunk hyper after awhile. It’s okay tho.
Bill: So let the pizza thing fade away in BNE, pick it up as a kigu party later, or just leave it and ghillies up.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeep
Bill: Friday will be dances.
Bill: Thursday boudoir?
Bill: ~~not that Thursday boudoir went well at Katsu but~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah I gotta know when to bring my lawn chair and sign
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh fuck i forgot, i better brush yangs wig
N🆗ri (Marisa): i should be free all thursday i can do that
Bill: I don’t think I’ll be there till like, 7 or 8 so...
Bill: Speaking of, carpooling.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait. all staff meeting at like 10pm or something thursday. i gotta do that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a team meeting at 10 and then i dunno what time the all staff meeting is but if you get to the con before then i can do it
N🆗ri (Marisa): if not it can be done another night
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think im doing half day thursday for zenkai. i cant remember
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im off from school that week sO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's a 40 minute drive for me so I guess I have time until you guys get there lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea im doing half day
Bill: Oh you are?
Bill: Ah gotcha.
Bill: Yeah, I only took half days for Katsu and Ota.
Bill: But with working from home I can bullshit stuff.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): uber from con to chilis is 11 dollars
Bill: I'm guessing you'll need two but it's a moot point. easy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): pack it in like a clown car
Bill: Georgia, are you going to go there yourself?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): uhmmm i dont think theres any better option
Bill: Coming to me adds time, it's like an extra hour. Maybe you could meet up with Leanna, she probably on the way you usually take.
Bill: Although I know Kurtis mentioned wanting to go with Leanna, he probably hasn't figured out if that's possible yet, sweet bean.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i high key have anxiety driving other people around, especially past dark~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ill drive leanna
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its just boring being alone
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): alright fam lmao, my eyesight is bad and the dark makes it worse
Bill: But with Leanna I'd also assume you're waiting till after quitting time as well.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean i can drive alone, i visited hal for a year and a half and thats a 2 hour drive alone lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i get off at 4
Bill: But no one ever wants to it, it's lonely ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so any time after 4
Bill: Check with Kurto too. Dunno if he has plan.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye ill ask
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i just feel bad cause its like ....out of his way, i think
Bill: *He is a good boi who wants to drive with you, that's all he sees*
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> I assume us three? Justin and Rayna are coming friday iirc so moot, no Dave, Kurto is a toss up.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): how beautifully wholesome 😭
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is dave not coming at all?
Bill: Nah. He likes the bigger cons.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ah ok, thats a mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whats the sleeping situation looking like?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we have 2 rooms right?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how many people?
Bill: I gotta get lunch with team, so discuss later.
Bill: 12 people.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): okie dokie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 12 people, 4 beds, +at least my air mattress
Bill: ~~Zenkai so close to Katsu is stressful~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes it is... put it back
N🆗ri (Marisa): we're down 30% of attendees from last year hhh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no :c
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): based on pre reg?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): realistically all the couples will get a bed prob
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so tom/jess, leanna/kurtis, justin/rayna
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): bill gets bed cause he paid for room, prob shared with andrew
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was kind assuming it would be you me tom and kurtis
Aldus Larian (Jess): for driving
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye based on current registrants
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i still have ptsd from losing my car last year and would prefer to carpool with whoever wants to LMAO~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): which for air mattress #1 leaves me, erik, tristan, john, and one more?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can do my air mat and sleeping bag
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): andrew and bill might share a bed based on bill sharing with dave at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kk so ill share with tristan
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): erik has his
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): k cool everyone has sleep space
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~damn hal, now hes yeeted away i dont get bed priority at cons anymore~~
Bill: I don’t think couples should get priority to be honest. I don’t think it’s fair.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean i know i have a pretty good back so i can stand sleepin on an air mattress
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like i said, i just hate lugging the damn thing
Bill: I can’t decide on a fair rotation method or the like for it is all.
N🆗ri (Marisa): random generator go
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i don't mind sleeping on air mattresses, or not having bed priority so, it's whatever ya'll want. i have a smaller twin size air mattress i can bring if we need it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *kigu acquired*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~*it has no reviews on Amazon so we'll see how it is*~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which one did you get
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if you got a typically tall animal im gonna laugh
N🆗ri (Marisa): giraffe?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wanted a tiger but I didn't like the tiger ones I found but then I found Tigger and *allegedly* the XL fits up to 6'11"
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so we'll see
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO KIGU PARTY
Bill: Maybe I will do a lotto for the three beds?
N🆗ri (Marisa): sell raffle tickets
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _gotta use the luck_
Aldus Larian (Jess): If its that big of deal tom and i can just start getting our own rooms
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i feel it's not as big of a deal as we're making it~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): could just ask the group as a whole who cares about where they sleep, i think most people don't care as long as they have a room and either a bed or air mattress
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i know i personally don't care, just that i'd prefer to be in a bed with someone i already know (ex: anyone in this chat)
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't mean to be like drama queen, i just have a bad back and im shot after one or two nights on an air mattress, which makes me very non fun to be around and the main reason i con is for fun
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): valid
Bill: It's just something I think about. It's not as big a deal as it's sounding, I just try and do right by people.
Bill: Why Tristan is coming to start with.
N🆗ri (Marisa): people would fight over beds in courtney's room so she does it first-come first-serve via whoever pays her first
Bill: That kinda bullies out people based on income.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and we usually dont know the spilt till late in the game
Bill: True true.
Bill: Plus I never ask for money ahead of time.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye people in her room were just being immature neeners about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): from what i can tell, this group seems like pacfists who dont really wanna fight about beds
Bill: ~~They were kinda weird~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so i can't imagine it would come to that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Bill: Yes, I just don't want anyone to go 'suffer in silence'.
Bill: If there was a request I want to hear it, not have them assume they'd be causing trouble by asking.
N🆗ri (Marisa): smother each other with pillows in the night to establish who gets the bed
Bill: That's where I'm coming from.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea we wont fight. We'llpay extra, or help with deposits or move to our own room. I just can't justify paying to be somewhere to have fun and then be in pain all weekend
Bill: And I certainly want you to keep staying with us because you precious friends and the people I room with are who I want to spend the con with.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): when i host rooms i usually ask everyone who has preferences and work around that.
Bill: Sorry if you thought this was some kind of attack.
Aldus Larian (Jess): youve... kinda called us out by name a few times in the past so i kinda thought it was directed at us
Bill: Nope. It’s in general. You just happen to be the number one couple in my life so you’re around the most. ❤️
Bill: Also if I was digging you with this I would be DISGUSTINGLY toxic. Directed passive aggressive to close friends? Ew.
Aldus Larian (Jess): when we were getting ready for katsu you literally said "jess and tom need a turn on the floor"
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~that was a kink it was for boudoir~~
Bill: You were the couple in the room as I was discussing it. But like I said, I’m sorry. Not an attack on you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok
Bill: Is it?
Bill: ~~this is literally the only bitmoji for that?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao not like that i dont.

Aldus Larian (Jess): trivia?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah the history panel because last year they had a whole room full of trivia all day
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah I forgot about this. got distracted by homestuck. WHOOP
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): apparently i am, in fact, driving with kurtis to zenkai
Bill: You can probably still take Georgia tho?
Bill: so she don't have to go alone.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): definitely! just let me know!
Bill: I'm spitballing beedoir like, 9 to 10.
Bill: Thursday.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll have to leave before 10 to get to the meeting on time, gotta check when the all staff meeting is also but i dont see it in my email anywhere. that's usually late though.
Bill: Yeee... could do friday, when the formals happening...
Bill: Not sure whose going besides Georgia tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): might be working during formal tho that's why i'm not formalling <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: faiiiir...
Bill: *oh* yeah thursday before your meeting is a crap shoot, it's a 3 hour trip to Landcaster not 2.
Bill: how late the meeting run?
N🆗ri (Marisa): They’re no longer than like 30 minutes they’re usually just pep talks and “these are the people who u go to for Big Trouble now go have fun and don’t touch anyone”
Bill: oh so we could do late late thursday.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀  mayyyyyyybe
Bill: When you done friday tho?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you might over estimate my energy
Bill: ~~I'm over estimating my own energy~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I dunno who I’m rooming with yet though. I could do late Thursday but I worry I’ll be working with a light sleeper who’s a guest handler who has to be up at like 5am

Friday I officially get done at 9 but BoJo says we finish whenever the dealers hall closes
Bill: Formal's 8 I'm guessing, Rave probably runs till 2...
Bill: When's dealers officially close?
N🆗ri (Marisa): they haven't told us yet uuuuuuuughhh i'll message lanie
or i'll see if i can find last years schedule
Bill: wow fuck staffing.
Bill: Leanna were you planning formal?
N🆗ri (Marisa): o until 8pm last year
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its up in the air, not sure yet. depends whos going
Bill: Could do friday night instead, a little earlier, con hype to ride.
Bill: If we wait till after formal it'll probably be the same time frame as thursday.
N🆗ri (Marisa): could also do a morning
Bill: Could?
Bill: Could.
Bill: Still would be light in windows but like, w/e at this point. It'd have to be like, before 11 saturday or 1 friday?

N🆗ri (Marisa): 10 on saturday
Bill: It'd have to be friday then. Fuck trying to do a shoot, in the room, as we're checking out.
Bill: Silver elite marriott isn't getting us THAT much of an extended check out.
Bill: if at all.
Bill: I guess it's like... try for thursday and if we're beat do friday morning. May need to push back the teen titans a little bit but I doubt that's much of a problem.
Bill: It's not you, it's us getting there so damn late.
Bill: why are all the good cons far away. TT
N🆗ri (Marisa): taiyaki party when
Bill: when would you two be good by on friday morning, in that case?

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): did kurtis wanna drive or me drive or what do what
N🆗ri (Marisa): not much to sew and glue on to ourselves
Bill: lets. aim for 9. So we can fail and do it at 10.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): uhhh we can get kurtis in on this conversation when he gets out of work
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> were you considering the Renora at all? ~~<@!386874959009415170> something about virgin killer?~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kk cause its 3 hours and 15 mins to go my house>your house>con
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i have one of those somewhere should i bring it

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and 2 hours 21 mins to go straight to con

Bill: how the fuck is no one on your way. you go straight west.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Y i k e s
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but for more reasons than 3rd wheeling
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~what do you mean third wheeling is fantastic~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): red dot is leanna
Bill: how is she just about as out of the way as *us*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): georgias in a weird spot
Bill: understatement of the year.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if i left from rutgers its 2 hours 50 mins to your house and then con
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but im on spring break then haaaaaa.....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): As weird as it sounds, I think I am the closest to being "on her way" xD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): REALLY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): where _are_ you erik
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wyomissing
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): near reading, *right*?
N🆗ri (Marisa): those sound fake
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye Wyomissing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so hypothetically it would only add 10 minutes to your drive... but I plan on driving myself anyway
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): damn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i _am_ in a weird location lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what do y'all do for parking because I am much confused. Lancaster Parking Authority shows "maximum of 24 hours" so like, I'm a little confused
Bill: I’m parking with the hotel.
Bill: May even valet cause fuck it I’’ bouche
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): how much is parking with the hotel?
N🆗ri (Marisa): $8 a day, speak to the front desk and ask for the convention parking rate
N🆗ri (Marisa): for both the hotel and nearby parking garages
N🆗ri (Marisa): u need the voucher though
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh yeah fuck it then, ill park with the hotel too lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😮
Aldus Larian (Jess): where da voucher?
N🆗ri (Marisa): speak to the front desk. soooometimes the zenkaikon info desk has it, but those are more for staff and they only have a limited amount, but the front desk has the majority of 'em
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa
N🆗ri (Marisa): reduced parking rate isn't just for staff it's for all attendees there should be info on the site somewhere
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee this page
https://zenkaikon.com/location/directions
Bill: Who wants to see something AMAZING..
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok so parking can get added to room?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): $8 a day is a fucking steal
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru you can't just say that and then leave
Bill: *this fucking cosplayer*
Bill: IS AMAZING.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh ew delete that where's the amazing thing u were talking about
N🆗ri (Marisa): nice picture bad cosplayer
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nice picture nice cosplayer
N🆗ri (Marisa): i photoshop them out and put jess in then u can hang it in a museum
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO
Bill: The picture doesn’t even do it JUSTICE THO.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: You right it is cute..
N🆗ri (Marisa): cute picture awful cosplayer
N🆗ri (Marisa): nice bow imma make more of those bows
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah, totally not screen accurate enough. The wig is two shades too light or too dark
N🆗ri (Marisa): that was taken at night look how bright and flashy biru's camera is isn't it cool
Bill: Oh btw server rule, at any given opportunity you have to fluff Marisa’s ego.
Aldus Larian (Jess): My arm died for that picture
Bill: Particularly good when she doesn’t expect it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no that's not a rule that's a lie
N🆗ri (Marisa): JESS NO IM SORRY
N🆗ri (Marisa): IT DID
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do not
Aldus Larian (Jess): Apologize
N🆗ri (Marisa): we sacrificed so much
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): the holy trinity
N🆗ri (Marisa): oof i gotta make that skirt fuller
N🆗ri (Marisa): 💪
Bill: Are you going to redo Katarina?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't distract from your beauty with me
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah probably
N🆗ri (Marisa): dunno when though, maybe when the anime gets closer
Bill: Glad to hear it.
Bill: Improve or complete redo?
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmmmmmm. might be hard to improve it without entirely redoing it <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Maybe reuse so,e of the bows and stuff?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't think i'll be entering any more contests though im so offended by katsu's judges
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't think you have redo her!
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah she suck
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO
Bill: SHE GOOD
N🆗ri (Marisa): lookit that
eughh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): What happen at katsu
Bill: But, I understand if you’re the type that would rather start fresh than improve on what’s there. I do that with code, I’d rather scratch everything that reuse.
Bill: I’m glad you aren’t discouraged and are going to make it happen!
Bill: ~~Not needing to rush between moving and Katsu will probably help~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i felt like trash from the judges. they didn't look at my reference material, didn't ask any questions and i feel like they barely looked at me. I said when I first got there that I made every piece of the costume and they acted surprised when I started explaining how i made something. like "you made your hoop skirt?" ya. and then i start talking about the shoes and how i made them and they go "oh you made your boot covers?" and i was like *i didn't say covers i said i made the shoes*
they didn't smile at all, i tried cracking some jokes and they were deadpan whereas with the person before me they were chatty and laughing and i felt like something was hugely wrong with me. i hated it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw it'd just be hard to improve on what's already there because it would fall apart because of how tightly i sewed it together :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): the fabric would start unravelling from the ends and there's not enough to cut off extra and re-sew it
N🆗ri (Marisa): and the judges usually aren't like that. i've entered waaay worse costumes into even bigger contests before and they're usually quite nice.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They sound like big fat meanies and their opinions are invalid
N🆗ri (Marisa): when i entered a couple of them said hi and I had to go "is it okay if I start?" because there was no indication if i could begin or not
N🆗ri (Marisa): just silence ;u;
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's so uncomfortable what the fuck
N🆗ri (Marisa): and them looking down at their sheets, like if they were looking up I could take as a sign it's ok to start but they seemed preoccupied
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): so. i'm kind of out for contests for a while. they made me feel absolutely horrible and really turned me off from contests. which is a shame because i did have fun waiting with other competitors and their friends, they were really nice and we took selfies
N🆗ri (Marisa): leanna were you able to enter at all during the weekend?
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): yasss alien queen
Bill: So I low key looked at Jess8s face and went “oh wow, the paint covered her mole”.

The mole. That’s part of 2b. Another cosplay.
Bill: MAYBE we do a lot Nier shoots.
Bill: Jess, to Katsucon judges.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I didnt enter, literally right before I was gonna head up to the line my lights stopped working on half of leggings and I was just not comfortable showing off something that had just broken.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Jess is adorable
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg that sucks do you know why? 😱
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's how I packed it. I bent the EL wire too much
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So now I have to replace that whole part
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I learned my lesson though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Do not fold el wire
Bill: Good news, Mina and Corn Done. Bad news, Studio style lighting reacts differently to lightroom sliders and I want to do Katarina on my laptop rather than tablet.
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank u it is time to Dance
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dat me!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also fun fact I don't wear the mole for 2B most of the time cuz Tom doesn't like it
N🆗ri (Marisa): dont let whatshisface angry instagrammer know
top secret
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What’s tom got against moles
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They ruin your yard
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's not against moles
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think it's just that mole idk, ask him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That mole in particular smh
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm probably just bad at making it look natural
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When I hear the word mole I always think of that scene in Austin Powers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): SAME
Aldus Larian (Jess): My washer destroyed the ribbon on my pink dress 😭
Bill: Oooof
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa it's ok I'll get over it, kinda messed up the lace in my black dress too wtf
