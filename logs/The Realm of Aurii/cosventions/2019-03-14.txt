Bill: <@!334090409389195266> Andrew needs to do an all might wig for Next.
Bill: He Lurk ™ but my best friend from college and good boi.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'll do small might
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Well... idk I wanna do Ms. Joke
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like real bad
Bill: hold on.
Bill: I'm not asking you to do be all might. XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Who wants to do all might
Bill: Andrew lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ohhhhh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I help
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): RIP I just saw his tag
Bill: whose tag?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Sorry I'm like concrunching and half paying attention
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I just saw you tagged andrew
Bill: Oh ye lol
Bill: There you go Andoru, you have introduction to wig queen.
Andrew: Hello, I am the Andrew of which he speaks.
Andrew: And yes Im planning on doing All Might for Next, and I have next to no skill at stytling wigs
Andrew: But I want to try lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): for zenkaikon i could transfer to team P, which handles security from 5pm to 2am each day. but they get stuck dealing with drunk people and I don't even know how to tell if someone is drunk.
Bill: Don’t transfer to that that sucks.
N🆗ri (Marisa): more free daytime and i hear ilene is a good team leader.
but i worked in the dealers hall for like 5 years so i'm more familiar with it and the people who run it
N🆗ri (Marisa): over half the people on team P quit
Bill: The hours suck for someone who wants to drink/do events.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they finally sent out staff schedule sign-ups and it's not even complete <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can drink on duty they have those water coolers scattered around
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can use my one hour dinner break on the rwby meetup if there isn't an autograph line at that time
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> you'll be up all night
N🆗ri (Marisa): just until 2am. that's like usual con bedtime.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but i'm probably going to stick with exhibits hall team
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo I was reading it wrong
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea if say stick to what u are familiar with
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dealing with drunk people is not fun
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye 😭
also i think lanie still likes me, she's the head of the dealer's hall now that kristen retired as head and everyone else from our old team has had a major falling out with lanie so i can be the go-between
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, BoJo prefers to deal with her minimally but they're still cordial and Rose doesn't even want to hear lanie's name ever
Bill: ~~quit staff next year and play with us all con~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~very tempting seeing how horribly staff is being run this year~~ but money
and i've staffed at zenkai so long people would probably ask me to help do stuff anyway <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i kept getting roped in to line duty when i was done working in 2016
N🆗ri (Marisa): "hey are u busy" "no i'm done working" "great hold this sign"
Bill: You won’t get roped into stuff cause you’ll be with us.
Bill: Zenkai is the cheapest con on the circuit. If there’s a con you should buy into over staffing, it’s Zenkai.
N🆗ri (Marisa): y'all just have expensive hotel rooms <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aww Justin messaged me to say sorry he couldn't join MM group on Sunday since he's only going Sunday. What a good bean
N🆗ri (Marisa): homestuck cosplay appreciation time
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa):

Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo where?
Bill: unique photo.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Das city(
Bill: Nope. Unique photo is fairfield.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo neat
Bill: half hour fourty minutes east on 80.
Bill: hmm. It's a gamble, and 100 bucks for a gamble but. Could be useful.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i know where dat is
Bill: I did one lighting class, but it was kinda. short and more of a lecture.
Bill: I'd basically go right from that to watch movies.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O I know that summoner and davesprite lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know the davesprite too! :0 
The karkat in the last image and the spidermom are both Ceri. I used to be friends with that derse roxy but it’s been years since she updated any of her social media so I worry
Bill: Decide after lunch.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Then again Kaisia disappeared off the face of the internet for like 3 years and logged on one day like “lol I forgot about Facebook and twitter and all forms of communication”
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s a girl like that from high school. She was a social media queen. Went totally silent after graduation. We think her parents put her in a cult. An Instagram that looks like her popped up but it’s private and she won’t respond to anyone’s requests or messages.
N🆗ri (Marisa): What’s for lunch
Bill: Leanna and Georgia are both formalling right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YUUUUP
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): fancy schmancy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho i had a dream last night i was late for the formal

Bill: ~~I plan on drinking during boudoir so buzz'll be started~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i will also need to do that

Bill: Also could do chilis earlier right, with me and Georgia not shooting at 7:30.

N🆗ri (Marisa): u a cat
boogie woogie oogie
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't even know what people wear to raves?
Bill: I'm not *thotty* but I just wear jeans and t shirt cause.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll probably keep the leggings on because if there's any black lights, those stripes will be bright af
Aldus Larian (Jess): i usually just wear some striped down version of a cosplay
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): here we go: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01F2N3D9Y/ref=twister_B01F2N3CZ4
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ive never been to a rave, but i assume its just thotty versions of characters
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): or just comfy clothes
N🆗ri (Marisa): lots of lights, those furry leg warmers, plenty of fishnets
N🆗ri (Marisa): those hats with the tube hair
Bill: Anything mobile, and cool so you don't over heat.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): SHIT HOW QUICKLY CAN I GET LIGHT UP SHOES
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is typical rave attire
N🆗ri (Marisa): for con ravers
N🆗ri (Marisa): *hurry erik*
N🆗ri (Marisa): pictures from raves look so funny
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): me:
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok I can get light up shoes by Saturday
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~might get light up cat ears~~
Bill: 1. Rick Gerrity is Tom's shunned cousin, probably

2. oof me? a model? My likeness breaks cameras.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The other day at work they were talking about someone named  Michael Garry and I was so confused
Aldus Larian (Jess): how do people do that thing where they share other people's posts (not stories) to their stories?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the little arrow next to the post
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): paper airplane looking dude
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooo cool thank
Bill: ~~is the smoke that cool?~~
Bill: Like, it seems like it to everyone and I guess as someone who doesn't get the pictures done of him, it's less exciting.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a neat concept but seems dangerous and bad for the environment imo
N🆗ri (Marisa): like how everyone jumped on that flour photoshoot bandwagon but it turned out to be super flammable
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's cool, but.... you need to use it correctly
Aldus Larian (Jess): it looks neat, adds a certain mood, like magicy
Bill: hmm. Cool cool.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like i think some of the photos hunter posted just didnt look that great
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but then like the one with the blue smoke
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that looked really striking
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and the one with the white smoke that was basically just fog looked cool and could be used well for like creepy aesthetic
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): couldve used it for predator tbh
Bill: yeee.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee. the pirate one with white smoke was cool but a bit out of place in a forest
Bill: Just not my style I guess.
Bill: I also hate backdrops of barren trees. It's... weird to me. Too much sky in the trees.
Bill: That's a generally thing. Cosplay or not.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i liked the girl in tha balck dress but it prob just called to my inner goth kid
Bill: The smoke, bar the fog one really, doesn't get rid of dislike for the setting.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’d prefer to see smoke in a controlled studio setting but that’s probably dangerous because no escape for the smoke
Bill: ye you don't want to breath too much of it.
Bill: I think it'd be better in the woods, outside.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the ones with casey up close look better because it takes away that weird barren tree background
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but from looking at other photos, it lends itself better for photos in the forrest when its not...winter
Bill: Ye. Personally I don't find the fog striking enough, it just seems... there. Like, I'd want to do that with dynamic shadows or something that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the pirate one would have looked cooler if the smoke was positioned closer to the gun barrel so it looked like it was post firing
Bill: Get some high contrast.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if the smoke was in front of her
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): also maybe different lighting
Bill: mm. I doubt they have much control over the smoke tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like closer to golden hour
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its pretty controlled
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): me and hunter played with them before we went to nyc that one day
Bill: Not tryin to nitpick Hunter's work, it's more like. I just don't see the smoke as that exciting.
Bill: So I asked.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean. it's not THAT exciting
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but, it could be, if used right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it can just add a neat aesthetic to certain photos
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah , if used appropriately
Bill: which is just a general thing for any SFX.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i guess more so, sometimes photo locations just suck, and if you were to introduce the smoke to the setting it would make it less boring to look at
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont think it works for everything though
Bill: THAT true.
Bill: oof.
Bill: I just saw Casey post the smoke photos on facebook.
Bill: and I thought.
Bill: *Me*
Bill: *I thought*
Bill: *More saturation*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Signs you’re improving
Bill: *Help Marisa is in my head*
Bill: *she's plugging in a microwave AND a sewing machine I could die*
Dizzy: You should choose  no class <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: !choose light class, no class <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: ~~that didn't help I'm still conflicted.~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so that means you want to go
Aldus Larian (Jess): ☝
Bill: The coin flip trick usually works but the conflicting feeling isn't strong enough.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Go to classss
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Knowledge is power
Bill: Just don't want to pay 100 bucks and not learn anything. I know more than I give myself credit for a times.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is 100 something where you can just cut the loss?
Bill: Are you asking I can afford to waste 100 bucks? 😏
Bill: I can, I just need to start being more conservative on purchases at some point. I bought 450 bucks of cosplay stuff on a whim like, not a great habit. Eheh.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I thought I was bad
Bill: *I’ve never lied to you, always said I’m just as bad if not worse*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 450 for what owo
Bill: Hazel and Barry. Back in February.
Bill: Still don’t have them so ripperoni.
Bill: Got a 3d printed magnum revolver for Barry too cause you can’t be Barry without his gun.
Bill: Kinda regret Barry. I can do the look, but I haven’t played the right game (only read the books/did the spin off versions), that game isn’t the popular one that’s out rn (and I ain’t boyband enough for Leon), and no one I know does RE (Gen doesn’t count she pretty flaky).
Bill: I’ll never do it cause it require serious effort, but Mr X where it at.
Bill: Anyway.
Bill: Think I’ll do it.
Bill: ... do I want Mirio.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do Mirio and I'll do Sir Nighteye
Bill: 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||oooooooooooffff big oof||
do it
Bill: When tho...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good question
N🆗ri (Marisa): now
Aldus Larian (Jess): Right now
Bill: I was just considering it for Friday... most of BNE is BNHA.
Bill: ~~I just remembered I don’t care about BNE, I care about Aurii~~
