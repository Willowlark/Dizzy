Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That makes alot more sense then Jenn 😂
Bill: True now that I think about it.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Illumination hype \(owo)/
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): why discord not let me do a backslash. ruins my emoji. unforgivable.
Bill: Oh WOW.
Bill: Love that.
Bill: I usually don’t like the Japanese photogs but that was good.
Bill: ~~fuck I’m jealous~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): to be fair he had a ton of equipment and light stands that usually aren't allowed at US events
he said he specialized in strobe images like that and he had a ton of really cool pictures like this on his ipad
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): also like 5 different lenses. he'd take a picture and then be like "hold on i'm switching lenses," and then another shot later be like "wait a minute i'm getting another lens now"
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i think the record for equipment by a photog i shot with today was one of those light umbrellas that stood on its own, a self-standing external flash, and two reflectors, one of which had to be held by another dude, and all that definitely would never pass at any US con
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): are u redu 4 sum BASEBAWL
Bill: I gotta open Katsu shoots publicly, but effort.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): go all out. hold a party to announce it.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Since the makeup area and the dressing room were separate I was able to get pictures of what Japanese cosplay events look like. 
People in a big room like this where they change and put on their wig/makeup in their little spot, no mirrors. This is the makeup area but the changing room looks exactly the same. The empty spots here are where people finished and left, and staff will immediately seat new people there when they can.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): DAMN that night lit one is so good
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That was today?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah!! i'm really excited. we spent about 15 minutes on a shoot and he sent me 2 pictures, i dunno if that's all i'll get or if he'll send more but i'm very happy with it. ye it was today (yesterday technically since it's 1am)
it was right around 4pm-ish, I did another two shoots when it got darker and 1 more shoot right after that, since a line for me formed while that picture was being taken
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): let me find his page
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): actually.... was that the first guy or the second guy? 🤔 that pic might've been from the second guy and not the first lemme double check
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): So many guis
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): no ye that's the first guy ok

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Do they just find you?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Or give you a card
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): one guy was like "hey aren't you from comiket and acosta. we keep running into each other" lol
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): "Hey aren't you the one white girl"
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): basically cosplayers just sit around and photographers will come up and ask to do photoshoots. sometimes they give cards (this guy gave me his card), other times they just take down the cosplayer's information. We have either business cards or signs, I use the signs so after the photoshoot they'll take a picture of my sketchbook that has all my info (twitter and archive are the big ones) and send me the pictures on twitter
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): YEAH PRETTY MUCH
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): "hey you're the foreigner with glasses"
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): turns out my makeup wasn't the wrong color like I thought all summer, my face just got more tanned than the rest of my skin so it's slowly been reverting back to normal after comiket <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): AHA i finally found an example in my photos that isn't my sign
cosplayers will prop these up somewhere near themselves so photogs can take a picture and contact them after the event
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the cosplayers will usually stick to one spot and photographers will line up
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): a lot of event photography in japan usually sucks because there are specific areas where cosplay is allowed, and it's banned elsewhere so you're basically taking pictures in a super confined space with 10,000 people in the background
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): here's comiket's cosplay area. you can see the cosplayers in front of the orange cones that designate the cosplay space, and the photogs lined up to get pictures of them
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): ooo I see, and yeah you mentioned that :/ it kinda succ
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I guess it's the by product of something that is so popular that it's become mainstream?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Will America's conventions end up like that someday?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~i only have a set number of conversation topics oops~~
maybe? I don't think so because the photography culture is so different. i've never had a full impromptu shoot for free at a con, although it does happen rarely. otaku culture is very different in japan vs the US because of cultural/social differences so US events probably won't wind up like this
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Truuue
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Free shoots is nice but I'm sure it's only for women anyways
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I want to say “no!!!” but tbh youre probably right
Or really really good cross dressers
Or guys who pull off the character perfectly 
There are some women photographers
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Otherwise most guys need a group or a girl with them to get more than a few passing phone shots
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeahhhhh
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It be like that sometimes
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I know that whodigiya on insta got some photographers interested in him at tgs but also he’s shredded and super tall so he’s the perfect fighting game cosplayer
