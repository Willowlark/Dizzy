No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): how many people wore fedoras
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): trilbys
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ok so first was we were all sitting around (all BNE people) playing CAH cuz there was nothing better to do and this guy came up and asked to play and like ok fine whatever but then he acted offended and complained about every card and like??? That game is supposed to be like that so idk what he thought he was getting into

Next some like 65+ yr old dude asked for pics but w/e not a huge deal I didn't give him my info though cuz im not about that life

Next was some super socially awkward dude ask for pics if us to post in his noragami blog and I didn't give him my info either cuz yea major creep vives whatever

Then at night some Snaji cosplay ran up to me while u was wearing Nora and asked if I was Nami? And I was like "no I'm Nora from RWBY" and get was basically telling me how excited he was that he thought I was his waifu or someshit and then he was like "well maybe I'll have to watch rwby now üòâ" and I was like "uhhhh" but then Georgia cane and asked to take a selfie with me so she saved me but...

Then 5 seconds later a Hazel cosplayer started talking to her about Pyrrha and he was like "oh are you supposed nto be uhhhh?" And I'm like "Nora, yea" ~~like holy fuck dude our characters had a fight scene together~~ and THEN he started talking about his skin condition???!?! So I was like "Georgia I have to go to the bathroom you wanna come with" 

And finally we went outside and some dude was like "Pyrrha, can I sing you a song?" So I pretended I got a call on my phone and I was like "yea sorry we GTG like RIGHT NOW"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): JESS DELIVERS
WOOOOO
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): awwwwww yeah
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like we just kept saving each other from creeps all night
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): omg random dude getting offended at CAH? how oldish was he?

a blog *just* for noragami. noragami blog.

oh man oh no oh sanji oh hazel
oh boy
american cons are something
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): careful with bathrooms because i've used those to hide before and people will just camp outside
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's ok Tom's always on backup and biru and other too usually
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~like can you people knock it the fuck off before I back hand you with MY FUCKING WEDDING RING~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like there were just multiple dude lurking around and running up and talking to like any girl plz help
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oh nooooo
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i bet they all went to that flirting panel
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): If they did they totally didn't listen cuz the first thing the guy said was to "read body language" and these dudes def did not know how to do that üòÇ
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): backing up and leaning away? she's def into you üëå
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~ring on her left ring finger, def not into you~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea like the panel had some decent advice for the kinds of people who don't have ANY idea what they are doing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also most of these people stunk
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "wow sweet a girl, and she comes with a ring already so i don't have to buy one!"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "I wonder who that conventionally attractive male standing right behind her is?"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): stick with me, people either rarely try to hit on me or I'm too socially oblivious to realize what's happening so we can easily escape
"wow you guys are cosplaying a couple, that's crazy. if only you were a real couple that'd be funny haha"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "that guy doesn't stink so obviously he has no pheromones and poses no threat"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LMFAO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My you and Georgia can be like creep saving trio we can look out for each other üëå
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): we can use bird whistles
I do what I want(tm): *Dabs furiously in the background*
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): and dabbing as signs yeah good idea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like this con had maybe 100 people at it and it's the highest concentration if creeps u ever dealt with
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like usually I have 1-2 uncomfortable experiences at a 3 day con I was at this for 1
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oh noooooo
why do people gotta be like this
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IDK üò≠
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We called Rebecca to make sure she got back to her car ok and only left Leanna in her own cuz her boyfriend was with her
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i wonder if because the price is cheaper than most cons that it attracted more? like why was the creep ratio so high. was there a noticably higher number of male attendees vs female ones?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Not really, I'd say it was even
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The day tine had more like teens with their parents and stuff like by night it was the stragglers
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ooooooo so many creeps wanting to party but there was no party
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): There was a DJ with like 1 person dancing
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): I hope they were dancing really intensely
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They were üòÇ
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): NICE
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i always try to dance but I can't, and it's hard to dance at events here because everyone knows the moves and I can't figure out what the moves are it's just a thing you gotta experience over and over until you learn ; u ;
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): There was another dude walking around and dancing and I lkrhoyght he was gonna be the next creeper
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh I don't know either I just thrash around in my safety circle of friends
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): from what I saw on social media there were a lot of cosplay guests selling prints? do they sell well?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): I didn't think cosplay prints would be very profitable unless you were like, Yaya Han, but it looks like there were a lot of tables?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): There were alot of copsplay guests yea, Leanna was one, she had prints for sale but I don't think she sold any or expected too.most if the guests just seemed like your average cosplayers to me
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oof yikes that's sad about the prints
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They had 2 big backdrops to take pics with biut my cosplays didn't fit the scences
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i've seen that more and more. i know a girl who was invited as a cosplay guest and it was a big deal but she doesn't sew, she had been cosplaying for less than a year, and her few costumes are all school uniforms. she's cool don't get me wrong ~~though i'm still waiting on pictures from a photoshoot with her from 3 years ago that i'll probably never get~~ but not quite cosplay guest material if that makes sense ~~it sounds horrible im sorry oh no~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): green screen???
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): green screen??????
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nah that totally makes sense like I under those standards I could ahve been a guest and I'm definitely not guest material. And nah not green screen just like BIG banner backdrop
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): you've sewed stuff and made cool costumes so you'd be overqualified for those standards
tfw no greenscreen. geekdom what are you DOING
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It was a wreck man
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): we'll make our own con with greenscreens and no creeps
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): And cool guests like kaseicosplay, and wezrez!
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): wow, instagram famous wezrez? i sure would be honored to be in the same vicinity as them as I constantly adjust my wig and slowly starve to death in a corner
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): maybe the rumored superstar whoozica will also make an appearance with the wisest rice
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg üòÇ
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We can play your anime playlist at our super sweet glowstick rave
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH
the one that's all Dragostea din tea on repeat or the other one
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i still have like 50 glowsticks from when i cosplayed neon assuming glowsticks don't expire
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
I do what I want(tm): at our super sweet
I do what I want(tm): *COSPLAYROLLERSKATING*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH
do y'all want to have that again because I can see if jim will let us use his rink again and we can make it BETTER
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): or we could just do cosplay picnics instead they're cheaper and more centrally located
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Tom talks about cosplay roller skating all da time
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i would've joined a japanese roller derby team if I didn't have school during the meetings <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It was really fun! Even tho I am bad at skate. We could probably get even more people too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ohhh nooo RIP roller derby dreams
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH if i make it public this time
I made it private because I thought it could be turned public later and because people were worried about creeps
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i'm out of touch with what's popular in the US right now though y'all gotta teach me
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i wanna run anime trivia again but all my questions are like 5 years out of date hmm
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): omg would anime wheel of fortune be cool
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Bnha is huge. üòÇ Honestly besides that I don't even know
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): how about Cells at Work? or was that short lived
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): jojo probably still at it with jojos
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea those are pretty popular I think!
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): if i do do trivia i'll probably post a feeler survey to see what people are into, because what's popular online and what people actually know irl are super different <:rip:369476083248267274>
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): *time to start making questions*
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): *and avoid homework*
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Family feud would be cool if I can implement it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Voltron would prob be good
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): OH YEAH
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): VOLTRON
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Non anime category for Voltron, dragon prince, miraculous, Steven universe, Star, rwby, gravity falls, otgw, all the stuff that tumblr loves
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh yea that good
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Maybe video games? üòÆ
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oooo yeah!
So I could do jeopardy then, categories like these would be best for that
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): the buzzers would just be the hard part
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): they have bells and stuff online I'd just have to listen super carefully
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): RECORDABLE BUZZERS
i can make one "b-baka!!"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We have game-show type buzzers at work, maybe I could ask where they get them from?
I do what I want(tm): Peeps are into bnha castle vania and that's pm it atm
I do what I want(tm): I think cells at work is on a decline
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): people need to get crazier about stuff smh
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): that would be awesome if you can ask. most are pretty expensive like $60+ but if they have a source for nice inexpensive ones... üëÄ
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): the cells can't decline at work we'd all die
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Everything goes in and out so fast it's so hard to plan anything üò≠
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ignore fads, be your own fad üåü
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üåû
I do what I want(tm): I read that to be our guest
I do what I want(tm): But also to prince Ali
I do what I want(tm): Not sure why
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): live action hype is why
I do what I want(tm): MAKE WAYYYYYYYY
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): I know I've made anime jeopardy before but I can't remember.
I'd need at least 2 rounds. categories might be something like:
magical girls (maybe magical companions?) / rpgs / movies / isekai / old school
harems / manga without adaptations (maybe this is too niche) / uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): irl stuff like conventions or events
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wats isekai?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I am dum
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): other world! stuff where the protagonist gets teleported or reincarnated
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): it's all the rage right now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooooo yea! I think biru told me that once
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): like konosuba, tensei slime, no game no life and stuffs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Jepordy would probably be good cuz people could pick what they know
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ye!! ~~i'm alreadying drafting questions and downloading a ppt template oops~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOPs
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): it's usually the top questions are easier and the bottom ones are harder right?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cosplay catagory maybe? I think harder is bottom
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): hmm, what sort of stuff would go into a cosplay category? ü§î
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like maybe "this material is used to create weapons and armor, is lightweight and affordable" "craft foam" ~~nitbsurebit could be a terrible idea~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): omg people would fight so much
"ASBESTOS"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "many cosplayers chose to create a _____ before making their final build" "mock-up"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that's tru tho since everyone's methods are different it may create some diacourse
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "a..... an effigy?"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ~~Man who's got materials to make a mock-up? spssh~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i dunno if i should use pictures or stick to descriptions for character-based questions
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Right?! Not me
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): cosplay jeopardy would be pretty neat tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oo pics might be good for some
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "waifus and husbandos" catagory
Who dis?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): [just a blank pillow]
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lmao yas
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ya pictures might be good for the harder ones but then it might be too obvious. hmmMMm. i need to become clever and snappy to make better descriptions.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You can do it!
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): this is Bad
I just discovered cosplay books after getting curious and looking it up on Amazon
we don't really have them in the US aside from independent stuff but there's a ton of incredibly awesome books here about fabric types and patterning and whatnot
I don't have money for them all ;u;
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): like this one lists what fabrics are best for fantasy and asian styled clothing
Bill: Catching up: slong as I‚Äôm hovering nearby I think I‚Äôm a decent creep deterrent. I‚Äôm a big guy, don‚Äôt smile, and make eye contact long before they get close enough to talk cause I‚Äôm paranoid as fuck.
Bill: Only thing that confuses me is where the line is, particularly with Georgia, because she puts up with some stupid shit from con goers because they‚Äôre fans.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i have images of you smiling which refute your non-smiling theory
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): creepiness is weird I'm trying to describe it but I can't. hmm.
Bill: Back up theory, they‚Äôre like ‚Äúhe looks like one of us, he must have these pretty people covered. Come bruhdas, we must spread out harassment to another group of people so no one may enjoy the con‚Äù
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oh noo
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): tbh though that's probably exactly their reasoning. not the "one of us" part but the "oh they've got a white knight" thing
Bill: That‚Äôs more Tom.
Bill: Ring on the finger.
Bill: I‚Äôve been mulling over what the escape phrase should be. I wanna see the creepazoid who‚Äôll argue with me.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ESCAPE PHRASE YEAH
Bill: I think I last settled on ‚Äúcan you spot check my makeup‚Äù because it sounds normal but you‚Äôd never actually want me to do that cause I know nothing about makeup.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): to exit a situation?
I guess saying something like "Maximus is waiting for us let's go" is too obvious ü§î
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): or they might follow
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): plus multiple phrases might be needed in case you run into the same person again aaaaa
Bill: Oh, I‚Äôll just say we have to leave and if anyone follows I‚Äôll tell them it‚Äôs a private shoot, we‚Äôll need you to stop.
Bill: If you needed to escape once, I‚Äôm going to assume avoiding further contact is the goal. Easy.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ye that's what i was just thinking. be like "we're on a really tight schedule and are leaving now" and make it up if they press for more. the shoot is a good idea
Bill: Not to mention I don‚Äôt care about being mean to people so.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): h a r d c o r e
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): we can't be mean because that means the creep might escalate things so pls be mean for us
especially if they go "where's my goodbye hug" because i imagine georgia might get that a lot
Bill: Mhmm.
I do what I want(tm): Ooof
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): aww fudge.
this cosplay making book has a CD full of patterns and is designed to be printed out at home
but japanese paper is a different size than US paper
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i wonder if the computers at school have a CD drive and I can just print them en masse there
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): someone in class brought in 8.5x11 paper last week and it really messed everybody up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What size is Japanese standard paper anyway?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): A4! sometimes people use... b4? i think? for some stuff but A4 is the common
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): all my notebooks are b4 size
I do what I want(tm): 210. 247
I do what I want(tm): Mm
I do what I want(tm): Is a4
I do what I want(tm): I wonder what b4 is
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): lemme see if I can find that dude's handout for a comparison
I do what I want(tm): 250 ,353 it looks like
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's like just slightly different from 8.5 x 11? Just enough to mess you up
I do what I want(tm): Lots printers can adjust to paper size tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
I do what I want(tm): As long as you select do not scale your patterns should print the right size
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH thank u jess I was about to give up lol
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): in person a4 looks a lot longer and thinner while letter is short and stout
from what I saw it looks like the pattern's a PDF where each page is specially designed to fit your home printer for *maximum convenience*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea you should be able to use the patterns still! You might have to compensate a little for the gaps in worst case scenario but that's it
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i'll send the one book here juuuuust in case and then have the rest immediately sent home. these books look absolutely amazing though i love them
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): we've been considering an artist alley table for a while so maybe we could make some of these to sell
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): though lizzy sells skirts and they're not super popular con items
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üòÆ
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): japanese cosplay stuff is on a whole nother level. they have magazines each month just for cosplay makeup. like. woah.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg that's amazing
I do what I want(tm): Yeah I understand you'll prob lose some of the image but as long as you select do not scale it should all be the right size at least
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): there's a store in shinjuku for cosplayers that's so big it takes up 3 buildings with 6 floors each. one floor for wigs, one for makeup, various floors for lace and cloth and stuffs
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): loss.jpeg
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): truu
I do what I want(tm): Or it'll print tiny little strips of the clipped image on new pages ooc
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): trace it on tracing paper over the computer
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): this one book has a tutorial for how to make a lightweight vending machine to carry around
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): just in case.
Bill: Any better escape phrases than 'spot check my makeup'?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): gotta go rustle my jimmies
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ü§î  the thing with creep situations is they are really situational?
Bill: I figure in cosplay spot checking makeup is a fairly normal thing to do.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but then you need to some up with something after that to get the person away from the creeper
Bill: Yeah, I can deal with that.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): what about grossing them out with girl stuff
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "gotta go or i'm gonna bleed all over the con bye"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ruins their manic pixie dreamgirl image
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "GOTTA GO IM LEAKING"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "GOTTA TAKE MY BIRTH CONTROL"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): the bad thing about these though, like the makeup one too, is it ruins the person's image if the person you're trying to get away from starts talking. like "oh you're so obsessed with your makeup huh?"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "GOTTA GO TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST WHOOPS"
Bill: could just be a gesture?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): body language is a good way to tell, ill shuffle alot, look around, avoid looking at the person.
Bill: I had leaned that way before.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): start throwing gang signs as a signal
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if i make eye contact with you and make my eyes really wide thats like : GET ME OUTTTT"
Bill: ~~I'm dumb and don't want to miss the signal~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): it's kind of a "can you believe this guy" look except it really means "pls help"
Bill: I also don't want to speak for anyone, particularly Georgia since she has her 'fan image' to keep up.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): omg do you remember "hey are you guys cosplaying" guy from the MouTele shoot at otakon
he came off as a creep
Bill: so I want to be sure before I start talking for someone.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): if it's a false signal, like you say "lets go" they could always say "ok in a few minutes" or such and then when they've had enough they can be like "yeah ur right we gotta go"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i mean i cant speak for her ofc but for me at least if i do big eyes, save me. I think the fake phone call thing worked pretty good but also we were leaving the con so that helped
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): for the phone call thing did you have your phone play sound or did you just pick it up and talk?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA thats true "we should get going" "ok hold on" or "yea im sorry i really gotta go"
Bill: Like I said before, I can be mean.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): alot of creeps are not very brave when it comes down to it.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "where are you going?" "~~away from you~~"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so most of the times a simple "gotta go" works
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): orly?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i get the opposite lol. i rarely get any creepys but the ones I do are *persistant*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): really?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hmm ü§î
Bill: you con alone too much.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): TRUE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): when you have a whole group to pull you away its a little more effective
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ya i had to leave choukaigi early the first time i went because dude kept following me around and touching me weirdly and waiting outside the bathroom
Bill: for the record you are no more allowed to be alone conning than Georgia or Jess.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> shares most of your key fandoms anyway.
Bill: Fire Emblem, random webcomics.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): andru webcomics? :0
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ~~mystic mess~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA sometimes when I am alone ill pretend to get a phone call or just be on the phone
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if its Mysme i can be with you silly
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH "sorry i gotta go my bf seven is calling"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "your boyfriend's name is seven?"
"yeah he's korean bye"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): perhaps i look too scary so it scares away the nervous ones
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): idk how you con alone so much you are so brave
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): pull out a knife, scare them all away
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): tis the only thing i know~
o ya i usually carry a knife or two
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): heads up for that <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i don't have any here because i couldn't bring them on the plane
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): pepperspray? brass knuckle?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): we have a bunch of pepper spray but the cans make me nervous in extreme temperatures. not so much brass knuckles (they're illegal in NJ) but I have those rings that have the same impact. i just don't wear rings.
usually this
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I HAVE THAT
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): if i spray anything at someone i prefer heavy duty insect repellenat
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): WOOOO
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): KNIFE KEY KNIFE KEY
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): [sprays hornet killer in their eyes] haha oops
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): siwwy me! uwu my badsies!!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): WOOO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): kick them in the balls and scream
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): RETRO KNIFE KEY
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i can't scream i tried once and my sister made fun of me for like.... still i'm pretty sure she still makes fun of me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): gotta do what you gotta do man
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you come home and well all take self deffence classes
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i can crush someone's eye ball!!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): we had self defense classes in high school we had to disarm cops with guns and stuff
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats so cool wtf i want that
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i'm so quiet i just literally don't have the vocal capacity to shout. big lung capacity but no chords.
Bill: Go to school near camden.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): come to my high school we can pretend to be students
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): or that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): maybe they give us a deal if we buy in bulk https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ar-wear-confidence-protection-that-can-be-worn#/
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oh yeah I remember that!!
just intimidate them with one of those wallets that catch on fire
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i keep my knife key in my wallet how hardcore would it be to pull a knife out of a fire
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~god luck trying to figure out the maze of underclothing im wearing, rapists~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): TRUE
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): most costumes i'm wearing like 8-9 layers of pants
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): cosplay burlesque has super specially designed costumes because cosplay is *not* designed to be easy to wear
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and this is why i try not to be alone at cons ever
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ~~it's too hard to move in 9 layers of pants?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no lol cuz of fear of the worst
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): most im wearing is probably 4 layes but its ussually more like 2 üò±
Bill: why do we go to events where we have to discuss how to keep creepy men from stalking and harassing our female friends?
Bill: Is that dumb?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): nah it ain't just anime cons it's literally everywhere üëç
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ‚òù
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): jess i'll give you more pants to wear we can easily get you up to at least 6 or 7 layers
Bill: Geekdom is definitely a special level of freak.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): that will solve everything. more pants.
yikes. i wonder if maybe it was their advertising?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but how were we supposed to kno it would have such a high concentration
Bill: we couldn't.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and we arent going back again
Bill: Nope.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cons bring out the creeps cuz they have a highly concentrated interest in games and anime
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): and they know girls in skimpy outfits will be there
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): like, sports have a lot of creeps but it's not so much a noticable problem because all the girls there are either untouchable (cheerleaders) or with their family/partner and fully dressed
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they are so used to anime and games ~~and hentai~~ that particular breed of shelter of sheltered weebs have stopped seeing women as people and as just another anime girl to fufill fantasies
Bill: I mean, I know all this.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im not saying you dont im just stating it
Bill: I have a debilitating fear of being seen that way because I look like a basement dweller (not that I feel I act that way, but people judge on looks).
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im not going to stop doing stuff i like, or attending event I like cuz i might get raped
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~because in that case id never leave the house~~
Bill: Boy the world is fucked up.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): people judge based more on body language than looks so i think you're fine biru
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): maybe that's why i get left alone i have incredibly creepy body language
Bill: mmmmnahhhh.
Bill: bbiab
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i cant speak for all girls but i dnt see every guy at a con as a creep. it s the approach, the persistance, and the inability to read the persons reactions
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you are not like that you arnt a stuttering fan boy mess, you dont smell, you dont look sweaty or unclean, you dont follow people around, you know when someone is trying to get away from a conversation
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you are ussually with other friends who arnt in that catagory either, and even when you are not you arent doing the "wandering around looking for pretty girls" thing
I do what I want(tm): Yeah ‚òù
I do what I want(tm): People aren't gonna be like. "Oh that's dudes fat he must be a basement dweller creep"
I do what I want(tm): It's more about who you are
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea thats not what makes a dude creepy, its more about how they interact and you are not like that at all. you know how to hold normal conversation, and you dont overshare
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): when you ask for hall shots you are always polit and normal about it if someone does say know you repect it flat out no questions asked.
I do what I want(tm): Oh yeah over share
I do what I want(tm): Hey nice to meet you
I do what I want(tm): I have a skin condition
I do what I want(tm): Thanks Hazel
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): UGH YEA THAT
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH perfect example of a creep photog was the dude who asked to get a picture of my feet
i knew him and we were already shooting so i kind of went along with it but it struck me as really odd and now he's posting pics from an erotic con on insta
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): omg mawisa no come home so i can save you from creeps
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): that was at zenkai! :3c
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): my first thought was "oh he likes the shoe/sock coordination? wants to use it as inspiration for something?" because I did have sweet socks on and lolita coorders do that all the time but afterwards i was like "lol no that was just weird"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but you didnt know meee yet
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): nooooo jess whyyyyy didn't i know youuuuu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IKR?!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): seriously <@!184437198865563648>  I dont want you to be worried about that. you are not creepy.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): if you think that way we'll beat you up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LMAO <@!351785752197201920>  i just realized you put "thanks hazelnut"
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): THANKS HAZELNUT LMAO
I do what I want(tm): YE
Bill: Subway took forever. Thank jessjess, <@!351785752197201920>. That fears just been a hold over since middle school, back when anime and hentai were considered the same. I don‚Äôt worry about it too much anymore, if not due to own growth due to the fact I‚Äôm usually walking with you Georgia or any of BNE‚Äôs females and that‚Äôs like a ‚Äúnot freak‚Äù badge imo.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea if you are allready with other women than that usually checks off a "safe" in another girls mind, most of the creeps are loners. but i dont think you ned to be worried about it regardless
Bill: ~~Have I told you enough that I don't deserve such a wonderful best friend? Cause I'll do it again.~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
I do what I want(tm): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): o i forgot about this oops. buried in the many tabs of photoshop. i will finish it
I do what I want(tm): Hey it's me! Hi!
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): o yeah i forgot about that too lol
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): it's a picture i had to rotate to introduce myself to a girl a classmate introduced me to for a one-day teaching job
I do what I want(tm): Ooo that makes sense
