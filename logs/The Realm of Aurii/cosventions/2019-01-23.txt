Bill: <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> <@!245270932602486784> <@!301927856240459777> I'm going to write it for Katsu as us (incuding myself and Dave) as one room and the others in the other. If anyone wants to bounce to the other room for more? space? maybe???, you can, but I figure it'll be more fun to have the crew together.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Are we condensing into one room for the last night?
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: I'mma cancel the second room for monday on Friday.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 👍
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Considering Scott doesn’t know anyone and Tristan is awkward, I may bump to their room
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): To break the iceeee
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): We’ll see tho
Bill: I doubt Anna will have them awkward for long.
Bill: Tested flash softbox... Unimpressed. It'd probably cost more to get a refund for, and I'd like to test with a human first, but seems to do nothing for the light quality.
Bill: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs_O2K7H7PO/ ~~That photo is so blurrrrry why would anyone who has a photography account return thattttt~~
Bill: Even as a hall shot *oof*
Bill: @here I'm going to a photo club and they may do reviews of people candid shots. Can't decide on third and final, opinions between these two?
Bill: 
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): bottom one
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yea bottom
N🆗ri (Marisa): first one is really busy and it's hard to tell at a glance what's happening. especially in black and white
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): top is too chaotic
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that top one a pic of katsucon
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The Clamor for the Gazebo, 2018, Black and White
Bill: Hershey at new years.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ahh yes. chocolate. that'll do that to people.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea bottom one
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i like how it has all the primary colors
Bill: Mkay. I wasn't sure if the second was exciting enough. I like the hershey one, but not cropped for printing like you see.
Bill: (I'm bringing prints cause I have no idea how to access their online portal lol)
Bill: my other two are
Bill: 
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): S U S H I
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): first one
Bill: It's three entries.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The NYE, becuase it doesnt have color, and is busy, alot of things get lost.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and yea sushi
Bill: Right, I'm doing the couple, the girl, and the street.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was just commenting on the big sushi :3c
Bill: Holy shit tho luster paper 8.5x11.
Bill: Way to make me look like I know what I'm doing.
Bill: Definitely wish this had been a 'I can't narrow down to 3 from these 12' rather than 'I have 4 good ones I just have to eliminate one' scenario tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): go to touristy areas, or high up and zoom in. that's how i get candid shots
Bill: I'm too shy for street photos.
Bill: Always worried they going to confront me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's why you go somewhere high up or to a touristy area
N🆗ri (Marisa): they can't tell ;3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): like this one, there were 50000 people packed into that tiny shrine taking pictures of every single corner. no one cared about the cameras because they were everywhere
N🆗ri (Marisa): i should find the rest of those.
N🆗ri (Marisa): new york has a lot of touristy areas ya? outside of new york it might be hard though
Bill: Even in New York. Street photography tough, and I haven’t been staying late in nyc much in the last year.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if BNE plans one more theng without anything actually being set imma explode
Bill: Just ignore it until something concrete comes out of it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i think today i learned the plans we're all making won't all come true
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: Well, I'm on Knoebels and I've got a *great* track record.
Bill: ~~I just get very discouraged when the people I'm organizing for are actively interested too~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a bit annoying because i started actively doing research on cream and designing stuff but then realized they were also planning 5 other things
Bill: You want to do boudoir cream?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea basically ignore them until theres actually something solid
Bill: At a minimum, Leanna has her sonic boudoir.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just wanna cosplay with people ;u;
Bill: If you say you're doing it, you've got minimum her and the bandwagon can take affect.
Bill: ❤
Bill: Adorable.
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to heavily pressure everyone
N🆗ri (Marisa): **exerting pressure**
Bill: Most of these people can't plan more than a con in advance really, so planning for *next year Katsu* is pretty out there... I don't have any sway cause I'm not shooting it ~~and if I say 'hey, are we going to do this, am I shooting it' I'll be afraid they'll think I'm a perv~~...
N🆗ri (Marisa): they'd probably come to you anyway for the shoot
N🆗ri (Marisa): i assumed u were the photog
Bill: I don't always assume with BNE... Certainly not with Boudoir.
Bill: They could go to Hunter, whose done more boudoir, has the whole transgender thing to soften the fact he's a dude....
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i never assume with anyone
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i i thought you meant for plans
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): whoops
Bill: Or Rebecca, I believe she's the one doing boudoir for thursday in their room?
Bill: I guess?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea rebeccas shootin some boudoir
Bill: I thought she was going to be in it, but I suppose not.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah that makes sense. everyone human tho we're all just sacks of bones and flesh with consciousness we can't understand
Bill: ~~always assume I'm serious about plans~~
Bill: make Cream (I wrote scream lol) boudoir in the 3 days before Katsu and tell Leanna to bring Sonic.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo maybe idk
N🆗ri (Marisa): o at kotori about the photoshoot thing where we didn't shoot in the morning:
always assume i'm down for shoots because i am literally any time. unless i'm obviously running somewhere to do something else that i've been planning for weeks. but if i'm not doin anything i would love to do a shoot either of myself or take pictures of others.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i may be able to do that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): rather than cream if it's just sonic and one other character would amy be better
Bill: She's friends with clouds of sand photography, maybe Rebecca booked it with her.
Bill: You'd have to talk to her.
Bill: Marisa you ALWAYS running somewhere. XD
Bill: It's fine, just book an hour during daylight for me. Though I have flash now, and it can look pretty good... Not to mention the lights I have in the box still.
Bill: ~~where am I going to store those yikes.~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): why we think we have a balcony: people watching
what we are actually going to have one for extra space
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah you can fit like two people to sleep on the balcony
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh you meant for luggage
N🆗ri (Marisa): that too
Bill: Oh, I meant in my room lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): ceiling
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): facebook wouldn't accept my full nickname smh
Bill: Holy fucker roni.
Bill: Me: these seem like big boxes for bulbs, must have two to a box
Opens box
N🆗ri (Marisa): swirly bois
Bill: Size of my damn forearm.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the bigger the bulb the more light. that's how gravity works right.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh yea they are huge
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Screwing them in is so awkward too
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Well these puppies strong.
Bill: One can get around 3200 iso in a dark room, which is impressive if not quite enough for me to be *happy*.
Bill: If I wasn’t going to this photo club I’d livestream fucking with lights.
N🆗ri (Marisa): do both at the same time
Bill: Naaah. I’m expecting this club to be mostly 50s age people so rip.
Bill: Where them cute photographer girls at?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Become sugar baby
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Find nice midly attractive rich older woman. Live the life
Bill: Is that a typo or like... I’m pretty sure the point of getting a sugar daddy is sacrificing the hot part for the rich part... the scenario you propose is be the rich one.... but don’t get the hot part.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No you get a sugar momma
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Just believe in yourself 🎉
Bill: Oof I make good money thank.
Bill: I’d rather be the rich ugly one who gets the hot girl. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But sugar dadys are old
Bill: Rich old one.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So you'll have to wait like another 30 years
Bill: ~~actually this whole plan is kinda bad, let’s go back to where I meet a nice photographer girl~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🙏
Bill: Not happening of course. My goal is to not sit quietly in the corner the whole time!
Bill: Small things.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> since we were talking about meetup groups, contest for which of us goes to the most meetings of groups. The group no longer counts if you have a friend there.
