Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~giggles~*
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is also about cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): what to do if a bug lands on your prop while painting it:
"Recite the appropriate incantations and offer up this tiny sacrifice to invoke the benevolence of the Project
Gods. Let the paint dry. "
N🆗ri (Marisa): now it's just saying to cover the props in mustard
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah it’s actually really cool. I thought it was crazy but they put globs of mustard over the base coat and then spray the top coat over it and pick off the mustard
N🆗ri (Marisa): *a paper dodecahedron* that's it that's exactly what i was missing for raphtalia <:woah:543194447345876998>

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Stay tuned for choco becoming obsessed with space and Dunkin’ Donuts
Bill: You know I love you, but if she hangs around us at a con I make no promises of being nice.
Bill: Snrk.
Bill: Catch me, as soon as she walks by ~~or more like we hear her coming~~: “APPLEBEES. OH SHIT WERE LATE FOR APPLES AND BEES. RUN NOW”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but then she'd accuse you of bullying for not inviting her
N🆗ri (Marisa): callout post for anyone who goes to applebees
Bill: “No my dear. Bullying would be letting you come to Applebee’s so I can insult you the whole meal”

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And yeah!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Should def do another RWBY sleepover
Bill: We were talking about a mystic messenger one too.
Bill: Though it’s a busy month.
Bill: Once you figure out your internship and where you’ll be we can plan things.
Bill: Though MM doesn’t have much to do with you (rn) so that’s more a plan with Mawisa thing. 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /puts on star wig
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): rika sleepover
Bill: I also figure you’d just want to be included.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Rika sleepover:
Bill: We got Ray/Jaehee, V, Yoosung/Seven/unknown, Rika, Jumin... MC/V/Seven.
N🆗ri (Marisa): sleepovers? 👀
Bill: Technically only missing Zen.
N🆗ri (Marisa): would be neat to do one where the pictures are from MC's perspective
N🆗ri (Marisa): but then also need mc pictures
Bill: So you mean Female marketed pin up?
N🆗ri (Marisa): no not at all, like the camera person is MC's eyes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So just legs and boy on top of her? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): nOoOOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): like stuff like this
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oooooh
N🆗ri (Marisa): or having characters "feed" the camera (like offer a spoon of ice cream) or get ready to throw a pillow
Bill: yeah so female pinup. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:huh:555585958146473984>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh oh! Like that series that bad egg did
N🆗ri (Marisa): i looked them up and found
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://badegg-mm.tumblr.com/post/176284638714/i-made-it-with-a-transparent-card
Aldus Larian (Jess): Some of them are like that anyway. She had them put on transparencies which I thought was really cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH those were big at comiket they're so cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): LIKE THAT YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cute idea!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel like ray would be hard for a sleepover because he's only shown in a formal suit, and jaehee probably never sleeps <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Jaehee can be like... unbuttons the top of her blouse, throws her jacket of the back of the chair and just. Sighs.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You could have him wear like lighter colors! Like pastels or floral prints
Aldus Larian (Jess): Instead of like edgelord pjs
N🆗ri (Marisa): pink boi
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): ray hard to remove from saeran when you do non canon things cuz like same body lol  but it's doable
Bill: I guess you don't need both.
Bill: ~~you could show Unknown by giving him needle marks or something from the elixer and stuff~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Needles?! <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): But you don't inject elixir
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's like a drank
N🆗ri (Marisa): no needle marks only self inflicted scratches
N🆗ri (Marisa): unknown would be identified by his tattoos
Bill: that kind of thing.
Bill: oh true tattoos yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~how about a big obviously old dark scar around his ankle~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's for all version of Saeran tho no just Unknown
Bill: now you're thinking with childhood abuse.
Bill: ~~Low key feeling Suzaku cosplay vibes~~
Bill: Depending on what you’re doing. Like, if you did uniforms or something.
Bill: ~~and also it feels like crashing your couple thing so maybe not~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dooo suzakuuuuu
I can do euphie or nunnally
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sit in a chair with my eyes closed aww yiss
N🆗ri (Marisa): But also. Bloodstained euphie.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess do you have a Cheese-kun?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nuuuu 😭 I've wanted one for years
Aldus Larian (Jess): But they're like $100+
N🆗ri (Marisa): operation get jess a cheese-kun is a go
Elfriede Faun (Tom): CHEESE KUN PLZ
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The movie had a new one
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It had like long ears
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Like kyuubi
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg you can't just CHANGE cheese-kun
N🆗ri (Marisa): so this was a magical girl show in disguise
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lelouch is now a magical girl woo
N🆗ri (Marisa):
