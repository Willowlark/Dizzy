Bill: So I think the problem with Kaminari isnâ€™t the shirt as much as the fucking oversized pants. Which is both good and bad cause not hating the half jacket, but bad cause pants canâ€™t be swapped with jeans.
Bill: Fatgumâ€™s are big too, but heâ€™s supposed to be fat so it worked.
Bill: fuck. I forgot his pants are different between outfits.

Bill: Apparently the 10 inches too big kaminari pants arenâ€™t tailorable. 3 inches max before they donâ€™t look like pants again.
Bill: Not that I can return em lady. ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): Where are they too big
clothes can always be made smaller
Bill: The waist is 10 inches too big lol
Bill: You know huge pants clowns wear that are like bowls held up with suspenders? Thatâ€™s what it looks like if I wear them where I normally wear pants.
Nokri (Marisa): That can be taken in
Nokri (Marisa): I can see why the tailor would decline to do it tho they have good reasons
Bill: Have fun being normies fam <@!351471675843411978> <@!334090409389195266> <@!386874959009415170>
