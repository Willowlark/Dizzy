Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo yea that should work out well! üôè
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Space pants wooosh
Jess it‚Äôs never too late to become an ex homestuck you can start right now
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Georgia are we still shooting together
I recommend getting another photographer too because my pictures suck but if you can‚Äôt find a photog I can be the last option <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): We had something about a shoot right after waking up and getting ready on Saturday? Or maybe I dreamt that
Bill: I remember you talking about it.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> have you actually talked to Annette at all?
Bill: Leanna tells me she and friend need a Katsu room.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have a tiny little bit
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): She is nice her boyfriend is too rambunctious tho
Bill: Oh fuck all. Hopefully friend isn‚Äôt boyfriend.
Bill: I‚Äôve literally never talked to her so talking to her about a room is like? Weird?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wait we're offering them a room I thought they were gonna fill Leanna's spots? I'm so confused
Bill: Different.
Bill: Leanna‚Äôs friends don‚Äôt like that Leanna doesn‚Äôt know Tristan and Hammertime, so they don‚Äôt want to merge with us. Leanna found two friends they do know they might be able to add for their own room. 

Annette must have talked to Leanna and Leanna passed on that Annette and friend are looking for room.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooooo! Ok
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Annette seems cool much quieter than her boyfriend
Bill: Leanna is actually trying to convince her friends.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üôèüôèüôèüôè
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'd love to room with Leanna
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Leanna come to us
Bill: Pray Leanna comes through, she said by tomorrow they should have a plan figured out.
Bill: ~~I don‚Äôt really want to try and contact Annette so imma wait~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Thanks I'll prob go with the last then, the little Bois going back
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye I talked to Annette she‚Äôs nice
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): V shy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That‚Äôs a shame about Leanna‚Äôs group too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yeah we had a conversation about how we've both seen each other like 3 times and know who each other were but been too shy to say hi
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I can vouch for Tristan and Scott but idk if that carries enough weight
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): georgia-chan do you still wanna do a mini-shoot saturday morning
Bill: I already vouched for Tristan, probably seems to be Leanna can‚Äôt.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): formal ball is saturday right?
Bill: Believe so. What I have written down.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i'm making my schedule now i just need to figure out my second costume for saturday
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's not official buts that's what it was last year
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ok i think i have an official rough schedule, until the panels get announced. and i have to talk to a ton of people about meeting up and doing potential shoots.

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): are you doing mina for the pj party or swapping to something else?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): or just taking the body paint off
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm probably gonna do something else after herosuit mina. If I go to pj party I guess I'll do nejeri?? Idk it's so late üò≠
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): oo nejire would be cool!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I might do that if we go

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't know what to wear though üòÇ
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): maybe something based on her dress from the culture festival?

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): After studying it, I‚Äôd rather have a slightly smaller but more intricate prop
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia):

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Awww yeee

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia):

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): omg that's so pure

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's so pure omg

Bill: *excuse me, that's my name*
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): DOPPLEGANGER DOPPLEGANGER
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): 
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): when do you want your $30 photoshoot fee
Bill: Well, I only book hours usually.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i'll send it to your venmo
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): there are a few improv events at kotori
Bill: Alternatively there's ice skating.
Bill: You'd be able to meet everyone in BNE too.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): but i can't waste my ticket
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ice skating is also really far
Bill: ~~it's a cheap ticket, waste it~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): bojo just asked if i was driving to kotoricon myself and i was like "the last time i touched a car was when you dropped me off at the airport pls no"
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): IT'S NOT CHEAP
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): it's made of gold i can not waste it
Bill: ~~if you wanted to go to ice skating I'd skip Kotori myself~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i'd like to go. ice skating is about 80 miles away from my house and i dunno how to ice skate but i'd intended to go to it for years, it just always fell at a bad time.
if there's interest i'll bug jim into letting us use the roller skating rink for another cosplay roller skating at some time
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): if you want to you should go to ice skating do not let me hold you back be free like a butterfly
Bill: You misunderstand, it's not like I want to go to ice skating. I want you to do what you *want*, not feel obligated because I bought tickets on whim.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): lizzy is in her hotel room making things to sell at her magfest artist alley table i'm laughing that's such a mood
i want to learn how to dance and play the violin
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i want my katsucon costumes to be nice i'm so worried they're gonna luck like lucina and every other costume
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i wanna see my cat! üòÑ
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "like every other costume"
so good?
Bill: can confirm, Lucina looked great.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): my costumes suck, lucina's gold trim was all over the place and the bust was a bust
Bill: https://giphy.com/gifs/ceeN6U57leAhi
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ya it was all wrong i should redo it
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i have 2 football field's worth of gold bias tape for katarina and ray, if there's any left over i'll redo lucina
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): my problem is that i rush
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): like akko was made in a day. most costumes were made in a day i should stop doing that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you have a month till katsu after you get home right? and you wont be working?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ye. i'll be job hunting, but mostly i'll be either helping out at the HOA (doing charts and newsletters and easy stuff), helping in the fabric store or with teaching sewing lessons, helping my sister watch her kids, or making stuff to stock in BoJo's store that isn't hair/neck bows. everything else will be spent watching anime and making katsu stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if u do a little everyday then you should be good! im trying to work on stuff a little bit everyday i can after work so i dnt go too crazy
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): YEE ROLLER SKATING
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): WOOO
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): yeah! I know the vague order i'm gonna do stuff in. like, katarina's hoop skirt first, then the rest of the dress over that. gotta figure out when to start doing the accessories because i need to get part of the costume done first, but i can't leave it for the end because resin takes at least 24 hours to dry plus another 24 hours to adhere to whatever surface i glue it to, plus paint and plastic and all that needs to be layered and dry
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i'm just very nervous to be competing again. i wanna make bojo proud and show her i'm not wasting a lot of time and money on bad costumes, that i can actually make something decent, but my confidence is 0. ;u;
Bill: Again, you've... never made a bad costume??
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~what a mood~~
but yea seriously all your costumes are good!
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): all costumes be bad <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: ~~anime is the mistake not cosplay~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): lol shoutout to when i almost got ran over in DC as selkie because my shoes were a bit big
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i invested a little bit in some makeup from amazon for katsu to hopefully get a more masculine look for ray.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): all i've learned so far is bigger eyebrows = manly
Bill: pinnacle of manliness
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): yeah pickle eyebrows is the manliest girl ever
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ~~i have a cosplay of her too~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): if you crop out my face the cosplays i've bought look okay but the handmade ones all have major flaws ü§î
Bill: *the major flaw is you cropped out your face*
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): *my face isn't anime enough*
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i should use these more often
Bill: If you could, would you want to do the sleepover and workshopping at Georgia's Mawisa?
Bill: *hard to imagine you not being jetlagged as hell tbh*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): marisa opperates on her own time plane
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): yeah!!!!
oh it's that weekend though? i don't think i'd be able to if it's next week. ;-;
kotori, and then mmmmmaybe breakfast with my family? idk i hear there's some drama going on between my mother and my sister but i never hear anything from anyone so i'm not sure what's going on.

yes. my timezone is MST
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): meow snooze time
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i was gonna suggest cosplay workshop conference calls but i can imagine that'd just be [the sound of 7 sewing machines running at once]
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): BoJo said I need to increase my confidence but you can‚Äôt increase what doesn‚Äôt exist <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: If THATs not a mood.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): if everyone in the katsu room realizes i suck irl you can bury me in the closet under the hammers
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): HOOKY UPDATED AERSTDJKFL
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i forgot i wanted to cosplay that
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nice Wednesday Adams cosplay
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Actually it's... Nevermind
Bill: ~~Tom and Jess need to be Dani and Dorien~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): pls
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i beg
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's incest
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Although they cute
Bill: Don't kiss them, it fine.
Bill: Tom could pull of Nico too I suppose.
Bill: but cosvention, Alright how about this. Since it's your first event coming back to the states, and you deserve F R I E N D S H I P, I'll come get you and bring you to ice skating, we can do whatever dinner happens (the ruby tuesday thing I suppose?) and then I'll drop you back off to your house. If I'm going back to Georgia's that's no more than I drive for work.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): omg that's so far though
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): and the ticket
Bill: For the last time I really don't care Marisa.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i don't want to make things hard for anyone, i can see everybody at katsu!
Bill: The only way you make this *hard* is by not being honest about what you'd like to do.
Bill: If you want to see BNE, rather than the crappy panels at Kotori, lets DO THAT.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i am very nervous about meeting bne i feel like they won't like me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): MARISA NO EVERYONE WILL LOVE U
Bill: EVERYONE WUV YOU.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): a lot of them aren't following me on instagram and they're already so close with each other i'd feel like i'm intruding ;u;
Bill: Ice Skating's EVEN BETTER for meeting them than Katsu cause Katsu everyone heckin busy and here they'll have time to fawn over you.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): [collapses in the middle of the ice rink] "sup"
Bill: *20/10 adorable*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea ice skating is great for everyone to meet each other!  ~~esspecially if you are like me and hang out on the side line half the time~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i'd have to see what's happening with my family if they ever respond to my messages, because i think they were going to have a welcome back breakfast for me? but maybe not because my sister was planning something else the morning after kotori?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): cheerleader jess
Bill: That's fine. Wouldn't need to leave till around 2, you can have breakfast with your fam *and kitty*.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): sylvia!!!! üòÑ
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): o it'd be on sunday?
Bill: No, this saturday.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ye the breakfast would be for early sunday ;~; my family gets up at like 4am somehow and eats breakfast at like 5/6
Bill: yeah, I'm saying I'd bring you back saturday night.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): not bojo and i. it'll be like 6pm and i'd be like "breakfast time"
Bill: It's a straight shot on the turnpike between Georgia and Cherry Hill area.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): oo i used to live in cherry hill
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): hmmmm. I really do appreciate the offer, and I would love to go to ice skating and see everybody, but I feel bad about making you drive so much and i am very nervous because i suck. I also dont want to waste the kotoricon ticket because it's an important gift. I'll find everyone at katsu and give them stickers and admire them from afar, if I can still bum a ride to katsu from someone and pay them for gas.
Bill: so you'll be home saturday night for your family day sunday, you'll get the full ***FRIENDSHIP*** experience saturday, and everything will be good.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): but so far away
Bill: Marisa I drive 160 miles to Armonk one to twice a week. The rest of the time I commute 60 to NYC by train.
Bill: If I had a problem with offering, I *wouldn't have*.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): enjoy your last event without me mucking it up ;3c
Bill: So no more feeling bad, and just let me do something nice for you.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): you did kotoricon!!! that was nice!!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this is like the battle of the century
Bill: ~~That was when I thought everyone would GO to Kotoricon~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): unstoppable force vs immovable object
Bill: Georgia got everyone to go Ice Skating so QED.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~tom and i will prob do whatever mawisa is doing~~
Bill: Huzzah!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tom confirm or deny

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i've always wanted to visit greenland
Bill: *But you're being difficult and not telling us what you want to do*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yer well prob do whatever you do, unless what you want to do is nothing
Bill: We've missed you Mawisa, we just want to spend time with you.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Then we'll just show up at your house
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i'll go to kotori and see everyone at katsu! don't change your plans for me and do what you want to do the most. i don't want to inconvenience anyone. my suitcase will still be packed up so i won't have souvenirs ready to give to people at kotoricon
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): there's no room in my house oh no we'll all have to sit on the lawn
Bill: *My pan is to do what you want to do most damnit*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): We'll sit on the pile of stuff that's fine
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): spending time with me will involve wearing ladder shades and sitting silently in a circle pondering life
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sounds lit
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i'm very boring
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i can show you how my thumb goes far back we can look at our thumbs
Bill: You've *never* been boring.

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont really get puffy my eyes are just deep set
Bill: Oh, so I assume you saw the "Duke cannon bloody knuckle cream" I posted about in story yesterday?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YE
Bill: With a name like that I'd assume it's crappy lotion just marketed for dudes to buy.
Bill: It works *really* fucking well tho.
Bill: I'm legitimately surprised.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): have u ever used working hands? im assuming its prob simular
Bill: Nah. Used a bunch of things last year that didn't really work... I have that now, which is great, and ~~3 whoops~~ bath and body works aroma scents.
