Nokri (Marisa): Oh noooo a chinese cosplayer was really harassed at Comiket by photographers. Poor girl
Nokri (Marisa): Photographers caused a lot of issues this year
Nokri (Marisa): She was crying and scared of the photogs and trying to get away but people were still trying to get low-angle shots anyway

Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): That’s so sad
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ://///
Nokri (Marisa): They should have stayed way back, like this
Nokri (Marisa): I wonder if there were communication issues which led to the problem, like if people didn’t understand when she said no or asked them to back off. Or if they were taking advantage of her being foreign and pretending not to understand
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg. Poor girl
Nokri (Marisa): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🤑
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I don't remember that SnK outfit 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): I’ve seen it for like $5 online
Nokri (Marisa): She’s got a jacket *over* the printed jacket on the suit aaaaa
Nokri (Marisa): Ooomg so every year a bunch of people faint at Comiket, it’s a common occurrence. But there’s video of this one guy being loaded into the back of an ambulance after passing out, and shouting at his friend “go buy the Enkan doujinshi, I need you to buy it for me”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmfao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Onggg
Nokri (Marisa): anna is trying to convince me to wear my cat underwear as blake's swimsuit for cce <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): HOW
Nokri (Marisa): HOW LEWD?
Nokri (Marisa): IM SCERFM
Nokri (Marisa): existential lewd crisis
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because even though it literally covers the same as a bikini, wearing underwear in public is frowned upon <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): valid
Nokri (Marisa): im a heaten
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, aren't they like, regular underwear material? That would probably not be comfortable to get wet?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah but she said i don't need to go in the water at all
i could add a waterproof lining to the inside though that wouldn't do much at all
Nokri (Marisa): if i do that i'm probably gonna cover up the cat cut-out on the chest with purple or somethin
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh its not bathing suit material? I always thought it was for some reason
Nokri (Marisa): nah it's just plain fabric that's why it was like less than $5
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ooooo yeah that's would make sense
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Noone would know but you ofc but I'd understand why it would feel uncomfortable for the same reasons that Erik said 👌
Nokri (Marisa): but why go in water? 😃
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *for fun*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Is warm water!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yasha from crit role has such a cool design but damn I don’t listen to the podcast
