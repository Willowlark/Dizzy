Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48051911438_fae3b26c27.jpg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this would be my fav but i didnt paint my hands thicc enough
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~bill would it actually be okay if someone did a paint touch up on my hands~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and thus i have been able to catch up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thank you bill üôè
Bill: You are further welcome. It‚Äôs okay if you want to have someone touch up the hands. 

The piccolo stuff is my favorite personally, particularly while sitting. The wall lights were neat, but I needed to do them as well as Taiyang‚Äôs or Yang‚Äôs.
Bill: And thank for the head tilt comment in particular. I know what you like with stuff after all this time.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.instagram.com/p/Bya5QdMAXvX/?igshid=egjtus3dbfum
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Well, less than 2 weeks, but still excite
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'd like the picolo ones more if my eyes didn't look so weird
Bill: I has box from China I might have had kaminari and fatgum for tomorrow wrong!
Bill: Let it rip or time to duel you decide.
Nokri (Marisa): i found pictures of charlotte dressed as blake, which would explain why courtney was at the rwby shoot, and they look a little similar so maybe you saw charlotte as blake and got her confused with courtney
Nokri (Marisa): silver rectangle
Nokri (Marisa): she‚Äôs really cool
Bill: 
Bill: The knobby bits on the knee pads are barely glued on but that‚Äôs (probably) an easy fix.
Bill: 
Bill: The gloves are the evil kind I can‚Äôt use a touch screen with.
Nokri (Marisa): that's all gloves
Bill: Kaminari is. Not very good.
Nokri (Marisa): oo they based it off the first google image eh
doesn't look too bad aside from jacket length. u can snip that loose thread.
Bill: The tank top barely covers my cut, the belt too wide to stay on...
Bill: And they did the pants as if I was going to wear them over my gut.
Bill: Which is not my favorite look.
Nokri (Marisa): isn't that how you're supposed to wear pants
that's yer waist
Bill: I look like egg man.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I dont think it looks bad??
Bill: Correct, except my waist turns me into a egg. So I don‚Äôt wear pants like that.
Andrew: looks ok to me
Bill: It‚Äôs... okay.
Bill: Not great.
Nokri (Marisa): it's better than all my costumes
Nokri (Marisa): jacket is better with the waist up properly also
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I like the jacket ngl
Bill: Jacket definitely best part!
Bill: Hush Marisa.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea!
Andrew: Dare i say it looks...electric
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *boogie woogie woogie*
Bill: 
Andrew: yoooo
Bill: The foam armor belt thing looks better... still wants to be at guy height.
Bill: I‚Äôm still not really a fan... I hate having my pants rise that high... if I replace the tank top, maybe I can make the whole thing come together a little better.
Bill: Not a v neck but a white shirt and that‚Äôs an improvement.
Bill: And with the belt alone set higher.
Bill: That I think I can make work... I might have to effort tho.
Bill: The half jacket is not a good look for me cause a full jacket hides my weight better, this kinda accentuates it.
Bill: I think that‚Äôs what it comes to.
Bill: But I have it! And it does technically fit!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think they both look pretty good
