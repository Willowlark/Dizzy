NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): can't wait to go to Nautical Nonsense: A look into Japanese Naval History and the Anime It Spawned 3 times
Dirty Lego (Tom): Are you fit to be hentai'd?
Bill: ~~While the RWBY improv panel is terrible specific, I mean, there's like three zelda lore panels~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): a lot of the zenkaikon staff are older and not very in touch with what's popular among fandom unless they've heard it 90000 times, which is why there's naruto and a lot of nostalgia panels
Bill: would also explain `Otaku Parenting: How to Share Your Fandom with Your Family
`.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Update log 413
I ran out of bobbin thread and didnâ€™t feel like replenishing it so I moved on to the shoes. Plastic is not stable enough to form a base by itself with the tools available to me. I started dismantling existing shoes to use as a guide that Iâ€™ll stick the plastic to. Scissors and exacto knives arenâ€™t sharp enough so I need to find industrial wire cutters.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Biru do you keep a running list of Instagram tags I use for you because I canâ€™t remember if Iâ€™ve used one before or not
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Iâ€™ll just use a definitely new one
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): O you canâ€™t see your logo on dark backgrounds heads up
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): darn I went back and looked. I already used rikki tikki tltwm thatâ€™s a good one
Bill: Nope. I need to make one, but I don't know whose posts to go through and I have to do it manually cause insta doesn't have an API and I haaaaate that.
Bill: *who the fuck do you think comments on these stupid lineup posts?*

*Photographers*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ussually other cosplayers looking to meet up
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Somebody give that cosplayer some grapes
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): M.......maternity....? Of a high school character..............?
*maternity of a literal child......?*
Is this person ok
Dirty Lego (Tom): HMMM
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'm guessing there just pregnant
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye they are
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but prob should have picked a diff character
