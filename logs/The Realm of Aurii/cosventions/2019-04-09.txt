Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how much different is sakura?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I could take Marisa home
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That cuts out probably most of the trip
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause I go at least to Edison for skool, but I don’t mind a road trip with Marisa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just have to be back at cool leg by 10

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): guessing this would not be a cosplay thing tho lol
Bill: nope.
Bill: lol I never got to the book store cause I got a message from work (I was fucking around getting home on a friday) that needed my attention so I had to rush home.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): where is your house jess
Aldus Larian (Jess): sparta
Bill: I'll be around, though if we aren't drinking I may sneak home at the end of the night.
N🆗ri (Marisa): gvhbjnafgrh i told you my house was out of the way
if we don't plan on going to sakura sunday i can return home with bojo on saturday
what do we do with the costumes tho
Bill: Ssssh. You don't get a say in this Mawisa.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm just planning on driving back so I'd probably leave from wherever no later than 10ish and I wasn't sure how late we were staying at Kogara
N🆗ri (Marisa): kogara ends at 8
N🆗ri (Marisa): most panels are done by 7
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh Sparta is definitely not on my way home from Kogara lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): sunday is currently showers after 5pm
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaa i didnt think so
N🆗ri (Marisa): if the weather forecast gets worse: indoor cosplay party. we draw cherry blossoms on scrap paper and scatter them around for dramatic effect.
Bill: Tom and Jess *do* have those cherry blossoms...
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have 500 fake cherry blossoms
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's fate
Bill: Still can do mitsuwa on top of that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): id say to just pick one event
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and do mitsuwa another weekend when we all need something to do
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): plus i think the book store is closed sundays so it might be better to go on a saturday
Bill: oh yeah. Def don't want to do it if stuff is closed.
Bill: ~~plus if we go on a saturday there's the karaoke place that's byob and we can coordinate around that~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~TRUE~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _garrity breakfast? Owo_
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Owo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so the plan for this weekend as i understand it: squad goes to kogaracon, im at work, i rendezvous with yall at the garritys where some people are sleeping over
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if weather good, we all go to philly together until [time] pm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if weather bad we go to a con, two cars, and the southern car (me and marisa) can leave from there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): is there any merit to me saving time by taking the train from woodbridge to sparta if weather is bad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i dont have to go all the way back up and down
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~is there a train station in sparta?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): No 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): There's one in Dover which is like 2? 3? towns over
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): damn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause rutgers rocky horror is at 10 pm and im going cause justin is brad
Bill: Yeah, no don't train. That seems like a mess.
Bill: Yes, though depending when we leave Kogara I guess we could have dinner by Kogara?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I already looked into dinner
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there's a Chili's 15 minutes away
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there's actually like 3 that are relatively equidistant away
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881> <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881> <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's the second con?
Bill: Marisa con?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i didn't prepare a costume for that
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds gross
N🆗ri (Marisa): the weather for sunday isn't looking too bad but if it is bad i don't want anyone going 2+ hours out of their way for me
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh i see, the north jersey weather is super different from the philly one. does that make a difference? the north jersey weather says it's gonna rain from like 10am but the philly one says it won't rain until like 6pm now
Bill: We aren't going out of our way. Going out of our way is having to drive down sunday morning to pick you up again and drive back because you're being silly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone will be though. i already feel bad for imposing overnight. how much is gas right now i can pay that
Bill: Marisa in order to impose, you have to be the one asking. You aren't. Tom, Jess, and I *(and I don't even live there)* have all **invited** you to stay there. That makes you a party guest.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i guess we should make party hats
N🆗ri (Marisa): here's a list of party games we could try
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Games_(Bruegel)#The_games
Bill: apparently we need to play never have I ever since your other servers are doing that.
Bill: ,... I only skimmed the stuff about goal cannibalism, but that was where it started from right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): YE we can do that online
Bill: Or.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the cannibalism was unrelated
Bill: Oh okay.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the staff surveys from our department head at zenkaikon aren't anonymous and i don't like that
N🆗ri (Marisa): i see how it helps to not be anonymous but i'm afraid of making people angry
N🆗ri (Marisa): if sakura sunday is a bust can andru still join whatever is happening
we're supposed to hang out with him at sakura sunday
andru will you still go to sakura sunday if it's rainy?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think he already bought a ticket
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YeJ don't wanna leave the boi out, but it sounds like we might be okay
Aldus Larian (Jess): Weather forecast, please get better <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Bill: Andrew has an open invitation to come to north jersey anytime.
Bill: He just gotta do it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What's the ghost for? <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): IM SO HYPE FOR MARISA TO COME OVER
Bill: Teruteru bozu!
Bill: Also maybe there’s something in south jersey phiiiiiliiiiinah to do.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru understood that reference <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
