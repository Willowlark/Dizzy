Aldus Larian (Jess): I not in your room but I come visit!
Nokri (Marisa): Come meme!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *what's Saturday night?*
Nokri (Marisa): Are we not doing mystic mess anymore :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): WE DEF DOING IT
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think we were doing like around 4? Or 5? Fuck I can't remember
Nokri (Marisa): see y'all at 4 or 5 <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): surprised no one's going to the rwby panel then
Nokri (Marisa): or are people going to that afterwards
Aldus Larian (Jess): There's a RWBY panel? ðŸ˜®
Nokri (Marisa): ya at 6 <:Shooketh_Honda_San:605590718026874901>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo I didn't know that
Nokri (Marisa): *memorize the schedule*
Nokri (Marisa): THIS CANTI COSPLAYER HAS A WORKING SCREEN ON THEIR FACE THAT PLAYS PARTS OF THE ANIME
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg that's so cool
Nokri (Marisa): are CCE panels usually a good size? crowd-wise? are the rooms tiny like they are at kogaracon or kotoricon
Nokri (Marisa): also is the registration line long on friday does anyone know
how many hours will it take
Nokri (Marisa): 7.5 is my record
Aldus Larian (Jess): I've never seen the reg line long at all I dont think<:minathink:544567715931750405>
Nokri (Marisa): they never released their attendance numbers so it's really hard to gauge how crowded it is
Nokri (Marisa): i think my plans are currently:

Friday:
wear Manaka to the con. reg line, then survey the convention if i have time. take selfies in manaka in the pool if possible, probably not. Name That Tune at 2, im doing a shoot for someone at 3, then change into Spinel. Go to Dan's panel, the Homestuck panel, and the Anime Theme Song concert. take selfies as Spinel. Go to Sketch and Chill, So You Think You're a Weeb, I Speak Nerd.

Saturday:
Wear either Rin or Ruby (leaning towards Rin because my ruby cape is dirty). Maybe go to Nintendo's Greatest Commercials. Go to Dan and Jillian's panel, Tame that Tune, the Kimono panel. Change into Jaehee. Go to masquerade. Change into Morgiana. Karaoke, Sketch and Chill, mmmmmaybe the military panel if i can stay up.

Sunday: Wear Katara. Check the flea market. I should probably see the dealers room and artist alley. Try and get autographs. Name that Tune, Videogame Commercials, Feedback Panel or whenever Andru decides to leave.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~if anyone wants to help me take selfies i can give you crackers~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Busy gorl!
Nokri (Marisa): really? :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye u busy gorl
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Nokri (Marisa): i wanna get my money's worth outta the con :mew:
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea das smart.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): LORD CANTI
Bill: i cosplay a lot of villains i think
Nokri (Marisa): claude, mirio, v, thor. major villains.
Nokri (Marisa): oh and we can't forget the biggest bad of them all
*the pilot*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: Hazel and Ikuto. Talked about how the only student that would fit me from RWBY is Cardin.
Nokri (Marisa): ikuto's not really a villain
Bill: ~~V is a villain if you ask Ray fangirls :3~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): No he's noooot! ðŸ˜­
Aldus Larian (Jess): Morally gray maybe, not a villian
Bill: teasing. I dunno why i gotthe idea though, I'm not actually doing more Villains
Nokri (Marisa): so the lots of villains you've cosplayed is hazel?
Bill: ðŸ¤”
Nokri (Marisa): oh yeah that guy from angel beats. huge villain too. man you're just a walking antagonist.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ya I think it's just hazel
Bill: I just said I donâ€™t know why I had the thought cause I realize Iâ€™m not...
Nokri (Marisa): sorry, we just goofin around
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok just gotta pack tolietress tomorrow and I'm good <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: I didnâ€™t pack at all oops
Nokri (Marisa): i still don't fully know what i'm wearing haha rip
Nokri (Marisa): well there's no reason for me to wear ruby so if i wear rin then i guess i know what i'm wearing
Nokri (Marisa): hey guys i fully know what i'm wearing haha
Nokri (Marisa): anna said recently she didn't know i cosplay ruby. i think i was such a bad ruby at konkon that people in bne have forgotten <:rip:369476083248267274>
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Anna wasn't at kon Kon tho
Nokri (Marisa): tru but i've never been asked to do ruby again. maybe it's because i'm too far away or i only have volume 1 version but my mind's gonna wallow in self loathing and self embarrassment anyway hey-o
Nokri (Marisa): i only lucked out as the group ruby because i was the first to claim it
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Heyoo, but o thinks it's because while you were away the hype for rent died down
Nokri (Marisa): o yeah i was away for a year <:woah:543194447345876998>
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Nah there isn't any rwbys among our groups other than like Jessie
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): That smol detail
Nokri (Marisa): reiley is a good ruby too i think
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oh true tru
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I forgot about that
Nokri (Marisa): anna was saying they're canon height but i think i'm the same size
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Rei did ughhh
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oscar!
Nokri (Marisa): o i'm shorter than canon ruby height rip

Nokri (Marisa): they were cute
Nokri (Marisa): i feel bad for taking ruby from them at konkon
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Nah, they did rwby at any and wanted to do Oscar anyways
Nokri (Marisa): i'll live up to my reputation and build a fursuit and never show my face again
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): ðŸ¤”
Nokri (Marisa): not a furry tho just gonna wear a fursuit
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Understandable
