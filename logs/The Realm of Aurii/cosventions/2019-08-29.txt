ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Shit I forgot to grab the pictures when I got home ***again***
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <@184437198865563648>  idk when ima do it yet or **if** I'm going to, I still have to figure out my lineup for cce. But IF I end up bringing my OC would you wanna shoot it in the arcade?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH <@!334090409389195266> do you wanna get some swim Kiribaku photos too?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ohhh yea! Definitely!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ðŸ’¥ âš™
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I'll be in Baku like 90%of Friday
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Kiri's all I got planned for Friday
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Woo! Ok we can def work it out
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I went to get coffee this morning and Africa was playing on the radio so now I'm hype for cce more than normal
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): for your OC you can go to that VR area with the guns that we went to for our awful Darling shoot that Snow never returned photos for
Nokri (Marisa): what made it awful? :0
Kaio Vermino (Lee): OH SHIT THATS TRUE that would be really cool
Nokri (Marisa): are swimsuit cosplays allowed outside of the waterpark?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea they're allowed everywhere
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Unless you're dripping wet
Nokri (Marisa): o sweet <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Sure Lee. Know what day?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Either Friday or sunday..... or ....Thursday  but idk if I wanna commit to a Thursday cosplay xD
Bill: We can do Kiribaku too. I could wear pieces of Fatgum to swim Fatgum with your Kiri if I don't do Claude.
Bill: or do Claude partially.
Bill: That works.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ooooo fatgum
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Claude is nice though bshshjs. Whichever you chose I'm sure itll be fun
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Glad you're cosplaying more now, you get to experience the fun even more now!
Bill: I don't know of any fire emblem meetups, and considering this whole thing is just going to be a jacket and swim trunks... Be easy to pack both.
Bill: Well, the fun is doing groups so.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): .... I mean true
Bill: As long as I can do stuff with people.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Still!
Bill: I also have like, no shoots. So I just wanna hang around with everyone and might as well in cosplay.
Bill: Oh right, Fatgum requires wog if I don't wear the hood.
Bill: bleh.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so is there a way to link your own credit card to your wristband?
Bill: Not unless it's new this year.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Damn
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): rip
Bill: We had them all enabled last year, and... tried to figure out what was what at the end.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): are you planning to do that again?
Bill: Ya. Maybe not all of them, just whoever wants to.
Bill: I'll bring it up in the facebook chat lat.er
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea if we do that we should try to remember to keep track
Nokri (Marisa): what do the wristbands do?
Bill: Charge to the room.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And get you into the waterpark
Bill: They also are your room key and ^
Nokri (Marisa): oo you have to pay to get into the waterpark? i thought they were included
Bill: Nope.
Bill: Except for the night swim.
Nokri (Marisa): nope to being included, or nope to paying?
Nokri (Marisa): i'll scrap most of my swim cosplays if that's the case
Kaio Vermino (Lee): They are included, night swim is extra
Bill: Nope to paying.
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooooo
Bill: Night swim was 20 bucks I think a night.
Nokri (Marisa): then why would we need to hook up a card to the wristband? :0
Kaio Vermino (Lee): It's more this year I think
Bill: For the bars.
Bill: You can charge anything bought in the hotel to the room, with a wristband that has that enabled.
Nokri (Marisa): <:rapid:607237006539489310> 
workout bars? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: It then gets charged at the end of the stay.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its not just for bars, its an easy way of purchasing anything in the resort while you may be ina  bathing suit/not have wallet on you
Bill: ^
Nokri (Marisa): i think the night swim is $30 this year or something and $50 for both days, i was looking at that the other day which is why i got confused a moment ago
Bill: It's pretty convenient, but you have to keep track of when you buy stuff cause it's one massive bill.
Nokri (Marisa): if there are like 5 purchases for pringles and soup it's probably me <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): omg i ate a hot pocket yesterday and it didn't have a sleeve to put it in, and i got really emotional because "it's a hot pocket without the pocket...... it's just a hot"
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: So right now, potentially Arcade shoot for Lee's OC, kiribaku? and MM.
Bill: That right?
Bill: Cept someone else needs to shoot MM, so Lee gunna do it or we'll... idk, recruit someone. We have a lot of friends at CCE.
Nokri (Marisa): YOOOO WE GOT A MICROWAVE?
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE
Aldus Larian (Jess): either is fine with me with the shoot
Nokri (Marisa): YOOO I DON'T EVEN NEED TO BUY ANYTHING I CAN BRING MY SOUP WITH ME AND EAT IT **WARM**
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): You can still pay without the bands too
Bill: ^
Bill: Whatever we have is what we'll do cause I need to learn to clone myself.
Bill: ~~I'm not terribly interested in paying Hunter/Rebecca~~
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Yeah I should buy some microwave stuff
Bill: David shoots, though I never got Hazel stuff back from him, and I think Chris (Gen's) is trying to do photos too.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WILL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WILL SHOOTS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And he's also looking for photoshoot opps to help pay for CCE because of his car situation
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait he does mostly video shoots
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Unrelated but Clifford is almost done and I've been  walking around my house for the past hour in a furry swimsuit 
Send help.
Bill: So.... call... Jack?
Nokri (Marisa): THAT'ES YOUR COSPALY?y?? CLIFFORD THE BIG REF DOG??????
Nokri (Marisa): fgdhjkh.;ljkhgjyhftgdrfeds

Nokri (Marisa): wot
Bill: Wow.
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg thats amazing
Bill: That is a thing.
Bill: Nice work.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I love it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): best Kaiju
Kaio Vermino (Lee): 
Bill: ~~donâ€™t look at bumble any differently now~~
Bill: The doll lollll
Nokri (Marisa): what was that about furries
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I straight up am just becoming a furry
Nokri (Marisa): ~~if you want a good borderline furry manga i can recommend you one i found the other day but note i am not a furry~~
Bill: ~~you can be honest we already know~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yes rec me it
Nokri (Marisa): it's called Kainushi Juujin to Pet Joshikousei and it's about a girl who finds herself in a world where humans are pets and animals are the people
it sounds messed up but it is wholesome
Nokri (Marisa): she's a cat person though
Kaio Vermino (Lee): :o
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ima read it
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Bless
Nokri (Marisa): BLESS
Nokri (Marisa): ~~also beastars is really really really good if you like realistic zootopia~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): O3O I'll go look at that one too
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): NICE
Bill: wow that could easily be *really* fucked up.
Bill: Literally has "Pet Schoolgirl" in the title. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): yeah she's a pet
what kind of sicko pet owners do you know
Bill: ~~Jumin han~~
Nokri (Marisa): does he ever call MC his pet? <:thinku:543194478614413318> he treats her more like a possession
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): >posts line-up stating not bringing any actual cosplays
>decides I might be interested in shooting a video with Will
>guess I'm bringing hero suit Kirishima to CCE too
Bill: well, you wanna help him out too.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Bill: Doing a Claude shoot at this waterfall we never go to would be cool ~~especially if I smuggled my bow there~~ but smuggling my bow is a bad idea (can always go to buttermilk falls with it instead) and once again who.
Nokri (Marisa): will trade photoshoot for photoshoot if the waterfall is a good spot
Bill: No idea, we've never made it out there.
Bill: But also think having the bow is going to make it a lot better and I'm not going to bring that to CCE.
Nokri (Marisa): YOOOOOOOOOO
Nokri (Marisa): it looks awesome
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea everything nice seen from there is really pretty. I never feel like my cosplays fit a waterfall tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yesterdays insta post is doing better than anything has in like 2 months wtf
Bill: 2B Yukata would have but weather.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
Nokri (Marisa): if we can't make it on thursday, know that i will be cosplaying alone at home anyway
Bill: You can also see if Allison/Nick can give you a ride. I told that to Andrew yesterday on overwatch.
Nokri (Marisa): that would be great <:woah:543194447345876998>
i don't know nick though and tiny kaichou is too cool i'm intimidated
Nokri (Marisa): tiny kaichou come here
Nokri (Marisa): so i can grovel and beg if you have room
Bill: They aren't coming till thursday night either though so.
Nokri (Marisa): that's still thursday tho
Andrew: If we can fit with them ill see what I can do.
Andrew: about thursday.
Bill: Or see what your car can do.
Andrew: Like I said im going to the shop at the end of the week.
Nokri (Marisa): we got the guts cleaned out of ours as best we could ;u;
it must really be jammed in there though because it still smells
Andrew: Mine is just falling apart. It had an overheating problem a couple weeks ago so
Andrew: Aand as youve seen i dont have a front seat lol.
Bill: you worry about that part way too much lol
Andrew: Its just awkward loll
Andrew: John sat down one time and it just snapped
Nokri (Marisa): ye, is fine, ours is also constantly overheating <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): we can take public transit, it'll only take 12.5 hours
Andrew: Oh god no
Nokri (Marisa): oof yeah nvm one bus alone will be $35
Nokri (Marisa): didn't even check the other bsues
Bill: at that point you could rent a car.
Nokri (Marisa): aren't cars like hundreds of dollars to rent?
Bill: Not sure, but I don't think so.
Nokri (Marisa): they expense
Nokri (Marisa): it'd be double that per day of the convention to rent a car
Bill: it's like 35 bucks.
Bill: A day.
Nokri (Marisa): where?
Bill: Enterprise. They're going to charge you another 80 bucks for being under 25 though.
Nokri (Marisa): there you go. that's over $200 then
Bill: It's only more practical than taking a bus.
Nokri (Marisa): so much more expensive
Bill: The one bus was the same price...
Bill: w/e. It exists.
Bill: <@!334090409389195266> when would you do your OC? AM or PM?
Bill: if friday, rather than sunday.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh woops didnt see that. If I do Friday its gonna be AM I think I gotta double check all the bnha meetup times though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 2 I think? Could be wrong
Nokri (Marisa): i think i tore apart my holo wig for raphtalia
so
i'm gonna uhhh
take taiga's wig and straighten it and add selkie's ears on top. yeah. messing up more costumes to fix one should do the trick.
Andrew: I'm gonna put together a pool naofumi.
Andrew: And thinking about all might
Nokri (Marisa): this wig has broken two brushes so far
Nokri (Marisa): you know what
Nokri (Marisa): [fills bathtub with water and conditioner]
i'm washin' me AND my wig
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hell yes! Now that's what I can efficiency
Nokri (Marisa): Yarrr
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Make sure you wear clothes too so you can do your laundry as well!
Nokri (Marisa): GOOD POINT
Nokri (Marisa): Iâ€™ll just jump in like this then
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): If anyone ever needs yellow paracord I gotchu
Nokri (Marisa): uuugjugh I am weak

The ends will just have to suffer
Nokri (Marisa): ew

Nokri (Marisa): no i'm in the picture
Nokri (Marisa): happily goin through pictures then BAM ugly
Nokri (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I was hoping you wouldn't say that
Nokri (Marisa): Chrysalis and her changling army's power is transforming into other people to blend in because her and the changelings are considered ugly by pony standards <:pew:543202259085950996>
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I honestly know nothing about mlp xD
Nokri (Marisa): i don't think i've seen that episode specifically, i've only seen a few movies and the first 5 seasons <:thinku:543194478614413318>
