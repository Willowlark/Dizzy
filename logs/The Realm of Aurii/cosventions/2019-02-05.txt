Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Piece of what?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Put the wrong piece on a set on eyelet pliers and had to take it off
N🆗ri (Marisa): Costly mistake
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo nooo
Dirty Lego (Tom): 
Dirty Lego (Tom): When you buy a pattern
Dirty Lego (Tom): And realize weeks later wat you have done
Dirty Lego (Tom): For the record
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'm am none of these sizes
Dirty Lego (Tom): To be clear
Bill: That much has always been clear.
Bill: I’m surprised patterns exist for 3x.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Only thing to do is keep going up
N🆗ri (Marisa): Make it bigger

Also I should totally make up a card of dead people. It'd be just 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wh
What
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wat
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think he’s gonna kill us
N🆗ri (Marisa): Business card hotlist
Bill: Funeral Pyrrha and dead 2B with Nines over her.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): business card more like CALLING CARD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  do this look accurate?
N🆗ri (Marisa): WOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): suit up y’all
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Good thing I had that bracelet laying around
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *working on saeran's jacket*
*Watching "inside the mind of kidnappers"*
"Appropriate!"
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wow a whole documentary on saeran
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "children who aren't allowed to leave, or feel trapped in their own home, are more likleunto become kidnappers" 👀👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can’t wait to become a kidnapper like saeran
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Do you think Mary Jane type shoes would work for MC?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Im terrible in heels and I don't wanna have to buy them anyway
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeeeee
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hmm. The mint eye group is a bit formal in style, do you have any dressy flats or wedding style sandals? The Mary Janes could work if not
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have my wedding flats but they are white, I might have a pair of strappy silver low heels?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Don’t be uncomfortable tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I wore them to prom with a 4 inch slice in my foot and they were so so I'd imagine they'd be ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): Were giant gashes in style
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nah, someone opened a metal door into my foot the week before prom <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my friend drove me to the hospital, but i didnt need stiches, then it got infected but somehow cleared up enough before prom with ✨ antibiotics ✨
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@!184437198865563648>  is it ok if i finish up your cards in the morning, my computer doesnt have the font i used so I'd have to pick a new one "sob
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s a really good font I recommend
N🆗ri (Marisa): You should try it
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s used in a lot of advertising by small businesses I really think it’s an up and coming trend
N🆗ri (Marisa): That font is called
N🆗ri (Marisa): comic sans
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Won’t you try just give it a chance
You might find that you’ll start to understand
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||those are lyrics from a mlp song||
Bill: Yeah, probably guessed by I already went to bed.
Bill: hopefully expedited shipping will get them by Katsu. I don't even know. No big loss if not, having a better design is worth wait.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its uploading now, just taking forever cuz my internet at work is terrible
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@!184437198865563648>  whats your email?
Bill: willowlark@outlook.com
Bill: wait, can you upload pdf's to Moo?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what do you need for vista?
Bill: No idea, I was going to use moo... though I suppose I should price shop, since it's the one set.
Bill: Vista cheaper. It wants an image, and while I tried the pdf it complains about file size.
Bill: ye so image export, png or jpg will probably work fine.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its prob still gonna complain about size, what size does it want?
Bill: less than 32mb?
Bill: * 38.
Bill: Should be fine.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): .png s are RBG only itll have to be jpeg or tiff
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): jpeg in folder
Bill: that worked.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cool
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they're 300ppi so they should be good
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sometimes i go overboard XD
Bill: never a bad thing with image quality 👌
Bill: Sweet, standard shipping is by next tuesday.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nicu
Bill: The safety lines were a tad generous on vista, but the previews look good.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: In the preview it was cutting off your forehead.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do you need me to move the image down?
Bill: nah it look good. Vista just must be conservative with design space in their editor.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea they are just covering their asses
Bill: Already ordered. 👌 THANK JESS
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you welcome!
Bill: The big circle could look neat on a square card... Not that I need it but it'd be a cool design.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): omg im trying to uploas allt he files to dropbox and its gonna take like 30 mins
Bill: Y I K E S.jpg
Bill: Not that I'd know what to do with illustrator files.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they for me.
Bill: oooh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they're just going in that folder
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ugh I love seeing the masquerade but like
I’m not gonna sit there for four hours Lizzy why is it so long
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what are you in?
N🆗ri (Marisa): OwO?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you're wntering something right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo the hall contest!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm entering on friday
N🆗ri (Marisa): which stinks because there's a panel at 6:30 i really want to go to but idk how long judging will take and then there's the photoshoot with biru
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooooo ok yea i mixed them up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): theres also something called a fahion show on friday
N🆗ri (Marisa): they have the awards ceremony at halftime of the masquerade and i wanted to see it but i know im not gonna win anything so i can watch it when the masquerade is uploaded online like three months later <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah! that's more visual kei/lolita stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): finninyan enters that sometimes and i know a few people who do it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oooo neato
N🆗ri (Marisa): i need to update my katsu schedule what google account did i upload that to
N🆗ri (Marisa): awww hahaha i found an old spreadsheet from 2015 called "stuff i have to do in japan" and the only thing written in it is "zoo"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lmao
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): did u go to the zoo?
N🆗ri (Marisa): found my 2016 katsu schedule
yeah!!! i went once in 2016 and then last year i had an annual passport so i could go anytime i wanted because it was really close! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no my 2016 katsu schedule has a photoshoot that i never went to
but it's also a super incomplete schedule so i think it was cancelled?? i didn't miss a shoot did i???? i wouldn't of missed a shoot if i had already paid for it and i usually pay ahead of time oh no now im paranoid
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was 3 yrs ago no senso worrying now, did u find your shedule for this year?
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah im on the fourth account i have a good feeling about this one
N🆗ri (Marisa): *im gonna worry*
N🆗ri (Marisa): that was a bad katsu i had a lot of issues that year
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats no good!
N🆗ri (Marisa): found iiiit
yeah i got scammed by one photographer who i went out of my way and left my friends to meet with, never got pictures from another, got absolutely awful pictures from another, got replaced in a group photoshoot without advance warning, and my partner wasn't able to get into the formal dance
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NOOO 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): due to the dumb scammy photographer i didn't get to eat dinner and had to wait in the reg line for 3.5 hours alone and i was out $60
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WTFFFF
N🆗ri (Marisa): when's the rwby pajama party?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 9:30 friday i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): wew
N🆗ri (Marisa): thanks
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow this is pretty cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): $60 for 15 minutes and 2 pictures. cosplay photography pricing getting insane.
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru what time was for corn again? noon or 1?
N🆗ri (Marisa): katsu stopped uploading their masquerades online <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Noon.
Bill: I think.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 👍
Bill: Nope 1pm
N🆗ri (Marisa): o ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it possible to move it up any
i know you're booked solid tho
Bill: By a half hour maybe?
N🆗ri (Marisa): that would be perf if possible
N🆗ri (Marisa): no pressure
Bill: this for masquerade?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i want to see it but it's stupidly early, and i also wanted to get emma pics at some point so i was trying to see if i could..........
u know what
maybe i could get emma pics after the masquerade? 🤔 it would be dark but that's better than changing all your plans around
sorry i'll try that then. but i would have to leave at around 1:30 regardless of photoshoot time
Bill: what?
Bill: You've completely lost me.
Bill: Are you still doing Corn or replacing with Emma?
N🆗ri (Marisa): im doing corn!
N🆗ri (Marisa): corn is in the morning
N🆗ri (Marisa): corn is also stuffy and hot and possibly hard to sit in though so before the masquerade i was gonna change, and masq is at 2
N🆗ri (Marisa): so corn is from wake up to 1:30, 1:30 change into emma 2:00 masquerade
then i'll find someone after the masquerade to get emma shots
N🆗ri (Marisa): if that's possible. that's good with the current schedule right? because 1:00 photoshoot?
Bill: Hold on a bit. Let me pick this up after lunch.
Bill: Too much going on at work.
N🆗ri (Marisa): have fun
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): can someone shoot swimsuit 2B for me sunday night? i talked about it briefly at some point? even if its just like a phone with potrait mode or something?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~you can even use my phone~~
Bill: probs? S'long as we can be chill about it.
Bill: Low stress sunday.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh yea def
Bill: Ye I have no *plan* for sunday, beyond shoot MM and shoot Persona.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): coo
Bill: maybe nightclub.
Bill: Hang out with Leanna's friends ~~so they can fill room spots for us if we Magfest~~.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): idk what to do mid day sunday, maybe just put something back on for gazebo pics
Bill: Possibly renora boudoir, if we don't get to it thursday.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tom is gonna be in asriel thou
Bill: Later in the day. Maybe.
Bill: goal is still Thurday.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye ye, im just trying to fill that mid day slot 🤔
Bill: hmmu.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): looking at marisa shedule i look like  noob
Bill: Marisa is *insane*.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pool party!!
No no u cool
Are we still doing deltarune or is that getting pushed back
I haven’t started ralsei yet but the costume should be simple
Bill: Tom is doing it?
Bill: Also ye, that can probably photo. If not me one of our squad.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea <@!351785752197201920>  has like a csual asriel
N🆗ri (Marisa): Would he be furious if I can’t finish ralsei and rain check for another con
I was planning on making him next week but I have to see how my hand heals. It’s in a bowl of water right now and I can’t bend my index finger too well
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he knows you already cronching hard
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~then you’ll have time to play and cosplay kris!!~~
I do have toriel I could bring
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sunday pool party
N🆗ri (Marisa): I bring GoPro maybe we get some underwater footage
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): theres a panel on that
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah we can just raincheck 👌
Dirty Lego (Tom): I figured you might not get it done and it didn't take me long to put together
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank u sorry for 50% failing u
There’s a chance I could still do it but I don’t have a lot of experience with burns and I dunno what shape my hand will be in
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’d only take part of a day to make, the hat is the hardest part
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): how bad is it mawisa? did u ice it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah we don’t have ice but my hand is in some cold water
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): u has neosporn?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have cream to put on it but when I take it out of the water it is pain. And I have a high pain threshold
Yeee
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): okey dokey ❤
N🆗ri (Marisa): There aren’t any blisters but I can’t bend my index finger all the way or my thumb 🖐
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m not used to big burns I dunno what to expect to happen 🙀
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if it bad enough it will blister later
Bill: I could squeeze corn in between 11:30 and Noon Marisa. Otherwise I finish Mipha for Audrey at 12:30.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That would work. I should be finished with Georgia by that time. Many arigatous and appreciations.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Either 11:30, 12:30, or 1 is good
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can’t wait to see mipha that looked awesome
Bill: 12:30 then.
Bill: You can meet up as I finish up with her.
Bill: ~~Also I'd like friend with in case Mark doesn't come along cause being alone with Audrey would be weiiiird~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee I can stay for that!! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: well, she's noon to 12:30.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee I can stay early for that!! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): The opposite version of stay where it happens beforehand
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~packs up Zelda~~
Bill: ... <.<
Bill: You could I bet.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m already bringing Zelda’s wig because she has the same braided hairstyle as Sonia
Bill: Do you have any other fire emblem shoots going on?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nop
Bill: ... You want to save Corrin for Zenkai to do with Andoru and do Zelda with Audrey? I'll ask if she'd be good with it.
Bill: ~~then once you've met you can do touhou together at Zenkai~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🤔 
If she says it’s okay then sure
I also have to check if meg if doing fire emblem but I think she’s doing taz
TOUHOU
Just remember fire emblems at zenkai would have to be at night
Bill: Eh I bought the speedlight. We'll do whatever we gotta do.
Bill: Or I'll come visit for a day.
Bill: I'm due to.
Bill: ~~you need to get used to driving again so you can come spend weekends with us Mawisa~~
Bill: Check with Meg first.
Bill: And if you really want Corrin I'm still 100 on board for that too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m checking my closet for boots because I had to toss my Zelda boots, wouldn’t fit in the suitcase back from Japan
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wow my hand hurts
N🆗ri (Marisa): I dunno if I have room for both zeld and corn because they’re both bulky
Bill: I mean if you don't want to do Zelda you don't have to cause I suggested it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd like to. i think it'd be fun. im just trying to figure out if i can, because i don't have boots at the moment and also my hand feels like it's on fire so it's a little distracting
N🆗ri (Marisa): corn was chosen because it's a warm costume and the con is usually cold outside
Bill: I will happily provide hot chocolate post shooting outside. 👌
Bill: So check with Meg first.
Bill: Then I'll ask Audrey.
Bill: and I suppose check for boots.
Bill: So let me know at some point.
Bill: ~~why am I shooting with new people when I have so many cosplays my friends are doing to shoot~~
Bill: I have to decide what to do about the formal... I was talking about skipping it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't even figure out if she's actually going to katsucon now that i look at her sites
WHAT
WHY U SKIP
Bill: I get bitter at the formals cause I want to dance with a girlfriend.
Bill: ~~gotta buy that Daki~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): dont they have those bracelet systems
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah get a formal daki
Bill: Those bracelets don't work for peeps like me.
Bill: I'm not decided on it for sure, but I thought I'd photograph people before they headed in, then find the rave or club? Not sure.
N🆗ri (Marisa): rave starts at 11 i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): we'll be your wingsquad
N🆗ri (Marisa): i figured the ball would be one of the few times everyone was actually together
Bill: If you mean BNE, that and the PJ party.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and aurii too
Bill: Aurii will end up together pretty often.
N🆗ri (Marisa): orly?
Bill: Traditionally we don't stay too far apart at cons. Tom and Jess float about, Georgia and I usually have a schedule to keep in the day time but at night we're wherever friends are.
Bill: Dave will be attached to someone.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll be all over the place <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: You fall in the me and Georgia category.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye but i usually have a night schedule too
Bill: 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): is anyone interested in going to con stories after dark
N🆗ri (Marisa): 12:15am - 1:15am
but if the room is quiet and thats sleep time ill skip
Bill: No skip needed.
Bill: Maybe? If I'm alive around then.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's friday night so u'd be fine probably
"on my way to S rank your man" sounds really funny too but im not interested in going
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'll go of I'm not ded
Bill: I just don’t want to pack dress clothes, Ngl.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wear dress
N🆗ri (Marisa): ^
Bill: ~~Theres a tag for that it’s called ugly bastard~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You don't have to wear a suit jacket just bring dress shoes slacks and a button down
Bill: Lol the suit jacket is the fun part tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): suit jacket over dress
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Tom's gonna be on dress cloths from Saturday afternoon till Sunday afternoon
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yo that Ray jacket is lit
Dirty Lego (Tom): Or is it saeran
Dirty Lego (Tom): Eh it's all the same anyways <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yours? Saeran technically?
N🆗ri (Marisa): "are you ray or saeran?" "yes"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm glad you like it tho
Dirty Lego (Tom): The chain so fancy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ✨
Bill: Dress clothes are nice they just suck to pack.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Just iron then when you get there
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oo the Velcro came in
Dirty Lego (Tom): Woo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Whoo!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Babe are you gonna be ok I. Your dress shoes that long?
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): bring them in a dress bag that's what i'll do for katarina
Bill: oh right *dress shoes*.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Are you sure? Do t they usually hurt you after awhile?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean the rest of us gotta being like 19 pairs of his so no sympathy from us
Bill: Meanwhile I have piles of camera equipment including *light setups*...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have a wedding dress
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's gonna be fun to pack
Bill: no doubt.
Bill: I'll probably pack the suit anyway... I mean, then I can decide in the moment.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I should bring it the right way but man I just wanna fold it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I can pack a few things in the dress bag to make it more worth it
Bill: You need somewhere to hang the dress bag.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea?
Bill: Four people in my car coming home.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Or lay it down
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Dave is taking stuff we dony need home
Bill: oh true...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Plus it can be layed down also
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So it fine
N🆗ri (Marisa): i only need my dress bag on the way down, i'll be putting the costume in the suitcase for the way up. you can hang your dress on me.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I might just end up folding it anyway it seems pretty wrinkle resistant
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dress shoe ideas 
https://i.redd.it/fk2qqsg68ne21.jpg
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Plz don't
N🆗ri (Marisa): fashion
N🆗ri (Marisa): Perfect for tom’s saeran
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I do not think so
N🆗ri (Marisa): Biru I bet they’ll match your suit
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> what plan for Zeikani at 2? She mentioned having a 2B maybe and I’ll point out she forgot you if you want to do it still.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Just do the shots without me first of I'm kate
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hmmm I will have to redo my makeup thou so I better change out earlier than tht
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Damn maybe I should get up earlier
N🆗ri (Marisa): lets do it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): When u get up Marisa?
N🆗ri (Marisa): whenever everyone else get up but i like to be up and out early at cons
N🆗ri (Marisa): my flickr's gonna start deleting pictures today how much do i care about old katsu photos
N🆗ri (Marisa): found a picture of a 2b i took 2 years ago
Bill: Sure? You can spend more time in San, do the photos with Justin rather than Zeikani.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's not worth it for a half hour difference plus u want Adam too right?
Bill: If Tom wants to. Judging by Kotori and Katsu being her first con with her new girlfriend (chalk up another one for the gay column) Zeikani going to be a all over the place. Very hyper. That can be a bit distracting but she knows how to pose so she just is hyper in photographic ways. I lost track where I was going with this.
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone give me a picture to edit i wanna test something
N🆗ri (Marisa): imma steal one off biru's site
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IT OK I'll be the toobs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): She wants a toobs right?
Bill: Definitely.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Then ya!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Tom says he's iffy on boudoir and it'll depend on his mood
Bill: Are you going to do it regardless?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Uhhh idk probably? I still have to pick an outfit 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you gonna upload the boudoir stuff to your website and flickr publicly?
Bill: Not to my website, to a private Flickr album. It’ll only be visible to people with the link.
N🆗ri (Marisa): good idea thank
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): why is sewing tiring
Bill: I’d considering creating a boudoir page of the website if you guys didn’t care about them being uploaded but I don’t think that the case.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it would depend on the pictures imo. some i'd be ok with because they'd obviously get posted to insta/twitter but others i would bury in shame eternally
Bill: Isn’t wedding Maki closer to clothing than lingerie?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea me too
Bill: ~~tbh I assumed you weren’t going for lewd and more for photos in the hotel room~~
Bill: That’ll be a long future problem.
Bill: If at all. Not like I need a portfolio.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'll prob do it, im just not feeling it right at this exact moment
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wasn't sure because it kept being referred to as boudoir. i have a swimsuit for maki i could bring but ye regular pics in a hotel room would be nice. it's a weird outfit.
Bill: you were the first to call it that silly!
Bill: ~~May have inspired Jess in the first place~~
Bill: Obviously you don't have to be lewd, you do what you're feeling like and that's all we need.
Bill: ~~swimsuit on bed?~~
Bill: ~~cce?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have very little awareness of what is lewd and don't care what i do but i will cringe at myself afterwards <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i go to cce i'd bring rin's swimsuit it's a police uniform
Dirty Lego (Tom): That sounds fantastic
N🆗ri (Marisa): i started editing this pic of you guys but i forgot what i was testing and every time i tab back i forget what i'm doing so it's just becoming a thing
Bill: to both Tom and you, boudoir is a 'personal' style of photography. It's something if you're really uncomfortable doing you're not going to enjoy it. You gotta decide what you want out of it. ~~Patreon followers~~, body positivity, showing off an outfit, love for your wife (Or waifu, for Mawisa :3), etc. I can tell you what to do to some extent, but you have to find your motivation yourslef.
Bill: I'd say "to Jess" but Jess *know* what she want.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah thanks
N🆗ri (Marisa): i would do it to show off an outfit (which is the main reason for maki. i've had that outfit for years. cursed.) and body positivity because i hate myself <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: and for the record this 'sagely advice' is coming from me reading a bunch of shit online, no personal experience what so ever SOOOO take it with a grain of salt.
Bill: Much like many of the things I give advice on.
Bill: body positivity meaning you want to show off what you're proud of.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo nvm aint got none of that
Bill: Also tips I found to do before shooting, by the models themselves <@!351471675843411978> <@!301927856240459777> <@!351785752197201920> 

* Don't wear anything tight; it can leave marks on the body
* Don't tan lol
* Remember any accessories, necklaces/braclets/socks
* Know what your favorite features of yourself are, the opposite, and your assets <:lenny:395307171539189760>.
Bill: it this Marisa?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye! that's it
Bill: that's not that bad at all.
N🆗ri (Marisa): mine's a little different but same version
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk what i was testing but i guess it worked
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's amazing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Not wearing something tight gonna be hard I have work Thursday all my work pants are tight
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Him pink again
N🆗ri (Marisa): **him pink**
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My OG idea was just more a stripped down Nora maybe like short white shorts or maybe the pink skirt I used for my swimsuit, and her jacket and bra??
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Im gonna do the sock thing all the burlesque girls do 😂
Bill: Depends if you're doing the stripping each other thing, then you'd want a full if loose outfit... If you just want to look sexy you can embrace the 'it's a cosplay if I'm wearing the wig' bit and just wear whatever.
Bill: the what?
N🆗ri (Marisa): socks are key
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean I guess I gotta have a plan for both now if Tom changes his mind
N🆗ri (Marisa): is there a rwby character i have that could go with nora
Bill: Neo, cause it'd be gay?
N🆗ri (Marisa): rarepairs
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo
Bill: but again, that'll get lewd.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean I could still do the bra and jacket thing either way the bra I typically wear with Nora is NOT sexy so
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): And the skirt and shorts is 3 layers so idk how that would translate 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): lewd isn't about how much clothing you have on
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have like in actual photo idea
Bill: What kind of mood are you aiming for?
Bill: Like, sexy sexy? ~~would sell on patreon sexy?~~ I’m confident and I know it? My husband is my true love?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): More like romanic sexy of he's with me
N🆗ri (Marisa): i could bring my pyrrha stuff but i would make the worst pillow lol
bring his ren stuff anyway and put it on a pillow
Bill: Pillow what?
N🆗ri (Marisa): got ahead of my thoughts
N🆗ri (Marisa): pillow ren
N🆗ri (Marisa): a regular pillow with his jacket or somethin
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: When you say romantic sexy I think of touch and intimacy. Close. Ample use of hands under clothes, fingers in hair.
Bill: Skirt is good for that.
Bill: Jacket with no shirt similarly. Tho, as a ~~loser~~ objective photographer I’d question why she has a jacket and no shirt.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Maybe she took her shirt off and then got cold
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So he put the jacket back on
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  do you think one of these works for MC?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Plz ignore hair ass legs
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo the right ones are really cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): where the hair
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It there
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Do you think they go with white too? Maybe I could get away with one pair of shoes for formal and MC
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!! they're a good color so they should go with almost anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): who are you doing to the formal? nora?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Whooo! Thanks Georgias mom
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 2B!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): In my wedding dress
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooo! ye they would work
WOAH goin' super fancy
N🆗ri (Marisa): you'll be the belle of the ball
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ill probably bring both of these in case my feet can't do the heels
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I might do flats to the formal honestly
N🆗ri (Marisa): so shocking
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz I'll be in my painful 2B boots right before that
N🆗ri (Marisa): everyone in my family assumes im bad with heels and then I tell them what i've suffered for cosplay
keep suffering youll be pro in no time
N🆗ri (Marisa): staff a con in stilettos that's an easy way
N🆗ri (Marisa): U can’t wait for the elevator when you’re in a hurry to get to the 8th floor <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ahhhhh
Bill: Maybe. Ye tho. Heck, you could use her normal outfit, it fairly flowy. It Ren whose outfit makes no sense for de intimates.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I just got the waistcoat I ordered online for ray. Men’s extra small and it’s still giant, who makes clothing this big. 
It’ll take 5 minutes to shrink it but why is it so big to begin with.
