Bill: Bigger size seems to be a better look.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What did you do with the smaller one 👀
Bill: Still have it.
Bill: Why?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~If you don't want it, can I buy it off you?~~
Bill: Lemme compare again to be sure.
Bill: I was going to pack and or costest tonight but I’m so mentally out of it and just kinda. Sad.
Bill: Just wanna go to bed. But also don’t.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bless her
Bill: Also going to upgrade my external for photos to the 4tb I had sitting around on my desk (used to be the anime storage drive).
Bill: Which leaves me with a 2tb paperweight.

Aldus Larian (Jess): Belt and broach done for Raven 🙌
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm sooo tired
N🆗ri (Marisa): kuro usagi would be a better fit for this year but i don't feel like digging around for all the pieces of her so i'm stickin' with my fox maid.
N🆗ri (Marisa): You did it!!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🎉
N🆗ri (Marisa): now test out your magic powers
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't believe i mixed up the theme aetsdjyrtearw how did i mess up so badly

Aldus Larian (Jess): Yessss
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bill! do you think youll have any spare time to snap a couple photos of ozma (not like a full shoot or anything unless you're up for it)
Bill: Ye. Whole point of no schedule to not be restricted from doing quality meme content.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEEEEEEE BLESS
Bill: ~~except I realize cause of shoots *for* me I have a form of schedule.~~
Bill: Oops.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): could you also maybe get a few shots of Tai with new wig? 👀 I'm doing him first part of Friday
Bill: Ye Friday is chill.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YO BTW i never actually said but your new wig looks fucking phenomenal
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): those cowlicks are on point too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm really excited with this new wig. I'm really starting to be even happier with how my Tai is evolving
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): THANK YOU 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I used the Leanna method again
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it works great!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just love how layered and wavy the little whisps are. They really make a difference
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and the bangs aren't as long and in my eyes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the color is so good tooo
Bill: HAHAHA my calendar entry for mm boudoir is in my work calendar oops
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like everything about it is 👌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my one complaint about the wig is that some areas seem a little thin in spots, and some of the wefts near the roots have that weird wavy crimped texture going on. Not sure the best way of describing it
Bill: Also <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> we have 4 to maybe 4:30ish with flora for big three. Georgia switching to todo at that point, so meet up with her and Justin, wander, go to their 5:30 to 6 shoot with Rebecca, have them ~~or Rebecca~~ snap photos after 6 with my ~~or Rebecca’s~~ camera?
Bill: and ditto for shots of you <@!245270932602486784> ~~cause I'm not a fan of having not shot a cosplay of yours~~.
Aldus Larian (Jess): shoot for 4 will be good just remind me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Take a picture of Justin and me taking a picture of you three
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): A R T
Bill: sounds like a plan then?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye
Aldus Larian (Jess): this is saturday ye?
Bill: ye.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that should work
Bill: Friday I have literally nothing planned between titans in the morning and lewd in the evening.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Art
Aldus Larian (Jess): do we have a set time for mm?
Bill: Nope?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok good
Bill: We don't technically have anyone shooting it lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean lewd mm sorry
Bill: basically during the formal?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I could possibly shoot it on my break but I need a time
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye, formal starts at what 8? so prob around there sometime
Bill: So long as it after we unload the rooms, whatever time is best for you I'd think Mawisa.
Bill: 8 ye.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m scheduled until 6 so if I request a break whenever they might make it 3 or 4
Bill: Something like 1 or 2 then maybe?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oki i see if i can do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): registration staff havent even finished their schedules yet and the con is tomorrow. what is this.
Bill: a mess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think our new chairwoman is definitely a little more lax than the last one, or whoever's in charge of staff services because this is ridiculous
Bill: new woman is new this year or last year?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't even know man i was away last year and keep getting this year and last year mixed up
N🆗ri (Marisa): it wasn't this bad last year though, i've heard
Bill: It sounds terrible.
Bill: ~~can't wait for next when you are a staffer and get to hang out all day~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): we got some local sandwich shop to sponsor our staff suite which is nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok i'll staff again next year just for you
Bill: ARENT
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's not what it says <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's next after kogara and cpac. next?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ahaha i see what i did there. funny.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll get my badges for next and otakon at zenkai because they have those convention discounts
N🆗ri (Marisa): what else do i need
Bill: Oh. Thoughts, I got jeans and UA gym hoodie for casual Mirio, but what shirt. A collared shirt or some T shirt?
Bill: I keep seeing fanart with him in a collared shirt but I dunno if that clashes with gym hoodie.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): are you planning on wearing hoodie open or zipped up?
N🆗ri (Marisa): they use wifebeaters under the gym hoodie but wear collared shirts for the uniform
Bill: zipped.
Bill: ~~I can't wear a wifebeater or I'll *look* like a wifebeater~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They’re called tank tops when you want them to sound less bad lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like you won't even see whatever shirt you're wearing regardless so you could probably just wear whatever 🤷
N🆗ri (Marisa): i couldn't remember that thank u oops
N🆗ri (Marisa): wear a dress
Bill: I only have the wifebeater style and not worth buying.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They're also called a-shirts
Bill: You'd just see the collar of the shirt if has one.
N🆗ri (Marisa): black wifebeater/tank top
Aldus Larian (Jess): i only see white ribbed tanks as wifebeaters
N🆗ri (Marisa): although looking at the manga pictures he might not wear anything under his hoodie
N🆗ri (Marisa): intense sobbing
Bill: I will wear something cause while it's not a great illusion, the tighter clothes make fat look like "muscle in loose clothing". We don't need to Doxx Mirio as a fake.
N🆗ri (Marisa): a corset
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THIS THREAD
https://dopeluminarydreamer.tumblr.com/post/183586624400/thotsma-is-happening-walk-into-salems-domain-like
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): IM FUCKING SOBBING
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): :JOY::JOY::JOY::JOY:
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG XD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LEANNA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg
Tikur (Kurtis): THATS AMAZING
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i cant stop laughing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this tag tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): pffft
N🆗ri (Marisa): I messed up the bottom but now I can cosplay Emma at least 8 times. I don’t think I’ve ever done the same character that many times but the option is open.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and i have another tattoo sheet if i ever have to bring neon back
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I always try to fit as many as I possibly can lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): on the tattoo paper? yeah me too but i've never used this kind (it had a separate adhesive paper?) and my printer sucks so i wanted to make sure to minimize anything going wrong
also there's a clothes rack in front of the printer now and my hair got stuck on SO many buttons while trying to grab the paper before it got folded ;u;
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh mine has that! the sticky sheet i mean
Bill: Ye!
N🆗ri (Marisa): why it have that
N🆗ri (Marisa): the kind i used to buy didn't
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk thats the only kind of had
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah mine has the adhesive. It's so you can stick it to your skin when applying
Bill: You should repeat cosplays more! They need more time to be appreciated.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Freaky <:woah:543194447345876998> 
But no one appreciates the costumes so I don’t wear them frequently
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is what I use
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea! me too
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah that’s it!!! That’s what I got! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> 
Flippin $8 for two sheets is absolutely insane though that’s why I put as much possible on the one paper
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea it spence
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've tried looking for cheaper alternatives but no luck
N🆗ri (Marisa): Could draw it or stencil it on but Georgia already did me that mega huge favor and I don’t want to bother people more
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I stenciled my Tai tat my first time. Traced it onto a shipping label, painstakingly cut it out with a dull x-acto knife, stuck it on my arm, and filled it in with sharpie 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): i knew tom wasnt gonna let me draw on him  so i went straight for tatoo paper
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That kid is me
N🆗ri (Marisa): [stabs sewing pin into heart] this is fine
Aldus Larian (Jess): plz do not
N🆗ri (Marisa): I gotta for the cosplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): nuuuu
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s a guy pushing a baby stroller in front of my house and rapping
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa when u doin Emma?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Probably Saturday
N🆗ri (Marisa): She was my most popular at Katsu so I figured I’d wear her Saturday
N🆗ri (Marisa): Friday will be maid Blake/cat maid
Aldus Larian (Jess): i can take pics whenever you have a break!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bless u what would you like in return
Aldus Larian (Jess): head gem!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok what else
Aldus Larian (Jess): friendship!
N🆗ri (Marisa): I dunno if I can do that well how about some spicy fruit roll ups
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ooh, so ChocoWaffo's fiance posted about a Nerf Gambol Shroud commission he started and it got me wanting to make one. Wouldn't be con-approved, but I was actually thinking last night I'd love to have a Gambol Shroud in gun mode
N🆗ri (Marisa): O if I cosplay Jaehee again would anyone be able to get an individual shot of me. I can pay in animal crackers.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OO ME PICK ME
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont need animal crakers tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok thank you I’ll give you extra credit on next week’s homework <:pwease:555585508819075112>

N🆗ri (Marisa): Or is there a time
N🆗ri (Marisa): I fear
N🆗ri (Marisa): Taking up space when people wanna sleep
Bill: Whenever we can Thursday night or Friday morning.
Bill: Silly fear.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): id rather do thursday...cause yang makeup is VERY differnent from Ozma
N🆗ri (Marisa): Friday morning it’d have to be really early though right? Because titans yeah Blake and Terra are blonde and black
N🆗ri (Marisa): Whereas I can do my Dani makeup as Blake
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but like if we can't find a time or we all tired AF or something on thursday, me and mawisa are sure to be around eachother again. so it's not a huge deal if we cant do it at zenkai
Bill: Well. Minimum I ain’t sleeping Thursday till everyone gets to con and Andrew won’t be in till midnight. So we should be fine with the Thursday night gig.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Are the other roomies ok with 11 though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but ye thursday would be our best bet
Bill: True but I gotta master the planning of these damn shoots.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye boi

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Gotta think of things to do until you guys get there
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~volunteer to stuff bags~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could visit Park City Mall. That'll kill like, half an hour
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I actually need to stop there anyway to look at eyebrow makeup for Tai at Sephora
Bill: why does Zenkai feel closer than it isssss

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): For smaller bits of cosplays I just started using gallon ziplock bags
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): to keep everything organized
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats what i use!
Aldus Larian (Jess): for accsessories
Bill: Aren't that many small parts, really. All my small parts are for the camera.
Bill: Jess, do you want me to pack an extra camera bag with the d3300 in it?
Bill: Or anyone, really?
Bill: Deal's you are in charge of it for the con tho.
Bill: I have enough camera gear to manage on my own.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye sure
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wait
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Can we park at the con center parking before we check in
Bill: yeah.
Bill: Should be able to.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Georgia what time you planning on getting down there?
N🆗ri (Marisa): you pay when you leave so don't forget to get the $8 parking card
Bill: kk. So... I'll have sd cards, though if you have one laying around you can just take the card with you after the weekend. I got a handful of lens types, 35mm prime, 18-55mm, 16-70mmish, 55-200mm...
Bill: Any requests?
Bill: I'll stick the 16-70 on it if not, it's a good generic lens.
Aldus Larian (Jess): LOL i dont know anything about lenses
Bill: ~~Thank you Ron for providing all these older, if nice, lens types~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): also i dont know if i have an SD card reader D:
Bill: That's fine then.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m prob gonna get there like 7
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll be there from like 1 or 2 but i don't wanna stuff bags
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t wanna be driving late so I’ll prob leave my house at like 4, and it’s a 2.5 hour drive
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's optional so find me partying in a corner somewhere
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): okie doke
Bill: ~~stop making me wish I had off thursday~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): feign illness
N🆗ri (Marisa): con fever
Bill: *I gotta wait for Tom and Jess tho.*
N🆗ri (Marisa): infect them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll probably get there between 6-7ish
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably closer to 6
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): depending on if I want to eat somewhere first
N🆗ri (Marisa): my first meeting isn't until 8 so i'll be loiterin' up a storm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Erik and I can explore the town and GET KIDNAPPED WOO
Bill: Hold on now.
Bill: ~~Kidnap Marisa first~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MAWISA you’re invited to get kidnapped too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEET!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm assuming no one's cosplaying Thursday? lol
Bill: bold of you to assume Marisa is ever not cosplaying.
Bill: ~~Btw your selfies for instagram were cute, speaking of not cosplaying~~ 👌
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /goes to Instagram to see if Bill is calling Erik or Marisa cute
Bill: Marisa, tho Erik is choice boi as well. 👌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😊
N🆗ri (Marisa): das me :0
who *isn't* cosplaying thursday is the important question
N🆗ri (Marisa): my selfie app is great it makes everything adorable if only it didn't consume 20% battery per second
N🆗ri (Marisa): i filled up the bobbin with super thick thread and it keeps getting stuck <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dang you know what
If anyone has any green fur/green fabric we can have a beast boy
Make a small animal or something
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Fleece?
N🆗ri (Marisa): anything really
N🆗ri (Marisa): if we had some green lint and seran wrap we could make a beast boy fly
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just dye a stuffed animal green
N🆗ri (Marisa): aww this was one of the contestants for the t-shirt contest and it didn't get any votes but i think it's really cute. i like it better than the winning designs.
N🆗ri (Marisa): with designs like that tho do you see why i thought youkai was still the theme <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo that's cute!
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's superstitions right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah! luck and superstitions
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo wants to leave at 8am tomorrow uuughhhgj
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa!
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's super early
Aldus Larian (Jess): She wanna PARTY
N🆗ri (Marisa): she wants to avoid rush hour but i think if we leave at that time we'll hit rush hour with everyone goin into philly
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I'd say like 10 would be better right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah! that's what i was suggesting which would put us at an ETA of 12
Aldus Larian (Jess): 8 is def Rush hout
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is another cute one with no votes at all omg
Aldus Larian (Jess): :o
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Who won?
N🆗ri (Marisa): why didn't anyone like these
N🆗ri (Marisa): the winner issss
Aldus Larian (Jess): They are all cute!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's our t-shirt design for this year, and the runner-up gets the button design which is...
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo whoa that's really pretty too wHOA I like the pin
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i don't like the winner too much but i like the runner up~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I kinda like the simplicity of the other ones
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee
i think the runner up really has the theme goin' strong
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like simpler designs for tshirts
N🆗ri (Marisa): that was our issue years ago. the shirts were way too complex and barely sold. then we had a shirt revolution when the theme was fairy tales and we sold out of everything on saturday
N🆗ri (Marisa): since then we've been going simpler
N🆗ri (Marisa): this was our first big hit
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like the runner up better
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was really close, 4-5 votes
N🆗ri (Marisa): was this the one for last year?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): last year's vote had an overwhelming majorit
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo that's neat
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh man the staff one is neat im gonna have to borrow bojo's
N🆗ri (Marisa): didn't you go last year? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea but I don't remember 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): OHhhh I like the staff one alot
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's super cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah das nice ouo
N🆗ri (Marisa): they didn't release the staff shirt design this year so i'm a little worry
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna know what it is that's why i started diggin'
Aldus Larian (Jess): RELEASE IT TO US
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know Terra’s bags are supposed to be on the front but they kind of look better on the side... <:minathink:544567715931750405>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Front (right) or side (left)
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know the T looks wonky sorry, the shirt feels really nice so I wanted to have the T removable so I could use it for other stuff ;u;
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no I looked up other cosplayers they’re all so good
Their bags are tannish oh no did I use the wrong colors. Some are tan and some are brown ok. Everyone made the bags smaller though too oh no should I take them in? I wanted to fit my phone and glasses but maybe I should make them smaller to be more accurate
N🆗ri (Marisa): But it’s such a cartoony style it’s hard to be accurate aaa
Bill: God DAMN you did that so quickly.
Bill: It looks great!
Bill: Meanwhile. Can I get agreement now that chub+tank top is mistake.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s it that’s Mario
Bill: It not.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just need wig
Aldus Larian (Jess): But you'll have the gym top over it?
Aldus Larian (Jess): MARISA your Terra looks so good
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess pls help it’s a wreck do I put the bags on the front or the side
Bill: Yeah. I’d rather wear a black t shirt that doesn’t have quite so much *shoulder* under if it’s not going to matter.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I already start side but I can tear it out
N🆗ri (Marisa): Shoulder shirt
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like they on the side
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bless <:pwease:555585508819075112>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Biru if you wear too long sleeves they’ll just rip when you flex because of your enormous biceps 💪
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I honestly think you'd be fine with a black t-shirt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also yes <@301927856240459777> your Terra looks amazing
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea black T-shirt good
N🆗ri (Marisa): Many thank. Just wait until you see it irl you’ll change your mind <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nope
N🆗ri (Marisa): What if meme t shirt
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg do you have any shirts with your own face on it
N🆗ri (Marisa): A must have for every wardrobe
Bill: Absolutely better.
Bill: My biceps are enourmous but not in the good way. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Did I ever say what I got for Pilot Boi at the Katsu PJ party? Since he was for last Katsu originally?
Bill: I got a shirt with "zero fucks given" on it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): GOOD
Bill: No pj party for zenkai tho so...
Bill: Not going to bring it. Still have it though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Corgi cosplay is having a PJ party and there’s an official Naruto one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): FUCK I keep forgetting Corgi Cosplay is going. I need to see if they'll be at their booth while I'm in Taiyang
Bill: It's a tad offensive for my taste, so unless there was a specific event meh.
Bill: Packing cubes per cosplay seems to be a success.
Bill: Gotta get em in a suitcase tho.
Glonk: nice terra 👍
