Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeee she good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ngl i never really bought amazon wigs cause i didnt trust them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): depending on how this todo wig comes tho, i might buy from amazon more <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): They can be a little thin but theyâ€™re nice and inexpensive <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): id like to git gud at wig stuff
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i remember styling hals wig last anext and it was actually really fun and easier than i thought
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho i dont really have any cosplans that require a complex wig
Bill: Do a new Yang wig like Leanna did.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like a franken-wig?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): by combining more and more together? oh boy
Bill: I dunno what she did but it sounds like it was a hell of an effort.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Longer the wig the harder to Frankenstein it because you gotta keep everything arranged ðŸ˜±
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): truuu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i meant something more short
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like storm lux

NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): That looks somewhat painted. Or the blue wefts are glued on rather than sewn together with the blonde
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the one on the right looks like a blue weft sewn in
Bill: Also a challenge.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Yeah itâ€™s hard to tell <:thinku:543194478614413318> It could be sewn in or it could be painted on
Bill: Do I wanna join the ghilies or not... Hmm...
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): **Initiation**
