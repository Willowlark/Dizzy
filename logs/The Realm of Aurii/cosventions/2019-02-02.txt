Bill: I'm looking at this... Waist measurement is for da pants, so while it's higher I wear pants below my gut so that's where I should measure.... right?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): uhhhh think?
Bill: well. According to the default size chart my measurements actually line up with the XXL...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Whatcha buyin
Bill: Haaazel. Looks like RWBY will be happening Zenkai.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Whoooo
Bill: Maaaaaybe Barry Burton from RE...? Which would be weird cause it would be the wrong outfit for the game I actually played with him, and RE1 is one of the few I've never played, but he a big guy and outfit pretty obvious RE ~~and I just want an excuse to get the random fancy key replicas and I'm not pretty enough to be Leon~~
Bill: Someone tell me not to pay 50 dollars for four fake keys.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Do not
Bill: Tank.
Bill: I don't need more useless thingys
Bill: Well. I still managed to drop 400 bucks.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ðŸ˜±
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): How many cosplays?
Bill: Barry Burton, Hazel, and a replica revolve for Barry. It's *such* an impulse buy.
Bill: There's no group for RE even, so like.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Neato! Both for zenkai?
Bill: I... guess?
Bill: ~~this was not a thought I had while doing it, but Fresh Young Rookie Leon basically just is Tom in a police uniform~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Na Tom's cuter
Bill: You're biased. ðŸ˜›
Bill: ~~Claire is waifu tho~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Na, Tom's cuter
Bill: I'm just saying the hair styles match.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~the second was to claire~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): **buy all the cosplay**
Bill: Panel apps are open for kogaracon.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): It shouldâ€™ve closed by now but theyâ€™re extending it, meaning they didnâ€™t get enough entries
Should I submit a trivia panel
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): If you want too!
Bill: Someone is doing a cardcaptor version of tracer and thatâ€™s... not even that weird.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I wanna use this for a cosplay someday but idk what to do with it
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Other than give it a neckpiece because it could use a collar or something
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Oh I also remembered some good con stories donâ€™t let me forget to share the tale of the time one of our staffers almost got murdered by an attendeeâ€™s father and the reason behind why Zenkai has a formal ball
Bill: Could be Pyrrha.
Dirty Lego (Tom): What was it before
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I have Pyrrha tho
Before it was in a trash bag on our porch and no one knows why
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Would these work as Neon pajamas? They seem too dark but I really love the feet they have little beans underneath
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): If only they were more colorful
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ~~do people ship neon and flynt. Neon in flyntâ€™s clothes as pajamas.~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): Skelyyyyyy
Dirty Lego (Tom): Is it you Skelly daddy
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I donâ€™t hold enough power to be granted that title
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): If that doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™m tryna find something long sleeved because I donâ€™t feel like doing neonâ€™s arm tattoo
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Iâ€™m just gonna wear a random dress and be Holo yolo
Bill: Thatâ€™d be a cute holo dress!
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i wasn't sure if the red one or a black one that has an inexplicibly high cut in the middle back that'd be good for a tail
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): **miku**
my savior
she has a bazillion random outfits
Dirty Lego (Tom): Wooo!
Dirty Lego (Tom): I think cuz of the cat ears it'd work
Dirty Lego (Tom): Looks like something she'd wear
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): that's prejudice against legos
