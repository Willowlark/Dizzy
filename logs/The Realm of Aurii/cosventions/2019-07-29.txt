Nokri (Marisa): Why are people in DC so WEIRD
Aldus Larian (Jess): What happen
Kaio Vermino (Lee): President lives there, causing mass hysteria
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Also weed is legal
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because DC is just a government conspiracy. They're all paid actors. Like in *The Truman Show*
Nokri (Marisa): We were trying to get food and one of the restaurant workers just stood there staring at us. He’d go do something and then come back and literally just stare. The manager came by and asked if we knew him and when we said no the manager ordered him into the back
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ew what
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Freaky people wow
Nokri (Marisa): When we went in he immediately started staring at us (this restaurant is pretty busy) and we asked him if he could take our order and he didn’t say anything or move he just *stared* until someone else took our order. *And kept coming back*
Andrew: lol
Andrew: DC is creepy
Nokri (Marisa): It is, a lot of people here are really scary
Nokri (Marisa): BoJo’s sandwich was entirely wrong and incredibly burnt so she’s returning it (we brought the food to our hotel room from the restaurant on the first floor) but she just wants her money back because what if the weird staring guy who’s now in the kitchen does something to it
Nokri (Marisa): We went in earlier for refreshments and the waitress and manager were absolutely fantastic but the kitchen forgot our order and other servers kept trying to give us stuff we didn’t order
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ahhhh what
Nokri (Marisa): Combined with all the people smoking marijuana on the streets and the creeps around the con, something is really wrong with this city
Nokri (Marisa): There’s such a huge homeless problem too. Truly, DC represents all of America
Kaio Vermino (Lee): 😬 😬 😬 😬 😬
Nokri (Marisa): STARING DUDE DOESNT EVEN WORK THERE
Kaio Vermino (Lee): WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
BoJo went down and they replaced her sandwich and as she was waiting the kid sat next to her *and stared again* and the barmaid came over and said “what are you still doing here? You heard him, get out!” 
He just stared at her until the owner came out and literally grabbed the dude’s arm and back and threw him outside
Nokri (Marisa): Acted like that happens all the time
Bill: New Kaminari pants are good. Late but good.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YOO WHAT
El🆓de Faun (Tom): DC IS WACK
Andrew: Yes to both
Aldus Larian (Jess): am ded
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same
Bill: Me too!
Aldus Larian (Jess): wack
Bill: *stops in NYC street*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I feel blehhhh
Still have that head dizzy feeling. Ashe and Dan both got sick
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo nuuuuu!
Bill: My ankle is like one mistep from breaking.
Bill: Hahaha apparently I’m worn out enough my watch thinks my walk from the ferry was a work out.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mark's cosplays were on point this weekend. He makes a REALLY good Stan Lee and bless him for sweating through Spider Noir
Bill: yeeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): he makes a great Colonel Sanders
