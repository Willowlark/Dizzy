N🆗ri (Marisa): You can gif with some websites but it puts a logo on the gif of a website
Better to download the video, save it as images through a video editor and then string it together in photoshop
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the gif app I use on my phone doesn't watermark it

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Not really any better...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe Marisa can make better gifs later
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can try to download you some gifs later but quality depends on where you wanna post em since some sites have size restrictions
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah is ok dont go crazy for us!
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh weird i thought the discoloration was from the gif losing quality but the whole video is like that?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I tried making it on giphy but... I don't want to upload it to giphy's database because that'd be weird
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but it could mean we could enter it via the giphy command here...
Aldus Larian (Jess): sometimes you just need a gif reaction of yourfriends making heart signs
N🆗ri (Marisa): do u want the colors changed
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😮
Aldus Larian (Jess): wut
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's so washed out
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea look at that
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont even know what to do with a gif of myself
N🆗ri (Marisa): frame it
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't really un-wash it out <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): do u like top or bottom
Aldus Larian (Jess): bottom? i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's cuz i saturated it. saturation always wins :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): tomu ur input
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Idk it's hard to tell, although I didn't have any issue with the original
N🆗ri (Marisa): i do both then
Aldus Larian (Jess): that sounds like work
N🆗ri (Marisa): no my work is whenever they call me and give me stuff to do
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean like alotta effort D:
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just sit at my computer like a weeb
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it ok if it's a little slow
slower motion
or should i erase some frames to make it faster
my software is really outdated
Aldus Larian (Jess): dont worry about it silly!
N🆗ri (Marisa): but the slow motion is either weird or aesthetic
Aldus Larian (Jess): if you just wanna send me the video clip thats be fine i think, i dont know what id do with a gif? cuz insta handles gifs as videos anyway right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): orly
N🆗ri (Marisa): k hold on i saved it as image files
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a gif its just too strong for discord
Aldus Larian (Jess): tank! ❤
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): your file names are always the best
N🆗ri (Marisa): thanks it took me hours to come up with "untitled" but i think it fits well y'know
it reflects the all-encompassing wonder of our universe that is forced a name by myself who is unable to store the file without bequeathing it a title as is law of the binary. simple yet profound.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotta gif this
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMFAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a lot of video from that weekend
i guess i should do something with it <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
i tried to but i think sony vegas kept glitching up
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): i haven't made an actual con video since like. 2015/2016. software just doesn't like these newfangled iphone video formats
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what are you using?
N🆗ri (Marisa): iphone 6 and sony vegas
when i entered a contest a few years ago vegas wasn't working and i had to switch to adobe premiere but even that was rough
Elfriede Faun (Tom): GOOD STUFF
N🆗ri (Marisa): ftghnj this girl posted a lewd cosplay and honestly it looks horrifying
Aldus Larian (Jess): D:
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ethan asks if we wanna go to a trampoline park tomorrow for 17 dollars
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that exactly how he phrased it because that's kind of funny
"do you guys want to go to a trampoline park tomorrow for 17 dollars"
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe he meant u pay him $17 on top of the trampoline fee
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Is it Get Air?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If so, then it's $16 for an hour, plus another $3 for the required socks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why don’t they just include the socks in the price...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Well anyways thoughts on that?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Does it close late?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): open till midnight on Fridays
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can bring your own super specialized trampoline socks and get a discount :3c
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): still requires buying socks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm kind of impartial. Like, I'll go if people want to
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea I mean I dont really care because no matter what we still spending time with Ethan
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t really feel like spending the extra money tbh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEAAAAA
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I wouldve played to see the band but this isnt a cheap af concert xD
