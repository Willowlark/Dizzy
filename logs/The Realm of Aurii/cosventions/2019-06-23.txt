Bill: > oh someone is asking about Chris being gone for a month how nice
> second time reading: that’s LTD. YiKeS
Nokri (Marisa): i haven't updated my cosplay facebook in over a year but i've gotten 20 new likes this week. no one tagged me in anything. what happened.
Bill: People are realizing how amazing you are.
Bill: It was bound to happen.
Nokri (Marisa): naw but like what happened
Bill: People are realizing how amazing you are.
Nokri (Marisa): This is weird
Nokri (Marisa): oh there were comiket pictures someone sent me that i never saw in my inbox
Nokri (Marisa): i'm scared ahhh it's probably really awkward mari ones
Nokri (Marisa): y u p
Nokri (Marisa): that's getting zipped up and thrown in the most isolated corner where it will never be opened again
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The bathing suit set that that guy posted on twitter?
Nokri (Marisa): ooo i forgot about that
same costume different photog
Nokri (Marisa): these ones look more like random hall shots
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ooohh 😭 
A-at least he got them back to you I guess <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): yee that's nice
i feel bad i didn't see them for a year
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If I recall right you got two sets back from different photags that were both pretty good
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Did you do like a ton of shoots
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Or I guess rather did alot of people stop to shoot you
Nokri (Marisa): japan's events are kind of the opposite of american ones
you can't really wander in cosplay, you're restricted to stay in specific areas blocked off by traffic cones, so cosplayers will get changed, go find an area, and then claim a spot where they sit most of the day. then photographers line up in front of a cosplayer they want pictures of. i had a decent line (~5 photogs) a few times
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ahhokay that's right
Nokri (Marisa): mostly because foreign, i think. i wouldn't have any lines until some brave soul came up to ask in their best english for a picture, and once someone did that then others would line up behind them because they didn't want to ask on their own
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You can cosplay and wander too tho right, you just won't get pictures?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Aww that's really cute
Nokri (Marisa): depends on a lot of stuff (what the costume is, what event it is, where it's held). in this case i wasn't allowed to wander, i had to stay either in the designated spot or travel back to the cosplay changing rooms
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn, was that because of the costume or the the convention had an area for cosplay and nowhere else was allowed
Nokri (Marisa): bit of both, i got kicked out of one area because it was a swimsuit cosplay and those can only be done in certain areas, but also you don't really see a lot of cosplayers roaming around indoors in the doujin halls during comiket
Nokri (Marisa): it's a bit more common to see roaming cosplayers at anime japan and nico nico choukaigi
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ahhh yee..
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's odd to me how lax Japan is with sexual humor and such but not in the public eye
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like, why do tanukis have huge balls 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *I was talking about this earlier it's not out of the blue j swear*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
They were at the place we went for dinner last week
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I read through a bunch of TANUKI lore looking for answers
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The only answer I found is, well because they just have huge balls, you know how it be
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): oo the tanuki thing is a bit different, it's from a bygone era
japan had very lax views on nudity and lewd things because they're natural, but that changed after the meiji restoration opened up the country to the rest of the world and the american occupation in wwii wherein they started adopting more christian values to nudity

so now you have two categories: modern views on lewd things as being sinful as bad, and traditional nudity from a time it was more accepted and not sexualized the way we see it today
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I also read something briefly about them using TANUKI scrotum skin
Nokri (Marisa): things are only bad if you see them that way
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Why is my phone capitalizing TANUKI
Nokri (Marisa): i thought you were just really excited about them
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeahh I suppose that makes sense
Aldus Larian (Jess): That makes sense
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But damn anime nudity still floods japan
Nokri (Marisa): like, mixed bathing was really popular a hundred years ago and some families still take baths together. like, fathers and their elementary/middle school aged daughters or mothers and their sons. that's totally acceptable there but a lot of westerners get appalled over it
Nokri (Marisa): also depends where you are. more lewdity accepted in rural areas because they're slower to develop and modernize compared to the cities
Nokri (Marisa): there's a reason most people in mixed baths nowadays are elderly
Nokri (Marisa): spoiler because irl nudity but here's what bathtime used to look like in japanese communities
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think the word "lewd" implies "forbidden" within itself tho
Nokri (Marisa): truu i'm just a coward who wants to avoid saying words that are considered "bad" by our society 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or like sinful, sexual
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn the coed too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That's surprising
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But cool
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Different cultures are cool
Nokri (Marisa): yee! nudity wasn't anything bad or shameful it was just a natural state so co-ed bathing was the norm
Nokri (Marisa): #takebackthelewd
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also omg so many people in one bath aghhhh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There is at least 60 too many butts in that water for me
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea nudity within itself is just natural it's the difference in culture, and leanlrned behaviors that make it "wrong"
Nokri (Marisa): the water's clean!! you wash before you get in!! you can see some of the showers in the top right corner where people sit and wash/rinse themselves off before going in the water, the water is more for relaxing. isn't it relaxing to chill with that many naked people
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OH TANK GOODNESS
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Alright that's not as bad
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Still too many butts but at least it's less gross
Aldus Larian (Jess): 60 people in a hot tub 0 feet apart because they don't attach nudity to sexual interaction
Nokri (Marisa): this bath fits 1000 people
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh does it now 🤔
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 5' x 10'
El🆓de Faun (Tom): "How man people do you think could fit in here Jerry?"
El🆓de Faun (Tom): "Idk use tent sizing JimBob"
Nokri (Marisa): jimbob-*san*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **Ooh I'm sorry my bad**
Nokri (Marisa): 大丈夫、大丈夫
Nokri (Marisa): [that thing where people wave their hand in front of their face while saying "気にしないで”」
El🆓de Faun (Tom): John Cena San?
Nokri (Marisa): doot doo doo doooot
El🆓de Faun (Tom): John Cena has been trying to tell us it's okay for years
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Thanks Cena San, I needed that
Nokri (Marisa): a girl i met at kotoricon just posted about how she'll miss all her middle school friends who are going to a different high school next year, and how great the last few years of middle school were
<:woah:543194447345876998>
Nokri (Marisa): me, seeing her at a future convention: [shakily raises finger to point at her] y-you're baby
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OMG
El🆓de Faun (Tom): she is Baby!
