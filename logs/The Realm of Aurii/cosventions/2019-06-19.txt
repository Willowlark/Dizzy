Kaio Vermino (Lee): cause im about to like OCD schedule out my day
Aldus Larian (Jess): I gotta see the schedule again
Bill: I gotta make friends with a zelda cosplayer. When shooting Jessie as Ruby I kinda realized I'm good at making characters look elegant.
Bill: Which was only partially good for Ruby but still a good thing to know.
Nokri (Marisa): Iâ€™m a Zelda cosplayer ðŸ‘€
Nokri (Marisa): ~~R.I.P.~~
Bill: You are!
Bill: I'm sorry I forgot!
Nokri (Marisa): Is ok Iâ€™m bad Zelda
Bill: If you rewear Zelda I could do that!
Bill: Your zelda is good hush.
Bill: I didn't think of it at first cause I was thinking of the more classic dress Zeldas rather than BOTW.
Bill: Unless you've done a dress zelda in that cause owo
Nokri (Marisa): Iâ€™ve done simpler ones for Halloween and also toon link
Bill: Def thinking Zelda for elegant since Link compulsively breaks pottery lol
Nokri (Marisa): I think I know another Zelda maybe. They might have sold it though they havenâ€™t done it in a long time
Bill: I sure we'll stumble on one eventually.
Nokri (Marisa): the photographer who took this was cool he gave us the photos from his camera by phone during the shoot
Nokri (Marisa): I look bad but the photographer guy was very neat and good at pictures
Bill: You do not look bad...
Bill: I remember the story, you were excited about it back then too.
Bill: I like your BOTW Zelda.
Bill: I'm going to need a longer post it note to keep track of my favorite Mawisa cosplays.
Nokri (Marisa): it was supposed to be the only costume I had while in japan. Hilarious.
Bill: lolol
Bill: How could you ever believe you wouldn't spawn cosplays by just existing.
Bill: fuck, Jen's roller derby thing is 5-8pm... I didn't want a late night.
Bill: Was hoping it'd be a nice, relaxing day time thing and I could drive home in sunlight for a change.
