Bill: PartyCos 3D Print Anime Game Hoodie Claude Von Regan Cosplay Costume Sweatshirt Zip Up Jacket https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WG6T6QZ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_tdlvDb8JA618D this could work if you don‚Äôt mind that.
Bill: (It‚Äôs dimitri not Claude)
Nokri (Marisa): oh wait for that one you have to specify which one you want to the seller. but just look up 'brown doll hair' and you'll find 500 other listings where you don't need to do that

Andrew: they have edel too lol
Bill: 5pcs/lot,15x100cm Straight Deep Brown Heat Resistant Hair Pieces for Handcraft Doll Wigs https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XRZCJNH/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_fflvDbMCT0A30 so that?

Bill: If I was talented I‚Äôd do Barbarossa with your great lord. There isn‚Äôt even a place to throw money at to get it either. üò≠
Andrew: Make it!
Bill: Do you. Realize how difficult that would be.
Bill: 
Andrew: Um...
Andrew: yes.
Andrew: yes I do.
Bill: ~~keep in mind making cosplay isn‚Äôt something I find interesting or fun, I just like doing it~~
Nokri (Marisa): gathering the materials hardest part
Andrew: ^
Bill: Speaking of. Mawisa could you use the other things of doll hair? Shipping on a single thing of it would probably be more than getting the 5 pack.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://arda-wigs.com/collections/classic-accessories/products/short-wefts-classic-cl-051-to-cl-100?variant=37109107916

Nokri (Marisa): Get a pink glitter one
Bill: Couldn‚Äôt find the words to search it tho.

Andrew: damn
Bill: Everything seems too wide on Amazon. Like the hair extension clip is for your whole head width.
Aldus Larian (Jess): a since you're looking for a natural hair they come in full sets
Bill: No wait the images are lying to me yeah what Jess said.
Bill: So 24 bucks and all I need is to braid it.
Nokri (Marisa): erik if you ever need wings to do dragon kirishima

Aldus Larian (Jess): when you cosplay but u dont feel good about it
Nokri (Marisa): oo ana is cosplaying female byleth

Nokri (Marisa): her most famous cosplay is probably her utena
Nokri (Marisa): she's also gudako 90% of the time
Bill: That. means nothing to be. üòÖ
Bill: I don't follow any Famoose people.
Bill: Unless I know them.
Nokri (Marisa): she's not famous
Bill: most famous tho.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah she had one cosplay that got relatively more attention than the rest of her cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): she was at the yona meetup at animenext in 2015 you were at
Nokri (Marisa): i figured you would be excited to hear that someone that somebody knows is being byleth
Bill: I mean, it's cool. I just wanna know *who*.
Nokri (Marisa): i never know 90% of the people you speak about on here <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *Then I suppose we are two different and unique people*
Bill: neeeeeee?
Nokri (Marisa): aaaa it sounds like you're fighting and being aggressive and i know you're not but i'm not sure what to do or how to respond without also coming off as aggressive
Nokri (Marisa): this anthy
https://twitter.com/tm_liza/status/1148226721063276547
Bill: Well you wanted to fight me yesterday. üòè

Nokri (Marisa): „Å≠„Éº„ÉºÔºü
Bill: it's a sound effect from. Some anime.
Bill: I wanna say CCS?
Bill: *Just embracing my inner waifu*
Nokri (Marisa): i think ccs is hauu
Nokri (Marisa): i guess i won't ask her to be our byleth then since you're not interested
Nokri (Marisa): OH it's hoeeeeee that's what sakura says
Bill: ~~maybe you could post her instagram or something...?~~
Bill: Also it's not like we have a group planned yet.
Aldus Larian (Jess): isnt that her twitter?
Bill: Though I did tell the people who replied to my story about being Claude it'd be Katsu most likely.
Bill: AH I didn't realize
Nokri (Marisa): you've been talking about wanting a byleth cosplayer since the game came out tho
Nokri (Marisa): oops she just followed me back on twitter haha *she's on to us aaaaa*
Nokri (Marisa): i can never contact her again
Bill: ~~I just think Jess would be a great Byleth and want her to know it~~
Bill: But, case in point, I'm pretty sure I've seen her before.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its my BDE
Bill: I'm guessing in Persona 3.
Nokri (Marisa): yona
Bill: Cosplay Mbyleth and I will 100% be your bromance for life. Is that a thing? Whatever not gay but kinda thing Claude's got goin on for Teach.
Bill: meeting.
Nokri (Marisa): claude is 500% bi
Bill: Except where's not cause Linhardt is the only bi guy. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Which is kinda unfair tbh since there's 5 bi girls.
Nokri (Marisa): before i knew anything about claude i knew he was bi by the sheer amount of memes and internet posts stating he was bi
Bill: now meeting
Nokri (Marisa): other guys can't marry him but it's obvious by the way he acts
Bill: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Bill: He's awesome, that's all that really matters.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: Also it's from the Fate stuff. Not that I do much Fate anymore but I've seen them in Gudako before.
Nokri (Marisa): yeee i said she was gudako 90% of the time
Bill: I didn't realize who Gudako was.
