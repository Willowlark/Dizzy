N🆗ri (Marisa): O I can’t really tell :0 the white one looks kinda like loungewear, the black one proooobably isn’t? Looks too ornate
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is the red an obi or the lining?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lining
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooooo
🤷 
Yukata aren’t usually lined so idk what it’d be sowwy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oo and yukata sleeves are usually not fully attached like how the sleeves on that white one are open on the bottom
Maybe it’s a fashion thing 
May u find answers <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And there's no bottoms with the black one
N🆗ri (Marisa): How long is it? Maybe it’s a happi? Sleeves look the right length
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like it goes down slightly past my butt? And the sleeves are slighty longer than elbows
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye that ain’t a yukata then, yukata would be at least ankle length
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Well I knew it wasn't that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But looking at happi that seems more likely
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sakura Sunday cosplay event signups are up if anyone is interested
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Idk if I'll be able to get there early enough for the cosplay thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah that’s the main thing. It’s weirdly early. Always has been.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Chihiro fabric got, as well as ray jacket fabric. I just took the rest of the bolt for ray since there were only a few yards. I think he charged me $8 for a total of 12 yards of fabric and some random appliqués.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pwease:555585508819075112> bless
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did u use the whole bolt? Like did any other customers even buy the fabric or did you just buy it all?
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i probably didn't use the whole bolt since i only got like 3 yards the first time around and it was mostly taken but i probably finished the rest of it~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): some of the bolts have been sitting there for years and then they get put on clearance so it's probably been there for a long while
N🆗ri (Marisa): the appliques were on sale for $0.25 apiece and some were super yellowed some from
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I polished off two bolts at Joann's and they add a discount if you do that. I was like neato
Aldus Larian (Jess): Appliques? 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg one of the students today had fabric with japanese on it they wanted translated and it was fabric about the story of Yoshiwara and i was like "I LIVED THERE. THAT PLACE ON THE FABRIC. MY HOUSE WAS ACROSS THE STREET."
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye!! it's like... stuff you sew onto other stuff! usually lace or stuff
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I thought u mean specificly for ray
N🆗ri (Marisa): like this!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo naw
N🆗ri (Marisa): ray gonna get fancy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Add lace
N🆗ri (Marisa): "mc will like me if i add more lace to my jacket"
N🆗ri (Marisa): he just becomes a mountain of frills
Aldus Larian (Jess): Gotta. Get. Even. More. Fancy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lace trim undies
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn $8 for 12 yards tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): What a steal
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is why i have so much cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): yoshiwara is the red light district i should go tell bojo the student is making a quilt for her mother decorated with famous japanese prostitutes
Aldus Larian (Jess): NICE
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did u find some fabric for Nora girl?
N🆗ri (Marisa): apparently quilt girl is gonna love it because she hates her mother in law, who the quilt is for
nah not yet 😭 we had her make a jacket today as practice for nora's jacket and we're gonna try and barter with her mother because nora's outfit is apparently too revealing for her christian grandmother
N🆗ri (Marisa): she has really cute braids though and she took them out at one point and they puffed up into an afro it was really cool
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz skirt? And boob window too prob
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe more the boob window
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i don't they noticed the heart cut-out they were focused on the short skirt. i told 'em she can make shorts to go with it and they were like "nah still too short" and in my heart i was like *let her be anime*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is not *that* short
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wear skin colored leggings underneath
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): I did that at konkon
N🆗ri (Marisa): smort
