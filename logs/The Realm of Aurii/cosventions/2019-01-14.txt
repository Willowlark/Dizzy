Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): there are more if you google Anime Los Angeles Fire
Bill: Which reminds me...
Bill: See me on Google Maps! https://maps.app.goo.gl/rwCd9JGGsD3mhwc83
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo now i can stalk u
Bill: Does it work?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye
Bill: Mind turning it on yourself so I can see from the user side? It's in the sidebar of google maps's app.
Bill: I've had the thought a few times to make use of this at cons. One, waaaaaay easier than trying to text locations back and forth, and two for safety reasons.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): See me on Google Maps! https://maps.app.goo.gl/qmjZj8ED1cGTY7YG3
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It shows me your battery
Bill: The setup in the app is pretty good, with everyone listed on the top. It's not exactly pin point though, so not going to find you in a building.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea so at cons its not really going to work for simply finding each other but could be good safety
Bill: Like you always have Tom pretty much, but Marisa is *a problem child* and will run off on her own... Georgia and I are busy Katsu so bar when we overlap during the day she may or may not be accompanied...
Bill: It's an idea.
Bill: I was going to turn it on while I was going down to the airport friday, actually. It wouldn't turn on while I was driving so I had to give up tho.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): most problem you're gonna have at a con are going to stay within the con center tho unless someone kidnaps you, still a good idea tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): where does it say i am on yours? like screenshot it close up
Bill: https://maps.app.goo.gl/?link=https://www.google.com/maps/@/data%3D!4m5!7m4!1m2!1s110002734088433227190!2sChZNakc2OVloT2lERllhTmN1MWgyY05BEggHBX9t7muVdw%253D%253D!2e2?hl%3Den&apn=com.google.android.apps.maps&amv=949000000&afl=https://www.google.com/maps/@/data%3D!4m5!7m4!1m2!1s110002734088433227190!2sChZNakc2OVloT2lERllhTmN1MWgyY05BEggHBX9t7muVdw%253D%253D!2e2?hl%3Den&isi=585027354&ibi=com.google.Maps&ius=comgooglemapsurl&ifl=https://www.google.com/maps/@/data%3D!4m5!7m4!1m2!1s110002734088433227190!2sChZNakc2OVloT2lERllhTmN1MWgyY05BEggHBX9t7muVdw%253D%253D!2e2?hl%3Den&ct=location-sharing-fdl&mt=8&pt=9008&cid=4865500345673352871&_osl=https://maps.app.goo.gl/qmjZj8ED1cGTY7YG3&_icp=1
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats actually really accurate for me
Bill: That‚Äôs more accurate than mine.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): are u on wifi or 4g?
Bill: Back when Pogo was a thing I did used to glitch a lot. Could be the building.
Bill: WiFi.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hmmm might be building then
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): mines like dead accuate
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Wow that‚Äôs spooky
Bill: We can play with it more.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if it is that accurate at a con then i think that would be really helpful
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Too bad Katsu WiFi sucks
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): guess ill die
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): We‚Äôll have to use smoke signals and berry trails the old fashioned ways
Bill: I'm going to get lunch, see if it gets more accurate
Bill: *stalk me owo*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Bill: Little shifted but I was there.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): did u get lunch at cvs?
Bill: Nah, I got snacc there.
Bill: ~~BNE needs to stop planning to go to RTX damnit~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): f that
Bill: It's an industry con for *one* industry with *one* (imo) good property, the guests are all from that industry, it's fucking far away... Look I'm as rwby obsessed as the next abnormally obsessed guy but it just not worth the cost. ~~Also all those crazy fucks from the southern community go there~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): too expense, too far
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): too little i care about
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i like rwby but not enough for that
Dirty Lego (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Exactly that. And the community aspect is pretty much gone because of the southern people.
Bill: I'll be too stressed trying to not get accused of domestic terrorism via gaslighting and perversion by a bitch with a jigglypuff hat to have any fun with my normal, northern friends.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if im gonna take a trip that far itll be to like florida or NC
Bill: ~~holmat`~
Bill: It's like konkon, but in florida with alcohol.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i cant do a con that close to Christmas
Bill: *ssssh just let the dream happen*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its not a dream tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): holmat seems neat but getting 2 people to Florida in the winter a week before the most financially taxing timee of the year? not gon happen
Bill: *Focus on the dream*
Bill: *swimsuits. Santa hats. Warm weather. alcohol. Friends.*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its not a dream of mine tho! XD
Bill: I'm not trying to convince you (I dunno if I really want to do that so close to christmas either) but boy it sounds better than Konkon.
