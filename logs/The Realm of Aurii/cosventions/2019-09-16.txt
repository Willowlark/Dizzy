Aldus Larian (Jess): I miss the kalahari's bathtubs already XD there was a spider in my shower this morning lol
Nokri (Marisa): omg the totoro cake pops are SO good. and bojo says the kalahari's cheesecakes are fantastic
Nokri (Marisa): the cake pops are actually full of cookie dough???
El🆓de Faun (Tom): No it's like an unbaked cake batter
El🆓de Faun (Tom): No egg
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Some of them are baked cake crumbled and mixed with frosting
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And then dipped
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I only got the chocolate ones, the vanilla we're good too?
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH! i only got the vanilla ones but they were so good i ate all of mine ~~even after half of it fell on the floor~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i did wash it off~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~it was still really good~~
Andrew: I wish I bought a cake pop now
Bill: ... huh
Bill: So I geeked out with a Lysithea cosplayer while I was running around as Claude. Took selfie, chatted, posted to story.
Bill: I’m going to *assume* she means as a photographer, not Claude.
Bill: That’s a new confusion point
Nokri (Marisa): you took a lot of selfies with girls <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *helpful anecdote*
Nokri (Marisa): ~~just insinuating you should take some selfies with guys also to balance it out~~
Bill: ~~guess what most of the fire emblem cosplayers are~~
Bill: ~~girls~~
Bill: ~~particularly the ones I happened to meet~~
Nokri (Marisa): what about the other claudes or the seteth? :0
Bill: ~~not a conscious decision~~
Bill: The Seteth walked away from me, the only Claude I saw was a woman sooOOOOO
Bill: 😒
Nokri (Marisa): i'm surprised you didn't get a selfie with them tho :0
Bill: I saw them in the waterpark when I didn't have my phone <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I took selfies with everyone I talked to. Thanks tho
Bill: I go out of my way to socialize and I do it wrong, apparently. GrEaT
Nokri (Marisa): NO NO i just wanted to make sure people didn't get the wrong idea
if you post a ton of pictures with just girls people are gonna get the wrong impression
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *checks all my selfies from the weekend*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh no...
Andrew: lol
Bill: it's like *women* cosplay more then men or something, *weird*.
Nokri (Marisa): wow erik can't believe you're a predator
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Anyway, back onto the original discussion point, I would say assume as photog, then if she says "no let's do a shoot together as Lysithea and Claude!" then you can be like "oh yeah! that would be a lot of fun! let's do that!" <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~is it me or were there more comments that got deleted~~
Bill: Can I go back to leaving when I'm pissed rather then sticking around cause leaving annoyed you lot  but I don't really want to be mean.
Nokri (Marisa): what happened?
Bill: No deletions.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you implied that he was coming off a certain way by only posting selfies with girls and then when I said something about most of my selfies being with girls, you said (jokingly I assume) "wow erik I can't believe you're a predator" which implies you thought Bill was coming off as predatory <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus Larian (Jess): it just something to be mindful of i guess? if a girl sees you only take pics with girls/of girls they *might* think that your only doing as a method to get pics with/of them i guess?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~I said "i guess" too many times~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^ which is a valid fear
Nokri (Marisa): i didn't delete anything
it was 100% jokingly yeah, i didn't mean it in such a way and i realize now it was pretty awful to say. I'm really sorry.
i was more concerned that, since bill is looking to make new friends and possibly meet a girlfriend, it sends a message that you're kind of a playboy or a creep that's only looking to meet girls. i didn't want to use the word creep though because i know that's a big fear that biru has and he isn't a creep, so i used 'predator' instead and that was a bad choice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and to be fair, the selfies I took were girls that I am already friends with so it's a little different ~~I was just kind of saying it jokingly~~
Nokri (Marisa): i was trying to offer advice that would make him seem more friendly and open to a wider group of people but i see i was being pretty awful
Bill: Oh hey I didn't even connect that one. So you got a pass there. I just don't have the ability to count my selfie ratio while I'm trying to get over social anxiety enough to hold a conversation with a stranger and that was a stressful time, so nitpicking that I should do it differently came off *really* unsupportive and having my friends supporting me is *really, really important* to me getting through all my shit. There wasn't even any ulterior motives to going around like that, I just wanted to share hype for fire emblem damnit. I need that to not be wrong

Of course, give me 15 minutes and I'll know it's not Marisa being unsupportive, it's just poor choice of words.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think you were being awful. i had the same thought tbh but i didnt know how to bring it up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I don't think it's fair to Bill that his initial post about a girl wanting to shoot with him (either as a photographer or as a cosplayer) turned into a discussion of him coming off a certain way <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Nokri (Marisa): yeah that's not fair to him at all, i shouldn't of said anything
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but the real question Bill.... was she cute? 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and she reached out to you about doing a shoot!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: Wasn't about cute. I was *literally* just trying to socialize with strangers. She seemed nice as a person.,
Bill: fdashjkl
Bill: I clarified, it was for a shoot of her. It is an absolute win, thanks for everything Erik. I'mma just... decompress cause I'm more upset than I wanna be but really don't want to be... upset, emotional anymore like this. Just stresses me out even more cause it's a bother
Nokri (Marisa): so about that mystic messenger panel idea... 👀
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:rapid:607237006539489310> <:rapid:607237006539489310> <:rapid:607237006539489310> <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Aldus Larian (Jess): *crashes through window*
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~shit thats a reference~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i wasnt even trying~~
Nokri (Marisa): good trivia info
Nokri (Marisa): haha 69. nice.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao what a troll
Aldus Larian (Jess): his blood type is AB
Aldus Larian (Jess): can we make people recite lines like the chrom panel?
Nokri (Marisa): YES
Nokri (Marisa): RECITE 707'S ENTIRE AFTER ENDING
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): All 3 hours
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): all night panel
Aldus Larian (Jess): we serve HBC and Dr. Pepper as snacks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo HBC would make a good prize though!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Do for zenkai!
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!!!
Nokri (Marisa): zenkai <:lenny:395307171539189760>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So you don't have to staff
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): i havent been to alot of panels would the jeopardy thing be the best way to do it?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also wanted to mention to yall, me and Jess talked a bit about it and we think we're gonna hard skip on Katsu this year
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I know it was discussed a bit already but wanted to mention that were pretty sure now
Bill: Oof
Nokri (Marisa): jeopardy would be cool!! or another quiz-style show, we should use whiteboards so both teams can answer
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye katsus cool but i dont feel like i get my money's worth
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA what other styles are there 😮
Nokri (Marisa): a regular quiz where we do each question one by one (without categories), ooor a Who Wants to be a Millionaire style quiz! oooor <:thinku:543194478614413318> other ones i'm sure!
Bill: Valid yes tho pricing for the rooms is going to rocket
Nokri (Marisa): get 2 others?
Aldus Larian (Jess): well we offically decided last night in order to give you time to fill our spots by february
Aldus Larian (Jess): do we wanna do teams or like individuals? prob teams
Nokri (Marisa): yee teams would be good because then everyone can play
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE cuz i feel like one person might dominate it lol
Nokri (Marisa): ~~lucina~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was talking to Haley at CCE and she said she might be able to go to Katsu again, and most of us have met her and like her so that could be one potential spot filled <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo that would be good!
Bill: Or, as we only had 8, we drop a room. We’d be at 6 with Georgia, Erik, Marisa, Andrew, Dave(?) and myself.
Nokri (Marisa): that sounds way cheaper than 2 rooms
Bill: It’s cheaper then 7, which is the shit number we got in last year, the absolute most expensive option (which is with Haley, and the list above)
Nokri (Marisa): how so? wouldn't 7 be cheaper than 6?
Bill: 7 is two rooms.
Nokri (Marisa): WHY
Bill: We don’t do more than 6 to a room.
Nokri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: 🙄
Bill: You know this.
Nokri (Marisa): we've fit 8 people in a katsu room before
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's illegal <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I. Will not. Put more than. 6 people. In a room.
Nokri (Marisa): sshHHhH
Nokri (Marisa): we'll probably have the one room then but if you go with two rooms i might switch to someone else
Bill: If Dave is staying with Ash and Dan or something we could have Haley at the 6th tho Erik.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): We'll just have to ask Dave, my bet sin that he's not gonna go either
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He unfortunately got a tooth ache at cce on his birthday and has to get the tooth pulled 😰
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So he's afk today and tomorrow
Bill: I fucking hate doing these bookings
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Then don't do em fam
Bill: That sucks. We won’t bother him with then.
Bill: ....
Nokri (Marisa): Are you okay?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sorry I thought 5 months in advance would be enough
Bill: You’re fine. It is.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think it’s just upsetting cause cons are fun and we want you there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But the $$$ is understandable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~hi it’s me back from the grave~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): GEORGIA! HI! we got you a ticket for hella mega if u didnt see
Bill: It’s a long fucking trip and I’ve considered dropping it myself for the cost involved.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jess have I professed my undying love to you lately
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Who do I owe the MUNS
Bill: Was poor timing to mention it consider I was so upset before.
Bill: That’s all.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah the most upsetting part is gonna be not getting to hang out with everybody but yeah lots of money
Aldus Larian (Jess): we're not sure yet i got 4 erik got 4 and bill got 3 so we'll figure it out
El🆓de Faun (Tom): We never do anything at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That means more fun at OTHER cons WOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea we just kinda walk around, and weave through people and go to the formal
Bill: Bookings have felt like a thankless job recently, considering the stress I put under to get them perfect for everyone is all. Hence the hate comment. It’s been pent up awhile.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How was CCE for everyone then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Drunken fun?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Someone else can take over bookings if it's that bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE cce was great! we missed you though!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I had a good time!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Awwww it okay I went hiking and night kayaking and to a soccer game!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I drop photatos in general
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Thank you for being the room booker <@!184437198865563648>
Bill: Thank you Erik.
Bill: That’s what I needed to hear. Bless.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yes. Thank You!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeee thank you Bill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And ofc we always gonna help fill rooms and whatever when you need us to
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oooo thank you bill! its super helpful that you do bookings
Bill: Erik with all the understanding me today, I might fall for you buddy 😉😂
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I dare you
Aldus Larian (Jess): but srsly bro. other people can do the bookings also.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My need to take on other people's burdens would say I could do it, but my lack of hotel booking experience would probably result in getting a bad deal resulting in higher costs or no room at all 😅
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Could split up the booking
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You do some we do some and stuff
Bill: It’s not the work, honestly. I like making sure everything is great, I’ve got the process ironed out. I guess it’s a mix of wanting to know it’s appreciated and I’m not being taken advantage of.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I actually think that's a good idea overall
Bill: TLDR it’s my personality issues that are the issue.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I actually *like* to take over CCE next year or even Zenkai
Bill: Why? Not to say you can’t do it or anything, but so I can understand you correctly
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why not? you just said it bothers you you have to do them all. It would be and tom sharing the responsibility over the room instead of just one person, and for CCE 2 people could charge to their band (me and tom since shared credit card) instead of just one so there would be one less person to figure the bill out with
Nokri (Marisa): I’m gonna submit a panel to kotoricon, anyone else interested?
Aldus Larian (Jess): is it the MM panel? <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Nokri (Marisa): If you want <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Aldus Larian (Jess): or you could do your history one again! that was neat
Nokri (Marisa): who likes history tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): do you have to tell them what the panel is right now?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i prob wouldntt wanna submit till we have something somewhat concrete for MM at least ~~cuz am nervous child~~
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah but apps close in October
Nokri (Marisa): So have until then to come up with a time
Nokri (Marisa): And what it is
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo ok thats a leetle bit of time then
Nokri (Marisa): ~~can I stand by the door and recruit people to join mint eye as they walk in~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): YES
Aldus Larian (Jess): Watch us make complete fools out of selves when a computer issue happens and neither of us us knows how to solve it
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): “we’re being hacked by our third, secret brother”
Bill: Sorry work thing answer in a bit Jess
Bill: Booking one room versus two isn’t toooo much different, honestly. It might make a lot of sense to have a different credit card on the other room next year at CCE, but splitting the booking itself isn’t going to change anything (it might make it more difficult to get connecting rooms actually). Plus I wouldn’t want to create a dodgeball scenario of who gets Tom and Jess <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> and who gets me 🙃 for people... Unless it’d be preferable to not have me in charge, which is why I wanted to ask why.
Nokri (Marisa): Tom and jess can stay in the same room tho
Nokri (Marisa): O wait nvm I misread
Aldus Larian (Jess): theres no connecting rooms anyway
Nokri (Marisa): Wait I’m still confused <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Andrew: >quick interject marisa I'd be interested< ok back to the hotel thing
Nokri (Marisa): Why would there be a dodgeball scenario of the rooms, were we in the awful offshoot room <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t think Tom and jess were saying to split the booking, they were saying they’d book
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea theres no point it splitting it that just seems like even more work
Bill: Aaaah. Zenkai already booked, CCE pricing is complicated but so fast paced as booking they don’t go quite as fast as others. Could do that. I’m doing anything wrong tho, you just want to help right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea? I mean I've wanted to try it for while but you always jump on it right away. if you really have that much problem not being in control then its fine.
Bill: No no, that’s okay. I didn’t even know you wanted to do it. It’s not about not being in control it’s about you wanting to do it for you, not cause I screwed up. (Insecurities)
Aldus Larian (Jess): like I understand you keeping the Marriott ones because of our points but CCE is a standalone
Bill: Hadn’t even thought of that. It’s not a deal breaker to lose points or anything, that’s making the most of what I was already doing
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Might wanna consider looking at other options for otakon next year too if there ends up being any price difference
Bill: Mm. Otakon is the most flexible con, cause so much is close by
Bill: Wasn’t sure if we were booking it tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): CCE dates are rumored to be Sept 18-20 next year btw
Bill: Awesome
Bill: If you wanna handle CCE I’m open to it. I just wanted to know if it was because I did something or anything like that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i thought you were looking for help idk
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It would be cool to make the final room decisions too just an an equaloty thing I thinkk
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea, you're always the one "in power" so to speakl
Bill: It’s habit for me to be take charge and make decisions so decisions do get made... and I can see how that could be bothersome. So you can run things if you want to and do it differently, and we’ll all get a new perspective on how to approach it
Bill: I have Zenkai already booked, but if you do want to take over for Otakon and CCE you can. I’m not going to fight you over it or anything 🙂
Bill: I just hope it hasn’t been bad this whole time and you’re just now saying it 😬😅
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nah that's not an issue
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I went to check pod (out of curiousity) since me and Jess talked about using that for our own get away but idk if it's too early or already booked up for ota but those dates are currently unavailable
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah probably as all of September is red too
Aldus Larian (Jess): Prob too early hun
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah that's what I figured but if we like it it's a cheaper option
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom and I are staying at the POD near otakon next month we well see how it is I think they may only have 2/4 people options
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Idk. How much cheaper, we'll see when it gets closer
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The place gen was staying
Bill: I think Gen was at an Airbnb.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nah it was pod I looked when we got there
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's no an issue of you doing it wrong. It's more like I get the impression you don't think anyone *can* do it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or do it right at least
Bill: I think you can! I didn’t think you wanted to!
Bill: My complaint earlier was just feeling under appreciated which is entirely my problem, I shouldn’t have said anything about it
Bill: Hotels at an earliest list rooms 50 weeks out. I’ve seen fluctuations in that though. Otakon books out all the rooms in the hotels they work with in advance, and those rooms all show up as booked from the hotel side. Otakon then resells them through a portal on their website which is easy to use, just a little vague on the details. that may be what happened with POD.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@351785752197201920> POD is small room, most rooms are for 2 people only that's why the deal was good for us
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I wanted to see if they had other types but I didn't really get to look
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye. It just smol rooms
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I also looked for 2 people but didn't get any results for availability for the reason Billy said I'm guessing
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye hotels don't ussualy have their rooms available this early
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Actuall henly park although old had sooo much room
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That was dope
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye but only 2 beds although 3 could def fit in that bed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): We did one room at ota right?  With two queens?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): My brain is fried
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:rapid:607237006539489310> Man henly would be good tho <:rapid:607237006539489310>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Why they gotta only have one bed per room
Bill: It was similarly priced iirc
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.instagram.com/p/B2fMgbKHf0_/?igshid=1e4xvxm8xoz3q
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How is it possible two humans can be so beautiful at the same time what the fuck
Bill: Yeah pretty much
Aldus Larian (Jess): Right?
Nokri (Marisa): A selfie filter! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): makes their eyes bigger, smooths their skin, whitens teeth. selfie filters are great
Nokri (Marisa): i just rewatched gone with the wind, i wonder how many people would recognize a cosplay from that
Bill: They’re actually that pretty though, not complimenting a filter.
