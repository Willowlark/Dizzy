Erik: Yoooo she's super neat
Bill: She's a Yang cosplayer from like, Ohio or something.
Erik: Colorado
Erik: Close
Bill: Steampunk flavor and that's legit as fuck.
Leanna: Oh shit shes the yang steampunk girl
Bill: Entirely the reason I follow her.
Erik: She's really cool. I talk to her sometimes
Erik: She wants to try to make it out to Katsu next year
Erik: I told her my cost effective Katsu strategy
Bill: She seems awesome. Yet another famous instagram person I'll know through ~~Georgia~~ others but I mean. Cool to see cosplay in person.
Erik: She just did a purge like we all did and went down to less than 700 followers lol
Bill: Oh really?
Erik: So not as super famous, but she still stands out because her steampunk Yang is fucking dope and not easy to forget
Bill: ~~You mean, you only want to shoot with attractive cosplayers for free?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wow rude
Erik: I told her if we're ever at a con together I want to do a steampunk Tai with her
Bill: DO IT
Bill: I'd shoot that.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh yeah I follow echogirl as well
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah her steam punk is sweet
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'm not a fan of echogirl after what she did to zen
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Caught you in my MM trap,no escape
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~he baited us~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): now we're trapped in this apartment with a bomb. it really was that easy. unknown'd.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also don't check in any of the cabinets
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Not allowed
Erik: If you just stay ~~in the cage~~ at Jumin's apartment, then you don't need to worry about the bomb
