Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea in can't think of any 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): These look more yellow yellow in the package tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Putting them in made more of a gold
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably just tint from your natural eye color

N👌kri (Marisa): otherwise if i teach that night i won't get there until like midnight
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Sounds like a dope time
Bill: You know. I’m guessing cons (bar colossal) aren’t big on shirtless people, in regards to fat Thor. I need a good meme shirt for that.

El🆓de Faun (Tom): What do you teach them?!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): anime and manga
N👌kri (Marisa): sewin' :sewing emoji:
N👌kri (Marisa): i just put the first coat of paint over this armor and it looks atrocious despite all i did to smooth it out aaaa
i'm gonna paper mache it in a last ditch effort once it's dry-ish
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybe it's just the paint type? I know some paints just refuse to lay flat
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like the paint I used for my.rwn guns I hatttteee
N👌kri (Marisa): it outlines all the creases perfectly <:rip:369476083248267274> hopefully paper mache will smooth it out. or make it much worse. we'll see
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Do you have accrylic cauk (is that how you spell it?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You can technically fill the cracks with that
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But regardless I'm sure it'll look fine even with a few cracks showing 👌
N👌kri (Marisa): It’s not cracks but bumps ;u; I don’t have caulk and I’m not sure if that’d work
N👌kri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!386874959009415170>  do you use makeup remover to take of tattoo paper? thats what i used but it doesnt work for tom <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): he had to use like industrial paint thinner or someshit
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OOOOHH BUMPY BOIS
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah caulk wouldn't work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah that's what I use. just takes some rubbing
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea me too <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, really need to put some pressure into scrubbing
Aldus Larian (Jess): too many exposed shoulder bois
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It looks like hammered metal so it's kinda neet tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): What did you make it out of?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye was gonna say looks like hammered metal or like, battle dents
N👌kri (Marisa): Is made of wonderflex and then I tried to smooth it out with model magic and glue but you can still see the seams <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): dunno if maybe any of these other methods would work? https://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Temporary-Tattoos
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea maybe the baby oil, thank
N👌kri (Marisa): Get sunburn and peel skin off to remove temporary tattoo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or just take a razor and slice off the first layer of epidermis
Aldus Larian (Jess): You guys severly over estimate Tom's pain tolerance 😂
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I've never worked with wonder flex personally 🤔 I know in most situations people would recommend sanding but idk.if that would work in your case
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Plus you've already painted it and it doesn't seem that noticable
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'll try to remember to buy baby oil
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I ended up using naptha lnao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I think I'll sahve my upper arm actually
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Cuz the hair was the problem
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It wouldn't let go
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea that's a good idea
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Likw. I'm not that hairy but still
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I needed naptha to get it off last time
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It was the only thing that worked and just barely
Aldus Larian (Jess): Take a little from work 😂
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nah it's not good for.you
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's basically lightr fluid
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh. Yea.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea so I guess shave and we'll try make up remover
Aldus Larian (Jess): Otherwise I guess you just be Ren with an edgy eye tattoo
Bill: Guess you need to *permanently brand yourself* a member of Mint Eye. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Two people from my freshman dorm have now followed me on instagram. huh.
N👌kri (Marisa): You can’t really sand wonderflex, it’s knockoff worbla and pretty thin. I tried sending the clay and glue down on top of it but still didn’t work, newspaper has been applied so hopefully that helps. A little.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Hopefully 🙏
Andrew: Painting my last piece for Naofumi (the belt on his shirt)
Andrew: finally gonna be done
N👌kri (Marisa): I just have to do the boots, paint the sheath and attach it to the belt, add belt loops, add the ties on the shirt and the back of the armor, paint the armor, add trim and thumbs to the gloves, add buttons and buttonholes, style the wig and tail, attach the tail to the belt and cover the top with hair, add ears to the wig, make the necktie, shape the end of the sword and paint it, paint the bracelets and hair accessories, add the belt loop, make arm and leg armor, add bolts to the shoulder piece, add Velcro to the armor, and finish the underskirt for Raphtalia.
Bill: child's play for you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!245270932602486784>  are you bringing your airmatress to next?

Bill: Trying to figure that out now.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I can bring it Ye
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Where are we figuring that out?
Bill: I not we.
Bill: Dropped the pronoun.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): YOOO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Overall quite pleased with the quality
N👌kri (Marisa): WOOO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I mentioned in the marvel group chat, definitely not made to be converted to men's
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It has space to hold tiddies
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Marisa can I borrow your boob plate?
N👌kri (Marisa): GOOD IDEA
N👌kri (Marisa): Ya
N👌kri (Marisa): You should also borrow one of tom’s collars to hide the neck seam
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then I can just do regular Nat
El🆓de Faun (Tom): IT HIM
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:rise:582318089228648456> <:rise:582318089228648456> <:rise:582318089228648456> <:rise:582318089228648456> <:rise:582318089228648456> <:rise:582318089228648456> <:rise:582318089228648456>

Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo! That looks great!
Bill: I had a suspicion but that vesus robe doesn’t have the tunic, just the cape. Which is fine I suppose?
Bill: Needs a white belt too.
Bill: But I’m also not feeling any cosplay besides Hazel at next.
Bill: Maybe Jones on Sunday.
Andrew: Ohhh I love it
Kaio Vermino (Lee):
