Bill: Hahaha. I saw a group of girls our age walking into building ahead of me. They go down stairs, camera meeting is upstairs.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Go to their meeting Instead
Bill: I almost did.
Bill: It’s the EMS squad, it’s a ambulance squad room.
Bill: Everyone here is 50+ as expected. 😂
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo time to become an emt
N🆗ri (Marisa): "im having a medical emergency. i'm hallucinating angels that take my breath away"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG Marisa no 😂
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): marisa YES
N🆗ri (Marisa): go biru go
Bill: No wayyyyy
Bill: I do want to do the camera thing tho, I came for the content not the peoplesee
Bill: Though the age gap is hella awkward.
N🆗ri (Marisa): "my heart is racing, you ladies should give me contact info if this happens again"
N🆗ri (Marisa): "they say 9-1-1 but you're all 10s in my book"
Bill: They’re in another room, I’d have to walk in there for that. And also be HIGH OUT OF MY MIND.
N🆗ri (Marisa): you're already upstairs so you're higher than they are
Bill: I couldn’t join an ems squad tho. The time commitment would be too much with my job and commute already.
Bill: Lizi used to be one.
Bill: Marisa would love this one dude. Literally 100% saturation.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's just Marisa in disguise
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s 100 or nothing and if there’s nothing then there isn’t even a picture
Bill: Marisa got fatter than me then.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's a disguise she's just inside a costume
Bill: That was neat. Two people made a point of talking to me, I tried to talk to one dude but I got caught talking to one of them. Had to say “I have prints to show, didn’t submit online” so I got a bit of a spotlight. 

People. Really like the sushi.
Bill: Nobody said any negative critique tho.
Andrew: I met a couple groups last year
Bill: Barely any positive.
Bill: Doesn’t count.
Bill: Kinda like the idea of aiming for contests.
Andrew: I mean they're more like  i know names but not really friends
Bill: New year new game.
Bill: So +1 me. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I got a couple of ideas generally too.
Bill: Also to win competition you generally need good lighting and impact. That’s going to apply to cosplay too. Impact is that big prop that everyone ooos at.
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk if anyone would be interested but here that gazebo park
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): PARK
N🆗ri (Marisa): <@!184437198865563648> posted this screenshot if it helps
Bill: Ye that the address.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i go on slide
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!!!! they have a swingset too!!!!! swing with cape or floofy skirt
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): SWING
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): POKEMON GO TOO PROB
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH THAT'S THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF
there were like 10 pokestops in that park and the police station is a gym when i last went past it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YES
Bill: It's not terribly exciting, but as we don't really have a place to meet up down by you, it'd be great for a visit and photos!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye i was like "how do i make this seem cooler than it actually is <:lenny:395307171539189760> "
i just posted it because gazebo
honestly my aunt's backyard might be more exciting for photos. OH i know a boat club that's really cool!! my grandmother is a member maybe we can look into that
Bill: true true.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): red dragon canoe club. the inside is rather old-fashioned (it's a super old building) and in spring it's really nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9c/24/ca/9c24ca71748d2d4747732c4cab05d9ef.jpg

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yooooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats like some horror movie house
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): or like rich people in the late 1800's house
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah they say the upper floors are haunted!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): my cousins and i tried to find ghosts when i was little but the doors were all locked
Dirty Lego (Tom): Ah kamistry at it again with the shibari
Bill: *implying he ever stops*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the what?
Bill: shibari is japanese rope play.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Rope tyeing that looks like it takes way too much time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i just call that "rope stuff"
Dirty Lego (Tom): It does look pretty
Dirty Lego (Tom): But fucccc that shit
Bill: That lesbean bondage comic talked quite a bit about it. Takes alot of time to setup and you have to be super careful.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Remember that guy who does the photoshoots with it
Dirty Lego (Tom): He bought his second set.of rope finally! Remember?!
Bill: I remember the guy, not anything about a second set. *have you been following him*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😬
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg can we cosplay ppgz and do the transformation dance
Bill: I remember sequences, no dance...
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm u right. then who am i thinking of with the clapping dance
N🆗ri (Marisa): doremi?
N🆗ri (Marisa): no. hmmmmmm
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait doremi does have clapping but it's not a dance
N🆗ri (Marisa): WAIT YEAH IT'S A LATER ONE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tom needs to come back as esplain
Bill: The whole thing or me making a crack about following him?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just why he knows that
Bill: The thing was a katsu photographer add I found awhile back and shared. He was advertising for bondage shoots, as a bondage expert or some shit.
Dirty Lego (Tom): He said that in the last post he made when we looked I'm up last year
Dirty Lego (Tom): I just remember
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOOO ok

Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah I remember when she first shared that she said she's doing the nightwalker I believe
Dirty Lego (Tom): But like creepy antelope form
Bill: ye.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i was gonna go but i thenk we need to change to nier by then
Bill: 3pm was the Zeikani shoot. I'm currently tempted to shrink that shoot to a half hour, so we have more time with Justin/Leanna.
Bill: Could kick it up too, assuming I don't do the 2pm BNHA shoot.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea im not terrible interested in being 2b for much loger tho XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i worked hard on san and she is new so i wanna be in her for a while
Bill: I mostly want to ensure there's enough time to do photos... It's golden hour, so if we chat too much the light's gone and that's that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but 2 pm is like early af
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats like 3 hrs before golden hour?
Bill: Oh I'd just kick up by at most a half hour.
Bill: 3 to 5:30. that's two and a half. A half hour in between the hour shoots.
Bill: The first shoot is 4? people (Zeikani/Tom/Georgia/you) and the second 5, swapping Zeikani for Justin/Leanna.
Bill: I want to do solos for A2 at some point in all that, solos for anyone else who wants them, groups, gotta have Tom get all creepy on the Nines...
Bill: If you want, skip the Zeikani shoot.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah i can do it i just didint wanna move it up by 2 hrs
Bill: I told her about you coming but I can go back on that, you busy.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IT FNE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): FINE*
Bill: FNE!
Bill: (was still typing while you responded, you just beat me to it)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOO ok
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Maybe... we can just a super shoot block...
Bill: So rather than one or two locations for each shoot, we can do everywhere with everyone...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): rip my fee
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): feet*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the only double we have is 9s?
Bill: Yeah.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Gotta post to insta... Dunno what 🤔

Bill: I'm mixing up my sketch photographers.
Bill: I was thinking and LTD.
Bill: Jpaden the awkward but nice one.
Bill: *shock retracted*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i mix them up too
Bill: ~~like, next years ANYC?~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): at otakon 2017, i was talking to dan and he pointed to a neon katt cosplayer and told ryan that he slept with her the night before
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and cause i was hovering next to ryan as my Safety Boi, i overheard
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i just now made the connection that thats zombieviscera
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _a year and a half later_
Bill: We knew that already.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i totally forgot!
Bill: Like, you and I.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): in hindsight, that was really weird that dan said that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i didnt think he was a peacock
Bill: She was the one sleeping in the room with the broken tooth jackbox games too.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): just a flaunty gay
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oh she WAS?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): am i this oblivious
Bill: ~~he's not gay?~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes pan but we all know he rocked those seamonkey photos
Bill: You sometimes miss things, yes. I'm more observant than others at time though.
Bill: He seemed pretty offronted when I said he was gay. Made it *very* clear seamonkeys was stage kissing.
Bill: Plus he and Laniebug are a couple.
Bill: In his words "two years in the making".
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): two years in the making OUT more like ayyyy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah i think they both go to college in NJ? i think?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): somewhere near here?
Bill: Maybe. He described it as a they were friends and eventually at someone they said 'hey lets try something'.
Bill: He goes to American U in DC.
Bill: Dunno anything really about her.
Bill: He lives near Rowan, Zeikani and that lot. I assume she's nearby.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: ~~wow it got rock hard telling us that~~
Dizzy: https://68.media.tumblr.com/c292dc288ec9bedb4fb7f2528c410a41/tumblr_ootvlcfBh31twgfw0o2_540.gif
Bill: !lewd
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sunstone is a good rock
She is the 90s incarnate
Bill: So... Driving to Katsu.
Bill: Tom/Jess/Me doing half day, Dave too?
Bill: We need to rescue a Marisa on the way.
Bill: Dave has to drive, he going home separate on Sunday.
Bill: If we leave around 1, we'll get there at 7. WIthout picking up Marisa.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Were prob gonna go down with Dave and come back with you but yea half day
Bill: ~~this trip is fucking nuts~~
Bill: Not that I really want to do a two hour leg of the trip myself...
N🆗ri (Marisa): I could see if meg or Courtney are doing a caravan (though I don’t think Courtney is going this year? I’ll have to check), but then I’d only stay until Sunday and I’d have to scratch off one of the Sunday cosplay plans
Bill: Nope, you're barely even a detour.
Bill: Non factor.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~im sure Dave doesn't wanna do 12 hrs by himself~~
Bill: Mmkay. So it'll be approx 5 hours with Marisa.
Bill: I can probably leave earlier without you two, because yeet.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He's already doing 6 and Its likely we'll have to leave a little later than 1
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz my "half day" is 12:30 I'll get home at 12:40 there's no way we'd be able to make it to your house and leave by 1
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): This way Dave and Tom can come from work, they can start loading the car before I even get home, and we can leave from here
Bill: ~~I was going to estimate in reality for 2~~
Bill: Marisa do you know how long badge pick up is open for?
Bill: based off prior years?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I wanna say until 10 or so?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait 11pm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We made it last year
Bill: Trying to think about when all the spicy stuff and dinner are going to go down.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye we got our badges at 10:30 last year, no line
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sunday night could work
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Me Tom have alot more room in our shedule then Marisa so do her first
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What's the bed situation?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m not gonna leave til late Thursday so I’m gonna grab my badge whenever I have free time Friday
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Prob before the RWBY pajama party
Bill: I put us 6 (Tom/Jess/Me/Georgia/Marisa/Dave) in one room. Asked Dave if he wanted the additional space to go to the other room, he said he'd rather do with us. Other 4 are in the other. Rooms will hopefully connect. 

I'm sleeping on a bed. Dave'll share with me, so that's him.
Bill: I don't think I need to assign everyone else.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But the Georgia said she might go over to other room? Maybe
Bill: That's her choice.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Will you be able to access all areas of the con without a badge Georgia? They might block access to the lower atrium
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Obviously
Bill: You do need to tell that to the group though Georgia; unless you plan on being the one to bring air mattress.
Bill: I dunno if Scott and Tristan are going to share a bed.
Bill: Marisa has good point, I wonder how that works.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm old I need a bed 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Too bad they don't have couches in the rooms
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t really care I have a resilient back
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I never have back problems sleeping any way
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And yeah that’s what I’m worried about
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Thursday is Valentine’s Day tho
Bill: which is relevant.... how?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): To spend time with someone not going to con
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's relevant cuz she won't be able to get there Thursday night
Bill: aaah, that's what you mean.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): In time for badge pick uo
Bill: You'll be an overnight guest in a room, once you have a card key you should be fine.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You don't have to jump on her like that 🙄
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have a pink camouflage sleeping bag I can bring. I’ll blend right into the floor no one will be able to see me.
Bill: *I was not sure how valentines day was relevant to her not having back problems sleeping on an air mattress.*
Bill: *I connected her statement to the wrong message.*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): K
N🆗ri (Marisa): Holidays make arthritis flare up
Bill: Probably Marisa.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So with a keycard I’ll be good for Friday morning?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea you should be ok with the key card
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz that will signify you are "hotel guest"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I wonder if they’re just checking outside the Gaylord then
Bill: That'd be my guess. Still worth getting your badge asap in the morning though.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah I’ll find some time
Bill: We can try and pick up your badge too.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If possible, I would be eternally grateful
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Not sure if it is tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They are probably checking in the lobby? I'd imagine?
Bill: They likely will want to see ID to get the badge tho ye.
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Pls sir I have a keycard pls let me into yaoi 101”
Usually they don’t let you pick up badges for someone else. You’d also need Georgia’s photo ID ye
Bill: All the close lots are full up. That sketchy one has 83 spots left.
Bill: For parking.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Saturday night mugging awwwww yeah. Classic Katsu.
Bill: Gaylord has 30 dollar a day self park, 50 valet.
Bill: I'm assume valet should have space, worst comes to worst.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The parking garage down the street isn’t bad
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I parked there last year
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 60-70 total for weekend?
Bill: Sounds about right, national harbor parking is 22 bucks a night as far as I can tell.
Bill: How late are you thinking you'll get to the con Georgia?
Bill: Not like, 2am right?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Prob like 11
Bill: Okay cool, I'm not worried about being awake then.
Bill: weird phrasing; I don't have to worry about staying awake till really late to make sure you can get into the room.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm going to bed at 8:30
Bill: *am*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): When I clock in
Bill: Georgia, all good if you want to switch rooms (I'm putting you in charge of the room if you do), just need to decide with enough time that Marisa can get sleeping arrangements sorted out.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): In that case 2 single air mattresses would be prime but I don't know if anyone has those 😂
Bill: <@!228287793099440128> 's the only one I know of.
Bill: We can do Wedding Maki in the time we're waiting for Tom and Jess, as well as get badges.
Bill: Or wait to get badges all together, that may be smarter.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Don't matta
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean I’m bringing an air mattress regardless
Bill: If Marisa fine hopping rooms with you that works then for both scenarios, but if she wants to stay with Aurii fam, she'll need her own things if you go over.
