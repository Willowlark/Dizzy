N🆗ri (Marisa): free advertising
viz media give me money
Bill: Apparently two day shipping from china is possible.
Bill: So.
Bill: Hazel later.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): whooo!
Bill: can't wait for it to not fit. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: https://www.wilderness.net/toolboxes/documents/50th/Photo%20contest%20judging%20form.doc <- here's a sample judge card. I heard judging described once, basically judges don't see the photographers name and just judge the image in a vaccum, then later you get your scores.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wouldn't want to enter a contest
N🆗ri (Marisa): you wouldn't even have to disclose who took what pictures, just see what people like about the images
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa whens your panel on saturday?
N🆗ri (Marisa): tooth hurty
Aldus Larian (Jess): nice 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): what time is everyone planning on getting there
Bill: I mean to say using the contest 'judge without knowing the photographer' style.
Bill: Though.
Bill: I can probably tell if you gave me a photo from Rebecca, Hunter, or Marisa.
Bill: I know their styles really well.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg quick everyone go find images
N🆗ri (Marisa): new game
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok im postin 3 pictures whose is whose?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: How old are they?
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *I know their current styles Mawisa*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd say 2+ years maybe
N🆗ri (Marisa): *go go guess*
Bill: Rebecca, Marisa, Hunter?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 1/3
Bill: Switch Hunter and Rebecca?
Bill: err.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 0/3
Bill: idk.
N🆗ri (Marisa): :3c
Bill: current styles.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is me, webecca, hunter
Bill: ~~congrats on being my favorite of the lot~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): that merida was really pretty and nice and then never gave me contact info to send her pictures
N🆗ri (Marisa): pretty eyes
N🆗ri (Marisa): i had her tumblr and sent her asks but she never responded and like, never went online after that kotoricon
Bill: Riiiip
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it bad to promote yourself at the end of a panel
most people put contact info at the end but all my contact info is my cosplay pages and that might come across as like. paid promotion for myself.
Bill: nah.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i feel like thats normal?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hope. i can put my tumblr which is how i've found a lot of panelists in the past, but my tumblr url is really long
N🆗ri (Marisa): like otakon girl who did the panel on noragami and shintoism that was really neat
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg I wanna go to that
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was neat!!! i wonder if there's a video
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh hunter had messaged me what do
Bill: oh that yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): not on youtube <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: He has more interesting in Casey than I do, so maybe he should get an invite...? ~~Just don't bring up LGBTQ rights with him and Ethan together~~

~~... at least without popcorn~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): id invite him, if it were me, but it's up to you and how much you can deal with in one night xD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): imma do it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it mah house
N🆗ri (Marisa): what about something like this
*powerpoint isn't letting me use the design button anymore and my slides look atrocious*
jess can i use this picture you took of me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): what are we even doing when casey and ethan come that friday night
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye of course
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Dinner? And...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Um...
Bill: *Listening to Ethan talk about himself*
Bill: 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): BANNER MADE
Aldus Larian (Jess): LmFAo please
N🆗ri (Marisa): Set down some popcorn and be like “so. What do you think of lgbtqa+ rights?”
N🆗ri (Marisa): play a game of hangman but make the man vaguely resemble ethan
N🆗ri (Marisa): play hide and seek and just leave the premises
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im all for that last idea
N🆗ri (Marisa): tell him to count really loud so he doesn't hear the car starting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ERIK CAN I ACTUALLY PRINT THAT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Debating hanging it up but it’s funny
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol sure
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): how much betty boop can i force people to watch
N🆗ri (Marisa): 20 seconds. for 20 seconds you must endure.
Bill: It here
Bill: Hazel apparently has leg? Bands? Which are a loose fit on me (yo everything in this size down order from the last one fits big and that’s a triiiip) and will need pin and same for this gut? Belt? But damn.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Damn?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Good damn then?
N🆗ri (Marisa): You gonna grow sideburns or use wig?
Bill: Verrrry good damn.
Bill: I was worried ordering an XXL would be too small after the long wait.
Bill: Hell, I think maaaaaybe a XL would work.
Bill: Cause of how light the fabric is.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Naw see. You overestimate how big you are.
Bill: do you how often *that's* happened? Never.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ya gonna wear him for Kogara?
Bill: I am most definitely feeling it so...
N🆗ri (Marisa): Would you be up for a photography exchange?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Or if you’re not bringing a camera then just getting pictures done? :3c
Bill: Absolutely not!
Bill: I'd shoot you no matter what!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wow can’t believe Biru is threatening me with violence for suggesting a photoshoot
N🆗ri (Marisa): For his cool new cosplay
Bill: And also like. Ngl, yes tho? I actually *fit* this and look *good*. I definitely prefer cosplaying a character with a large build.
Bill: There is no cosplay I've done before I'd have been interested in solos for before. This one.
Bill: I just spent 20 minutes trying to figure out Barry's holster.
Bill: I did not do it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): when people interested in doing photos because i've got a schedule forming oops
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it's already taken up all but 2 hours of the con so i'm gonna stop planning until i make plans with people here
Bill: How there’s like nothing at Kogara con.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a con there's always stuff to do at a con
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh i need to view the dealers and artists and bazaar there goes another 30 minutes <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Cancel everything you have to play with us all day.
N🆗ri (Marisa): aim to arrive at around 10:30, shop then if that works out
homestuck meetup 11am
game show 12-2
panel 2:00 (check-in) - 3:30
free time!
homestuck panel 5:30-6:30
N🆗ri (Marisa): y'all'd get bored of me
N🆗ri (Marisa): the game show might suck idk there's not a lot about it
N🆗ri (Marisa): the katwalk is 3:35-4:30 maybe i'll go watch that
N🆗ri (Marisa): free time is from 4:30-5:10 how's that sound <:lenny:395307171539189760> 40 minutes of hangout
Aldus Larian (Jess): Not enough
Aldus Larian (Jess): Das why I come home with us
Aldus Larian (Jess): HOURS of hangoit
N🆗ri (Marisa): i also willing to change certain aspects of schedule because we gotta shoot and do karaoke and high five
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's not a lot of info about the homestuck meetup. they made and advertised it in late february/early march and then never made any more posts about it
Bill: Okay so. Hazel and Barry both fit. I have three props for Barry. I gotta get dust crystals from Fye for Hazel. Both are *somehow too big* ☺ but wearable, Hazel just needs some pins to hold up leg... bands, and the trailing piece of belt.
Bill: ~~inb4 I go by another size down from ez *just* because I apparently can.~~
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> if you didn't decide for Kogara.... 👀 Hit me with a hammer.
Bill: Oh and I have no idea what do about Hazel's beard. cause I can't grow one.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o maybe because we don't see each other often y'all don't know this but i have to plan everything because constant nervous wreck. can't do something spontaneous, can't go somewhere without knowing exactly what i'm going to be doing there. that's why i bother everyone with questions about everything <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: *sharpie probably*
N🆗ri (Marisa): eyeshadow!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm prob just doing MC
Bill: Eh, Georgia the same way. I'm getting better at it. I can plan periods of unplanned time.
Bill: No worries.
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's fine Marisa I totally get that
N🆗ri (Marisa): *but what do you do with unplanned time*
Bill: Spend time with the people around me.
Bill: It works.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Constantly worry that I'm wasting time
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if there's no one around you
Bill: at a con.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah
Bill: nope.
Bill: Doesn't happen.
Bill: Cause.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i thought you weren't good at talking to strangers :0
Bill: *You can just say where are you to anyone here and we'll tell you cause we want you with us*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Doesnt kogara have a no prob policy?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what time are we meeting for Kogara?
Bill: No idea.
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can have props but they're strict
N🆗ri (Marisa): mostly usual con rules tho
http://kogaracon.com/rules/
Bill: yeah, I *think* people can tell that the hammer is fake.
N🆗ri (Marisa): technically it is real and it is a hammer
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
N🆗ri (Marisa): once a kid in my class was doing a book report on abraham lincoln: vampire hunter and we had to dress up (12th grade) so he printed a stock image of a machete from the library and brought it to class
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk I'm kinda Nored out
Bill: 😭
Bill: I am late to the party though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Other people are doing rwby tho right?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jess and Bill need to do a shoot where Jess lifts Bill and yeets him through a building
Aldus Larian (Jess): Erik I can barely like 25 lbs
Bill: Hazel and Nora fight in the show.
Bill: That's why I say you specifically.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye but idk if I wanna do Nora 😔
Bill: It fine Jess.
Bill: The only other characters Hazel can pair with, shoot wise, are Salem (kinda), Adam (also kinda), Emerald and Merc (eh), and then Oscar/Ozpin.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't even know who's coming
Bill: Which I can get Salem eventually with Monica, and Zeikani wanted to do Oscar so that'd be a neat idea.
N🆗ri (Marisa): anna, rebecca, erik, biru, tom, jess, marisa, is leanna coming?
Bill: yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah she doin penny
Aldus Larian (Jess): Neato
Bill: Rebecca is Sun, Leanna is Raven, Erik is Tai, Anna is Ironwood(?).
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Was only a suggestion Jess, no worries.
N🆗ri (Marisa): where the homestucks
Bill: Hunter.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wait
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Since when does Leanna do Raven?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i figured she made a new outfit
Bill: errr
Bill: Leanna Penny.
N🆗ri (Marisa): did i edit my post to avoid embarassment for noTHING BIRU
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHY U DO THIS TO ME
Bill: ?
Bill: ohhh lol
Bill: Oh Kurto coming too.
Bill: Dunno what he cosplaying if he is.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think the girl who took my pyrrha pics is going. how many years has it been since i didn't get my pictures back
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: *yes and*
N🆗ri (Marisa): u will pay
N🆗ri (Marisa): a grave mistake
Bill: I said that to Erik but are you threatening me Marisa?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~Leanna do Raven so I have someone who's not Rebecca or Heather to cosplay with~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye because your raven mistake made me look bad
Bill: ~~there's only one more spot left on the Dominos logo, do you want to do this~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): is there a time i can move my suitcase into someone's car before bojo leaves
N🆗ri (Marisa): it might be difficult to bring it with me everywhere at the con
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye! I'm not sure who's driving yet but def
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank you i'm sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): No apologize
N🆗ri (Marisa): does anyone know what they'll be doing at all during the con because i'm worried if i don't schedule anything that i'll regret it and miss everything, but if i do a schedule then you all will be busy during the times i allot for hanging out
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm sorry for being a nuisance
Aldus Larian (Jess): I go to your panel at 2:30
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): If rebecca would let me borrow her raven cosplay maybe
N🆗ri (Marisa): *the raven cosplayer arrives*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But otherwise fuck no
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's the only thing I have hard planned
N🆗ri (Marisa): ew why'd you plan to go to that mess
Elfriede Faun (Tom): cuz love and friendship
Elfriede Faun (Tom): lpus you did the RE S E A R C H
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe go to game show with you
N🆗ri (Marisa): if anyone shows up to that i won't be able to talk with you guys though. if it's just aurii and bne then we can be chill but if it's anything like my previous panels there won't be any time or chance for chillin
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's not gonna be a mess it be GUD
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm still making the powerpoint <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah I was see your presentation
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yeah well behave
Aldus Larian (Jess): I know you won't be able to shoot the shit
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm betting on there being some kind of technical problem <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then we help!
N🆗ri (Marisa): tom can come to the panel but he has to have his collar on ok jess <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Chris is probably gonna go too, separate cars from me tho because he likes to leave early lol but he prob will go to your panel too marisa!
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): everyone is free to leave whenever i'm literally starting the history of weebs 40.000 years ago and then we jump to the year 700
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i think he's doing seven but uhh ok if that's what you want~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): That sounds great
N🆗ri (Marisa): dunno what he'll do he's unpredictable
Aldus Larian (Jess): If he wears seven he's cosplay obligated to help you solve technical issues
N🆗ri (Marisa): "hey can u help me, the sound isn't working and pictures aren't showing up"
"yeah sure" 2 minutes later "here's all the classified data of cambodia's government"
Aldus Larian (Jess): And a cat presentation
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if i can't get pics of everyone tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): Das ok!
Bill: yup.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jost worry about panel!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 😢
Bill: Asides from your panel, tbh I'll probably wander into dealers in the morning then want to shoot all day.
Aldus Larian (Jess): If I don't do MC I'll prob do Hiyori or tiny V
N🆗ri (Marisa): tiny v
Bill: ~~accurate V you mean~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or Seven if Tom doesn't do him
N🆗ri (Marisa): t i n y v
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm 5'3"
N🆗ri (Marisa): like. being carried on everyone's backs and hiding in people's pockets.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Not accurate at all 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): tiny v
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye! V.tiny
Bill: Ye but you. look like V.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Only smol
Bill: better than tol and not looking like him.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's all in the aviators
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do I wanna be Tom's girlfriend, or dad?
N🆗ri (Marisa): size comparison tiny v vs grape
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's me!
Bill: Maybe if Gen doesn't end up in Fate hell and redoes Nora that'd work.
Bill: Sometime.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is gen going?
Bill: ~~She's going to end up in Fate hell~~
Bill: Nope.
Bill: I'm talking long term.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I mean I'll do Nora again at some point
Bill: <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just not right now 😂 I did her at every con for a year
Bill: The real trick is convincing people to cosplay resident evil.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Can't help you there
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh i know some
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa save da day
N🆗ri (Marisa): my dead brother in law cosplayed it so i know of people in that circle
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! I'm sorry 😔
N🆗ri (Marisa): is ok is a very long complex story
N🆗ri (Marisa): am very anxious
Bill: <@!245270932602486784>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Her hairs red?
Bill: reddish brown. The new model has her more brunette.
Bill: But. It's always dark in the new game so she's in shadow most of the time.
Bill: *fuck* I forgot "is from a video game, not an anime"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You are mistaken, I’m not allowed to be comfortably
Bill: 1. Vault suit
2. Gym uniform
Bill: I’m also not serious, the version of Barry I got is from a game Claire isn’t in. You’d be cosplaying *yet another* of my favorite characters, and you’d *slay*, but do it cause you want to if you do.
Bill: Unrelated. The white shirt with the RPD logo on it for under the vest is like, athletic wear and white so pretty see through. You uh. Find someone ripped, it’d be quality redfield boudoir material.
Bill: I’m ashamed that’s what I first thought of. XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): am sad but here's where i'll be i guess
Bill: Just. Skip the catwalk and come shoot. everyone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't be sad!
N🆗ri (Marisa): but what if you guys are busy then
Bill: We aren’t.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol we're never busy
N🆗ri (Marisa): yalways busy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nop
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's a mix of y'all and always see what i did there
N🆗ri (Marisa): everyone was busy all the time at zenkai and katsu tho, when you get to the con you'll find something
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah we never busy. At Zenkai I was like "o I'm bored let's go see if Marisa's at dealers"
Aldus Larian (Jess): At katsu I wasnt really busy just nuerotic about never cosplay change
Bill: Katsu is always fucking busy it's why I hate it.
Bill: I was busy running rwby shoot, but otherwise Zenkai was go where I pleased.
N🆗ri (Marisa): we all busy at katsu. at zenkai i felt like i was already interrupting and getting in the way of your stuff
Aldus Larian (Jess): Noooo! Not at all!
Bill: Nope.
Aldus Larian (Jess): We missed you the whole time 😭
Bill: Yeah, I was literally frustrated cause YOU were so busy all day at Katsu.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's ok you don't have to go out of your way to say stuff like that, i want to know when i'm being a bother
Aldus Larian (Jess): I must have said "I wish Marisa was here" like 50 times
Bill: Okay Marisa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): But we're not 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know you guys were being extra nice at zenkai and i appreciated it but you don't gotta
Bill: You're only a bother when you imply that I do anything for you I don't want to.
Aldus Larian (Jess): We truley enjoy your company, I know you won't believe it but I'mma keep telling you anyway
Bill: I'm not being *extra nice*. I want you around.
Bill: Don't tell me otherwise.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MORE 👏 MARISA 👏 MORE 👏 MARISA
Bill: That's when you are quote being a bother. I love having you with us and want you around all day, not just for the time we do get you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea Marisa is big fun!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm out of ladder shades though
Aldus Larian (Jess): That ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have police stickers
Bill: I don't care what you bring. So long as you come.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): i made the schedule because i figured no one wanted to hang out. i can not follow most things, but i may run back to it because i am garbage.
Bill: Do *not* assume I am ever being "extra nice" or treating you any way I don't *want* to treat you.
Bill: When I say I don't lie, I mean it. My honesty is important to me, that I act exactly how I feel and believe. So implying that I'm faking being nice to you will bother me.
Bill: Protip. I never would have invited you to Aurii if I didn't love you already, and knew that everyone else important to me would too.
Bill: Like, I *literally* thought you wouldn't be into role playing games but invited you anyway. The fact that you're the Most Dedicated Player *continues* to astound me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i honestly can't believe that anyone would ever like me for any reason. i'm convinced my family hates me and everyone i know. i can accept that we're all close friends but i'll only make you suffer my presence in small doses. you get enough of me on the internet where i don't shut up.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the fact you haven't started aurii season 2 yet continues to astound me *chop chop people*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i ain't the most dedicated player did you see the novels that tom and georgia were writing. when is that book coming out
Bill: You're the one who still wants to play.
Bill: Most dedicated.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The Girl Who Is Racist Against Furries Yet Falls In Love With A Furry
Bill: And how about you let *us* decide how much Marisa is too much for us.
Bill: We know better than you.
Bill: If there is ever a time I did want space from you, and I'm technically still an introvert eventually it could happen, *I* will tell you I need that space and when I get it I will come right back.
Bill: Don't assume.
Bill: It makes an ass out of you and me.
Bill: I'd suffer more *not* getting to see you all day than I ever could being around you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): consider: a horse girl in elementary school but 10x worse
Bill: And you may not believe that, and that's okay. But if you can't have that confidence in yourself right now have confidence that in me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nice gurren lagann reference
Bill: unintentionally but fitting.
Bill: I wouldn't look as a good shirtless.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Birus all about that tough love stuff but yea we love you for reals.
Bill: It's very Jumin of me isn't it. ☺
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is that where all my self worth went
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOVE 👏 MARISA 👏 LOVE 👏 MARISA
Aldus Larian (Jess): You have lots of self worth! You just haven't found it yet.
Aldus Larian (Jess): If you can't make your own self worth, store bought will do
Bill: or handmade!
Bill: You can sell it on etsy when you have leftover!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wouldn't that be the same as making your own 😮
Bill: There are youtube tutorials.
N🆗ri (Marisa): @ georgia
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is biru abusing his powers again
Bill: You keep lennying, next step to tough love is taking away your ability to do reacts for a week.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ya
N🆗ri (Marisa): nO
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~let her express herself~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i don't react to everything how will people know their messages are being read
Bill: No 👏 you 👏 is 👏 banned 👏
N🆗ri (Marisa): guess i'm banned bye guys
Bill: I love your reacts Mawisa.
Bill: I do.
Aldus Larian (Jess): No! 😭
Bill: But you keep breaking the nou ban.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u do
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao

Dizzy: Here's what I have.
