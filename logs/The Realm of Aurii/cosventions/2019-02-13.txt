Bill: I lost one lens out of three but got everything.
Bill: Twas important to me anyway.

N🆗ri (Marisa): omg does anyone use tictoc
I’ll download it but I got a really good idea for Saeran and Ray
Bill: None of Aurii.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Time to download
N🆗ri (Marisa): I just have a neat video idea it doesn’t even need to be tictoc
Bill: Can do that. or tictok.
Bill: Man, I wish we could get down there at 2-3.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Skip work
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s so weird not getting there at like noon
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i wish i could get there like now
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nooo I’m still sewing
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess do you know of Bo Burnham
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no
Bill: he's funny.
N🆗ri (Marisa): He has this song
He’s a comedian
The song is about his left brain and his right brain I think it’d be good for ray and Saeran
“I am the left brain I am the left brain I work really hard till my inevitable death brain. You’ve got a lot to do you better do it right and the right way is with the left brain’s might”
“I am the right brain. I have feelings. Im a little all over the place but I’m lustful, trustful, and I’m lookin for somebody to Love”

this song is more lewd than I remembered but we can cut those out
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its so angsty in context with searan ~~i love it~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): it’s catchy it’s been stuck in my head
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): youll have to convince tom over his adversion to tik tok tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): We just take regular video then
N🆗ri (Marisa): And make it cool in video editing software
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont even know how tiktok works
N🆗ri (Marisa): clock noises
N🆗ri (Marisa): O wow this wig is longer than I thought. It’s nice.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I like the bow
N🆗ri (Marisa): Does anyone mind if I attack this wig with hairspray in the hotel tub and then wash away any hairspray that got in the tub
I gotta make the bangs poofy but that’ll be hard and bulky to transport
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): I could go outside and do it too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nah you good
