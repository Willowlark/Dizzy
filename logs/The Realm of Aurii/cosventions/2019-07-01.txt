Bill: ya'll still get dibs on ota shoots so... Ask away.
Bill: @ the no u on charging 20 bucks: If I charged it would be 40-60. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): If I end up going ( up in the air now bc jobless) I'd love to get photos of cap marvel o3o
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): lmao the heads
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LMAO WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): suspenseful!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also I don‚Äôt wanna be that guy but when did we start adding significant others to BNE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause I‚Äôm pretty sure most of us haven‚Äôt met Travis
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): who
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also I‚Äôm in a bad mood cause my kids were shits at study hall so this may slightly color my commentary
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): waht
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rebecca added that dude she‚Äôs been seeing I‚Äôm pretty sure
Aldus Larian (Jess): well theres no rules so theres no backing to say no
Nokri (Marisa): he said they were friends üëÄ
i've met him!!
Nokri (Marisa): what's the beach event?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): its a private beach event thats not private
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jenkinsons?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): sarah just insists on it being private to alienate creeps
Nokri (Marisa): is it in opposition to the other private not private cosplay beach event?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): no i think its the same
Nokri (Marisa): oh, are there two pages for one event?
Bill: There are no rules for BNE invites and he's a cosplayer who goes to cons BNE attends. Besides, can't fault her for getting some love and attention.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): a-are there?
Bill: Better than pining after Erik.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Can‚Äôt fault her but I feel like most of us haven‚Äôt met him
Nokri (Marisa): This?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Even if Noah started cosplaying I wouldn‚Äôt invite him lol
Nokri (Marisa): he's like, one of the few people i know in bne lol
Bill: No one knows Ginny and we added her.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh I don‚Äôt have that event
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have the private one
Nokri (Marisa): this one is private
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): People know Ginny!
Bill: Hell, I don't think Gen has met most of the group in person. She sticks with the RTX people.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): People know Gen too if you look at Instagram Mughals
Nokri (Marisa): are there legit two opposing beach day events at the same place <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Alyssa and Sarah used to run it together
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised
Nokri (Marisa): this one is run by alyssa
Bill: Instagram mutuals doesn't mean friends.
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe thats the... "issue"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmm I disagree
Nokri (Marisa): maybe sarah made another one
Bill: Sarah's event is a mess with her filtering process.
Bill: A public one makes more sense.
Nokri (Marisa): there are people they don't want coming to the event though, there are ban lists
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ban lists are like... dumb
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs public beach
Nokri (Marisa): we build a wall of sand
Nokri (Marisa): cosplay sand fortress to block out the neeners
Nokri (Marisa): i still can't get over it. i'm just imagining like, a romeo and juliet-esque thing where there are two cosplay beach parties that hate each other and one cosplayer from each befriend each other and try to stop the fighting by making a *third* cosplay beach event at exactly the same time and day hehehehe
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just don‚Äôt get the ban list
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs a public beach
Nokri (Marisa): it's mainly a list of people the cosplayers shouldn't interact with because they're huge creeps/perverts
Nokri (Marisa): people who get handsy with strangers and whatnot. i've met some of the people on the ban list and they're there for good reasons
Nokri (Marisa): but they still go around trying to befriend cosplayers, so i think the ban list is basically to say "if you know these people, don't bring them along or invite them because they've been kicked out of events in the past"
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like a "soft ban"
Bill: Yeah. I don't think it really works they way they do it, but they want the creeps to not know the event is happening ideally or at worst, warn people about creeps who are going to make the cosplayers uncomfortable in swim wear.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah they try to make it so the creeps don‚Äôt find out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But that also makes it so new cosplayers can‚Äôt find it
Bill: iirc Sarah has had some serious issues with harassment in the past so she's a little zealous about it, but she's doing it for the good of the event and the safety of attendees. Not everyone has a safety Tom or handler to discourage harassment.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They should just have people watching out for the people on the ban list
Nokri (Marisa): *but why are there two private events???*
what happened i'm dying to know omg there's a good story here somewhere
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Probably
Bill: wait both are private?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Considering Sarah and alyssa used to do it together
Bill: Omg that's hilarious.
Bill: I thought one was public.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah, the one run by alyssa is private. i assume the one run by sarah is as well?
Bill: Yup.
Bill: There was a public one last year in AC.
Nokri (Marisa): are they the same day?
Bill: I remember seeing the invite.
Nokri (Marisa): i feel like the one run by alyssa is the "main" one because it has the people who go every year, unless they were invited to both events? how many does the other one have?
Bill: Not sure.
Nokri (Marisa): were you invited?
Bill: ye
Nokri (Marisa): can u screenshot the event page and responses if possible? üôè
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Nokri (Marisa): like, just the number
Nokri (Marisa): O THANK
Nokri (Marisa): so t's basically the same?????? omg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So weirddds
Bill: I should try and go to one of these, I could use the swimsuit photo practice before CCE. Or us lot could just go to beach.
Nokri (Marisa): are meg/flora/courtney on the list? they've been going since like the first cosplay beach day and they're in this group
Nokri (Marisa): OH THAT ONE IS IN JULY! THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!
Nokri (Marisa): the one i'm in is in august
Nokri (Marisa): but aside from that they're exactly the samert ayrhstjdykjhgefeagshdj
Bill: Meg and Flora.
Nokri (Marisa): fascinating
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think Alyssa‚Äôs is the formal one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Nokri (Marisa): thank y'all for checking ~~i wanna ask alyssa about it at otakon i'm so curious~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That‚Äôs the spot they take the picture EVERY year
Nokri (Marisa): yee as tradition dictates
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They had 150 people show up for the pic in 2015
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs just gone downhill from there
Bill: The risk of sand in camera is really high...
Bill: Maybe not go.
Bill: Also both of the last two years I was worried about being seen as a creep...
Bill: Still. Should plan a saturday to go to the beach in July or August, as a group.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What cosplays should we do?
Bill: No cosplay is fine. ~~Marisa will cosplay anyway but~~
Nokri (Marisa): i only have a few swimsuit cosplays suitable for beach
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My hero acadootnoot when
Nokri (Marisa): that's cce right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh true
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Non gender bent acadootnoot when LOL
Nokri (Marisa): oooooo
Nokri (Marisa): i don't have tsuyu's swimsuit <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You can use any
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You‚Äôll look good in them all!
Nokri (Marisa): b-but canon <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: She only likes to do canon cosplay.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I donate to Mawisas kofi!
Nokri (Marisa): i can do non-canon under certain circumstances, like the homestuck/sailor moon crossover, or super casual ladybug i did at the matsuri
Nokri (Marisa): coffee is a drug evil
Aldus Larian (Jess): u realize there is caffeine in chocolate right?
Nokri (Marisa): jess
Bill: Anyway I did not mean cosplay beach, just aurii goes to the beach.
Nokri (Marisa): jess pls
Aldus Larian (Jess): it truuuu
Nokri (Marisa): shhhhh
Nokri (Marisa): shh h
Nokri (Marisa): sh
Nokri (Marisa): hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): it's like
injections
such a tiny amount. so infinitesimal. it'd take ten billion chocolates to equal one piece of coffee bean
Nokri (Marisa): barely there
Nokri (Marisa): not there at all
Nokri (Marisa): (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
Bill: Beach or Hershey. Remembered I wanted to go to Hershey this summer like, back in the winter.
Nokri (Marisa): how do i delete someone else's message on discord <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 1 cup of chocolate ship has as much caffine as a cup of coffee
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Aldus Larian (Jess): beach, Hershey expensive
Nokri (Marisa): you can't even spell coffee with most of the letters in chocolate
Aldus Larian (Jess): but marisa can get caffeine i mean chocolate there
Nokri (Marisa): we go to hersey so i can ask mr hershey himself
Nokri (Marisa): about how much coffee they don't use
Bill: True, tickets for hershey were pretty bank. But I haven't been in the park in a decade.
Nokri (Marisa): in their pure chocolate
Bill: Hence why I wanna go.
Bill: That and the hershey gardens, cause pretty and camera. When I'm usually at hershey everything is dead.
Bill: Mr Hershey dead but there's a ride that explains the chocolate making process at Chocolate World. They have singing cows.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think i went there once
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hershey nice. My ex used to live 20 minutes away and she'd buy us passes for the year. Much expense tho. Probs why she was broke towards the end of our relationship
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Well, one of the reasons
Aldus Larian (Jess): tickets are regularly $70 a piece ouch
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeeeeaaahhh
Bill: 
Bill: They are discounted for the next hour to 46.95 though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ha haha
Nokri (Marisa): we can't get that much money in an hour
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If you went often, the passes were worth it because you'd go like 3 or 4 times and it'd be the equivalent of 3 or 4 visits and then any time after that you'd be getting your money's worth
Bill: ~~we couldn't get everyone to agree to want to go in an hour~~
Bill: where's that one friend who always has a butt load of free passes to an amusement park? Every anime has one of those.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well as it would happen, life is not an anime
Bill: Yes there would be far less depression if this was anime.
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk man there are alot of sad animes
Nokri (Marisa): bold of you to assume that anime characters aren't some of the most depressed things in existence
Bill: Eh if Tomoya gets the girl at the end of Clannad, it's a happy ending.
Bill: Cause Clannad's the fucking ringer.
Nokri (Marisa): clannad is child's play
Aldus Larian (Jess): why tho?
Nokri (Marisa): tomoya gets the girl ||but then she dies and their child dies so if it's a 'happy ending' it's still horribly tragic for tomoya, who's so depressed at losing his wife that he neglects his child for most of her life||
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no i know that i mean why is it the ringer
Bill: Because he goes through all that?
Nokri (Marisa): [anime voice] pathetic
Bill: Also everything gets fixed in the finale cause of magical love robot or whatever.
Nokri (Marisa): parasyte was good. it has one of my top 10 anime moments
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mixed up "ringer" with "kicker" so i didnt get it
Bill: aaaah lol
Nokri (Marisa): hey biru you should watch made in abyss
Bill: tried.
Nokri (Marisa): isn't it cute
||https://media.tenor.com/images/cf1e7ed18a9d28d06f5caaa6f1aec559/tenor.gif||
Nokri (Marisa): i was hoping maquia was going to be sad. i was ready for the feels trip and it let me down. like, yeah it's sad but it's just run of the mill anime sad.
Nokri (Marisa): i don't think i ever finished haibane renmei or sukutte moratte mo ii desu ka <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know what any of those are <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): sukutte moratte is basically the promised neverland except instead of being food, the children are weapons who willingly throw their lives away to fight monsters threatening the world!

haibane renmei is about people with wings and no memory!

Nokri (Marisa): it reminds me of last exile which i also have to finish aaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): OHH NOO üò≠
Nokri (Marisa): full moon o sagashite was pretty messed up for a kid's magical girl show
Nokri (Marisa): main character is dying of throat cancer and gets her magical wish granted by the reapers who come to claim her soul, then carries them around as toys while she tries to find her childhood friend with her new magic powers before she dies
Nokri (Marisa): yay!!

Aldus Larian (Jess): OH
Aldus Larian (Jess): what a friendlyshow
Andrew: Happy Ota month yall
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): dOnt RemiND mE
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): oh and it okay cuz clannad ends with the world magically getting better!
Bill: So I was thinking of making a photographer bar meetup at Otakon. Like the TAZ one Mak goes to at Katsu, in the lobby of the hotel.
Bill: But I can't decide on a date and time.
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk the ota schedule so i cant advise
Bill: I figure most photographers are on their own shoot schedules. So I was thinking like after sunset, but I know I like to eat and catch up with everyone after I finish shooting for the day...
Bill: Thought thursday, but not everyone is at a con on thursday.
Bill: I'd put it to a poll on the event but I doubt anyone will be engaged enough to do it. If anyone even takes interest, I have no idea how popular a photographer meetup would come off.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd say just do it. Yolo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): worst case scenario, you're just at the bar and can drink
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then invite friendos to join you
Bill: Implying everyone won't have their own plans.
Bill: *But if I hang out with my perfect friends all the time I don't meet people blahdy blah blah...*
Bill: friday night.
Bill: Done.
Bill: fsux.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh theres one i dont get
Aldus Larian (Jess): what does that mean
Bill: It's from megatokyo. Largo used it in place of fuck.
Nokri (Marisa): OwO
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Owo
Bill: Which in itself is a twist on fsck, which is a disk checker in unix operating systems.
Bill: Like I said, done.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats the nerdiest thing ive ever heard
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait so why did you say fuck after planning it then?
Bill: Cause new people is really stressful for me. But I can't just hang out with the squad forever cause I won't meet anyone I could date if I do.
Bill: Especially new people that I'm not meeting through a mutual friend.
Bill: All I need in life is everyone here and a girlfriend, I don't want more than that XD
Bill: But better to choose stressed over depressed, cause there's a ~~slight~~ chance stressed can get me closer to that goal. *Though I'm sure if anyone does come, it'll be middle aged men looking to show off knowing ~~casey sanders~~ various famous people.*
Bill: TMI, probably. My bad.
Nokri (Marisa): I think the wording makes it sound like you made the photography meetup to meet girls <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: ~~I mean~~
Bill: Certainly creating an opportunity for it.
Nokri (Marisa): if that's yer goal, keep in mind that any girls won't be going to a bar alone, they'll be in a pack or have male friends with them
Nokri (Marisa): though your role as host is beneficial in that it gives you a reason to talk to everybody
Andrew: There. Sold some weiss cards, mowed my lawn and paid a bill. All before work. Cant say i wasnt productive today.
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn
Andrew: Its either be productive or Ota dont happen.
Andrew: And I wanna be there with yall.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i finally got paid for some freelance work i did like 2 months ago today so i feel ya lol
Bill: Zeikani going to come to the new hope crawl. Facebook didn't notify me, that's cool.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LMAO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): All the comments are ‚Äúthis is Otakon I can‚Äôt go‚Äù
Aldus Larian (Jess): RIP
Nokri (Marisa): looool
Andrew: Yea lol i noticed thaty
Andrew: I thought she was going to Ota?
Andrew: Maybe not haha
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): sarah is literally singlehandedly crashing cosplay beach day into the ground
Nokri (Marisa): good thing alyssa has another one that's exactly the same at exactly the same location
Nokri (Marisa): that isn't during otakon
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Lmao damnn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Can we uhhhhh go to that one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O wait jk that‚Äôs the day I wanted birth
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cosplay beach day and celebrate later isn‚Äôt a bad idea though
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo i like this idea
Bill: or just. go to the beach.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but cosplay!
Bill: We don't *only* have to do cosplay events...!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _but cosplay_
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean we haven't been doing a ton lately
Aldus Larian (Jess): and its not like you cant go in cosplay cuz 90% of the people at the beach still wont be in cosplay since its a side event
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've been really lazy with any cosplay stuff lately
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which reminds me, gotta go clip a few feet of wire
Nokri (Marisa): *cosplay*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thank you marisa
Kaio Vermino (Lee): When is the other not Sarah beach day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): august 10th
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ooooo gotcha. Ye **cosplay**
Nokri (Marisa): i wanna wear rin again
Nokri (Marisa): i gotta start working out
Bill: Cosplay's all well and good. Just a shame sometimes cosplay is the only thing that can bring us together. Moot point.
Nokri (Marisa): i wanna do bnha but if i don't wear canon outfits no one will know who i am <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): why invisible?
Nokri (Marisa): i'll get to go off invisible soon! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): in a week if all goes well
Aldus Larian (Jess): its not tho, we get together for other things!
idk what ill wear but none of my swimsuits I use for cosplay are canon lol
Nokri (Marisa): because you good cosplayer <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): and so are uuuuu
Nokri (Marisa): i think i only have cosplay swimsuits i don't think i have a regular one so we gotta cosplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Aldus Larian (Jess): what cosplay swimsuits u has?
Nokri (Marisa): rin from love live, maki from love live, mari from evangelion, saber, i have some old pokemon ones from middle school but i think the elastic is shot, nowi is technically a bathing suit
Nokri (Marisa): cosplay swimsuits are also really cheap, like $5
Nokri (Marisa): when they're on sale
Nokri (Marisa): katara would also work for the beach but it's not a swimsuit
Nokri (Marisa): oh and that typical school uniform swimsuit i was gonna use for iida
Andrew: I'm down for a beach day. Dont think I'd be comfortable cosplaying a swimsuit lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ‚ú®  both ‚ú®
Nokri (Marisa): OH manaka would also be perfect for the beach, she literally lives in the ocean and comes to the surface for school

both, both is good
Andrew: Fun n sun n cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): my two favorites are the only ones i have pictures of so maybe i'd do another one if i go. depends on the weather
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo cute, but yea get some pics in one you dont have yet!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~How do i get invited to this event~~
Nokri (Marisa): gotta ask one of the hosts to send an invite. we can ask alyssa at otakon
Nokri (Marisa): i see her 900 times a con
Aldus Larian (Jess): whooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok, I feel less bad taking wire from work for LEDs because I'm using the generic stuff we get which is like $0.02/foot
Nokri (Marisa): I combined like 5 patterns together for Raphtalia when I had the perfect pattern for her all along <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): Actually wait no nvm. It‚Äôs not button up
Nokri (Marisa): We good
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): We were invited.last year <@351471675843411978>  I know
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): But by sarah
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's technically a different event tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I technically stole about $0.26 worth of wire
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nie
Nokri (Marisa): NOT NICE
Nokri (Marisa): THEFT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~*didn't Bojo literally just steal cookies from a party the other day?*~~
