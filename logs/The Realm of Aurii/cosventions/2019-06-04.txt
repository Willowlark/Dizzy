Aldus Larian (Jess): Y'all look great
N👌kri (Marisa): that's neat of the daria person
a lot of photoshoots get messed up last minute and the hosts bail. that's how i wound up running the sao meetup at otakon, a katsucon undertale meetup, and a dangan ronpa meet. then there are ones where the host didn't anticipate the turnout and who need help running it, like another undertale meet and a steven universe one i've been to
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Trying to figure out how to get Widow's wrist cuffs to light up. I'm looking into fairy lights but it's not going as easy as I thought it would
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oo yeah Marisa that worked
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Trying to look into working with LEDs and microcontrollers and it's stressing me out lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like I should be able to understand some of it but it's so confusing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's what I've been doing instead of work today
Kaio Vermino (Lee): the coding is the hard part definitely
Kaio Vermino (Lee): everything else seems to be pretty easy to learn with it in front of you, assembly, i mean
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm stressing about the hardware because I don't know what I should be getting
Kaio Vermino (Lee): adafruit is kinda helpful
Kaio Vermino (Lee): their website
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I checked it out already and it stressed me out more lmao
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oh RIP jk then xD
N👌kri (Marisa): Svetlanna has a good guide in one of her books, Anna has the book on a good drive. It’s got neat diagrams and explanations on using LEDs in cosplay
N👌kri (Marisa): If you dig around the BNE chat you might be able to find the link
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): trying to search...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you'd think that'd have been something we would have pinned
Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I watched Kamui's video on it and the one component she used now has a warning on the website that it's outdated and might not work with modern computers and I'm just like RIP
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): even though it gives alternatives I'm just like *will these work the same? which one do I get?*
N👌kri (Marisa): oooo then the book might be outdated too aahhhh
but the soldering info could be helpful?
Bill: That shirt or
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is so frustrating because I'm not a book learner. I need someone to show me exactly what to do and explain it to me so I can replicate it
Kaio Vermino (Lee): youtube?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll try again but they never explain the technical stuff
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <@!184437198865563648> i think the beer one is fitting for CCE
Kaio Vermino (Lee): also do you have the link to that wig you go for thor? becauseeeee it'd be perfect for captain marvel xD
Bill: Yee get it in a second.
Bill: Did you wear your armor to work. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ....if i could comfortably sit in it i might have
Bill: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FC7G9ML/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Kaio Vermino (Lee): BLESS thank
Bill: 
Bill: ~~30 fucking dollars *why*~~
N👌kri (Marisa): omg this is ridiculous
Whoever wrote the complaint wasn’t talking about mistakes. They were talking about stuff like “staff don’t get priority for anything and must be working while on duty,” and then having the head of the department boasting about how they went and cut in the autograph line to chat with a famous person and get free autographs while they were working.
N👌kri (Marisa): this email makes me so livid, the people in charge have no idea how messed up things are
N👌kri (Marisa): *because they're the ones messing it up*
N👌kri (Marisa): i've worked there for years and people don't remember me because i'm still on the very bottom of the ladder, which i'm fine with, but people are abusing their power to get autographs while i'm struggling to get past the new gopher who won't let me in the vicinity *where i'm stationed to work* because he doesn't believe that i'm staff *despite wearing a staff shirt and having a staff badge and a radio*. he didn't even have any of those things aaaaaaaaaaaaa it's so corrupt and messed up
Bill: :/
Bill: If you want to do the stuff at the con, don't staff.
N👌kri (Marisa): shoutout to tom for being recognized as staff more than i was <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Staff work the con, they don't 'attend'.
N👌kri (Marisa): i want to staff, it's just how messed up it's gotten. they dont follow their own rules and i get scolded for things i have 100% approval for, because i wanted to make sure they were ok to do because i thought i might get scolded.

we've worked there for so long and everyone else who's worked there as long has moved up, but we're content with our positions so we stay where we are. that leads to:
1.) people thinking we're new and bossing us around unfairly
2.) the people who *do* know us pushing blame onto us for things we didn't do
N👌kri (Marisa): like the whole friday line debacle
Bill: The whole thing is bullcrap.
Bill: You right.
Bill: They should be happy to have such reliable members on the staff, not disrespecting you for that.
N👌kri (Marisa): yeah. bojo intereacted with every single attendee at the con, since everyone goes to the dealers room at some point. she got one single complaint and the con board **shouted** at her without hearing her side of the story, asking for any witnesses, or investigating what really happened. they take credit for things we did and forget their promises.
Bill: That’s just wrong.
N👌kri (Marisa): lanie did say that the blind bags in the dealers room this year were dedicated to me and they only started selling them because of me though ;u;
Bill: Oh?
N👌kri (Marisa): the zenkai dealers table had blind bags for like $10 where you could get a ton of random merch. she said it's because when i worked in that department i'd always return from my breaks with like 20 random grab bags
N👌kri (Marisa): *and i actually got breaks there*
Bill: Oh I didn’t see those. Good on Lanie for appreciating Marisa.
N👌kri (Marisa): everyone hates lanie for some reason. i think it's because she's loud and she calls people out on their nonsense, but she gets things done. properly.
N👌kri (Marisa): and if she breaks the rules she makes sure everyone profits from it evenly
Bill: I like her already.
Bill: I see why you were upset by hunter pulling strings. It just added to the mess that was already there.
N👌kri (Marisa): YEAH
like i wouldn't care if it was an arrangement made long in advance, or if *every* meetup had the same opportunity, but that's exactly one example of staff breaking the rules. it wasn't a mistake or an accident
N👌kri (Marisa): kiwi was breaking the rules for a friend and that's not ok, it doesn't set a good example
N👌kri (Marisa): ~~also i would've worn blake that day if i knew because I was scheduled to work during that time but i had blake with me~~
N👌kri (Marisa): i'm glad that everyone was able to enjoy the rwby meetup despite my constant nagging and shouting, but there were so many other meetups that had to suffer outside.
and we've been telling the con for ***years*** they need a designated meetup space. they've promised they'd do it and then never did.
Bill: girl you weren't nagging at all.
N👌kri (Marisa): and i was telling kiwi my idea for the shoot and she brushed it off saying "you're not running the meetup you're just keeping it in check so don't do that" and i did it anyway because *without the tape and without putting the cosplayers in the hallway it would be a giant mess* and aertshdhteretshdjhrashtd it's so frustrating aaaaa i'm gonna sew stuff to my leg
Bill: I'm glad you were assigned to it, I wasn't worried about you stepping on my toes in make decisions. You'd told me what I can and can't do and trusted I wouldn't try and pull a fast one on you.
N👌kri (Marisa): i nagged and bossed everyone around sorry
Bill: Literally you did nothing of the sort.
N👌kri (Marisa): but also i did
Bill: who, cause I was running the shoot and you were like. Barely there.
Bill: Just keeping people out of the walkway.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you did good job mawisa!
Bill: ye, 10/10 would have Marisa again as staff liason
N👌kri (Marisa): I kept telling the photographer group to move over or move up, and asking the cosplayers to move closer to the wall. Rebecca can attest I yelled at them like 50 times
Bill: Both things I would have said if I spotted it.
Bill: so.
Bill: I guess I'm naggy and bossy too if you are. :3c
Aldus Larian (Jess): i doubt you "yelled at them"
Bill: Marisa: I yelled at them
Bill: 
Bill: <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
N👌kri (Marisa): I don’t think Im physically able to yell but I shouted as best I could owo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Fuck it. just gonna buy what I think I'll need from Adafruit and hope for the best. It'll be an experiment. An expensive one.
N👌kri (Marisa): Science
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOO u can do it erik!
Bill: so when you say Ada fruit, does that mean ada language?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: well. It looks like Adafruit runs off python.
Bill: 
Bill: https://learn.adafruit.com/capacitive-touch-unicorn-horn which is the microcontroller for this, which is I guess similar?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): RIP since I'm buying lithium ion batteries I had to pay for UPS shipping
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hopefully I don't have the same issue that my dad did where they needed a signature and kept trying to delivery it when no one was home despite my dad calling them after every delivery attempt trying to get them to delivery it without a signature
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh wait, I think it was FedEx
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m 15 minutes late with Dunkin’ but do you want me to ask Noah?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He squats in the electronics shop at Rutgers all the time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He might have a helpful suggestion or two
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll fuck around on my own for now and if I get stuck I'll keep him in mind
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Thanks!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No prob!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah still doesn’t “understand” cosplay but I remember at geek week he was like “I thought that Yang might beat you” and I was like “oh no that cosplay is bought”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he talked to her later and she was like “oh yeah I bought this”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he was like WHAT ARE YOUR MYSTICAL POWERS OF COSPLAY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So he still thinks cosplay is weird but he wants to 3D print and code and put electronics in everything
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i love when normies learn about cosplay and theyre like scared but intrigued
Kaio Vermino (Lee): how innocent
Aldus Larian (Jess): ME trying to color code my packing lists every. damn. time. : "oh half these characters theme color is pink"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): FUCK I NEED A PACK LIST
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This con snuck up on me my dudes
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i gotta do laundry tonight and attempt to start getting ym sht together
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll make a pack list......... tomorrow

Bill: 12:30 for MM, 6:00 for Zeikani.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I stopped Gwen because at this point I just don’t have the money
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So Sunday I’m gonna do the beat up Ochako from when she fought Bakugo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): All I have is toga at 10 right now I believe
N👌kri (Marisa): I’m considering Dani for Sunday because ez cosplay to do for chill day
N👌kri (Marisa): I think I’m 50/50 Dani and Yona because I have some missing pieces to find for Yona
Bill: Yes Georgia.
Bill: Ooooh Dani. We shoot.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im thinking maybe
Saeran/MC
Hiyori/Nora
and like crop top/rave 2b in there id f i do the rave
maybe?
Bill: You want to double on both days?
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk thats why its a maybe lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk if i wann be in Nora from morning until we leave tho
Bill: Mm... would you still come to the group shoot?
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk when is it?
Bill: 2.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hdnt even thought of that honestly XD
Bill: I have golden hour timing still for Friday, if you want to do MC and whatever Tom is doing. Also not doing formal, so we could pool shoot in the evening or I’d be down to rave Friday if you want to go.
Bill: Since you can’t sat. 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): then maybe i just keep just nora for saturday
tom is staying in unknown all day friday, im just switching too MC when marisa switched out of ray
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea rave or pool would be neat i think pool closes at like 9 ish? i still need bathing suit 2b pics
Aldus Larian (Jess): 10pm pool closes
Bill: Last shoot is 5-6 with Kirsten, I don’t want to rush from there so 6:30~7ish?
Bill: I doubt the outdoor light matters for that, so if you want some Mc unknown that’d be cool too.
Bill: “That” being pool shooting.
Aldus Larian (Jess): *put tom outside the window on the 14th floor for a photoshoot*
Bill: Yes.
Bill: ~~put Marisa out the window as you walk out of the building~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok yea well see what happens im formal planning shoot with marisa and tom for friday  and you and tom for saturday, everything else is kinda up in the air. im not feeling the formal cuz like wedding on sunday
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom prob gonna do tekken tournament on saturday?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok so looking at the alternate microcontroller and rewatching Kamui's video, looks like it has the same basic connections
Bill: Oh nice.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im prob gonna formal with rei friday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and im game to rave saturday
Bill: Formal with Marisa too.
Andrew: Incoming costest later tonight with complete naofumi
Andrew: Also am dead rn closed store last night and had to come in at 10am
N👌kri (Marisa): i can't find anything aaaaa
so much stuff got moved around while i was in japan that i can find like 95% of a costume but not all of it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MAWISA WE DANCE?
N👌kri (Marisa): i can't find my ranma wig so i'll have to braid raven's wig, which kind of stinks because my ranma wig has the gravity defying pigtail. i also can't find ranma's pants so i guess i'm just doing them for the formal.
i think i could pull off morgiana and/or chise instead of regular ranma? i think i have stuff for them?
N👌kri (Marisa): I CAN ATTEMPT TO DANCE
N👌kri (Marisa): i was gonna do manaka or chiaki but can't find a proper wig for either of them. mari's tie is missing, sinon's scarf is missing, i think i could do candy maid nozomi? elsie's hairpiece, katara's bracelets, nia's wig, ranka's tights, oh wait nozomi doesn't have gloves so there goes that idea too. hmmmm.
Aldus Larian (Jess): we need to get you a storage unit
Bill: two storage units most likely.
N👌kri (Marisa): i could do natsumi but i cant find my keroro doll and i wouldn't be recognizable without it because natsumi's too simple
Aldus Larian (Jess): ir like at least a bunch of labeled boxes and space in my basement
N👌kri (Marisa): i didn't finish kagura's backpack rip
N👌kri (Marisa): we have labelled boxes!!
N👌kri (Marisa): they fail spectacularly!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no!
N👌kri (Marisa): yeah the parts of yona i can find were in 4 different boxes
Aldus Larian (Jess): what else do you still need for yona?
N👌kri (Marisa): the overshirt and the earrings
they're the easiest parts and i can remake them both in like an hour but i don't have the supplies for the shirt. i wanted to remake ao anyway.
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe you could borrow from georgia if she has them?
N👌kri (Marisa): nooo that'd be so messed up, georgia hasn't debuted her outfit yet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont have earrings i am gomen
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i have the overshirt tho!

N👌kri (Marisa): i wonder if there's any bit of the original collar i can transplant <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Kaio Vermino (Lee): ~~pack it for her~~

N👌kri (Marisa): NOOO!!!! georgia hasn't worn her yona yet!!! is unfair!!
N👌kri (Marisa): what if i wear it and i trip into a puddle of fabric stainer and it's ruined forever. boom. instant eternal disgrace.
N👌kri (Marisa): animenext has that giant vat of permanent fabric dye right in the middle of the floor
Aldus Larian (Jess): in order to get into the room you must bring mawisa one piece of cosplay
N👌kri (Marisa): time for me to drop out of the room and live under the boardwalk for the weekend

Aldus Larian (Jess): that also sounds terrible
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Her idea is terrible

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): stephen is too nice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he would do it if she asked
