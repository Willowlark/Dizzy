Bill: Found out this is a thing.
Bill: I can sorta spiky muss my hair in a Claude like way. Which is good, cause finding out about the group yesterday made me realize thereâ€™s going to be a lot of Claude cosplayers and most are going to look better than me. ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): I wanna join but I also wanna make the costume weirdly detailed so I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll get the supplies for it in time
Nokri (Marisa): A bit of makeup and you can be best Claude!
Bill: Def take your time then.
Nokri (Marisa): Still not entirely sure whatâ€™s going on with eddieâ€™s uniform. Some kind of long sleeved bolero over a romper? Fire emblem is usually good for reference images though so maybe thereâ€™s an art book somewhere that explains exactly whatâ€™s going on
Nokri (Marisa): The only issue with Bernie on the other hand is the design on the back of her shirt thatâ€™s covered up by the hoodie. It seems simple but other students have a more complex design, but itâ€™s hard to tell which it could be because each student kind of has a different design on the back of their shirt if itâ€™s visible
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YALL I had a dream Katsucon banned people from shooting outside
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was wild chaos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like an angry mob
Bill: Are you planning to do Edelgard too?
Nokri (Marisa): o i thought that was part of the deal
Bill: You only have to cosplay who you like silly.
Bill: Which I expect is Bernie.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~everyone at katsu run to the gazebo~~
bernie for president
Bill: ~~already shared that meme~~
Nokri (Marisa): it's not a meme it's reality
Bill: Ah yes, when we release the waifus from area 51 Bernadetta can become president.
Bill: Aww. Mark wants me to do photography for his family. Family portraits for Christmas cards and stuff.
Nokri (Marisa): you've already done taht [slides him the schnee pictures]
Bill: No his normie family lol. Well, his normie wife. Son dabbles in nerd and Audrey is Audrey.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Have to return the wig... didn't realize it said "gray"
Andrew: I gotta start Dimitri soon
