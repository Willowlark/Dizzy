Nokri (Marisa): Omg the badge pickup line looks absolutely insane. Does it move fast? Did you guys get badges yet
Bill: Tom Jess Kurtis and I did. The lines actually for late swim tickets, and you can do pre reg in the line
Nokri (Marisa): orly? People were posting images of it and it looked super long. Tricky perspective. Unless it actually is long
Bill: Long for CCE anyway
Nokri (Marisa): How long did it take?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol like 15 mins
Nokri (Marisa): OH phew so that means tomorrow shouldn’t be over an hour
Biru was saying long for CCE and I was thinking “so... 1 hour? 90 minutes?”
Bill: I can’t sleep past 7 anymore and it suckkkkksssss
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I woke up naturally at 6, went back to sleep, then woke up at 7:47, then went back to sleep until my alarm went off at 8 to the sultry sounds of Africa by Toto
Bill: As much as I like using the shower and mirrors before everyone else so I’m not in the way, I don’t need to be up two hours before everyone else stirs lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  I found the boi at the waterfall
