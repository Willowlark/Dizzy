秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): doujin events are really inspiring and really drive me to try and make my own stuff. resolution for 2019 is learn how 2 draw and make another comic for once.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i got a lot of really nifty ideas from this weekend, and picked up a few useful books (the most expensive of which was $5 gosh i love japan's book prices). BoJo and I have been considering running an artist alley booth when she retires from staffing ~~we'd only ever have a chance at zenkai though because artist alleys are SO competitive and selective. far moreso than con hotel rooms.~~ We've come up with a good list of merchandise, but nothing that's really unique among what you'd find at conventions. But I have some awesome ideas after this week.

I have to check the rules for various artist alleys since they've changed and I don't know if some of the things I'm thinking of are legal to sell at US cons due to copyright laws. *Buuuut* if they are legal, I wouldn't be able to create certain aspects alone and I would split any sales profits with everyone who helped to create it. anyone at all who would want to help. nudge. nudge wink.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Cosplay prints are legal to sell at certain conventions with all the proper copyright, right? So at those cons what I’m thinking of wouldn’t be an issue. There are even loopholes to get around that.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): The problem would then be if there’s a market 🤔
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Hey that sounds neet tho! 👌
