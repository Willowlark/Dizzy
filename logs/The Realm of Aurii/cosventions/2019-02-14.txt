Bill: That very true.
Bill: Artist’s angst.

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yees
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We're gonna give everythingwe don't need to Dave to bring home so we should be ok on the way home
Bill: Yooooou could drop a car at my house when you head out with Daaaave.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's the opposite direction
Bill: Soooo is another 40 minutes round trip to you after the 5 hours home. It’s just a suggestion. (Also it shouldn’t be, you’ll likely be going down 206 which takes you past me)
N🆗ri (Marisa): I haven’t started packing yet but i should have one suitcase, one violin case, maybe a backpack and a dress bag
Bill: 👌 I’m just curious cause I remember you once said you use bins to transport stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!! OwO that’s tru sometimes
Bill: Way more people are crunching down to the wire than I thought... maybe it’s part of Katsu’s culture or something but it’s not. Really a good thing.

N🆗ri (Marisa): uhh im really sorry
my cat got sick about an hour ago on my bed, where stuff was laid out. it wasn't pretty. some costume pieces got messed up, namely ray's jacket. i tried rinsing it out but it was nasty. i was able to remake it with the remaining fabric i have except it absolutely sucks because i made it in a half hour. so i will have ray, but it looks really bad. im sorry 😭
