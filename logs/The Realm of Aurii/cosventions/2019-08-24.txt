Bill: Oh.
Bill: Oh thatâ€™s why uncle yo shared it.
Bill: Heâ€™s uh.
Bill: In it.
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/events/504780270065483/?ti=icl thereâ€™s another game night cosplay thing in Morristown too.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oh nice
Bill: 
Bill: Jannetinscosplay
Bill: Iâ€™m? On board?
Bill: Anger Bakugo but cute uraraka is strange but good.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jannetincosplay does really great work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): As much as we shouldn't do "canon cosplayers" she's canon Widowmaker
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O thatâ€™s the really good Momo!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): if i go to the smithville mansion shoot, i might also be able to go to the shoot the same day in philly because one ends at noon and the other starts at 3 <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Nokri (Marisa): oh it's a picnic though. while that sounds fun, i wouldn't be able to keep fresh food in the car that long so maybe i shouldn't go.
Nokri (Marisa): biru/andru are you going? you guys are on the event page
Bill: I donâ€™t remember the details, donâ€™t plan on going atm
Bill: You talking Smithville or the other thing?
Bill: Iâ€™m salty at that groups photographer rules, so Iâ€™m not likely to go to any. I think theyâ€™re unfair.
Bill: The other thing is in phili iirc? thatâ€™s a pain to get to for a day event, so probably not. Sowwy.
Nokri (Marisa): what's the other thing?
Nokri (Marisa): oo yeah, i was talking about both
Nokri (Marisa): smithville and the philly one
Nokri (Marisa): they're at different times so it's possible to go to both, but the philly one is a picnic and i'm leaning towards not going because i wouldn't be able to keep food fresh in the hot car
Aldus Larian (Jess): you could bring like chips or something that doesn't need to be kept cold!x
Nokri (Marisa): but warm chips <:woah:543194447345876998>
and that's so low effort, other people are bringing pigs in a blanket and cakes and stuff. then i roll up with uncooked dollar store food like "hey gaiz!" they'd hate me on the spot ;u;
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah!
Nokri (Marisa): *they'll cook me*
Bill: Go if you want to.
Nokri (Marisa): ? yeah?
but they'll hate me that's why i'm leaning against it
Bill: I have acquired product acquired to actually get Claude texture to hair <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: They wonâ€™t hate you.
