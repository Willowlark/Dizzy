Bill: How am I gaining followers. I stopped posting posts two weeks ago.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We are too, I'm assuming friend tags
Bill: Haven’t been tagged in much, cept today with all the Chestnut hill.
Bill: Weird.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Either that or bots?
Bill: Nah, the ones I’ve looked at are cosplayers.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Dunno then
Total Nok-out (Marisa): The call of the void. I post and get tagged and lose followers so doing nothing will lead you to fame and fortune.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Accounts that have been inactive for years get the most fame, I have an unused side tumblr with 1,000 more followers than my main that still gets asks regularly
Total Nok-out (Marisa): JESS IS UR PLEATING OK
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No lmao. I messed it up that were really unless even so I took the out and I'mma retry probably tomorrow
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Oh nooooooo
Total Nok-out (Marisa): 😭
Total Nok-out (Marisa): fight the pleats
Total Nok-out (Marisa): I like seeing the general progression of people giving up when you post too much to a story. Like it starts with a whopping 31 and about 4 posts in drops to 29 and by the end it’s at like 16. It’s like a real life horror movie and they’re slowly being killed off.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): How did the pleats become uneven that’s also a horror movie
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's why I don't even check to see who veiwed the story cuz I know I'll get to self conscious 😂
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): umm kinda just winged it? And I didn't follow any directions or anything 😂
Total Nok-out (Marisa): *pick off the weak story readers*
YOLO pleating. Good.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Normally I'd get frustrated but I didn't give it my best to begin with so I can't be too dissapointed
Total Nok-out (Marisa): That’s the spirit!
Total Nok-out (Marisa): It looks like maybe it was sewn too fast? Or the fabric got unfolded and misaligned when the pins were removed because the pins probably can’t be sewn over right
If it happens again maybe try uhhhh what’s the word. Not basting. I think. Like, sewing a super thin temporary stitch to hold everything in place that gets ripped out after you actually sew it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I didn't baste is ~~cuz idk how~~ I think I sewed it on the wrong side? Cuz the on the inside it looked ok but on the outside it looked like in my story 😵
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Learning experiences are fun
Total Nok-out (Marisa): OH NO 🙀
Is there any way you can make the inside the outside
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Na it too late now I ripped it all out
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Solemnly rest in pieces
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What is a fan sign?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): What
Total Nok-out (Marisa): No idea. Maybe like when you cosplay and write a sign with their url on it?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oof that's weird
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Yeah
Total Nok-out (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Big oofs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also this guy replys to my story alot but I can't read it
Total Nok-out (Marisa): [writes a sign in cosplay] no I won’t do a fan sign
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Oh my
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm pretty sure it's Arabic?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): First one says hello, second one says “his sweetness is ruined”
????
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): O boy ok
Total Nok-out (Marisa): *ominous*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Pretty sure the only thing on my story that day was me in the base for my mina suit
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Maybe google translate failed me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The person who asked for a fan sign doesn't even follow me
Total Nok-out (Marisa): OMG
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So that's a no ~~it was a no anyway but like wtf~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): so you’re totally gonna do it right
Total Nok-out (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye Totally
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Which is a bigger power move, ignoring or doing something to intentionally spite them
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Because if you spite them it sends a message but also shows they got under your skin
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'mma ignore them <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Total Nok-out (Marisa): If you ignore they might not realize anything but it shows they’re low
Total Nok-out (Marisa): 👍
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): As far as Arabic dude goes.... Uhhh idk what that means and idk if I wanna know
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Message back in Korean
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Speaking of
I should see if there are any new chats
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): There's another message where he mentions being sweet too??? Wtfff
Total Nok-out (Marisa): I don’t think so I get the same chats
ew what
That’s really strange
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Maybe he’s saying “sweet cosplay it looks totally gnarly bro”
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The first one is on a day I was posting lots if p C's of me and Tom? So maybe it's more like "that's sweet" ~~god I hope so~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Maybe he likes tom
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wouldn't be the first time
Total Nok-out (Marisa): *what
Story time pls*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): There's a guy that replysnto mine and Georgias stories when Tom is in them and compliments him dn also replys to Tom's story's to compliy him
Total Nok-out (Marisa): now we gotta form a tom protection squad
lets just invest in a security fence for everyone in aurii
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i better hear back from zenkaikon soon because the 3rd staff announcement just passed and they haven't given me a position yet and they keep losing my application, apparently.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧
Total Nok-out (Marisa): GOOD EMOJI
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh noooo! 😭 Zenkai plz
Total Nok-out (Marisa): fresh emoji
Total Nok-out (Marisa): YEAH this has never happened before
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭 wthhhh
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i sent in my application in august. during the second round of admissions i finally heard that they were sending my app to my second choice of department. asked lizzy why i wasn't put on cosplay and she said they never received my app.
both lizzy and BoJo then spoke with the head of security to make sure I get on there and SHE said she didn't get my app either. i'm going to fight someone.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭 where is you application why can't they find it
Total Nok-out (Marisa): seriously!!!! it's electronic! it's a form on their website!
and how come i got an e-mail saying my app was going to be moved to another department when it never reached either department at all
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🤔
Total Nok-out (Marisa): conspiracy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): For real.
Elfriede of commitment?: That really odd 🤔
Elfriede of commitment?: Maybe it's auto rejecting it cuz it's coming from Japan? Idk just trying to think of ideas
Total Nok-out (Marisa): purrhaps? but there was no issue submitting it in the first place and this didn't happen in 2016 when i also applied from japan. hmmmMMm.
Elfriede of commitment?: Hmmmmmmm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lmao im going through bills pics and i totally forgot about this gem:
