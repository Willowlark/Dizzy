No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): I don‚Äôt get photographers who say ‚Äúpm for rates.‚Äù Why they do that. I get from a business viewpoint it gets more interaction with their page? But also probably costs them more clients.
Bill: Probably let‚Äôs them be more selective of what they shoot?
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): that makes sense but then they also comment on people's lineups. people will be like "here's what I'm cosplaying! tell me who wants to shoot with me and your asking price!" and people will be like "i wanna shoot this costume, pm me for rates"
