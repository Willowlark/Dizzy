Bill: So I knew Zeikani had a falling out with the shoot runner for Anext overwatch right? She found screenshot convos of why, a lot of it revolved around this girl was using Zeikani for photos. Demanding more photos out of a free shoot, printing things without asking for print right (that Zeikani typically gives anyone who asks)...
Bill: I see why Zeikani hates the girl.
Bill: Like, Zeikani was the one being civil and this girl blew up with insults at her questions.

N🆗ri (Marisa): Blindfold wearing photographer 2B would be really funny
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its more the heels XD and i have 2 shoots
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pew pew!
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m so sick of this it won’t smooth out no matter what I do. The paint always gets bumpy and cracks.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it looks good though!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it doesnt looks craked in pic
N🆗ri (Marisa): Look there
Hideous
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats barely noticeable!
Bill: I don't even see anything.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone’s gonna come up and be like “ur headpiece is cracked”
N🆗ri (Marisa): You know what
Most criticisms I’ve gotten on costumes have been at Kotoricon
Why people at Kotori so judgey
N🆗ri (Marisa): Blake tights girl this year and then Ruby cape girl a few years back. Harsh.
Bill: No one will say that, because the only reason you think there's a problem is you have artist's OCD.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Everything I create is hideous and it shall be torn asunder in a massive roast the instant I step out of the hotel room
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: yeah, that's just artist's ocd.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Who insulted you? I'mma fight em
N🆗ri (Marisa): There was a random girl lol biru was there
She was asking about my Blake costume and complemented the tights being gradient and asked “did you dye them yourself?” And I said “no I actually bought the costume” and she went “oh” and just walked away lol

The ruby girl said I should remake my cape and was telling me how to hem an edge. I know how to hem an edge, I just didn’t bother on the bottom of the cape because it was the end of the fabric roll so it wasn’t a raw edge and it was gonna be by the ground anyway
Bill: I think she walked away cause it was awkward she was wrong.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *but what if she judgin’*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Time to fight
Bill: then she's a little cuck and not worth caring about.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Weather someone bought something or made it just say "it looks really good!'
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like shit is not hard
N🆗ri (Marisa): If it was awkward yeah she could’ve just been like “oh neat” and *then* walked away
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): People cray
N🆗ri (Marisa): Time to teach biru the passive aggressive ways of women
N🆗ri (Marisa): Lesson one; the sigh
N🆗ri (Marisa): *oh no he’s gone red*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~He been red~~
Bill: EEEEEYUUPPPPP
Bill: (It's not because of you Marisa, don't think it for the secon)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~wats wrong biru~~
Bill: I'm good.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😒  sounds fake but ok
Bill: As it happens, I don't have to air out *all* my problems publicly. Not only because I have to *want* to share, but sometimes I don't even know what to share.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): k, osrry
Bill: Good of you to ask though.
Bill: That's appreciated.
Bill: You know I'd share if I wanted to, so if I say "I'm good" it's because I don't want to, not to be fake or hide it from you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The gameboy sewing machine was far ahead of its time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hey dudes is this color close enough to the body paint color for me to get away with not painting my legs for PJ Mina?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ehhhh not really but also fuck it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): People wear tights with shorts all the time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yeaaaa like if it was for something more serious i might buy a new color or paint my legs but like I don't really wanna paint my legs at 11pm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Or spend anymore money 💸
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Maybe she just got sunburn on her legs or something
