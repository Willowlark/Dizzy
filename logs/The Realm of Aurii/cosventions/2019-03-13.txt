Bill: The nights at Zenkai are really busy so I’d like to just sit with the schedule and figure it what everyone’s doing so we can do whatever together we want.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo yea i remember it being discussed but i dont remeber where
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omfg I didn’t even know Justin was actually considering coming either ahhhhh this is a mess
Aldus Larian (Jess): well dont stress about it. Im sorry i didnt mean to stress you out 😦
Bill: It’s such a mess lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like now I wish I could’ve coordinated with Justin
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I have star guardian
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hdsufhsidjsj
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I h8 con
Bill: That’s on Justin though, he didn’t let you know.
Bill: Hell, first I saw was a story like yesterday iirc.
Bill: I think.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah but it makes me wanna jump star guardian to Sunday especially cause I don’t have time or willpower to finish Yona
N🆗ri (Marisa): has anyone heard anything about rowancon since it was announced
Bill: We’ll lose the light writing part of the shoot... but that was being rushed by the chili’s trip too. Maybe it’s for the best to Sunday shift.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Justin’s wearing a likely Bakugo so i could wear todo if i wanted
N🆗ri (Marisa): dani. terra. emma. maid blake. those are my cosplays for the first half the con. i don't know what i'm wearing saturday night and sunday. <:thinku:543194478614413318> OH no wait sunday was gonna be pokemon trainer if the stuff come out decent, or something else real easy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I will be todoHOki for the rave now I guess lol
Bill: Are you switching then?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah the revised line up would make me happier
Bill: =/ I don’t like that the booked shoot is just getting tossed out... I don’t think that’s fair to me. But ever since chili’s came up I knew that shoot was going to end up rushed anyway.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m sorry
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Honestly knowing justin is coming and not wanting to do Yona really pushed star guardian out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I could’ve stayed in it but I know I would’ve been miserable
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's no staff con stories panel nooooo
i may just go to panels each night
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!245270932602486784>  what your friday plans Star and casual star? do u wave another change in there?
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait wasn't friday titans
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean starfire
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Friday is Starfire, and casual Starfire, and some formal ball thing later
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it not being done anymore
oooo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Saturday is Yang and Fem Todo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sunday is Star Guardians Lux
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao Starfire, star guardian, and star are all cosplays I do
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea! that why i needed to clarify XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok im in for raven and casual raven, IDK if we doing ball yet
Aldus Larian (Jess): if u wanna change out earlier ill prob do hiyori with tom but i had plans with u first
N🆗ri (Marisa): would anyone like to do cookie roulette
it wouldn't take but 5 minutes of time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll prob do Starfire the whole time basically
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or until the body paint bugs me
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok sounds good
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa are u going to the ball?
N🆗ri (Marisa): probably not
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i do i'd be late
Aldus Larian (Jess): i def wanna block out some time for cookies
N🆗ri (Marisa): my cookies expire in april and i don't want them to go bad but i don't have any friends to share them with pls eat them ;u;
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like Zenkai is gonna be shitty ahhh
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz i felt bad we didnt get to do it at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Marisa I’ll have cookie
N🆗ri (Marisa): busycon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s not even busy con it’s just like... plans can’t come together
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And it’s giving me massive anxiety
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like no cons are supposed to be fun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I’m worried about this all now
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah cons have gotten sucky recently
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like I let you and bill down by cancelling Yona and bumping lux
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I don’t have the time to finish Yona, I don’t wanna cosplay her alone, and that goes double because it was a cosplay I was originally only doing for Hal
Aldus Larian (Jess): we can all do yona together another time! and Marisa wont be working
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Bill was really excited about the light writing thing but Justin only goes to like three cons a year and there’s a chance I won’t even be at Anext
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not to mention there’s a time that Justin and I didn’t talk because of personal problems so I really cherish his presence when I can get it
Aldus Larian (Jess): we wait for u! we can do private shoot too
N🆗ri (Marisa): is ok as long as someday i get to see yona 👌 
i wouldn't of been able to see her anyway unless it was for just a minute, or at night
N🆗ri (Marisa): assuming my work
wow my internet died there
assuming my work schedule doesn't change around.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hopefully
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah it’s just got me all bummed
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the formal is gonna be a crapshoot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t really care for raves and bonus Hal is definitely gonna be there
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa can u post your schedule one more time adn <@!184437198865563648>  can u pin it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): from what i've been told, i work the hours the dealers room is open, and maybe a little before and after that. we have 15 minute shifts and then we swap locations. so 15 minutes at the front door, 15 minutes at the front door, back again, and then sometimes we'll get to patrol the dealers hall if there's a lot of poeple working
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel like i've hung out with most members of aurii for less than 3 hours collectively since it was formed
Aldus Larian (Jess): D: nah  we hung out for like 8 hrs on sunday at zenkai!
Aldus Larian (Jess): but still need more! what panels were you thinking of goin to?
N🆗ri (Marisa): one of todd's panels, maybe amv showdown, the corgi cosplay pj party ~~i wonder if she remembers our currency exchange~~
folklore of pennsylvania seems really interesting but idk if i can make it. maybe the 18+ dating game because i used to help run it. and i wanna go to the shinto panel on sunday but that's 99% unable to go
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo neato! depending on times i might come along? the 18+ dating game would prob be entertaining
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was ok. we had a gordon ramsay cosplayer one year who was lit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG
N🆗ri (Marisa): i forget who he ended up with. i wanna say it was, like, one of the ace attorney chNO NO IT WAS ACE it was ace from one piece wew
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> apology accepted.
N🆗ri (Marisa): who goin to kogara

Bill: It free.
Aldus Larian (Jess): in april?

Bill: The Saturday before Sakura Sunday. I say we make a weekend of it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH sakura sunday is a thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): ya as long as tom is in i go
N🆗ri (Marisa): it is  the day before sakura sunday <:thinku:543194478614413318> i wanna buy tickets to that but i fear rain

Aldus Larian (Jess): we steal
Aldus Larian (Jess): i kinda like smol cons
Aldus Larian (Jess): i talk to more people i feel
Bill: Yeah I like the day cons.
N🆗ri (Marisa): less happening i feel

N🆗ri (Marisa): i haven't heard anything about it
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i feels bad
Bill: Yeee. Zeikani marked interested.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo hopefully she go then?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i would of gone if it want zenkon
Bill: Me too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can do kogara/sakura slumber party if it's a thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): but i worry about rain
N🆗ri (Marisa): i worry about everything but primarily rain
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats what killed it lastyear
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@245270932602486784> just do what you enjoy, like you said, cons are supposed to be fun, you can't please everyone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah you’re right 😞
Bill: Worth the risk of rain for slumber party.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You ain't paying a bunch of money to just be stressed 🙏
Aldus Larian (Jess): truth
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Late, but I too would like to block off time for cookies <@301927856240459777>
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH we need either 6 or 12 people
N🆗ri (Marisa): anything in between and we'll need some kind of game to decide who gets the others
Aldus Larian (Jess): double roulette
Bill: ~~how does one find good wog on amazon~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): there is no method
N🆗ri (Marisa): read reviews
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that
N🆗ri (Marisa): mapofbeauty generally runs small so i hear. it fits me fine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they also the biggest seller on amazon tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): they fucked up my nejire wig <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): how? :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was 2 shades of blue XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***three?***
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
it was white, light blue and dark blue
Aldus Larian (Jess): it was a beautiful wig but not what i needed
Bill: Do I need to look for one with a part like his or? Does generic anime boy fluff translate to V with hair spray.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t think you’ll find a wig with a part like his, that’ll have to be done by hand
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless you buy from the mystic messenger ones they have like on ebay
Bill: I don’t think it’d get them in time, otherwise I could just use ezcosplag.
Bill: Ye....
Aldus Larian (Jess): depends on the shipper with ebaybutya
N🆗ri (Marisa): eBay x Amazon otp
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg XD
Bill: Well styling amazon wig sound hard so.
Bill: Will flip through eBay in morning. If I can find something worth the risk I’ll order there otherwise just do ez and borrow?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i guess? ive never gotten a wig from there but you've had good experiences with them
Bill: I don’t remember which Mirio wig is the good one actually.
Bill: Oops.
Bill: They came on the same day and I haven’t worn them yet.
Aldus Larian (Jess): like these are cheap and prestyled 
https://www.ebay.com/i/322928846893?rt=nc&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D20160908110712%26meid%3D40c7ab4d3d5548438cbebffdade92880%26pid%3D100677%26rk%3D10%26rkt%3D30%26sd%3D182951623364%26itm%3D322928846893
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think thats what like every v cosplayer ive seen has
Bill: I could do that then... probably won’t make it for Zenkai.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i know alot of sellers carry them so look around i guess?
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe one day ill figure out what color sevens hair is and order a new wig
Bill: eBay won’t let me checkout so I can’t see if there’s expedited shipping.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: https://www.ebay.com/itm/Game-Mystic-Messenger-Cosplay-Wig-Jumin-han-Zen-Luciel-707-Jaehee-kang-V-Searan/202313642094?var=502288440154&hash=item2f1ad5306e:m:mqF5DqFImcecFu_nOhN5ZkA&frcectupt=true good seller, might make it before Zenkai?
N🆗ri (Marisa): imagine someone running cross country desperately trying to deliver your wig before zenkai
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🏃
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): why is V's name Visitor?
Aldus Larian (Jess): im dying XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): its one letter people, how did u get that wrong
N🆗ri (Marisa): *Visitor*
so mysterious
Aldus Larian (Jess): ah yes my fav mobile game: Mysterious Visitor
Bill: Ordered that one.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoo!
Aldus Larian (Jess): visitor in the way
N🆗ri (Marisa): **Visitor en route.**
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh shit, only one Jumin left...
N🆗ri (Marisa): destiny calls
Aldus Larian (Jess): you should be able to get them from other sellers too?
N🆗ri (Marisa): only one left in the world
Aldus Larian (Jess): there can be only one
Bill: There's stuff you can do to stretch a sweater but I think I'm leaning pinning it for the little bit of stretch.
Bill: Just in case the process thing doesn't go well.
Aldus Larian (Jess): do what I do and stand on the ends and then pull
Aldus Larian (Jess): terrible idea really but hey
Bill: Also an option but.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do i track down people who proposed at cons to send them pics
N🆗ri (Marisa): [tries to snipe proposal pics and just gets a blur]
i have so many katsu proposal pics tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Post them on the con event pages or groups?
Bill: ye.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And be like "hey if anyone knows this couple, please tag them" or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): here are a list of couples pls help me hunt them down
Bill: When did dealers open friday Marisa?
N🆗ri (Marisa): of katsu?
Bill: Zenkai.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 2pm, 3pm for the public but 2pm for vip
Bill: but when did you have to start working it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): my schedule says 1
Bill: So we could do boudoir in the morning instead of late thursday depending on exhaustion.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo
can do that. what time is the titans shoot?
Bill: Wait now I'm remembering, weren't we going to do like, early shooting?
Bill: Like 9 or 10am?
Bill: Titans is 11 but I think we can flex that around a bit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i need to change for my shift and get a radio beforehand so i can stay in terra until maybe 12:15
N🆗ri (Marisa): unless i can work later/closer to the dealer's opening
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're being very difficult with staff scheduling this year
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh Titans is 11? Fuck ok
Bill: wait what did you think it was?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I didn't knoe
Bill: I have 11.
N🆗ri (Marisa): whatchu got for 11 jess
Bill: I mean, we can do anytime Mawisa isn't working.
Aldus Larian (Jess): When you guys planned it I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to do it yet
Aldus Larian (Jess): Umm I should be able to do 11
Bill: why are these lewd shoots so hard to plan?
Bill: Makes sense to not do renora, if you are, at that time cause you gotta body paint. Could do it later in the day since Marisa isn't needed (but always wanted).
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz they scary
Bill: Cause we have to be in the room I guess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think because they're always planned so late and by that time everyone is tired
N🆗ri (Marisa): like it fell through thursday because i was tired oops and then sunday because everyone was tired
Bill: so <@!301927856240459777> <@!334090409389195266> Beedoir either thursday night if we're all there and awake or 9:30~10am on Friday. Cool?
N🆗ri (Marisa): is cool. thursday night i won't be able to until like 11pm but can do friday also.
Bill: is anyone else confirmed wanting to do something in hotel with lights? <@!386874959009415170> <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> ?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have the slightest slivers of planning just forming so no
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotta see how my hotel room situation is too, if they keep it as-is or if they add more people to our room because if the latter i can't stay out too late and wake people up by coming in late
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't have any plans for bedroom shoots
Bill: Need some heads up for this cause room, but I'm game if you are.
N🆗ri (Marisa): you know what'd make a great bedroom cosplay. suyaris.
Bill: kk @all.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): every chapter is about her finding new ways to get a better sleep
N🆗ri (Marisa): hashtag goals
Aldus Larian (Jess): What's the cause? Boudoir? Lights?
Bill: ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i might be uncomfortable/super awkward with people i don't know in the room if there's people intermingling in the rooms. maybe that?
Aldus Larian (Jess): We can shut off the room for u
Bill: We'll kick anyone needed for that, no problem...
Bill: What cause?
N🆗ri (Marisa): but if they staying in the room i feel bad
N🆗ri (Marisa): rope off boudoir section with towels and blankets. boudoir fort.
Bill: The only person you don't know is like... Tristan.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Has Marisa met Kurtis?
Bill: And ye I'll kick them to other room as needed.
Bill: Actually no, but Kurto is lovable so.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea he good boi
N🆗ri (Marisa): mystery folk
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~how much would I have to pay Tom to do soft boudoir as seven and mc~~
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~One (1) Sexy time~~
Bill: Tho like.
Bill: If we did post Kogaracon MM sleepover...
Bill: Could do bunch of boudoir. With Mawisa!
N🆗ri (Marisa): late night paperwork with jaehee
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg mawisa do raydoir with me
Bill: 🌶
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do we do guy boudoir if we both girls
~~i mean it won't be a problem for me probably and you can do mc but i gotta work out~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): We make it work
Bill: Probably partially clothed?
Bill: Precarious shirt placement.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa u don't gotta work out Ray is a twig
Bill: idk, but need a sleepover first.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye idk where would be good 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: ~~your house~~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): The lighting in my house is shit
Bill: I have standing lights <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well do buodoir pics with my obvious 2b, 707, Yato and other various character posters in the background
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Get you a man that looks at you the way Ray looks at Ray
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmfao
Bill: Not sure if it would fade because of light range and stuff, but also why the hell not.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "hey mc, why do you have a pic of my brother above your bed?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh zens in here too
Bill: "They gave them to me. Signed. They have ego problems"
Aldus Larian (Jess): I just remembered that body pillow came with that double sided note
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg it did
Bill: so beedoir is the only thing going on at Zenkai. kkk.
Bill: One thing planned.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea that's the only thing for sure at least
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Many monies for boudoir
Elfriede Faun (Tom): At least 3
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nah I actually am alright.doing it at the level we're discussing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Catch me actually falling asleep tho
Bill: That mean you wanna at Zenkai? Cause gotta pick a time for that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh, can attest that doing bedroom shoots will make you just want to sleep on the bed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's not something I want for myself but I'm fine with participating
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): We could do 9s and 2b too ~~or both~~
Bill: ~~take the day off work to go do boudoir all thursday~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Umm no
Bill: I mean yes, no.
Bill: But timing is the catch. We get in pretty late thursday.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea id wanna say like afternoon Saturday?
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo biru, this is a nice color for V
https://www.arda-wigs.com/collections/cl-042-mint/products/magnum-classic?variant=2466738176012
Bill: I ordered the one from yesterday though. I think the shipping even got sent through this morning.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo ok nvm then
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I got some kind of shipping notification too this morning
Bill: If that one sucks though, will replace. 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): im beating my head against a wall to find an accurate seven wig
Bill: saturday afternoon is rwby day and I kinda wanna be out and about to see everyone...
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.epiccosplay.com/apollo-13-mint-green-short-cosplay-wig.html
Aldus Larian (Jess): that ones nice too XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The Apollo is what my Blake wig is for reference
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but, appropriate color names
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.epiccosplay.com/apollo-spiky-layered-apple-red-short-cosplay-wig.html
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe thats a good color for seven?
Bill: the customer gallery shows people using it for him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): helps that there are customer images of 707 cosplays xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA! alot of people use like the color of my nora wig but i think thats too orange
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): this might also work? https://www.arda-wigs.com/collections/classic-short-wigs/products/hansel-classic?variant=27836263494
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the color might not be the best though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but between the Hansel and the Apollo, I think the Hansel style would be better for Seven
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i think the syle on the hansel is better but i cant figure out what color
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven's hair color is weird. Like it comes off as red but then put next to a more orangey wig, looks almost the same?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just looking at the Seven wig from the ones Bill and I bought from
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/ApgAAOSwrfVZXL3e/s-l1600.jpg
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea the wiki says "vermilion" which is like no help
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i feel like thats too orange? idk
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom pointed out in alot of pics his hair is oranger on top and fades to red
Bill: Yeah that's kinda the feel I get. a mix of both.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess if I have red paint do you want me to make you a red diamond gem
It won’t be very shiny but I can add sparkles and if you don’t use it for cosplay you can use it as an ~energy crystal~ and constant reminder of the fall of the Soviet Union
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo yes please! if its too much of a hasle
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nah it’s fine
I always make too much and I run around for half an hour trying to dump the resin into as many molds as possible so it’d help because the last few times I took so long trying to find stuff to make that it began hardening
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo ok thanks!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I ordered apple red mix wig so well see how that looks for seven
N🆗ri (Marisa): Apple red mix wig
Boots with the fur
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pretty sure thats the wig i got for ozma, it's so fucking nice i dont wanna cut it
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo the apollo?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye im PRETTY sure
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive never bought from epic coplay before but ive heard good things
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it looks like p5 joker right out of the bag
N🆗ri (Marisa): Epic cosplay wigs are so soft
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i would buy from epic over arda any day. it's so nice. like im shook
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and also not hella expense
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH thats great actually cuz sevens is basically the same thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah actually I don’t get the whole big deal with arda wigs
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i have 1 arda normally i but from amazon i dont use the bigger companies when i need a really specific color or style
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same, the only arda wigs i have are 1 pigtail wig and 1 from before they discontinued the arwen in the exact color i needed for ava
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I only like Arda for specific colors tbh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): otherwise amazon is my babe
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEET
Aldus Larian (Jess): i get alot of comments on my MC/Hiyori wig and thats from ebay
Aldus Larian (Jess): but its soooo thick and ive washed it like 3 times and brushed the shit out of it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its very nice, and also not too shiny
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i like it. even tho long wigs are a pain
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): huge mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't really have a preference between Epic or Arda. Boils down more so to color and style
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and when it comes to the short wigs there's not much difference in price
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea their shorter wigs are about he same
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Arda's Hansel and Epic's Apollo look similar in the website pictures but the Apollo is longer
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeee i can trim, i likes epics colors better for this one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and a bit poofier
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah the color from Epic looks better
Aldus Larian (Jess): what do bois wear for boudoir?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not shirts
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoo!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): idk like silky boxers or sleep pants maybe?
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🤔

Aldus Larian (Jess): yea they should be fine
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe flickr's mainframe went off the grid after the purge

Aldus Larian (Jess): oo biru if we do that youll have to wait for me to de-bodypaint
Bill: NBD. I don't have anything really planned for friday.
Bill: Cept maybe doing the formal dance class panel.
Bill: ~~Assuming you can go without a partner~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ya you can 👍
Aldus Larian (Jess): u gon do class but not go to formal? not judging jw
Bill: I get sad at formals cause I don't have anyone to dance with and lack the confidence to go around asking people. I'd like to do the formal shtick though.
Bill: Ballroom dancing sounds fun to me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): coo
Bill: I'll consider Anext formal, just after last year's Zenkai I figure if I'm skipping one it'll be Zenkai.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): do people actually ballroom dance at the formals?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i did for a bit at the katsu one. we tried to figure it out.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause..... if they actually do at zenkai then maybe i should also attend that how to panel
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i can not dance for shit
N🆗ri (Marisa): watch the ballroom dancing anime. boom you'll be a pro.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theres a ballroom dance anime?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is it cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!! i met the creators and really embarassed myself
Bill: mmm... well. Last year Zenkai was super formal with the string quartet and we all got a little more stressed than the high school dance that Katsu's is.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's got funny moments
Bill: We started a dance circle and were memes, it helped.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they win a contest in one episode because ||the girl was feeling insecure and stuffed her dress with like 20 bra pads and they all spilled out on the dancefloor and tripped the competition so they won by default||
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||but it's ok just the one side fell out||
N🆗ri (Marisa): top 10 anime moments of all time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Bill: That's. wow.
Bill: You'll be fine without the class Leanna, you can dance how you like just like Katsu.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xiao long wiggle?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): excellent
Bill: ye.
Bill: I just wanted to learn actual dancing ~~and show them I'm actually pretty cool~~ since like, last Katsu and I'm lazy as fuck about finding a class outside a con.
Bill: I hope Otakon has the jazz club again, THAT was cool. They did swing classes before that and swing even cooler.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ohhh

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i like what you have, btw
N🆗ri (Marisa): thx i'm gonna mass produce it
Bill: I'm thinking about the different styles of photos. So there's like,

Patreon set, showing off assets, definitely meant to attract people to what you got.a

Spicy couple, like the scenes from movies where they making out and stripping each other as they stumble towards a flat surface

Soft couple, which is is tender touches and being physically close but not like... slamming into doors passion.
Bill: There's also like true boudoir, which is supposed to be like. Personal to you while mostly nekked.
Bill: That's the hardest one to pin down.
Bill: Anyone else got a style I'm missing?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): meme
