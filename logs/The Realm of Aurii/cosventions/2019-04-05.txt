N🆗ri (Marisa): She was only gonna go to pick me up, I can provide payment for taking me home because otherwise it’s two bus rides and a train
Bill: No need, and we certainly aren't going to make you take public transit in phili.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bless ny’all I am forever indebted and BoJo shall be overjoyed with happiness

Bill: > watching video of a boudoir photo posing tutorial

> presenter: "lemme just get my camera"
> Presenter: *takes off shoes*
> me: called it
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia come to sakura sunday like
Bill: *wow this woman can talk for days*
Bill: She hasn't actually *shown* the posing tips, she just keeps rambling.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't talk about me like that
Bill: I have better ways to troll you. 😛
Bill: Her tip, which she's 5 minutes into actually showing, is "Rotisserie Chicken".
Bill: Start on your belly and just. Rotate.
Bill: on bed.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's what I do all night
Aldus Larian (Jess): Counter clockwise
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds like the dream
Aldus Larian (Jess): No wait
Aldus Larian (Jess): Clockwise
Bill: The video was called flow posing and I was hoping it would be able moving from pose to pose but. It's decidedly not any kind of flow.
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *10 minutes*
N🆗ri (Marisa): the rotisserie chicken sounds like a good finishing move in pro wrestling
Bill: *Nothing happened*
Bill: *there was no rotation*
N🆗ri (Marisa): 10 minutes is the minimum length for maximum profits on youtube videos
N🆗ri (Marisa): false advertising
Bill: > looks at another flow posing video
> wait a minute
> Skips to end
> this is a 5 minute long ad for his book
Bill: yeah youtube suck.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooooh Casey did the transforming dress for her dark Weiss!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~now come back to NJ to do double Weiss transformations with Georgia~~
Bill: Ye she did.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!301927856240459777> would this be a thing that could be worn for Sakura?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0785LG4CK/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1D0KU95LRTJX8&psc=1

N🆗ri (Marisa): they look ok?? the belt seems fine and the outfit seems fine, idk what would be the difference between indoor and outdoor tho aaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): here's what google shows for 'men's outdoor yukata' <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: looking at another photo class on linked in for the same guy...
Bill: Be thankful I don't refuse going to resturants based on the quality of light in the place.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "*Yukata* literally means *bath(ing) clothes*, although their use is not limited to after-bath wear." ~Wikipedia
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): doesn't really make a distinction between indoor/outdoor. Just says they're usually worn during the warmer months or for bathing purposes
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're like hotel loungewear too. if you go to a spa or a hotel you'll always get one to wear around the building
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd have to wear the wooden sandals with it to be respectful, right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo geta? they're not so bad to walk in
Bill: (but they're still bad)
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw
Bill: I think you'll be fine with regular sandals at worst.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *yukata ordered*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't know what I would wear these for, but I want https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01N5NH7Z6/ref=sspa_dk_detail_3?pd_rd_i=B01N4M36S7&pd_rd_w=9aCZ1&pf_rd_p=733540df-430d-45cd-9525-21bc15b0e6cc&pd_rd_wg=QHe8F&pf_rd_r=53PV6RTV69FRBQ3MJNFE&pd_rd_r=fdad9bf7-57d3-11e9-9cc9-7768f6408781&th=1&psc=1
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats a blake look
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): welp, time to design my own alternate Blake outfit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could add some purple tulle to the kilt part
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they definitely would go with my boots
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and in true RWBY fashion, they have random useless buckles
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): emo team RWBY

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :ooooooooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): shit, now I'm considering it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ooooo boi
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But you’d be stealing the idea from Hal ;V
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *who stole it from Steelwolf*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): who stole it from  *the concept of genderbending*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Who stole it from the concept of gender
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Who stole it from Hidiyo Kojima
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I should have said JK Rowling, missed opportunity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yukata ordered <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woo
N🆗ri (Marisa): I found my shirt for Dog Tier Jade and WOW have I gotten better at making things since then
Can’t find a skirt though or the hood. I can remake the hood, don’t have fabric for the skirt so can either make it a lot shorter or get a new one. 
Alternatively, make her 3am dress out of the dress I used for the formal at Katsu but I don’t like that dress much I look bad in it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I like the short dogtier but is uncanon
Bill: That’s cute.
Bill: And it’s homestuck so that’s saying something.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ah, thank you, in my homestuck fandom your “cute” is referred to as “adorabloodthirsty.”
Cross cultural exchange is wonderful.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Did we decide on squad cosplay for CPAC yet?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or is, in the wise words of high school musical, we gotta go our own way
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I have no idea ey lmao
Bill: Nothing decided.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Prob something easy with no prop?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They and kogara are both pretty strict I heard
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye I'm prob gonna do catra again or reuse haku
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I might be feelin ladyboog or spidergwen
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess I’m in a spandex mood LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I could possibly do some fixes on Star too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Those are my three most likely, coordinating with friends aside
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If we do RWBY I’d probably pull out Weiss and if BNHA prob Ochako
N🆗ri (Marisa): *someones knocking on the front door while I’m trying to cosplay*
N🆗ri (Marisa): *i can’t find my shirt help*
N🆗ri (Marisa): It was UPS and I can’t move the box so I guess it’s gonna. Stay in that bush for a bit maybe.
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is one of the most difficult costumes to put on like what were Japanese people thinking when they dressed like this for hundreds of years 
It looks better not in my crummy mirror though I promise
Bill: looks awesome and authentic cause arm tie things.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH I’m still workin on that but it might not look proper because I’m tying it myself and chihiro usually has hers tied around the back so I gotta slide the knot from arm to back
N🆗ri (Marisa): Only the right image has the tasuki arm tie, I noticed she only wears it like half the time
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh no these poor costumers have the right idea but they’re not using it correctly so they just have an uncomfortable rope around their arm and neck I hope it didn’t burn them 😱 
That dragon haku tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OWO MAWISA IT LOOKS SO GOOF
N🆗ri (Marisa): we gonna petition miyazaki to give characters easier clothes. everyone's gonna dress like kiki from now on
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh yea, I agree. Pls
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Probably more comfy too
Bill: Kiki voice: "But it's not pretty enough"
N🆗ri (Marisa): but such ease
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _not pretty enough_
Bill: she's that to her mother at the start of the film damnit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah but even when she's alone she doesn't change it <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Well, she has. no other clothes.
Bill: And no money.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she bought groceries <:pew:543202259085950996>
