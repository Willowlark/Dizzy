Bill: Lollll
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): there's a woman trying to contact the convention because she runs a hair salon down the street from zenkaikon and she'd love to try recreating anime hairstyles for con-goers
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): that sounds really neat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg thats so cute
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woahhh
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i wonder if they'll include her in the program, though it might be a little late if the programs are already being printed. probably not too late right now. they like to include local businesses in the program, mainly food places but any local that's willing to work with us
Andrew: That sounds awesome
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): might be expense though
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ehh it's pretty reasonable based on their website. all stylings are between $65 and $100
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh I really wanna redo A2 with an actually good tank top
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause otherwise the tights Iâ€™m REALLY proud of
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): are you back at the gaylord :0
Bill: Do it. Iâ€™ll shoot more A2 when Iâ€™m not worried about you freezing to death.
