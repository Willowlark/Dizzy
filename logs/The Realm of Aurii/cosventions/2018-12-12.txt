Bill: If this isn’t fucking iconic I don’t know what is.
Bill: *I’m just Georgia’s photographer*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Two peas in a podddd
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye id love to shoot with zeikani too lol
Bill: 
Bill: I’ll set it up then. When are you changing to A2?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That whole chunk of time is free
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hunter mentioned shooting A2 but hey, he snoozes he loses
Bill: What a (lucky) surprise. That’s exactly when she suggested, around 3.
Bill: 3-4, Georgia, or you want to cut it shorter than the usual.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im gucci with 3-4
Bill: K.
Bill: Done. Mark it down.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): diddly darn done
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): looking at my schedule again... i might nix ochako altogether and just change into pj ochako earlier in the night
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im gonna pay for a cosplay to run around in for 2.5 hours 🤔
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ehhhh ill think about it
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> I didn’t mention to Zeikani you being 2Butt and Adamn. I’m not sure if it would be weird to go from one group shoot to another identical shoot? It’s literally swapping Zeikani for Justin. I will if you’d like to do moar Nier. Going to think of ways to make the shoots different anyway.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): have zeikani AND justin stab me at the same time in the interim between shoots
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Right now I have our shoot scheduled for 5
Bill: Also I have a minishoot I want you two for. I bought a thinkgeek scarf, it’s black and white and has binary on it. I want you guys to closet cosplay winter!2B&9S and we can use the scarf to take some gay photos. Preferably in snow. What say you.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So there would technically be an you in between
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oh nier is at 5? i have it as 4:30
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 5 works too tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Tom's not bringing 9S if he's doing Adam
Bill: 4:30 is the better time frame.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ok, I'll move it
Bill: Not at Katsu.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ok so 3-4 with zeikani and then 430-5 with Justin ?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): And yea that sounds cute biru
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That whole half hour will be me taking a break from my shoes
Bill: The Zeikani one is optional. I haven’t mentioned you two will be in Nier yet.
Bill: I won’t if you don’t want to do back to back shoots of 2B/9S/A2/Adam.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm fine with it, IDK about Tom
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): sad android two hour marathon whoooooot
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): justin is only being sad androids all saturday i believe
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes connor from detroit on saturday morning
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm happy peppy girls on Friday and murder waifus on Saturday
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I wanna make a word for 2B too, so hopefully I can get that done, I'd like do get more pics actually wearing the blindfold since I usually get lazy and don't
Bill: I can remind you for that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): God, I wish I could stick out as a 2B cosplayer but it's so hard 😭
Bill: You the only 2Butt that matters here.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ❤
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Tank
Bill: You wrote something else, what was it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I wish we could get an Eve, that would be uld be sick
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): couldnt hurt to post to the katsu group
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo that's scary tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~why can't Tom's brother just get into cosplay~~
Bill: Maybe with Zeikani... I’d like to get some solos with our golden hour slot.
Bill: Hopefully.
Bill: Idk.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Gotta get dat Ferris wheel in the background
Bill: I’m going to go deal with the fact I’m the Jake to Georgia’s Casey now.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _white architecture YEAH_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): idk man jake carries tampons for casey
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wouldnt put THAT role on you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Tampons are very important
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think if i trust anyone for a tampon it would be jess or rebecca
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i feel like i dont con with many girls 🤔
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): when marisa gets back thatll change tho <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thatll be +1 girl to the con counter
Bill: ,...
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): not that it matters in any regard besides the tampon scenario
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): boys are cool
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): they just dont carry tampons LOL
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YE I got tampons
Bill: ,...If you guys have a winter outfit for Nines and 2B (more than likely black coats tbh) already, next weekend we have snow we can run out and do that at a local park. Quick and easy, as well as not freezing.
Bill: Can’t do it after work because of sunset.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We don't have black cats 😬
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Dark grey but not black
Bill: Well, I leave outfit to you.
Bill: Just need them for a snowy weekend.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Uhhhh idk if I have a casual warm black outfit at all tho 😔
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean the dark grey could prob work (also Tom didn't say anything)
Bill: Idk. You guys talk. I’m game, it’s up to you.
Bill: 
Bill: The scarf, for reference.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo neat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Why brain bleach
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@245270932602486784>  do you use your natural eyes for A2?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i use see through enlarging contacts
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so theyre my normal color but more wide
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so i have more fake looking eyes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo ok gotcha I gotta find a good blue for 2B
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Doesn’t she wear a blindfold?
Just walk around with a blindfold. It’s fine.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): No issues could arise
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Georgia was I shooting your team RWBY Friday.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): nope the nora got a photographer already she said
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): who, btw, the nora is really nice
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but she asks her followers to buy her a wig like every other day
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and when they fund one wig she just asks for another immediately afterwards
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so annoying
Bill: K.
Bill: I have slots for Katsu, which I usually don’t do but it’ll work. One Friday and two Saturday. Maybe I’ll “raffle” them via Instagram.
Bill: Idk.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oooo ya raffle them!
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> bleach cause Jake and Casey.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): also did tom and jess figure their line up? are we switching pyrrha 3.0 in the morning to NPR?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~why is it that we're always missing a jaune like wtf~~
Bill: I didn’t know that was being considered, but.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): it just popped into my head

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m not at my computer but pretend this is my schedule
🗒
Bill: Fuck it 11 for mystic messenger.
Bill: Good call.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oo wait lemme throw a time in the persona chat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What did you have it at? I just out int tentative times
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Georgia you’re lining up for the formal? :0
Did they reach capacity last year?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): bill when are you free to shoot persoNYAH on sunday?
Bill: I didn’t have a time Jess.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think formal gets pretty close every year
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo ok
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its one of my fav events so i dont wanna take chances
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ooo interesting, I don’t recall it ever being too packed
Bill: ~~see if Erik wants to make Jumin con ready~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Shoutout to that one time Gary from anime club danced with me and I didn’t recognize him despite him not cosplaying
Bill: Rip Gary.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): He told me about his engagement during the dance 👏
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't have any shoots for Nora yet so if you wanna do NPR then we can just let me know time ~~would be cool if we could get a jaune~~
Bill: I have nothing but the 11am for Mystic Messenger, which afaik is flexible. Persona should be after room exodus.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): My Friday is jam packed but I’ve got time on Saturday if anyone wants a lame shoot on sat, or sun
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Biru what’s your cosplay lineup
Bill: I am partial to solo Pyrrha Georgia. (No offense Jess/Tom). I haven’t shot solo Pyrrha since we met, and we’ve done lots of NPR.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): holy shit youre right
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i feel OLD
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats coo tho, im good with that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): the last hurdle on pyrrha version 3 is that damn neckbrace and greaves
Bill: Maybe PJ Mirio. I doubt I’ll wear his uniform for Friday BNHA stuff because I’ll need full mobility for the schedule I have.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Solo shots can also be done during group shoots right? 

I was thinking about the photogs I rejected last konkon and how I should’ve taken a selfie because I don’t have a solo picture from that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well the nora/ren spot are semi tentative anyway, especially if no one is shooting us we might??? drop it?? idk yet
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): WOO COSPLAY
Bill: Maybe Zenkai I’ll do Hazel like I said I would for Katsu.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): marisa, when can i book your photography skillz <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was more like we were only gonna do it for georgia? kinda sorta? and our wallets
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I can shoot u jess if it’s on Saturday or Sunday pew pew
<:lenny:395307171539189760> anytime yo
I can come up with an official schedule when I’m back at my computer to see when I’m free
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ooo makes sense
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): dawww the garritys are too good to me ❤
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): what styles you like marisa? anything to shoot in particular?
Bill: Yes Marisa, can do solos in a group shoot, but Georgia vastly prefers being with other people in shoots and that ends up taking priority.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I like lots of saturation <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Otherwise I prefer to be familiar with the source material but I know all your costumes so it shouldn’t be an issue. I can’t really think of a particular style I do, maybe I ask people to look away from the camera a lot? but I can drop my Flickr
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): humans are social creatures and georgia is no exception
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Georgia the social butterfly
Bill: Yeah yeah.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its easier with friends cause  you dont have to overthink posing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): though im overdue for a solo shoot OOPS
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): When I see another human being I go into fight or flight mode and start hissing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): marisa you wanna shoot fallout? the retro feel might be good with saturation 🤔
Bill: You’ve been doin solo shit with Hunter. Wouldn’t say overdue.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): nah i shot with casey
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and any times ive gotten solos ~~i havent been very happy with them~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Sure!
I’d say my style is “over saturated and low quality that focuses on the costume overall or costume details”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like i still cant get over how white i look in the weiss photo
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): https://flickr.com/photos/149364684@N02/sets/72157683894181185
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like is it just me or am i too white there? i asked him about it too and he was like uhhh youre weiss and i was like well yeah i look like a ghost tho
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): My camera has two whole aperture settings so blurred backgrounds are obviously shopped <:lenny:395307171539189760>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Wow u pale
Bill: I’m less and less impressed with Hunter the more I see. ~~But he still manages to make me fucking jealous all the time so yippee fucking kaiyaY~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he does doubles well
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): singles.................... eh
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): You kind of clash with the background, if it was different I don’t think it’d stand out at all
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Gives off Gravity Falls vibes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i feel like overall its just a really unflattering edit
Bill: It’s harsh lighting, and I’m pretty sure he made color edits around the face.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and when i asked about it, i got snubbed
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he sets up two people in photos well; see any of the blake and yang photos
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and the ochako/bakugo photo
Bill: Mhmm.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but i dont necessarily agree with all his edits, and he tends not to optimize well for instagram
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): pros and cons
Bill: Whatever.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes not getting back to me about shooting either so
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): katsu schedule is filling up <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): <@!301927856240459777> how long you wanna shoot the fallout?
Bill: I don’t have you down for fallout, coordinate with Jake. Though Chatterbox was the pinnacle of Sole Survivor so I’m depending I could take or leave the shoot.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Based on my phone app here’s what you’d look like with slightly tanned skin and some Christmas lights in the sky
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): jake is being a flake oof
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _marisa thats so much better_
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I can do any time. My default time is 30 minutes but I can do 15 or I can go as long as needed
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): when you free on saturday :>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): maybe i should wake up earlier on friday i need more pyrrha time ahhh
Bill: You’re already doing the whole day.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but sunset shoots me in the foot
Bill: eh ma.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I can do Saturday morn before 1pm, or give me about 12 hours and I can find a more specific time after that!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): fallout is that chunk of time
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah the scraf thing sounds neet
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ooo neato burrito that works perfectly then
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Also I'm alright with continuing the shoot to zeikani but if she wants to do it solo with Georgia that's okay to, no hard feelings
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): We can do it right after getting up and getting ready if that works
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'll likely be sick of shooting by then anyways, but ill do it to meet people 👌
Bill: Kk. I’ll let her know and see if she wants to specifically duo or open to group.
Bill: ~~If she specifically wants to duo that’s sketch to me but *I’m not Jake*~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): how is that sketch? maybe im too trusting hm hm
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): When are we all signing up for photos with deuce loosely? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Who dat <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: No deuce. I’ll put my foot down.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Everyone’s favorite Zenkaikon staff member who does photography. We’ve talked about him. Uhhhh loose canon Ltd? Is that what he goes by
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i read that as loose lenny limited
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): That’s him thats the boy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mawisa would you wanna do swimsuit 2B for me at da pool at some point?
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): YEAH!! POOL PARTY
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Splash splash
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA coo i was thinking sometime Sunday afternoon/night?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I have a hello kitty SD card I can bring to Katsu to make the pictures better. It’s a normal sd card but it’s pink with hello kitty so all the pictures will obviously be slightly better. 
That’d be perf 👌
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hello kitty makes everything better
Bill: Oh wise Mawisa, greatest cosplay photographer of all, might I observe your masterful talents in action that evening?
Bill: ~~I’ll have nothing else to do anyway~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i only asked marisa cuz she mentioned wanting to go down to the pool, and ive never shot with her before, OO also i can can do some pics for you too if you want mawisa but i dont have a camera so i can maybe use yours, or my phone
Bill: ~~Shoots Tom being distractingly sexy and wet at the other end the pool~~

~~”No emotions 2B”~~

~~Jess *drools*~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ya sure just pay me the $250 student fee no problem
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im not even planning on tom going lmao
Bill: Ye nah, I wasn’t being passive aggressive. Shoot with Mawisa!
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Yes pwease I can give you my camera if you take pics I would be forever grateful
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA POOL PICS
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Biru I can shoot you too. That pinup swimsuit shoot you’ve been dying to do
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I didnt get any pics of it at CCE cuz im dumb
Bill: Does you insurance cover eyes bleeding?
Bill: You’ll need that first.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~my eyes probably do that anyway~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Is this a different swimsuit 2b? I thought I’ve seen pictures of it before :0
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i only took like 1 selfie
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i have older ones from 2017 but i revamped her 2018
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Oooo!!
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’ve been doing this thing recently where I have my phone record in slo-mo and then screenshot the best frame. It’s low quality cell phone pic but it’s a good way to capture stuff that’s hard to get otherwise. My camera also has a continuous shoot setting but I like the slow mo way too
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Reliable method of getting cape flips and jump shots if you just want fun things for social media
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~Katsu: the first and only time people shoot with me lol~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WAT NO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ill shoot with you at other cons too!
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): It ok no need to torture yourself 👌 do the trial shoot first before subjecting yourself to more horrors
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): What if I brought a hand puppet like the mall Santa photographers use for little kids
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): “Look here!! Look! Look at the puppet!! Yaaay smile!!!”
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): OMG
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): THAT PUPPET
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): AGH
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): AGH
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): THATS ADORABLE
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): The experiment was a rousing success
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): MARISA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Did you make that?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): nO i wish it was a thing sold by animate some years back
but i was considering making a replica of it a few minutes ago
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YES
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i made dolls of the yona dragons a couple years ago but i can't find pictures of them. bluh.

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😱
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): flaaffy there is about 3 feet tall if memory serves. or however big flaaffy's height is in the pokedex. i made them to scale.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): caterpie was 1' and ninetails was just over 5'
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Juliana wound up carry it more than me lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THATS SO CUTE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What happened to nine tails?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Still have it, just took out all the stuffing and reused it for other stuff because it was massive. It’s skin is in a tote in the living room <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
I can revive it by filling it up with stuffing again
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I don’t think I have any pictures though rip
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Damn that's crazy
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's so much work for Pokemon replicas 😱
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Great job tho
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I can't believe we locked out 2 channels guis <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WOW
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): in other news we need a peko pekoyama for our group now <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): good job person
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's easier to find a peko and a kuzuryuu together than one of each so maybe we'll have a little luck. although it might also be a little late.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): who is dey?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo you need the boy or the girl?

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do you have to play them all tog et it or could ou just play the latest one?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Bathing suit pics are too powerful, imma have to redo my top nine
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): hmmm. it's better to play them together.
two mmmmaybe you could get away with not playing 1? but the ending might rely on 1 and there's a lot of references to the first one
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): you could watch the 12 episode anime that's essentially the entire 1st game
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): then play the 2nd
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): are just 1,2, and 3 important, or are all the other ones important too?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~i actually haven't played or watched 3 yet oops i'm a fake fan~~
another episode is a spin-off so it's not necessary
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I know that 3 has characters from the first two though
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooooo neat
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Here’s who we still need if you know anyone
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I cosplay monomi too but sadly I can’t cosplay 2 characters at once
