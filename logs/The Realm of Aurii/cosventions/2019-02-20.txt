N🆗ri (Marisa): auuughhaegi
i know y'all take off your makeup like good clean people but i just heard a story about a woman who didn't clean off her mascara for over ten years and it's horrifying
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): it wound up forming a pre-cancerous mass behind her eyelid that nearly blinded her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG NOooooOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye like she wouldn't clean her mascara off at all she'd just keep re-applying it every few days for *years*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's terrifying
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh i forgot the other ray jacket was in the washer
still gross lol rip
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭 awwww nuuuu!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Did you use any stain remover on it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no :0 we don't have any i don't think? the detergent has stain removing magic in it i think
 I'll ask bojo when she gets home in a few minutes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have this stuff called Dreft that is for baby stains like puke and other nasty stuff
Dirty Lego (Tom): How doesn't stay on in the shower tho aghhh
N🆗ri (Marisa): Mysterious baby stains
N🆗ri (Marisa): Waterproof mascara maybe? Yikes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean ot would still stay on as long as you don't scrub
Bill: priceless.
N🆗ri (Marisa): RUDE HAND NO PUT THAT AWAY
Bill: Mina is the first golden hour shoot to not look meh imo.
Bill: I  find golden hour tends to suck in real life.
Bill: *This is where I'd put my Tom*

*If I had one*
Bill: *She think*
Bill: I'm getting pissed off at the flash just looking at all the underlit ones.
Bill: Cryptid?
N🆗ri (Marisa): **c r y p t i d**
N🆗ri (Marisa): i fix
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's my new business card photo the cryptid one
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it just me or is the whole concept of the taiyang/summer pregnancy shoot a little eerie
unless that's erik's actual girlfriend
Bill: Erik told me it was Hunter's idea.
N🆗ri (Marisa): seems a bit weird
the pictures are really cute but having it be a cosplay thing feels uncanny valley
Bill: good term.
Bill: I can see it being mildly okay. given the cahracters.
Bill: oof. to Giants swords and Nier composition generally.
Bill: Nobody ditch for me for Hunter over this one.
Bill: There's some quality, and some stuff that is grade A "Too cold was not thinking"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IT ME
Dirty Lego (Tom): It is a little off
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lainy and Eric did spend a ton of time together last katsu
Dirty Lego (Tom): People kinda assumed they were hitting it off
Dirty Lego (Tom): But she's dating Dan so
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's what mina does when mineta gets creepy
Bill: Lanie told Dan all about it when they started dating. The shoot was planned way before they started going out.
Bill: Apparently Dan really likes Erik.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): HUH
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): is that who sent erik the question about 3 ways
Bill: Not. That kind of like.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH DAMN
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean Dan like dudes too
Bill: Not. Really.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): as evidenced by his shoot with ryan
Bill: Everything with Ryan was staged.
Bill: He was like, mildly appalled when I told him I had thought he was gay for a year.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "pan after"
Bill: ah. Well, at the least, Erik just said Dan considered him a friend.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Most likely yea
Dirty Lego (Tom): Erik don't like dude tho,but I'd prob be fine with letting Eric do that too, he's respectful
Dirty Lego (Tom): In that situation
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ☝️
Dirty Lego (Tom): Not something planned after tho
Dirty Lego (Tom): Might be a bit wierd
Bill: Oh rip I thought that was Jess who said she'd be okay with it.
Bill: Jess would totally okay with Tom doing a pregnancy shoot with Erik.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea Tom can shoot boudoir with erik
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmao
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Alot of people ship Jumin and Saeran
N🆗ri (Marisa): good plans for zenkai
Bill: 👀
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): group boudoir wot
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): or as erik said, softoir
Bill: I still have an interest in trying boudoir, though I want to actually *do* it if I bring the lights again. *After Anna and Mag running around in underwear all con it's not really that much of a stretch to boudoir is it*.
Bill: It's. Odd. That even with prompt Gen and Chris didn't do a kiss shot at Persona. Futaba is a popular ship, it would make sense canon wise.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Really? That is weird
Bill: I've decided I don't like mid size groups so much either. If I'm going to shoot what I wanna shoot, Persona shoot was too big.
Bill: And didn't need as much content as we shoot, tbh.
Bill: 4 people to a shoot is the max. +-1 or two.
Dirty Lego (Tom): He was sick
Bill: Oh shit that must be it.
Bill: Good spot.
バナナ: such good edits to jess' photo, nice job marisa
Bill: She'll never notice me if I touch her hand without looking at her.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He sneak
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I look so sexual
Bill: https://www.dropbox.com/s/g48csb6qyducpdm/F%20-190217%20Katsucon%201843.jpg?dl=0

Bill: I like the stuff with Jumin better than Ray quality wise, but there's a good amount more of Ray stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye sowwy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wait like photo quality?
Bill: shut it, it's not because of you. It's because it got dark.

Andrew: im sitting here sketching out how im gonna redo ryomas mask
Andrew: really wanna improve it by zenkai
Andrew: 
Andrew: 3 pieces this time should make it look less flat
Andrew: i got thinner ffoam this time
Andrew: Is there like a putty or something I can fill gaps in with?
Dirty Lego (Tom): Hmm I've heard of people using something like that but I can't remember what it's called
Andrew: 
Andrew: It has a lot of smooth edges so I figured it could help fill them
Dirty Lego (Tom): I googled it and there's a number of stuff
Dirty Lego (Tom): Flex bond? Sounds like one
Dirty Lego (Tom): Wait nah
Dirty Lego (Tom): Acrylic cauking
Andrew: thats like concrete i think lol
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah I mis read

Dirty Lego (Tom): <@301927856240459777> do you know the normal con max weapon height?
Dirty Lego (Tom): Or like average ish
N🆗ri (Marisa): hewwo
5' on the lower end, 6' maximum usually. a lot of cons have middle ground of around 5.5'
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've seen as little as 3' and as high as 8' though so it really varies where the con is taking place, but most are around that size
Dirty Lego (Tom): Imight go for 6ft then if I build anything big 🙏 thank you all knowing seer
Andrew: I fixed the length finally
Andrew: Next step is lots of glue
Andrew: Abd awaiting the clay I ordered
Dirty Lego (Tom): Wooooo
