Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Saturday we have d and d and Sunday idk yet
Bill: Not a specific Saturday or Sunday yet... 3 weekends between Katsu and now.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mm k
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo packed up most of my stuff into boxes like i was never coming back and i've found most essentials but i can't figure out where most of my costumes are. i found the wigs no problem but the costumes themselves elude me, which include jade and corrin and maki and is incredibly frustrating. i still have ~20 days to find them but if i can't what should i replace them with.
i have confidence they will be found because i'm absolutely gonna tear the house apart, but what should i bring if i can't find them hhhhh
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): bring your sweet self to hug
N🆗ri (Marisa): i dunno if i can find that how about some origami frogs instead
Dirty Lego (Tom): You'll find em!
N🆗ri (Marisa): the key to finding things here is:
you have to not be looking for it
you will find it immediately after you need it

case in point: the thing i was supposed to bring to kotoricon that i found immediately when i came home and was looking for something else
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): big truths
