Afina Tyndall (Georgia): holy baloney
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i better be able to swing from buildings with that price tag
Aldus Larian (Jess): Shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): jeez
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like Leanna got a much cheaper one...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0733N17KW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?th=1&psc=1
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this one looks just like the 250 dollar one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): only for 69.99 <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but Labinak is a full-time professional cosplayer, therefore must have the most expensive costumes
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): She is?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol no I'm being sarcastic
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at least I don't think she actually is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I honestly don't know what she does for income other than donations
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and by Labinak I mean Mangoloo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I have no idea what she does either
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think she works at sephora
Bill: Iâ€™ve heard that.
Bill: Probably from you so it doesnâ€™t add anything.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She is
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Or shes about to be
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Because she just moved in with Jake and hes taking extra work shifts so he can pay for the apartment alone
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): To support her
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn
Bill: Yeah theyâ€™re pretty serious. I dunno what he does either though.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): jake is too good for this earth
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He loves her so much its adorable
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But also I hope doing that doesnt bite him in the ass, I hope he can handle it without going crazy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he just wants to craft shit and support casey
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): A GOOD MAN
Bill: Yeah heâ€™s. Pretty great.
Bill: Iâ€™m glad him and Casey worked out.
Bill: Hunter was telling us how he was worried for awhile there.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hunter wasnt sure jake could handle the famous drama?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _like that guy writing smut on archive of our own_
Bill: Apparently Jake had a thing for her first, and Hunter wasnâ€™t sure if Jake would wait long enough for Casey to notice/acknowledge etc.
Bill: He was worried Jake would have given up being just a friend and distanced himself.
Bill: I just remember the gist of the story, I donâ€™t think Casey was ignoring him explicitly or anything.
Bill: I think she just didnâ€™t get it for awhile.
Bill: Iâ€™m sure the famous drama is a learning curve too though.
Bill: Anyway Iâ€™m off to bed.
