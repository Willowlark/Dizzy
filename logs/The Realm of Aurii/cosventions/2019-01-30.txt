Bill: Kira likes to cosplay herself, so I bet she's easy to get. Doesn't seem like a big star either.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the bare minimum is usually all travel expenses, hotel, and food covered, plus maybe $100 for any minor emergencies over the weekend, and then however much the guest is charging which is where negotiation comes in
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Kira, go to zenkai plz
N🆗ri (Marisa): recommend her!!
