Aldus Larian (Jess): I think they use airsoft guns?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): o3o that makes sense, bless
Kaio Vermino (Lee): do they have to take the trigger out?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): for cons
Kaio Vermino (Lee): or glue it or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think so? im not positive tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yeah the gut them and glue them
Nokri (Marisa): Ye guns for cons can’t have any real metal or any moving parts whatsoever
Tikur (Kurtis): Yeah gut em and glue em
Kaio Vermino (Lee): gotcha, this gonna be more work than originally planned...... but thats ok it'll be sick
Tikur (Kurtis): You can get super cheap ones that people are selling for parts
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Tikur (Kurtis): Amy specific gun you looking for?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): no idea yet tbh, im trying to find one that fits the character
Kaio Vermino (Lee): so i was planning on just looking around at them and deciding based on looks mostly
Tikur (Kurtis): I have a broken one o can send you a pic of
Kaio Vermino (Lee): im gonna be painting it cherry red  with lime green accents
Tikur (Kurtis): Ooooh that seems dope
Bill: ~~see I wasn’t bringing up the RE cosplay I guess Tom secretly wants to do it then~~
Bill: I need a golden deer squad to literally meme around a con with.
Aldus Larian (Jess): bold of to asume tom even read that part of the chat
Bill: Andrew gotta Dimitri up like “my house is depressed” and I’ll be like “our house” and the whole squad pops up “IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR STREET”
Tikur (Kurtis): What a mood
Bill: And gotta follow around Edelgard chanting hoes mad.
Nokri (Marisa): In the middle of our house

Tikur (Kurtis): 28 inches long
Tikur (Kurtis): 19 with stock folded

Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Tikur (Kurtis): Hold up sling just died 😭
Kaio Vermino (Lee): it ok, i dont need sling o3o
Tikur (Kurtis): Okydoky!
Tikur (Kurtis): When you want this by?
Nokri (Marisa): @ biru i would say i could do marianne/lysithea with the bernie uniform but their collars are diffrent different, I don't know how the uniform is gonna work until I pattern it out so there's a 50/50 chance i could do other characters with bernie's uniform. i'd just need to make a second skirt and a tux front
Kaio Vermino (Lee): uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, ima finish the outfit first so maybe a couple weeks, i can always come pick it up or something
Tikur (Kurtis): Cool beans fam 👌
Kaio Vermino (Lee): thank you!!!!!
Tikur (Kurtis): You are more than welcome!
Tikur (Kurtis): Any gun painting advice? <@228287793099440128> <@325788935865368578>
Glonk: ashe and i buy them off ebay if they're cheap enough. yes, you should gut them and remove the trigger so con staff will have an easier time.
Glonk: i've airbrushed my one gun, but that takes a long time due to cleaning the brush. but the 2 most recent ones  that i have done, and all the ones ashe has done are hand painted with acrylics.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): do you do a base layer of spray paint? or just go right into acrylics?
Glonk: depends on the paint, the one that i posted on insta today used acrylics that were thin, so i had to coat the gun with ~~flex seal~~ plasti dip
Glonk: so the paint would adhere better
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ahhhh ok gotcha, thank you so much!
Glonk: They heard me...
Glonk: 
Tikur (Kurtis): They know

Bill: ~~that and I don't expect anyone to bother remembering~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean i remember you talking about her but i dont think you ever mentioned her doing art? idk i was just confused becuase you said "that artist" and i have no clue what that was referring too
Bill: Oh yeah I brought her up originally cause her art account popped up on my feed.
