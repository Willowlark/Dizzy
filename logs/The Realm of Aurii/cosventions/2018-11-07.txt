Bill: https://www.redrivercatalog.com/cost-of-inkjet-printing-canon-pro-100.html <@!351471675843411978> does this make sense to you? Trying to estimate what the cost per print would be for a 13x19.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea seems about right.
Bill: So.... itâ€™s 2.70?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea. That's estimated of course but it's decent estimate
Bill: Pretty good.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): has anyone ever used this kind of stuff before
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if i glue it to my shoes i hope it doesn't wreck everything i walk on
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo never used that ðŸ˜®
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i usually use foot pads for shoe covers but i'm gonna be making the whole shoe and i don't want the plastidip to rub off while walking, so the pads are too small unless i buy a ton and cut them up. but I think using this tape is cheaper and has the same effect.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OH SNAP arda is having a sale that lasts for like another hour i think. 15% off.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): arda actually doesn't have a big collection. that sucks.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ok i just ate 18 creampuffs and i'm buying the wig because it's about the same I'd pay on black friday
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NICE
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i've never bought arda wigs before but they're like the industry standard
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): speaking of wigs, I got my nejire wig in and it was completly wring
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OH NO
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): HOW
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): sue them
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): in the pic it was one solid color and what i got was like a blue and white gradient
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oh noooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was really cool, but not what i needed
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i guess there's no way to properly dye it a uniform color because the gradient will mess everything up
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ~~unless you gradient dye it???~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah im just gonna return it
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): o good idea i didn't think of that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): SHIT Arda has 2 day shipping?
