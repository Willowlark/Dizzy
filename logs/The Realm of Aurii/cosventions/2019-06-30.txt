Bill: The con bubble is burstinggggg
Bill: I went to morristown comic con earlier. Comic cons have less cool swag, but I met that cosplayer who I knew from rowan anime club and did a shoot for her and her boyfriend(?). Which was good and the pictures are BANGING. 

And Nick and Allison were there so we hung out! Was good.
Bill: ^ Good shit
Bill: 
Bill: comic cons have a totally different feel from anime cons.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It okat
Nokri (Marisa): i'm doing photoshoots again for otakon since that's usually a big photoshoot con for me. if anyone is interested i guess let me know, but i'm waiting for them to release the autograph schedules so if anyone wanted to plan something it might possibly get switched around.
Nokri (Marisa): o i should post that in bne too when i figure out non-friend rates that'd be a good idea
Nokri (Marisa): jess and georgia is it ok if i use pictures of you to advertise
Nokri (Marisa): from katsu
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye for sure!
Aldus Larian (Jess): id be interested but i dont have a line up yet lol

Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i be there all weekend
Andrew: Im debating whether do do full armor Ryoma or meme lobster lord

Andrew: summer lobster it is
Nokri (Marisa): yeah we gotta walk in the heat/rain/sun whatever it is
Andrew: shield gonna be tough but ill make that my only heavy outfit
Nokri (Marisa): i gotta figure out what to wear to the formal
Nokri (Marisa): if i asked bne members and strangers for $15 per shoot do you guys think that's too much
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah thats cheap af
Nokri (Marisa): is cheap for photoshoots in general, but i feel like it's way overcharging for my quality
and it might discourage people from shooting with me, but also a couple of shoots would pay for groceries
Aldus Larian (Jess): your pics are really good marisa, you need the cash and 15 is suuuuper reasonable
Aldus Larian (Jess): is that for half hour?
Nokri (Marisa): i wanted to make it an hour so people feel like they're getting their money's worth but honestly 30 minutes is plenty of time <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 15 is good price for a half hour id say charge a lil more for an hour
Nokri (Marisa): $16
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): if anyone asks for samples of my work i just show them this
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmaoo pls
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): is it cheating to go through old pictures and touch them up
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah fam
Bill: No, and you are easily good enough to charge 15~20.
Bill: Going hour isn‚Äôt needed unless it a big group.
Nokri (Marisa): i took this shoot of diana in like. 2014 or so and they're awful but they look a little better with more editing
