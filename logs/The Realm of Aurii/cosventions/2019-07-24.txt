Aldus Larian (Jess): Does anyone have purple eyeliner I can borrow Saturday morning for my eyebrows
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t sorry ;-;

Aldus Larian (Jess): Yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz I need to iron too <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): Woooo I didn’t want to be *that person* but also I didn’t want to spend forever ironing stuff that’s gonna get wrinkled again anyway
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah gurl you good mine wrinkly af
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whomp no V this weekend cuz Tom's pants don't fit past my thicc thighs
Aldus Larian (Jess): *binds thighs along with chest*
Nokri (Marisa): I also didn’t want to iron on the toilet because the broken pipe makes it smelly, and that’s the only place we have to iron
Nokri (Marisa): Stockings!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah that ain't gonna help I'm not even sure they'd fit my waist if I got them past my thighs
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760> guuurl
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sall good, less to pack
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unless I wear leggings V
Aldus Larian (Jess): But that doesn't feel right 😂
Nokri (Marisa): Yoga pants V
Nokri (Marisa): Stuff the front
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760> <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): HIPPIE V
Andrew: Ill prob join the iron party
Nokri (Marisa): Let’s rant about history while flailing a hot steaming piece of metal around
Bill: Oooh I might not bring V then. He’d be really hot.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye he's hot
Aldus Larian (Jess): NVM I don't have that many sweet beeds
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🤔 good end saeran is comfy tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'll already have das shoes on me anyway
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'll draw a sign that says "have you seen my after end?"
Bill: Lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||(also my brother)||
Tikur (Kurtis): <@351471675843411978> Thicc thighs save lives
Aldus Larian (Jess): But not genderbends cosplays
Nokri (Marisa): I can’t find morg’s beeeelt
Maybe I’ll cheap out and do Emma again
Nokri (Marisa): Thicc Saeran
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have pants that fit for saeran tho! 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can borrow Tom's pants for saeran and seven but not v cuz they super tight and for some reason ~~i just mispelled seven as saeven~~
Bill: The girl who gave me the kofi asked about a Saturday shoot. Bet that’s why she remembered the tip lol. I’m considering it too, tho I don’t want to cut into friend time anymore than my shoots are.
Tikur (Kurtis): <@351471675843411978> Guys can have thicc thighs
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok 4 waifus and one husbando packed
Tikur (Kurtis): Woo!
Bill: Okay I gave her a shoot at 11 so now my downtime Saturday is 1 to 3, 1 to 4 if whoever wants to do swing lessons wants to do the 8pm one instead of 3.
Nokri (Marisa): What if I did bloody ear Emma
Nokri (Marisa): I’ve got some good fake blood from my theater club days
Nokri (Marisa): I could cover up my ear and bloody it up instead of doing the gauze 
Too much?
Bill: I don't think so.
Andrew: Me neither.
Andrew: Do it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do it
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think that would be sweet
Nokri (Marisa): hmm it's not too bloody in the show
maybe just some tissue with blood dripping down from it
Nokri (Marisa): if i even get to wear her. might not have time to change all day until 8pm
Nokri (Marisa): unless the trigger autographs are full, i'll have time then
Nokri (Marisa): why can't cons be like. a week long.
Bill: I have a full docket of shoots Saturday.
Bill: Maybe I should drop all being Kaminari.
Nokri (Marisa): but cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): i literally don't have time for bathroom breaks most of the day and i'm cosplaying all day
Bill: You’re you.
Nokri (Marisa): that's me!
Bill: It’s going to be an annoyance at worst most of the day, and even if it comfortable I’ll barely be with Erik/Georgia in BNHA... it’s casual, so no one is going to be like “picture”...
Nokri (Marisa): cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): コスプレ
Bill: Marisa, you will never suggest not cosplaying so your opinion is just a weeeee bit biased.
Nokri (Marisa): アンドリュー、日本語を話そう。久しぶりに練習したからアンドリュー、日本語を話そう。久しぶりに練習したから忘れ始めちゃうんだよ。
Nokri (Marisa): whaaaat? no way
Nokri (Marisa): impossible
Aldus Larian (Jess): V but no jacket <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cosplay and you're in character <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: That’s still a wog and warm clothes. Kaminari is shorts and a t shirt, actually better in that department.
Nokri (Marisa): i worry about people cosplaying in hot weather and then i remember i wore edea for a couple hours in 103 degrees
Bill: I’m not you so.
Nokri (Marisa): you're also not in ~5 layers of fleece, faux fur, and vinyl
Nokri (Marisa): edea lives in a very cold climate :3c
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hippie V
Bill: I’m worried I’m going to get none of the fun part of cosplaying and just the meh parts. Like, if we had lineups sooner (including myself), I’d have left my shoots light or friends only to enjoy the wandering around together part. I’m not going to get that part and that’s all I really want from the cosplaying?
Nokri (Marisa): oh i'm packing cat underwear so i can wear it with blake because gotta get use out of that $5 set

what about filming videos of yourself in cosplay
Bill: I had no intention of bringing the light stands in for boudoir, so unless we decide a time for that I’m not bringing them in from the car.
Nokri (Marisa): i figured was a no go and didn't want to bother anyone with it anyway
no time at all
Bill: We could do it if you. Talked to me about it.
Bill: Geh. I’m going to bed, I’ll sleep on the Kaminari thing.
Nokri (Marisa): i just decided it like 5 minutes ago when i saw it with the blake stuff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): damn I should have gotten cat underwear and we could have matched as Blake
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!!!
do they make guy cat underwear
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably not
Nokri (Marisa): guess you'll have to get the girl's version then
Nokri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at least they're cute
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): omg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Nokri (Marisa): idk if i can go to the swing practice but maybe i can stop by the dance afterwards
what kind of swing do they teach? if it's east coast swing or lindy hop i can probably do ok-ish without the lessons
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have no idea how to do either
Nokri (Marisa): they easy
east coast swing is literally like 5-6 steps, lindy hop is............ actually a bit more complex but it has a lot of hopping around and spinning
Andrew: ああ、今あなたのメッセージを見た。
Andrew: すみません
Andrew: 然し僕は日本語なら上手じゃないから、手伝うことができるかどうか知らない。
Andrew: https://www.cosplayfu.com/product/Ryoma+Wig+from+Fire+Emblem+Fates something about this is off
Nokri (Marisa): Where does Andru live again
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): How big of a detour is my house? BoJo might be working tomorrow, she’s willing to stay home or come back to take me to andru’s but then she has to work a lot more on Friday, and 12 to 1 is a long timeframe so if she does work then you might be waiting at andru’s for a while
Nokri (Marisa): I’m really sorry for causing trouble 
This is why I wanted to talk about it beforehand ;u;
Bill: It's just the kinda back and forth thing. It's like an extra half hour all in all. It's fine if it's not possible though. Also possible Andrew can come to you. I can give you a more exact time when I leave tomorrow.
Nokri (Marisa): could you go to andru first? does that make it shorter, since i'm further south?
Bill: longer actually. By like a mile.
Nokri (Marisa): also if andru came here he'd need to apply for several overnight parking passes for his car
Nokri (Marisa): oo
Nokri (Marisa): im sorry ahh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what if Andrew picks Marisa up and take her back to his place and Bill can pick both up there?
Bill: Ye there are still ways to make it work, need Andrew to be awake tho.
Nokri (Marisa): that's viable if andru can do it
Nokri (Marisa): im really sorry
Bill: Stop apologizing.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): What about park and rides
Bill: That would get complicated, I'd rather take the 30 minutes extra.
Nokri (Marisa): omg y'all don't forget your badges
Aldus Larian (Jess): mines at the con <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): whaaa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I got a 2-day badge. those don't get mailed
Aldus Larian (Jess): we didnt register in time for mail
Nokri (Marisa): oo
ooo
Nokri (Marisa): jess and tom are you guys picking up your badge thursday or friday?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ugh I'm gonna try to leave by 7am on Saturday which means I have to be up before 6
Aldus Larian (Jess): try for Thursday
Aldus Larian (Jess): reg closes at 10
Nokri (Marisa): andru awake <:rise:582318089228648456>
Andrew: Am now
Andrew: I can pick you up and bring you here
Nokri (Marisa): bless
Nokri (Marisa): what time would that be
Andrew: Whatever time it needs to be, what time is bill coming?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That Shane photographer actually got a permit from Rutgers to shoot there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow the amount of times I’ve just said “fuck it”
Bill: between noon and 12:30 probably.
Andrew: <@!301927856240459777> Is 11am ok to get you then?
Nokri (Marisa): Yes I would be very grateful <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Nokri (Marisa): My address is 234 not 324 tho like Biru had
Andrew: Ok, though I know where it is already so were good.
Andrew: I decided to bring full armor ryoma
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ooh Zen wog (minus tail) came in today
Bill: Kaminari pants come.
Bill: Friday.
Bill: Woo.
Andrew: Fire emblem comes out. Friday. Woo.
Andrew: I wont be able to play until sunday 😦
Bill: You buy already?
Bill: Also none of us will be playing.
Andrew: No
Andrew: Limited edition didnt interest me
Andrew: Was debating trying to get it down there but theres nowhere near the con center to buy it.
Bill: You and Marisa both prefer physical copies right?
Andrew: Yes. You dont own a digital game.
Bill: True, but fuck cartridges.
Andrew: I cant say that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@184437198865563648>  do we have a fridge and microwave do u know?
Bill: I see mini fridge listed on the site.
Bill: No microwave listed.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok thanks
Nokri (Marisa): We can use the iron, coffee maker, and hair dryer instead. Plus I’ll bring my hair straightener
Bill: I hate driving to DC man.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is anyone bringing water?
Tikur (Kurtis): Yes
Tikur (Kurtis): I'm driving a case tonight
Bill: *Marisa srsly. If you take fault for every complaint I make, which has nothing to do with you, I can’t vent without feeling guilty.*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok coo
Nokri (Marisa): every complaint is my fault sorry
Bill: It’s not.
Tikur (Kurtis): So I'm grabbing the strawberry wine. What else should I grab you think?
Nokri (Marisa): Some handcuffs because jail
Tikur (Kurtis): Understood
Tikur (Kurtis): Grabbing a Riesling unless there are objections
Bill: 👌🏻
Nokri (Marisa): I hope that’s a brand of fancy water
Tikur (Kurtis): It's fancy water with grapes
Andrew: Any suggestions on food/snacks we need
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm gud
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Riesling and hand cuffs nice
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Sounds like a good time
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Although no drinking, drinking is bad
El🆓de Faun (Tom): No hydration, only food
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Dehydrated food
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👀
Nokri (Marisa): it feels weird being mostly packed up. what am i missing.
Nokri (Marisa): what crucial element will i scramble to make 5 minutes before andru arrives tomorrow
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Nokri (Marisa): i can't find my book for chise. i have the canon picture book from the OVA but i can't remember where i put it, and the only use it really has is pictures so it's not important
