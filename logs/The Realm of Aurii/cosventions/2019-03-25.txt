Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Neat, might take you up on that sometime. I really don't know much about photography but I'd love to take photos of people's cosplays and do cool in-character edits for them.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I just realized zenkais gonna clash with my niece's birthday weekend if it keeps being this weekend every year 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bring niece to zenkai problem solved
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cosplay baby
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Cosplay a character with a baby
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): use baby as prop
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do they make wigs in baby size?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Most really young kids have fabric wigs
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa guess I gotta step up my game
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ugh I'm looking for coats for Zen and I found the perfect one on Amazon, but it doesn't come in white
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://smile.amazon.com/MAOWAO-Trench-Mid-Long-Windbreaker-Breasted/dp/B07JW72MLY/ref=sr_1_63?keywords=white+trench+coat&qid=1553479783&s=apparel&sr=1-63

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): okay found some reviews that say they're awful lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh nuuuu!

N🆗ri (Marisa): If the seller has good ratings I’d say Aliexpress is good
N🆗ri (Marisa): Got 3 packages from it in the mailbox today <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Important thoughts
Bill: Oh. We did the group shoot for RWBY and I realized I should have been in that. Two days later.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <@!184437198865563648> i can try and work with the wig you have right now, but if it's too jacked up you might have to end up getting a new one
Bill: I could care less about getting a new one. Lit just bill me for whatever you need to make good wog.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LmAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean alright, if you ok with that. I won't go ham or anything.
Bill: I won’t bat an eye at anything under 60 tbh.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ok fam, it def wont even be that much at all xD so we good
Bill: I’m like Richard gere in pretty woman but instead of paying to pretty up a fake girlfriend imma just get pretty myself.
Bill: Montage coming for vlog footage.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fuck yea i love makeover montages
Bill: Was that a make over? Or rather; does clothing montage count?
Bill: Oh probably.
Bill: For some reason I thought makeup specifically.
Bill: And now I’m just thinking princess diaries.
Bill: All the boy moose gunna go waaaaah
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its like queer eye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Cos Eye for the Creatively Inept Guy* starring Lipstick Giraffe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): PERFECT
Bill: *Are you calling me inept B O I*
Bill: Also I'm good with paying you for your time too. I know you have lots to do for yourself so taking up your time is valuable. 🙏
Bill: If I get the energy I should make an event for Next's RWBY shoot.
Bill: It doesn't exist.
Aldus Larian (Jess): do it
Aldus Larian (Jess): im actually getting post con blues wtf feel like its been awhile since that happened XD
Bill: Zenkai was legitimately fun.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i had a really good time
N🆗ri (Marisa): Idkfkdosicuus it morn
Zenkai wasn’t fun for a lot of staff because they were short handed and they’re making more cuts to the staff for next year
We’ve never worked that hard before. Usually we get more breaks, we can attend panels and actually do stuff, but nope this year was all shouting and gettin worked to the bone

But it’s awesome you guys enjoyed it because that’s the reason we work <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: =/
N🆗ri (Marisa): The con chair lied to BoJo and that’s why she was really mad yesterday. We know she lied because she was talking about something BoJo and I were running and I found out the chair is the reason my line was a huge out of control mess that wouldn’t listen
Bill: Apparently chair was yelling at a disabled person?
Bill: Did you say that or Hunter.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Didn’t hear it from me
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~I’m the person not included in the other group chat aren’t I oof~~
Bill: No, Hunter said it in person.
Bill: In what world would *I* ever be in a group chat with Hunter?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Am still a little peeved he totally ignored me <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Bill: Should be.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Multiple times <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Bill: But it his loss to not have BEST GURL Mawisa in his laifu.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone was also spreading rumors the water was spiked with hydrogen peroxide. That’s a lie. We’d have noticed if someone was right next to us unscrewing the water lid and dumping something inside. They just weren’t cleaned properly from the last use.
Aldus Larian (Jess): what did the con chair lie about 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~sorry for ruining the flow of conversation here y’all can keep conversing what you were before~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): The dealers hall line on Friday that wrapped around to registration and back up the stairs, causing a huge safety hazard
N🆗ri (Marisa): And it was growing at such an extreme rate. A girl in a wheelchair might’ve gotten stuck because I was trying to wait for her to move before expanding the line but there were dozens of people coming over I had no choice but to continue it (she was talking to someone in line)
N🆗ri (Marisa): Con chair was saying the stairs were fine and she kept sending more people down and pushing them to the left when I was trying to stop people coming down and move them to the right because it was my line and no one could get to registration if they were lining up on the left
Aldus Larian (Jess): im sorry you were overworked marisa! 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is not u fault, a lot of people are angry with how things were run this year
N🆗ri (Marisa): In past years I had a lot more free time
Bill: tldr new con chair is a beyotch.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that was really confusing witht he line! cuz we were trying to get down to the reg lare friday and thats when bojo and the other girl (idk her name) that was working the line stopped us and i felt really bad cuz i was just out of it and was not paying attnentiona nd just following biru
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooooh nooooo yeah
That’s the issue there
What did the other girl look like?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yoju took a selfie with her! it was on facebook i liked it
Aldus Larian (Jess): she was nice i just just felt bad for not paying attention
Aldus Larian (Jess): we missed you alot with you on staff!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooo Leandra! Ye she’s on our team. Wow she was assigned the door duty so if she left her post to help the line then it really was all hands on deck. We had at least 4 security teams trying to control the line because at one point I couldn’t handle it and radio’d for backup after running upstairs 3 times to ask for help
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nah I’d hold u guys back. Y’all were able to have fun! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): that line was nuts
Aldus Larian (Jess): MARISA U ARE FUN
Bill: Stop saying stuff like that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I MISSED U SO MUCH ❤
N🆗ri (Marisa): Eat ur soup
Bill: EAT YOUR RICE KRISPIES
N🆗ri (Marisa): EAT UR RICE KRISPEYEAH
Bill: I MEAN YOU MARISA
Aldus Larian (Jess): that soup was really good actually thank u for bringing it to me i hope u ate
Aldus Larian (Jess): i saw u with a sandwish, i hope u ate it and didnt give it away
N🆗ri (Marisa): I got Lanie a sandwich because she was so busy she couldn’t go get food and it disappeared before she ate it lol what happened to her sandwich like did an attendee take it or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): MARISA did u eat all weekend? D:
N🆗ri (Marisa): Eating all weekend would be unprofessional <:woah:543194447345876998>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Meg gave me a knitted heart though!! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): did u consume any food over the course of the weekend?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Cookie <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa PLZ
Bill: *Oh, is Marisa not eating again*
N🆗ri (Marisa): We also made out with 288 golf pencils were loaded for life now <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): WE GOT DOMINOS LAST NIGHT DONT U DARE
Bill: See?
Bill: She ate.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I feel really bad for meg
Bill: why?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Something happened after the masquerade let me pet Sylvia and I’ll explain but u gotta keep it hush hush
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :(
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oki so did you see her Saturday cosplay? It was ralsei and it was fantastic
Bill: I has photos.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah and her asriel was good too
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it has custom-made underwear! and it lights up! and transforms!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): she spent hundreds of dollars and hours on it
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's also rather hot and hard to see and she has to wear a binder
Elfriede Faun (Tom): FANCY
N🆗ri (Marisa): and the masquerade is pretty nerve-wracking especially since they were up first in the hall contest. so after the masquerade when they went to leave Meg got really sick and threw up on herself (tried to get it into a trash can). She got some of it on her outfit but I think it can be repaired. 
an EMT wheeled her over to the elevators which is where I saw her and Flora. meg hadn't eaten all day and was tired and unwell and just wanted to get out of the costume, or at least step outside for some fresh air but the EMT kept nagging her and asking her questions. i guess the EMT thought she was drunk or on drugs, which she was neither. she just wanted to leave so finally they let her go, and then on the elevator ride up it was jam-packed and this one guy kept making sardine jokes while Meg was suffering and nauseous in the corner
they made it up ok and she was better in the morning but man what a sucky saturday
Bill: 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no! 😦
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think the most annoying part was the EMT who kept asking if she was drunk/on drugs. meg doesn't do drugs and she certainly doesn't get drunk before going up on stage, and the guy didn't seem to believe her
N🆗ri (Marisa): i guess he's never spent a prolonged amount of time in a furry costume
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahhh..
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea they assume young person at event means drunk or on drugs
Elfriede Faun (Tom): There def was some super high girls outside sat night but
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT
Elfriede Faun (Tom): There prob was plenty of drunk and high people so I get it but
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was fucked
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They were shot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Idk how they were functioning
Aldus Larian (Jess): and that was def not just drunk
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They shook my spear and hugged me when I looked annoyed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): While we were waiting to pack the car
Aldus Larian (Jess): def smelt weed out there too
N🆗ri (Marisa): noooooooooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): I hope meg feels better now D:
N🆗ri (Marisa): she does! i hope she can fix the costume. in the moment she was really disheartened but i couldn't even tell so it should be salvageable
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hope so! 🙏
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do any of you follow amaranthinebunny?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think i do
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont social-media-ly follow her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but mentally i follow her cause ive heard some tea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because she too is Mystic Messenger trash. She commented on my story I shared from Jess lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah sakura san was complainin about her like last june about some drama with private shoots
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol i looked her um and that was the first thing i saw
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If you stealthily scroll through her posts back to 2016 she did a lot of MM cosplays and they were really good
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea im scrolling down
Aldus Larian (Jess): she has lotsa zenxmc das cute
Aldus Larian (Jess): and a whole squad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah Zen's her favorite
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But she did a Jumin costest which looked really good too
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i saw that
Andrew: I didnt really encounter the staff too much cuz i did a lot of wandering not really doing much persay but i didnt see anything particualrly bad, but i heard all the stories about the staff on the group page
N🆗ri (Marisa): share stories
Andrew: But the Micaela line yesterday was actually made fun because of Bojo
Andrew: i heard the girls behind us say they really liked her and she made the time go buy a little faster with her stories
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): when do the survey get sent out
Andrew: But <@!301927856240459777> mostly about the yelling at a disabled person and conflicting staff directions and some overall rudeness
Andrew: not staff thing but apperently someone threw pasta at someone and trash was a huge problem
N🆗ri (Marisa): pasta?/?///???
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i had nothin but good experiences with staff
Aldus Larian (Jess): ya bojo worked so hard all weekend and is super energetic and manages to be friendly/funny while still keeping things in order
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _except penny_
Andrew: Yea i had no problems with satff
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea all staff was v. nice ~~even when i was being a bad bean~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's usually a thing for feedback on the forums but i don't see it up right now
penny looked really bad this year i was shocked
N🆗ri (Marisa): *jess u were an angel*
Aldus Larian (Jess): like i was standing in a window which i knew was prob not ok and the lady came over and was like "im really sorry but you cant stand up there"
Aldus Larian (Jess): only rude staff was hotel staff office admin dude who didnt want people taking pics by his office
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye we wanna stand in windows too but that's a venue thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): what is he hiding what are his secrets
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): did you hear anything about the con switching venues or moving back to april
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i figured, no biggie all con staff was good!
Andrew: we had a lady tell us we had to wrap up our FE shoot cuz it was LARP space which is perfectly fgair
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause honestlyyy that place felt cramped
Andrew: b ut like there was literally noone in the hall or the larp room
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think it felt cramped cuz no lobby
Andrew: and no outside ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Andrew: go back to maaay
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you fill out the feedback forms could you mention Joy or like "the blonde woman in a yellow shirt and green bandana by the dealers room" because the reason she was crying yesterday is Tim chewed her out because one single person complained that she was mean and yelling at him and they really put her down over that one complaint
N🆗ri (Marisa): no info about venue change womp womp. i wish they'd move to a new venue.
Andrew: people on the FB page said the marriot may kick it out becaus eof the litter, or ban food outside the restaurant
Andrew: wwhich is utterly ridiculous
N🆗ri (Marisa): the litter was the hotel's problem, they didn't clean the trash cans enough
Andrew: im trying to find the lanacaster paper to see if we were put in
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i wanna see if im in the paper
Andrew: nothing on lancaster online
Andrew: let us know if someone sees the feedback up
Aldus Larian (Jess): over one complaint?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo the guy who took your photograph was a real journalist but we had issues this weekend with creepy dudes with camera having fake press ribbons/credentials taking pictures of girls
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats bs! tell her i thought she did a great job!
Aldus Larian (Jess): you did good job too marisa!
N🆗ri (Marisa): no i danced in place a lot and was in a panic 95% of the time
Aldus Larian (Jess): aww!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://lancasteronline.com/features/zenkaikon-cosplay-convention-kicks-off-in-downtown-lancaster-photos-video/article_a697edb4-4cc4-11e9-8cd7-c720c744b519.html
Andrew: it sucks that that was happening moree than a couple times
Aldus Larian (Jess): bojo is loud thats prob why the guy thought he was getting "yelled at" but like with the jobs they have her doing the only way to get stuff done is to have someone who is loud
N🆗ri (Marisa): "lucky 13" lol i think they got things mixed up
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's exactly it. i always think she's yelling at me at home when she's like "CAN YOU PASS ME A GATORADE" but she's just very outspoken and has a loud voice.
Andrew: lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kirsten in the paper!
Andrew: Nice!
Andrew: but rip i didnt make it in
Andrew: i thought we were pretty good
N🆗ri (Marisa): yuuki cross is my favorite spiderman
N🆗ri (Marisa): u were best
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA like the reason she keeps the line sin order is cuz shes loud they should have expected her to get a compliant or two just becasue people dont like being told what to do
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "are you penni from spiderverse?" 

"will i... be in the paper if i am?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's exactly the reason!!! she's not even on the line team. she's the reason we have a dedicated team for lines, but there's only 2 people on that team and we have many lines
Andrew: in my line Bojo was very clear and loud enough for everyone to know what was going on
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): my review will be
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): good staff: kiwi, bojo, ESPECIALLY MARISA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): bad: penny
Andrew: at the end of the line with the cards they gave out she was trying to get the last few people them by asking wif people were just there to hang with other people
Bill: who the hell is Penny.
Andrew: and she got them cards
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah who penny
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): formal lady
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE formal lady
Bill: I saw Kiwi again with Marisa I'm pretty sure she was *literally* doing a favor for Hunter so. Don't count her as a great human yet.
Andrew: she was like "who ios here and has no clue who micaela is"
Bill: I will absolutely write to say how great Bojo is.
Bill: March is confirmed for next year, probably same venue. Some space concerns should be alleviated by the lobby being back and the expansion.
Andrew: people will have a relaxing area
N🆗ri (Marisa): kiwi said the RWBY shoot was a favor for a friend so it's 100% a favor for hunter. she wouldn't of tolerated it otherwise. kiwi is great but she's also very intense and usually stays in the safety office because when she talks it sounds like she's angry yelling, but she's perfect for safety because she gets things done
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oof nvm no mention of her then
Bill: Yes, that little miracle isn't happening again next year.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): could we suggest them having like... a panel room to set up as meeting spaces?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause changing the con to march really shot meet ups in the foot
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah we've gotten lots of requests for that and I think it was supposed to be a thing. idk what happened to it but definitely request that
Bill: Let's also keep in mind new con chair is apparently super unorganized.
Bill: whole con was a mess this year right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yyyyeahhh. people weren't very please with how thing were this year.
N🆗ri (Marisa): lots of stuff was late
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): game room looked more empty...
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH TEH GAME ROOM WAS TRASH THIS YEAR WHAT HAPPENED
Aldus Larian (Jess): every time i exited the dealers hall there was a nice girl who said Hi to me and hung out with me and asked if i had eaten and complimented me
Aldus Larian (Jess): 10/10
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow who is she
Bill: I LOVE THAT GIRL
Andrew: they switched vendors for the game room,
Aldus Larian (Jess): best girl
Andrew: the new vendor is supposed to be more epsorts/competetive focused
N🆗ri (Marisa): the issue is that our board of directors aren't thinking from an attendee viewpoint anymore. they're cooped up in their office and are only thinking from a logistics standpoint and are alienated from how things actually are
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ew
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im gonna have some WORDS for the survey
Andrew: thats what a guy named chet was saying
N🆗ri (Marisa): we tell them "we should do this for next year" and they go "no... we do this instead it's more cost effective" and we're like "nO!! that's not how people act!! that's gonna be a mess!"
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg bojo hates chet lol
Andrew: in the autograph line
N🆗ri (Marisa): they just clash heads lol
Andrew: i tried to ask him about the pricing for micaela and hes like "if you just want a  personal item its fre and we dont need to talk more" and kinda turned away
Andrew: also about the game room it was literally just a room with tvcs and consoles
Andrew: no projector or nothing so people coiuld see a thing, instead everyone clogged the corners and nobody could move and the tourney ran until like 2am
Andrew: but chet was saying that the board doesnt think like the antendees do
Andrew: and that it was a problem
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah andrew (Other Andrew <:lenny:395307171539189760> ) was there but he wasn't in charge of the video game room for some reason. that's probably a part of all the budget cuts they're doing for no reason.
Aldus Larian (Jess): how was the masquerade? i think i might wanna check that out next time
N🆗ri (Marisa): IT WAS GREAT OMG
N🆗ri (Marisa): it ran way over time though so they cut off the amv showcase and breezed through awards rapidly
N🆗ri (Marisa): i liked the emcees and the acts were great
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have blurry cell phone video of meg and flora
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaa i shoulda went with u! i think i was distracted by propect of ood

N🆗ri (Marisa): there were many lsoh cosplays this weekend it was nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): and they did the song during the masq
and that chobits bit was amazing omg i want to watch that again
N🆗ri (Marisa): they didn't have the dance troupe that usually comes but that's ok because they're at every masq now
Andrew: Let's do a yona performance at a masquerade
Andrew: Totes
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH LETS DO IT
N🆗ri (Marisa): We have an idea for a mystic mess one already we gotta come up with Yona one

Andrew: was gonna make an FB page then go from there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye make the fb event first
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then when you submit i believe you can link the con peeps to the event
N🆗ri (Marisa): Check their website for a sign up sheet or follow social media

Andrew: can i change host later to that p[age?
Andrew: its not ready yet
Bill: You can add a host.
Andrew: i haver a skeleton for it rn
Andrew: ok
Andrew: will do later
Bill: But also Facebook is pretty shit for cosplay stuff.
Bill: So it's kinda wasted effort.
Bill: The entire community on Instagram.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg i could cosplay suyaris but *no one knows her*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow flora is so animated and lively normally but she looks so calm and tranquil in that pic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): nice posing
Aldus Larian (Jess): flora always looks amazing
Bill: ~~there's the anonymity from a cosplay page but you don't have stalkers so~~
Bill: All her.
Bill: I dialed in that shoot cause I wasn't really hype for it and everyone went on ahead. I like Flora, but not like ditching everyone for her.
Andrew: https://www.facebook.com/events/1284091351747654/
Bill: but also she tried to find poses and found *nothing* cause this character as background character as Pilot Boi so.
Bill: *3 to 6*?
N🆗ri (Marisa): many fire emblems
Andrew: Time TBD in description
Andrew: fixed for Billiam
N🆗ri (Marisa): am really considering suyaris. it'd be super comfy, fun to work on, and i just realized how detailed the art was in early chapters wow. now it's more meme-y
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): we all smackin interested so animenext knows youre a force to be reckoned with
Andrew: thanks
Andrew: kansha
Andrew: looking on the anext website for registratioins for shoots
N🆗ri (Marisa): ああそういえば、いつ日本語のチャンネルを作るつもり？
Andrew: waaiiit
Andrew: gimme a sec
Andrew: marisa
Bill: Officially registering is a butt.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she slouch it perf
Bill: I copy pasted the rwby shoot together again, Saturday at 2 as per tradition?
Bill: Probably.
Andrew: gotta work around that
Bill: If you want me to come to FE ye. You can add me as a cohost if you want to.
Andrew: sure
Andrew: added peter cuz hje wanted to help
Bill: It worth fri/sat for RWBY? Probably not.
Andrew: またまたパソコンで日本語を作れる！
Bill: Anyone got thoughts on fri/sat?
Aldus Larian (Jess): prob not rwbying
Aldus Larian (Jess): im kinda done with rwby for while i think
Bill: 
Andrew: 日本語キーボードをインストールしちゃった
N🆗ri (Marisa): that was fast lol
Bill: yeah really.
Andrew: loool
N🆗ri (Marisa): いいね。怠け者だからググるを使うww
Andrew: she ent to ge tmy picture with john and she lkooked at me for a second and wa slike "Andrew right"
N🆗ri (Marisa): suyaris. nene. capri. all super obscure ~~until nene gets her anime soon.~~
idk hmm. maybe there's a character i already cosplay that has a fancy form i could try.
Bill: ^
Bill: That a good idea.
Bill: Ladybug?
Bill: Even if rwby is more of a friday or saturday mood Jess. BNHA shoots tend to lean friday I feel like, so saturday is good to be rwby?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ladybug only has her swim form though right? that's not too difficult
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If I go to Anext I’d prob wooby on Saturday
Bill: Eh. Tradition.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not that that makes much sway lol
Bill: Is more just picking which day with no one to actually pick it for. Usually I'd decide based on friend's schedules.
Bill: I'll add you as cohost if you confirm next down the line~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 😊🙏
Andrew: did my event share to you all?
Andrew: i can barely navigate to it on FB
Andrew: oh wait
Andrew: sharing it now
Bill: Make sure to blast to the Animenext facebook groups.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll share to my IG laterz
Bill: ~~Do I host Nier so you guys can show off your weapons Tom/Jess?~~
Andrew: I gotta finish uploading pics to IG
Andrew: that rave pic of us Bill is great but we look so sweaty XD
Bill: You shared to your wall Andrew, but also share to Animenext and Animenext Photography.
Andrew: also trying to find who has the photos for our FE shoot
Andrew: i dont have their info
Andrew: i shared to Anext now
Andrew: let me do the photography page
Bill: You are in both groups and already shared to the Animenext group lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dun know D: i dnt plan line ups this far in advance. if we go to geekdom im not doing 2b at next tho prob
Andrew: shjare dto both
Bill: Good. now just wait.
Bill: NBD Jess.
Bill: I wouldn't mind running it for like friday afternoon.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im def sticking with 1 cosplay a day
Aldus Larian (Jess): i feel like i dont get to enjoy the con with trying to get pics, shop, eat, talk to friends, and then adding costume changes ontop of that
Bill: Valid. It was kinda annoying for the saturday I did it.
Bill: But I *wanted* out of pilot boi cause leather.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i end up spending too much time in the room or just maneuvering around and we go to enough cons theres no reason i should try to pack 2-3 costumes in a day
Aldus Larian (Jess): if i chnge itll be just o be more comfy/casual later at night
Bill: and more walk around time!
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: Ye. I just say afternoon cause better than noon light and not getting up early lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): i always think i have so much time but by the time i get ready its like already 11 or 12 XD
Bill: Yeeee
Bill: So don’t want to do it too early. Guy just tagged someone and that’s it as a post in the RWBY shoot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't think of anything for the contest and the more i think the more i remember how unpleasant katsu was so maybe i'll interpret
Bill: Nooooooo cosplay groups with ussss
N🆗ri (Marisa): but what charas do you need :0
Bill: Dunno yet.
Bill: ~~Inb4 the people from last year message me about the shoot and I just die~~
Bill: ~~also thanks for the nothing BNE~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo what they do
N🆗ri (Marisa): or in this case not do
Andrew: 
Bill: Swarm the event with interested.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooOOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt get notifs for either 😮
Bill: I share the link.
Bill: I guess I'll do invite spam.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no that fine, in bne?
Bill: mm.
Bill: eh. I feel weird inviting people I know won't go so I guess I'll leave it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok i put intersted for u both but its unlikely i am actually coming to either  😬
Bill: ~~half the people who mark interested don't come to events~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm a big fat phony
Bill: I just want it have a dozen people already when people see it on the facebook groups.
Bill: Makes it look more credible.
Andrew: especially if we have to register with the con
Bill: only if you want one of the official spots...
Bill: Are they still doing that?
Bill: Cause it was terrible.
N🆗ri (Marisa): andru where did that screenshot come from what group
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I posted to Instagram so at least a handful should roll in from that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Though as we pointed out those rwbys... I have never seen them before
Andrew: Zenkaikon Community - Official
Bill: That's how Next goes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): サンキュー
Bill: *oh good* Hunter is going.
Bill: Sigh. Regrets.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Marking interested doesn’t mean much
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal marked interested in the Zenkai RWBY shoot 😏
Bill: Oh no, he's going.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he prob wont show up
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lets be real
Bill: Nor will he show up.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^^^
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've decided i don't like sean very much <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sean Meehan?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whos sean
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh
Andrew: who is he?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea hes ...something
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That endeavor/Pokémon guy
Bill: But I say that cause it's not the usual crowd, no one's interested in the friend group (outside of Georgia whose iffy) and that's a little stressful.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i group him with DJ, and the two GB coco adels
Bill: Sean kinda off ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he makes me uncomfortable
N🆗ri (Marisa): last i ran into him he determined I was incredibly drunk, scolded me for not going to his hentai panel that he invited me to, and then told me all about what i missed at the hentai panel.
not a bad person just not the kind of person i enjoy
Aldus Larian (Jess): LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh yeah he’s always like COME TO MY PANEL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he makes the pick up line jokes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s harmless but I’m not happy to see him really
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao yea marisa, drunk, at a hentai panel
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats funny
Andrew: lol
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Andrew: ^]
N🆗ri (Marisa): *very explicit details about the hentai panel*
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's me the drunk at the hentai panel
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats the the furthest thing from anything you'd be interested in
N🆗ri (Marisa): he was like "how drunk are you right now" and i made that sound i make when answering 90% of questions and he goes "haha wow had quite a few drinks huh? surprisingly i'm still sober" and i was like <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: <@!184437198865563648> was he the guyy we met in the elevator
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Bill: Uhhh
Bill: You'd know him if you saw him.
Bill: Giovanni.
Andrew: he had the endeavor with the fire mask?
Aldus Larian (Jess): of i was there i would have died laughing
Andrew: yep
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee that was him
Andrew: thta was him
Andrew: he told uss to come
N🆗ri (Marisa): so did you go
Andrew: no
Andrew: this was after rave
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think maybe some of the safety staff were mean-ish/intimidating because kiwi speaks to us like that and maybe they were trying to mimic her style? since she seems so in charge. that's how you run a tight ship and keep the workers in line but that's not how you speak to paying attendees.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know one guy i was working with was a bit of a pain. didn't have his staff shirt, insisted on personally screening every single person who went into the dealer's hall even though we were supposed to split the crowd so he'd stop people that i had already cleared to go in, and he'd slow things down so there was traffic during highly congested times
N🆗ri (Marisa): and he'd be like "you have to stop and show me your badge" and i'd be like "*i already saw their badge don't stop them omg we have 50 more people to check*"
Andrew: so is till want to do Kija for Yona
Andrew: Will prob buy it so i can focus on doing the wig and doing body paint for his arm
Andrew: and makeup and what not
Aldus Larian (Jess): we didnt get a big 3 selfie! D:
Bill: Flora said she'd still be down for that shoot!
Bill: But also sad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea the timing just wanst good D:
Aldus Larian (Jess): then we split up for food
Bill: I'm glad we skipped it, it fine.
Bill: I bought the stupid wig so I'd look *good* next to you guys and I really didn't so.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you get good wog then we shoot
N🆗ri (Marisa): u look fab tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): i might wanna get the other school uniform top too if i can find
Bill: I never do, but the wig for V was good and that heeeelped.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WUT
Aldus Larian (Jess): biru no
Aldus Larian (Jess): did anyone stop us as big three
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont remember

N🆗ri (Marisa): wow what a good 707!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): RIGHT?!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:huh:555585958146473984>
N🆗ri (Marisa): HOW WAS KEIKANCON
Bill: Oh though I’m not trying to rush planning if there a plan for Next/CPAC I’m in I’d be in for buying a Zeikani shoot.
