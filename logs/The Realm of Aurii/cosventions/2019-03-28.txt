N🆗ri (Marisa): do you guys plan to get to otakon as late as you got to zenkai? like, half day work?
because $13 badge delivery fee oof
Bill: Yeah pretty much.
Bill: Oh wait not.
Bill: Like Katsu.
Bill: SO like, 6 or 7 probably.
N🆗ri (Marisa): so might as well get the badge early
Bill: Yeee
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank!
N🆗ri (Marisa): if y'all haven't you should get your otakon badges soon. rate goes up either april 15th or when 10,000 people register, whichever comes first
Bill: Oh shit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): aww but if you guys go down late you can't visit the smithsonian!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): currently $98
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH
I'm going through my old e-mails trying to find my otakorp membership number
Remember when Otakon put one of those monthly box services out of business??? omg that was insane
N🆗ri (Marisa): can't find my membership number but last time i entered the hcc there was 2014 wew
N🆗ri (Marisa): srtdfgkjtere the omakase box debacle was in 2012? dang
N🆗ri (Marisa): if anyone didn't go to otakon in 2012, what happened is basically:
with every badge purchase, attendees also got a free one-month subscription to something called the "Omakase Box" as long as they paid shipping. It was one of those monthly random boxes with anime merch in it, and it came with a poor quality online streaming service for some newer anime like Fate/Zero. Of course everyone signed up, and then cancelled before the subscription renewed for the next month for like $30 or something. The Omakase Box company was relatively new, this was only their 3rd or 4th month in operation. The huge surge of new users for free from Otakon followed by the en masse cancellation of all those subscriptions financially ruined them and put them out of business for good lol rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): the box was pretty decent though it had a bunch of naruto merch and the box itself was nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait no. it was 2016. omakase box must've went out of business twice because their twitter says they stopped operating in 2012.
and it wasn't "buy an otakon badge get an omakase subscription free" - it was "buy a subscription to omakase for $30 and get an otakon badge for free" so of course everyone jumped on it asap
my bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rmid4krd6gtmeh2/AACIm1cj9LTsEx6S6VwxetUAa?dl=0
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): rebecca sent me my todobaku pics
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): in case anyone wanted to check em out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think her photography is gettin better
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't believe they put u in a trash can
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he did
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): not even recycling
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the photos still dark but other than that theyre pretty lit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): pun intended
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oooh those ate actually pretty good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But yeah needs to work on lighting a bit
Bill: She’s gone from over exposed to underexposed but under is the way to be so. She’s not seeing the light on people, which is a skill to learn. She took a page outta Marisa’s book with saturation and it’s a bittt much for my taste (I can tell she did it) but personal preference there.
Bill: Like she shouldn’t have shot in the underpass area. Not enough light.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah the first three are pretty well lit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It looks like it got dark WHILE you were shooting
Bill: Is a different spot. Best light is the solos at the end.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And she was trying to work with how dim it was
Bill: She wasn’t adjusting her camera settings at all.
Bill: She dialed it in once (before we got there I think) and left it the same.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye this was like 3 pm lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): or maybe 5
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): not that late tho
Bill: 5 or 6.
Bill: She wasn’t adjusting for the light as she changed backdrops.
Bill: She probably dialed the light correctly in that first spot, but that didn’t transition to others.
Bill: Also matrix metering is weird, she should switch to center weighted cause you want to meter the face with portraits not the whole scene. That’s if she was using the camera meter at all.
Bill: She found a good spot, it had some natural softboxing to it... but red brick tends to make for weird light (I hate that about landcaster) so it may have fucked with readings.
Bill: I should really critique *her* not to you guys cause all of these things are things she could easily improve on but I wasn’t asked, not officially shown the photos, and while *I* think I’m at a higher level of photography than her I’m not going to go all senpai on her without prompting. She’s never given me the feeling she feels I am senpai so...
Bill: Sigh.
Bill: I wanna help herrrr but I don’t want to be arrogant about ittttt
Bill: ~~is that a Leo mood~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if she had lightroom she could probably fix most of those probs too
Bill: I’d have to see the unedited but even with photoshop she can make the changes required.
Bill: She has that iirc.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye photoshop changes everything
Bill: Though the blurb above was mostly for in camera technique.
Bill: I... could... open it up as I’d like her serious critique on a shoot of mine, and then offer the same to her. That’d give her the suggestion to ask for critique.
Bill: But I’d probably do that to BNE as a whole. Aaaaand that’d mean Hunter would be involved and  my money is on getting real defensive from his critiques.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~pro photographer hacks, invite your next client to meet you where her ex is moseying about~~
Bill: That’s him being a bad friend, not a bad photographer.
Bill: But this about Rebecca.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that was also kind of just timing because he was finishing up mine and Lissy's shoot so Meg and Hal were bound to be there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~then spend shoot time showing the client her exe's girlfriends pics~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): o h
Bill: You don’t advertise your open dislike of meg and Hal outside of Aurii. He couldn’t know.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he was like "LOOK AT THE BLUE" and i was like uh..............huh
Bill: *And better than talking to them isn’t it*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i only avoided talking to them cause of you billiam_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk hunter has a discrepancy between the professionalism he wants and being friends with people
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like rebecca for instance doesnt do any of that "waste my time" stuff when we're on the clock
Bill: Everything I type sounds snarky fuck.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lmao
Bill: Snarky at you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): less lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): well its like if i wanted to hang with hunter i wouldnt pay him for it lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk ill see his returns in a couple weeks but i feel like he started to just not really tr
Bill: More on the avoiding Hal and Meg. I ran interference cause I thought you’d appreciate it.
Bill: But anyway, I don’t want to make this about Hunter. Tomorrow I want to think of a way to open a channel for critique with Rebecca cause I’d like to see her improve. I just don’t want to be haughty about it.
Bill: May need you to like, talk about todobaku in bne to start it off.., gotta think.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): aye aye captain
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i know you sounded meh to the idea a while ago
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but a dual photography thing with rebecca might be interesting for the future too
Bill: Lol that was my idea Georgia.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o was it? i thought you said something about not liking that idea some months back
Bill: Dual shoots or doing a challenge where we shoot the same model, same place, for the same time and see what we get. There’s YouTube videos of photographers doing that. Each photographer picks a location, occasionally outfit.
Bill: I brought up maybe doing one with Zeikani months ago.
Bill: You probably mixing up that I wouldn’t pay 45 dollars for a shoot like the big three at ANYC.
Bill: I still wouldn’t pay 45 dollars I think... But the potential is there.
Bill: ~~if I’m going to be cosplaying I need some photographer whose work I like as much as my own~~
Bill: I thought months ago about setting up a photography focused discord or something... maybe I’ll have to revisit.
Bill: I also want to see how our second ring friends like Lissy, David, and Zeikani shoot.
Bill: Hmmm....
N🆗ri (Marisa): o has anyone considered going to shikkaricon? i was talking to their table for a while at zenkai. it's in philly in october. very smol by the sounds of it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): O I has not heard of that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have some examples of Lissy's photos! I know she's fairly new but she's got a pretty good eye for framing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: I had a dream where I was trying to remember the Pyrrha cosplayer who died we used to know, cause I missed them. 

Still Georgia.
Bill: Like I had just been talking to her and I was confused.
Bill: Hunter asked me for advice on what more he should to do to charge more for his shoots and I was like “you should get feedback from your friends and see what they say you could improve on” and he was like “nah boi I need more cool stuff”. Meanwhile in said dream we had literally talked about how he was inconsistent and slow to return things and I was trying to get him to ask Leanna so she could point it out.
Bill: ~~that’s reality and the dream though~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so has anyone decided what they're doing for Kogara?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): will prob try to match the group for kogara
Bill: what group.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if anyone does a group
Bill: lol mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like if they decide bnha or whatever
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): whomstever is going
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that was my plan as well
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): otherwise ill prob do catra again
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause easy and comf
Bill: Marisa is going to be a troll of some kind.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh is it homestuck weekend
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): rip
Bill: I don't think Georgia wants to relive the past so I'll just be Marisa.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also just bought my Sakura ticket
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh i should do that too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably will go cosplay-less or casual Kiri
Bill: to?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sakura
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe I'll see if my dad still has his Japanese regalia and if it'll fit me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): would it be disrespectful to wear that as Kiri?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think it’s okay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): As long as you’re like “HeY loOK AT my bAthRoBe”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not even sure what he has. I know he's got the wooden sandals
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH FUCK THAT CUTE PINK ONE WOULD WORK FOR OCHAKO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I liked that it was pink but I was like I don’t cosplay pink characters
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _but I do_
Bill: every Ochako except hero suit cause it *dumb*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sakura San is selling her Ochako hero suit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I hated the boots but I’d consider making my own anyways
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ve been thinkin bout it
Bill: don't both though?
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea i saw that
Aldus Larian (Jess): how much does she want?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She didn’t say
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I’d hate to message like hey I’m interested maybe and she be like 200 plz
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I want a hero suit for when squad hero suits up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmm her Ochako suit looks smol on her tho and I’m both taller and probably wider at some points
Aldus Larian (Jess): i would just ask and then if its too high just tell her nvm right away
Bill: Yes you are entirely a different build than her too.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not to be weird, but the crotch area on her looks....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): funky
Bill: asides from the fact the suit has a vagina slot...?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~its already an outside vagine suit, but it look exceptionally yonic~~
Bill: Just do Todo's hero suit in Genderbend.
Bill: Much less... stupid.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): are so fucking cute at todo, ~~and also he an actual good character~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TRU
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was gonna make a hero suit for Todo too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And yeah I always hated Ochakos weird crotch line
Bill: Fem it up with a skirt if you want, lots of people have. BUt Ochako has a shitty hero suit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Which hero costume are you gonna go with? Todoroki’s had the biggest overhaul
Bill: for winter?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the OG hero suit that no one talks about
Bill: NOW THAT'S the mistake Georgia should make.
Bill: Glue fucking ice to your face.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): White button down shirt, done
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O YA THAT TOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and red cyborg eye
N🆗ri (Marisa): Classic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Todo has seen better days
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I like how this fem todo does the top but I can’t really bring myself to agree with the ass-less skirt
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): It burned away
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): icy thot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Bill: Don't... do an assless skirt then?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): booty too hot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): could just do a regukar school skirt
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pleated
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): all the way around
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or you can do a cute short romper
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was thinkin that or shorts YEAH LIKE A ROMPER
N🆗ri (Marisa): Todoroki in a romper
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or maybe like Yang’s shorts and skirt combo
Bill: Todo's outfit is completely and utter 'this was the first thing in my closet on uniform day so I wore it'. So think of like, the most comfortable thing you could wear. Then that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hero suit Todo would be pretty sweet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m just smol sad about not being canon
Bill: ~~better female than the canon ones~~
Bill: *Unless you like 'fuck me deku-chan', 'My ass so thicc my books balance on it', 'tongue fetish' or 'pastel ~~goth~~ homestuck'.
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s gotta be a genderbend soon. All big series have an official genderbend.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe if horikoshi wasn’t so overworked it’d be out already
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean tsuyu is a pretty good female
Bill: I get he overworked but he writes the girls like shit.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Buuut yeah that’s like it
Bill: Yeah, I was going for the bit, Tsuyu actually does a few things.
Aldus Larian (Jess): HEY dont insult my pink homestuck
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess is a homestuck now? Blessed day.
Bill: Sorry, I took back the dig at Tsuyu but Mina does nothing in series. Which is sad, but fact.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s like a less screen time Denki
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Denki gets pretty shirked as comic relief
Bill: They both get no screen time.
Bill: Denki 👏 should 👏 be 👏 as 👏 busted 👏 as Todoroki 👏
Bill: Elemental control is no joke.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah tbh he should but he’s some dum~~my thicc~~b that he just doesn’t pull it off
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is big sad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _yo if we end up with my hero yukatas for Sakura Sunday, Bakugo yukata would be so funny <@!334090409389195266> _
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I found a cool thing on Amazon for Kiri but 1.) the design is Chinese and 2.) it's obviously just supposed to be a bathrobe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://smile.amazon.com/TLIH-Embroidered-Loungewear-Nightgown-Two-Side/dp/B01LXK9CE5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=dragon%2Byukata&qid=1553786724&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&th=1
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!301927856240459777>  would probably know better than most
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): finding actual yukata on amazon is proving to not be easy
N🆗ri (Marisa): hewwo owo
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's more chinese <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: *Marisa: Just make one silly*
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~my first thought was "do u guys need a pattern"~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I hear amazon japan actually has good shipping rates
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=%E6%B5%B4%E8%A1%A3+%E3%83%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BA&crid=F1SB25E9U2RF&sprefix=%E6%B5%B4%E8%A1%A3%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_ss_ime_c_1_2
N🆗ri (Marisa): not bad prices. 100 yen is about $1, just move the decimal over 2 places. so 5000 yen is $50
N🆗ri (Marisa): check the 'international shipping' on the left side tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Samurai Kiri?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): here are girl's yukata with the fake bow so you don't need to spend 5 hours tying the bow
https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=%E6%B5%B4%E8%A1%A3+%E3%83%AC%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9&crid=2ZS8TPST7S25X&sprefix=%E6%B5%B4%E8%A1%A3+%2Caps%2C232&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_3
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Are the short ones not appropriate?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): short yukata don't really exist in japan aside from idol concerts/harajuku street fashion
N🆗ri (Marisa): you could wear one! they're not not-appropriate, they're just not really common in japan outside of otaku communities
Aldus Larian (Jess): this is that i have:
https://www.miccostumes.com/nier-automata-2b-yorha-no-9-type-s-no.2-type-b-cosplay-costume_69652p.html
Aldus Larian (Jess): the short one, tom has the long one
Bill: and phili isn't japan, remember.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yike, $95 for that Hakama 😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye but I don’t wanna be disrespectful to a culture that isn’t mine 🙇‍♀️
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): DAYUM
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So short is ok tho that’s good
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is what i wore the last time i cosplayed to sakura sunday it was fine
Elfriede Faun (Tom): DAKURA MIKU WOO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!301927856240459777> what are other types of Japanes-wear for men? I know nothing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): plz educate
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
You've got hakama which are the pleated pants, 5 pleats in front and 2 in back
Happi which are coats people wear over yukata
Jinbei which are what people wore in the Edo period, it's what Haku and Chihiro wear
Suikan but those are *really* old, like 1000 years ago clothes
N🆗ri (Marisa): you could be a workman and wear those really baggy pants :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): there are also different types of yukata, like this is a ryokan yukata. you wouldn't wear this outside, it's essentially pajamas and you wear them at home or in hotels
https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A8%E3%83%84-%E6%97%85%E9%A4%A8%E6%B5%B4%E8%A1%A3-3%E7%82%B9%E3%82%BB%E3%83%83%E3%83%88-%E4%B8%B9%E5%89%8D%E5%B8%AF-%E3%83%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BA/dp/B00PRTMQ2Y/ref=sr_1_3?crid=F1SB25E9U2RF&keywords=%E6%B5%B4%E8%A1%A3+%E3%83%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BA&qid=1553787281&refinements=p_n_shipping_option-bin%3A2493950051&rnid=2493949051&s=gateway&sprefix=%E6%B5%B4%E8%A1%A3%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-3
N🆗ri (Marisa): these are more outdoors yukata
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): These jinbei are cool omg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They’re gender neutral?
N🆗ri (Marisa): you could go full yankee and wear a big floor-length leather coat and a mullet
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah jinbei are gender neutral but girls more commonly wore kimono
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg.....that would be hilarious
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): can we do a "yankee" group at some point LMAO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This looks like the eastern equivalent of guy fieri
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): guy fieri
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LMAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I like the happi
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I should say finding a yukata *specifically for me* is difficult because they're all gonna be too short on me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably will just do casual Kiri with the UA hoodie
Bill: I don't think you guys have to stress being disrespectful tooo much. Like, bathrobes no, but putting in effort to be in japanese style clothingg is respectful by nature.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tom and Jess are doin yukata 2B and nines
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Leanna and Mawisa wot you doin
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): haku and chihiro
Bill: Ghibli ye.

Aldus Larian (Jess): I wanna post my Lilith cosplay cuz borderlands hype but I don't really like the way that cosplay looks anymore and also I think I'm out of content for her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): how can I Up the light on this without killing it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Make it lighter, but not enough that it kills it ☝🏻
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _genius_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause i tried to lighten it but then all the colors mcdie
Bill: It’s a jpg?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): uhhhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i guesssss?
Bill: Look at the end of the file name.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye change the highlights but it look like webecca already changed the shadows
N🆗ri (Marisa): or. opposite. change shadows yeah but webecca already edited the highlights
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How you do that wit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hmmm even then my eye is so hidden
Bill: Raccoon eyes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): brush eyes with dodge tool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dodge tool?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Photoshop tool
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can do it if u want but i have a cat on me right now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): everybody post slightly different versions of georgia
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /posts a selfie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess my eye gets lost no matter what huh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooooo can i make u icy
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:woah:543194447345876998>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~ur eye was lost when ur mom burned it~~
Bill: Might look when I get on train, but Marisa better at post than me so it’s probably gone.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye go for it!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do I... ask rebecca if she can fix?
Bill: ~~whose the best photographer tho~~
Bill: No.
Bill: I’d find that a little off putting.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> you?
N🆗ri (Marisa): what happen
N🆗ri (Marisa): best photog you?
Bill: Would you find someone asking to edit again offputting?
Bill: Fuck I was supposed to do that whole thing about advising Rebecca today.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I kinda tried to find your eye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But it looks weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The first one was better
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's just the shadow of your wiggy boi
Bill: Yeah the eye is just a weird bright spot. Have to feather the brightening across the shadowed section.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So the blue doesnt show through enough
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Looks like I got a lazy eye
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooooooooohh. depends on the picture. If it's within reason I'll totally edit it again, I encourage people asking that because I don't wanna turn in pictures they don't like. otherwise though maybe slightly off putting a little
Bill: So it a tie Georgia. You could.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s mostly a brightness thing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t think that’s all too offensive?
Bill: Sometimes the darkness is intentional. ~~totally not here, it’s because she didn’t expose correctly~~
Bill: Ask nicely. Everyone loves you, doubt she’ll take it bad.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Now you can see your eyes
Bill: Got too caught up, forgot to buy ticket for ferry before getting to the guy.
Bill: People who hung with the squids, has Rebecca ever said anything regards to me as a photographer? If she thinks I’m the local “pro” I can just give her advice straight up... ~~wouldn’t be surprised if people also have an opinion I only shoot Georgia tom and Jess but~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Uuuhhh I don't recall
Bill: Damn.
Bill: Though I’m obviously overthinking this.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my photoshop crashed lol rip
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Without your eyes looking creepy this is the best I got xD as soon as I add any more light or color to the blue you look like you're a white Walker
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hard to tell but 
The original is a lot darker
Bill: 
Bill: I don’t think discord let me save full res to my tablet. Or I’m just really not used to editing non raw photos.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I downloaded it straight from the drop box
Bill: Oh smart.
Bill: I. Can’t be terribly bothered.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm procrastinating
Bill: Mood!
N🆗ri (Marisa): rip the tutorial i was using had steps that didn't exist in photoshop despite being a photoshop tutorial and then i lost most of the progress so here's a glowing circle arm
N🆗ri (Marisa): the original image doesn't seem to be very high quality, i had to constantly get rid of noise when brightening it
Bill: Oh god she isn’t shooting jpg is she.
Bill: *I need to help you*
N🆗ri (Marisa): might be the only thing the camera can shoot in. mine only does jpg
Bill: Hers is a Nikon more advanced than my original, it definitely has raw.
Bill: There’s no evidence on way or the other, exports are always going to be non raw.
Bill: But. Oh shit she probably is cause she doesn’t have raw editing software.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Her photos are jpg
Bill: *aaaa*aaa*aaa*hhh*hhhh*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 6:47am <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): i found some pictures of flora ~~that i never returned omg oops~~ that i thought were gonna be atrocious but they arent too bad
N🆗ri (Marisa): and meg but something is wrong with those
N🆗ri (Marisa): too bright?
N🆗ri (Marisa): files are too big for discord lol rip
Bill: Screen shot. Win+s iirc
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): too something.
Bill: You edit these?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
N🆗ri (Marisa): super obvious right <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: You dropped the highlights to non existence. It makes everything feel flat and foggy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That pink is very loud
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's loud to intimidate her enemies on the battlefield
Bill: That’s just Marisa and the saturation slider.
N🆗ri (Marisa): according to an article the other day the depression messes with my vision of colors <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Yes I remember you posting that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): flora's don't seem to be *too* bad but i have no idea how i got so high up. i think like steve helped hold me up or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): but it's still a bit off
N🆗ri (Marisa): and sponsored by fulton bank
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Both of those are cute.
N🆗ri (Marisa): flora is adorable!! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Aflorable
N🆗ri (Marisa): did ny'all run into any local trouble this year?
Bill: The bottom one could use a little more dead space on the right side to balance, but that’s not wrong just typical style.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ok guys last 2 and I'm done I got carried away lmao 
Now I gotta get my lazy ass up and work on this robe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof the quality botching of discord. Anyway BLAKE ROBE

Bill: Seriously backup up your work.
Bill: It’s important.
