One hop this time (Tom): yeee
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): is cosplay.com basically dead now
Bill: it always seemed dead to me.
Bill: But I only started looking early last year.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it used to be quite poppin', it's where photoshoots (private and public gatherings) would be planned before facebook kicked off for that stuff
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): now there are 5 threads for the upcoming katsu when before there'd be like 50
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): my cosplay books are getting delivered today hurry up. i woke up early and put non-hello kitty pants on for this.
One hop this time (Tom): the ol change to answer the door menuever
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i made another super tentative katsucon draft but i feel like i'm forgetting something important
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i chatted with... rebecca? i think? about an owari no seraph shoot but i don't think she's very interested
Bill: Rebecca is good for stuff.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): We didn’t make any concrete plans just some chat in BNE, it’d be fun but I dunno if she wants a duo or prefers single cosplays
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): She'd probably be up for it if you followed up but your line up is pretty packed 😮 Rebecca likes cosplaying with friends from what I know
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): What do you mean it’s packed it’s super bare bones
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I purposefully left extra room
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): How long before 595 again?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): WOAH u so famous
600 party
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i got my package, the dude didn't knock on the door he just put it in the mailbox. the package is the exact size of the mailbox. it look a while to get it out
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): congrats for 600 though that's really cool!!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): do you have any advice for not losing followers ;3c
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo tank! I'm sure it'll be back under 600 in a few days cuz that's how it works but tank
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🤔
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't really do much? I just post once every 2-5 days. Most my followers are there for RWBY, mm or nier I guess?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ooo the stability that makes sense. ur a star!! 🌟 <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> they love u!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I hope you book didn't get damaged!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): a bit of bending on the top where it rubbed against the mailbox in my desperate clawing to free it but it's ok!!
i'm looking over the contents now. it spells "hood" like "food" and now i'm hungry
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh noes! Y he cram it in there? 😭
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I KNOW RIGHT rude
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's got pictures of what skirts look like before and after petticoats which i appreciate
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): and 2d equivalents of what the skirt would look like
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I am gonna make a TON of these
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the second book is really heavy. i bought it used because amazon didn't have it in stock and i paid extra for the "like new" copy so i really hope all the patterns are here
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): some of the information overlaps but there's some really good stuff in here. the first book lists recommended fabrics for certain styles and costumes (like, urban twill and tartan is good for uniforms! and then later on the uniform it'll say to use urban twill for best results). the second one just lists everything freely and what stuff it might be good for and lets you pick.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's also got information on thread thicknesses, sewing machine foots, and the best bra padding
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if anyone wants translations of any stuff i can share because this is good stuff
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): 
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): how to make pompoms and tassels and stuff so i don't have to order them from china or order making kits from china anymore. sweet. and apparently bias tape should be cut on a diagonal haha whoops
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh wow!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's chock full of product placement but not in a bad way, just "here's an example of thread! and a seam ripper!" and it has the thread or seam ripper with the brand logo very prominently displayed, but at least it's not like "for this project you need the Clover™ Mega Smooth Flawless Seam Ripper Deluxe 2015™!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): japanese sewing spelling is really funny
jigjag stitch
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): these books know their audience very well.
the one is sponsored by a store and there's about 3 pages of tutorial on how to go to the store with a reference image and ask the staff to help you pick out fabric that matches in color and type lol
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): "pls ma'am i am but a reclusive nerd. help me find fabric."
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Mmmm league of legends cosplay is tempting
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): do it owo
I don't know any of the characters but I know the fox girl is cosplayed a whole lot, so she very popular
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ahri
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): on the other hand if you cosplay ahri we could talk in fake bougie accents, like "ahhh georgiah dear, how ah you?"
One hop this time (Tom): images of the dude just placing the end of the package daintily into the mailbox 
then running full speed and drop kicking it into the mailbox
One hop this time (Tom): a job well doen
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): One of the books has a mascot character and it tells you how to cosplay their mascot. She’s basically an amalgamation of everything the book has a tutorial on so I wasn’t fond of her design but there are so many neat little details. Like her bracelets are pin cushions and all her ribbons/bows are measuring tapes.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): who's excited for katsu
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'm having US con withdrawals, Japanese events are like 6 hours at most and just for socializing
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): people are terrified to socialize with the non-japanese <:lenny:395307171539189760>
One hop this time (Tom): YEAH, US CONS
One hop this time (Tom): They def seem very different
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): KATSU = MAWISA = EXCITEMENT
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'm gonna have to buy a portable battery for my phone just because the cat selfie filter on my phone eats up battery like crazy and that'll be a necessity and i can't just camp outside of main events charging my phone against the pillar all day. that's a "it's sunday and we've checked out of the room and my phone is dying" move.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sept we aint checkin out on sunday 👀
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): phone charing all day
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): YEAH it'll be a monday move now. how late are we staying on monday. all day cosplay <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): maybe i can take it in
