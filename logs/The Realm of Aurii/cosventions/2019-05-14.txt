Nokri (Marisa): OH BOY i just got a random instagram message!! from someone i don't know!! asking if i'm going to animenext! ðŸ‘€ this is terrifying and exciting
Bill: who?
Nokri (Marisa): it's a photographer i think ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€
Nokri (Marisa): aoisenko
Elfriede Faun (Tom): wooo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): exciting
Nokri (Marisa): it is a photog ðŸ‘€
they seem really familiar but i don't recall ever meeting them
Nokri (Marisa): we don't follow each other though, and they didn't like or comment on any of my posts so idk what they want ðŸ™€ am nervous about talking to strangers
Nokri (Marisa): will respond in............................... 15 minutes
Bill: you talk to stranger photographers all the time though.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What why username
Bill: aoisenko
Bill: She said it.
Nokri (Marisa): but i'm always the one initiating contact and i do insane stalker levels of research into them beforehand
Nokri (Marisa): at a glance they pass the non creep test
Nokri (Marisa): they seem nice
Nokri (Marisa): i responded afsghfj
Nokri (Marisa): time to go build a city in minecraft
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O I thought that was a random Japanese word ahaaaa
Bill: It kinda is but not in any meaningful way.
Bill: focus on the physics, you can be a functional member of society after that.
Bill: maybe. :3c
Nokri (Marisa): oh he's offering paid shoots
<:thinku:543194478614413318>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I always thought that was odd, photographers messaging you to ask you to hire them
Nokri (Marisa): yeah it's a bit off putting
Nokri (Marisa): i assume he's going through the animenext tag and messaging every cosplayer posting there
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof
Nokri (Marisa): i dont wanna be rude ;u; i told him i didn't know what i was cosplaying yet
Nokri (Marisa): maaaaan i got all excited thinking it was a "hey, i like your x costume and was interested in shooting!" but of course not ;u;
Bill: Oof
Bill: I mentioned to that person I met at college a few times when she cosplays Leon again Iâ€™d shoot it, but.
Bill: Different things.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah
this guy was basically saying
"are you going to animenext?"
"yeah"
"if you want to book a shoot i can send you my rates"
<:hmm:543194383885926403>
Nokri (Marisa): kinda feels like a punch in the gut
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awww mawisa I sowwy that happen to you ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): is ok! is not a bad thing :0
Bill: What a tool.
Nokri (Marisa): ye that's me!
Bill: Stop.
Bill: Donâ€™t make it sound like Iâ€™m insulting you. ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): sorry i'm just beating myself up for being an idiot with issues
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nope nope nope
Bill: Your allowed to get excited by a message silly.
Nokri (Marisa): i did get invited to join a cosplay group! they said they were east coast but all the cons they talk about are at least as far as colossalcon <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): You smart. Good friend. Good person. Great cosplay. 10/10 person
Nokri (Marisa): is jess! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nooo I was too slow
Nokri (Marisa): i think discord is glitched the reacts keep disappearing <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I feel that way from some notifications too. I get all hype thinking itâ€™s one thing and get disappointed.
Nokri (Marisa): i've never heard of photogs doing that on insta, i've only seen it on facebook where they comment "wow i like this character! I'll shoot it for $80 here's my signup sheet"
Bill: Itâ€™s really odd. They just must be super desperate and LAME.
Nokri (Marisa): no they looked really cool and had over 1000 followers
Nokri (Marisa): personalized marketing strategy
Nokri (Marisa): oh he actually has very reasonable prices though!! $30 for half hour, 10-20 images
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I'd feel the same tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Like yeay they like.my Leo cosplay! Noone even recognizes it unless I'm at a tekken tournament! (And even they they ask me what character I am sometimes <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> )
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And then nah fam
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just asking for the monies
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I guess it is possible that they did actually like that cosplay too and just didn't wanna shoot for free
Bill: Yeeee
Bill: huh.
Bill: A non con cosplay burlesque.
Nokri (Marisa): Cosplay burlesque is technically a guest at conventions, they have to be invited and are given all guest privileges (a handler, a table in the dealers hall, panels, etc.) so it makes sense they do non-con stuff
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dunellen is 15 mins from skool wow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): deadline to order otakon badges and have them mailed to you is today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): in case anyone wanted to super confirm theyre going to ota
Bill: Did I order one.
Bill: Shit.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh mine won't get mailed cuz I only got 2-day
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@351785752197201920>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I gotta check
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): whaaat they only mail 3 day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats lame
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait maybe not?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): says it can be added
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait no yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): full weekend only
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Mailed badges are only available for Full Weekend (Supporting Members)."*
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof we thought we already got them but we didnt
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats another $190 ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): They havenâ€™t got the minimum number of registrations to cut it off before the deadline? Scary
Bill: 190?
Bill: Ah.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof i forgot to get mine... i better get on that
Bill: ~~there's a 13 dollar charge for mail badges so it'll be even more~~
Bill: Yeah I just bought mine.
Bill: The mail badge is 100% worth though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): for 2
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no answer from nasa yet... i could probably buy an otakon badge, even if i get a last minute call ill probably be able to make it
Aldus Larian (Jess): MONEY STRESS AHHHH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MOOD
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> https://petapixel.com/2019/05/14/why-photographers-arent-getting-paid/
Nokri (Marisa): Wow, Bill is the reason photographers arenâ€™t getting paid.
Nokri (Marisa): Did you tag me because youâ€™re admitting your guilt
Bill: Actually now that I think about it you were working for 'free' with sewing not photos but YOU.
Nokri (Marisa): The article is all about you <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: ~~I only shoot the same half dozen people so I'm only ruining your expectations of what you should have to pay for photos~~
Bill: ~~I'm also better than anyone else in our circles if I don't say so myself, so love me feed me, never leave me~~
Nokri (Marisa): I just YOLOâ€™d a really big part of this dress and it came out beautifully Iâ€™m shook. Arguably one of my best pieces. Canâ€™t wait to mess it up beyond repair down the line.
Bill: OOH
Bill: AMAZING MAWISA
Bill: Whatcha working on?
Nokri (Marisa): AHA there it is thereâ€™s something I messed up on
Nokri (Marisa): Raphtalia
Nokri (Marisa): I steamed the pleats with metal pins in it and they became rusty and left marks on the fabric <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): Pleats are the reason I will never work in a high end department store
Theyâ€™re easy to do but wow do they suck
Bill: Oh Sailor skirts got it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~unrelated to that~~ but for ota we were all planning to do fri-sun?
Bill: Room's are thursday-sunday.
Bill: I was planning that cause bum rushing on friday morning was hell coming from Sussex.
Nokri (Marisa): Not sailor skirt pleats but same idea <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: Wow.
Nokri (Marisa): I cleaned the mirror I promise
Nokri (Marisa): The specks must be ghosts
Bill: That is the cutest sewing gremlin I've ever seen. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): Thanks itâ€™s the octopus from zenkaiâ€™s under the sea theme that they just decided to keep every year after. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s there again.
Bill: the mirror in our hallway is worse than that.
Nokri (Marisa): Too many ghosts in your hallway
Bill: We're getting rid of it, eventually.
Nokri (Marisa): Thatâ€™s even more cursed though
Bill: But it has better light than my closet mirror so I always end up in the hallway when I need said mirror.
Nokri (Marisa): Thatâ€™s the other side beckoning you over
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hopefully cap marvel will be here for ota o3o
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i can make ota a marvel weekend xD
Bill: Still plans to do Genderbenders at Ota?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Widow *should* be in by Ota
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): can't wait to die of heat exhaustion! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye but i dont need to worry about cap at all
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause tis done
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): did your shield come in yet?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA SAME ERIK
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh it'll be here in about 3 days
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): noice
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but everything else is here and all set
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and the electromagnet?
Bill: Assuming I can get the wog sorted out... Timberlands come tomorrow and I can wear leather all of outkon.
Bill: I don't match but.
Bill: Close enough.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): magnets gonna be a bit longer
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but itll be here before cap marvel
Bill: doing cap marvel or Yang Marvel?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~both? maybe?~~ yang wig might literally kill me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pleather + yang wig?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): in otakon heat?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: Yang, in Captain Marvel:
Yang, to Blake: "I am the captain now"
Blake: "Yes Captain"

And there was much ~~sex~~ rejoicing
Nokri (Marisa): The con is air conditioned eyyy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): EYYYYYYYYYY
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but is it good enough AC
Bill: We're not in the same hotel though <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): Pppppprobably?
Bill: Not for leather.
Nokri (Marisa): Is there even a hotel attached to the con center
Bill: Ye.
Nokri (Marisa): It was fine for leather in Baltimore
Bill: The Marriott.
Bill: We stayed there lol.
Bill: The first year.
Nokri (Marisa): Ooooo thatâ€™s the place Courtney had us in?
Bill: Yeah.
Nokri (Marisa): That was connected? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: I can technically get rooms there. For 600 a night.
Nokri (Marisa): OH UEAH underground
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nice! kalahari pricing!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): minus the water park
Bill: And Kalahari's group block rate is insanely good.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): remember to not bring a bag into the con center lest you want to wait in line con going betwixt the hotel and the con center
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ahhhh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): luckily femcap has pockets now
Bill: Guard: 
Me:
Me: It's a lens in my pocket, I'm not happy to see you.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Nokri (Marisa): Just remember to leave two hours before you have to be somewhere
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe youâ€™ll make it on time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ive never been to ota, this is gonna be an experience huh?
Nokri (Marisa): Really!!!????!??
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeeep
Nokri (Marisa): Is gonna be fun!
Nokri (Marisa): I do miss the BCC though that was great. Con goers abused it so much though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): BCC? <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): What time
Nokri (Marisa): Baltimore convention center <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Nokri (Marisa): Where it was held until ~3 years ago? 4 years ago?
Nokri (Marisa): My first Otakon was 2010ish so whenever I think of ota I think of Baltimore first
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I keep thinking the MM people are gonna be there again and then remembering they aren't ðŸ˜­
Bill: correction, I can get rooms in the con center for twice the price via chase.
Bill: ~~though I had a scare it was only 20 bucks more and THAT might have been jump worthy~~
Bill: *gags*
Bill: 3000 dollars.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I haven't posted to insta in like 40 years
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 3000 dollars
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): jklsahlfkshda
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WHAT
Bill: Non con rate.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): -screams-
Nokri (Marisa): what a bargain
Bill: and that's even discounted cause of booking through my rewards program.
Bill: Staying in a big city *sucks*.
Bill: NYC is just as bad.
Nokri (Marisa): Least thereâ€™s no more matsuri so we donâ€™t have to pay for Wednesday-Sunday
Bill: I should be needling Jess to try and get her to do Daredevil... :3c
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): okay well that sells it fem  thor gona have a utility belt
Bill: Tho actually, whenever I think about 'what if someone did another character from Defenders', I keep thinking of Kilgrave as not genderswapped.
Bill: I always have to go 'wait, need a girl for that'.
Bill: ~~Ya'll going to leave me to suffer with the camera equipment in the line I use to photo you?~~
Bill: ~~I see how it is~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wat
Bill: You mentioned daredevil as a potential entry to the marvel stuff. I was joking that I should be trying to convincing you to do it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea I got that part
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): theyre weenies about prop check too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): gosh they analyzed my pyrrha sword FOREVER
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't get the crossed out part
Bill: Everyone's talking about ways to get around the bag check lines at Otakon.
Bill: I can't really ditch my bag if I'm shooting.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I didn't realize it was in reference to that
Bill: yeye
Bill: speaking of... I think I actually do want yet another camera backpack.
Bill: One with a back opening that lets you access everything from the same side.
Bill: The sideways pockets are neat on mine but they're clunky for someone who uh. Over packs.
Bill: like dis.
Bill: "Tactical patches that everyone loves" Sure those are cool but how do you use those.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What's a tactical patch
Bill: 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The Velcro?
Bill: Ye. I guess you can buy pouches designed to attach to it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Iâ€™ve only seen people use those for patches
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is it velcro? or those elastic loop things?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that you can like shove stuff in
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i cant TELL
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is that in the back?
Bill: strip things are on the back, the case opens from the side that rests on your back.
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait patch or pouch?
Bill: looks like not velcro.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's for MOLLE attachments
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah those loopies
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye Sam showed me his from the military
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOLLE
Aldus Larian (Jess): you can put moles in them wow
Aldus Larian (Jess): did Georgia take all the MM pics at zenkai?
Bill: yes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): coo thank
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I forgot about this one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dats a good one
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1140971-REG/lowepro_lp36874_pro_runner_bp_350.html I kinda like this... no side pocket access, but makes makes use of the same amount of space I have in the current one.
Bill: The tactical one is another 100 bucks, but has side access.
Bill: with the mail in rebate actually they're pretty similar.
Bill: Though I should really be not lazy and go to B&H after work and see them in person.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye, thats prob your best bet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): seeing them in person will help your decision making
Bill: Yeah. It's mostly I dunno if I wanna go up to the larger size.
Bill: They both have 350 (which is the same as my backpack now) but also 450 and I'm a *bit* of an over packer.
Bill: But like, I can fit everything I need to right now and it's not like extra space is going to do anything for me if there's nothing in it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dawww Justin made 9Ass his profile pic
Bill: That he did.
Bill: I have taken many of those.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): justin was worried about 9s for a while
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he wanted it perfect
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and he was worried he wouldnt be good enough for us ðŸ˜¢
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he mustve been v happy to make 9s his new profile pic
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): nOoooOO ðŸ˜­
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): AWWWWWW
Bill: That shoot was a mess too, after you froze out at Zeikaniâ€™s I was too worried about you to really enjoy being outside more.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Eh I still had funsies
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And we were a bamf group
Bill: Was a good group just.
Bill: Worry.
Bill: You donâ€™t have A2 in any of your future plans tho do you?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i treat Justin like I should be watching over him but heâ€™s 25 lmao_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not the NIER future <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I know what upgrades I wanna make
Bill: Summer would be the time to wear her.
Bill: Whenever of course, just glad you werenâ€™t turned off by the whole Katsu ice barrens experience.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof katsu was rough
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah katsi was rough oof
Bill: Too crowded for the elegant indoors and and too cold for outside.
Bill: For Nier.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hmm I actually have motivation to think about cosplay for the first time in like 2 months woe
Nokri (Marisa): Whatâ€™s your next cosplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uhhh idk
Nokri (Marisa): *but jess*

Aldus Larian (Jess): Eh idk still weary on the pleather
Bill: Do spandex instead?
Bill: Or scarf head?
Bill: Oooooog shooting that fight scene in the hallway from season 1 could be coooool
Bill: I donâ€™t remember it well but I remembering it being unique and stylistic.
Bill: Oh the problem must be that Jess has peaked at mystic messenger. She can have her husbandos and be her husbandos. :3c
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think i looks good in crossplay D:
Bill: Iâ€™m also kidding silly. But you do look good!
Bill: I still really liked your Seven. And V.
Bill: I feel like you did actual V and not just swim V at some point?
Bill: Or am I confusing sweater for MC with sweater for V.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no i did full V for like 30 mins
Bill: It did exist okay.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i look ok as V
Bill: You good V!
Aldus Larian (Jess): look meh as seven and realy bad as unknown
Bill: Takes a V to know a V!
Bill: Your Seven was good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thank
Bill: Unknown didnâ€™t quite click, Iâ€™ll give you that. Itâ€™s not my favorite.
Aldus Larian (Jess): my arms are too fat, and the color bunch up my neck fat ðŸ˜­
Bill: I was terribly preoccupied the day you wore it though so itâ€™s a bit of a blur.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah it was bad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): prob best you dont remember it
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~plus tom looks so much better~~
Bill: Iâ€™m just saying I donâ€™t remember well. Iâ€™m being honest with Seven and V, and honest with unknown too.
Bill: ~~heâ€™s your husband I hope you like him in leather~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): D: its minimal leather!
Bill: *But he look good in it*
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): he looks good in everything!
Aldus Larian (Jess): he even looks good as a damn woman
Bill: That is true but weâ€™re talking about mystic messenger cosplay.
Bill: What, poppy?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean its not my FAV but he still looks good
Bill: >.> eeeeeh. Heâ€™s got a masculine enough face it doesnâ€™t work for me. But I know him well.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol
Bill: Lol Anna asked me if I was okay with her drawing the post Leanna did today.
Bill: She didnâ€™t realize I did the uraraka photo of Georgia apparently.
