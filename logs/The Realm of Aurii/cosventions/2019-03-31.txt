Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I meant to shave my chest but I forgot 😅

Bill: Flickr that makes no SENSE.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik):

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What was the squad consensus on CPAC?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd be cool with it ~~but we'd have to let Rebecca know since apparently she's tagging along with me~~
Bill: CPAC I’m in for.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm in
N🆗ri (Marisa): i might be able to go saturday ;u;
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's going on the night of the 13th? is that a slumber party?
N🆗ri (Marisa): depending on what's happening i gotta change my costume. because of sakura sunday i won't do a troll because the grey sticks to my skin for a few days. if i'm returning home i'll do dog tier because poofy skirt, if i'm staying in north jersey i'll make a new outfit for kogara
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okay CPAC is it then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Both days? Just Saturday? Obviously I can offer lodging
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t know if I’m closest tho
Bill: I'd say just saturday? If you wanted to do something else could do it sunday. I know you don't care much for CPAC.
Bill: You are.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wasn't ethan's party saturday?
Bill: Friday.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye ethan is on Friday and they leave in the morning
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~wait i lied i can only do sunday. my nephew's birthday is on saturday SHOOT~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Elizabeth Maxwell will be at CPAC
N🆗ri (Marisa): i kidnap my nephew from his first birthday party and bring him to cpac. problem solved.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Start em young
Bill: ~~he won't remember the birthday anyway it fine~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone didn't watch the promised neverland <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ooh and there's a maid cafe
N🆗ri (Marisa): "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I watched up until the one part that's supposed to be shocking and then I stopped x:
N🆗ri (Marisa): the first episode? :0
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh no I guess I watched further
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They were trying to get out
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And then the new mama came and I was like iight.... I'm bored
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo sister krone! the horribly racist stereotype
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yes her
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Big yikes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Fek now I gotta find out what to wear
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What’s everyone wearing lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): leave clues and hints around the con so if i go i can find them and pretend to be weeby sherlock holmes
N🆗ri (Marisa): milky holmes the moe blob knock-off
Bill: don't become a loli.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the manga i'm reading has an immortal loli principle it's a valid occupation
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~is ethane injury gonna prevent them from coming?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He said he was supposed to be out for like 3 week's which would put him at the week before party
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): does anyone know what's happening the night of the 13th
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I dont think anything?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Or maybe I'm just forgetting something
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Isn't that "Marisa spends the night in northern Jersey and then go to Sakura Sunday the next day" night?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo. then maybe i can do a troll cosplay for kogara
N🆗ri (Marisa): the faraway mystic dangerlands of north jersey
N🆗ri (Marisa): where everything is backwards and people associate more with new york than philadelphia. freaky.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ah shoot i threw away my black collar button up shirt in japan.
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i'm returning to south jersey for the night then i may cosplay nepeta and if i do y'all are welcome to the giant vat of green cupcake frosting i'm going to consume throughout the entire day to keep my tongue green
Bill: Gotta check with Tom and Jess but that's what I'm assuming the plan is.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye boiiii
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wait am I coming over after work then?
Aldus Larian (Jess): If you want to, yea! Everyone's welcome but it will probably make thing less convenient for most of you
Bill: It wouldn't make much sense for you if Noah's coming. You'd be better off coming together from school. Otherwise... Ye okay Jess is right, you'd be adding the round trip on to us.

But Marisa is worth it so.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okie if Noah comes we will leave from skool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Otherwise I may come up just so we can chill that night
Bill: Where is pax east?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Boston
Bill: Really. I couldn’t figure it out based on who was there.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye orson the other side of Boston from anime Boston and they used to be on the same weekend
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And would have livestream "portals" showing into the other con
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Where you could stand in frame and talk to someone at pax and vice versa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Pretty cool idea xD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe I’ll wear star to CPAC again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The zipper broke last year and I still haven’t fixed it oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I could wear Ladybug also
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wanna give love to a cosplay I haven’t worn enough
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Guess I should let Rebecca know we're doing CPAC. Just want to confirm before I buy a ticket
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: why did she want to do the party in the first place.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Prob just to get out and see frens
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Shes lonely too, so yea definitely
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo ladybug!!
That portal story is really neat <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is anyone doing all weekend cpac or is everyone doing one day?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Probably just one day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye prob just Saturday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOOK WHAT I FOUND
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Bill: *wowww*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Now I can be like Bill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And have my badge on a fancy lanyard
Bill: I have half a dozen of them, you could have asked if you wanted one.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀 can I have one bill ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): What is it :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is it part of a collar are we exposing people as furries
Bill: only you for thinking that.
Bill: It's a retracting badge holder.
Bill: Remind me, I still have a few extra somewhere.
N🆗ri (Marisa): #exposed furry
Bill: I'm glad you've come out to us.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Furry coming out party for marisa? When?
N🆗ri (Marisa): No u
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Im being framed
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is a bait and switch
Bill: there's literally nothing, you said it youself.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That was you
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): Proof
N🆗ri (Marisa): The internet never lies ever
Bill: that's... *totally convincing.*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): BILL I cant believe you tried to cover it up
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): We have TWO furries now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Congratulations
N🆗ri (Marisa): Biru and Leanna two furries wow
Bill: Only Marisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just Monica
Bill: just YOU
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Pawisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m deleting the internet
Bill: oh true her screename is Pawlitics.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH SHIT IT IS LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): DOXXED
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s because America is undergoing a time of tumultuous politics and not for furry reasons
Bill: your fursona is a pawlitician then?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): a lot of pawliticians are furries
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So it makes sense
N🆗ri (Marisa): Only a furry could make that joke
Bill: whose joking.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had to explain to the mayor what a furry was it was excruciating
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is at the fabric store I teach at and  slightly concerned
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
