N🆗ri (Marisa): oh question!! have the driving arrangements for going down been decided
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~am i able to get to katsu~~
Bill: yes.
Bill: I'll get you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): bless, lemme know how much i owe for car ride
and question
im trying to salvage katarina as best i can and if i can complete her without everything else going horribly wrong i might get the outfit pressed, but that means it'd have to be transported in a dress bag and i don't want to take up too much space ~~i've already got the violin~~. it would just be in a bag on the way down and i'd throw it in the suitcase after wearing it so it wouldnt take up any more room. but if the car is crowded or you're opposed to having a costume hanging in a bag then i won't get it pressed beforehand and i'll just iron it at the con
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _stupid stressful Katsu_
Bill: You can do that. Does it matter for the trip back, cause we're supposed to take Jess and Tom home too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank!! don't worry about the ride back i'll have it put away. i can carry the violin or put it by my feet i don't take up much room
Bill: We'll have plenty of room for you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i fit in trunks
i can punch the light out and wave at people in the car behind us it'll be fun
Bill: you will not do that, it may well be a new car.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _marisa are you john mulaney_
N🆗ri (Marisa): i relate extremely strongly to his bit about being a bad driver
Bill: The same person works at Grey Towers as last year.
Bill: Such a nice woman too.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think we have good luck with photoshoot location owners
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like the guy at chatterbox
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he was so freakin nice 😭
Bill: We’ll see when I hear from knoebels again.
