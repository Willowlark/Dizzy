Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Pay you... to photograph you... on location?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bruh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ill probably just say somethin vague like "yeah it depends on the concept, but i understand we're all broke college students so i doubt id charge that much lol"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH IKR
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Weird flex but okay
Nokri (Marisa): japanese photographers do that for japanese cosplayers!
Bill: Planning on doing it then...?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it wasnt a straight up offer yet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Nokri (Marisa): i got invited to the private cosplay beach day thing they host every year!! :0
they didn't invite me last year and i was invited via proxy the 2~3 years before that but this year the host invited me <:woah:543194447345876998>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Well, I guess if he's seeking you out to model, it kind of makes sense to pay you. Where cosplayers usually seek photographers to pay for their service, photographers could seek out models to pay for their service. Kind of makes sense considering you put time and money into *your* work. Just a bit backwards from what we're used to, but makes sense I guess
Bill: The model industry is like that, cosplay is backwards. Photographers use the photos (and get the long term benefit/monetary gains of a photoshoot) in modeling while in cosplay it's the cosplayers that use the photos.
Nokri (Marisa): the supply/demand for cosplay made it backwards. cosplayers wanted cool pictures of themselves but there wasn't really a demand for cosplay pictures from consumers, so cosplayers began paying to get pictures
Aldus Larian (Jess): I find it endlessly entertaining that my 2 mormy friends only like my cosplays where I have a red wig üòÇ
Nokri (Marisa): bnha cheerleader uniforms can be bought for under $20, that took longer than expected
Nokri (Marisa): omg
Nokri (Marisa): omg who needs a costume for colossal east
Nokri (Marisa): please consider
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: <@!386874959009415170> obviously.
Bill: Just glue a red wig on top.
Nokri (Marisa): catch me cooling off by the poolside like
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Street sharks ü¶à
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> <@!301927856240459777> Which is the green cloak one in deltarune?
Bill: That Meg cosplayed at Zenkai?
Nokri (Marisa): ralsei!
Bill: üôè Mawisa you have saved my life
Nokri (Marisa): are u sending pictures

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OwO did you say cheap BNHA cheerleader outfits?

Aldus Larian (Jess): I will do the look in a bit

Nokri (Marisa): post bad picture here i try to save it
Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/gallery/2019/06/12/terra-titans-zenkai19.html whole gallery. Yangs all that‚Äôs left from Zenkai.
Bill: Georgia and Jess seem busy so I‚Äôll skip another at.
Nokri (Marisa): oof sorry i ruined the shoot
Bill: ITS NOT YOU
Nokri (Marisa): naw i can't pull off crop tops or blonde hair
Bill: It‚Äôs a poor shoot cause of the light quality, the brick, cold, and rushing because we were all cold.
Bill: PLEASE don‚Äôt not make it sound like I said bad shoot because of you.
Nokri (Marisa): naw ur gr9 camera man!
Nokri (Marisa): i was looking at <$10 cosplay swimsuits earlier for beach day before realizing that nothing will look good but i'm like 90% sure i found some kind of crochless ouran high school host club uniform-inspired swimsuit and i'm still worried about that existing
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ....what
Bill: Stop Marisa. I‚Äôm not fishing for compliments. I don‚Äôt feel great about the shoot and I‚Äôm going to learn from it and do better next time. If you want to tell me your thoughts on it that‚Äôs fine but you don‚Äôt need to give me sweeping compliments just because one thing didn‚Äôt go well. 

NOR do you take credit for the failing, because it‚Äôs NOT you and I want to own my own mistakes nor have you taking responsibility for things that aren‚Äôt yours.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): wait maybe it's not ouran? ?? but it's SUPER similar
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh lawd
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
