Total Nok-out (Marisa): hmm. i know this entire thing looks like the bad photoshop that it is but does the trail of blood make it *extra* bad?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ehh idk here's a sappy version with lots of poorly photoshopped blood and i can take it out if u desperately want a bloodless copy for reasons ðŸ¤·
Total Nok-out (Marisa): rtyruythgrf ok i'm leaving for school now

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I like it alot actually!
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Iâ€™m on da train now
Do you want anything fixed or changed.  I can send u a jpeg
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): I gotta figure out fake blood itâ€™s been eternity since I photoshopped anything that isnâ€™t smoke or cosmetics or erasing a tattoo
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Whatâ€™s the Grimm equivalent of a furry
Grimmy
Elfriede of commitment?: Oo nicuuu
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Be scathing donâ€™t hold back
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I like it da way it is <:mew_face:498866691963355137>  i cant submit it tho cuz it has to be a makeup look. But i will cherish it fover
Bill: I didnâ€™t realize it wasnâ€™t real until I say the photoshop ui.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but biru u took that photo

No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Frame it on your wall
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Nay, the ceiling

No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): did georgia use any one specific grimm as reference for her makeup ~~asking for absolutely no reason whatsoever and definitely not to photoshop her~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): *georgia can i use one of your weiss pics*
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): _ye you can_
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and nah i just did whatever

No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): o das a neat idea
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): feels are good
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): weiss is harder than i thought because the black and white and red and blue are hard to mix *but i'll do it*
