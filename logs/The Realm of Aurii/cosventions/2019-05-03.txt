Bill: With such a random assortment and the time difference between them, you must have gone scrolling through my profile a bit. How nice. ~~and it's not even a Georgia fan, they liked Tom and Jess too~~
Bill: I should post.
Bill: Good god I'm like, 15 galleries behind.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): god i hate starting vlogs but as soon as i start i have dun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but _starting_
Aldus Larian (Jess): What a mood
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@184437198865563648>  Sakura Sunday isn't done yet right?
Bill: No.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👌
Bill: ~~is that good?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok I'm just saying ok
Bill: Wow I'm so used to ok_hand being used for good things I think of that first as opposed to "ok".
Bill: What's the plan with geekdom? Cause I low key want to know if we can plan to do something more fun that weekend, like anothe photo adventure or a NYC trip.
Aldus Larian (Jess): They never sent me my free ticket so fuck em
N🆗ri (Marisa): Was considering geekdom
What was free ticket for? :0
Message them and complain
Aldus Larian (Jess): They told Tom and theyd send us free tickets if we cosplayed 2b and 9s to the con but never sent them
Bill: and also it was creep central next year... Lets take Mawisa to the zoo so she can be with her furry kind.
N🆗ri (Marisa): !!???
Like beforehand on social media? Through an official channel? Sounds like you should’ve gotten free admissions, send them the complaints with screenshots
N🆗ri (Marisa): Philly Zoo is too expensive, Cape May has a “pay what you can” admission fee
Bill: bronx zoo. Because NYC is better.
N🆗ri (Marisa): New York City has a zoo outside of Central Park? :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): Let’s go to Otakon early on Thursday so we can do all the free stuff
Bill: We can't all do the day off work. 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Say it’s in the national interest you take off fully paid
N🆗ri (Marisa): They’ll understand
Bill: My company is canadian so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ew
N🆗ri (Marisa): Blame Canada
Bill: While Jess dabs.
Bill: Literally in the corner of the frame just. Looking.
N🆗ri (Marisa): He looks 5
Elfriede Faun (Tom): im 5 yes
Bill: oof savage Mawisa.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think he looks 7
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😎 👉 👉
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is not a roast just a simple statement 
You could sneak into the playground at McDonald’s with that youthful appearance
N🆗ri (Marisa): Eyyyyyyy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Aww I just made one of the nicest princess sleeves I ever did do, but I sewed it upside down lol rip
Bill: *And all the 15 year old girls at the con go "GOD I wish that were me"*
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s the face of someone wearing socks with toe holes <:mew_face:498866691963355137>
Aldus Larian (Jess): It was an zenkai that they told us but 🤷
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's really strange
i heard a few years back zenkai had issues with people inviting guests to the con but it wasn't official, so the guest would show up and expect their paycheck/free entry and the con would be like "uh.... what"
maybe the people fired from zenkai went to staff geekdom
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it was a lol weird. And last year was weird
Aldus Larian (Jess): Those 15 year old girls prob think tom is thier age
N🆗ri (Marisa): a guy their age dressing up as the mystic messenger is equivalent to a guy signing up for home ec just to be in a class with a lot of girls
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good strat
N🆗ri (Marisa): all the girls who play otome games are bi because only girls dress up as the otome bois
dress up as otome game guys = get girls
we solved the formula
Aldus Larian (Jess): HAck3ed
Bill: ooof boudoir feeling hit or miss as the overall mood so far.
Bill: Light position REALLY matters.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do I have a neck?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do I look like I gained 30 lbs?
Bill: *NoO* it's gone.
Bill: Ethan was right!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Fuck
Bill: No you don't. I'm talking about quality of light. Particularly even with the umbrellas it was harsh, so at some angles skin (pre the clarity slider) skin isn't 'soft' as I'd hoped it be. Also some shots closer to the bed were just weird.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was like pitch black in that room
Bill: I suppose there's a learning curve to this since it totally different that all my other shooting and I gotta acknowledge that but oof.
Bill: I can do betta.
Bill: and also my composition was all over ~~but I was getting good and drunk so~~.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh but that's my secret. My skin is never soft
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok that's not exactly tru
Bill: AAH you guys are cute as hell and the composition is bad and the bed is too freaking smollll
Aldus Larian (Jess): We redo. On race car bed
Bill: That sounds like *hell*
Aldus Larian (Jess): But biru is so in character
Bill: You guys are so GOOD and there's NO way to get the water bottle and luggage outta the shot like
Aldus Larian (Jess): Him eat hair
Aldus Larian (Jess): Theyre just hydrated is all
Bill: I understand it would be in character... But I need you to trust me, cause Rika would have uh. Wanted it to not be a race car bed.
Aldus Larian (Jess): By this point in sevens route I don't think he puts much value in anything Rika ever said <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Whose hiding something.
Bill: I'm not hiding anything.
Aldus Larian (Jess): *what now*
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok so i don't intend this in a mean way at all and i hope it comes off comical
but with the hair hiding most of his skin tom's face in that picture has a similar shape to the awesome seven drawing you did earlier
Bill: LOLOLOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn is was bad wasn't it
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'mma go delete it
N🆗ri (Marisa): NO IT WASN'T
N🆗ri (Marisa): NO
Bill: She... compared it to your husband's face.
Bill: Which is obviously GOOD.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's ok i saved it for posterity
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO
Bill: So shes aid it was good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's so bad 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's cool!!!!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~oof I have to remind myself not to share art~~
Bill: Good idea.
Bill: I'm not going to share.
Bill: Any.
Bill: of my art.
Bill: with you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): you were talking about the nose when you posted it so it reminded me but i don't think there's anything wrong with the nose, i was more poking fun at how your hair was messing with the outline of tom's face
Aldus Larian (Jess): But but
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): like dis
N🆗ri (Marisa): it proves you have good proportions
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: I think taking Marisa's comment out of context assssaaaaaaaaaMarisa why you make the meme worse
N🆗ri (Marisa): art imitates life
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna know how jess draws glasses so well
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do u make a rectangle sideways
Bill: ~~I'm just thinking of a certain Donald Trump quote and how it would totally ruin the romance of this picture~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHOA SPICY 🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NASA pantsu crack me up
Aldus Larian (Jess): I look so....
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uhhhh
N🆗ri (Marisa): good
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea thay
Bill: ecstatic.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea
Bill: Nothing like that Tomu Tumu.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "oh God he finally touched me"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You look like you’re really in the moment
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought it was more “I’m gonna wife this boi” vibes LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): Guys look. My neck
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's there
Bill: I can't see it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): RIP me
Bill: HUSTON WE HAVE NIP NOP
Bill: ...Tom Nop. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't scare me like that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also lemme see
Bill: Just go yeet his shirt off.
Aldus Larian (Jess): He sleep!
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's rude
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh that's like the reverse plot of a new manga i started reading today
it seems good
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): How did you get this picture of me at Tom at exactly 11:00om every week night
Bill: WAAaaaaat the fuck was I thinking marking this for post?
N🆗ri (Marisa): rika messed her up
Aldus Larian (Jess): That you wanted to prove Ethan right
Bill: I can see your neck
N🆗ri (Marisa): "tell ethan......................... to shove it....................." <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Look at that fucking colar one tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wowie I used to not have one of those
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm glad you have a collar bone now
Aldus Larian (Jess): I look like a finger
Bill: YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg 😂
Bill: WOO
Bill: Kappa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom's like "what the fuck"
N🆗ri (Marisa): [sends picture of you looking like a middle finger to ethan]
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao I'm laughing so hard 😂
Bill: Anyway, who wore it better:
Bill: 
Bill: <@!334090409389195266> since you watched new girl.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like nya
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also hello my 3 other chins
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Jess wore it better <:lenny:395307171539189760> <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess is now the New Girl™
Bill: Those aren't double chins girl.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): (~~the joke is they're both named jess~~)
Bill: I swear, if you never want to a boudoir shoot again cause of these I'll cry.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah
Bill: Also lightroom it's awkward either way, but please do not transition onto Tom's crotch I BEG of thee.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The finger one is hilarious though
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'd probably think the glasses one is cute if it wasn't me just I we criticizing myself
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hold on let me have an out of body experience real quick
Aldus Larian (Jess): What you can't see in that picture is the fear in my eyes that Tom will stab me becuase he always put my glasses on wrong
Bill: ~~it's okay, Erik was designated contacts issue person for Zenkai~~
Bill: Nothing like a titty sniff to turn things up in the bed room.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's a kiss billiam
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YALL
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm standing in line to get food at the mall and an old man was behind me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And I opened the tiddy sniff
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm just looking like an idiot just cracking up alone on this line right now
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But I cant stop
Bill: THIS is a kiss you insufferably adorable couple you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok that ones good
Bill: I have issues cause the first thing I heard in my head here was "This is the part. Where you run away." in Shrek's voice.

Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no? LMFAO
Bill: Who is this asian man you getting it on with Jess. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): He look so sleepy
Bill: Girl you look SO MUCH like Zooey Dachanel and that's HIGH PRAISE.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh thank
Aldus Larian (Jess): My hair is basically that color naturally
N🆗ri (Marisa): nice hairstyle <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wish that was my hair
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can borrow mine
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nuuuu das yours!
N🆗ri (Marisa): urs now
Aldus Larian (Jess): I used to have that style when I was little
N🆗ri (Marisa): you betrayed the 'do
Bill: Correction, NOW the 15 year old girls are saying "wish that was me".
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): SPICE
Bill: OH GOD Okay Tom is double jointed at da elbow?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 🌶 🌶 🌶 🌶 🌶
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh hello
Bill: It HIGH KEY looks like he just broke his arm
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think he is? Double joinied?
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom says double jointed is a myth
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok that's really fucking fuck tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I mean it is but it basically just means your ligaments are weak and are flexible
Bill: I can't get over the broken arm thing.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Chris has that too in his arm
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It grosses me out lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's just his elbow, he's a special boi
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Tom's not gross, I dont mean it like that xD rip
Bill: I don't mind it in person, but front and center on the image like that is like TOO much attention to that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But it does look broken is what I mean
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aww RIP
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's such a good pic tho otherwise
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye it is!
Aldus Larian (Jess): At this rate none of these pics are going to survive both mine and birus standards
Bill: ~~You realize when I live blog edits I usually only share the meme content right~~
Bill: I mean, this is way worse than I usually do but I did get a groove further down the line.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The drunker you got?
Bill: yeah actually.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also you underestimate my ability to critize myself
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn now I want straight bangs again but it makes me  look like my mom
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  I had the straight bangs 2 yrs ago!

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nice picture
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): he rises

Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao I shave safe search on so Flickr is like "nope"
Bill: ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): NICE pics
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Bill: They should be marked safe and be visible.
Bill: are they?
Bill: before I go eat dinner?
N🆗ri (Marisa): if they're marked safe and visible then they'd be visible all across flickr, right?
Bill: Private gallery. accessible only with the link.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wew
Bill: can you see Tom and Jess being gay.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh there it is now it's there
Bill: Thank precious bean Mawisa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ya sorry I was trying to do my makeup
Bill: Lol didn’t matter who looked.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omfg the chip ones
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GET THOSE TOE SOCKS OUTTA HERE
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven would wear toe socks
Bill: ~~I did crop them out of a few shots~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't have any control over Tom when he cosplays Seven, all his chaotic energy is able to run rampant
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok these are pretty cute
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have no idea what I'm going to do with them but cute
Bill: ~~anniversary presents~~
Bill: My bet was which of you was going to want a boudoir shoot for the other first.
Bill: I didn’t think that’d actually happen, but I joked about it. Georgia can attest (if she remembers), we talked about a few times.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It was easier together
