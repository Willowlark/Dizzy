NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Thereâ€™s all sorts of chaos in the dangan ronpa group right now. Four people just dropped out and they want everyone to pay the photographerâ€™s cancellation fee
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ahhh noooo!
Bill: YAAAAAY JESSSSS
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): The photographer has a $50 cancellation fee and if we go ahead with the group as it currently is, weâ€™ll only have $56 out of the $110 due to the photog. Some people already paid for the deposit too.
Bill: Oooof
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG wtf noooo
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): The people dropped out reportedly because they couldnâ€™t pay the $13 per person
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ðŸ™ƒ
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But it was stated you'd have to pay since the beginning right?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Yup
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Itâ€™s been out there for weeks, and the photographer only has a cancellation fee for people who cancel after February 1st
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Are you kidding me?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So these people were 5 days past the date
Bill: Sketch man.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): our hajime just posted a one minute long inspirational speech lol

NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): the people who left were even discussing where to meet us 3 hours ago
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): we didn't talk about money at all in between then
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hmmmm
Bill: Thatâ€™s so dumb.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): seriously it's $13. unless they're just cancelling the whole con? but they were making all those plans with us earlier it doesn't make sense.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i feel so bad for the people who already paid
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): because $50 deposit
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That so shitty
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Don't commit to a group photoshoot not you can't do it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): And don't cancel 1.5 weeks before the con
Bill: Yeaaaah hence why I was being annoying about fireball mountain. Which I need to book.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea but that's not for like 4 ? Months?
Bill: Ye. But I still have to put down 100 bucks non refundable.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): the organizer (who took over after the original organizer dropped out) sounds so devastated. they're chatting by leaving voice messages now for some reason and i just feel so bad you can hear her voice shaking, but we're trying to reassure her that those of us left have her back
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): oooooooooooooff i can see why you're hesitant on that
Bill: I mean. Itâ€™s not a big deal.
Bill: I just wanted some commitment before I did it.

Bill: OH MAN.
