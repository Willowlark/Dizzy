Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Although IIRC, the artist alley is not very big
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yay! Congrats! Yea it's not too big but they had some good stuff I think?
Bill: Someone asked about a CCE rwby shoot (Rebecca linked the post) and now someone is asking about Zenkai in a Zenkai group already.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bruh
Bill: Maybe the upswing already started.
Nokri (Marisa): 26 pictures is ok for a group of 3 in half an hour, right? ;u;
i just sent them the pictures im so nervous hhhh
Nokri (Marisa): they're so blurry and grainy hhhhh
Bill: you are above and beyond the norm Mawisa.
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Bill: Considering they're all edited.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah i went back and edited a few this morning out of nerves but i didn't like the second edits so i just kept the first ones
Bill: that's a mood.
Bill: Going back is always stressful.
Nokri (Marisa): if i didn't edit them they'd be atrocious lol
Nokri (Marisa): i like looking at before and afters though it's cool seeing what photoshop does
Nokri (Marisa): [no one looks at the pictures within 30 seconds of sending them]
they hate them. they're awful pictures and they hate me for taking them. rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): nu they dont!
Bill: I think she's actually trying to be sarcastic about it.
Bill: ðŸ˜®
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: my photos aren't amazing out of the camera either, I usually need the exposure tweaking in lightroom before I'm comfortable with them.
Bill: Getting perfect images out of a camera is a hard skill.  It's my like, end goal.
Nokri (Marisa): exposure is the one thing i should probably use the most but i use it the least
Bill: different styles.
Nokri (Marisa): saturation fixes everything
Bill: There is no one, or even better, way of producing a photograph.
Nokri (Marisa): s a t u r a t i o n
