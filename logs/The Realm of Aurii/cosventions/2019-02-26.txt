Bill: Heyyyy she does know who I am when I’m not standing by Georgia.
Erik: she's been in my "people you may know" for like a year lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye me too
Bill: Me too. I finally said fuck it, may as well. I have Jake already and he like, recognizes me on the spot.
Bill: ~~camaraderie between handlers and close friends of famous cosplay girls~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "handlers" *shudder*
Bill: I guess Tom never really had to act as a handler for you in the past.
Bill: You don’t have any super restrictive or complex cosplays right?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): uhh i mean hes helped me carry shit
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but most of the time hes cosplaying too
Bill: Did a scroll, mostly the same stuff she posts publicly.
Bill: I just want to react with a gif of Monoma doing a "cLaSs B iS bEtTeR" freakout.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Time for you to cosplay him fam
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Your time has come
Bill: Rip Mirio
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have no idea what this is but here you go
Bill: That’s scary man.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH
Bill: Ye that guy.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh <@351471675843411978>  I thought you were looking away in that picture for like a solid 10 minutes
Aldus Larian (Jess): me too fam
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Til I realized that the black region was not your pupil
Aldus Larian (Jess): it looks like im looking away
Aldus Larian (Jess): i look derp
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's just the jaypeg of insta
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I checked the original and it doesn't look like that
Bill: Ye Instagram and group shots is a bad mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): shit u ight
Bill: Damn that trippy.
Erik: honestly a lot of the group shots from that shoot are awful
Erik: like she didn't place people well
Erik: so a lot of people get hidden
Bill: Oh really?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wish there were more on the steps
Bill: Who was saying that shoot went well and they were really patient with getting a variety of shots?
Aldus Larian (Jess): uhh me
Bill: Those are two different aspects of the shoot though, can’t compare.
Aldus Larian (Jess): shoot went well but that doesnt mean all the pics are good
Bill: Yeaaaah
Erik: 
Bill: I mean, groups larger than 4 are a crap shoot no matter what.
Erik: valid
Aldus Larian (Jess): rip tokoyami
Bill: Too many people to get them setup well without zooming out to the nines.
Erik: Tokoyami got blocked in so many pictures
Aldus Larian (Jess): also i know im short but i shouldnt have been i the front
Bill: And don’t get me started on how zoomed out shit looks terrible on Instagram, the primary end point of most photos.
Bill: ~~you beeutiful that’s probably why~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~no im just short~~
Erik: yeah the panoramic shots from our Darling shoot don't look good on Insta at all which is why we all have to post the closeups
Bill: Yup.
Erik: like, they're neat for banner photos and even still you have to add a border to the top and bottom
Bill: Unless you plan on making a 13x19 poster print, a large banner style pose is crap.
Bill: I also will not shoot “all” shots at gatherings.
Bill: Cause it’s fucking pointless.
Aldus Larian (Jess): everyone looks fine on the stairs minus me
Bill: (If they’re of a decent size like RWBY or BNHA)
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oof I try to get all shots at gatherings 
Yeah I noticed poor Tokoyami is blocked 😭 
Big groups can be done but it’s best out of conventions because you need a lot of time to set it all up
Aldus Larian (Jess): some cranky girl was all like "Um EXCUME PEOPLE NEED TO WALK DOWN THESE STAIRS"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "people use stairs"
Aldus Larian (Jess): like wowie lady calm down we were her for 2 seconds
N🆗ri (Marisa): The stairs next to the gently sloping ground?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ya? i think idk its like hear that wall of rocks
Erik: part of me is remembering someone literally climbing up or down the wall at one point because we were on the stairs but I can't remember if that actually happened
Aldus Larian (Jess): HUH idk
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH ERIK
Aldus Larian (Jess): that Hak we saw that we thought was hal WASNT HIM
Erik: oh really?
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): OTHER HAK
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA it was someone else
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): This person!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo I know that hak!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Know of them. I think we only met once
Aldus Larian (Jess): they were like possing on the rocks and me and erik swore it was hal
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: Georgia and I were by the rock wall there, someone came up “can we use this spot?” I said sure, let us just finish up. Then she’s like “well we have a limited timeframe for this *paid shoot*” and I was like ....okay, fine.
Bill: Should have told her she was a bitch, but she had a posse of Eevee gijinka and we got a variety of shots.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok but what if your shoot was also paid
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg sounds like the girl who kicked our Steven universe out of its spot for her pony gathering that literally nobody showed up to
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dont understand katsu photo etiquette
Bill: There isn't.
Aldus Larian (Jess): people are rude
Bill: Man, now it bothers me in hindsight. At the time it was fine and we got our photos, but I don't like being told what to do.
Erik: You should have just said that yours was also paid ~~but not tell her it was paid for with friendship~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Paid in blood oath
N🆗ri (Marisa): If the terms and conditions aren’t fulfilled you turn to dust
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): OK GOOD I THOUGHT SHE WAS A BINCH TOO
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like “ummm this is a paid shoot”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _binch so are most of the Katsu shoots, sit ya ass down and wait for the rocks like most people do_
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woah wow
