Bill: Stick with Ochako.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): As a character tho 👏
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Momo pretty lit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just shamefully nakey
Bill: We disagree on that one. It's not Momo's fault, the author just can't write women.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She doesn’t have much screen time but I love what I see
Bill: Her biggest story arc was her getting over the fact she felt inferior to Todoroki by listening to him.
Bill: She's a recommendation student, she shouldn't be immediately cowed by Todo.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She was disillusioned by the fact that she was a recommendation student and couldn’t perform to the standard she wanted

Aldus Larian (Jess): prob not
Bill: But.

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Excessive? Maybe
Bill: ~~I actually went and checked the documentation for the json library~~
Bill: ~~for a bit gag~~
Bill: *And there's still a bug in the code fuck*
Bill: haha it worked!
Aldus Larian (Jess): now you dont want to by it anymore?
