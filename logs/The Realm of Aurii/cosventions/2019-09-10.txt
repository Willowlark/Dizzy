Nokri (Marisa): O wait that’s not getting an anime I got it mixed up with another weight loss manga my bad
Nokri (Marisa): omg i forgot all about this
someone whose never been to conventions asked me to show them what a convention is like, so i was looking through all of ackson's old videos, recognizing a ton of people and thinking about how cool it'd be to be in one. i forgot i was!!
i know i'm definitely in this crowd somewhere, but i forget where and what i was wearing
https://youtu.be/t3wwWU7cMlk?t=91
Nokri (Marisa): i THINK it was feferi and i was mostly covered by someone in front of me
Nokri (Marisa): OH WAIT I SEE MYSELF
Nokri (Marisa): THATS ME
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh it plus sized elf
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I saw that on the manga shelf in the book store  and I gently placed it back
Nokri (Marisa): oh? whatever for?
Nokri (Marisa): must be too powerful
Nokri (Marisa): what a perfect ahiru
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so Echoblaze did a closet Rigby cosplay and it made me remember that I have an actual Mordecai costume but now I want to cosplay a human version of Mordecai
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Trying to find which home stuck is you among the 5 gray pixels
Nokri (Marisa): if u look at the video itself that's only like 1/6 of the meetup
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:rapid:607237006539489310>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): , there's like a 90% chance that your a grey Homestuck and sitting down
Nokri (Marisa): true!!
Nokri (Marisa): i just tried spinel all on, i hate it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
it looks cheap and shiny so i might not wear her as long as i had hoped to
Nokri (Marisa): it screams "halloween costume" quality
Nokri (Marisa): like this
Nokri (Marisa): i'm a little heartbroken about it but i've made tons of terrible costumes so i'll get over it again
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm sure it's great
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I mean she is kinda shiny tho ye?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah she's a gem/rock, that's why i thought the fabric would work. but it just. looks. ew. cheap halloween store outfit quality.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that picture is Photoshopped right? Like, they shopped the costume onto the model
Nokri (Marisa): oooo did they? it's hard to tell but now that you mention it yeah it looks shopped
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or they cut out a girls head and pasted it onto a picture of the dress
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): look at the hair
Nokri (Marisa): a less photoshopped example
Nokri (Marisa): truuu her hair is too perfect
Nokri (Marisa): too cookie cutter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if you look closely at the wrinkles in the right photo, they match up exactly with the left. looks like they put that picture over something and used warping tools to fit it onto a model body
Nokri (Marisa): omg where'd they get the model from then
Nokri (Marisa): some random lady
Nokri (Marisa): from google
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): random_google_girl.jpg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh btw I bought that hoodie. gonna do casual Mordecai sometime

Bill: Wog head for you comes tomorrow Lee. I'll bring to CCE
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ooo!! I forgot about that. Awesome, thank you!!
Bill: Did you want the old one specifically? Just to be sure, since it's been decorated so much lol
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh I dont care either way. Whatever is easiest
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I painted predators helmet on that one I think and the paint ate through the styrofoam that's why it's so creepy LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow NASA did research that actually confirms 4 person teams are the best
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): RWBY you got something right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *whoa, I wonder what working on a team is like...*
Bill: Eh. Most of the teams I’ve worked with were more incompetent than not.
Bill: You aren’t missing much Erik 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but... *shared work load*
Bill: That implies the other team members do the work correctly 🙃
Bill: It’s not an absolute truth tho, just my experience with teamwork
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just think it'd be rad not being a one-man engineering department 🤷
Bill: Ye that'd be better, sorry
Bill: https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/d29xez/clever_way_of_getting_a_high_quality_film_shot_on/ <@!351785752197201920> this should be you
Bill: I should sent the art to Ezcosplay with no context and a glare emoji.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): theres definitely a fridge in the cce rooms?
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): AYY BLESS
Kaio Vermino (Lee): thank you
Aldus Larian (Jess): no prob 🙂
Bill: Ha.
Bill: So. Context, Vincent (evilottojuniorcosplay) and I were saying everyone knows everyone in rwby and he was like “yeah, I recently met lipstick giraffe...” and I laughed. (Nothing bad about you, said you told him his group has a reputation for drunk antics, which, yes)
Bill: That’s like. Someone telling me about meeting Whoozica. Does not compute.
Bill: “I have met them yes, I was in her wedding”
Aldus Larian (Jess): LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): that would be weird
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lee's lots more popular than me though!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): XD He met me several years ago what crack is he on
Nokri (Marisa): trippin' thru time
Aldus Larian (Jess): he was prob drunk XD
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Valid
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Most likely
Bill: You popular too Jess, but the point more to anyone referring to my close friends by Instagram handle lol
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ye that's weird xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea its lil weird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean, I met him at Zenkai last year and then again at CCE last year and then when we did Marauders at Katsu this year, it was the first time he met me lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm like *dude, I gave you back your credit card when you left it at the bar at CCE*
Aldus Larian (Jess): he came up to tom at cce last year i think? and was like "are you Tom Garrity? you come up on my facebook all the time"
Aldus Larian (Jess): and tom was like wtfff
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn u saved a mans life and he cant even remember you
Kaio Vermino (Lee): He has to be like shitcaced 90% of the time if he really doesnt remember any of us lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean i cant remember shit either but damn
Aldus Larian (Jess): its not cuz im drunk tho im just a mess XD
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Lmao xD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok tbf Zenkai he's usually hammered on floor juice with the other Coco (whose name escapes me)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And CCE was... well, CCE
Nokri (Marisa): why would anyone ever drink at cons
this guy sounds scary
Bill: Tim. Is the other coco.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): THAT'S IT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): TIM
Nokri (Marisa): OH the guy with the big minigun? he's always drunk?
Aldus Larian (Jess): hessss a lil intimidating ya
Nokri (Marisa): the autographed minigun?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Tim more so than Vincent
Nokri (Marisa): i know of a few coco's but only because i prop check their miniguns every year
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Vincent intimidated me for awhile so I kinda avoided him so I GUESS it's fair he didnt remember me
Bill: Tim’s the one always drunk, Vincent is the Aku/Bender cosplayer. Vincent not black out the whole weekend like Tim afaik.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ye Tim scared me
Aldus Larian (Jess): they both scare me
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Hes like a bad alcoholic. I dont think I've ever seen him where I cant smell alcohol off him from like 10 feet away
Bill: Vincent likes me for not judging him when he yelled at the ghilies for taking his suit and starting without him. I low key was, but I guess I just handed it we.
Nokri (Marisa): they took his suit? that's a bit messed up
Bill: It was mostly misunderstanding and was fine in the end, but Vincent was pissed.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I'd prob be upset too
Bill: Ye.
Bill: Vincent is better than Tim, is all I wanna get across.
Bill: Tim’s not *bad* afaik, just a drunk
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea I dont have anything against either
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But I'd rather talk to Vincent
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@301927856240459777> Tim was one of the people dropping the "how to spoon" cards at Zenkai
Nokri (Marisa): HE CAUSED SO MANY ISSUES
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ohhhhhh I didnt know that
Nokri (Marisa): STOP THAT TIM
Nokri (Marisa): *90% of the people who look at the ground and pick stuff up are very young children*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah he was saying that con staff caught him when some fell out of his pocket and they told him if they found anymore they'd kick him out and ban him
Nokri (Marisa): all the staff were on really high alert for him
Bill: Now that I’m thinking about it, I think I’ve only been referred to by handle once, David when we first met him
Nokri (Marisa): mr tilt worm
Bill: Seriously referred to
Nokri (Marisa): tapeworm-sama
Bill: “Are you the little things we miss”
Nokri (Marisa): omg that's so good
Bill: And that’s when I realized my handle sucks for a nickname.
Nokri (Marisa): "please, things we miss was my father. call me the little things."
Bill: Snrk
Bill: Mid response to him I said “you know what, just call me Bill.”
Aldus Larian (Jess): "call me little thing"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Call me...
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LMFAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Bill: I hate everything here 🙃😅
Bill: HOW did you manage to find me on Venmo Lee. I’ve used it *Once* XD
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I typed " william"
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And I was like ***ah there he is***
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ***DOXXED***
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:f_respect:575713016297947157>
Bill: > VRV: watch rwby
