Bill: Ezcosplay has a sale right now.
Bill: Everything like 40 bucks off.
Bill: V is on ezcosplay... and I was curious, cause the sweater I have is so smol...
Bill: But it has no actual picture.
Bill: https://www.ezcosplay.com/mystic-messenger-v-cosplay-costume.html
Bill: And like, ez is pretty reliable thus far but. 🤔
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wouldn't buy anything without a pic
Bill: yeee
Bill: Was considering uniforms from BNHA, though the summer one is like... just the lapel things on a white shirt.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Bill: for thirty bucks.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeeeeee no, imma make my own
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly just get a short sleeve dress shirt and add the shoulder things
Bill: ~~or bribe someone to do it for me~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wish I could get just the jacket and pants because shirt and tie are easily obtainable
Bill: I tossed the shirt that came with both uniforms I
Bill: Used a real dress shirt.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd also just do the summer shirt to wear under the jacket when doing winter uniform ~~because then if it gets too hot you can take it off~~
Bill: yeaaaaaah
Bill: Not a bad investment, cause Mirio is important in season 3 so I can keep running with that.
Bill: *Adam's only 113 bucks*
Aldus Larian (Jess): only lol
Bill: down from 163, so...
Aldus Larian (Jess): i understand that but lol
Bill: fair.
Bill: the old outfit is more expensive and that's sort of amusing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye Big Three ~~minus Nejire because women don't matter in BNHA~~ and Kirishima got big parts coming up in Season 4
Bill: I know ye.
Bill: Not that I'mma ever do the hero suit cause *scarring children*.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If Mark can wear a metallic gold spandex zentaisuit, so can you
Aldus Larian (Jess): ☝
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but Mirio's hero suit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not the gold spandex
Bill: Man, part of me wants a beacon uniform cause I'm trash, but the only male to wear it is... Jaune, and I'm not at all feeling him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): speaking of Jaune...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): part of me is feeling the call to cosplay him ~~to replace Hal~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Jaune" is her activation word
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she literally came out of nowhere once Jaune was mentioned
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have conveniently just woken up when this convo started
Bill: He should not be so hard to get... It's just a hoodie and jeans.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Obviously I’d encourage you to do it 😂
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah and based on how you did the chestpiece for goro, you’d have no problem with Jaune
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YE!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could just modify the pattern for that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have leftover spandex for the orange armbands too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably cheat with the sword and just buy a cheap foam one and modify
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont think anyone would blame you lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its so simple its not worth dropping big money on
Bill: It's Jaune, unless you plan on a transforming shield it doesn't matter what you do really.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): get a wig I could also use for Yang
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): A full team JNPR again, hooray 😭
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TRUE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ryan and Hal (once I got one for Hal) both used a Hansel from Arda
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's what I have for Tai
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like Jaune's hair is a little longer tho?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They so good Ye
Bill: Hell you could use Tai.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): eh, never mind
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Uhmmm yes and no, the animation makes it different between 1 and 2
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not really
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah but you wouldn’t wanna take out that SWEET ahoge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nah can't use Tai because
1. already have Tai's cowlicks super glued in place
2. Jaune's hair is yellow instead of blonde
Bill: Ah true.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Especially if you wanted the wig for Yang anyways, I think it’s worth
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jaune is just jeans, hoodie, armor, sword, shield
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *the hooded tee is still available on the RT store...*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I made fem Jaune for like 20 bucks lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OOOO IT IS
Bill: > looks at Leon cosplay from RE2 Remake
> Looks closely
> *"No it really has to be <@!351785752197201920>"*
Bill: Mirio's hero suit on ez is not a zentai suit. It's polyester like everything else.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *do I buy it now at full price and save for when I do Jaune or wait until it goes on sale, risking my size going out of stock by then...*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Treat yo self
Bill: ~~treat her she means~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wouldn’t object to a pocket Jaune 🤷‍♀️
Bill: I'm aware, and you haven't had any good options till Erik.
Bill: Thought Kurtis is talkin about doing the dress from the ball someday.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah really the closest I’ve gotten is that high school kid that thinks I’m awesome but I’m like uhhhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mirio's suit from EZ looks like it'd get VERY hot
Bill: Also would look weird I think, as it's supposed to be a bodysuit.
Bill: That's Jaunes, you could have asked people. But Ryan too busy being Ryan and... yeah.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ryan had no desire to be Jaune til he took off his clothes
Bill: True.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal got kinda butthurt about Ryan being Jaune I remember
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was like _hes gay and one of your besties_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he was like _but I should’ve done that clothes swap with you_
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol
Bill: a memory you must hold dear.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ryan or Hal?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): when I first met y'all I thought Hal was the Jaune in that JNPR set with Gen lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause that Otakon was lit thanks to Ryan
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HA a lot of people did
Bill: And it pissed off Hal.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^^^
Bill: LOL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because I saw those photos from Gen's FB before I met any of you and then when I did I was like *"Oh Hal was that Jaune"* and then I saw the picture again and I was like *that's not Hal*
Bill: I was looking at Chris Redfield from RE5. He has a STARS patch on the shoulder, but in the game it's BSAA.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ryan made that cosplay for Hal tho, to be fair
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I bought him a better wig which coincidentally was the same as Ryan’s
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): whoops, *accidentally* bought the Jaune hooded tee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): should I do his first outfit? second outfit? or wait until the new season for potential 3rd outfit?
Bill: Probably wait, or do the second so you match with Tom and Jess as Renora.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was thinking that
Bill: I dunno if they'll do the new renora.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They might not even give Jaune a new outfit, his is so... feels
Bill: You mean he's so minor a character.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jaune is a pretty important character tho he’s not really minor
Bill: JNR gets little screen time these days.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They're still part of the main group. If RWBY is getting new outfits for Atlas, I'm sure they'd give JNR new outfits as well
Elfriede Faun (Tom): If it's cool we will
Bill: I'd give it a like... 75% percent chance it's a new outfit, 25% it's like just a scarf.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol Rooster Teeth making *cool* outfit designs?
Bill: And Jaune will still be wearing a hoodie.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Although I feel like Jaune's armor is pretty set in stone. Would be kind of dumb for him to get rid of it, especially with it containing Pyrrha metal
Bill: He could add to it, depending on him getting a real fighting style.
Bill: But he's also support main now.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *give him another pauldron*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and better pants than jeans
N🆗ri (Marisa): *they took away pockets* pockets were such a big part of Monty’s character designs
Bill: I'm just flipping through categories right now like... Sure, sale, but why by things I don't have  plan for...
N🆗ri (Marisa): Collect more cosplay. Gotta cosplay them all.
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s still so expensive with the sale though yikes
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is it even really a sale
Bill: tbh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: But like with no one knowing what they're doing CPAC and everyone being disjointed probably I'm like. Not motivated to do anything myself.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have like no new cosplans at the moment
Bill: mm.
Bill: Oh wow, they have Benedict costumes from Violet Evergarden.
Bill: *I have looks at three cosplays for Tom, one for Kurtis, and Popola for I dunno who but someone who'd look cute in it*
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have so many cosplans jess u gotta get some cosplans
Bill: I love how RWBY cosplay is freaking popular that ez sells genderbends and variants.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They sell Henceforward Sun too
Bill: yup.
Bill: Motivation be kinda gone now.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Let’s talk cosplans owo what everyone wanna cosplay in the future?
Bill: I think I'll get the ez BNHA uniform just to have one I can move my arms in, not do anything else.
N🆗ri (Marisa): My coworker had a pair as pajamas they were gonna wear for Halloween but couldn’t do it becuause they felt weird going out in their pajamas
Bill: More like what are CPAC plans.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Justin and I doing star and Marco
Bill: He is coming? Nice.
Bill: *haha* I could be the backup Marco I was last year.
N🆗ri (Marisa): do this marco
Bill: I donated the hoodie forever ago.
Bill: LOL
Bill: I forgot about him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Saturday supposed to be nice. Maybe I'll do casual Kiri again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Mawisa this summer I wanna get spidergwen and v5 yang and lux and fem todo and Megara done oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof rip your wallet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not all will get done
Bill: Just a few things.

Bill: You making spidergwen or buying?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rebecca wanted to be a muse lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Buying
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Her friends call her Meg, if she had any
N🆗ri (Marisa): disney princesses are allowed in anime con contests that say "only japanese sources allowed" because kingdom hearts is their loophole
Bill: Ye not worth making it like you vault suit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they didn't have meg in wir2. so sad.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anext, lux, Yang, Gwen? Otakon Megara, Todo, Dunkin’
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ideally
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rip RTX
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm probably gonna bring pinup captain America out for cpac .... for feels

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Pls send my sweatshirt, thanks
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna cosplay all of these guys some day but idk which to make for next
nanachi is out she'd be way too costly with all that fur, but the rest. should be doable.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> was talking about doing Shield Hero so you could time Raphtalia with him.
Bill: Where's the swords girl from?
N🆗ri (Marisa): **raphtaliaaaaaaaaaaaaa**
Bill: I feel like I've seen her.
Bill: Ooooh you're going to do the lying princess?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ohhhhh I like the girl in the bottom right
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's a cute outfit
Bill: Ye.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): All
Bill: Mawisa has good (if furry) taste.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!! she's getting an anime!! i love the hanako-kun manga it's gonna be fantastic anime
N🆗ri (Marisa): liar princess will be easy i almost made her when i went to make dani but i wanted to play the game first
N🆗ri (Marisa): there was a liar princess and blind prince at kogara!!
Bill: I'm sorry?
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH THAT'S IT
N🆗ri (Marisa): IT'S AWESOME
N🆗ri (Marisa): IT'S SO CUTE
N🆗ri (Marisa): AND TRAGIC
N🆗ri (Marisa): my children
Bill: ~~are cosplaying children again~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i ate at the cafe and they had a radish soup dish for nene because they always make fun of her fat ankles that look like radishes and i physically perished while eating the soup
N🆗ri (Marisa): YOU SHUSH
N🆗ri (Marisa): SILENCE
Bill: I am op you cannot silence me.
Bill: Oh, I looked at the clannad uniforms for a hot second.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i have one of those
Bill: I was telling someone the only way I'd do it is if I get to stick juice boxes up your nose.
Bill: *But it's canon*
N🆗ri (Marisa): hashtag fuko deserves better
Aldus Larian (Jess): the only characters ive wanted to cosplay lately have been bois and i dont look that great as a boy
Andrew: Am definitely looking into naofumi. Thinking about making most of it not buying tho
Andrew: I want to try using LEDs on the shield
Bill: Kiiiinda wanna go back and get the chris redfield top for RE5... But he's not my favorite guy and RE5 is the worst game so like... ugh;;
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess what bois you wanna cosplay? we make u mega handsome
N🆗ri (Marisa): LED SHIELD LED SHIELD
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~jess be toiled bound hanako-kun~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): but ive never read dat
Bill: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2019-Game-Resident-Evil-2-Cosplay-Remake-Tyrant-Cosplay-Costume-Halloween-Carnival-Party-For-Adult-Men/32991253189.html what this exists
N🆗ri (Marisa): guess what today is great for
N🆗ri (Marisa): color: male or female
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~doing this flyer that my boss spent 2 hours yelling at me about on thursday?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah
Bill: I don
Bill: I'm guessing i can't trust the fact that theres no reviews on it tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the seller has decent reviews, check out reviews on their other custom pieces
Bill: > posts photo of self
> loses two followers
Bill: If they can't appreciate T posing I don't want em though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): every post comes with unfollows <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): why they even follow in the first place them
Bill: Who cares. Followers aren’t people :dab
N🆗ri (Marisa): bots? :0
Bill: Dizzy is most assuredly a person how dare you!
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah she runs the masquerade at most east coast cons
Bill: aww. The new york cherry festival is this weekend too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've wanted to do ahiru's school uniform too. everyone always does her princess tutu outfit but the school uniform is neat
N🆗ri (Marisa): >goes around quacking at everyone
Bill: What even lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): she's a duck who was turned into a magical girl by a fairy tale author so whenever she quacks at someone she turns into a duck
N🆗ri (Marisa): makes for some great scenes in the anime, like:
fakir: "hey muto (ahiru's crush)... did you know... that princess tutu..."
ahiru: [shocked quacked and transformation into a duck]
fakir: "is flying through the sky right now?" [turns muto around to face the sky]

good times
N🆗ri (Marisa): has anyone ever cosplayed the canon genderbent soul eater designs
N🆗ri (Marisa): that'd be neat to see
N🆗ri (Marisa): male tsubaki is ren
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TRUE
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's just ren and nora
tsubaki and black⭐star are just ren and nora how have we never noticed this
Glonk: Those followers we're probably bots anyway
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Remember that in that part in the manga they look like what they most find attractive in the opposite sex 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): soul are maka are pure
everyone else is sin
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh i'd love to do capri someday but she is literally everything that i'm not
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone cosplay capri
Aldus Larian (Jess): who?
N🆗ri (Marisa): not the adult version that's just shounen cliche, but like her younger version
she's definitely not a child furry
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Cosplay Capri Sun-chan
Bill: How do I convince everyone to cosplay resident evil.
Andrew: I dunno how youd convince me but I'm curious what convincing me would look like
Bill: *i gave up on your poor taste when you kept blowing off Rwby*
N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw only good full body pictures i can find of capri are of her in despair
N🆗ri (Marisa): art is like that because same author as zatch bell
Andrew: >kept blowing off rwby

>past tense
N🆗ri (Marisa): would it be bad if i made a cc cosplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): bad?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye that's your thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol ive never even done a full cc cosplay gurl
N🆗ri (Marisa): cce!
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom and i are planning to do them after the release of the movie? i think?
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was like cc light tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): you can def cosplay her!
N🆗ri (Marisa): are u sure
i def wouldn't be as good as you but i used to want to cosplay her and i was thinking about doing Zero CC for next
Aldus Larian (Jess): toms trying to avoid spoilers but he saw some promo art where they had matching outfits so we might do those
Aldus Larian (Jess): of course im sure silly!
Aldus Larian (Jess): cosplay whatever you want, youll make a great cc
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've got jess's blessing <:pwease:555585508819075112>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just gotta figure out how to make the helment dark yet still see-out-able
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): holy baloney sakura sunday was my 51st con
Bill: time to quit and be a normie.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): http://fairmountwaterworks.org/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!184437198865563648> i found that spot i passed on the way to the cherry blossom festivl
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): photo potential or nah?
Bill: it could wokr.
Bill: Overhangs, columns, railings, the water itself...
Bill: oof the trolley graveyard is so far away.
Bill: Were you thinking of something specific there Georgia?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YAYAYAYA CC
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'll do cc too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Well all do cc
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
Bill: SO much green hair.
N🆗ri (Marisa): EVERONE PICK AN OUTFIT
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm torn between CC and Raphtalia, with Yashiro and/or Liar Princess as a side project
for CC it's the mask that'll be hard. I figure I can make the visor with a fish bowl or a clear lamp cover and then cover it inside with cellophane or glass stainer but I don't have the tools to cut glass or plastic properly, I fear it'll crack
for Raphtalia it's just a lot of work to make the tail and the chestpiece but I can do it with the tools I have. I wanna try wig ventilating techniques with yarn to make the tail maybe.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh and her sword!! i'm looking at stuff for that now
N🆗ri (Marisa): i need to go to home depot
N🆗ri (Marisa): metal isn't allowed at cons and i obviously have nothing to cut metal with so i'm looking at silicone stuff for the sword
N🆗ri (Marisa): this silicone stuff is too short, sword blades are typically 28+ inches and these are only 21 <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I love how the episode where she takes over as zero she takes the helmet off and all her hair falls out
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Like bitch no way you got that on without a ponytail or bun
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just imagine her stuffing all her hair into the helmet
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH I WANNA DO THAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was trying to figure out how to do that so that when i'm on stage i could be like FWOOSH
N🆗ri (Marisa): totally realistic she woke up like that
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe a pin that's attached to the helmet via elastic so she can pin her hair with the helmet off and then when she takes the helmet off the pin comes out of her hair <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Absolutely 👍
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Must be it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): With the Greek architecture? Prob Pyrrha
Bill: it'd be a nice spot for it. It's so close to the sakura sunday site I'd want to visit the shofuso house.
N🆗ri (Marisa): shofuso house shoot? 👀
Bill: We can't book the place, but if you go in a small group they'll let you shoot if you aren't in the way and don't touch anything.
Bill: Shofuso.
Bill: Water works is open to the public.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I didn’t see a photography policy for water works either
Bill: Nope. Should be fine then.
Andrew: I want to join you for shofuso
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye the shofuso seemed cool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I could use that yukata from Sakura Sunday again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): For Ochako or just georgia
Bill: It can’t be more 3 or 4 people.
Bill: I still can’t imagine how you look as just Georgia in that.
Bill: It just doesn’t click.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao like that
Bill: Riiiight but like with your hair down like you would for a shoot.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh yeah you posted that right
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah I guess
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just photoshop my face from normiecon onto that pic boom lol
Bill: Not saying it’d be bad I just can’t picture it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): longer hair usually worn up in yukata so that'd be a good way to wear it as u
Bill: Maybe that’s why I can’t imagine it but.
Bill: I’d still like to see it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What do you mean?
Aldus Larian (Jess): She's right there in da pic with no wog
Bill: With hair *down*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *she is beauty, she is grace*
Bill: *That's the shot to use?*
N🆗ri (Marisa): do these look like the same-ish shade
Bill: yea.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and do they match raphtalia <:thinku:543194478614413318> her hair looks like a different color in every pic
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/453/069/e30.gif
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Why is this the first result when searching Raphtalia
N🆗ri (Marisa): evil
evil evil
Andrew: Because the internet
N🆗ri (Marisa): her hair is like. slightly lighter than holo's i think. but it looks best as brown on cosplayers.
it's darker in the novel if i recall
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, it looks nearly blonde here
Andrew: I think its definitely on the darker brown side
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah. this cosplayer has a spot-on wig but somehow the second one looks more accurate
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: *spooky eyes*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think worldcosplay is down wretrhj i can't access the site to stare at cosplayers
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to hit archive
Andrew: The bottom one looks really good
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i was worried the stuff i picked out would be too dark but it seems to be ok
and if it is i can bury it in some talcum powder and brush it out again
Andrew: Oh is that how you get it lighter
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it lightens wigs a bit (all the white powder) and makes them less shiny but also makes them smell strongly of talcum powder and you'll be sneezing for days
N🆗ri (Marisa): i may have made a girl sneeze uncontrollably at comiket but there's no 100% certainty that was me. sorry.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL THANKS ERIK
Andrew: Lol
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You just gotta edit every picture to be slightly different color is all
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): buy several different wigs and swap them out during shoots
Bill: Oh oof I don’t look good in V.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u do
Bill: Not correct.
Bill: I don’t look good with bangs cause it rounds out my face into a big circle of blah.
Bill: Mirio hazel and Barry all good cosplays cause they have foreheads.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Oof please no.
N🆗ri (Marisa): forehead
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yoooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Code lyoko used to be my shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I need to see an edited version where the facial features are correctly placed
Bill: Ooooo. The effect may be more pronounced cause Georgia shooting from below me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like how in the promo pictures, the one guy who never went into the virtual world is the only 2d character
N🆗ri (Marisa): he went in like once i remember but that's it
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA jeramy!
Aldus Larian (Jess): He has short pants
Aldus Larian (Jess): No idea why, always bothered me
N🆗ri (Marisa): because he has a normal forehead
N🆗ri (Marisa): forehead or pants you must pick one
Aldus Larian (Jess): It was really bad cuz I would use code lyoko characters to learn how to draw so like all my drawings had really big foreheads
Aldus Larian (Jess): I had a drawing of the the characters that took me forever cuz I could not get jeremys glasses write and eventually I had erased it so many times there was like no paper left
N🆗ri (Marisa): [erases jeremy out] the gang's all here
Aldus Larian (Jess): That was the source of so much frustration
Aldus Larian (Jess): I always wanted to see the show in order but cartoon Network always just played a random episode
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): yolo episode order
Aldus Larian (Jess): I never got alitas full backstory
Aldus Larian (Jess): Rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): i didn't even realize there was a coherent plot for years
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG right
Bill: Wow what a perfect image.
N🆗ri (Marisa): hhhhhhhhhhhhhideous
N🆗ri (Marisa): it burn
N🆗ri (Marisa): s
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Pretty lady
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think something's wrong my sasuke keeps disappearing
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): i must protect the innocent
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): raphtalia is more achievable for next. considering getting wonderflex for her chestplate because i know plain foam will crack like it did for nia. maybe that be my birthday present to myself.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Justin just texted me “when can I cosplay Jaune”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _whats got everyone in a Jaune mood today_
N🆗ri (Marisa): right now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _slam dunks a wig on his head_
Bill: I still owe you a Christmas present of a Joann’s gift card.
Bill: Good for you Georgia.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow so nice of you to buy presents for not me
Bill: For you, you insufferable troll you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh for you nice
Bill: *are you calling me a troll you homestuck*
Andrew: how did i miss a code lyoko conversation
Bill: There she is!!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): The rice krispie angel!
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow biru is a homestuck!?
