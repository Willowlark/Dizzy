Bill: I dunno what the hell im doing tomorrow, but I’m thinking it may end at recess. <@!350855105123319808> <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> Latter In the chance you’d like to go out with Aliza in the evening Jessjess.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hmm ok, Aliza mentioned she doesn't really gave the money to go drinking right now but we'll see
Bill: Just letting you know. Don’t want to ping that bar chat because *Leanna not supposed to know I’m just blowing it off*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Your allowed to just not go somewhere lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): You don't gotta have an excuse
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ☝️
Bill: Faiiiir but I don’t need to make my motives known to the group at large. I’m secretive too.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "im not going" *is* secretive 😂
Bill: *But that’s not what I saaaaid*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *that's our point*
Bill: I set it up to say “I’d need a Christmas miracle, I have to do a rollout for work” if anyone questioned it.
Bill: ~~But no ones really going to miss me so they didn’t ask~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea but like why?
Bill: The obvious assumption would be that I’m not going because you are. People could assume then that I was only going for you guys. Especially once Georgia isn’t showing up. Which isn’t entirely true, there are some people I would enjoy seeing. So I built in a counter to the assumptions.
Bill: ~~I’m paranoid and can be manipulative in my wordings to protect myself.~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): From what though? The truth is a good enough excuse "I don't want to make a 2 hour trip alone since Tom and Jess arnr going I'll probably sir it out cuz of that" you do you bra, I'm just saying the lie was unnecessary
Bill: I’m on record saying that long drives aren’t a problem for me.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You can change your mind though? You can not feel up to it?
Bill: Yeah but then they can say I skip things and stop inviting me places! Forever!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Bruh
Bill: ~~what makes you think I have healthy interactions with people~~
Bill: Or self worth? Something.
