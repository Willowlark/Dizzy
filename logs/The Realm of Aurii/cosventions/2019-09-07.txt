Bill: I don’t have any normal cosplay ideas for CCE.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cosplay biru <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: I mean yes but it’s a rare opportunity to not have gear on me most of the day. ~~Though I’m planning minimal shooting Katsu and Claude memeing so I guess it’s not that rare~~
Bill: Guess it doesn’t really matter.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You could just bring one as backup
Nokri (Marisa): there's still plenty of time to make something
Andrew: Get sewing
Bill: At the last possible second, spotted rwby cosplay
Kaio Vermino (Lee): -insert "adam" vine-
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Thank you xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Bill: So tired. So renn faire. 
Like:
Swords
Falconry
Guy setting a Guinness world record with flaming whips
Cool thrones for photos
Totally different things in the shops
Swords

Could be better:
Sam Ryan and friends I didn’t know were coming are “panel” people and some of the comedy shows were really meh
I wanted a leather journal cover but not for 80 bucks
Hard to tell whose dressed up, and whose in a cosplay and is cool with photos. 
Def miss my “photoshoot” people and that part of a “con” 

Notes:
That’s alotta fucking corsets. You can put together some cute outfits at a renn faire damn. 
*fucking swords*
Bill: Was cool.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They sell a Halo energy sword at the PA one for $60 and honestly I'd buy it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Anodized and cool af
Bill: Master sword was 60 too!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): For a metal weapon, not a bad price
Bill: Nope. It’ll be nice, I’ve wanted one for years but was waiting till I had my own place.
Bill: Ah. Sam and crew are going home rather than to the restaurant I’m at since his migraine is kicking his ass. The alternate, Dad and Katy, ate before. 😅
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's how I was with the energy sword xD
