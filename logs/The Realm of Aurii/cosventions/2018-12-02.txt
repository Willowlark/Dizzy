Bill: Whatâ€™s the consensus for Konkon at...?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Pretty no
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Aliza just asked Jess to hang out that day
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And she hasn't seen her since she got back from.japan
Bill: Hmmu... if it wasnâ€™t happening Iâ€™d have suggested doing something more locally (and less exciting as this weekend) but if Jess is out...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I've been meaning to get together with her for like 4 months so ðŸ˜…
Bill: Mm, I recall. I kinda want to go for Erikâ€™s Christmas Kiri, cause itâ€™ll be a one time only, but two hour drive, alone, missing ~~support system~~ crew in at least you two... hard to be excite.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea :/ weighing pros and cons and it just doesn't seem like many pros
Bill: Itâ€™d be better than doing nothing here, at least for me, so Iâ€™d want to find alternative plans.
