Andrew: for zenkai, johns waiting on a personal mattter to resolve atm
Bill: Oooh. Oops. I just removed him from the group chat cause he’s been ignoring pings.
Bill: He can check in later I’ll add him back. Better than being in a chat for a room he’s not staying in.
Bill: Damn I wish I got that third room for next...
Andrew: his personal matter resolved, hes just waiting for his vacaiton to be approved
Bill: And I'm guessing he's in for Next too.
Andrew: He is in for NEXT

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): unless im in the tristate
Bill: Oh wait okay, we only had 11 people at Next last year so there's still a floating spot. We're good even with Kurto and Mawisa.

N🆗ri (Marisa): [points at #12] that's me
Bill: ditto Ota?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i would like to join for ota yes pls
Bill: so we has this for Ota. Sofabed, king bed suite. Two of them.
Bill: Whooooo thinks an air mattress will fit in there somehow.
Bill: Cause that changes the cap from 8 to 12.
Bill: Or we could triple the king with the smol people.
Bill: nah to the latter.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is the couch a bed?
Bill: yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o ye u said that oops
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that a desk in the bedroom or another couch
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo and there's an armchair
Bill: Dresser.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: I'm guessing we could get the air mattress in there. The otakon list is 7 right now, butttt I know Leanna was interested and we'll have to see if Erik wants to properly stay at Ota this year...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 7 and one room or 7 in 2 rooms?
Bill: 2 rooms, god not 7 in one room.
Bill: It's two suites.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is that a mini kitchen? 👀
Bill: suite so probably.
Bill: air mattress tho. Think it'd work?
N🆗ri (Marisa): y no 7 in one room
Bill: We are old and our backs break easily.
N🆗ri (Marisa): would need to do some furniture arranging for an air mattress but the furniture might be bolted down
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think we'd be fine?
Bill: ~~could see how much Erik likes that sleeping bag~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 2 in bed, 2 in other bed, 2 on sofa bed, 1 in Other sofabed
Bill: I'm talking about if more people wanted to join.
Bill: Namely, Erik, Leanna. Kurtis maaaaaybe?
N🆗ri (Marisa): are there two beds per room? looks like one bed and one sofa bed?
oooo two rooms nvm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooooo
Bill: I think we can stay 5 to a room... may need like, Dave's single air mattress or a sleeping bag but that'll. function.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Dave might need his air mattress, not sure
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): If room is too packed Tom and I could get our own somewhere else I suppose
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: It's not promised to more than the cap right now.
Bill: I just want to know what I'm comfortable offering for it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that room is huge. easily 10 people per room.
Bill: *Serious responses only*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's so oddly shaped though
N🆗ri (Marisa): ez
Bill: No.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 9 could also go under the dining table if 10 wants more leg room
Bill: For anyone curious, the pool of people in my con block is 14. Like, no questions they in people. So we get 4 more, that's three rooms at any given con. And also the cap.
Bill: Animenext is the most consistent group.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I would also like to go Otakon if I could
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But the circumstances for that are if I’m in New Jersey
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Or Maryland
Bill: You're already included.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But if I’m in Maryland I’ll have my own apartment 20 mins from con to begin with so idk
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): O THANK
Bill: Otakon is ```1. Bill Clark
2. Jess Garrity
3. Tom Garrity
4. Dave Cruz
5. Georgia Sandidge
6. Andrew Weindel
7. Marisa Ditkoff```
Dirty Lego (Tom): Dave's prob staying with Dan and Ash
Bill: Oh?
Dirty Lego (Tom): He said that before I believe
Bill: *How dare he*
Bill: But also mmkay.
Bill: I'm not addressing it right now, but Leanna/Erik expressed interest before so they can fill spots.
Bill: I'm updating the circuit list with the people for all the cons. CCE, Next, Zenkai are pretty much confirmed at this point.
Bill: and the pin DOES in fact work now. :3
Bill: This post is like a year old what
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is such a good
Bill: True
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jump shots seem to be really popular in japan right now I’m seeing a lot of them today
N🆗ri (Marisa): And these totally innocent school kids. Lovely.
Bill: So innocent.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg did anybody go to the official bnha meetup at katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Soooo Tristan?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is that who that is
Absolute mad man
Bill: John G is in if he gets off work, so that’s 11. I don’t particularly want to offer to him. I like him, but I’d prefer the people I know well at Zenkai.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Soooo no
Bill: Yeah no. This way we’re covered for Aaron changing his mind, and future proofed if Marisa quits staff.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Is she thinking about quitting?
Bill: She mentioned she might for next year.
Bill: Don’t want to set precedence. If someone comes one year, kicking them out later isn’t really an option. I don’t consider that fair.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tristan said he doesn’t expect a room invite any year
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s why he hadn’t planned on Katsu til we invited him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I just think you don’t like him .-.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It would be fine with him if we just went “hey just letting you know that we have a full room next year” is probably fine by him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It gives him time to look for another, should he choose to go to Zenkai next year
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk it seems silly to deny someone room space this year just because you want someone else there next year .-.
N🆗ri (Marisa): more people means cheaper room ya?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye tho the cost isn’t exorbitant this time around
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I thought Tristan was funny and polite and chill, all the things I’d want in a con roomie
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Didn’t even use the make up mirror which is helpful to those of us that do
Bill: I like Tristan, whether or not you think so. I have always been about smaller groups of close friends. That hasn’t changed. As much as I do like him I don’t know him very well and I enjoy rooming with people I care about. 

Nor am I denying him anything. Unless you already told him we’ve got a floating spot.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I didn’t commit to anything but he was interested in going to Zenkai cause we were dating
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): To be fair he should’ve asked if we had space
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But idk your friend isn’t going, Marisa’s still on staff, we have the room anyways; and if he doesn’t room with us idk who he can ask on such short notice
Dirty Lego (Tom): YO THAT HIGURASHI SHOOT IS SO GOOD
Dirty Lego (Tom): What kinda school dress code is this
Dirty Lego (Tom): Everyone wears uniforms from different schools
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH even the twins are in different uniforms what is this
Dirty Lego (Tom): That's so they can switch clothes and hairstyles and you'll never know <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I wanna post new stuff to insta but I don't know what to start with 😂
Bill: Every poster I bought at Katsu is a weird size.
Bill: Why did I buy small ones, I have no idea where to put them.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do you guys think i should wear a less red lipstick next time?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wait you can see it more in this one
Bill: Nah. I like it the shade it's at.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye is good!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Someone at the shoot complimented my contour and I died
N🆗ri (Marisa): on fleek
Bill: Yeah your makeup was great. I like the shade cause it keeps your lips different from the pink skin.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA that's what I thought cuz like my lips just kinda disappeared
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Then again anime characters don't have lips
N🆗ri (Marisa): classic homestuck trick
N🆗ri (Marisa): we should start planning for 4/13
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ok I'm ready
N🆗ri (Marisa): **she's ready**
N🆗ri (Marisa): other fandoms trying to contain homestucks on 4/13 be like

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IT GOOD
