No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Ok so you might’ve seen the official zenkai post, the comments of which are a total mess.

Greggo and his wife?girlfriend?partner? raise(d) foster cats. Greggo has been having some mental issues for a while, and it recently manifested as him strangling one of the cats. He took this as the ultimate sign he needed help (thus retiring from the con circuit). He turned himself into the police for hurting the cat. The cat was injured but not killed, and the other cats are fine. 

People are spreading misinformation, like that the police found 8 dead cats in his house and stuff, and journalism headlines never paint anyone in a good light so that’s causing a lot of misinformation to be spread as well.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): 
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): The con handled it perfectly fine by just announcing he won’t be attending anymore and everyone’s going on a witch hunt
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Ah ofc
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): O my friend used to like in Morgantown WV lol. Anyway that's bull shit what are people mad at zenkai? Amd while of course strangling a cat is not ok I'm glad he recognized it and is going to get help
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah people were like "omg zenkaikon you have to call him out for being a horrible person and ban him forever"
but like. he knew it was bad, he turned himself in for a crime no one would've known about otherwise and sure it's bad but at least the cat didn't die. this is a super grey area and people are treating it like he's the worst human ever
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I mean he fucked up, but he owned up and is gonna get help. People are dicks
Bill: I almost clicked yes on Tyler’s “whose going to be an ANYC” until I saw the text about hit him or Brandon up to party and the affirmative would have been to party.
Bill: Not that I got anything strictly against it, but I thought it was a much more mundane affirmation.
