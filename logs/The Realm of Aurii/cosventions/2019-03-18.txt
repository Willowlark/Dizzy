Bill: Did a whole series of these at the workshop and like. 👌
Bill: That's a raw image.
N🆗ri (Marisa): shoujo manga eyes
Bill: This one with fill flash is also nicu.
Bill: 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Damn no "gotem"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damn
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I hope he found many of those
Bill: I wonder if she caught on that I was just *done* with that shoot .Its probably just caption talk. It. Definitely is.
Bill: Trying to make a lineup post in traffic and all the apps don’t have a layout I want.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ooo maybe i should make a lineup too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~but i'm still unsure if im gonna bring penny at all yet~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): what apps does everyone use for that?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I use pic stitch
Bill: ~~I figure maybe someone will volunteer to shoot a thing if I wisecrack about how I can’t shoot my own cosplays~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Microsoft Powerpoint
Bill: <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Someone suggested using Powerpoint to make event posters when I was in college and honestly it works pretty well
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's not a bad idea, I usually just do mine straight in my phone. Or I'll use illustrator if I need too
N🆗ri (Marisa): PicsArt or that first website that comes up when you google “collage maker” even though it sucks now because paid tiers
PowerPoint is a cool idea
Bill: Pic stitch doesn’t have it either.
Bill: Why.
Bill: Rar.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What all out do u want
Bill: I found one that worked. I was looking for three column, center divided horizontally.
N🆗ri (Marisa): like a fighting game lineup
Bill: Also downside to college apps, they do square formatting not story format.
N🆗ri (Marisa): picsart does
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): PhotoGrid does too but they probably don't have the layout you want
Bill: Inb4 Hunter DMs me his rates. 😏
N🆗ri (Marisa): my lineup is so empty
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm only halfway done meowth and swablu so if i don't finish them or i really hate how they turn out i'll do jaehee but i'll probably finish them.
Bill: Empty for you is a challenge for everyone else.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but is easy it's only 2-3, maybe4 costumes a day
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm coordinating eyebrows so it's easier
N🆗ri (Marisa): i found my pokemon clip-on earrings from japan! they're little pokeballs that dangle down and spin
N🆗ri (Marisa): after a few hours i can't feel my ears but that's fine
Bill: Oh cute.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): tracking says Jumin wig is expected today but it only arrived in Reading this morning so I'm guessing it'll be out for delivery tomorrow
Bill: I should get V today.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait, belay that. now it says out for delivery
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *y e e t*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I know they probably won't, but I'm hoping they look as good as the pictures show ~~even though that's probably after serious styling~~
Bill: Pilot boi helm comes today too.
Bill: ~~rip me if styling required~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): luckily V's doesn't look like it would require too much styling?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jumin's got the swoopy waves
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I'll just put it on and do my normal hair styling~~
Bill: ~~I'll just beg Jess or Marisa or Leanna to do it~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): channel your inner anime
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:5142_then_perish:554720548274569246>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i'm kidding, i'll always help~~
Bill: *Scratch beg, I'll threaten Marisa with Dominos orders to her house*
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH apparently my new 707 wig was delivered yesterday but i never checked the mail
Bill: *For every day the wig isn't styled, the hostage gets fed!*
N🆗ri (Marisa): **pls no**
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Woo my todo boots come today too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): FECK I gotta order my Starfire paint I almost forgot
N🆗ri (Marisa): hewwo did discord die
N🆗ri (Marisa): just a big one one big potato
N🆗ri (Marisa): why is nothing posting <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): the most important part isn't posting help
Bill: big *post*ato.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i might be able to eat after 3pm
N🆗ri (Marisa): wew there it is
Bill: I gotta flatten down the sides of the Mirio wig too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia oh no u gotta hurry the con is in 3 days
Bill: *Your eating right Marisa*
N🆗ri (Marisa): no im at work i can't until 3
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's unprofessional
Bill: I'm *literally* eating right now.
N🆗ri (Marisa): lonch time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My order for face paint is placed and will arrive tomorrow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Huzzah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I love working the back room at work because I can listen to music and be on discord and just shred papers
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So peaceful
Bill: That's just work to me.
Bill: For V, black sneakers or my converse from the wedding? Since I dug out the converse and they seem to fit better than I remember.
N🆗ri (Marisa): which version were you doing again?
it's so hard to find pics with their shoes
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh that's a big picture
N🆗ri (Marisa): oops
Aldus Larian (Jess): id say it doesn't really matter
Bill: Mmkay. Imma do converse then cause they less bulky.
N🆗ri (Marisa): v would wear fancy brands like that ya
N🆗ri (Marisa): he never wears proper clothes but they always cost like $10,000
N🆗ri (Marisa): wears a $7,000 black t-shirt to the party
Bill: Me tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): v is hobo chic he spend thousands of dallars to look poor and lives in the woods
Bill: I'm not looking forward to packing for Zenkai... I doubt I'm going to get away with my duffel this time around.
Aldus Larian (Jess): welcome to cosplay!
Aldus Larian (Jess): o right i was suppoesed tog et a real suit case whopps
Bill: I have a roller suitcase... The camera backpack should hold my computer gear (take that out when I get to the room, but for transport) but I still need something else for the light stands/umbrellas...
Bill: I used a backpack before but can't double down on that, they too tall for a messenger.
Bill: The kit came with a big boxy canvas carry bag but it too big for the smaller loadout...
Bill: and the goal is still to be able to stairs.
Bill: oof.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg yeah zenkaikon's elevators are the worst
N🆗ri (Marisa): lik katsu
Bill: oh wait... I could use two backpacks if I stick the camera bag through the handle on the roller luggage, it's got a strap for that...
Bill: I'm still pissed I needed to buy MORE light stands.
Bill: The ones from the fucking kit I ordered don't have a screw mount like *every lightstand ever*, they have bulb mounts that screw onto the top the stand.
Bill: So I can't mount the flashes on those light stands, cause the flash mounts need a screw mount.
N🆗ri (Marisa): does tape work
Bill: barely.
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to break out the glue gun
Bill: That'd ruin the stands for the softboxes/umbrella mounts.
Aldus Larian (Jess): on a scale of one to ten how bad is this eye edit
Bill: 0.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o it look good
N🆗ri (Marisa): what software u using?
Aldus Larian (Jess): photoshop
N🆗ri (Marisa): i usually set the layer to hue or color or somethin, or lower the opacity to about 50-80%
N🆗ri (Marisa): if it's on normal
N🆗ri (Marisa): but that pic looks good
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): there he is the mint eye
Aldus Larian (Jess): i put it on low opacity and kinda did layers on it so it want all one shade
Bill: lol photoshop is hard.
Bill: I'd do that with a spot edit and saturation/hue/tint idk.
Bill: Fuck with shit in lightroom.
Bill: I should learn to use presets.
N🆗ri (Marisa): perfect365 is good for changing eye colors
Bill: So flora offered to trade me shoot if ended up cosplaying... <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> if she’s okay with it maybe big 3? Like 5 or 6?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea basically the same thing
Bill: Haven’t asked her yet if she’s mind it being a group.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 5 or 6 would be better
Bill: Wait what?
Bill: No alternative lol.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh sorry i read 3 as a time cuz my boss was in here
Aldus Larian (Jess): would perfect 365 work on none selfies or where there are are 2 or more people in the pic?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i fond that alot of apps dont work well with non selfies
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you guys are cosplaying it that late i can also take pictures if there's light after 7
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm <:thinku:543194478614413318> i've used it on non-selfies, and on selfies with 2+ people in the picture, but never with non-selfies that have two or more people in the picture. i assume it would work though
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo neato
Aldus Larian (Jess): toms eyes are hard to edit cuz idk where his pupil ends and his iris starts if light inst in his eyes
Bill: So ask her if she cool with it Jess?
Bill: And YAS Mawisa of course.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea sure!
Bill: Sunset is 7:20 tho so you gotta do a sprinty boi.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can run in heels i shall nyoom
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant tell if this is appropriately creepy  or too far
N🆗ri (Marisa): just gotta find somewhere to take off my staff shirt, there's a bathroom right across the way
N🆗ri (Marisa): def creepy <:pew:543202259085950996> in a good way
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof i thought this pic was too fitting as it was
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh the only thing perfect365 has trouble with is hair in the eyes <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): lemme example
N🆗ri (Marisa): nvm they might've fixed that issue it's working much better
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo neato yea i would asume it might have issues with that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I tried Perfect360
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't know how to feel...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's a little unsettling
N🆗ri (Marisa): perfect ~~360~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): but like it look good
Aldus Larian (Jess): i should tom my edit and he hates it XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): This app?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee
N🆗ri (Marisa): when you first open it it gives you a mega makeover but just move the options left until it says "original" and then click on tools
N🆗ri (Marisa): It does stuff like this lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): NICE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Default mega makeover
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you look fabulous
N🆗ri (Marisa): the lips through the glass are a nice touch
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The lipstick over the wine glass is a nice touch
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/fight-yourself-spiderman-point-gif-12688624
Aldus Larian (Jess): you are beautiful
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): now we talkin
N🆗ri (Marisa): am glad i'm not the only one who erases under eye circles
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~Don't get strung out by the way I look
Don't judge a book by its cover~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no def not mine are terrible, i try to not let it bother me but ive been editing them out lately
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i do too sometimes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if i was exceptionally exhausted
N🆗ri (Marisa): i always edit it out
not only on pictures of me but on images i take too 👀
Bill: Flora said she can’t do it at 5 cause she have to line up for cosplay contest. Can do 4?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo she's gonna be in the masquerade!!!!! aaaaaaa i wanna seeeeeeee
Bill: Little early imo but what you feeling?
Bill: Well. That’s an hour after RWBY shoot. Time to mingle, then change...
N🆗ri (Marisa): the masquerade is at 6, i might go check it out at 7 if it's still going on
N🆗ri (Marisa): if it's dark
Aldus Larian (Jess): 4 should be ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): the wall between exhibits and main events is a fake wall so if you're standing near it you can hear everything in the other room and it used to kill me to hear everything but not see it
Bill: She wants to bring Meg to her shoot and I guess I can’t refuse since I’m bring Tom and Jess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): meg is also entering so that makes sense. every photoshoot with flora is usually also a photoshoot with meg
N🆗ri (Marisa): meg is so nice, is it bad that she's coming?
Bill: Nah it fine. I just don’t know Star ocean so I’m not really hype for the shoot? And more people is more work?
N🆗ri (Marisa): meg is cosplaying ralsei
N🆗ri (Marisa): from deltarune
Bill: Oh. Maybe she just want to tag along then?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
Bill: Do you know when lineup is for masq?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 5 probably
N🆗ri (Marisa): since that's when they're lining up
N🆗ri (Marisa): seating is at 5:30 and it starts at 6
N🆗ri (Marisa): they usually don't allow people to lineup more than an hour before an event
N🆗ri (Marisa): entrants have to be in the green room by 5 so they can be lined up to walk across the stage
Bill: So ye her estimate be right.
Bill: She fine with four.
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you gonna watch the masquerade
can u send me a play by play
Bill: No?
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): how tf do u change eye color in this app
N🆗ri (Marisa): go to eyes! go to eyecolor!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 360 is the good good
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's funny cuz my character actually needs them
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sharingan
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And I have none
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Give me your under eye circles
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But only when I cosplay known
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao that auto correct
N🆗ri (Marisa): pls take them i beg of u
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): When he's Ray, he is known
Bill: Oh ye Morgan pointed out I have nice eyes at the photo class. Pretty common compliment for the day, but like. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): they call him Mr. Ray
Bill: Gotta make sure to contact up for Zenkai.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lets see what 360 does to that pic
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats prob better
N🆗ri (Marisa): the eyebrow tool helps a lot too
Aldus Larian (Jess): ugh i wanna play around with it but i cant be on my phone
N🆗ri (Marisa): It take me from hideous to almost passable
N🆗ri (Marisa): a true hero app
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait it says i have to pay to save it?
Bill: I don't see the difference, they're both beautiful.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no you can save it in low quality for free, or to save in high quality you can watch a video that works 50% of the time
N🆗ri (Marisa): very different, much change
N🆗ri (Marisa): to save everything in high quality all of the time without watching a video you can pay, but otherwise the free version works fine by watching a video on mute
Aldus Larian (Jess): huh i save it low rez i think
Bill: 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof sakurasans latest picture is so white it hurts my eyes
N🆗ri (Marisa): ouch yeah that's bright
N🆗ri (Marisa): why is the bottom right blurred out
Bill: I use 'blown out' sections for Weiss on occasion, particular in the hair, but that doesn't mean you can blow out her face.
Bill: Also, white balance is hella off.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Define “blown out”
Bill: White pixels.
Bill: i also air quote because they've been artificially brought to stark white, not taken that way. Truly blown out pixels are 100% white and have no color information. Even if you modify them, they'll never have color.
Bill: Black, being all the colors, also doesn't look right so blown out pixels are basically staying the way they are.
Bill: The rule of them is under expose, because a mostly black pixel has color information in it so if you brighten it, you get the color of the object.
Bill: So you usually don't want the highlights of an image being pure white, especially not from camera. It's too bright to mesh with anything else. I've pushed the highlights to that for Weiss at times, cause white hair. I *want* it to pop and look stark contrasted to everything else.
Bill: It's not just the hair in the sakura picture, it's her face that's approaching blow out. Tis why her cheeks are whitish.
Bill: wog arrived.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): samesies
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just 3 more hours to go...
Bill: Mood, except then I have a 2 hour drive home. 😭
Bill: Zenkai hype is real I'm already done for the week.
Bill: Oh yeah, Morgan told me she shoots in waterloo village despite the photo policy they have. They just don't care if it's off season.
Bill: Which would be a good Kuroyuri.
Bill: I mean? Not wrong but?
Andrew: zenkai hype is real and i have an 11 day work period befor eit
Andrew: almost done
Bill: Hurd park is in fucking Dover.
Bill: And it'
Bill: And it come recommended as a place to do *wedding/engagement* photos.
Bill: We need to go.
Bill: It would be great to have a pocket place to do photos nearby.
Bill: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?hl=en&mid=1HVDEpKSmRWukN61k0H4cyFQOPP7u_ynT&ll=40.73153074659352%2C-74.97971740268969&z=9 map smaller now.
Bill: Who wants to do a cute spring set when it's warm enough to be outside in spring clothes.
Bill: *but you need to drive up here for that Mawisa...*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah I can do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve said that before I can go up any time with some notice
Bill: 😮
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~*I see that blue dot in Reading for what I'm assuming is the Pagoda*~~
Bill: YES.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I need a cosplay that would be relevant to shoot there~~
Bill: oops caps.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~but also someone else do shoots there and then visit me~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I would shoot ya Bill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just can’t promise quality ahaaaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's a weird lookin pagoda
Bill: I'd set up the camera for you ahead of time, and run with that.
Bill: You'll be hanging with us so there'll be opportunity.
Bill: Found it odd he suggested it is all.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I assume he’s running with it being like a switch
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’d be ironic that the cosplayer becomes the photographer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which cosplays at what time?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The Pagoda's claim to fame
N🆗ri (Marisa): o snap is that really it?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel so bad for that movie. i met the guy who did choreography he had such huge hopes and was so ecstatic to be part of it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): when they announced they were filming at the Pagoda the city was super excited and then turned out it was apparently only used in the poster?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah, M. Night Shyamalan is from Bucks County, PA and often shoots in fairly local locations
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a strange looking pagoda
N🆗ri (Marisa): orly? i'm so sorry
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was meant to be a hotel
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but they were denied a liquor licence and the project was abandoned *after it had already been built*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then the people who owned it sold it to the City for $1
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah i see it was build before wwii. maybe they didn't have enough references of what a pagoda looks like
N🆗ri (Marisa): what a bargain
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think it's the roof. it's really steep like a house roof.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah it's not a traditional pagoda so it's not sure what part of Asia it's based on
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it has a chimney
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but the bell at the top is Japanese
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): again, meant to be a hotel so that's probably why
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): fireplace in the lobby for a cozy aesthetic
N🆗ri (Marisa): where's the bell
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): very top floor
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> I mean. We have the MM group sunday, big 3 saturday? Pilot boi has limited picture ops without Weiss/Raven, casual mirio is casual.
Bill: Asides from saturday morning you weren't really booked to do things right?
Bill: ironic yes, specifically you I'm like. 🤔
Aldus Larian (Jess): does he know any other friends of yours?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^^^ that’s probably him just jumping to the first person he can think of
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aVJcIUPHWzH8yBHCy2H1Ay_pXSrl8TsEbboA8CTns8I
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Here my schedule, I can try shooting anytime that isn’t blocked off on there

N🆗ri (Marisa): i guess the platypus is me <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: ~~yo you paying bank on saturday apparently why~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rebecca wanted someone to hold the light thing and do cape throws
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She also wasn’t sure she could 100% be comfy with her client alone cause he LORG MAN
Bill: hmm. Never seen her with flashes. Unless reflector.
Bill: ooof.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye so I was like sure
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And ye Saturday I’m at least splitting everything with Rebecca or Erik or Justin
Bill: Can tag along too. 👌
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No solos just how I like it WHEE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye ofc
N🆗ri (Marisa): is there a time anyone would like to play roulette
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): In the night hours prob
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When we chillin
Bill: ~~you could have said somethin, save munes you know~~
Bill: anytime we're together!
Bill: *All* the times we're together.
N🆗ri (Marisa): we were together a lot at katsu tho and never got the time
Bill: all cookies all the time.
Bill: Zenkai isn't Katsu.

Aldus Larian (Jess): i need more clay
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo all the circle stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): shoot
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have belt pieces but they're probably different from yours. everything else is attached to the cape/leotard
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have wristband i ordered but idk if they look good or not
Bill: I’m not having anyone out shoot me of my best friend, so you better bring your spontaneous shoot game <@!245270932602486784>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O I MEAN IF YOURE ASKIN
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was gonna ask about snapping a few of the casual Starfire and raven if you could
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s starfires design so
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _you know how topical that outfit is_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also assuming Jess is down
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~could i request like one or two pictures from someone when i get my break if there's nothing happening. like even just a phone picture pls.~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): will pay
Aldus Larian (Jess): i can snap pics of u maiwsa and yea im down for picolo designs i have the shirt, not sure if ill go with fishnets and shorts, or the pants yet
N🆗ri (Marisa): bless <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Aldus Larian (Jess): dis one!
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH mawisa do u think Ill be able to use one of your jewels? the ones i dofered are super round and i dont think they will stick to my face
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!! i made u one let me get it. if you don't like it lemme konw
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry it's not a proper diamond i couldn't find that
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): its beautiful and i love it
Aldus Larian (Jess): i pay for gem with pics even exchange
N🆗ri (Marisa): the back isn't perfectly flat but if anyone has a nail file it can easy be made flat
N🆗ri (Marisa): bless
N🆗ri (Marisa): hard to see in the pic but it's kind of sparkly <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Who's being blackfire 🙏
Aldus Larian (Jess): you
N🆗ri (Marisa): you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Shit
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I need a black wig and high waisted denim shorts immediately
N🆗ri (Marisa): what a Look
Bill: Whose asking.
Bill: Also I still wanna shoot all day. I just don’t want a schkedule that keeps me from continuing a shoot or enjoying a conversation.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i cosplay from series' you aren't a fan of so i wasn't sure if you would be interested
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👁 🐝 🍁 in 🇺 <@351785752197201920>
N🆗ri (Marisa): maid blake and pokemon maybe are the only ones you like and pokemon is just me with some dolls which must be boring to shoot
N🆗ri (Marisa): erik bee canada in u-turn tom
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I believe in Elfriede faun too
Bill: I mean, I wouldn’t shoot Emma no. I have no unique ideas for her from the source material so it’s kinda blah. Teen titans isn’t really my thing, I’m shooting it cause FRIENDS like you Mawisa. You can’t know what I wanna shoot unless you ask, don’t assume. 

And I meant that mostly for schedule Chan Georgia. Also for you, I said I’m not into big groups anymore but duos/trios/4 man teams are all still my thing. Incase that wasn’t clear. And same thing with the interest. 

I’m trying to be not tied down so I don’t have to cut shoots/conversations short. I’m not getting paid, the next shoot I do isn’t paying me, so I don’t want to be restricted from doing what I AM enjoying to do something I may or may not enjoy more.
Bill: Bleh.
Bill: Fuuuucking converse are still too small my poor feet.
