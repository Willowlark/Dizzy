Bill: hmm...

Bill: ! counter remove marisa-hating-marisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): 2million
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
N🆗ri (Marisa): dizzy stop that
Bill: We're not even going to count those anymore.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm bad at math i can't count it myself someone has to
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a lot in this powerpoint and even more i wanna add but no time for that
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe i shouldn't have started in the year 700
Bill: I thought Anime started with astro boy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw
N🆗ri (Marisa): i left out momotaro but i have a clip from wwii's momotaro's divine sea warriors
N🆗ri (Marisa): the first momotaro is circa 1924 or so
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm almost certain anime started with sailor moon
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think i have one picture of sailor moon somewhere
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:rise:557579163511554050>
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah there she is with 8 other characters
N🆗ri (Marisa): there are a  lot of animations in this that're probably gonna fail. theoretically i click and they all fly up magically isn't that neat.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It should work,
Elfriede Faun (Tom): How does it work you being in a flashdirve?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Anime started with evengelion (I prob didn't even spell that right)
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Evangelion isn't even an anime, it's the Apex of modern storytelling ofc
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh right I'm sorry
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg i've been arguing with myself all day whether to talk about evangelion. it's also only got one picture.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm bringing in a flash drive, i'm putting a backup on my camera's sd card, and i'm sending myself a zipped folder with everything in it
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd upload it to google drive too but no space
N🆗ri (Marisa): there are a lot of big video files that have to stay with the powerpoint
N🆗ri (Marisa): i downloaded them if the internet didn't work
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Don't forget to write out the ones and zeros on paper and recode it when you get there
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also parts to assemble a 💻
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): and i'll video it on my phone ahead of time so there's a video of the slides on my phone
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:rise:557579163511554050> <:rise:557579163511554050> <:rise:557579163511554050> <:rise:557579163511554050> <:rise:557579163511554050> <:rise:557579163511554050> <:rise:557579163511554050>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im trying really hard to get the house clean for you guys
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I keep sitting down
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't have much sailor moon or eva. maybe i can add a bit of sailor moon elsewhere. and inuyasha.
i have plenty of astro boy just because of how people conflagrate tezuka but very little speed racer. i should put that in. i have betty boop and a few Fleischer cartoons but i left out fantasmagorie.
N🆗ri (Marisa): sit
N🆗ri (Marisa): sit ur legs
Aldus Larian (Jess): It troll u
N🆗ri (Marisa): Shikigami <:pew:543202259085950996>

Bill: I don't get it.
Bill: There are far cuter pictures of you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Now you just gonna get the ass and thighs in there and you win insta
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh I think they are the Mana currency in sekiro
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They are called charms tho

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i thought the pyrrha one would be unflattering but i like it
N🆗ri (Marisa): after considerable consideration i've decided that infinity war spoilers are okay in my panel
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The first or the sequel
Bill: Probably the first. Georgia likes pictures that show off da thigh armor.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just concentrate really hard and force facial hair to sprout from your face
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s how it works
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh, kurtis has that dust crystal that someone gave me at katsu! you could borrow that for hazel drug authenticity xD
Bill: Was considering making a trip to FYE later to get me some of the rock candy.
Bill: For memeing.
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I actually modeled a dust crystal for Ethan but I don't think I'd be able to print it in time lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sorry Dizzy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What words trigger dizzy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ethan

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ```for Ethan```
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dizzy: <:triggered_cinder:389869499597455390>

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Dizzy, headpat <@392695089547444256>
Bill: so... will someone bring that? I guess do it at con?
Bill: I don't assume with this stuff cause I could theoretically be doing it myself but...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That guy that was talking to me at Zenkai, with the baby
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Who did he hate on for doing boudoir?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): empty_deity
Bill: when that happen.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wait, no... wrong account
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not empty_deity
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I forget
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they've since deleted their boudoir bashing posts
Bill: Boudoir great.
Bill: Just a fucking meme of a time.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Did not expect that to be as much fun as it was.
Bill: (I was worried I'd be overthinking it, not anything about you Tom/Jess)
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O I hope that guy turned out to not be hateful then cause “you have very recognizable bone structure” was a very nice compliment
Bill: still what?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That guy? Who was hating on the boudoir? I hope by deleting his posts about it he learned not to be a jerk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause jerks shouldn’t give nice compliments
Bill: he complimented you then complained about boudoir?
Bill: I wasn't with you when this happened apparently.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No he complained about boudoir online
Bill: oooh.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And then saw me at Zenkai and complimented me
Bill: weird flex but okay.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh wow chocowaffos dad is an FX costumer
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok i'm cutting off the powerpoint at 42 slides
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think that's enough
Bill: That’s amazing wow.

N🆗ri (Marisa): there is. a lot.
and i'm leaving out a ton of stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the design recommendations stopped working again so some slides are really nice and others are "graphic design is my passion" level <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): nice!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm going to talk really fast for an hour
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hals tryna go to dragoncon lol wut
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): where tf is that
Bill: Strange for a con goer to go to a con.
Bill: Also so.
Bill: I uh.
Bill: Did buy two tickets to Zenkai.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im gonna brace myself for the joke but its in georgia
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh geez
Bill: That’d be a pretty tasteless joke...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): except he aint got no one to go with cause the only people i know that go are party squad, and he probably doesnt talk to them as much post-meg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean its kinda funny
Bill: Would be if you didn’t have a strong aversion to him.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mmmm no its still funny
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Hal lands 
> posts to Instagram story
> *Georgia, I'm in you*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): This year’s zenkai or next year’s?
Bill: Last year.
Bill: Err. This year.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Big Oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dragoncon is really neat. There are military cosplayers that bought the same carpet used in the hotel floor and camouflaged into the hotel ground.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Goals
Bill: Ye I’ve seen some cool stuff come from there.
N🆗ri (Marisa): And then the venue literally tried to sue them
Bill: Lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WHAT
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO??? sUE THEM?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): for what
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats amazing
N🆗ri (Marisa): Copyright infringement of the carpet pattern or something like that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmfaooooooooooooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): Carpet design is their passion
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah an article here says they printed the carpet pattern using spoonflower and then their costumes went viral and the company who made the carpet got real upset about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO??????????????????????
Bill: Isn’t it in Atlanta?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "they carpeted their bodies without our permission"
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooo they made the custom fabric available on spoonflower for others to also make hotel carpet camo costumes
N🆗ri (Marisa): No one can be a carpet it’s illegal everyone go home
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn there goes that dream
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye dragoncon is a big boi
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They have a cosplay parade and everything
Bill: Ron is moving down there, and Ronnie/Jess already do live there...
Bill: Hmm.
Bill: I wonder how close they are.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why tf is hal tryna go all the way down there except to follow party crew
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wow jess I didn’t know you lived so far away
Bill: Cause iirc he went last year?
Aldus Larian (Jess): right
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No?
Bill: Where did he do thotty Denki with Meg and them doing bunny girl BNHA?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anime USA I think
Bill: Maybe I'm wrong.
Bill: The southern cons all blur together to me.
Bill: ~~except Holmat~~
Bill: ~~lets go to the fucking beach in December fam~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): AnimeUSA and Dragoncon’s venue look really similar. The people at AnimeUSA are real weird though. Lots of mean people hitting their kids and being impolite last I went
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There’s a lot of partying at dragoncon I recall I think that’s where the party wizards were born
Bill: lol there's a lot of partying at every big con.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But the birth of the _party wizards_
Bill: truuuu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Some cons party more than others
Bill: Unless your Ryan and get invited to multiple orgys.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeaaah that’s true
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They should have a database for cons like they do colleges
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): With ratings on partying and cosplaying and the like
Bill: I started to put together a con cheat sheet but gave up years ago.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....he got invited to orgys?
Bill: *multiple*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cosplay orgys
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: Ryan is a god.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): did ...did he go?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which entertained the conversation, do they have someone at the door to check that everyone’s in cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lol no
Bill: *That* I don't know.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Otakon he didn’t
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He raved with dan and Tristan
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And dan and Ryan blew Tristan’s lemons at the rave
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s supposed to say mind
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m gonna leave it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): is that what the kids are calling it these days
Bill: ` The cocktail program, overseen by beverage director Jim Kearns, features takes on classic cocktails, like a gin martini dressed up with lavender herb vermouth, honey, lemon, and sparkling wine.` Jess?
Aldus Larian (Jess): wheremst?
Bill: So... Gord just forwarded me an email with the event calendar at a bar that on the same block as our office.
Bill: hotel / nightclub.
Bill: I'm still googling the place...
Bill: But I think it's a 1980's themed club.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo neato
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!334090409389195266>  cant go cuz she "knOwS NoThinG AbOuT ThE 80s"

N🆗ri (Marisa): nice question asking
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH speaking of dragoncon i have this in my panel
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): What did Miami Mike do?
N🆗ri (Marisa): something unspeakable
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok so apparently last year people were desperate to solve the age old mystery of what miami mike did and people started to track him down
N🆗ri (Marisa): "Miami Mike and Ctenosaur were both at a con, Ctenosaur traded some video tapes of anime they'd fansubed to Miami Mike in exchange for some merchandise (model kits, figures, wall scrolls) he was selling at the Con. Then, at a later con, Ctenosaur was probably outraged to find Miami Mike was selling copies of the fansubs he'd traded Ctenosaur for (in addition to the fansubs that he'd already been selling at previous cons)."
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): miami mike ran a shop called Anime Hurricane and people tracked him down by an old business card
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol this powerpoint is 591 mb
N🆗ri (Marisa): not including the videos
N🆗ri (Marisa): if powerpoints were physical entities and you threw it at someone that could really mess them up
Bill: pish.
Bill: try some of my raw files.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ray is too strong and I have surrounded him with protective measures. Nothing with that much storage space should ever exist
Bill: Are you properly backing up your photos?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~that sentence makes me feel very conflicted~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have backed up some photos yes
Bill: Good.
Bill: What. Should I wear to Sakura Sunday.
Bill: I don’t really do spring colors...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do spring colors anyway
Bill: I mean. I don’t HAVE spring colors.
Bill: Lol
Bill: As we learned from last weekend, I’m neither preppy or emo I’m just neutral.
Bill: What’s. Spring like outside of Easter blue and pink.
Aldus Larian (Jess): All pastels
Bill: I’m going to the mall... 👀
Bill: Pinterest did not give me anything useful.

Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
