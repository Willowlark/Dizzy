NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'm bad at math i can't count it myself someone has to
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): there's a lot in this powerpoint and even more i wanna add but no time for that
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): maybe i shouldn't have started in the year 700
Bill: I thought Anime started with astro boy.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): naw
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i left out momotaro but i have a clip from wwii's momotaro's divine sea warriors
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): the first momotaro is circa 1924 or so
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm almost certain anime started with sailor moon
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i think i have one picture of sailor moon somewhere
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:rise:557579163511554050>
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah there she is with 8 other characters
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): there are a  lot of animations in this that're probably gonna fail. theoretically i click and they all fly up magically isn't that neat.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It should work,
Elfriede Faun (Tom): How does it work you being in a flashdirve?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Anime started with evengelion (I prob didn't even spell that right)
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Evangelion isn't even an anime, it's the Apex of modern storytelling ofc
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh right I'm sorry
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): omg i've been arguing with myself all day whether to talk about evangelion. it's also only got one picture.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'm bringing in a flash drive, i'm putting a backup on my camera's sd card, and i'm sending myself a zipped folder with everything in it
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'd upload it to google drive too but no space
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): there are a lot of big video files that have to stay with the powerpoint
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i downloaded them if the internet didn't work
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Don't forget to write out the ones and zeros on paper and recode it when you get there
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also parts to assemble a ğŸ’»
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): YEAH

Aldus Larian (Jess): Im trying really hard to get the house clean for you guys
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I keep sitting down
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i don't have much sailor moon or eva. maybe i can add a bit of sailor moon elsewhere. and inuyasha.
i have plenty of astro boy just because of how people conflagrate tezuka but very little speed racer. i should put that in. i have betty boop and a few Fleischer cartoons but i left out fantasmagorie.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): sit
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): sit ur legs
