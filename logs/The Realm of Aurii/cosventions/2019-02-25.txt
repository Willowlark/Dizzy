Bill: It proves. Difficult. To find a trenchcoat in non asian sizings.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): are you bein spooderman
Bill: Was talking about V.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think my ex had a trenchcoat like that...
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i thought V was more a suit jacket dude
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): in another story he wears a beige trenchcoat
Bill: Apparently not, according to the one full image of the outfit.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oooooo kewl
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~cuz hes like living in the woods or someshit~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah i hear trenchcoat and just think hobo spiderman
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): o wow
Bill: while I associate with the failure that is Peter B Parker, I'm not interested in bodysuits or the hype wave.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): peter b parker isnt a failure
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes a badass hobo man
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~after the failure i guess oops~~
Bill: Did you miss his opening.
Bill: Ye that.
Bill: I'm the one whose crying in bathtub eating pizza with half a shoe on.
Bill: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LOL WUT
Bill: He's great I love him.
Bill: He cared more about the pizza than getting sucked in a wormhole.
Bill: Apparently only Asians wear beige trench coats.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): must be instyle there XD
Bill: ~~not that I can wear anything Asian~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): rip da dream 😭
Bill: I imagine you'd consider a suit jacket too out of character.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he wheres a cardigan in main story
Bill: ~~so yes~~
Bill: That's findable. I have that design in black.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not a suit jacket tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he wears suit jacket sometimes too just not a main outfit
Bill: tbh from what I can tell any dress clothes fit him.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What wig? V wig? That's just Tom's poppy wog with no pigtails
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's technically not the right color
Bill: uu...
Bill: It may come down to 'can I find something applicable wandering rockaway'.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Vs hair is longer in another story than main story
Bill: well another story is shot. literally cannot find trenchcoat.

Bill: I'm less motivated to make a special trip to things, even if I knew where to go.
Bill: oh squid, good point, aquarium.
Bill: or zoo.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s also the only thing that showed up when I searched for squirrel <:pew:543202259085950996> squi

N🆗ri (Marisa): Aquariums can be hard for photography because ~ambient lighting~ and all the glass but zoos are good
Bill: I've shoot at one before. It's a trip but why not.
Bill: Non cosplay trip to NYC leggo!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~nyc is the biggest zoo of all~~
Bill: true though.
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> what kind of things did you want to do on that plan for a day in NYC?
Bill: Weather should be amiable for it soon.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): uhhhh idk museums? Broadway would be neat... uhh shopping?
Bill: what kind of shopping? I only really do speciality shopping in NYC, cause carrying general shit around the city would suck.
Bill: So I only go to like, weeb stores and the swiss army knife shop.
Bill: That's not to say I'm against anything, just what I've done before.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): dunno haven't really thought about it. Ash says k-town is coo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont have a "normal" for NYC
Bill: well the whole point is do special anyway. 😃 My normal is slog in on the subway and leave as soon as possible.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive always wated to do ellis island too but i feel like thats it own day
Bill: Is it?
