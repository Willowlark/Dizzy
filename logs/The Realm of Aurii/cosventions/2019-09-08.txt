Aldus Larian (Jess): What's depressing :9
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): The food alone?
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Omelette time
Nokri (Marisa): o what's so depressing about eating alone?
Bill: The way it happened. Telling the hostess to take the reservation from 5 to 1. Bailed after that.
Nokri (Marisa): you left the restaurant?? :0
Nokri (Marisa): the only one who cared was probably the waitress, because she'd only get 1 tip instead of 5
Bill: I donâ€™t want to discuss it, itâ€™s fine.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Hope the Ren faire was good at least ðŸ‘Œ
Bill: It was.

Bill: Heâ€™s working.
Nokri (Marisa): wow can't believe he discorded while at work smh
Bill: Heâ€™ll answer you when he can.
Nokri (Marisa): he's not available 24/7 to cater to every whim? every beck and call? every possible scenario that could occur in which his input would be helpful? unacceptable. unfathomable. ridiculous.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah! No blades!
Nokri (Marisa): 
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): HIM
Bill: Well yes, but also no
Nokri (Marisa): O he was at rwby konkon
Do people not like him anymore?
Bill: Nah, heâ€™s fine in my book. Heâ€™s just a party person so us borderline and hardcore introverts donâ€™t usually cross his groupâ€™s path.
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thank
Bill: Like I say hello and most of the time they respond, but we donâ€™t. Talk or anything.
Bill: Kirsten (kiradesa) thinks I should join the ANYC shugo chara group and they *somehow* donâ€™t have best boi Ikuto.
Nokri (Marisa): you should start one of those diaries where you leave it in a tree and swSHUGO CHARA GRUOP
Nokri (Marisa): JOIN
Nokri (Marisa): best boi is obviously plagg

Bill: Not buying a Ikuto casual outfit, would need a black button up with blue trim. Iâ€™d expect Iâ€™d have to alter that and thatâ€™s not exciting.
Bill: Oh shit he is Plagg.
Nokri (Marisa): this is cool
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Good eve woa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Can someone take pics of my swimsuit 2B at CCE? Prob on Friday sometime?

Kaio Vermino (Lee): Theres a photoshoot meetup and a 21+ panel
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Photoshoot is at 7pm
Andrew: Is that swimsuit and/or genderbend or any?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Any
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Pretty sure at least
Kaio Vermino (Lee): They both have events on Facebook
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah pretty sure it's just a general meetup
Bill: Well 7 certainly wonâ€™t conflict with us doing any shoots. Sounds good.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Question: do we have refrigerator?
Aldus Larian (Jess): We should

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok!
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I think we brought that stuff last year
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I remember Justin and Rayna bringing oj
Bill: I brought stuff to make strawberry sunrises.
Bill: They brought the orange juice.
Bill: We never had them.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Right!
Nokri (Marisa): Because a strawberry sunrise sounds like alcohol, thatâ€™s why no one had it. Alcohol illegal
Nokri (Marisa): O dang the ren faire is expensive
Why so many people going recently?
Nokri (Marisa): Save $30 by boiling some grass in a pot over a fire on your front lawn while singing about the plague
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's only goes on during this time of year
Nokri (Marisa): Really?? :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea the NY one at least it's from end of August until like mid October?

Bill: Because itâ€™s fun.
Bill: <@!334090409389195266> I booked a massage at noon thursday of the con, I didn't know when you were coming and needed to book it. So I'd avoid getting there between  11:45 and 1:15 lest you wander the con with your bags again.
Bill: Everyone else isn't coming down till 3.
Bill: afaik.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yee I'll come after 1 then o3o
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Thanks for the heads up! :D
