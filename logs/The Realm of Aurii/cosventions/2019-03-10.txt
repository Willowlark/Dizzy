N🆗ri (Marisa): is this happening for anyone else when looking at the neir photos? 😱
Bill: no.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i try again at a later time
Bill: might be a cache thing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): you'll never cache me alive
Bill: I could tell you how to clear it but.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@245270932602486784>  which photo are you posting Monday?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~cuz I was gonna post the one one of me and you but it if wanna post it I'll post a different one~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You can post the same oneeeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): On the same day? :/
Bill: Why not.
N🆗ri (Marisa): mirror the image
Aldus Larian (Jess): Eh?? People don't wanna see the same post twice in a row and most of my followers are also Georgias
Bill: worry about it monday <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): and then panic at the last moment <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): zenkaikon room assignments were finally posted and I think BoJo and I got our own double room??? that would be so sweet. really bizarre but awesome.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's no one else listed for our room number
Bill: nice!
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah and it's really strange. that never happens. all rooms are usually filled at all times, and there's even a couple rooms with 5 people listed. i heard bojo had a problem with her room last year though and really complained about it to management so maybe they remembered.
N🆗ri (Marisa): come party
Bill: staffing sounds terrible.
Aldus Larian (Jess): That would be awesome if you guys got your own room!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye we could throw a party
Aldus Larian (Jess): Will you invite me?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok but you can't forget your invite and you have to arrive via carriage
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you forget a carriage you can borrow one from the amish
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok o will attempt
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo <@301927856240459777>  I was showing my mom pic from katsu  said you are cute and also that your make makeup for Ray was very convincing

N🆗ri (Marisa): tell her thank and that i swear my fealty
Aldus Larian (Jess): She said u cute so it must be true
Bill: Jess's mom never lies.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i want to dunk my face in a container of whipped cream
N🆗ri (Marisa): ask her the secrets of the universe
Bill: Whipped cream is yummy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): cream made with actual whips
Bill: is that your kink?
N🆗ri (Marisa): no i just think it's neat
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa doesn't have kinks
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes there's a kink in my back when i sleep on it funny
N🆗ri (Marisa): i swear this trunchbull cosplayer is wyrd but i can't ever remember her doing this costume

Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHH omg
Aldus Larian (Jess): Das my fav movie ever

N🆗ri (Marisa): she looks identical to wyrd though i'm freakin out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooooo Which one did you wanna post Jess
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll post one version and you post the other
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m fine with eithe r
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): r
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo that's a good idea! I'd prob wanna do the one with my eyes forward? Just cuz the blue is really prelevent
Aldus Larian (Jess): For me I mean
Aldus Larian (Jess): If das ok
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dat one? ~~I fixed my shoulder strap in dis one that’s all lmao~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okie I’ll post this one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye! I'll post the open eye one
N🆗ri (Marisa): the woke version
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeee GOOD PLAN
Aldus Larian (Jess): Coo ♥️
N🆗ri (Marisa): There something wrong with my computer screen <:thinku:543194478614413318> it keeps getting bright and blue and making pictures bad so if you guys want a refund I provide full picture refund
I got Scott’s pictures to him. I think he hates them. He didn’t really say anything about them or say thanks <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: hmm. Does you computer have a night shift?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh yeah I used to keep it on a lot. That makes it redder and darker <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Fuck 'em. If he's not appreciative just forget about him. Did that with that chameleon chick last year at Katsu.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Night light’s not on even if i support the ship <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): i turned it on owo
Bill: That should redden your screen colors.
Bill: https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-calibrate-your-monitor/
Bill: You can look at this to calibrate via software.
N🆗ri (Marisa): woah a guide
thank
i'll try not to mess up on step one and accidentally bring about the resurgence of the ottoman empire
Bill: if you do it okay, Otto was my favorite rocket power kid.
N🆗ri (Marisa): [raises gamma to max because it sounds cool]
N🆗ri (Marisa): **the calibration wizard**
Bill: Oh, turn off night shift before doing it.
Bill: If it didn't do it automatically.
N🆗ri (Marisa): aww ok
Bill: You can turn night shift back on, but the goal is to get the regular tint of the monitor accurate.
Bill: Night shift reduces the blue tint of your normal color calibration.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it's just odd because when i turn the computer on it starts off at a normal color and then a minute or two later it'll go "waIT A MINUTE" and spaz out and then the screen gets lighter and a little bluer
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it's like "yeah much better this is how stuff looks" and i go "where's the other screen"
N🆗ri (Marisa): *i can flip the screen omg*
Bill: That's weird. Some kind of software setting is doing htat.
Bill: Maybe one of your webcam filter things.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o they all should be turned off
i'll check all the not-virus programs i downloaded on a whim and get rid of them since i never used them
Bill: how'd color calibration work?
N🆗ri (Marisa): little better! 👌
Bill: good!
Bill: I could talk you through using safe mode to figure out if there's software that's modifying the colors.
Bill: Bit more complicated.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that sounds scary and intimidating and i appreciate the offer but i may wind up deleting system32
Bill: You have windows 10?
N🆗ri (Marisa): hhmmmmmmmmaybe i think yes?
Bill: windows 10 does have a soft reset of the OS, if you're really desperate. I'd try other solutions first.
N🆗ri (Marisa): soft reset. gentle do-over.
Bill: It's effectively reinstalling the  whole computer.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i backup nothing
Bill: BACKUP
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't sylvia is sitting behind me
Bill: But also do other things first.
N🆗ri (Marisa): forward march
N🆗ri (Marisa): learn to play the marimba
N🆗ri (Marisa): good advice biru there's so much to do
Bill: Other things to fix your screen silly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o
duct tape
Bill: There's a really good photo in the Zeikani/Georgia set but this dude is really obviously in the background and I actually want to try and remove him.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ask him nicely but firmly to please leave
Bill: he's too big to use heal or clone in lightroom, too details to desaturate and blend in...
Bill: =/
N🆗ri (Marisa): cover him up with another object like a tree
N🆗ri (Marisa): photoshop yourself t-posing over the guy
Bill: 
Bill: There's notthing to stick over him.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooooooooooooo oof yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): pls consider
Bill: OwO
Bill: you cleared the background so well!
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's His power the power of T pose
N🆗ri (Marisa): he had to do it to 'em
N🆗ri (Marisa): try the spot healing tool over all of the dude and then it's gonna be a grey blurry mess you can touch up with clone tool
Bill: This is all I got 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): LIKE THAT
Bill: but it looks like shit on mine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no it looks divine that's the light of photography heaven
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It works
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If you didn't know the guy was there in the first place you wouldn't be able to tell
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But also, Marisa's is pretty good too
Bill: Marisa's is AMAZING
Bill: ended up with this. Zeikani can edit it more if needed.

Bill: Um, YES
Bill: I mean. He didn't. BUT YES NIER MOOD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WHY DID HE NOT TELL ME THIS LIKE MONTHS AGO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WTF
Bill: It was cold months ago but *it won't be soon*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They have events there so we would have to go on an off day
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's open to the public, so we wouldnt need permission.
Bill: That's the info I was trying to find.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's pretty sweet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He said on off days theres only like 10 people
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So like pretty dead
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And that even the streets and stuff look dilapidated to go with the "theme"
Bill: can we actually get near the factory stuff?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea he has hundreds of photos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Just like inside
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He went back in October or something
Bill: FUCK YES
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Lools pretty legit
Bill: Absolutely.
Bill: When's the only question.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> there an insta for Justin's friend Tom?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nooope
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AND WHOA THAT PLACE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bill you’re really cruising through photos what a productive day you must be havin
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You’re like that scene in death note where he’s writing in the book and having an epic montage
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Except with photos
Bill: I've got nothing else to do.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): *the death note scene*

"I'll take this potato chip AND EDIT IT" * dramatic music plays *
Bill: May be productive but this is a boring weekend.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m trying to Marie Kondo my cosplay storage but it’s very difficult oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My room too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like my dorm, obviously I have no space so I use everything that’s there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But my room at home? I feel like there’s so much junk I don’t use
Bill: You also don't live at home.
Bill: For the record, I hate the coloring in quite a few Pyrrha Penny. It weird.
Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/gallery/2019/03/10/orange-sherbet-safe-house.html <@!334090409389195266> <@!350855105123319808>  They're barely edited cause jpgs and effort but some fun ones.
Bill: Pyrrha and Ray shoot are all that's left. Ray shoot will require E for Effort with all the different lighting scenarios we did, and not in the mood for Pyrrha's so those will wait.
Bill: cept now I'm bored.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hey biru, do you happen to have more zoomed out versions of the photos with 2B and the sword?
Bill: No... they aren’t cropped.
Bill: I didn’t get enough space.
Aldus Larian (Jess): okey dokey
