Bill: Haha. I got just enough people on the shoots lotto to give em all shoots. There isnâ€™t even a conflict.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Daayyummluckey them
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Monica, Mak, and who?
Bill: Audrey.
Bill: Is it really lucky though?
Bill: I bought a ticket to kotori so weee
Bill: Dunno how I feel about BNE cosplay sleepover... I feel like Hunter has full claim to it and I'll just be there awkwardly.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Nonsense
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Everyone is equally as welcome and important
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Iâ€™ll probably do it so people can take pics Saturday, chill Saturday night, and get cosplay work done Sunday
Bill: well, I'm going to Kotori anyway so...
Bill: Guess I'll miss round two.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Is it that weekend?
Bill: That's what Georgia was planning on.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ahh that's why you asked
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Makes sense
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I was thinking about Kotori and I donâ€™t think I care too much for it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Itâ€™d be like another thy Geekdom
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Where I donâ€™t really care for the con and id be going solely for friends
Bill: Kotori is *not* Geekdom. Never saw creeps at Kotori.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The programming is just as limited tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): There were creeps, there are always creeps in all cons  ðŸ‘€
Bill: Anyway I want to see my Rowan friends, catch up, maybe Jen and Jeremy will swing over who knows.
Bill: Kotori is a great chance to do that.
Bill: You never go to programming anyway. Check the shoot schedule, run something for whatever you cosplay.
Bill: * if you were to go.
Bill: Or do the thing at home.
Bill: Maybe it'll be better anyway, since I won't be around while Hunter's shooting.
Bill: I dunno why Hunter makes me so insecure...
Bill: *fitting Dishwasher. Fitting*
Bill: I think I'm a better shot than him... and I *should* have the stronger bonds and trust with peeps, so I should just shoot him out, fancy light gear and his always around better schedule be damned. idk
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): You can both be good photographers tho.
Bill: I mean it in that I shouldnâ€™t be insecure.
Bill: I donâ€™t know if that why but.
