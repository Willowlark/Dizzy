To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I want to shoot so much Pyrrha with people but doing the math I only probably have room for 4 Pyrrha shoots MAX before I change to Ochako 😭
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Do it Japan style where you have a circle of people and photogs around you!! Then when you’re ready to change location move the whole possé
Bill: What, different photogs?
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I wanna shoot Penny/Pyrrha with Leanna
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Team JNPR with tom and Jess
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): This nice Nora @kiko.cos wanted to shoot a team JNPR with me and I was like sure because I’m a ho for new friends
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): And JPaden suggested doing an Arkos shoot if I could locate a Jaune because he had a lot of ideas and I’m a ho for Arkos as well
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): photog prices have really risen a lot in the last couple years
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yeah i used to book photogs for like 30 a person and 80 seemed like a lot
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): now 50 seems the normal and 120 seems like a lot
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): how is the photog market right now
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah!!!! $30-40 used to net you like 8+ pictures and now it's so much more.
I'm currently browsing around, it's all over the place but there are a lot more $100+ for 6~6 images, and most are around $50 or 60 yeah
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): a bunch don't even post their prices they just go "contact me for info" which i hate
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): There was one I saw that was $20 for 15 mins and 10 edits
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): vampiria right? I'm considering them if they still have openings, but i'm really on the fence about their style (that sounds horrible sorry ;u; )
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): i looked at that vampiria persons page
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): i like their style
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): im gonna book hunter for a solo shoot on saturday i think, but idk for A2 or Fallout
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): OH jake responded, he says he doesnt know if hes wearing fallout yet
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): for the value it's great and they do have a ton of awesome shots. i like their saturation and they really nailed some characters perfectly. the photos all give out the same feel though if that makes sense and the backgrounds are distracting.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nah that's ok, I thought there stuff was decent
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): its probably cause the blur background but i tend to like that
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): the person who normally hosts the katsu fallout shoot posted that they only "might" be coming for 2019
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): do... do i yoink it
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): might be the limited backgrounds. their animazement pictures are great and fit the characters but the otakon and especially nekocon look like they're all taken in the same spots
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): maybe i just fear being ripped off again ; u ;
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): omg what do they mean might
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): tell them if they don't go you're gonna yoink it
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): that happened at otakon a few years back. the organizers never showed up so i was like "well. here i go."
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): 
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): should i also open up photoshoots or should i give up on that
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): to be photographer? 😄
Bill: You can if you want to Marisa!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah i've done it for a few years but i suck
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): do ittt
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's more a side thing
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i just gotta........ gotta keep saturatin
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): open lmited slots so you look hella exclusive
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): $500 for 3 pics
each pic is painstaking made into a sbahj comic
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): "i only shoot between 3:01 and 3:07 am on the night of a full moon, no excuses, full deposit before shoot."
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): you have to give me the password when we shoot. i'm not going to tell you the password you should know it in your heart and if you get it wrong you don't get your deposit back
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the contract to shoot with me is 931 pages long you have to read it all
Bill: As far as Pyrrha, I’m into Pyrrha penny and NPR as far as that goes.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): neil patrick rharris

To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): _hand them to me_
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): brb typing up formal ad

Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Where was the shoot?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): otakon! at the hotel we were staying at. innnnn baltimore yeah. I can't remember the name but it's the one that was attached via the under construction walkway that would take you to the outdoor fountains
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I like the ryoko
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): With the sun flair
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~imma slut for some sun flares~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i dunno how to rasterize text in this program
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): well you! are in luck! because i LOVE to abuse unnecessary sun flares
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'll put them in your eyes for dramatic effect
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): praise the ~~sun~~ jess' eyes
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i had to do a lot of editing for that shoot because the costumes were falling apart so if your costume is falling apart never fear
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if i post klk photos do they go in nsfw
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): nah
Bill: The mouth is a cat lol
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): **Has 3 sunflares**
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oof these are from 2015. so ancient.
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Also that Ad is legendary
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): how ar yu so amazin
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): anyway if you ignore the horrible fake blur (i've gotten much better at that <:lenny:395307171539189760>)
i had to photoshop out a water bottle and bags on the ground and rebuild her shoes because when she stood still it worked but the boot covers weren't connected to the heels so every time she moved they got misaligned and the red strap would hang on the ground and we were too lazy to keep fixing it SO photoshop is no extra fee 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/f65jk7hlkeg2nfv/DSCF5891%20copy.jpg?dl=0
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): there are some pixels slightly out of place where the water bottle used to be on the left
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): THE MOUTH **IS** A CAT WOAH
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): what do YOU like to shoot marisa?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i was the only hunter in my 6th grade class when we were assigned to be a hunter-gatherer tribe because i was able to hit a fake dear in the face with a bean bag
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i like anything i guess. i've done spooky scary shots and kawaii uguu stuff. as long as I'm familiar with the source it's nice but that's usually not an issue
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if you have a dress though or anything flowy you're gonna have to spin i'm sorry it's the law
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i like bringing random props too. if people tell me they're doing a school related shoot i always bring big manga it worked really well for a nozaki shoot
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i did a noragami shoot at the last katsu i went to i forget how that went
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): check out this boudoir shot
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hawt
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Good Photoshop fren
Bill: I tested the sunpack flash.... it’s pretty good, maybe not quite as bright but it’ll do if I were to try shooting inside.
Bill: Just need lots of D batteries.
Bill: Which I want to try doing, cause different and learning.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ~~[joke about biru needing the D]~~

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): for a con that's scary
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Damnnn
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Bill wyd
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I really don’t think one photoshoot could be worth 225 but damn...
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I thought rates for those photos would be 80 at best

Bill: Wyd?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oh wait georgia found the number of pics already
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): biru start charging $600
Bill: You all realize that you’d be the only ones expected to pay that right.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): omg i found a girl who looks identical to rebecca
Bill: I barely shoot outside of Aurii, and that’s usually with BNE.
Bill: ~~because shooting with friends is more fun~~
Bill: ~~even if I need to start branching out so I can meet new *women* people~~
Bill: ~~groan~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): does this girl not look identical to her
Bill: She DOES wow.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): RIGHT
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): in like every picture
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): O neat biru is that Dan as Sun in your picture
Bill: Yeah.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): He messaged me out of the blue this week I think he’s goin through some rough times but it’s good to see he’s still going to cons
Bill: Man, every south jersey cosplayer seems to know each other.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): there’s only like three of us
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): in existence
Bill: Nah, I just saw Finn knows Zeikani.
Bill: Finn is everywhere man.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Finninyan
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): REBECCA CLONE
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): DON'T THEY LOOK THE SAME?
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): YEAH AHHH
Bill: is it bad out of all the reasons I had for not posting in the last month, the one that stands out the most is caption writing?
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> am I penciling in Penny/Pyrrha and NPR at Katsu?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sometimes im so stumped for a caption i dont even post
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): are we supposed to come up with captions
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): these arn't bad prices: https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/46313359_2159786034242446_1117303358000988160_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.xx&oh=4cc3efbde7b3887ffcf34e13b42df0af&oe=5C666B5B
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah i was midway through filling out an application for her lol
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i just don't know what to wear
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lmao nice
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): have u shot with her before?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): nop
Bill: Mawisa I gotta put Katarina and Corn on my list, when you wearing them again?
Bill: I have Raymageddon.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Katarina is definitely Friday night now, I'm gonna change into her at 3 then I'm meeting someone at 4 and headed to hall at 5 so anytime after judging

Corrin is Saturday morn/afternoon, haven't decided anything else for Saturday yet but considering Jade for the ball if I can find her dress in my closet
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I might book a Maki shoot with that illoria and if I bring wedding maki that could totally be non-lingerie boudoir
Bill: oh you were the one talking about boudoir semi seriously.
Bill: That's right.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OwO
Bill: ~~Sunset is at 5:40 in Feburary and I don't want to shoot you past sundown *again*~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): you don't shoot indoors?
Bill: I do. Katsu is naturally lit by the glass wall.
Bill: The reason Katsu is so great is it has constant light from outside.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oh yeah i forget it gets dark around the gazebo towards night. hm.
Bill: ~~I do not fight for the Gazebo~~
Bill: You will have to lead the charge on that one.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): give me a few minutes and i can check what areas are well lit at night
the hallway near main events maybe?
Bill: When are you expecting to do this shoot Mawisa.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): katarina?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): whenever you have time
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i could change into her sooner?
Bill: You were saying you can't do 3 to 5?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'll be changing at 3, i could change sooner. I'll be free from 4:30 to 5, I was gonna get in the judging line before it opens to save time later at night but I don't mind waiting in line for a long while if you want to shoot at 4:30
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do people just like book up all thir time with photoshoots at katsu?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): a bunch do ya
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): both cosplayers and photogs
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i do a mix of that and panels
Bill: Georgia and Marisa treat Katsu as a 'working' con.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): get that bread
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont like to work i do that enough
Bill: I did last year and got burned, my usual working con is Next.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): last year i was almost bored at katsu 😓
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): somehow i still didnt get to shop till sunday though? it was weird
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): how are you bored at katsu omg
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ok i can look up spots now
what about that hallway where the spa is? is that dark at night?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i didnt know what there was to do really, no one went to any panels i kinda just wandering with tom until we found friends again, we didnt have many cosplays then either
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if u ever bored come sit with me in the judging line. bring a costume you can get judged too
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): there's a time limit of 10 minutes per person i think so 6 people in line = about an hour of waiting so it'll be long
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😱
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i havent made any sotume fully though i am bad coaply lady
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): noragami tho!!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): and nora!!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): nora noragami
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i reused the nap thingy from a premade one tho D:
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and nore i only made her jacket from scratch
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): u made it!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ill come in just the jacket
Dizzy: http://i.imgur.com/lZHU1hr.jpg
Bill: !lewd
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): that was a fast lewd
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): biru lemme know what you wanna do for katarina and if you seriously want to do maki in the morning
~~boudoir shoot while everyone is getting ready to leave~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): pretty sure the mirror hallway is decently lit at night maybe
Bill: Boudoir stuff is up to you.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH MAWISA if you get home and need to con cronch before katsu, and need more room to work you can come cronch at our house
Bill: *careful, she might *actually* move into your cosplay room*.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): can do boudoir i'm ace so i don't care, and the costume isn't the lewdest costume i've done
CRUNCH PARTY CRUNCH PARTY
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): CRUNCH PARTY
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): LETS GO
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): WE CAN EAT CRUNCHY FOOD
Bill: I... don't think that's an affirmation Marisa.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well marisa needs more room to work
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): is a confirmation if you want to. if not then is cool like a cucumber
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have lots of tables
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): TABLES???
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): dang we don't even have a table
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if i help out at sam's fabrics i can sew there but i'm on the fence about sewing cosplay in a store because i constantly have to try it on
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): but it'd be nice to be right in the fabric store
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): this is the costume in question for potential boudoir
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i have kitchen table and plastic folding table and then 2 tables on the porch and another in the basement and a coffee table
Bill: 🙄 I'm touchy about boudoir, be straight with me. As for Katarina, I would prefer some before sunset. The only time I can't do is 5-6. If you can make it work, I'd appreciate it but if you can't schedule it earlier we can do after sunset.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'll be bringing lots of roses and flower petals regardless because mystic mess
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): that is SO MANY tables omg what do you do with them all
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): can do boudoir
i can change into katarina earlier, hope the costume doesn't get dirty or fall apart before judging (it better not omg i'm gonna pour my existence into it), and then do another costume at night instead. katarina was gonna be my friday night outfit but i can make her friday afternoon/evening instead so i'll change out of her after judging
Bill: You don't have to change your schedule to accomodate.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): so Friday will be like
Wedding Maki (Morning) --> Idol Maki (whenever i get sick of wedding maki because hard to move in) --> Katarina (Evening) --> something PJ's either Miku or maybe Tsuyu if people are doing BNHA PJs
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if you're willing to do after sunset i would be greatly appreciative but I know you're not wholly comfortable with it
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'm like 90% sure the mirror hallway is lit up. and the hallway where the elevators are? and I know for sure the stairs near the press lounge
Bill: We can do, I just work better with *light*.
Bill: Photography is painting with light after all.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): maybe the ballroom hallway will be lit up?
Bill: Okay, I need to focus on work so pause this.
Bill: I can do both, we'll figure out the details.
Bill: If Georgia answers my @ from earlier, and doesn't @ me back, someone @ so I see it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats like alot to do <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): you can do it!
