Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ***cracks knuckles***
Nokri (Fopdoodle): oki i think i see the issue, time for another render. i've sped up some parts for like .3 seconds so it might be wonky for a few frames but it fixes the timing issue
Nokri (Fopdoodle): *theoretically*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Nokri (Fopdoodle): HERE WE GO
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Andrew: im reading the rant thread and theres a lot of "more 18+ panels please"
Andrew: "there was a lack of video games and not enoiugh room to play smash, and smash is incrdibly popular"
Andrew: lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im gonna add one lol
Andrew: <@!351785752197201920> can attest?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): It's more that then take too long
Andrew: were they organized well?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Ehhhh
Andrew: like you knew where to go who to play when it came to it?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Nah they reshuffled it alot before the tournament
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): It was wierd
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I hear about real tournaments from Jared a lot
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): And it's not up to par
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I only really had three main issues with the con, from what was overall a positive experience: 
FORMAL BALL: For the cosplay formal ball, it seemed like the dress code had been basically abandoned. I was thoroughly confused to see people on the dancefloor in onesies, in rave gear, or even shirtless. Coupled with the shutter shades and glowsticks, it gave much more of a ‚Äúmini rave‚Äù feeling than a ‚Äúformal ball‚Äù one. And if I had wanted to go to a rave, I would‚Äôve gone to the actual dance later that night. Similarly, I saw girls show up in full ball gowns to the dance, and they looked absolutely miserable to be there. The guidebook may want to make it more explicitly clear what the suggested dress code is for these events. 

BURLESQUE: The set up for the burlesque was atrocious. The stage was too low, the screens were not positioned well for the audience to see, and half of the screen was taken up by footage of staff pacing up and down the aisles anyways. I felt bad leaving early because the performers were doing an amazing job, but the room and set up was not suited for viewing at all. This happens even when this event is one of the most popular at the con; the line for it extended from one side of the convention hall to the other! The burlesque would have done better in the room the dance was held in.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): CONVENTION PRICE: The con itself felt rather empty in comparison to past years. I have been attending AnimeNEXT every year since 2014, and I think a lot of people have started backing out of returning to the con due to cost. I heard many attendees remark that they have been enjoying the con for years, but only attend on Saturdays now specifically because of the expense. Atlantic City is expensive, and convention registration is becoming more so as well. It‚Äôs no secret that convention attendance hasn‚Äôt even approached the numbers that they saw in 2015. I think the higher ups should really evaluate where the money is going, and if there are opportunities to save money. I thoroughly enjoy AnimeNEXT every year, but there is a certain point where I feel like I am paying more than the weekend experience is worth. 

That being said, I hope that the con takes this criticism to heart. I enjoyed the friendly and knowledgeable staff, and seeing all the friends that attend the convention. The venue made for many gorgeous cosplay pictures, and I had an overall great time attending many of the events that were held. Hope to be there again in 2020!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _do facebook comments have a word count limit_
Nokri (Fopdoodle): i asked the organizers and they confirmed there was no dress code for the "formal" this year (it wasn't even a formal they said), but they said that next year it's definitely going to be formal with an enforced dress code. they shoulda made it clear the prom wasn't a formal ya
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _shirtless people tho_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): made it like an 80s rave
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o wow joe posted rwby shoot pics alreadyt
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no one can ever claim hes not enthusiastic
Bill: Unsorted unedited.
Bill: Hence the speed.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): still he probably got a lot of shots that weekend and still popped those suckers out
Nokri (Fopdoodle): if it's a big group shoot though do you really need to edit and sort them
Nokri (Fopdoodle): i've tried, it takes so long to edit every person and the background for every single shot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye like chucking out the bad shots?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont even have my vlog footage off my phone yet much less a whole set of photos from the weekend lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i think that guy said he worked as a nurse
Nokri (Fopdoodle): or just chucking the duplicate shots. that doesn't take too long, hour or so at most maybe, but editing all of them would take eternity
Bill: Oh yeah I wouldn't edit a group shoot anymore. I'd hit auto in lightroom and toss it out.
Bill: It's not that hard to get photos off a camera.
Bill: It took less than 5 minutes to clear my camera of everything I did friday.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): holy baloney he just sent me pyrrha and uraraka pics too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): all unedited, hes editting the other half still
Nokri (Fopdoodle): if i copy my photos anywhere it takes like 2 hours
Nokri (Fopdoodle): especially my phone that's an all day ordeal
Nokri (Fopdoodle): i got a new upload!! can someone check if this one is out of sync please? i think it looks alright on my end but so did the first one and that was a mess
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u_iUO1xfv0ynpc1zgUzR3uq_BAc9B5qB/view?usp=sharing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SPITS UNEDITTED HE JUST SENT ME 600 PHOTOS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i check for you!
Nokri (Fopdoodle): omg that's the dream right there
Bill: that's.
Bill: Weird.
Nokri (Fopdoodle): maybe he doesn't edit and just sends everything like flora does
Bill: But not filtering? Like, there has to bunches of duplicates of the same shot?
Bill: idk.
Nokri (Fopdoodle): just send 'em all, the cosplayer can filter them
Nokri (Fopdoodle): he said he's a nurse that's like 20 hour work days 6 days a week
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye it syncs up better mawisa!
Nokri (Fopdoodle): bless thank u
