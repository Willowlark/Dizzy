Bill: I need a clip on silver earring for Claude. I could amazon that, but i don't need 3-4 pairs so where does one find them in the *real* world?
Nokri (Marisa): i have gold clip ons somewhere
you can get like 50 from china for $1
Bill: I don't need 50 fake earrings, that's junk.
Nokri (Marisa): think of how swag you'd look wearing all of them at once
Nokri (Marisa): clip ons really aren't popular at all in the US i don't think. i can't recall ever seeing them in stores here. mmmmaybe clare's could have something?
Bill: Probs. 6 bucks for a single pair is fine from amazon, I just didn't want to be paying 12 for three, and the other two sets are gold/black.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I have silver eating cuffs from Amazon!
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): They were like 12 bucks I think
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I have those same ones, the gold silver and black ones lol
Bill: I need the key to my freaking mail box here so I can start buying stuff.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they didn't give that to you yet?
Bill: Last tenant didnâ€™t return them.
Bill: Post office had to make new ones.
Bill: However they dropped them off today woo
Bill: It's a thin slot. More likely they'll be dumping my stuff at the door.
Bill: me: only order the essentials you need for Claude:
