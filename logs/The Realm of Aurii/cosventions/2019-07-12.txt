Nokri (Marisa): Otakon badges have been mailed
Bill: This is happening again.
Nokri (Marisa): what an ominous picture
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): NOT AGAIN
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): THAT WAS AWFUK
Bill: yeah I don't have any motivation to go again either, but if friend's want to I would have. ðŸ˜‚
Nokri (Marisa): what happen?
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Too many people and weed
Nokri (Marisa): that's illegal
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i aint doin that again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anext guy sent me this
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Iâ€™m visiting home that weekend so Iâ€™d consider it!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And itâ€™s north jersey so itâ€™s near a lot of you Iâ€™d think
Nokri (Marisa): dang that's farther than new york
Aldus Larian (Jess): 47 mins from me
Aldus Larian (Jess): so what is it?
Aldus Larian (Jess): like just chillin in a park with photogs?
Nokri (Marisa): "meet and greet" is a weird description
Nokri (Marisa): or event title
Nokri (Marisa): funimation's in hot water again
that fruits basket voice actor event sign up was supposed to go live at 2pm but it dropped an hour early and everyone is **anger**
<:lenny:395307171539189760>
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): NOO
Nokri (Marisa): especially because some people booked otakon especially for these guests, and turns out there isn't even a public signing event so this messed up money grab was the only way to see them
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO
Nokri (Marisa): yeah, some people have plane tickets and otakon tickets and hotel reservations and bought special items **just** so they could meet these guests.

then they announce you can only meet them if you pay $65 and THEN are one of the first 50 people to sign up on a link

so people bought the $65 thing. then they posted the link an hour early and everyone goes on at 2 expecting it to be there and *all the tickets are gone because it was an hour early*

people are so anger :3c
Nokri (Marisa): The worst part is, the company probably wonâ€™t even acknowledge their mistake and will just wait for it to pass by.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yuppp
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does this like apply to us at all https://www.androidcentral.com/marriott-bonvoy-offering-free-night-after-two-stays

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I love morning mists sewing job
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But cannot handle the ridiculously nature of the outfit
Bill: Seeing people's art of it has given me hope. Doesn't help with the braid not making sense, but the outfit is growing on me.
Nokri (Marisa): braid makes a lot more sense than a loose ponytail in fighting
Bill: It's as long as her ponytail, and thicker.
Bill: She'd need to have obtained... more and longer hair for that to make sense.
Nokri (Marisa): hair dupe glitch irl
Nokri (Marisa): extensions
Kaio Vermino (Lee): She rapunzel wigged her hair with a foam core
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Shes using it at a buffer weapon now
Bill: ^ and these being the best explanations are why I find it ridiculous lol
Bill: Depending on the day I like the outfit more tho.
Nokri (Marisa): maybe that's not really weiss and they're pulling a shiro from voltron
Bill: Maybeh.
Bill: All of season 7 is actually a fever dream the Apathy give the team.
Bill: Final shot of the season is Ruby blearly waking up, chained up underneath that village with Cinder and Neo looking at her.
Bill: "Did you have a nice dream, Ruby, Rose?"
Nokri (Marisa): our sewing classes have little "why do you want to take this class?" thing on the sign up sheet
