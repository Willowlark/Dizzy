Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Saw Lee post their lineup to the Facebook group so I decided I might as well and 3 minutes later I get invited to be part of a group <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Nokri (Marisa): Oo I know her! She does a lot of groups, they kind of always fall apart
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Great üôÉ
Nokri (Marisa): Last one of hers I was in she messaged us the day of saying it wasn‚Äôt happening anymore
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like part of me wants to, but hearing that I'm like no thanks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm curious if I know anyone else in her group
Nokri (Marisa): Since you‚Äôre doing kirishima anyway it probably couldn‚Äôt hurt?
Nokri (Marisa): I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any fault of hers that they fell apart, it was probably just a bunch of bad coincidences
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): True
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I'll be in Kirishima all day so not like I'm not gonna get to do anything else as Kiri with ny'all
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh no, what an absolute bummer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I'll do the group thing. Can't be any worse than Darling last year <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Fucking RIP
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But you right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Still feel bad we never got that couple their photos üò¨
Nokri (Marisa): Oh no what happened with Darling :0
~~I feel like I‚Äôve asked before but can‚Äôt remember~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yeaaaaaa just added that to the massive list of reasons I dont like snow
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Although maybe it's for the best because that guy was not wearing a dance belt and it was VERY APPARENT he was not
Nokri (Marisa): O u c h
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üçÜ
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh uh it was a really unorganized shoot that snow insisted on shooting for us. We picked up a couple of cosplayers who were hiro and zero two 
We shot in the arcade but like really bad photos with no direction.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Snow never edited the photos and refused to give out the unedited ones
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Rebecca was supposed to get the photos from snow and edit them herself
Kaio Vermino (Lee): That never happened
Kaio Vermino (Lee): The couple was really looking forward to the photos
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I only feel bad about the couple's photos. I'm honestly glad I won't see the rest with me xD
Kaio Vermino (Lee): So I feel bad still
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea I dont want mine either tbh
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But those two were like really excited??
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And they got nothing back at all
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah and they were married I think?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea they were
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): At least it was a free shoot, but still
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Major bummer for them
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): aww ://
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yeaaa. Really shitty of snow too
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:pew:543202259085950996>
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): she just what? didnt wanna do it?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): literally volunteers to do it and then doesnt
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I guess so? Like I dont even understand the logic
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): amazing
outstanding move
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Dont volunteer if you dont want to do the thing abhshshsh
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ahh
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): damn right?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): like common sense
Bill: Man I‚Äôm the best. <:pew:543202259085950996>
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): <:pew:543202259085950996> .

Aldus Larian (Jess): I love her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): beautiful
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Also that shirt for zen is hella nice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah! I wanted something beachy but not stereotypical hawaiian shirt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it just dawned on me tonight that I should probably have tops to wear with my swim cosplays for walking around outside the waterpark
Aldus Larian (Jess): NAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): CCE is titties out
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jk it's totally a good idea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah but it cold outside the waterpark
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it really is
Nokri (Marisa): Oh thank goodness because I‚Äôm bringing fleece pants and shoes
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): day 0 last year was beatiful for like 2 hours
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): i used the outside pool
Nokri (Marisa): jess being so kawaii that her physical form blurs into the anime world
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Woah
Aldus Larian (Jess): "kaneki, shut the fuck up"
Nokri (Marisa): "Hi. I'm Red Riot. Here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have."
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"So... you got captured by villains..."*
Aldus Larian (Jess): amazing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): GOOD PHOTO
Nokri (Marisa): GOOD COSPLAY
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER
Nokri (Marisa): NO U
Bill: Can I borrow an Elizabeth for CCE? Probably Erik‚Äôs since Marisa‚Äôs electronics?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I bring catto
Aldus Larian (Jess): hey peeps tom and I were thinking about maybe going to Sandy Hook or Seven Presidents Beach tomorrow before beach time is over for the year. They are both free since its after labor day
Nokri (Marisa): tell the seven presidents i say hi if u go
Nokri (Marisa): wait which seven because i'm not the biggest fan of LBJ
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): if someone is there from a year divisible by 20 ask if they believe in  Tecumseh's curse
Aldus Larian (Jess): theres no lifeguard tho so fair warning about swimming
Bill: I would, but renn faire.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo yea
Bill: A boardwalk would still be neat even as fall rolls in.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea no boardwalks here just beach
Nokri (Marisa): Does CCE have a bag check? Like Otakon did
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think so
Nokri (Marisa): ~~can I keep blades on me~~
Nokri (Marisa): Dang it
Nokri (Marisa): [hides knife in swimsuit]
Aldus Larian (Jess): oH
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like that
Aldus Larian (Jess): I thought you meant like the hotel keeping bafs
Bill: They have lockers.
Bill: In the pool area.
Nokri (Marisa): Oooo thatd be nice too
Aldus Larian (Jess): No they don't check your bads
Bill: They don't have security.
Nokri (Marisa): I want to swim with a knife <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): At least the didn't last year
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm pretty sure they do a brief bag check before you go in the waterpark area
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh? Maybe I'm wrong? I thought they did
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did they? I don't remember that
Aldus Larian (Jess): But my memory is shit and also I dont think I had a bag
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe you didn't have a bag? I was with Rebecca a good chunk of last year and I'm pretty sure I always had to wait for her to get it checked
Bill: I don't remember you ever bringing one.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's nothing like Otakon though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if it exists
Bill: The only thing they'd care about is a gun, or outside liquor that keeps you from buying theirs.
Nokri (Marisa): Nice I don‚Äôt have to empty my bag out
Bill: More the latter.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but CCE just posted the rules they received from the kalahari and no blades
Nokri (Marisa): Oh darn you know how much I love carrying liquor with me. What a let down
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's why you carry outside liquor in your stomach when you go in <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs just tiny self defense things, I figured they‚Äôd be necessary at CCE because of all the people in swimsuits and creeps I‚Äôve seen on the CCE discussion threads, I‚Äôm not gonna carry a machete in with me. But that would be so sweet
Nokri (Marisa): I‚Äôve never been so idk how security is and if people get harassed often. I assume so because late night events and drinking? Idk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): stand near any one of us and you will have anti-harassment protection
Nokri (Marisa): Dw I‚Äôll protect y‚Äôall to üî™ üõ° üí™
Bill: If you don't go off on your own, you'll be okay.
Bill: Is anyone else getting there earlier afternoon? <@!334090409389195266> maybe? Erik?
Aldus Larian (Jess): What's earlier afternoon?
Bill: before 3ish?
Aldus Larian (Jess): And I can't speak for over all but I've never been harassed or anything
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ill prob be there like at 3
Bill: I'm thinking of doing a massage thursday again too because treat yo self, and I've been so high strung it's worth it. But I'd wanna do it before people came down. The only one I'm shooting thursday is Lee, but I need... *fam*, for CCE so I dunt wanna be in the spa when everyone's there.
Bill: Except for sunday, me and Erik can go to the spa hangout place <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): O oo
Bill: Huh. I just realized I imagined a why in your response.
Bill: Oops.
Bill: Like I totally thought there was one.
Bill: Maybe I was thinking about something else and it crossed streams, like when you talk and write and you start writing what your saying not what you need write.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I plan on getting there whenever I know people will be there so maybe like 3ish as well?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh, meant to post this earlier when we were talking about it
Nokri (Marisa): Iiii can‚Äôt use the bathroom because the wig parts are drying in the tub hahaha
Iiii should‚Äôve planned this out better rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): You can't use the bathroom at all?
Nokri (Marisa): I can use the sink and that‚Äôs about it
Nokri (Marisa): To use the toilet I need the bathtub
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ohhhh ok gotcha
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Why do you need the tub for the toilet?
Nokri (Marisa): It doesn‚Äôt flush and the pipe is broken so it has to be manually flushed by filling a up a bucket
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ah
Nokri (Marisa): There‚Äôs no water in the tank, the toilet itself basically doesn‚Äôt have any water in it. The pipe next to it that controls the water going through doesn‚Äôt work properly, but it leaks, that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a plastic container on the ground and a towel on the floor. That black bucket there has to get filled up if anyone needs to use the toilet
Nokri (Marisa): And this is basically the only spot the bucket can be filled up but I was stupid and put the wig there to dry lol
Nokri (Marisa): That also leaks and messed up the wall but we taped it so it leaks less <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üò≠
Nokri (Marisa): And if the little clear container isn‚Äôt emptied every so often, there‚Äôs a hole in the ground there that leaks into the kitchen <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Well, to lighten the mood, Starry is staffing CCE so we get to see her again <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): o i'm really sorry üôÄ i didn't mean to drag the mood down, this is just normal for me so i was complaining about my own stupidity

starry shyroo?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah!
Nokri (Marisa): woo! is hammertime cosplay gonna be there <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): she must've felt awkward around him during katsu hehe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nope! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> looks like karaoke is every Friday so we can plan that trip sometime.
Bill: Me: better pack the small camera kit for the Renn Faire to not be bogged down
Also me: Bring the full kit and use the film camera while you're there
Bill: oops all cameras
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They didn't have film cameras in the renaissance. You have to capture all of your favorite moments via oil painting
Bill: But they do have DSLRs? XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Well no, but you said specifically "film camera"
Bill: I‚Äôm bringing both <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Why <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): What about karaoke at CCE <:rapid:607237006539489310>
