Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is that the Sakura Sunday schedule
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What’s our squad plan for that
Bill: Sounds like Tom, Jess, Marisa and I are at least going to Kogara, we'll take Marisa up for a sleepover, then drive down to sakura sunday and drop Marisa off in the process. Beyond that much shrug.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m awake now <:rise:557579163511554050>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im prob doing kogara too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i dont think im gonna cosplay to sakura
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I kinda want to check out Sakura
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): prob will just go in reg clothes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and enjoy it
Aldus Larian (Jess): it think my decision on copaly will be based on weather
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Your Casual Leanna™ cosplay
Bill: I'm tempted to only bring the film camera for Sakura Sunday. Aesthetic.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I might wanna do a yukata or cheongsam but not suuuurr
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye i'm considering making some kind of yukata or kimono but idk what character to do for that
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't find my glasses
N🆗ri (Marisa): i last had them at 5am
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I would consider a cosplay but  I would have to make something and Sakura Sunday is between GREs and exams lmaoooo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So it’s regular Georgia or some yukata thing prob
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea... i dont have anything asian inspired
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i dont have time to make anything before sakura
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i dont really wanna just...cosplay to cosplay
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats what kogara ia for
Bill: You can probably amazon a cheongsam or yukata if you want to be in the spirit but not cosplay. But casual would be fine at Sakura tbh.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): for something id prob never wear again
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): meh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll check out yukatas and probably decide from there
Bill: I mean, cheongsam are cute as fuck so. Easily could reuse.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i dont like them, rip~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yukatas are cute tho
Bill: Then ye *probably* don't want one.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im gonna cosplay a normie
N🆗ri (Marisa): Cheongsam are super cute but also Chinese 💃 ~~but don’t let that discourage u from wearing one because cute~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think well prob do yukata 9s and 2b
N🆗ri (Marisa): I found my glasses they’re in my hair
Elfriede Faun (Tom): We also have the Hiyoris and yato
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But they bath robes
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh true
Aldus Larian (Jess): but that wig
Bill: lol mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know if i wanna deal with log wig outside all day
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hiyori puts her hair up when she wears a yukata
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye but i dont know i can get it to go up with my limited wog skills
Aldus Larian (Jess): plus it heavy
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s ok tom is strong he can hold it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The yukatas on Amazon are damn cute wow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lol I just saw someone with the same hoodie as Erik and Bill at the Rutgers bus stop
Bill: Sakura Sunday may be a good entry level fandom event for Noah. Much more cultural and normie friendly than cons. fyi since you've never been.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hUH YEAH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Didn’t even think of that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I imagine it’s like a normie festival where lots of cosplayers happen to go
Bill: Mhmm.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SO CUTE???
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ahh thats really cutttte
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg i live for news like this
https://soranews24.com/2019/03/26/immigration-raid-at-anime-convention-ends-with-five-japanese-cosplayers-being-arrested-overseas/
N🆗ri (Marisa): What a tragedy
Elfriede Faun (Tom): There's so many cute short "kimonos"
Bill: Perfect quotation there.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt see those last year when i was buying hoyoris 😭
Bill: That pink one will blend into the trees though. Assuming the trees are actually in bloom the weekend of.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OOPS TIME TO BUY MORE
Andrew: oohhh sunday reminder gotta buy my ticket
N🆗ri (Marisa): the issue with cosplaying canon kimono designs is finding the fabric afegrsthdjyfku
Andrew: If i could do the wig right summer festival ryoma
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh ya know what
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Kimono/yukatas mean no sneakers
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and sneakers are good for the feets
N🆗ri (Marisa): kind of wanna cosplay spirited away
N🆗ri (Marisa): you could do sneakers. some girls in japan wear sneakers with yukata but others say it ruins the aesthetic
N🆗ri (Marisa): touhou would also be great but i'm not bringing armpit fetish to sakura sunday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _armpit fetish_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Studio ghibli would be cute...
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Which touhou
N🆗ri (Marisa): reimu
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I only know poofy hat girl
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And I've played it
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~valid question i have multiple touhou costumes~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ooooo studio ghibli
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): if anyone ever does a ghibli group at a con i've been looking for an excuse to wear my haru dress again
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://i.gifer.com/1zS7.gif
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Chihiro be fun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Kiki would be easy AF
Elfriede Faun (Tom): MONONOKE KIMONO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and I have a lil black cat
N🆗ri (Marisa): desire
https://www.amazon.com/YOMORIO-Japanese-Cardigans-Cosplay-Costume/dp/B07NQJJKTX/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=cosplay+yukata&qid=1553616757&s=gateway&sr=8-3
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooo I think I actually have a Jiji
N🆗ri (Marisa): i forgot i already have a laputa costume too
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've wanted to do sophie but that's got a strong western vibe
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But ghibli is Japanese
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye! it japanese!
but the original howl's moving castle story is british and a lot of them are based in the far-off magical land of europe/western countries
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): leaning towards doing chihiro but i've never tied a tasuki hmm
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to dump some yellow paint on some white shoes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I almost bought that figure so many times <:woah:543194447345876998>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It was like 20 bucks on ebay
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Mary and the witches flower is British too
N🆗ri (Marisa): buy buy buy
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's called like uhhhhh Little broomstick
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You could do chihiro I believe
N🆗ri (Marisa): i promised i would stop cosplaying children yet here i am again
what fabric do i even make chihiro out of. cotton would wrinkle so much and is probably what they used but we don't have chirimen in the US. lyocell?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Do they call her sen or sin?
N🆗ri (Marisa): sen!
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can't pronounce "sin" in japanese it would have to be pronounced as "shin"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lemme to tell Dave o was right then
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oo sihn is a dragon from dark souls
N🆗ri (Marisa): because the first character in chihiro that's pronounced "chi" when paired with other kanji means 1,000 and is pronounced "sen" on its own when no other kanji are present
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm gonna rewatch the movie tonight because i found a good reference that proves her sleeves are what i thought they are but i can't find what her pants are
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://i.gifer.com/3hI2.gif
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ah! Thank you history
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wow auto correct killing me
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THANK FOR LESSON SENSEI
N🆗ri (Marisa): Don’t touch my mustache
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru do you know if sensei still goes to sakura sunday

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): me @ myself: <:5142_then_perish:554720548274569246>
N🆗ri (Marisa): 2.5 weeks *plenty of times u can do it*
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's basically a white apron over a blue jibei
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm i don't have a jinbei pattern, just lots of kimono/yukata/hakama patterns and this suikan pattern
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh google has a bunch for free. sweet.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): HAKUUUU
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Dragon form
Elfriede Faun (Tom): All out bby
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i might actually pull haku out my ass
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >.>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because apparently i have no boudaries when it comes to stuffing my plate with projects
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaoio
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Your too powerful
N🆗ri (Marisa): this has jinbei patterns for free but requires 30-50 pages of paper to print it on <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

N🆗ri (Marisa): we should make party invitation props
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yesss
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was sad because I thought y’all were only doing it at zenkai
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I started watching a MysMe cosplay panel video but I didn't watch all of it because it was long lol. But they had all the characters and gave a general overview of the game and then did skits and they handed out party invitations that had all the cosplayers' contact info
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But no, I definitely would love to do MM with you guys more. I want to do Zen at some point
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no I'll basically do MM whenever cuz I'm trash and I need to cosplay with you as ray again.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Must fix jacket <:woah:543194447345876998> 
I can grab more fabric for that when I get my Chihiro stuff in class this week
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think your jacket looked fine but I know u wanna re do it
Bill: We. LITERALLY told you to cosplay Ray again so we could squad up with you.
Bill: What did you think we meant by that.
Bill: Let himself go after Rika “died” ! V is always ready.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jacket was literally held together with hopes and dreams and the collar was wrong because I made it in half an hour
I thought maybe like in our dreams we’d do mystic mess or we’d photoshop someone better into the ray pics idk
Bill: NO ONE BETTER.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You da best Ray
N🆗ri (Marisa): Biru get V on right now. Always ready. Like a superhero. Just wear V under everything like Superman
N🆗ri (Marisa): Some girl gets her purse stolen on the street. You can’t catch the thief but you can rip your shirt off and turn into V.
Bill: You forgot let himself go after Rika “dies” ! V.
Bill: Marisa has mastered male gaze and it’s adorable.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow, what a guy *~swoons~*

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Dibs on blonde MC
Bill: Besidesssss Rika isn’t bad. She’s just what? Obsessive, needs everyone to love her?  Narcissistic?
Bill: Erika x Seven.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Actually blonde MC is definitely a Georgia look: tm:
Bill: But it’s also actually you so.
Bill: ~~Georgia would want the redhead cause strong red heads~~
Bill: Speaking of fake fan tho.
Bill: Are there like. Let’s plays of MM on YouTube? Specifically V’s route? Or V heavy things?
Bill: Or do I have to buy all the things or play the terrible time based game for character knowledge.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I changed to default MC because it bothered me that all the pictures with her didn't match the avatar lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It'd be neat if they had versions for all the mc's ~~especially the unicorn one~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, I love that the unicorn ons is jacked
Bill: ~~you just want to be unicorn one~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You can at least find the endings on YouTube
