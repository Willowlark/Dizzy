Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo so early
Bill: How look.
Bill: Gotta send her the ones I liked, which is a fair handful. She’s supposed to send me ones she took of me too, at some point.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo I could get free admission to Sakura Sunday if I staff it 👀 
They really gotta send out info for that earlier though. Two weeks is awful notice so I won’t do it.
Bill: I will buy your ticket.
Bill: Anime next is one thing, but for 10 bucks you should get to hang with us for the day.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do Not™
Bill: <@!350855105123319808> you DID get it in the shot!
Bill: Y’all though picture.
Bill: She a wedding photog I don’t wanna send a shitty image over.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it looks good. It's very well lit
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh the girl in charge of the Sakura Sunday cosplay stuff messaged me. She said signups open this weekend.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: Thank Erik...
N🆗ri (Marisa): thanks Erik
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think the photo looks good too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That ring light looks really cool
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Should incorporate that into cosplay work somehow one day
Bill: Be very hard outside of a portrait. Small ring.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Still would be cool for something I'm sure
N🆗ri (Marisa): More and more zenkai tea comes to light each day
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🍵
N🆗ri (Marisa): We only raised $2750???? For charity?? No way. No way it should be way more than that unless they seriously messed up the charity auction.
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s tea about the auction too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): O no 😭
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Zenkai doing a bit flop? :(
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > posts Kiri/Kami photos from Katsu

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@301927856240459777>  I thought zenkai had lower attendence?
N🆗ri (Marisa): it picked up through at-con attendance!
N🆗ri (Marisa): we had a big last minute surge but we were in trouble at first
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ohhh nnkay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow only 5500?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 5970 people total!
That’s around the usual for Zenkai
N🆗ri (Marisa): But that’s a lot of free badges and we definitely don’t have that many staff <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Andrew: About how much staff dod you have
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is a picture of our all staff meeting
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not all staff are there since some arrived late, but a good majority
N🆗ri (Marisa): And registration members aren’t there because they were working reg
Andrew: Sooooo... not a lot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): weird question
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but why so many old people on staff
Bill: huh.
Bill: There are aren't there.
Andrew: 大人がたくさんいるね
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not 470
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg there’s no internet in this place aaa
Old people wanna enjoy the con and see their friends but also wanna sit in one place so staffing is appealing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o ya know that makes sense
N🆗ri (Marisa): 21歳以上じゃないとコンベンションで働けない
N🆗ri (Marisa): だからみんな大人だよ
Andrew: そうだよ
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): いいえ君

Aldus Larian (Jess): Do they pay you in fabric?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!! They take it out of the paycheck <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye I get wholesale price instead of retailer :3c I am many appreciative
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA that's really neat!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Just don't go hungry~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): OMG A LITTLE GIRL WALKED IN and my mother introduced me to her before apparently and this little girl I know nothing about came over and was like “are you Marisa? Can you teach me to make RWBY clothing? I want to be Nora” and I was like “<:woah:543194447345876998> YEAH I CAN LETS GET YOU SOME FABRIC”

You too eric
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo that's nice!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He also has a (I think) kimono (?) but it has the Lions Club logo all over it (I'm guessing that's how he was able to go? His dad was involved with Lions Club)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Is the black one something that would be worn outside? Or is it like an "in the privacy of your own home" type of garment? It's basically just a long shirt
