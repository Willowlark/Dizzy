秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): If the stars align properly and I make it to Kotoricon (all my flights *should* be ok) I wanna cosplay Blake if she fits. I have a wig I can use and shoes that aren’t exact but they’re close enough.
If she doesn’t fit or I can’t find the shoes I’ll do whatever school uniform I can find, like Ochako or Chise or PJ/WiM Miku. Can’t do Hiyori cuz I already wore her at Kotori once, I’d like to do Sheryl but honestly it’s gonna take me at least 5 years to start unpacking so that uniform will still be packed up.
Bill: Well, you saw Georgia is planning something for her place. I dunno if you want to do a sleepover so soon after getting home, but everyone will probably do that instead of KotoriCon.
Bill: That’s an option too.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ye but that’s far and she has cosplayers for it already 👌 
If it’s Friday into Saturday I wouldn’t arrive until like 3am. My cat might also be a bit mad. And I can’t miss kotoricon now owo
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): They livestream it right? I can watch that!
Bill: No, it’s Saturday night lol.
Bill: Saturday into Saturday night and Sunday Cosplay workshop?
Bill: And it’s not an exclusive cosplays event.
Bill: I dunno what it’ll even be, asides from friends/BNE gathering.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ooo. I would like to go a lot but it might be too soon after returning and too far.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I wouldn’t be able to bring any cosplay materials to work on
Bill: You can just guide all the scrubs.
Bill: ~~and no one gets anything done at those workshops anyway~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): But it’s a workshop they gotta *work*
Bill: Yeaaaaah noooooo
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m not good at cosplaying I rush 90% of my costumes and make 3 in 3 days before the con which is why I’m determined not to rush Katsu’s outfits 💪
Bill: That’s okay!
Bill: That’s why your the cosplay master.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): cosplay mudperson
Bill: COSPLAY HERO
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Thats why I’m so torn up about Katsu, I want to enter the contest and I classify as beginner but I feel I’m not beginner? So I could enter as novice, but then what if I’m really not that good enough for novice and am really a beginner? HmmMm. All my past costumes for contests had rushed bits that looked awful and showed, like ranka’s had with its frayed edges and Lucina’s gold trim, but I was complemented on certain other aspects for creativity.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I guess it’s ok to enter as beginner? The girl who won animenext had a gorgeous costume it was stunning, she was a sewing and fashion major and making clothes was her job and she entered novice so maybe it’s ok to do beginner?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): TLDR why do I always rush
Bill: Think about it like this, you’re a beginner for contest entries.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): ZOOOM
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Tttttttrue
All the judges know me though lol I’ve entered about once or twice a year since 2014 and I’ve worked with them
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Nylon

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): There I did t
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): The judges aren’t biased though. Dizzy knows me the most whereas the others are like acquaintances so dizzy would likely leave the room for my judging and abstain
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Unless you make a nylon cosplay
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Then it's nyoom nylon
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Time to remake neon to glow in the dark
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): My greatest fear is trying so hard not to rush Katarina that I rush to finish her too early <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Embrace your inner perfectionist.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I can if I can use the tables at jack’s store!! Sewing is hard without tables or space. But jack said I can use the tables at his store. All I have to worry about then are nosy gossipy housewives taking sewing lessons next to me. That sounds horrible I’m sure they’re fantastic people but people there love to talk and chatter and when I sew I enter the Sew Zone™
