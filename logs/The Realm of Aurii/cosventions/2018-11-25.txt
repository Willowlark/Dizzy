No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Deltarune Suneday after mystic ness would be perfect. I was considering that but most of the con would be over maybe so I didn‚Äôt want to bring it up, but if you guys are open to that it would work
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): yea i know itll be pretty late in the cons life, but were pretty much out of "timeslots" to do it during one of the more lively days
although katsu is packed always so  üòÑ
Bill: Not like we need the con to shoot.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he doesnt mean photoshoot slots thou, just costume slots
Bill: Tis combination makes me think Fallout.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ah fudge. hall contest might require signing up in advance. there's no info about it but their website seems to imply that. i follow their posts but if anyone sees Katsu make an announcement about hall cosplay could you please let me know. if it's when i'm asleep just vigorously ping me until i wake up.
