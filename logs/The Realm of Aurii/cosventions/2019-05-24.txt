Andrew: that reminds me i have 2 wigs i have to try and style
Andrew: keyword try
Nokri (Marisa): you can do it ‚≠ê i worked on raphtalia's wig today
every time i look at it, it can be improved so i've decided to undergo it bit by bit <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): the more i horribly burn myself the more heat resistant i become right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

Andrew: thats not reality unfortunately
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The bun at the top is making me laugh
Bill: Samurai Mirio!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Cindy lou wait-wait that's better
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I actually got pretty far on the wig today xD a lot left to do but I cut it all to the correct length and pinned the sides wheres they will end up being once I use product. And sectioned off his top spike poof thing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): A couple hours ago it looked like android 18
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So that's pretty good <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

Nokri (Marisa): I have to wait for this ridiculous chest plate to cool before I can move
I think this is as smooth as I can get the plastic üò≠ im gonna douse it in wood glue after trimming some parts in hopes that the glue makes it smoother
Nokri (Marisa): I‚Äôm anime now
Andrew: kawaii
Nokri (Marisa): Thanks I woke up like this
Nokri (Marisa): New light novel title idea:
I went to sleep and when I woke up I was a selfie filter in another world!?
Andrew: you could write it
Nokri (Marisa): Still a work in progress the title is nowhere near long enough
Andrew: i cant get the spikes on my wig to stand up
Nokri (Marisa): How spiky are you making it? His hair isn‚Äôt super Saiyan levels
Andrew: just a little flick upwards for some of his spikes
Andrew: like on the top
Andrew: but they all just hang down
Andrew: gravity and whatnot
Andrew: i need to trima  bit i think
Nokri (Marisa): Have you tried blow drying it upside down?
Nokri (Marisa): Leanna‚Äôs famous Bakugo method
Andrew: no  didnt try that
Nokri (Marisa): If anyone has recommendations for my armor up there I would be forever grateful ;u; if not I‚Äôll just go with that plan and hope it doesn‚Äôt fail horribly
Andrew: unfortunately i havent used plastic
Aldus Larian (Jess): That look gud mawisa
Nokri (Marisa): Is bumpy like tortoise shell
Gotta get it smooth like a turtle shell
Aldus Larian (Jess): It gud
Nokri (Marisa): Garbag√©
Andrew: 
Andrew: all i ahve so far
Nokri (Marisa): Wog
Andrew: it looks bad
Nokri (Marisa): Naw
Did you trim the bangs?
Andrew: no
Andrew: havent done much other than shape a few bangs
Nokri (Marisa): You should trim it before continuing to style, will make it easier
Andrew: how do i know where to trim
Nokri (Marisa): If you cut it after styling it might lose the styling
Nokri (Marisa): I just put mine on and cut it in the mirror
Nokri (Marisa): Use a reference photo
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!386874959009415170>

Bill: Time to justify the purchase of the waterproof bag I bought on sale thinking I'd some how need it for CCE. I need something smaller than my duffel for a one night trip and that's the best option I have lol.
Nokri (Marisa): Chalk is such a blessing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh heads up, apparently there is a $3 cover for the show
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): sorry, I didn't realize that

Aldus Larian (Jess): i thought u were dying your hair XD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lol nope just a better way to use contact cement than to use the can and a stick every time
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEP
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh watch out, it'll collapse in on itself initially
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Or it did for me as it outgassed

Bill: Do you have a vague idea of when it'll be? Saturday between 4-8 or something like that?
Glonk: Forbidden mustard
Nokri (Marisa): Saturday between 4-8 is likely the masquerade. Judging could be any time before that from like 9 o clock onwards.
Nokri (Marisa): Last time I think my time was around 10;30?

Bill: So Raph in the morning?
Bill: Trying to figure out for shooting you and Andrew.
Nokri (Marisa): Most of the day because y‚Äôall keep yelling at me to wear costumes more, and because I don‚Äôt feel like changing back into her for the masquerade
Bill: You LISTEN to all that?
Bill: I'm legitimately touched.
Nokri (Marisa): Is why I‚Äôm not doing corn

Bill: Masq starts at 4?
Nokri (Marisa): I dunno. Usually it does I think? they‚Äôve been getting earlier
Bill: Cause there are group shoots 12-4 I'mma be at, Andrew at most of...
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo. That‚Äôs the prime time I‚Äôd be able to do it oops

Nokri (Marisa): You have to have made at least 70% of the costume yourself though
Nokri (Marisa): Oh rip the internet is gone
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah judging doesn‚Äôt take long, most of it is sitting and waiting
