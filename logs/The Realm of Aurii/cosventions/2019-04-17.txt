this looks fair
Andrew: and the reviews are good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The photo from that one guy who bought it looks pretty good
Andrew: Yes i was thinking that the biggest part will be spiking up the bangs
Andrew: but the back doesnt look bad
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea it looks pretty good and its cheap
Bill: Zeikani a trip.
Bill: I wanna book her for CPAC... But I dunno for what.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lewds apparently
Bill: She's just meming.
Bill: Can't do BNHA cause wog, Hazel is a solo act... I have no particularly inspiration for any solo cosplay tbh.
Bill: That or I just slip someone money for a shoot with her so I can see how she does photatos.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Shit I gotta order materials
Bill: I really don't look bad at all in Hazel.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it looks good on you!
Bill: like this has quality double chin view, but. I realize I can't fault her for being shorter than me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but you dont have a double chin in that photo at all
Bill: *You flatterer you*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im not even trying to be nice lmao, you genuinely dont
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i only see one chin
Bill: da neck flab doe.
N🆗ri (Marisa): one chin, the usual number
Bill: She got a couple of really nice ones tho.
Bill: They’re overall pretty dark but she’s pretty universally rough on exposure. And doesn’t seem to have the post ability to make up for it.
Bill: It also suits Hazel which helps.
Bill: Zeikani doing prop commissions, she's done Nier stuff...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!245270932602486784> probably not gonna stay over after CPAC
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so if we wanna watch the My Hero movie we could do it Friday night

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ethan: *What the fuck music is this? Where's the screaming?*
Aldus Larian (Jess): "im not into this sissy shit"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "i listen to real music"

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀 👀 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ethan isn’t gonna wanna see young the giant
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): too bad
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): casey would ~~pretty sure?~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rutgers got them privately too, this tour stop isn’t even listed on their tour dates ahhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m not obsessed with them but I like them and this is a cool opportunity?
Bill: Tell Ethan 
A. you already bought the tickets
B. you are the party planner and this is what you set up
C. Your prior plans fell through because of X
D. "You're an asshole trying to force me to throw you a party, take it or leave it but I already bought Casey's ticket."
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~I don’t really want to have to pay for them either~~
Bill: Don't? It's a cheap as fuck concert.
Bill: Again, he's already an ungrateful dick, may as well get something good out of his complaining.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _im gonna put it in the event, Leanna and Erik comment really enthusiastically about it if you wanna go_
Bill: Better listening to music than Ethan talking about himself.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i asked ethan
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): directly
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but yea put it in the event
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah said he would come too owo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Throws Noah at ethan “sorry babe just talk music”
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah has an expensive bass so maybe ethan would respect him??? Prob not lmao let’s be real
