N🆗ri (Marisa): I’d also like to get some traction out of costumes I don’t wear often. Maybe I’ll wear them and play music or autotune my singing to post.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’d like to do Cold as Pyrrha but that’s a Jaune song rip
Bill: Cold was about Monty I thought.
N🆗ri (Marisa): O it was?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh yeah huh. 
Based on the lyrics I always thought it was a song Jaune sang about Pyrrha
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pyrrha and Shine? But I have no space to dance rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): Neon and neon song <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Yeah good plans. You could reuse costumes for all the cons in the next two years except for contest entries and we’d still only see you in “new” costumes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I gotta wear some of the ones I got in japan too. I only wore 14 of them last year
Andrew: So Castle point wont happen for me
Andrew: rip
Bill: 😭
Andrew: mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no :C
Andrew: really rip, i wanted to test Norman out
Andrew: but on the plus side i have a lot of hours next week to save for the summer cons
Bill: That good. We got ota and next.
Bill: Not too much in the way of day cons.
Bill: But we’ve gotta do a city trip soon and you should meet us for that.
Andrew: i was talking to aaron that i wanted to do a city trip
Andrew: like
Andrew: bee a tourist
Andrew: he goes up to nyc to do GO on occasion
Andrew: let me know what day and ill put in for it
Andrew: earlier the better
Bill: No idea yet.
N🆗ri (Marisa): “If” Yang was a furry
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: "If"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Had a dream you all showed up at my old apartment complex in cosplay with some famous cosplayers in tow and asked if we wanted to take pictures. Then hundreds of cosplayers showed up after.
Also Ray William Johnson was on the couch on his lap top, apparently he lived with us.
Bill: Sounds better than my dream!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I had a dream I was late for work and then I woke up and I still had an hour to sleep
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I probably had a more eventful dream but I forgot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH BUT LAST NIGHT I HAD A DREAM THAT WAS WEIRD I dreamed that the head of the physics department told me I could choose any professor to receive an award and two to be fired
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I said to reward professor Vanderbilt but woke up before I could have anyone fired
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And yesterday Prof Vanderbilt announced that he received an induction into a prestigious physics society
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I was like YO
Bill: Prophetic dreams. Add some narcissism and your A2 wig and you’re fem!Zen.
N🆗ri (Marisa): O I’ve been meaning to ask a question about cosplay photography for weeks I keep forgetting 
I’ll find an example picture when I’m actually awake but what do you guys think of photos that don’t show someone’s face, just part of the costume. I think they’re really neat but idk if they’d be popular as a style.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think it only works for certain costumes
Bill: Yeah. Hunter does those for weapon shots.
Bill: Doable.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah works for some things
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Noice prediction too 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is what reminded me of it
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://twitter.com/n_and_you05/status/1117405298149322752
N🆗ri (Marisa): stuff like that?
Bill: it's doable. It's not usually to my taste though. I like faces.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i might start doing it. no one's gonna see their face ever again.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think it really works for cosplay because it helps with that suspension of disbelief
Bill: But then how will you know whose in the photo? the wig work? And it's nice to have people look at you and say 'wow you look like X'.
Bill: Oh. Damn. I had another dream, where Artoria Grey talked to me in a dealers hall like 'hey wazzup' and that was not a thing.
Bill: Forgot about that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wig photos can be taken from the back
you know who's in the photo by who posted it
you can look like X, like it's obvious who's in the pictures from that twitter link without seeing their faces or hair
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: I know I would not be happy if I only got close ups of the outfit from a set.
Bill: I have no craftsman pride, cause I bought everything so maybe that's why it's different.
Bill: But those are arts shots which are cool, but there's a reason standard stuff is always good. People want to see themselves look good.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wouldn't necessarily be close-ups. i can still take face pictures *i guess* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
but i might like to experiment with pictures like that if anyone is interested
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think they do look good!
Bill: Go for it ye. Just don't *only* do that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): in my head cosplaying isn't about becoming your character, it's about representing them if that makes sense. i don't expect cosplayers to act like their characters all the time, maybe just when a kid walks up or for a joke, and pictures/videos are a way of turning 2D anime into 3D representations of the show. so shots like that which look like they could be screenshots from a movie are really neat, and it leaves a lot up to the viewer's imagination as to what's going on
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, we know that's riza and roy. we can't see anything other than a single glove and a hip bag in one image that tells us that, but we know even if we didn't see those things and that's the powah of cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~maybe it's because i don't have a good face~~ or because i have a hard time seeing anyone as a 'canon' cosplayer so the faceless images are more appealing
Bill: You have a great face for cosplay.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u
N🆗ri (Marisa): why can't twitter let you copy one image from a set aeysr
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I like ones that dont show my face
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's kinda cinematic
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And shows off how hard cosplayers work on their costumes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So the viewer doesnt get distracted by their great face and not look at anything else
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's a good point yeah, sometimes in cosplay music videos i get frustrated because it just shows a close-up of the cosplayer's face which is lovely but *show us the costume we wanna see that beadwork and piping*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's a good way to show how much time and effort you put into the costume and basically force the viewer to see it and see the character you are portraying instead of them stopping at "look this cosplayer has a pretty face" double tapping and then moving on without seeing any work you put in
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Of course I love face pics too, but i think it's also important to get photos that show off the costume itself
N🆗ri (Marisa): i bet "faceless photography" is already taken as a photographer name. rats.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Shucks
N🆗ri (Marisa): there are so many examples of this style of photography from japan but of course when you go to look for examples they're impossible to find <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: What's good is a mix.
Bill: Just doing one or the other isn't good.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea a nix
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Mix
Bill: You'll get away with just doing glamour shots because it's more "industry standard" but  if people get a bunch of photos with no faces I can imagine them hiring someone else.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was being sarcastic when i said i'd never take another face pic <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
or maybe i'll exclusively shoot spirited away no face cosplayers. that's it. everyone else is outta luck.
Bill: ~~oh whoops~~
Bill: You got me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): faces will be cropped out of every single image i've already taken
N🆗ri (Marisa): even if they're in the center
N🆗ri (Marisa): cropped
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think im gonna bump dunkin donuts to a sunday or part friday of a big con
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): better recognition that way, and getting a possible group would be cool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im gonna fix star and wear her for next saturday i think
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): unless a coordinated group has started up yet 👀
Bill: Nothing yet.
Bill: I’ve got Hazel and Barry... can’t Mirio cause no wog. Or Pilot Boi I guess. That’d be hot but suffering.
Bill: Is Justin free to do Marco for you?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he said maybe
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he has work half the day apparently
Bill: Aaaah.
Bill: That’d be that.
Bill: I’m not sure what I wanna do, if anything since everyone’s doing their own thing.
Bill: Someone decide something.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have no idea what I'm doing either lol
Bill: Closet cosplay Resident Evil.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dang I forgot how insane my Lucina outfit is. This thing is intense.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Why can’t I sew stuff like this anymore wow
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pro; this costume is gorgeous and a perfect fit
Con: *it fits too well I can’t use my fake chest*
N🆗ri (Marisa): *or can i*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Bill: Yeah spring Lucina was adorable!
N🆗ri (Marisa): The gold definitely needs fixing but the rest is fantastic like I’m amazed I was able to make something like this. Maybe I didn’t and I fever dreamed it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are u doing Lucina post for Easter or her birthday? Or both at once?
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH SNAP IT IS HER BIRTHDAY
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): double purpose post!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Aww man I forget where I put her cuffs
N🆗ri (Marisa): Gotta hide my hands
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Matt just asked me if I wanted to room with them again for Katsu 😬
Aldus Larian (Jess): Big oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was just like "I think I'm roomming with Bill and them"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Welcome to aurii
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You can never leave
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): (I mean you could but also like why would you wanna)
Bill: What... is the katsu group.
Bill: Me, Tom, Jess, Georgia, Marisa, Erik...
Bill: ~~why would I want to leave is why I don’t meet people at cons rip~~
Bill: Dave was talking about it? Leanna has her squad? No Scott. Anna and Mag... iiiidk, depending on space and if they do it but they’ll probably commute from Mags? Ash was thinking about it cause the siege cosplayers?
Bill: Andrew maybeh?
Bill: We have a 10 cap rather than 12 with the atrium king<>queen rooms...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kurtis?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kurtis prob with leanna
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tristan is available, tho he usually waits for the invite
Bill: dunno if Kurto wants to pay for this nonsense.
Bill: I’m sure Tristan is. But I want him to contact us to join for once. *And don’t tell him that it’d defeat the purpose.*
Bill: I don’t really feel like trying to manage a third room so I guess it’ll be first come first serve for the additional spaces.
Bill: We hit 10 we hit 10.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but he said he dun like asking because that sounds like hes assuming he has a spot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i told him no but he doesnt wanna be rood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea ngl I wouldnt ask unless the offer was extended to me either
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^^^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Rooms tend to be like a tightly knit group who is comfortable around eachother and I dont like imposing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So I get why Tristan doesnt want to ask
Bill: Fair. But the fact that he’s not tight knit is like, why he doesn’t get an immediate assumption in.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but fillin katsu rooms is hard cause everyone has a friend group already
Bill: We stole Erik. Maaaaaybe Leanna. We also want less people tbh.
Bill: With Andrew Dave and Erik we’d be at what, 8? Ash or Kurtis or Anna or Tristan to wrap that up?
Bill: We should be able to make it work.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bill, Tom, Jess, Georgia, Marisa, Erik is 6
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Andrew, Dave, Ash is 9
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Kurtis or Anna or Tristan is 10
Bill: I think we’ll be fine for 9-10 easy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye, unfortunately I gotta room with my other friendos otherwise I would be that one filler for you xD ~~but katsu is the only time all year I get to see them so I cant bail~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye dats fair
Bill: Yup.
Bill: Completely understandable.
Bill: Mike and Monica’s son knows the organizer of Saikoucon.
Bill: He said the new location is worse than last year.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh yeah that guy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hes really nice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its a shame he dropped the ball on location
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yall wouldve loved the year it was at a waterpark resort
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it was like a CCE because we rented a whole villa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and it was a little more smol but that meant we could go back to the villa (with a steam room and a jacuzzi) and chill
Bill: Where’s the hotel. Friendcation.
Bill: I wanna do a weekend at CCE tbh, but they ridiculous expensive rooms off con.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Split Rock Resort
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it was like 60 per person for the weekend too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): granted we had like 8 in a house
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but it had three beds and a pull out couch
Bill: Let goooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@351785752197201920>
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg yes
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/groups/CosplayPhilly/permalink/272784366932853?sfns=mo
