Bill: Judging by Erik’s reaction, offering print service for my photos would be successful. Not a artist alley thing (probably), but by request it sounds neat.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): do it and also dress up as a witch
biru's print-on-demand service
Bill: Lol
Bill: That’s a stretch but funny.
Bill: Also no.
Bill: I gotta look into what the cost to print really is, just to recoup the cost with a charge.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ask for interesting things as payment. like a 5-leaf clover in a bottle of sand from a beach in florida, or the fur of at least 3 different mice
Bill: HAAHAHA that was the point behind the “eccentric tip jar” bit.
Bill: that never took off.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'll try to pay with a shark tooth in a denim sheath next time
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): bring tip jar back, new and improved
Bill: Nah.
Bill: I opened kofi. That was pointless.
Bill: Tho I opened it pretty late con season, so... maybe? Idk, it’s weird to think about getting money from friends and I only shoot friends these days.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that's capitalism baby!

Bill: Finally checked stories, looks like chaos.

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But he's def drunk
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): *present revoked*
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): nice tiny hat tom
Bill: Iiii thought it was coincidental, cadmiumcosplay was at the party? They followed me.
