Bill: all doable.
Bill: Any idea how late in the spring we need to be to get the waterfall flowing?

N🆗ri (Marisa): biru how much do I owe for Katsu car
Bill: I'll figure it out post Katsu, is fine. I don't know for sure yet.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Finished the gold part of the skirt. It looks absolutely atrocious and I’m really disappointed in myself but I’ll redo it after the con.
Bill: It okay to wait for Katarina.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Noooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s no other convention that’s good to wear her at
Bill: who says we need a con.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yes
N🆗ri (Marisa): Are you familiar with large skirts
Bill: No.
N🆗ri (Marisa): They large
N🆗ri (Marisa): Held up by stuff akin to hula hoops
N🆗ri (Marisa): Mines collapsible but I have to put it together when I put her on
N🆗ri (Marisa): Also very hard to bend over owo
N🆗ri (Marisa): And doorways awww yiss
N🆗ri (Marisa): You should wear one sometime I think it’d suit you
Bill: so? we bring it to place, you put on, boom.
N🆗ri (Marisa): えぇぇぇぇぇぇーー！？
N🆗ri (Marisa): what place possible for that
Bill: We'll find one!
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>

N🆗ri (Marisa): If not I begin plan B
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yes they look like dis
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I will iron them for you
N🆗ri (Marisa): I bless the rains down in Africa thank u 
BoJo said she might have something but it’s probably too big and not the right color
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg u need not exert urself by ironing I can do it at the con I’m already asking too much
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nah I'm about to iron Tom's Adam and Saeran stiff so it not biggy, the might need a touch up at the con but I'll get the big Bois out

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye boi
Bill: > Marisa before Katsucon: *I can't wait to room with all my Aurii friends*
> Marisa after Katsucon: *Can't room with aurii friends; they make me take care of myself*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am Afraid and so I will hide under furniture all the time probably
Bill: Cosplaying would be easier than the pre con "which clothes will make me not look like a creep most" closet search.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  the pants sent exactly dress pants but they aren't jeans either I tried to iron then like dress bands though
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess more like Wow Thanks I Owe You Forever
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No prob!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Do we have an official breakdown for rooms/beds?
Bill: Same as it was before. Aurii 6, Tristan Scott Anna and her bf in the other.
Bill: You sleep with Marisa.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Can I like... get ready in the other room?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause Scott and Tristan have simple cosplays
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And Pasquale isn’t cosplaying
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So there is Much Space for cosplaying up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): O wait so Marisa we share my air mattress then?
Bill: I could care less tbh. I just need marisa to know where she’s sleeping since she’s using your air mattress. She won’t say it, but her preference was known friendos before.
Bill: Steam roll into the other room, steal the bathroom, w/e.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah my only concern is space
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’ll keep props and bags in the other room then
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause I have a suitcase, an armor bag, beastlord, a backpack, and an air mattress SO
Bill: Let’s just hope for connecting. .
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Work that White Mom Complaining™️ skill
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bruh we have someone named Pasquale in our room and no one told me
That’s so rad
I assumed I was sleeping on the ground :0 anywhere fine
Imma need lots of space to put Katarina on or someone might get whiplash accidentally
Bill: I’ve only gotten connecting over the phone once.
Bill: *You are not sleeping on the goddamn ground*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I similarly need space for all the little Pyrrha pieces
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have 4 bags a giant hammer and spear
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Every day I thank gOD that I have a resilient back
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Otherwise cons would’ve murdered my spine
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Marisa we get to share my NASA blanket <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: One of these days Jess and Tom do need to take a turn on the floor.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Are u sayin we get a blanket too whaaaat
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone needs to introduce me to Pasquale because I’m already imagining calling them homie and telling people we’ve know each other since we were five
N🆗ri (Marisa): im bringin a cat doll that doubles as a pillow if i have room for it we can share it because i also have a star pillow that will match with the nasa theme
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I did the even know him
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We can rotate the air mattress if it's that big of a deal
N🆗ri (Marisa): am i gonna meet dave
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry, banana
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have scoliosis so after many nights on an air mattress my back hurts bad enough to ruin my time
Bill: If someone says something it’d be a nice gesture. But Marisa is well. Marisa, and Georgia said she’s fine so should be good. That said. What about Dave.
Bill: He’s still. Coming. Right?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh yea
N🆗ri (Marisa): i assumed when u said aurii 6 that's the 6th you meant
Bill: <@!228287793099440128> you gotta pay me at some point.
Bill: It is.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> o igotta do that too
Bill: He just said something like “I’ll pay you when we sure it’s not going to snow” and I’m like. Owo.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is swolfy going?
Bill: Nah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): rip
Bill: *You and Andrew can plan to visit and meet her*
N🆗ri (Marisa): is dave talkative irl because online he is a mystery
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LOL nah he pretty quiet
N🆗ri (Marisa): rip dave he gonna remain a mystery
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t necessarily mind sleeping on an air mattress cause I could sleep on a floor and get good sleep
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It’s just annoying hauling the big ass bag to carry it into the hotel
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Butttt thinking about it, I probably have to bring the air mattress even if I wasn’t sleepin on it cause the Garritys have a BIG one (too big for room?)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And bills are popped
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So I can bite the bullet but I’d appreciate help with getting all the shit inside 😓 I could carry everything in one go if it was just my cosplay but the air mattress potentially necessitates a second trip
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotchu i can carry
N🆗ri (Marisa): im like a camel
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Camel fursona Marisa owo
N🆗ri (Marisa): nO
N🆗ri (Marisa): dont say that i have to draw it but i do'nt have time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Georgia what time are you getting there 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): midnight ish right?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeaaaah I mean I’ll have Tristan
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hopefully he can do the help
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Highly relieved I can split parking with him now
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Noah’s a good egg but damn is it inconvenient to stay home late for Valentine’s
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Where does Tristan live?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Maryland, on the way basically
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’d drive by his house anyways
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OooOOo ok gotcha
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yes so by the time you get there we'll prob all be settled and could help you out with your stuff, I'm probably going to have to make 2 trips myself
Bill: Or someone can. You might be shooting.
Bill: When the hell are we eating Thursday.
N🆗ri (Marisa): haha
N🆗ri (Marisa): before u leave for the con
バナナ: i've awoken

Bill: Ye.

Bill: if you ever want to do something different just say so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just wrote yehaw
N🆗ri (Marisa): they probably charged me extra for that
