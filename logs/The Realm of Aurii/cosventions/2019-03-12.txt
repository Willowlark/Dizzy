N🆗ri (Marisa): strong
N🆗ri (Marisa): looks like a magical girl scepter in that pic
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Guess you can say ive been working out  💪 💪 💪 💪 💪
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I keep calling it a staff by accident
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So probably
N🆗ri (Marisa): we should give it a staff shirt
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I just got an email that due to people dropping out the security teams might be changed, so my zenkai schedule might change <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): NOOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hopefully that doesn’t happen but there’s a chance
N🆗ri (Marisa): I was looking forward to dealers 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): plz dont change mawisa schedule zenkaigods 🙏
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NOOOOO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Zenkai is canceled
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Go Holme folks
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pls come to con
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is not cancelled that is FALSE propaganda
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless they change your schedule so you have more time with us than it ok
Bill: *Marisa getting laid off con staffing would be great*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Naw that wouldn’t happen. Unless I get put on the night crew and work until 3am
N🆗ri (Marisa): NoooOooOo I need hotel and badge and food
N🆗ri (Marisa): Y’all’d get sick of me if I was around more often so staffing helps keep the moderation
Bill: I get sick of you not being around yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah behind around
N🆗ri (Marisa): I get to carry a radio <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m telling my radio
Bill: how much we love having you around?
Bill: Good idea.
N🆗ri (Marisa): About this fascist regime <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: It's in da rules, no being mean to Marisa.
Bill: Including you Marisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m gonna punch myself
N🆗ri (Marisa): For being a weeb
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ha HA
Bill: if you do I'll order you a pizza as a consolation.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mawisa no
Bill: comfort pizza.
N🆗ri (Marisa): NO I HAVENT BRUSHED MY HAIR IN SO LONG AND THERE IS NO FRIDGE ROOM
N🆗ri (Marisa): I haven’t finished that commission yet either because I can’t draw hands I’ve drawn like 5 hands every day and nothing works it’s cursed
Bill: then no punching yourself.
Bill: Only self hug.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m ace I’m not into those weird kinks
Bill: Reporter: "Do you bully people"
Me: "Oh, yes, all the time."
Reporter: "Strange of you to be so honest about it. What do you do?"
Me: "I make sure my friend eats and force them to acknowledge how loved they are"
Reporter: "uh?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had a dream I went to the movies with a bunch of people and I was left out in everything but I got some chips I was excited to eat and when I woke up I looked for the chips and realized they didn’t exist in reality <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bully Biru
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s your full legal name
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pls do not I can’t
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not again
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s no room I’d have to put it on the floor where Sylvia will eat it and barf again because she barfed four times yesterday
Bill: ooooh poor Sylvia. She okay?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I hope
Bill: V stuff is out for delivery.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Blake’s season one jacket thing goes really well with bee outfit
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Bee?
Bill: bee?
N🆗ri (Marisa): is beedoir not happening anymore
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can get a bee costume
Bill: beedoir is.
Bill: ~~I have no idea when but~~
Bill: We'll do it. 💪
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can get this
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes
Bill: so you mean you combining her weird tail coat thing with kitty lingerie?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *pffft*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah I can post a pic in nsfw
N🆗ri (Marisa): The giant fake chest really makes it
Bill: That sounds like I'm going to spit my drink out sitting it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Anti-alcohol measures in progress
Bill: Eiken boobs: anti drug.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We did it mr Obama we found the solution
Bill: I can kinda imagine how the outfit looks though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve forgotten how to put everything on that’s why it’s taking forever <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: lol
Bill: Zenkai does have the dancing lessons panel again and that I might consider.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof im struggling to find rhinestones that will work for raven for my forehead
N🆗ri (Marisa): would these work?
https://www.amazon.com/Nizi-Jewelry-Flatback-Rhinestones-Decorations/dp/B071GQ73LS/ref=sr_1_93?keywords=red+diamond+stone&qid=1552429092&s=gateway&sr=8-93
N🆗ri (Marisa): could resin cast it, would be nice and the perfect shape
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think i painted mine on. is it canonically a gem i thought it was like a tattoo
N🆗ri (Marisa): u right it's a gem i'm a fail
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah ive painted it on for casual but i figured id try the rhisestone
Aldus Larian (Jess): that might work if it will come in time, do u think that sparkly back will stick?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Fake fans
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo. If it doesn’t stick you can use spirit gum or latex
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea ill prob use spirt gum
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea those wont come in time 😦
Aldus Larian (Jess): theres these that arnt the most accurate but i guess i could still use it
https://www.amazon.com/Jyukan-Teardrop-Crystal-Rhinestone-Pointback/dp/B07C98L9YP/ref=sr_1_28_sspa?crid=2BLMJF4COQSOS&keywords=red+rhinestones&qid=1552428925&s=gateway&sprefix=red+rhin%2Caps%2C148&sr=8-28-spons&psc=1
Bill: *cardigan is not a good fit*
Bill: V wears it open but.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo i like it tho
Bill: Black jeans at least worked....
Bill: Low budget V.
Aldus Larian (Jess): aw man budget v, budget yoosung
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s V!
Bill: If it’s stretched a little bit out it looks okay, but it naturally bunches too short.
Bill: Maybe I could pin the bottom to the shirt so it stays a little longer.
Aldus Larian (Jess): id imagine finding men's long cardigans is hard
Bill: Finding men’s big cardigans you mean. Long too but that’s a bit easier.
Bill: That was the only one in a lot of searching.
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn, i think its fine tho
Bill: I’d say I’ll fit into it eventually but I dunno these days. Still, I don’t think I look terrible despite V being a twink.
Bill: Try it on again later before attempting to acquire wog.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE! looks good
Bill: ~~Fat~~ Husky V is a go a then... not going to do it without group tho, so depends if you doing MM at Katsu.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/b/bf/Jumin18.JPG
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/b/bf/Jumin18.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20181031060118
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wanna low key do seven but i did him at zenkai last year and i need a new wig but everytime i go to buy one i cant decide on a color
Aldus Larian (Jess): is that you yelling at biru to not degrade himself?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes and also if and when he does V, I can do Jumin again lolol
Bill: Not if I guess.
Aldus Larian (Jess): what your line up  erik?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also,did you mean Zenkai Bill?
Bill: Oh yeah shit lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh i just assumed he did XD
Bill: Zenkai.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): right now, Kirishima on Friday and Blake on Saturday are my only definites
Bill: Who cares if you did him last year, so what’s FUN
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Taiyang probably somewhere in there either Friday morning or Sunday
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im doing Raven and Casual Raven on Friday with georgia and 2b on saturday with tom but i could prob do saturday aftertoon/evening or sunday?
Bill: It’s up to you. Still gotta get a wig. You got the poppy one from Amazon right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): uhhh ebay i think? you can just borrow it if u want. its pretty roomy even if it is a little long for V
Aldus Larian (Jess): might be shorter on u
Bill: So that’d work. I’ll check after dinner.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): V's hair kind of fluctuates in length anyway, doesn't it?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea its long in another story and a lil shorter in main story
Aldus Larian (Jess): the color of my wig is technically a little too blue but 🤷
Bill: Beggars (me) aren’t choosers.
Aldus Larian (Jess): do u guys wanna do a sunday group? or sat evening? seven jumin and v is a pretty good combo
Bill: Sunday sounds gucchi.
Bill: It’ll be a repeat, since I gotta get my Marisa shoots in.
Bill: And she’ll be working boooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): repeat?
Aldus Larian (Jess): who else is doing v? 😮
Bill: I mean a repeat performance.
Bill: I’ll do V more than just once.
Bill: ~~I’m not a Marisa type~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooo ok u mean at another con or multiple times in teh weekend?
Bill: Another con probs. I’m technically a fake fan so I’d rather be in a group at all times XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea ill cover for u
Bill: ~~No one cares about V tho so I won’t get caught~~
Bill: 😛
Bill: Also cosplay only seems fun to me in a group.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its much more fun for sure
Bill: So expect me to only be involved if there’s a group.
Bill: Hazel is not coming in time, for sure. So I can sync with RWBY by Next maybe.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if you do more obscure characters, then definitely more fun as a group. Like, I wouldn't do Jumin outside a group either because he's not *that* recognizable
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but if you're doing a good stand-alone character sometimes it's neat going on your own
Aldus Larian (Jess): mood
Bill: I’m low key curious about Mirio but also not having the big three would be sad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!301927856240459777> <@!351785752197201920>  or <@!245270932602486784>  are welcome to join us too if u want some comfy sunday cosplay
Bill: *The return of budget Yoosung*
Aldus Larian (Jess): i might be able to do nejire int he afternoon on Saturday after 2b?
Aldus Larian (Jess): toms only seems to have one solid plan so far
Bill: Nah, we can do it at another con.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Mystic Mess sun? :0
I was gonna do pokeymans but I can switch to Jaehee. I don’t think I can do ray while working and I haven’t remade the jacket yet. Or I can do Mc if no one else does her
Aldus Larian (Jess): im not sure when u are working exactly. i dont wanna inconvinece you i just wanted to let you know u are welcome
Bill: Do what you wanna do. I’d like to do it again and get a ~~better~~ another shoot for it, Rebecca with her new camera, Mawisa, David... but that can be whenever.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ray would be a pain to do while working
N🆗ri (Marisa): sunday i'm scheduled from 9am to 6pm currently. assuming i don't change teams i'll be working as long as the dealers is open but I miiiight be able to get an hour break at some point.
ray is fine to wear while working but i need the back of my shirt visible at all times while staffing
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh i wouldn't worry about it then, do jaehee if anything cuz idk how long we will be there sunday
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Plus if u wanna cosplay ray again I wanna be your MC and show off with u cuz u look really cute as him~~
Bill: But you could be sis...broth...ers.
Aldus Larian (Jess): truuuuueee
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wanna do mc too but i wanna cosplay seven before it gets to warm for him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was gonna do Yona but I do feel kinda sad without Marisa to Yona with me so it might be better to save Yona for another con...
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***y o n a***
yona when then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yona for private shoot before I leave to physics land in the summer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or August when I come back
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~if we do yona at another con i can join up as shin-ah?~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or if I can go to Anext/Otakon

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Friday depending on if I get days off
N🆗ri (Marisa): this could be us
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Marisa could be the bitch boi
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~gobi?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I should probably get a wig for Jumin for when I ultimately have to get my hair cut
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~Erik would be a good jae-ha~~
Bill: Marisa gets dibs on character cause she the true Yona fan.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my bangs are currently mc length but i was gonna cut them before the con and I can gouge out my eyes
N🆗ri (Marisa): we all yona fans

N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): it look like a robe but that's just a shirt

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 8 pm Saturday
Bill: I just don’t want all of BNE at the thing.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Huzzah
N🆗ri (Marisa): o the chilis is far, i would be able to attend at that time but i wouldn't be able to go there sorry
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So me, Bill, Tom, Jess, Marisa, Leanna, Erik, possible Justin
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Marisa it ok we uber

N🆗ri (Marisa): how many people can fit in one uber
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Justin also potentially leaving around that time and him have at least the drive there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): At least 3
N🆗ri (Marisa): clown uber! clown uber!
Bill: Kurtis will come too I assume.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sunday I wanna leave at 3 cause back to campus so I wouldn’t be able to dinner
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): +Kurto
Bill: We can do late lunch instead.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how long will chilis take because i can wait for everyone to finish dinner
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~idk if me and tom going to chilis or not yet~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess, but dinner Saturday is also me forcing myself to eat a substantial meal at least halfway through the weekend
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Zenkai is a clusterfuck of planning omg
Bill: Tru and the hotel restaurant a crap shoot now.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why did they make it so close to Katsu
Bill: Spring break.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the way it's running this year is a mess, 90% of staff don't even have their schedules yet
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): if no one goes to chilis they can lurk with me
Bill: Saturday night also have rave and ghillies.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe we’re better being local then...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tho then we fight the crowd, and for me, the age cutoff
Bill: Let’s talk about it like tomorrow.
Bill: Too much going on at once.
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you also still on the yona stuff
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> ~~the more last minute the planning gets the less likely I am to commit to other people’s schedules~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i prob wont make any foosd plans till we are there
N🆗ri (Marisa): i won't buy any food but i can loiter
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I don’t follow Georgia.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont really plan food ahead of time  
~~im just trying to tie down a lineup first~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought we talked about chilis weeks ago and it was a solid plan?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i thought the plan then was to eat in the lobby but that's out now
Bill: It is right now.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you did in BNE but i didnt say anything cuz i know tom isnt big on chillis (i think?)
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nuh not in BNE cause it would’ve been too large of a party
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BNE talked about the kigu party with pizza and we were like “eh”
N🆗ri (Marisa): i remember the chilis dinner discussion starting in bne but i don't recall anything afterwards
