N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia ur face has some dirt on it do u want me to shop that off <:lenny:395307171539189760>

is it just me or is this image really dark
stuff that looks fine on my computer screen looks dark on my phone screen
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Na fam
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is your brightness down?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it's always at like 2%
N🆗ri (Marisa): that couldn't possibly have any effect could it
Bill: oof price but. That's a useful topic and I've met him before, he's pretty good.
Bill: Those who use photoshop more than me, is the blue sky shopped in Hunter's photos?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t think so, the sky looked like that Friday morning. If it was after Friday tho probably shopped
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont think so
Bill: Bees was saturday.
Bill: I can say from my Nier stuff sky's blew out pretty easily saturday. It's hard to get that blue sky look out of camera so I'm curious.
Bill: Or I just. Don't know how to do it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just ask
Bill: I feel like 'is that shopped' would come off poorly.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "how did you get the sky so blue like that, it looks really nice." or seomthing
Bill: oof but the compliment.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~I kept the question out of bn-tea for a reason, I just wanted to know the technique~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so you think it looks bad?
Bill: It's not that it's good or bad. I'm just noting how that look came from the same weather I was shooting in.
Bill: I know Hunter shops, so I was curious if that was the cause or something else.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was prob just earlier in the day, or her upped the saturation on it
N🆗ri (Marisa): that picture of georgia i posted yesterday is from saturday morning and has some blue. could be from earlier in the day because it's nowhere near the same amount of blue but it's there. didn't he say he woke up for a shoot at 8am or somethin
Bill: Possibly. I'd say something, but I don't have my images to compare to at Armonk (left my tablet at home and don't carry the hard drive anymore) so I can't really compare. I'll ask later.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Compliments get you far
Dirty Lego (Tom): Even fake ones
Dirty Lego (Tom): 🙏
Bill: You are 100% correct that's how I got the card of a gaylord manager.
Bill: Bees was midday, they were in that before Nier.
Bill: I'm seeing if lightroom classic will download the smart previews from the cloud my tablet uses. If I get really curious I could just use lightroom CC too.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I think he shops or really plays with colors
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That Yang photo in the woods was not as vibrant green as the photos makes it seem
Bill: Mm.
Bill: Y’all see them? Tis amazing.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I didn't but that's neet
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow tom and jess look great
Bill: Right?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): babe i sent that too you yesterday 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not this exact pic, another one
Bill: *I am the ~~captain~~ babe now*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess):

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wut?
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru wants a lewd shoot with tom
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do u upload stuff to google drive without it crashing aaaaaaa
Bill: Get Dropbox.
N🆗ri (Marisa): mine are all full
Bill: Oof.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah I remember this now
Dirty Lego (Tom): I just didn't know it was the same
N🆗ri (Marisa): my flickr, dropbox, and most of my google drive account are full. i know this one isn't though unless i somehow filled up 68% with just pictures of tom and jess from katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): dropboxes. i have like 4.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're very important images
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): extemly
