NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): cosplay horror stories
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): wait i have 4 days of manga to catch up on
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): what first
Aldus Larian (Jess): horror stories horror stories
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): truu
sorry i was discussing moving to animenext staff with someone because they had to hire interpreters but they'd rather have free volunteers
but animenext's staff sounds like a mess too, but being an interpreter is more prestigious and i might not be treated like a low-tier laborer like at zenkai
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): lemme see if i can find a video
Bill: Hunter will probably help you out. Youâ€™ll have to ride with his casual attitude towards things though.
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): what do u mean how would he help me out
Bill: But *yeaaaaah* Next is a mess too.
Bill: If you told him you were thinking about staffing heâ€™d introduce you to people and stuff?
Bill: I mean you know a lot of people too.
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): i already know people
the board of directors at animenext personally asked me to help staff this year but i declined
Bill: Girl you gotta stop downplaying how famoose you are.
Bill: Thatâ€™s so cool.
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): the people forget about me easily i think
i'm not fame
Bill: Marisa is cool.
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): no u
Aldus Larian (Jess): she does necessarily downplay it just doent feel the need to discuss it or take advantage
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): i gotta repent for cutting the pre-reg line on thursday that's tearing me up inside
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): i saw a lot of people from zenkaikon who i've directly worked with. some of them remember me (jim, penny, kiwi, dan), a lot didn't and didn't recognize me (nai, lizzy, wheezey)
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): and by "directly work with" i mean "spent a whole weekend working side by side for 8 hours a day"
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): thurs-sun
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): SO in 2013 or 2014, I can't remember but around then, Panty & Stocking was at the height of popularity. There were these two girls who decided to enter the masquerade as Panty and Stocking doing a really cute tango-like dance routine. They practiced for weeks/months and had their routine down perfectly. Outfits were on point, everything was great.
They go up on stage to do their skit and at one point they have to dip each other. Panty dips stocking, great! Stocking dips panty. Her wig falls off despite the ton of bobby pins. They had practiced with the wigs before but I guess they were nervous and sweatier than usual and the sweat made all the bobby pins null. So they finished the dance without the wig (just in a wig cap) and they've never been able to live it down.

I saw that happen live and I still feel so bad for them.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO D:
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): Another story:
Girl is cosplaying Wolfwood from Trigun. He has a giant cross, I'll go find a pic
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): leik dis
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): so she wants to make the cross! yeah! it's a big part of identifying his character. She first tries to make it out of wood or such, but it's super heavy and that won't work all day at a con. So she makes it a second time out of foam, but it's also not working. Too unstable. She gets fed up and makes a third one out of cardboard and wraps it in fabric. It's flimsy but it works.

Goes to pack the car and head down to Otakon (~6 hour drive she said). Cross won't fit in her car. SO
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): she ties the cross to the roof of the car
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): gets in and starts driving down
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oh no that masquerade story is sad ðŸ˜¢ but was the dance good?
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Maybe they save face
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): YEAH they were really good!!! the dance was cute
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): but so many people saw it and there are so many pictures rip
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): That's awesome tho, the wig thing sucks but I'm sure thier performance more than made up for it
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): Cross girl: Everything goes fine and well and dandy! They make it down to Baltimore with no issues. Until they're 10 minutes from the con and the sky opens up and it starts to downpour. They rush as fast as possible to find a parking garage by the hotel that has a roof. They get there and get out of the car, the cross is basically deflated and hugging the roof of the car. <:rip:369476083248267274>
They rush to the hotel and check in and ask for 2 extra hair dryers to try and revive it. Next day at the con, it's ok! She gets stopped about 3 times for pictures and after the 3rd time, the arms on the cross floop down like they've deflated and she had to toss it. Sad!
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO! ðŸ˜­
Andrew: Rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats so sad
Andrew: At least she got the few picstures
Andrew: rather than it dying en route
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): Similar story:
I forget what costume this guy said he was doing, but it was red. All red armor or such. Spent a ton of money and months working on it.
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): It was his child. Pride and Joy.
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: oh no
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): Him and his friends start gearing up to go to the con, pack the car and start to head down. He had put the box in the driveway for the friend to load up as he was bringing out more luggage. As they were driving down, he glanced in the back and noticed the box wasn't there. So he goes, "hey, did we remember to load [the costume]?" Everyone else in the car goes, "oh, no? Probably not whoops," including the guy who was supposed to load the box.

Turns out, as he silently denied loading the box, he didn't mention that he had forgotten the box on the roof of the car. At this point they were on a major interstate highway. Driver makes a U-turn and begins to head back, hoping maybe the box is still in the driveway. As they drive they begin seeing little bits of red foam and fabric on the road. <:hmm:543194383885926403>
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): rest in pieces
Andrew: big RIP
Andrew: im imagining that happen to all my armor sets
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG NOOOOOOOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): AGHHH
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): The beowolf cosplayer from last year?/two years ago? was telling the story of his stilts and how he smashed up his face and scraped up his legs because he didn't make the stilts properly
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oh noeeeee
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): Also, remember that insulation foam melts when spray painted, as one girl found out the hard way after 2 weeks of hand carving and sanding a gorgeous keyblade, only to have it disintegrate in front of her eyes as she went to paint it <:rip:369476083248267274>
Andrew: oh god
Andrew: thats horrible
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): omg there was a story about EMCP!! The creepy photog i worked with!
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): That happened to <@228287793099440128>
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): With his poor shield
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): OH NOO
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): EMCP invited two cosplayers to a photoshoot at his new york apartment, on the same day his roommate was having a bunch of models over for a photoshoot. He leaves the cosplayers on their own for a bit saying "you can network with the models!" Cosplayers, being antisocial nerds, were kind of hesitant. There was a food table set up in a corner so the one girl went over and picked up a reeses cup. Eugene sees her and goes "oh, that's not model food. That's for the photographers, you shouldn't be eating that stuff. We have salad over there" or something like that. The cosplayer looked him dead in the eyes and ate the chocolate in one bite.
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): omg andru 128mb this file is huge
Bill: *give them to Ray*
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): the file? :0
Andrew: is it one of the vids?
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): the folder itself but u right the videos are probably what makes it big
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTF?!
Bill: Marisa told me this story while eating a Reeseâ€™s.
Andrew: had to act it out
Bill: *I think she was sending me a message*
Bill: :3
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _good morning world con fatigue made me sleep til noon_
Andrew: my legs arent working so i can feel that

Andrew: yes i know! isnt it grand?
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): at least three grand
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Woah!
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): We had one we were given but the timing was way way off for the bobbin sooo
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): We threw it out and got a new one oops
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my mom got mad at me for buying one when she had an extra machine her mom got her for her wedding that she never uses lol
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): collect them all
Andrew: now just to learn how to use it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My mom cleaned out her closet and now I got two free pairs of boots YEET
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): omg i think there are two versions of the left brain right brain song with super subtle differences
the version i'm using isn't matching up to jess in certain parts i gotta find the one she used
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): ok i think i found it
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): it doesn't have the full opening spiel though
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): they're so similar but just different enough to mess up the timing of the video aaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo no mines the one on Spotify that all I know
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's like the album version? I think?
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): we're missing literally the last like 5 seconds where they combined together haha rip
where should i cut it off? before juggling?
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): breaking down sobbing?
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): wait no omg we need "no you're not" in there
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): i'll put it up to "we can do comedy" for now
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea we def need no your not
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe "take the best part of both of us, put em together"
NðŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): ooo that's a good part
it's already rendering oops but if you don't like it i can go back and cut it there, that's probably a better idea because the current end is cringy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Okey dokey
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!334090409389195266> <@!386874959009415170> any preference for which day we do mini gendervengers squad at Otakon?

Nokri (Fopdoodle): is it out of sync? i tried to match it as best I could but i didn't check it after uploading it oops
Nokri (Fopdoodle): the beginning segment was really out of sync so i cut it entirely
Nokri (Fopdoodle): because of the differences in versions ahhh
Nokri (Fopdoodle): it seeeeems in sync to me i think
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe uploading it did something?
Nokri (Fopdoodle): is the music too fast or too slow?
