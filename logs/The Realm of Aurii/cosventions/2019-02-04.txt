Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hopefully when I dirty beastlord up and put the handle on I’ll feel better
N🆗ri (Marisa): it sounds like you're doing a lewd version of it
Bill: You are rather distracted with everything at school. I’d focus on finishing A2. You have your debut outfit, you’ll run around Friday doing Pyrrha like you love, and Sunday lazy anyway.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tru and I’ve been psyched about A2 for a while
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I think I’m gonna try to dirty the jumpsuit next weekend
Bill: Prioritize your work left to do. That’s what I’d do.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Well it would take like 30 mins to weather
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hopefully I can see A2 stuff at school
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I added the caps pouch at least, which is cool
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Bill: I suppose. Nice. Belts really got a lot on it.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah i wanted to have as many fallout easter eggs on it lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i looked up other fallout cosplays to maybe get inspired to add anything else
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think im good with what i have, plus some suit weathering
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): most female fallout cosplay seems to be the "half zipped suit" picture or the butt pic
Bill: Well vault suits are pretty boring.
Bill: I’m not surprised
Bill: Just move onto armor if you want new fallout projects.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): POWER ARMOR YEAH
Bill: That.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah i wanna do that pretty bad
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats a humongous project
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): id probably also want to make the clean vault suit to wear under that
Bill: Sure.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Feel like I got nighting done today... I tried to remake Nora's shirt but just ended up fucking it up up and getting frustrated at giving up, I repainted magnhild but I cant seal it cuz I've gotta wait for the new sealent I wanna try to come in the mail. I made my ears for mononoke but I can attach them because I have to wait for velcro to come in 😔
Bill: That’s still a lot of work.
Bill: It just sucks when you don’t get to complete anything, only make progress.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea esspecialy cuz I have no full work days left.
Bill: This...
Bill: then this for the back...
Bill: I have other good images I could showcase for the back, but I really hate collage looks and that photo is my most liked on instagram.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Front looks good! Your logo isnt centered though, not sure if intensional or not, but do to size it would recommend centering it. On the back I would suggest carrying over some black element to tie the design together
Bill: Vistaprint doesn't let me center it... ^^;;
Bill: I'm not the best at eyeballing it.
Bill: I was going to put a black box with more contact info, but there's no where to really do so without blocking a face...
Bill: I could use a darker image like Dan's Fjord?
Bill: though that image has the dead space for a textbox in the first place.
Bill: I'm still partial to something more minimal, like the circle part of the design being the core of it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): bring it over some like to about here if you want it centered
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what other info did you want to put on it?
Bill: OH I can't do that. The circle itself is part of the pre defined template.
Bill: That and the black bar are preset.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OHHH
Bill: Other social media, but tbh instagram and the website is all I need. website has everything else.
Bill: Yeah this isn't an Original Graphic Design ™
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye... hmm that does limit you quite a bit
Bill: 
Bill: I'mma just print that on cards.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): there ya gp
Bill: Yeah I still want to do a design like yours. I like the circle thing, that looks really cool, so I just want a simple background behind that and boom.
Bill: I have... mild reservations about having Georgia front and center on the card too... While it's a perfect shot for a business card, I don't want to be the guy whose like 'here's my card, oh look there's instagram famous wezrez' like the dude at Otakon who did that with Mangoloo... Or be defined by her forever, much like Jake is for Casey.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it probably best to feature 2 pics? seeing as its for photography. i liked using Moo cuz you could pick up to 50 different back designs so i featured 5 different cosplays
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it's common to have a bunch of different designs. people will even let you choose what design/picture you want on their card when giving it out at events to remember them better.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what about something like dis?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): maybe one guy, one girl? or one solo, one group?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Critical role is popular now so that’s also good
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yee!
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'd love to catch up on critical role but
Dirty Lego (Tom): So long aghhh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Bill: OOH that cool.
Bill: You know what might be cool with that?
Bill: Using the RWBY and JNPR “on the floor” photos.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i had thought about that, but due to she square nature of them i think you could only do it on the back side, the front would have enough room with the logo
Bill: Ahhh. Rip.
Bill: Gimme a half hour, I gotta subway.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Extra pickles
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this one of gen is good too cuz there is space for a infos
https://www.flickr.com/photos/thelittlethingswemiss/42776480692/
N🆗ri (Marisa): We should take pictures for business cards. Like purposefully pose them to have room and stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do them all like this:
N🆗ri (Marisa): THATS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): I made u a card
Bill: Mmkay.
Bill: I think the two you picked are better than the one with Gen, cause darker schemes suit me.
Bill: Nier has more black and white ascethic too.
Bill: is that a photoshop or moo?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): illustrator
Bill: oooh fancy.
Bill: I have no idea how to use that.
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it wont matter ill just give you pdfs
Bill: I don't think I really need the box on either side... The name is in the logo, and if I can do the curved thing for the website and instagram that'll be enough for info.
Bill: If I *really* needed more information, I could put it on the ribbon without it looking terrible right?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do u have a higher rez logo?
Bill: 
Bill: Are the photos high enough res? I assumed the web resolution would be too small, and my hard drive is at home.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they are like 240 when you download them which is what i did
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): BCs are small
Bill: 240 pixels?
Bill: that's weird. they should be 1000 pixels longest edge.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): PPI
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): pixels per inch
Bill: oooh. Yeah, I don't play with that output.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i think they will be fine
Bill: Does illustrator have layers?
Bill: ~~ignore how dumb that question sounds~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont use them alot but yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what font was used for the insta and website on vista?
Bill: If they're on their own layer I could put the full size image export behind the ribbons later.
Bill: "Adelle"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if you want, i still had to shirk the photos after putting them in illustrator for them to fit on the card meaning the ppi would be 300+ by the time it was card sized 300 is print standard.
Bill: Oh wow.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Adelle is an adobe font of course
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im just going to have to fins something close enough
Bill: I hold no attachment to the font.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do you want the ribbon off the front?
Bill: what you mean?
Bill: like it's only on one side?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you said something about not needing it?
Bill: nah, not needing a floating box for more info.
Bill: I love the ribbon on each side.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooooo ok
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Bill: Is the screen cap just low res or did the logo not resize well?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): screen cap
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hmm... maybe you do wanna put the images in yorself to be safe...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): which makes me worry for mine but rip too late now
Bill: You might be able to cancel it and I can get you the high res.
Bill: Assuming you used my photos.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nope i had to make any changes within 3 hrs
Bill: rather than changes cancel the order?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): idk... i mean they ll probably look ok just not the best
Bill: Could you make the logo on the bigger ribbon bigger? I think the text on top makes it look smol.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Moo cards usually look really nice I’ve used them before
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess you used moon right
Bill: Not the print, it's the image quality provided to them we're talking about.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i could have sworn the images were high enough rez but maybe im fukcing it up with rebeccas pics
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah but unless it’s super pixelated it won’t be too noticeable
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thave allready been printed so too late
Bill: I have a standard export, I dunno what she does.
N🆗ri (Marisa): People won’t be scrutinizing every little detail of your cards
Bill: ~~I was looking at the big 3, her post processing confuses me greatly~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Rebecca’s? I was curious about that too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like that?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): idk she dropboxed me them so they were full rez. im just stupid and wasnt thinking
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~this is why i shouldnt do things in a rush~~
Bill: Even bigger was what I was thinking. The top text stands out more than the symbol. ~~I know it probably should as my handle but the symbol so pretty and *me*~~
Bill: What photos did you use?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wait
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do you want your logo bigger, the ribbon bigger, or the while thing bigger?
N🆗ri (Marisa): How often do y’all hand out cards at conventions? I’ve given out like 10 in 5 years in the US
Bill: The logo bigger, and the top text smaller, closer to the bottom text in size.
Bill: So that in the ribbon circle the logo is the most prominent part.
Bill: I give them out whenever I do hall shots (never these days) or when I shoot with new people like we did at Kotoricon.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah that happened
Bill: YE LIKE THAT.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i printed the proof at work just now it looks fine, maybe not the best but i think its doable
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it would however be easier for you to send me these 2 than for me to try to export this in a way that would be editable by you
Bill: Sure. It’ll be tonight tho. Haven’t been traveling with my hard drive.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): okey dokey
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): leave your watermark off for those since your logo is allready on it
Bill: Would an extra space at the end of the top line balance the text more?
Bill: Or would that make it look weird?
Bill: Will do, I have watermarkless export configured.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): does it look unbalenced?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it looks balanced to me but ive been staring at it
Bill: I think it’s balanced, but the all caps on the end makes it look bigger? I could easily be crazy tho.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea cuz they are caps
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): kinda just the nature of the beast, i could make them "small caps" or size the font down on just your handle
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): on the other hand you kins want it to stick ouy
Bill: Hmm.
Bill: Could you use a symbol like that instead of the word Instagram? Then TLT_WM will be more centered.
Bill: Or would that be too hard?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hard no but since its a circle within a circle isk how it would look
Bill: I had googled “black and white instagram logo” and there were a few others that might work.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Careful with logos, vistaprint cancelled my order a while back because it had an insta logo on it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its more the idea of chape inside of shape with a logo that gets too busy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea if the logos dont follow the brand guidelines they are technically "illegal use"
Bill: aaah... Think I could get away without the "Instagram: " part?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo i thought thats what you meant in the first place opps
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you know what hold on
Bill: Well, the symbol replacement was the first idea. I think skipping the colon would maybe be better ~~but also every time I suggest something I think I'm making it worse so~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what about that?
Bill: It looks so good there! Think moving the website would be a good idea too then?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): since the website is so long i kinda like it where it is the insta handle is short and sweet
Bill: Yeah. This might super unbalance the ribbon, but what if there was QR code under the handle?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oof i hate qr codes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~fucking eyesores~~
Bill: I suppose they are lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i personally feel like no one uses them? but if you want it we could prob fit it in
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well have to move up the position of the circle though
Bill: I wouldn't want to do that ye... And you right, I don't think most people know how to read a QR.
Bill: I really like it. Part of me is a bit worried the url looks a little funny down there, but I like it too much to come up with an alternate.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): your site?
Bill: yeah.
Bill: It's growing on me too fast tho.
Bill: I like.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Bill: ah yuck yuck yuck.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lol
Bill: That looks like something I would make.
Bill: Yeah definitely as it just was.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~well it was your idea~~
Bill: ~~you gotta start tellin me no when appropriate~~
Bill: 😛
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i did tell you, i just wanted to *show* you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if its not a hard change to make ill show the person so they can actually see wha ti mean
Bill: yes you've made me realize just how much I like what I was hesitant about.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): on the back i just did your logo since there is no reason to repeat the site or handle but it will still tie it together with the front
Bill: Could put twitter down like instagram is on there, but *shrug*. I don't actively use it, it just gets reposts. Other social media has too long usernames.
Bill: YEAH I like the back. Did you scale that logo up a bit too?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea since there were no other elements to fit in
Bill: perfection.
Bill: I need to ask Dan if he's cool with me using the image tho.
Bill: ~~technically I might not have to, photo rights question, but may as well~~
Bill: Doubt he'll say no.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea just check in
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so front:
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and back:
N🆗ri (Marisa): Meg is using a pic I took of her on her Katsu business cards and I’m excited to see them but I have no idea what pic she’s using I can’t even fathom what it would be
N🆗ri (Marisa): Utena probably?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo neato!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its actually a pic of your cat
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): After double checking it can’t be utena because all the shots I got were awful
Bill: Love em.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🇾 🇦
N🆗ri (Marisa): Why and how her face blurry
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🇳 🇴 🇵 🇪
Bill: Do you still have the template for the back with the ribbon going long wise?
Bill: If I did a second design I’d love to use that one.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah bit i can do it really easily
Bill: Maybe one of the laying down team photos (I’ve decided I need to get one of that shot with SSSN), and something else RWBY since I’m usually a RWBY photographer guy.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yeet
Bill: Dans cool with it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sweet
N🆗ri (Marisa): Holy guacamole this wig is so fluffy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): whomst
N🆗ri (Marisa): Emma
I gotta style it but it’s already pretty passable
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NICE
N🆗ri (Marisa): now I feel like an adult cosplaying a child hhhh I gotta de-age
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): And take the top in a few inches on the bottom
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): a baby
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s what I must become
N🆗ri (Marisa): Time to test the wig I found and see if it works for jaehee or if I need a new one
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oof. I can’t tell. It’s the right length but something is off.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I feel like I’m going to work at 7am I hate this costume lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): dont wear it then silly!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wear things you like ✨
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nononono I like jaehee I’m just using my old uniform as her costume so my brain is like “time 4 work”
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk. The front would need styling but the whole thing looks strange to me. Do you think this wig would work
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ll wear my other glasses for the costume
Bill: Cute
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think it works
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah BoJo found that cute dress in the back in the shed
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like my san wig is too short but i dont wanna get another
N🆗ri (Marisa): Could lend you my San wig but it’s a mess and also pretty short
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think itll be ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe this one is too dark for jaehee? Maybe that’s it? I’ll toss it in a pile of talcum powder
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IT FINE
N🆗ri (Marisa): *but is t really*
N🆗ri (Marisa): I was petting my cat and then stopped because cat hair on the suit but it’s jaehee so bring it on
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its in character 🆗
N🆗ri (Marisa): It feels more like an Akane cosplay someone give me a gun
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think gen (evie) has one! XD
Bill: Dis one for the long side small ribbon then... Something on the other side.
Bill: I just really like that one.
Bill: Maybe chatterbox on the other side.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): are you gonna order 2 complete different sets?
N🆗ri (Marisa): [points] das me
Bill: I shouldn't really. I don't give them out enough.
Bill: This flipped?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): moo lets you do different backs but the fronts have to be the same
Bill: Oh that's interesting.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just put the circle and stuff on the otherside, you dont want all those words backwards
Bill: Yeah, that'd be better.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah backwards words would be wonky
N🆗ri (Marisa): Put the circle on our faces so it’s like a head with four bodies
N🆗ri (Marisa): Graphic design is my passion
Bill: I guess I could do a bunch of different backs, but there's nothing I really feel should be consistent across all of them?
Bill: Like, if I do a bunch of different backs but Dan's on the front of all of them it'd be weird.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): all the backs?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the black band and circle will tie them all together regardless of orientation the element is the same
Bill: Right, but like... 
Dan - Georgia
Dan - Tom/Jess
Dan - RWBY group
Dan - SSSN group

Suddenly it looks like I REALLY like Dan.
Bill: If I were to do one image consistent across all of them it'd have to be pretty special. ~~probably a location shoot with Georgia~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if you want different fronts and back you'll need completely different sets moos minimum is 50 idk about vista
Bill: I'll go to Moo... and lets just do 50. You know what I could do in that scenario?
Bill: If *I* get photos, I could put me consistently on the front and vary the backs with my own work.
Bill: Although that could be kinda misleading, maybe not.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you could so a front with no image but you'll need a whole design tweek. if you wouldn't feel weird about have 50 of Georgias face then you shouldnt feel weird about dan either
Bill: No, that would be weird too.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): maybe just center the ribbon over more of a background looking photo?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but if u wanna feature cosplay on both sides its gonna be 50 of someone
Bill: Eh. Nah. If anything I'd ask for a second pair, with RWBY shots in it. Then print the two, and if I actually give all of those out, I'll consider doing more variety.
Bill: A group consistent across all the cards might be less weird, but I find solo shoots look better.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i got 50 with 5 different backs
Bill: Like, I want variety, but whose going to know I have a variety? Just me really.
Bill: I only give one card to a person
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea exactly
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so just get one set for now, when those get low, pic two new ones
Bill: mm. Plus I think I was just *better* at Kotori shooting; if that carries over Katsu photos might turn out to be great card fodder.
Bill: ~~It's the old collectable card games mentality doing it to me~~
Bill: Plus location shoots in the works, Color Factory, Buttermilk.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i hope i remeber to give them out more this time XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): although sometimes if i think the person is weird i specifically say i dont have a card opps
Bill: Justified.
Bill: For consistency I should do two normal photos with the ribbon design, but lol I give out my card to non cosplayers like once a year.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just print those at home
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): theres no point getting like 50 for 1 a year
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im just gonna drop my cards on the tables and hope people follow me
Bill: buying cardstock can't be that hard either.
Bill: Though double sided printing scares me.
Bill: I've left my cards at those little 'local business bulletin boards' in some shops.
Bill: Like at the car wash and bagel shop.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i can do them for you if you want 10 fit on a page and the worst thing that happens if you reprint it and wast 1 sheet
N🆗ri (Marisa): The random table idea sounds unsafe
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s what I was worried people would do with the stickers and then weird people would find them
Bill: Is fine if there's nothing more personal than an instagram on it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): doxxed
Bill: There was someone awhile back, not for cosplay, that did like... business card dungeon pieces that you could fit together to make a dungeon map.
Bill: I loved that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 💸
Bill: mm.
Bill: Probably printed it themselves though.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): depending on their resources  it may be
Bill: ye. I love easter eggs in cards like that.
Bill: No ideas for photography card easter eggs though.
Bill: I've given up on it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Scratch and photo reveal
Bill: ~~satisfies the urge for variety by pushing BNE trading cards~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Go recommend that
We can make online trading cards to start and then move to real world 
There can be a bot for that, some servers I’m in have level systems and virtual shops
Bill: I can picture it my head like, we just need the template for the front.
Bill: A border, in the same color as the flag, that's got like a spot for name at the top, and in the bottom 1/4 or 1/3 of the image is a translucent open "scroll" where we put text in. The back is just the flag symbol.
Bill: We just need that, and we scan slide in new images under the template easy peasy.
Bill: Maybe a spot on the bottom side, for handle.
Bill: 
Bill: ~~call me chinese knock off Jess~~
Bill: https://twitter.com/ri_care/status/1091074975606263808 oof NICE.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve been trying to dislodge this piece for 3 hours and it just flew across the room wew that could’ve been deadly
