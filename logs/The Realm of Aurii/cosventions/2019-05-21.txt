Nokri (Marisa): Now you know why people don‚Äôt easily get into critical role or the adventure zone <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _not worth the cute accent_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's easy to get into when you only have a part time job and only a few classes <:pew:543202259085950996>

Aldus Larian (Jess): Me in college: I wish i could have a birthday party but i dont have enough friends
Me now: AHHHHHH
Bill: Ahahaha
Aldus Larian (Jess): trying to figure out how many people to invite
Bill: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have 22 rn
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: Always assume at least a third won't make it cause flake/happenstance/etc.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Aldus Larian (Jess): if i take the PA girsl and anna out thats 17
Aldus Larian (Jess): not sure weather to invite them or not
Bill: mm.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~does anyone have opinions?~~
Bill: On inviting them?
Bill: ~~I always have opinions~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think i had 19 people last year so it will prob end up about the same
Bill: Um... ~~eats own words~~
Bill: I do like Anna, I can say that... The PA girls kinda exist. I wouldn't stress anyone from that group besides Rebecca and Monica though, the rest are too unreliable.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im not stressin
Bill: I mean like, don't bother with inviting.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): should only invite people you definitely want to hang out with too
Aldus Larian (Jess): if i invite Monica and Rebecca ill prob invite Jamie and heather too
Bill: Though I'll say I liked your party last year cause it... wasn't predominantly male, like everything I've ever held so. PA girls helped that along.
Bill: Yeah those were the two who are unreliable.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have 8 bois
Bill: üëç
Bill: But Leanna basically sums it up... if you want to see them, invite them, if you feel obligated, don't.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats my problem i like alot of people XD
Bill: Lol. More than 20 will get unruly though.
Bill: Is it just the weeb friends or you inviting normies too?
Aldus Larian (Jess): 22 is fine, some people wont be able to come
Aldus Larian (Jess): normies too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Aldus Larian (Jess): sorry guys
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): normies are good to bring the weebs back to reality
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): all normies should be required to wear "anime was a mistake" shirts
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): just as a reminder
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~they usssually dont come anyway~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üò≠
Aldus Larian (Jess): out of my 3 id prob count on aliza the most, she's a former weeb and really good at sewing/art
Bill: oh cool I kinda wanna meet her.
Aldus Larian (Jess): gabs getting marries the week before, and jenn has a baby/work so she ussually cant come
Bill: Anyway I don't say Normies as a bad thing.
Bill: ~~Did Aliza break up with her boyfriend when she came back to the states~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): he bf broke up with her but ya
Bill: oof
Bill: Not that I've ever met her. But I'm pretty sure she's the only single female friend anyone here has. XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jenn is single too
Bill: *wow* for a minute there I was like "aren't Jenn and Gabi both single" and then I remembered *Gabi is getting married*.
Bill: Brain fart.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _make sure to tell people no plus 1s, learn from Georgia‚Äôs mistake_
Aldus Larian (Jess): yee

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was *a time*
Nokri (Marisa): That sounds so awkward

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üòÆ
Elfriede Faun (Tom): üò¢

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nah

Aldus Larian (Jess): üò≠ <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yay for wig, sob for scary
Nokri (Marisa): it looks really nice
the bangs go past my chin so i have to trim that and i wanna make it poofier but it's a lot more accurate than my old one
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yay!
Nokri (Marisa): it looks nice but it doesn't suit me <:pew:543202259085950996> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~keeps checking email for any updates on Black Widow cosplay~*

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): my mom bought me Eva foam as thanks for running errands weeee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Weeeee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i also bought one of those condiment sqeeze bottles for my contact cement woot
Nokri (Marisa): if you say contact cement really fast it kind of sounds like condiment
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ahhh I‚Äôm so weirdly dissatisfied with my cosplay quality lately
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs hard motivating myself to post to insta
Nokri (Marisa): but your costumes are so great and everyone loves them :0
Nokri (Marisa): Did you get bad comments on something
Nokri (Marisa): i would get bad comments on some costumes (in person and online) and now I hate wearing them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): what???????? who am i killing
Nokri (Marisa): Everybody grab your murder weapon of choice <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~grabs Taiyang's weapon~*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh wait...

Nokri (Marisa): taiyang *is* the weapon
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): -flexes arms- *i dont need a gun, i already have two*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooo baby
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk I haven‚Äôt MADE anything new in like a solid year cause stoopid physics
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I look at like Pyrrha and stuff and I‚Äôm like god am I still pushin this old ass content
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I just wanna work on thor and have that done and start racking up some pics of that
Nokri (Marisa): starfire tho :0
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i feel like i dont deserve the credit on that tho cause i pumped that out in like 8 hours lol
Nokri (Marisa): o if costumes made in less than 8 hours are out then there go 98% of my costumes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): noooo marisa youre valid
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk i like the challenge of making new techniques on cosplays and not challenging myself in like a year has made me feel pooey
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thor foam gets here on thursday and then maybe when i start cracking at that ill feel better
Nokri (Marisa): what about making tiny things in between? not cosplay parts but like dolls or stuff
Nokri (Marisa): when you don't have time for a full costume
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): then i guess it feels like wasting money on materials that could go towards a cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): ooo that makes sense yeah. we get fabric dirt cheap and free a lot of time and bojo goes crazy when i make lots of tiny dragons and deer and stuff.

what about
Popsicle art
Nokri (Marisa): eat ice cream and make art it's win-win
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _honestly i should finish yona_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i have like 5 half finished projects oops

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hmmm I probably need an AnimeNEXT line up don‚Äôt I
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tom and Jess, when are you leaving Saturday of Anext?

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye so I was thinking like 9-2 doing RWBY and then like 2-6 doin ghibbles and then whatever for the formal

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs been a while ü§î
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I don‚Äôt wanna die trying to needlessly rush V5 Yang
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don‚Äôt actually even like V5 Yang that much either now that I think about it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Weird collar thing and butt flaps
