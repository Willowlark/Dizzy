Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm amused at the thought of mojo looking at the cosplay for reference and somehow thinking the collar was a garter
N🆗ri (Marisa): GOOD IDEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): The bell collar is stick in my wig fudlsndidoabgdiab
N🆗ri (Marisa): I need a selfie stick <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: train sylvia to use a camera.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I need Finn here to teach me the art of the lewd selfie so I can promptly forget it
Bill: I muted her awhile back cause she posted a lot, she did lewd stuff but not like, patreon style lewf.
N🆗ri (Marisa): But she does have a patreon :0
Bill: I don't follow that.
Bill: there's lewd cosplay subreddits, go there for inspiration.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): *what the hell color is Haku's hair?*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is it GREEN

Aldus Larian (Jess): "Haku appears to be around 12 years old in physical age. He has straight, dark green hair in a bob haircut and slanted, dark green eyes when he is human. Haku wears a short, blue hakama, white kariginu with a blue kimono underneath and beige sandals. When he transforms into his dragon form, he has a mint-green mane and a white, scaly body."

Bill: I do very little city exploring, but barcade was worth the trip.
Bill: also shoots.
Bill: Or I guess arboriums/hikes? Idk about nature things but if there'll be animals I'm game. I need more photos to balance my instagram pattern.
Bill: or getting drunk playing board games/watching Tom play Sekeiro I'm not picky.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Lay down in a field and enjoy
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Train Sylvia I def read as Transylvania
Bill: *lets go on a picnic yeah*
Bill: *i want to live the stereotypical slice of life anime tropes*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~we should go to the beach before beach season starts~~
Bill: Every episode of acchi kocchi is on my bucket list.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~quiet beach is my aesthetic~~
Bill: I do not need convincing.
Bill: Neither does Jess.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀 Lets go
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Jess much perfers hot beach
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But I'm sure cold beach she still likes
Bill: We can hot beach too.
Bill: I’d be cool to rent a place Friday and/or Saturday night or something.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I would love empty warm beach but that's not really a thing
Bill: Georgia’s rich, someone I. The family should have a private beach.
Aldus Larian (Jess): all beach good
Aldus Larian (Jess): quite warm beach best but rare
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah fam we got boats on lakes not beaches
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sowwy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof this one guy with an anime profile pic keeps messaging me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nothing bad but he messages a little too much
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s going to CPAC
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _defense squad assemble_
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whomst
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): who do we need to be wary of 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mag.cosplay
Bill: Just stay with me and give me the high sign when you want out.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not threatening just ANNOYING
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What’s the high sign
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): did we ever come up with a sign
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because if not, we need to
Aldus Larian (Jess): im just going with the "big eyes thing"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /panicked dabbing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~but thats me constantly~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sometimes theyre staring right at you tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I need like a word
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): big eye thing doesnt work, ive gotten trapped too many times doing that method
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :c
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): apparently big eyes is not universal code for help me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I figured something like “oh hey friend are the [word] ready for our shoot” or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): theres like nothing i can think that will work universally D:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "When's our reservation at Chili's?"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Y E A H
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): CHILIS
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): SAVING US AGAIN
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~does chilis take reservations?~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 🌶 
🙌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think so lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "when do we have to be at chilis"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But creepers don't need to know that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): creepers too stupid to know
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anything with chilis
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Only problem is it may open up the "Oh hey can I come?" question
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof you right ew
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Sorry we already have a reservation for 6”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SORRY ITs a DATE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO YEA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Me and my 5 boyfriends/girlfriends
Bill: Uh no.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sister wives
Bill: My original idea was asking me to check your makeup.
Bill: Cause that’s normal, but if they knew me they’d know I have no idea how to check it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats so random tho, in the middle of a conversation with a creep
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And it’s not urgent enough
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea it doesn't flow naturally
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _chilis is urgent_
Bill: Sure. But don’t make it chili’s.
Bill: We actually talk about chili’s.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Applebee’s, that’s the mediocre chilis
N🆗ri (Marisa): "sorry, I've had the feeling i'm gonna sneeze for like 10 minutes but there's no sneeze"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ruby Tuesday
N🆗ri (Marisa): wouldn't be odd in a convo
Bill: Ruby Tuesday lol.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Asking about reservations is good because it’s urgent enough to imply we need to confirm it relatively soon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So it’s perfectly acceptable to jut into the conversation
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea reservations for anything really
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and the out would be  "yea we have to get going"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Reservations is how Joey and I finally got rid of Nathaniel at RTX
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye or “we gotta finish our shoot and get going” if it seems not close to meal time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GOOD Ruby Tuesday’s is set
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): F
Bill: Again, just don't wander off alone and it'll be okay.
Bill: I at least seem to dissaude creepers from you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): human wall around georgia. like a cell. we only let in good resources
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tbh sometimes I’m talking to people I’m okay with too but then I get too much of them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Then it’s ruby Tuesdays time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats a mood
Bill: Should be a physical sign too...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Stressed out body language and asking about ruby Tuesdays seems good enough to me
Bill: idk, I certainly get the feeling you need an out at times, but half the time (for Georgia anyway) I don't know if you're just doing the fan interaction thing of being famous or are actually wanting out.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Mr floop F hand
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): F in the chat
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but IRL
Bill: I'm not your boyfriend and I don't tell you what to do, so just coming in like 'k we're leaving' when you're just interacting feels dick move.
Bill: *White fang gang sign*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA LMAO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ruby tuesdaysssss
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anyone can swoosh in saying we need to get to a shoot
Bill: So long as you don’t mind being pulled away.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OMG MAG.COSPLAY IS THE ONE WHO WANTED TO PLAY OVERWATCH WITH ME
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he was one of the GB Yangs at Zenkai
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): a cool one, or a creepy one?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh he messages me all the time
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's a big touhou fan. slightly creepy but i don't think he means anything bad?
Bill: Oh good, he's all over the place.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Pretty sure it was this guy. I think there were two GB Yangs and it wasn't the other one
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's him! i think!
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeahh
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wonder if I have anything trolly to post for April fool's <:minathink:544567715931750405>
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg can you cosplay seven from the April fools DLC
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dang I shoulda done Jaehee but I don’t have the stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): If you’re still at work it’s not too late maybe
Aldus Larian (Jess): Isn't he a paper doll?
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): CARDBOARDS
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): I haven't played it yet
N🆗ri (Marisa):

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH Jess we have the Pyrrha and Nora pics from Italian
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I meant Otakon but ok
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You could say you never shipped Renora lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Post this and be like "I actually ship Electromagnetism!"
https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4828/46603586952_97e96eda59_o.jpg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And then follow up with a pic of you and Tom as Renora and be like "lololol jk! Renora is love Renora is life"

Elfriede Faun (Tom): https://www.instagram.com/p/BvuRlL1lWb6/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1448c0aczi21k
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THIS OMG
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Prob should be in nsfw
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh well
N🆗ri (Marisa): gosh i wish that were me
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg i just saw that and died
Elfriede Faun (Tom): SO GOOD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he has a nice butt
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): damn
Bill: Truth.
Bill: Very much should be in nsfw.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah... does have a nice butt... not gonna lie
Bill: Not a lot of people did the star wars things?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not as many as last year
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): still quite a few
Bill: This was a repeat performance?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): send noods
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea
Bill: Send noods was better.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): last year was the noodle thing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea it was
Bill: I meant literally star wars.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but no star wars ia a first time thing
Bill: and one time thing.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but not as many people wanted to join because its very niche
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah the Star Wars thing didn't have a lot of legitimate participants
Bill: Niche and requires purchases.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the noods thing was more successful because it wasn't franchise specific
N🆗ri (Marisa): aww that a shame
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the ones who did do it though crack me up
Bill: it's great, I just figured there'd be more.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like I had to buy everything for that cosplay so I spent like $60 for a one-day meme
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~but the fun and memories from the shoot are priceless so it was worth it~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye, thats why i decided not to do it xD
Bill: awww Erik. You can get mostly naked in a hotel room with us anytime.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): thanks <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah next year they should make a more general one again
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Fucking Mag tho xD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): did Kylo Ren's lightsaber
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TOO GOOD
N🆗ri (Marisa): i want to know their username but also that sounds horrifying
Aldus Larian (Jess): its the same as anna's account! they share
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooOO that mag!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i didn't see it :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh omg it's so good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): basically she wore a gray bodysuit and had red tights and arm socks and t-posed
N🆗ri (Marisa): she now owns instagram
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I used my boost on my KiriKami post and it's actually working OwO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/zkon19
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ZENKAI FEEDBACK SURVEY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GO GO GO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ASK FOR A ROOM SET ASIDE FOR MEET UP
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /flies to BNE
N🆗ri (Marisa): GO GO GO
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're having discussions for the theme for year but i'm like 90% sure everyone has their heart set on DnD/20-sided dice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My feedback concerning the formal:
*First, I think the Sakura Ball would be more fun if the whole "formal ball" mindset was dropped. Other "formal dances" at other cons tend to be run more like high school dances/proms which is more than often more enjoyable than trying to adhere to a "formal" style. Breaking up a conga line and changing the song midway through seemed a little uptight of a thing to do for attendees just trying to have fun.*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AGREED
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok I'mma use Georgia and Erik's idea cuz I got nothing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): big sad, starfire and raven isnt getting much love
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its a shame when the cosplays i like, fallout and starfire specifically, get no attention at all
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho realistically if my followers had their way id cosplay only pyrrha forever
Bill: cosplay for you not your followers.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's the same for me only Nora is popular
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its just sadddd
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i used to grow 1K every 6 months
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its been 6 months and ive only gotten 300
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): big sad
Aldus Larian (Jess): 300 what? 😮
Bill: Followers.
Bill: Sure is a disappointment.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): followers
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean yeah thats no smol number but its less growth than i had before
Aldus Larian (Jess): There are only so many rwbys in the world
