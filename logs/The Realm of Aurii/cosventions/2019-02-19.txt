N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna complain about the hall judges and their treatment on facebook but i'm friends with people who are friends with the judges and i know they'll see it and pass on the word and everyone will hate me more <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: Hating you is ILLEGAL.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Bill: I’m still kinda just... eh on Katsu. I just didn’t get what I wanted from it I think.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just felt like trash. i could hear the person before me being judged and she was gorgeous and was having an actual conversation with the judges, so i was optimistic that i could have a decent talk with them. when i went in they didn't even say anything, it was quiet until I said hi and they said hi back and i asked if it was ok to start because they just sat there. i had a plan to try and be comical and upbeat in my talk but they didn't even smile at all, or comment on a single thing i said, or look at the references i had. it destroyed my confidence and i just wanted to leave.

then the next day they went on stage and acted all cheerfully and encouraged everyone to come try for next year regardless of skill level. like, i know my costume was trash, but i'd appreciate some basic human interaction? the only time i felt they were paying attention to me was when i left and they said bye. no questions or comments. maybe they were tired because they had been judging for two hours and hadn't gotten a break? but then how were people treated when they had been judging for 5+ hours? were other people treated like trash?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Let's kill em
Bill: Those are the people who need to be arrested.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know they're good people. i've spoken with the one guy before. they just weren't welcoming at all and i felt so alienated.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Don't feel shitty Marisa! You're costume was beautiful
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw it wasn't contest worthy
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just wanna know what was up with the judges
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's not how contest judging goes. that's not how judges act.
Bill: They clearly weren’t being partial and that’s not right.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i knew the costume was bad from the get-go but i was hoping the judges would be at least amiable with me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that's really weird
Bill: And Katarina was good!
Bill: There’s always room to improve, I’m not saying it’s the best costume you ever had. But you did GOOD and you can’t call it TRASH.
Bill: Judges should give constructive criticism if they feel the cosplay needs work. Not staredowns.
Bill: Katsu probably has an email for feedback right? Most cons do. Send one from an anon email or something.
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw. it was more fun waiting in line with the three cosplayers i met. they were so lovely. we talked about squirrels. that's why i like entering the best, the people in line are always lovely. i was worried before they showed up because the other people were hard to approach but they were fun to cosplay.

the judges usually don't give any feedback or criticism but they at least talk and treat the competitors like people. all the contest i've entered before, there was always an actual dialogue going with the judges. they'd pass my reference images around or we'd make jokes together (which is what i was relying on this time - i was hoping to make a bit of an impact on them with some little jokes but they didn't even smile or acknowledge anything i said)
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye there's a feedback but i dunno. maybe they were just overly tired? but then again, if they were tired when I showed up how bad did they treat the people after me
Bill: Sounds like the judges shoved a stick up their ass.
Bill: They cant be double sided, preaching support for everyone and then being pricks behind closed doors. They shouldn’t judge if they do that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH that's what got me during the masquerade. i left before the masq. awards were given out because i didn't like how they were being so bubbly and encouraging everyone to enter regardless of skill level after how my time went
N🆗ri (Marisa): i agree everyone should enter that's the fun, but it's not fun when they're treated poorly
Bill: I think that’s a valid reason to share. You’re being rational and not emotional, and you want to express your experience not out of spite (mostly 😈) but to better things for others.
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry about friday i was just antsy after that
Bill: I’m just glad we were able to be there fore you.
Bill: You can always lean on us!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'll fite them for u
N🆗ri (Marisa): no yeah i've known since katarina was an idea in my head that i stood no chance of any awards, katsu's contest is the most competitive in the country. but usually it's still enjoyable to enter. last time i entered as Ranka and the one judge was a ranka fan who was playing the song I was cosplaying from as I entered the room and it was cute
Bill: Ye, that should be the way it goes!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i lost my tablet pen while workin on jess's lightning lol but here's the wip
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHOA thats neat
バナナ: https://tenor.com/view/isaidhey-meme-heman-sparkles-hemana-gif-5207389
バナナ: SHE HAS THE POWER!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I dun wanna do Hera at Zenkai anymore I think... but _Starfire_?
Bill: Katsu was like... too many people. I think I’m feeling overwhelmed in a sideways manner. Also kinda unappreciated. Like. Rtx squad is great but Gen didn’t even say hi when she first saw me. Just cause far away friends are here doesn’t mean I’m less of a person to see. 

But if it’s overwhelmed it should subside I guess. I gotta stop thinking about it and sleep in a nice bed.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I never even saw Gen
Bill: Ye. It’s like. Overwhelmed by. Not. Having people. Idk. That’s one of a few examples.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not having people? like to talk to? or?
Bill: Kinda. It was hard to socialize with everyone when they had so many other people ~~they probably like better~~ so I wasn’t seeing people, and when I did they were busy with far away friends... it’s weird.
Bill: I had. A lot of flopped shoots. Renora and Maki both blew, I couldn’t figure out how to shoot Leanna in Penny with the flash (she went off with Jason to do the same thing, apparently she double booked it), Zeikani shoot was cold and we couldn’t find a good spot, Nier I was worried about everyone so I couldn’t relax. MM we waited too long on.
Bill: I guess that’s something to be bothered by.
Bill: I was excited for all of those shoots too.
Bill: Especially since the shoots were pretty much the highlights, Pyrrha Mina and Katarina being the top spot. That and the BNE circle at the BNHA party we’re pretty much my highlights. From my procon list, I wanted more quality time with people and all I got was bumps in the night kinda stuff, and the shoots flopping wasn’t making up for the lack of it. 

Next Katsu I need to not shoot most of the day. ~~won’t be hard, outside this group Monica is the only person to consistently ask me for photos~~ Cosplay or not, but not shoot. Y’all hold me to that. I wanna enjoy it more.
Bill: ~~nobody think about how that doesn’t change the quality time with people issue~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Im sorry you didnt have a good time 😦
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): me too
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~also why delete your synopsis of the event tho, dont you want us to know why youre unhappy so it doesnt happen again next year~~
Bill: I enjoyed some of it! Just not as much as everyone else and I’m sad about that. 

Cause I was spewing words and it tends to feel like people don’t care/have anything to say to that anyway?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean obviously we readin it cause we care about you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): youre doing the thing where you communicate well about something and then go "lol jk"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you tell marisa not to do that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): if youre upset with how you spent the con then just leave the message
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): we're youre friends so of course we care
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): of course we care! I was just stumped on what to say mostly.  we couldnt do renora cuz no wig and also boudoir is new for all of us. nier was fine! we we're just cold but thats kinda just katsu. MM got delayed too much but you cant do anything about it now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): min went well though! excited for that
Bill: Throwing words at the wall just sets you up to be let down tho... though I can’t manage to refute the Marisa comparison. Got me there.
Bill: I capped it to leave with my pro con list so there you go.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): sorry bill, we love you, but we gotta call you out when youre doin stuff that isnt gonna affect your own mental health
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea dont delete the feelies even if we dont know what to say we still care
Bill: Sometimes I don’t feel that way, but that feeling can certainly be coming from somewhere else. You’ve got me dead to rights, no deletes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): trust me on this one, "feelings" can be severely different than reality
Bill: ~~oh ain’t that a mood~~
Bill: Yeah. I’ll work on that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooh nooo i'm sorry that all happened biru 🙀 
katsu is weird in that everyone always seems busy at katsu and there's so much going on all the time.
everything happens so much
N🆗ri (Marisa): i want to protect them
Dirty Lego (Tom): Who wouldn't
Bill: I’m just learning what I enjoy. I want a good amount of time with a smaller group of people than spread thin across a larger one.
Bill: ~~which is counterintuitive to meeting new people but y o l o~~
Bill: OOOOOOF
Dirty Lego (Tom): OH NO IT HIM
Bill: If that guy added her I dunno why I still hesitate.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think I did too many costume changes this weekend and spent too much time in the hotel room changing and stuff
Bill: mm... I kept bouncing up to the room for whatever reason too.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yeaaaaa i think imma stick to one serious and one casual/formal a day
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  pics of you from the weekend

https://photos.app.goo.gl/Sq3D2smmwkWSuyyh7
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Owo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I didnt edit any of them so you guys can do whatever you want with them, portrait modes and regular should both be there, some of the portrait mode ones didnt come out right but the regular should be ok
Bill: One day I’ll get better at selfies.
Bill: One day.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yeaaa the only 3 i have with you are the ones from the BNHA pj party
Bill: I always step back when people take them cause I think they want all the cosplayers in the selfie.
Bill: I should just not do that, and if person wants another without me they’ll do that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i have 185 with tom damn, he took most of them though
Bill: ~~oh man Jess’s crush on Tom is so obvious~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tru
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this a gem
N🆗ri (Marisa): WOAH ALBUMS
He nom
N🆗ri (Marisa): Because it rhymes with tom
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is my favorite it really seems like a picture Jumin would take
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG XD the non blurred version is there too!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you might have to click on it and then swipe over
N🆗ri (Marisa): Shhh no non blur necessary we phase out of reality like men
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NUUUU i could shop them together too so that you're not blurry XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): NOOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is good is perfect!!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Rebecca is doing $30 shoots for zenkai I shouldn’t of cancelled that Katsu shoot <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA i just saw that
Bill: I don’t want to start thinking about Zenkai shoots already yikes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we def got more pics in front of that mirror in the lobby but i think my phone died, or maybe the ret are on marisa or toms phones
N🆗ri (Marisa): They on my phone! I shall upload them today!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sylvia wanted water from the bathroom sink I had to escort her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh yay! i thought they were gone 5ever
N🆗ri (Marisa): The security guard magically erased them
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NOOOO <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: I was think maybe I should do some form of charge for shoots... maybe even just a deposit that goes back when the shoot done, so the shoots are taken a little more seriously but... Now I'd say Katsu is bad evidence to go making changes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that be good idea i would pay
Dirty Lego (Tom): <@351471675843411978> OMG
Dirty Lego (Tom): That's a lotta pics yo!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you took alot of them XD
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'm kinda bummed
Dirty Lego (Tom): Kuz the leo shots are really good but I'm missing my scarf 😱
Bill: pack lists. I use em for the camera gear.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah most people use them
Dirty Lego (Tom): The list was just so long for individual parts for cosplay that I usually just write "Leo stuff"
N🆗ri (Marisa): lists are for lnerds
Bill: If it was me I'd do a different list for each cosplay.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats what I do
Bill: Pull the list when you need that particular one.
Bill: Also I dunno Mawisa, still feels weird.
Bill: The only shoot that the logic really applies to is Maki and Renora. Those just flopped. Leanna's thing she awkwardly timed, apparently was meeting Jason at the same time, and I kinda gave up when I couldn't get the flash to work how I wanted. Both Nier was weather based.
N🆗ri (Marisa): sowwy 😭 i even bought a tiara and tutu just for maki but everyone seemed tired at that point thursday and it would've taken a while to get makeup and stuff on. i did really really want to do her.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and ironing she needed to be ironed
N🆗ri (Marisa): again
N🆗ri (Marisa): i love this picture too they're all so funny
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you can do that, just remember you cant change the shoot time either. i wouldnt have put down a deposit for renora cuz tom was iffy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "when you're trying really hard to ignore the other you"
N🆗ri (Marisa): u coulda kept the deposit for maki owo
N🆗ri (Marisa): do u want me to send you a deposit
N🆗ri (Marisa): now
Bill: Absolutely not.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok maybe later
Bill: It's not even about cash, ya'll have seen my spending habits.
Bill: *That react sums it up well*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you're in focus on this one
N🆗ri (Marisa): shhhh nono
blur is better
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NOOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
N🆗ri (Marisa): though i will save that one too so i can make our heads bigger
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you look cute in this one
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah you do!!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NO U
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "so see this how i hacked your phone"
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): "i planted my carrots here so the potatoes have their own special area over here and auto-harvest every 3 hours"
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG PERFECT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): for both comment and pic
N🆗ri (Marisa): my legacy
N🆗ri (Marisa): saeran having a bunch of random mobile games he downloaded just to show MC he's not a creepy kidnapper he's really a game developer
N🆗ri (Marisa): "i made it to level 120 in love live just to show you i'm not scary"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG YES
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he def has those like "destress and play flowers" games
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): with the snail!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tom used to have it
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH AND THE ONE WHERE YOU GOTTA WATER THE PLANT EVERY TIME YOU DRINK TO STAY HYDRATED
EXCEPT INSTEAD OF WATER HE USES ELIXIR
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG TOO REAL
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol i think my photoshop crashed right as i finished the lightning edit
N🆗ri (Marisa): well not finished but finished for now
and then i'd revisit it tonight to see how it could be better
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH NO did u get to save it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): o thank goodness for autosave. it didn't save the most recent stuff but it got the bulk of it owo
N🆗ri (Marisa): it looked like this before, i can use this as reference to fill in the parts that didn't autosave
N🆗ri (Marisa): i also give u the original so u can add ur own lightning
N🆗ri (Marisa): ur better
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OO THAT COO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah your prob better with stuff like that!
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah graphic design is my passion
i'm gonna put my watermark on every photo right in the center in comic sans ok
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): <@!351471675843411978> if I did Starfire would you wanna do raven? I know we wanted to get those ladies done last year but never did oops
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I know you and tom probably wanna save monies too, and I think you own most of raven? So we could save money, live better, and look cute <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I could prob get her ready! im more comfortable with body paint now i still need to buy quite a bit of stuff but das ok cuz i wanted to get her done this year too I know you weren't feelin lore olympus too much anymore you said
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah we don’t have a full squad and if we did it’d be awkward /dabs away anxiety
Bill: Actually. Hal didn’t mention lore Olympus this morning. Thinking about it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): truuuu, we could maybe asemble a squad of our own, i have no idea what i wanna do at zenkai
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like i didnt get enough mina time but i dont wanna do 2 days in body paint lol
Bill: ~~lore Olympus sounds boring do other stuff~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Maybe he and Meg aren’t getting along as well anymore 😏
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Or more likely he doesn’t wanna do a cosplay that requires actual forethought
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You can’t really cosplay up in bodypaint on a whim
Bill: 🍯 🔫
Bill: I'm just saying though.
Bill: *Hooky*.
Bill: ~~Don't actually do Hooky in 30 days, not possible but~~
Bill: Mawisa did we pick a hooky for Georgia or just Tom and Jess?
N🆗ri (Marisa): HOOOKY!?
N🆗ri (Marisa): HOOKY
Bill: also like, Tom would make a fantastic dorian but could Jess really resist him cosplaying *Damien*?
Bill: 
Bill: He's a moody white haired sad boi.
N🆗ri (Marisa): are we doin adult versions
Bill: ~~We have to convince them first~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): hey guys u should do hooky
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): What is this
Bill: You should do hooky ye.
Bill: Webcomic.
Bill: REALLY good.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~toms getting tired of white hair i think?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i tried reading t but it didnt grab me
Bill: *Perfect Dorian has black hair*
N🆗ri (Marisa): what other webcomics u wanna cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): hooky?
Bill: Oh yes Hooky, good thought.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he also expressed not liking doing siblings
Bill: new plan, *Nico*
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): u do monica i do dani
N🆗ri (Marisa): or that
N🆗ri (Marisa): dorian/monica is the ship
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz we saw ayato and touka and he was like "ayato would be cool but they're siblings and..."
Bill: It's totally outside of his character types and that'd be cool.
Bill: Nico is a good BOI
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I got like 4 chapters in but i kinda dropped off
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru did you read the new chapter
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's so pretty
Bill: ye.
N🆗ri (Marisa): such beautiful despair
Bill: it's a slow starter.
Bill: Jess cosplay Monica, Tom cosplay Dorian, I cosplay Will. Jess is supposed to get engaged to me but loves Tom anyway. Super spicy. Georgia's mom will love it.
Bill: Sylvia cosplays *the cat*
Bill: Complete with scalera contacts.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): the cat is innocent and did nothing wrong
N🆗ri (Marisa): killing the cat is *murder*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Who me be owo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I told y’all what my mom said about A2 right
N🆗ri (Marisa): what she say :0
Bill: There's only the three lead girls. First thought was the girl who heroically dies cause you have a thing for dead characters. Alternatively, there's a time skip and Dani is totally different across the two.
N🆗ri (Marisa): could do angela
N🆗ri (Marisa): dani and dori's mom
Bill: who was the leader of the witch band?
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH her yeah :0
haha what was her name
Bill: Alex!
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's also the other princess who's real sassy
N🆗ri (Marisa): the sister of the flirty guy with like 50 wives
Bill: yeah!
N🆗ri (Marisa): if we have damien angela would work really well. family portrait.
N🆗ri (Marisa): or even just with monica/dani/dori
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Oof her later in the story though
Bill: woops I forgot that's not a spoiler.
Bill: 
Dirty Lego (Tom): <@245270932602486784> WUT SHE SAY
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She was like “darn that was a skimpy outfit” and I was like “it’s all tights except my face”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And she was like “oh that’s good to hear that’s ok then”
N🆗ri (Marisa): your mother hasn't been to a convention has she
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She has is the weird thing!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She’s seen Yoko cosplayers
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So it’s okay for me to show skin as long as I have tights too lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's tight yo
N🆗ri (Marisa): !!!!!!!
I’ve been hashtag blessed
I’m hip now right
Bill: Woo!
Dirty Lego (Tom): Your hip and happening
N🆗ri (Marisa): We’re official tomodachis no takebacks
Bill: See! He didn't hate you!
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m shook
Bill: how could you possibly be surprised.
Bill: Hating you is ILLEGAL.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not in 50 of the 50 United States it’s not
