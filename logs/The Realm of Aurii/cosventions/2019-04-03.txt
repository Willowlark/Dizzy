Bill: <@!386874959009415170> how you feeling this?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): chihiro halted by the queen
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YO THAT'S DOPE
Bill: Okay good cause as it turns out they don’t light up well, so it’s been a trip figuring out how to expose them right.
Bill: Set done.
Bill: Need to do a run through on laptop but.
Bill: Okay, the three photographers same model thing was three minutes, each photog choose a location and outfit. With cosplay the outfit isn’t really a choice.
Bill: Is there any other variety to add?
Bill: Not really right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mood maybe
Bill: That’s set by location.
Bill: Specifically, available light.
Bill: Thinking of seeing if Rebecca and Zeikani want to do one of these at CPAC or Kogara. Kogara Mawisa can too, I’ve seen videos of people doing it with four.
Bill: Though I feel like 3 minutes may end up being a rush.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what be happenin?
Bill: https://youtu.be/w9b07-9aDZs
Bill: I might want to do this.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): 3 minute shoots chop chop like gordon ramsay
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Cropped
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Wait gordon Ramsey isnt on chopped is he
Bill: Might up it a little bit, 5 or 10 minutes?
Bill: Even with me and Georgia shooting so much, I doubt we could do much in 3 minutes. Plus no one knows how to do that pro model “fast shift” posing thing. So a little more time since we all ain’t pros.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have some experience with it from japan but after a bit i start repeating the same poses
N🆗ri (Marisa): much difficult
Bill: I think that’s normal tho?
Bill: It seems like just a cycle of common poses.
Bill: But you gotta shoot it so you can’t be the model.
N🆗ri (Marisa): watch me selfie
Bill: Defeats the point.
Bill: shit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): goals
Bill: I'm pretty sure that's not possible though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): goals
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Goals
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably were sitting on something that got shopped out
Bill: yup.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah ofc lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but still
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): goals
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Really well done
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> do you still have that imgur album of 'behind the scenes' to cosplay shoots?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Although the Uraraka is wearing tights instead of kneehighs. Not accurate enough. 0/10
Bill: ~~you like tights tho~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye I gotchu one sec im on mobile and helping Anna with a sewing machine problem :3c
Bill: *That's our good girl*
Aldus Larian (Jess): real uraraka wears full tights tho so its the art that is inaccurate
Bill: For helping Anna, not getting the thing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I just say what I know tis all 
Here I go to my computer for cosplay pics nyoom
Bill: *You know everything though*
Aldus Larian (Jess): all know mawisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): nop

N🆗ri (Marisa): this one is such a mood
N🆗ri (Marisa): the mint eye mystic mess shoot be like
Bill: I brought a step stool to grey towers, actually. If we did more location shooting I'd probably start collecting some random cheats for photos.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have a pink folding step stool
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): begin the carrying shoots
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: 
Bill: remembering that one.
Aldus Larian (Jess): these are so good
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have that stool! but in pink
Bill:

Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): that could be us someone get a stool
N🆗ri (Marisa): meanwhile
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~now i want a selfie stick~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone captioned this with "Boxes have been really popular at conventions lately" ratsdjkfyjhg
Aldus Larian (Jess): sports anime be cray
N🆗ri (Marisa): was nozaki-kun cosplay gonna be a thing and if it was can we bring boxes
Bill: I don't think so?
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: It'd be great though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): viva boxes
Bill: Whose Mikorin.
N🆗ri (Marisa): glonk ur up
Bill: LOL
Bill: Wait, can we get a Mikorin and a Mamiko and then they do like, the exact same things?
Bill: It'd be adorable.
Bill: I'mma be hori-senpai.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg can mamiko be in black and white
Bill: YES
Bill: ~~Georgia can put the homestuck paint to work~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): did i watch this?
Bill: If you haven't you should. It's priceless.
Aldus Larian (Jess): did i read it? did i start reading it?
Bill: Jess is Kashima, cause all the girls love her. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

N🆗ri (Marisa): post nozaki appreciation in animemes
Aldus Larian (Jess): im too short to be him
Bill: *her
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's why we have boxes
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L3ifx7zIzA
Bill: All the girls love her, so she's the 'prince'.
Bill: She's a girl.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea im getting that now
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think i put it on my cronchroll list, but we dont have cronchroll anymore
N🆗ri (Marisa): "all of the class, besides mamiko, is on boxes"
Bill: I have copies, I'll get em to you.
Bill: You need to atch.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh my son jack loved this show
N🆗ri (Marisa): where are all these sons coming from
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~well you see, when a boy and a girl love eachother very much....~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i adopted a furry
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is ironic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Considering I believe Leanna and I have sons but no husbands
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Only like stepdads at best lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): now you've lost me
Bill: Jack and David, Kurtis and Noah.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): FOUND IT <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): see this why i love u
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): 17
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Firefly Festival: Hey single day passes are out
> Me: Don't tempt me Frodo...
Aldus Larian (Jess): i read fyre festival and i was like ERIK NO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol nooooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was actually thinking about it this morning and I'd love to go for the full weekend again
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But if you thought anime conventions were expensive...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I see now they have a "Super Duper VIP" package which is $7200
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMGGG NOOO D:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's way too much... takes all the fun out of it
Bill: for that price all the bands better place a private set for you.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but staying in a hotel takes all the fun out of it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): camping is the way to go
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA thats what i thought it was
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>  ohhh its one of those kind of events
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ooooof 300 for the weekend
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and no lineup yet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no they have the lineup, just not the schedule
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://fireflyfestival.com/lineup/
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh wheres the lineup
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah $309 for the weekend pass
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i like .....a LOT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): plus another $199 or $229 for a campsite
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~plus applicable fees~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooof
Aldus Larian (Jess): that must be a very smelly event
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): campsite holds up to 6 people though so if you have that many, the split cost of camping isn't bad
Bill: I recognized two of those bands...!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if by smelly you mean weed then yeah lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): all of saturday is like...my daily playlist
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so now im like 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but the camping areas each have community hubs with shower areas ~~$5 for a shower but honestly worth it~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like a few of each days line up XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~if you want to go and can afford it, I'll totes mcgotes go with you for the day~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEAH that's the struggle
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which is what gets you to get the full weekend lol
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think I went to one of those once
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom what?
Aldus Larian (Jess): youve been to a music festival?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye, i might bail out of rtx this year because of money and also arryn will be at wizard world... so  thats more cost efficient . SO that means i'll have money to do at least one big event
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah with my mom and sister
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~without ME?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the last good thing my ex did for me was let me have the weekend pass she bought for me since we were supposed to go together
Aldus Larian (Jess): HOW DARE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~and since warped is sold out~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I didn't know you yet silly
Aldus Larian (Jess): D:!
Aldus Larian (Jess): i guess its ok then
Bill: ~~yay boo rtx~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): wanna go to firefly festival babe? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~no one i care about is going to rtx this year except anna and wish~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): RTX is honestly only worth it if you're a big fan of multiple aspects of RT *or* you need an excuse to visit Austin
Bill: Which I have neither, yet I still get FOMO.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, i want to visit austin, but... would have way more fun if more friends were going
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so i'm prob gonna push it for next year or something
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i do like a lot of RT stuff, but i dont think its worth the hundreds of dollars to go this year
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): just so i can give arryn her robe >.>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah best to plan way in advance
Bill: 2020 Dish is supposed to be going but.
Bill: Still oof.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): eh i dont really care about dish xD i mostly just care about friend circles
Bill: True.
Bill: I just don't see the appeal. All the crazy southern rwbyies go there, the con-tent is boring asides from a rwby panel where people ask the same questions over and over...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): point is tho, i'm considering doing firefly for at least saturday
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone would have to pay me to go rtx honestly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh neat, Firefly has an "any day" pass so you can just buy it and decide which day you want to go later
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo nice
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😮 oh shit thats cool
Aldus Larian (Jess): id be so scared of the weather being bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): Saturdays lineup is gud tho 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): with how hot it usually gets, rain would probably feel nice lol ~~except then it'd get super muddy~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeeee thats the thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive only been to like 1 music festival and it was SOOO long ago aghh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): concerts used to be my thing before conventions death gripped me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i personally don't mind the mud, but i know thats a genuine concern
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they also have lockers you can rent that have their own charging ports for your phone
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo nicu
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it kinda adds to the experience though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like concerts, tom doesnt tho so i dont go to many
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): youuu can come with us and tom doesnt have to go 😮
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Unless he wants to of course
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye! idk maybe it is a pretty spence ticket even for one day
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you not wrong
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): valid
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's something to think about def
N🆗ri (Marisa): what anime is this
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but for the amount of potential bands you can see, it's kind of understandable
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea its a reasonable price i just have to figure if its worth for me
Aldus Larian (Jess): i really wanna see walk the moon why they gotta be on sunday
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea they kinda seem out of place with whos playing sunday too
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i thought so too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): with the exception of like vampire weekend i guess
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but yea, they in a weird spot
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo AJR is on sunday too ahhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh they don't have like... an older artist.. they usually have a band/artist that like, older people would enjoy
Aldus Larian (Jess): P!ATD is the grandpa band now XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like they've have Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, Earth Wind and Fire, and Bob Dylan before
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😂 😭
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OHHHHHHHHHHH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): HALF ALIVE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ok i gotta go
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont even like know what atists i listen to anymore XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've heard of paul mccartney
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he's the MC of the beatles anime
Aldus Larian (Jess): probably
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooooooooooooooooooooooh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): see
Aldus Larian (Jess): there he is
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo joywave
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like them
Aldus Larian (Jess): i know likw 1 song from alo of these artist but like thats it rip i am fake fan

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'm still thinking about it but im prob gonna do saturday
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): just saturday prob
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If I did it it'd be just one day yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly Friday is the best lineup but I'm not taking off a day of work for that lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea everyday has some artists i like and a bunch ive never heard of XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's how they lure you into doing the full weekend lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): good marketing
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeeeaaaaa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ive seen panic so many times that im kinda like numb to them now, so saturday is like my shit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they used to be openers or duel headliners for like every single emo band xD so it got so repetitive
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive seen them once, would like to see them again but not instead of the other so yea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): a lot of these bands have like, one or two recognizable songs to me so I just see a band that I recognize and I'm like "Hey, I may or may not want to see them!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh we gotta go Saturday so we can see Let's Eat Grandma
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and JPEGMAFIA
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know either of them but ok!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): do they vore grandmas in the audience
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is that..... how this works
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was what stuck out to me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just love some of the band names
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There was one my first year called Rainbow Kitten Surprise
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: We need plans this weekend tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i def would wanna go sat xD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol I'm glad we're all interested in the same stuff for the most part 👌
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, we're all pretty similar music taste wise xD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If we do decide to go, I'll rent us a locker
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I'll Boy Scout it up and put together an essentials list
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): one thing I will commend Firefly on that Warped sucked at is water refill station availability
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh bless
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh thank god
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): warped was so bad with that omg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they had like one station
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): for the entire venure
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Firefly has several spread out throughout the festival grounds and some are circular so the lines aren't so clumped
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and the lines usually move fairly fast
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I'm like really excited lol~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 🙌
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol this is just sad
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh god
N🆗ri (Marisa): only $115
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh my
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/antm-americas-next-top-model-miss-j-jalexander-omg-gif-3720930
N🆗ri (Marisa): what even happened here
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...did...did they... even try
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's like they watched rwby while falling asleep and this appeared in their dream
Aldus Larian (Jess): $115?!
Aldus Larian (Jess): you could literally buy regular clothes and piece it together and it would look better and be cheaper
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i hope no one bought that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ```you could literally buy regular clothes and piece it together and it would look better and be cheaper```
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): sounds like an Amazon cosplay challenge
Bill: But then you’ll piss off the people who champion “bought cosplay is valid too”. You know the ones who think if you don’t wholeheartedly support their way you’re the devil.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its still bought from amazon
Aldus Larian (Jess): biru, what are you talking about?
Bill: I’m coming into the conversation wrong apparently
Bill: Never mind!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Next season rwby outfit leaked
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao plz no
Bill: Nah. Next season is straight up crop tops from Blake and Yang cause *useless lesbians can’t dress for the Arctic weather apparently.*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): http://a.co/1JM7Hpu
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): $79 Amazon Ruby V2 outfit
Bill: you buying it buddy?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nah, just wanted to see if I could do it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the Amazon cosplay challenge that I made up
Aldus Larian (Jess): that would def look better than that
Bill: Wog not included in challenge?
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah cuz its not included with the $115 cosplay u can buy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hence why I also didn't include boots
Bill: Saying so will probably illicit facepalms but. Goals would be a girlfriend I can be like 'Erik bets this'll look better than the completed outfit for more money, I'm buying it in your size'.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Rather than a facepalm that sounds like a sugar daddy <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): unless gift giving is your love language i guess
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but i literally scored a 1 out of 12 so #cantrelate
Bill: I do not remember those, been far too long.
Bill: But you know, still get to appreciate gf in cute outfit so it's a gift for all.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok that sounds more sugar daddy again lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): u got them shoujo manga protag vibes
Bill: Just... call it weird flex and move on.
Bill: Talking about something along those lines just feels like I'll get judged. (not saying anyone is (unless you are owo) just why I don't bring that kind of thing up)
N🆗ri (Marisa): no judge. is cute. just worried u may find a girl who will use you if you meet one and do those things too quickly. an act like that should probably come after years of dating if both parties are comfortable with it.
Bill: You sound like my mother. XD
Bill: Justified though. I expect, in the hypothetical scenario where somehow someone finds *me* attractive enough to date me, all you friends to be hella critical for my sake. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): when that happens we'll be following behind y'all on your date and hiding in the bushes with binoculars and disguises
Bill: I expect nothing les..
Bill: * if
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah when
Bill: * if
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Disguise? You mean, *casual cosplay*?
Bill: *I mean, I can spot any of your cosplays a mile away.*
N🆗ri (Marisa): here's my list everybody pick a costume
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's 3 pages and biru admitted he hasn't memorized them all
Bill: YOU refuse to repeat a cosplay.
Bill: so that list is invalid.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i do under very specific conditions :3c
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats not true!
Aldus Larian (Jess): she wore emma twice!
N🆗ri (Marisa): and still haven't recieved katsu photos of it lol
Bill: who shot it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): anexagoras
N🆗ri (Marisa): t'was free so it's ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): i did give her spicy fruit roll ups
Bill: oh okay.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye she was recommended by a friend
N🆗ri (Marisa): because i needed last minute photogs
N🆗ri (Marisa): she's really nice!
Bill: Gunna get Rebecca to shoot you.
Bill: ~~as I train her photography skills~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am no longer good enough for the great tilt worm <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i shall spur webecca's growth to magnificent heights 🆙
Bill: No, I still get first dibs on your shoots.
Bill: *I just can't shoot all 30 cosplays in a week*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i only do like 12 a weekend
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): webecca-chan power up!
Bill: She gotta fill the *gaps*.
Bill: Jess too, cause *12 cosplays*
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess you're gonna do 12 cosplays??? WOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): WAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe total 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah total for a con
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> I was messing with you about the Zenkai photos... Maybe I should have started with the Pyrrha shoot. http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/gallery/2019/04/03/pyrrha-katsu19.html
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OWO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thaNK
Bill: welcome.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They look really good
Bill: Thank. They may be my best work to date.
Bill: I'm kinda impressed with myself.
Bill: now, Taiyang suffered a little bit cause I should have front lit in addition the backlight but.
Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/gallery/2019/04/03/taiyang-zenkai19.html
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the lights make those sooo coool
Bill: yeah. Colors and contrast are lost on his face cause it's all shadow for some, but the look is cool.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this ones really really good
https://live.staticflickr.com/7907/47531708441_251c97ae02_o.jpg
Bill: Ye the side lit ones are quality.
Bill: I know how I could make them better next time too.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😍😍😍
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They look great!
Bill: thank.

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): damn bill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you really have stepped up your game in the last couple months
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bill so good, i love all of these
Bill: The light is pretty flat in that Catra. It can be a lot better.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That hallway was a gold mine
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): With front lighting would be even better?
Bill: Since I don't really feel like hyping Georgia anymore...
Bill: Unedited, with the front lighting via gold reflector and flash.
Bill: Much, much better. Just took 5 shoots there to think of doing it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ohhhh the front lighting does wonders
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): damn
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof yeah
Bill: sorry guys.

N🆗ri (Marisa): I started working on chihiro at 5:30 and have reached my downfall
She’s about 75% done tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): You have her 75% done in 2 hours? 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah it’s an easy costume
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have the pink top done, just needs some hemming. This was the white under-kimono thing that I was hemming. White pants are done. 
Just need the belt, pink pants, and shoes which I’m waiting for yellow paint for
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👌 your so efficient
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh I didn’t make sleeves for the white top. I don’t think they’re necessary unless the pink sleeves slide down a lot. I should test that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I taped the pattern together yesterday today was only tracing/cutting/sewing and half the seams don’t get sewn together anyway
N🆗ri (Marisa): Birds nest fixed and hemming done <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
