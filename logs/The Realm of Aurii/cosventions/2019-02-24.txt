Bill: He should ask properly... but effectively yes.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 👉😎👉
N🆗ri (Marisa): like this?
Dirty Lego (Tom): 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait the weapon has a weird glow around it imma erase
also i feel the image is really missing Him
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Add him
N🆗ri (Marisa): The Gang's All Here (and georgia is less glowy now)
N🆗ri (Marisa): here is without Him™
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Amazing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Perf
Bill: When you say “cosplay is so expense” what are the numbers to that Georgia? Like spitball for A2 or something. I just don’t have a frame in mind for what non bought cosplays cost.
N🆗ri (Marisa): several hundred
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): in my experience they cost the same or more than bought cosplays
N🆗ri (Marisa): buying cosplay has gotten a lot cheaper recently which is nice. i'll buy if i can get the costume cheaper than it costs to make it. sometimes i make it before companies start selling it though, like ladybug or lucina <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ill buy if its cheaper and i like the quality or look
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but after factoring in shoes, accessories and props its ussually still a little cheaper to make
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like the bought version of the nora Vol 4 costume i dont like at all cuz i hate how shiny it is
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mina was cheaper to make
N🆗ri (Marisa): the mess that is katarina cost around $200 i think
akko maybe around $80? it's the fabric that gets expensive
i can't recall off the top of my head what each cost but if someone mentions a costume i can give a ballpark
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea fabric is expensive af
N🆗ri (Marisa): ray cost maybe $15 though (thank u for letting me borrow pants and saving $20)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea no prob! anytime!
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to spend another $10 to remake jacket again
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you gonna remake? 😮
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats pretty cheap tho cuz that fabric is legit
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee! stuff i can get at jack's is super discounted and comes out of my payment from him. he charges me the price he pays to stock the fabric, not the price marked for sale which i'm super thankful for
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh yea thats amazing!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): me and tom havent figured out how to properly estimate how much fabric we need so we always but too much
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like it was cheaper to buy a $25 dollar blanket then buy faux fur and that way i got a lining with it too
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): fur is so expensive omg
N🆗ri (Marisa): more fabric better than not enough because then you can never find the right fabric again ;u;
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea exactly that why we go ovwerboard
N🆗ri (Marisa): OK I THINK all the tomjess pics from my phone are on here
it kept crashing every single time so i had to do them in batches of 2-3 images

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it u
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it him
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it us!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oh when i say expense it sorta depends
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): wigs are usually 30 dollars, for a non complicated medium length wig
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): a sheet of worbla costs ~100 and you could use one sheet per armor cosplay about
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~but that doesnt include that times ive fucked up or rebuilt stuff~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): good fabric with a coupon is usually 5-8 dollars per yard, i usually get 3-ish yards so thats 15-24 dollars
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): shoes can be a big expense, generic heels are maybe 30-40 on a sale rack i guess? i dont know mostly cause ive had two used pairs of shoes for my last two cosplays
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and theres always misc content for characters, like specific socks (usually 12 dollars total at welovecolor)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): or gear (like pyrrhas metal boning for the corset)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like starfire is gonna come out to probably: 30 for wig, 50 for bodysuit, 10 for paint, 10 for sealant, 25 for fabric, hopefully 30 for shoes, thankfully i have foam sheets galore already after christmas
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so i already own green contacts ($24) and generic make up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oh god i rambled sorry
N🆗ri (Marisa): is good keep going!
rambles fun
N🆗ri (Marisa): fascinating
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im gonna say average for me is like 100?
Bill: My guess is like 100 for outfit, +50ish for prop, +50 for complexity like Katarina, plus minus a bit for reusable materials like color contacts.
N🆗ri (Marisa): really depends on how much you already have. if you're starting from nothing then it's gonna be more expensive. but if you already have shoes or plastic or makeup you can reuse it'll be cheaper
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea its actually hard to put a number on
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah it really depends
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Pyrrha is easily 350
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): including remakes tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): without remakes, off the bat it was probably like 250 at most
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): A2 was more like 60 because i had the heels, dye, paint, and fabric already
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont even know what my most expensive was
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): would the wood from nora hammer push it to the top?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh no
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was likw $4
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): then besides the wood i used floor tiles my parents gave me for free
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and poster tubes which were prob like 15?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): mononoke was pricey ish
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): weiss was probably 200, 300 if i had to pay for the prop lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yang was more like 150
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's funny because my mononoke was literally like $2 lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Star was like 100
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lolll
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _marisas just better at shopping than we are_
N🆗ri (Marisa): *no nonono it was a last minute halloween costume and i had all the stuff already*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yeaaa the only think i didnt have to but stuff to make, or buy was the white dress cover thing and i used boots i had already cuz that was gonna add even more
N🆗ri (Marisa): princess mononoke in clogs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): MM cosplays are pretty cheap in general sept i sprung to buy sevens jacket so rip ~~but i use it for a normal jacket so is ok~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): for me its shoes, wigs, and armor that shits on my expenses
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA shoes and wigs, and contacts sometimes
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!! jaehee was super easy and ray was also cheap
also depends on the effort you put into it, like ray's jacket wasn't really lined except for a few spots so lining fabric would've added more
N🆗ri (Marisa): my mystic mess cosplays are all made from stuff from dead people
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I literally owned everything to cosplay V already so he da cheapest
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea it depends on what outfit you do like any of the dress clothes are... well dress cloths so
Bill: Which Weiss?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but unkown was literally a $3 shirt from the little boys section and some grommets and tattoo paper
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): everything else was just regular clothes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): closet cosplays are so wallet friendly
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): volume 4
N🆗ri (Marisa): mahou weiss-chan
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): volume 4 the big expense was different types of dye, that racked up to like 40 bucks
Bill: That surprises me, unless it was the dye ah okay.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah plus 40 dollar shoes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): plus fabric
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): shoes are killers
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and at the time i ran out of white paint for the back jacket
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): THEY ARE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): shoes are DUMB
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and most thrift stores i dont really trust the shoes...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive been using poshmark latley
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i go into DSW and look for their sales
N🆗ri (Marisa): payless is going out of business
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just make shoes now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz fucking purple rain boots were like $50 anywhere i saw them or i just couldnt find them but i found some on there for like 15
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tom got a good deal on shoes for ashitaka at payless
