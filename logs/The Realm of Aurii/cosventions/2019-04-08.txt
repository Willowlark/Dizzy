Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: Be a REAL low light shot for my camera though.
Bill: One low budget tripod selfie via remote trigger on phone.
Bill: Which is annoying so I give up.
Bill: I am V <@!301927856240459777> be proud of me
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm proud of u biru
Bill: ~~I didn’t tag you but I basically did <@!351471675843411978> <@!301927856240459777>~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): u V 👏
Bill: I don’t have any other ideas.
Bill: No wait
Bill: *Why does no one love me*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): BIRU NO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): V NO

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~ugh he literally does that~~
Bill: ~~do it Ethan a real man can eat bullets~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: I’m most proud of this one; it’s like I’m a real fan
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🙌
Bill: Going from those lights to the rest of the house is a trip.
Aldus Larian (Jess): So much edge
Bill: It’s either a murder den or a darkroom, two types of people.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The real reason Adam wears the mask all the time is because his room in his parents basement is only lit with red lights
Bill: Lol wut
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And walking out into the rest of the house burns his retina
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Edgelord lighting
Aldus Larian (Jess): Probably
Bill: Now that I can use flashes to make edgy shadows I want to do an Adam shoot so badddd
N🆗ri (Marisa): I found my hat <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> that brings an ever so slight joy to me, all I gotta make is a skirt now. Everything for this cosplay looks awful because it was made like 8 years ago but I don’t really want to remake it for the con because this cosplay meant a lot yknow
Bill: YEAH CLASSICS
Bill: Also you looked great.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im sure it fine
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): own it, it's a throwback
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nostalgia value escalates when you can see how much youve improved
N🆗ri (Marisa): If anyone comments on it sucking I’ll drop kick them into the 1630s
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'll cheer you on
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah! I saw this and was like “wow I can’t believe I thought this was good”

I’ll dedicate the kick to you, front row seat
Bill: YEAH you MURDER THEM
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): HELL YEA
Bill: I'mma be so proud.
Bill: Proud Con Dad.
N🆗ri (Marisa): If you want to murder someone go for their eyeballs first that’s what they told us in high school
Bill: > *Oh wow, that's some pretty flat lighting you should know better Hun...*
> *Lissy...*
> *Urge to teach intensifies*
Bill: There’s a shoot in that group with the photographer bias...
N🆗ri (Marisa): april 20th. that's really soon.
is it just me or should they have made it further out
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah the event page is full of people saying they can't go
N🆗ri (Marisa): which sucks because the place looks cool
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Easter weekend too lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah all the comments are like "Easter weekend, can't go"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And she's like "This was the only time I was able to book until the end of May!"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then like... why not book for the end of May?
N🆗ri (Marisa): end of may isn't that far out yeah why not schedule it for then
N🆗ri (Marisa): more time to plan is better than a week to plan
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's only like a month later. Not a huge deal
Bill: She was trying to book an April shoot specifically.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh
N🆗ri (Marisa): o. <:thinku:543194478614413318> that would've been better to start planning in february then
Bill: Place is neat. Neat enough I’m bothered cause I don’t want to be a part of the group but it neat.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The place looks gorgeous though. Would be great for Harry Potter cosplay shoots
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We could always just go ourselves another time? 🤷
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably be more fun as a smaller group rather than that big one
Bill: That’s the kind of place you need a permit to shoot at.
N🆗ri (Marisa): if we could call ahead and arrange it possibly. depends on how this group goes because if they're too rambunctious the museum might not want any cosplayers to come back
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: Or they’ll say “we don’t want lots of groups doing this”.
N🆗ri (Marisa): seems like a rather religious and conservative center so i feel like after seeing the cosplay crowd they'll get scared
N🆗ri (Marisa): and the shoot is only an hour long?
Bill: I’m not saying anyone can’t or shouldn’t go if interested... (I won’t have 707 hack you if you disagree) it just bugs me.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, I like how Rebecca said "maybe" when that's also Heather's birthday shindig lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's from 1:20 to 2:30, photographers will be able to work with 2, maybe 3 people max in that time. by the time everyone looks around and explores and finds the good spots the shoot will be over.
Bill: Oof.
Bill: Even just location scouting this weekend it took 2+ hours a spot.
Bill: And those were smaller than a museum.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yikes I didnt realize how short it was
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Def not worth it unfortunately
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It is really cool though
Bill: 10 bucks for an hour? From a cosplayer stance that’s not so bad.
Bill: Get two three shoots planned, bang boom pow.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What is it? 😮
Bill: Museum cosplay shoot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's about what cosplay places in japan charge if you don't do all day
that reminds me
if anyone wants me to ask our family friend who owns the restaurant if we can use it before/after animenext let me know
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's only if you have your own photographer going though  lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like 10 dollars isnt a lot but you also have to take travel into consideration too
Bill: They can plan before via the group? Idk.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And realistically if you'll even get photos done
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Since it's only one hour
Bill: Yeeee
N🆗ri (Marisa): travel time for me would be longer than the shoot itself
yeah once you get there you have to start chatting with people and exchanging pleasantries and that'll eat up a lot of time at the beginning
Bill: I just don’t mean to be a downer on it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's a clever idea in theory
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But in practice its flawed
Bill: Typically places rent for an hour I’d say.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no ye. it seems like an awesome event and it's a stunning place but ye.
needs more time, both beforehand and at the event itself
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hard to achieve good results, at least with this particular shoot
Bill: So. That’s going to be common I’d think.
N🆗ri (Marisa): looks like the place isn't being rented out since it says to be mindful of other museum visitors
Bill: Indoors anyway.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): There should be a meetup before entering the museum
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): To talk to photographers and other cosplayers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Before you start eating up the time you paid for
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): With getting to know others
N🆗ri (Marisa): it'd have to be at another location though because we're not allowed to shoot away from the museum
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Which sounds kinda bad but I dont wanna drive nearly 2 hours to get to know photographers and not even get any good shots xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yeaaaaa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof
Bill: I like the concept but I can’t quite settle with the bias she shows.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what her bias? towards photographers?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh the restaurant is 20 minutes away from anext i thought it was closer
Bill: Yeah... there’s a handful of rules and stipulations to the group itself, “photographers must upload 2 photos of every cosplayer they shoot within 30 days of the shoot”.
Bill: I get some photographers are dicks. I do.
Bill: But I don’t like being treated like one by default, and I feel like that’ll temper the opinions of anyone in the group towards photographers as well.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that makes cosplayers more prone to thinking it's ok to be mean to the photogs
Bill: Also the photos are my copyright. I don’t want them on her google drive because she said so. She ain’t paying me.
Bill: I return more than most photographers, and I take longer than average (I think?) because of that and my full time job. I can’t just drop everything in my life cause she got jilted too many times by a photographer.
Bill: If you told me I’m being a bit over sensitive I’d agree with you, but like.
Bill: But nothing.
Bill: Fuck ‘er.
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw it makes sense
N🆗ri (Marisa): [slides this here for ur browsing consideration]
https://sofiaofmargate.com/gallery.html
Bill: You’ve shown me this before. 😃
Bill: I don’t think I’d want to go during Next (I like staying at the con itself) but if we have the shoot together I don’t mind making a trip to visit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wouldn't drag anyone down here out of their way
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a shame we lost the shore house
Bill: You can’t possible out of the way if we’re coming to see you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): why would anyone do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): can't see me if i keep hiding <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I know where you live.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is there room in someone's car for a suitcase this weekend
N🆗ri (Marisa): is there room in a house for it i promise i won't take up much space it's just for the sleeping bag
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea!
Aldus Larian (Jess): You can has the couch! And as much as room as you need
Bill: Easily.
Bill: (As far the car, I’m assuming I’m driving)
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just need like one foot of square space max tis all <:pwease:555585508819075112>
N🆗ri (Marisa): chihiro costume. pajamas. teef brush. pillow and sleeping bag. do i need regular clothes are we just gonna hang out in cosplay. how many cosplays are we hanging out in. what are we doing every minute of every hour broken down into an excel spreadsheet. how many spicy fruit rolls up should i bring.
Bill: Whatever you want to!
Bill: I can bring my lights to shoot at the Garrity’s if you want to shoot something there.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't impose i'm already taking up valuable space on their front lawn
Bill: ~~I’d also be imposing using my gear~~
Bill: But ~~Jess~~ they’ve already said they’re fine with it (not in the basement tho). Goes for whoever.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd be too petrified to bring anything more. if tom/jess wanna do shoots i can bring something but i'll just bring jade and chihiro otherwise unless there's a request.
Bill: You being silly. But, hanging out with *non cosplay Marisa* is a rarity.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's that
N🆗ri (Marisa): that suffix in front of cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:huh:555585958146473984>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ya you can bring your lights! Being as much as you need mawisa we have alot of room

Bill: You can open a kofi.
N🆗ri (Marisa): But caffeine is evil
Bill: Coffee is just an analogy. Also how do you survive.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Gummy vitamins and 18 hours of sleep a day
N🆗ri (Marisa): 18 or 1 there is no in between
Bill: Have you not eaten more than gummy vitamins today.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye
