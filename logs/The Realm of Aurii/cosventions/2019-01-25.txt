Bill: Probs more efficient that way. So wedding maki, badges, move more people in, dinner (unless peeps want to eat on the way down, not a bad idea tbh), then 10+pm spicy renora. Or we do it on sunday. Was considering, depending on space in rooms, moving light stuff back to car thursday, but if we're doing spicy another time that fine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): O I don’t mind where I go. I’d like to stick with aurii since I don’t think I know anyone in the other room aside from anna from BNE chats? But I can go in either
Bill: You do what you're comfortable with Marisa.
Bill: Which is stay with us.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pink camo sleeping bag is a go
N🆗ri (Marisa): O just got a zenkai email. Spooky.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Still no assignments come on Kiwi
Bill: riiip
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is Marisa and Georgia are both ok with air mattress then we can tell the others that they can have beds as long as they share
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Which I think it's what's happening?
Bill: The only 'variable' setup here has been if Tristan and Scott would share.
Bill: s'long as they do yet.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea
Bill: Marisa, are you okay not being on a bed? *I know you won't say it unless you're asked about it*.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye is good I usually take the floor at cons <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Okay. Then once Georgia decides what she's doing we're good.
バナナ: yes i do have a single sized air mattress
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve been working on this for two hours it’s such a pain
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s not even the same in any two pictures aaaaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): I found corn and maki thank goodness 
Also found my first convention cosplay!!! Woah!!! It’s so poorly constructed haha but wow this is really cool. Over 10 years old now.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i wanna see
Bill: This ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): And I found more plastic pellets and a glue gun and glue sticks today is wonderful
The costume 10 years ago or as it is now? I didn’t see if the accessories were with it
N🆗ri (Marisa): I didn’t use a wig back then either it was bad
Bill: that makes it even easier to show, you just have to put it on.
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is me 10 years ago with BoJo because you can’t have 13 year olds unattended at a con that’s illegal
I won like 3 volumes of chobits for free though that’s not illegal I guess
Bill: Your hair was green?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ya I used one of those Halloween spray dyes that wash out
N🆗ri (Marisa): Cuz no wig
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): baby
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): who u cosplay?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Koyuki from sgt frog hold on I have a comparison pic from eternity ago
N🆗ri (Marisa): Behold the low quality
I didn’t make the mask because she doesn’t always wear it
N🆗ri (Marisa): Long modesty skirt lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nicu
Dirty Lego (Tom): OMG
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ninja
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Pic I posted Yesterday is doing very well for Noragami for me? I usually get under 100 for anything Noragami
Bill: New outfit perks!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~jumim doesn't really make sense to have with Ray and suit saeran and mc imo~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye i was thinking that lol
he kind of gets along with final ver. saeran? the one we're missing hehe
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA that's like the only time they are together
Bill: I just want to seem him do mystic messenger again lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): And Erik hasn't played that route
Bill: I remembered him doing that suit song thing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye.
Bill: You can point out he doesn’t sync up tho. Blame me not knowing, cause I don’t.
N🆗ri (Marisa): u should play mystic messenger
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mmmm not really in da mood for talking on BNE right now tho
Bill: Oof. You want me to tell him? It was your shoot first.
N🆗ri (Marisa): considering jaehee as a chill costume for during the con because it's a little silly to bring elizabeth for monday only
biru do you have any free time whatsoever during the con or sunday for a mini jaehee shoot
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm feeling a little anti social and I don't wanna come across as gatekeeping
N🆗ri (Marisa): valid
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz like das rood
N🆗ri (Marisa): if he brings jumin we can do a jaehee/jumin shoot and you can be MC and tom can be menacingly hiding in the background of every pic
N🆗ri (Marisa): oops we convinced him
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But that's a different MC <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): o you don't have the sweater too?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I do but I wasn't gonna pack it 😭
