N🆗ri (Marisa): we should do photo editing streams sometime
Bill: I did try that once.
Bill: Think I’m going to keep to discord on phone only. Rather than keeping it up on my PC all day.
Andrew: I look like I'm staring into the soul
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru has inspired me to work on photos but mine suck more <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
erik i have your sakura ones in a minute
N🆗ri (Marisa): pls wait with this
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Shook™
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have the originals so if the mega pink and overly blurred backgrounds look too atrocious lemme know and i can change for no extra fee
the secret to my photos is not to zoom in real close and see all the messy editing <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Bill: Am excited for Marisa photos.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> you look BA. Probably should smile more but it'd be hypocritical for me to say that, I never smile.
Bill: *Are you telling me I can't be excited*
N🆗ri (Marisa): be excited over normal things like the Artemis Fowl movie
Bill: <@!386874959009415170> Since she didn't at you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): good things
Bill: I don't give a flying fuck about that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i didn't want to bother him with a ping if he was busy
Bill: You 👏 are 👏 not 👏 a 👏 bother 👏
Bill: People want their photos.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh when does the Artemis Fowl movie come out?
Bill: Which is why I am excited by your photos of me and if you tell me not to be again I will order Dominos with a special delivery request to write "love" in pepperoni on the pie.
N🆗ri (Marisa): August 9th!! after 10 years of waiting!!!! bigger than endgame!!!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *allergies.jpg* asdkjsdklfj 😂
Bill: This is COOL Mawisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotta put beards on all your photos sorry it'll take a little bit longer but you'll have twice the number of photos!! beard and beardless!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): o that's not me that's erik!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh that last one looks really good too

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mawisa do you mind if I do some small blemish removals? I had some wicked razor burn on my face that day
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee go ahead!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i didn't notice sorry ~~but i also don't know what razor burn looks like, it sounds painful~~
Andrew: Yes I'm still hype for Artemis fowl
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *before*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *after*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OwO Marisa photos?
Andrew: Also thank you <@184437198865563648> and I've been told that before
Bill: Did I share these?
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): That is the first I’ve seen them and I can’t believe you’ve been hiding these gems
Bill: Welcome Andoru. Shouldn’t have walked away so fast.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Siiiiiiight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yikes dude
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _wants to do a shoot with me, has no idea what im cosplaying_
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh god
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably doesn't mean a full shoot. Probably just wants a photo with his best friend
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): me: says idk what im wearing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): him: are you wearing yang or pyrrha
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i do not know my duy_
Bill: You aren’t even confirmed for Next.
Bill: “I’ll be busy helping run the shoot but if there’s time maybe. I have to go do something important now bye”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "I have a reservation at Applebees"
Bill: That’s called “block”.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh Georgia used the Applebees line yesterday and it worked 👌🏻
Bill: Wheeen?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): As we were leaving
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just like tell him your arnt going and if he he sees someone that looks just like you, it's not you and also of he sees anyone that looks like your friends, also not them
Bill: Ah. I was wondering if it’d get used for Ness kid but I didn’t hear it, wanted to make sure I didn’t miss it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Someone was talking to her and she said "Oh actually I have a reservation at Applebees" and then Leanna went over, grabbed her hand and said "WE NEED TO GO" 😂
Bill: Scene from Psych that’s a relevant mood: Jules is in danger from something or other in a case and Shaun like “I’ll stay with you tonight” and she’s like “Shaun I’m the cop and have a gun” and he was like “yes but please let me do this” cause he was worried and that’s SUCH my mood.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh those are gems damn
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I love Psych
Bill: As do I. Lord knows how many times I’ve seen it now.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Haven't watched it ask the way through but I enjoyed it whenever I'd watch it on TV <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: It’s on amazon prime video.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Started watching when it first came out because we were big into Monk at the tine and those were USA's like, biggest shows at the time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *y e e t* I'll add if to my list if things to watch when I have time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof next time we do the applebees thing I will be less blunt xD I was just so fucking tired and hangry that I heard it and immediately was like " LETS GO"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "This tummy empty. YEET"
Andrew: <@!184437198865563648> wut
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OOF
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...... noooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yikes
Bill: Oh wonderful. He going to start messaging me? I’m not as nice.
Bill: As awkward as it must be for you, hope you’ve kept the “we’re dating” assumption up lest he be like “I need someone to cosplay my oc and Yang’s wedding with me”. -_-
Bill: Also just cry “avid bee shipper” to get out of pairings.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Welp, guess you're cosplaying Pyrrha lol
Bill: Or do Weiss to really throw him.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The Sakura near work is the good shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Got some fake black converse at Payless for cheap for Jaune
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NICE
