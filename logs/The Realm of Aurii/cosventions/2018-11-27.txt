Bill: Well... if I visit Tomu and Jess to borrow the wig head and style Mirio, I could do that at BNHAkon. Not that I have anything christmasy.
Bill: ~~actually what is Tom even doing for that~~
Bill: ~~I only know Jess is doing Mina~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm not anymore
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Jamie doing Mina
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also traveling 2 hrs in body paint is blah
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~also we're both low key having second thoughts about about konkon~~
Bill: oooo?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We don't have any plans, were dropping alot of money on Christmas this year so we don't really wanna buy anything new, kinda feel like we are out of time, we didn't ~~excactly enjoy freezing and getting gawkrd at last year either~~
Bill: Less of a cohesive group, and there's not much to do beyond get photos.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): On top of that the didn't really feel comfortable going into any of the shops in costume
Bill: I'm told there's not much to the shops, honestly.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea so konkons a maybe at this point with us but Tom's not feeling it at all and inclined to agree
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I know I'll feel left out day of but... Idk if it's worth
Bill: Can't really argue with your points, and they all pretty much apply to me too.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My other idea was nejeri but I feel like she's not big enough for a holiday version even
Bill: You could take a camera, if you wanted to photograph for the day.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Eh
Bill: Big three got some good recognition at ANYC.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea in canon outfits
Bill: but again, spending money.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): In Christmas outfits I'll look like that girl from fairy tale
Bill: Juvia lol. Fair point.
Bill: I‚Äôm not going to try and convince you tbh, I get where you coming from. Especially if it‚Äôs cold as hell.
Bill: I dunno if I‚Äôll want to drive alone too.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea it's just not appeling to me anymore
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm gonna have a busy weekend this weekend too, so no time to work on anything
Bill: You might be able to get away with mostly reusing parts of Nora, but Tom‚Äôs Ren was pretty to the character.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yup and there's still the freezing part
Bill: Could technically wear an ugly Christmas sweater and be done with it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea those aren't cheap tho
Bill: But that‚Äôs less interesting for photos, and photos are the only thing to do asides chat.
Bill: ~~I figured you‚Äôd have one~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nope
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They are usually like $45 so I've never bought one
Bill: General closet cosplay is the same thing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sure but like I'm not gonna drop $45 to do something I already don't wanna do at a time of year when $45 could buy gifts for people
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm feeling financially restricted rn due to buying a car and a windshield and now Christmas, and then katsu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Doing me a big stress , gotta sleep noaw
Bill: Yeah I was saying you could skip the sweater and do closet stuff (never meant to say buy one), but you‚Äôd still have the same meh problems.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you could come cosplaying as tom and jess in warm outfits to still hang out ‚ù§
Bill: Yeah that. Still going to freeze.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ü§î I'll think about it
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: better one, or two?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is this the eye doctor
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): They are pm the same
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Maybe 1
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But like, they are pretty much the same
Bill: They are the same. One just has some crappy spot editing out the edge of the table in the top left.
Bill: this is why I don't edit!
Bill: I should use preset more. I only look at them for actual photography, but they make this editing process non existent and I dig it.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Twoooo
