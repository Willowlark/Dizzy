Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So there's a cosplay I've toyed with wanting to do and now I think I want to do it for Katsu
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): What is it
Bill: ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Zaphod Beeblebrox from Hitchhiker's Guide
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *and it'll election year so I will be holding a "Beeblebrox/Prefect 2020" poster*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've had a burgundy coat and metallic gold shirt in my amazon list forages *just in case*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Omg
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yes
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Are you gonna do the second head
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Neck head
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Neck boi
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probs just one headed version
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not spending $1745 on a silicone head
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh yikes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://smile.amazon.com/Original-Movie-Prop-Hitchhikers-Beeblebrox/dp/B00B5LR0AG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NEVLPH3CMYEW&keywords=zaphod+beeblebrox&qid=1567131085&s=gateway&sprefix=zaphod+%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-1
Kaio Vermino (Lee): https://tenor.com/RjR7.gif
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but allegedly this is the actual prop from the film???
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): That's so gross LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Lee): You could 100% get falsely arrested for owning that
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I believe it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the fact that it's a collectible movie prop makes me kind of want it despite it being revolting
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Put it in your fridge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because I'm one of the few h2g2 fans that actually enjoys the movie
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I liked it but to be fair I never read the books either
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But I also just have a weakness for Zooey Deschanel
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's where I first discovered her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and Martin Freeman
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea hes great too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i dont know how i made it to actual adult life and still have no idea what that is
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:shrek:554719881216524310>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): other than a book? i think?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): How have you made it this far
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i have no idea fam
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i had no friends who cared to show me it seems
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i dont think ive even heard an explanation of what it is
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ... to be fair it's kind of hard to explain fully
Kaio Vermino (Lee): You gotta just watch it, or I guess read it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The story changes with each retelling
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Though I also still need to read
El🆓de Faun (Tom): maybe thats why lmao
Nokri (Marisa): YES
Nokri (Marisa): I DIDN'T READ THE CONVO I JUST SAW ZAPHOD
Nokri (Marisa): AND NOW IM WAY DOWN HERE BUT YEAH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There's honestly not a big plot in the book which is why they had to add so much to the movie do it actually had a plot to follow
Nokri (Marisa): i have the dvd and all of the books tom organize a party to see them all
Bill: I have the radio play.
Nokri (Marisa): bring it
Nokri (Marisa): to the party
Nokri (Marisa): someone get the text adventure game
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good find in the bargain bin at B&N when I was like 12
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I HAVE THE BBC TV SERIES TOO! WE CAN WATCH THAT
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Nokri (Marisa): i gotta reread the books because i barely remember anything after So Long And Thanks For All The Fish
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **but what is it ahhhh**
Nokri (Marisa): it's great
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Scifi series
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 5 books in the original trilogy and then Eoin Colfer wrote the 6th installment (which I have yet to read)
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!!! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> 
*but we still don't have the artemis fowl movie.......................*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *5 books in the trilogy*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Does that statement sum it up xD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's the humor if Douglas Adams
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's great
Nokri (Marisa): now i want to make a tiny marvin
Nokri (Marisa): pls cosplay zaphod in the future
Nokri (Marisa): what was i doing before this <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@334090409389195266> I'm not saying you should do Trillian, but you should do Trillian
Nokri (Marisa): i have this version floating around the house somewhere, it looks so fancy for what's inside it and the pages are gold
Nokri (Marisa): LEE DO IT
Nokri (Marisa): no pressure
Nokri (Marisa): ~~*you should consider it* <:rapid:607237006539489310>~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I should
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I will
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.instagram.com/p/BZnGnFmFJ31/?igshid=nwo5o6e4m7tm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Arryn did it for a Halloween episode of Always Open
Kaio Vermino (Lee): YEA I REMEMBER THAT EPISODE OF ALWAYS OPEN
Kaio Vermino (Lee): IT WAS SO CUTE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I WAS SO EXCITED
Kaio Vermino (Lee): SAMEEEE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Shes so cute I'm gonna die
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm so glad it's so much easier to find ridiculous oversized sunglasses in this decasde
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm also not familiar with it either but we just did some googling up in this house
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH BUT I CAN DEFINITELY DO THE THIRD ARM
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): fun fact, I dressed up as Zaphod for Halloween in 2006
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): of course, no one knew who I was
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Con people will know
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *con people will definitely know*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea for sure
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok, yeah, this and Widow are going to be my two big cosplays for Katsu
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I'll actually commit to doing trillian
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Because cap is already done for katsu and my only other commitment is vol 7 yang and MAYBE finishing ozmas armor but I'm not holding myself to that cause I'll most likely wear yang more
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Sooooo if I add trillian that's not that big of a deal and looks fun to make
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I wanna do her blue outfit with the giant cuffs lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): looks like it's made of fleece
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *a warm cosplay at Katsu? whaaaa?*
Nokri (Marisa): sounds fake
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Hopefully it's not 80 degrees this year
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Like it was 2 years ago
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Or was it 3
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oooo
Kaio Vermino (Lee): It's either fleece or flannel
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Either way, warm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It looks like when you wash fleece a lot
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea like pilling a bit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like not soft and smooth, kind of bumpy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *pilling*, that's the word I meant
Nokri (Marisa): oh, worm?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I could probably find a way to get that texture... I'm excited
Kaio Vermino (Lee): This is like a slight challenge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm excited to make the thinking cap
Kaio Vermino (Lee): YES
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *looking up cheap citrus juicers*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The fur coat will probably not happen but I added one *just in case*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oof you should check poshmark for a fur coat like that, might be cheaper?
Bill: I feel like I should join this since I live in 42 village green, but I don’t remember it well enough to want to do anything.
Nokri (Marisa): be the computer!
Nokri (Marisa): is that your address? 42 village green? no other unit numbers or anything else? asking for a friend
Nokri (Marisa): near a home depot? 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): be Arthur!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): big green comfy bathrobe, pajamas, *no wig*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I second that
Bill: I’ve already sent the address. It’s apartment H. Google maps will direct you to the center of the complex tho. It doesn’t recognize the actual apartments.
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): you've never made a post here with the full address
Bill: Ye. Have.
Nokri (Marisa): it's not coming up in the search
Bill: Def have.
Nokri (Marisa): nothing for 42
Nokri (Marisa): :3c
Nokri (Marisa): **dox yourself**
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think your just posted the map location not the full address
Nokri (Marisa): a full address isn't coming up in the search results for village green either
Nokri (Marisa): *biru don't go offline you need to dox yourself*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Nokri (Marisa): there it is. the full address
Bill: I just got home jeezus.
Bill: 42 village green apt H budd lake.
Nokri (Marisa): sorry for wanting to send fanmail
Bill: Claude is actually missing a section of embroidery which wouldn’t bother me except for the fact the lack of it kinda makes my gut stand out.
Bill: The zipper is actually stupid low on this isn’t it. 😭 I must have fucked up the measurements again.
Bill: Maybe not... the art just draws the tails more flaired is all.
Bill: That's the lie I'm going to believe... Though maybe? maybe it can be tailored shorter?
Aldus Larian (Jess): the zipper or the hem?
Bill: the hem. Zipper is fucked I think.
Bill: Then again, cutting the length of the jacket cuts the length of the seem cause the zipper can't move up soooo it'll look off balance...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can't tell where the zipper ends
Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ah
Aldus Larian (Jess): hemming it an an angle could work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah if you wanted the zipper adjusted, you'd have to have the whole zipper removed and trimmed or replaced with a shorter zipper
Bill: which I doubt they'd do, tbh.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because if you're looking for it to be more accurate to the art, the zipper would probably be around here-ish?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): well yeah, you'd have to do it yourself or have someone do it for you
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea lools like zipper would be a little below the belly button
Bill: It is actually supposed to sink lower than that, just not as low as it does on me.
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): like crotch level
Bill: Pretty much.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): looks like it could almost be a double zipper that zips from the bottom up as well because different pictures are kind of inconsistent
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea! thats what i was about to say
Bill: It's kinda an odd outfit.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's true for just about every fictional character lol
Bill: also true.
Bill: I think the whole thing coming up like, two inches would be enough.
Bill: <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Bill: Only thing to do is take it to the cleaners and see what they can do if anything I suppose.
Bill: Might  skip Claude at CCE though...
Bill: Looks good from the bust up tho? Positives.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): It only really needs that waist seam to both make the zipper look normal and also for the tails to fall at an angle
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But otherwise it looks really good
Bill: You lost me.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Where the missing embroidery is
Kaio Vermino (Lee): That line all the way around the back is supposed to be a concealed seam
Aldus Larian (Jess): that would probably also cause it to flair a bit more? i think?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yep
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Like once you cut it straight across it has to be cut almost like a circle skirt and reattached at that seam
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Which will flare it out and also create a waist
Bill: by cut it straight across you mean actually cut the jacket in half where that seam should be.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Mhm
Bill: Yikes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea if it was made from scratch those probably would have been separate pieces from the beginning
Kaio Vermino (Lee): XD yea it's kinda scary but not super difficult. I could potentially do it for you after CCE or if you take it to get alterations at the cleaners you could just say what I just said
Bill: I get the distinct feeling the cleaners would say that's above and beyond what they do? That seems less alteration and more reconstruction, or do I think it's more uncommon a need than it is?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Couldnt hurt to ask
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Would take just as long as like ... adding a zipper or something they normally do
Kaio Vermino (Lee): So it might not be as crazy as youd think
Bill: anything involved in crafting clothes is still pretty crazy to me. I'll take it over there and see what they say. I'll scrap Claude at CCE then, cause the jacket too long wear nicely. ~~Not that I wouldn't be more than happy to trust you with it, but I feel distinctly bad taking up your time with it~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): If they say no or anything just let me know cause I could do it when I have spare time o3o
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ~~its kinda like productive procrastination when I dont want to work on my own things~~
Bill: I mean, if you kinda want to do it, and as time isn't super a factor (next con isn't till ANYC, if Claude were even to be there), I could put the money for the alternation in your pocket rather than the cleaners?
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> did you get the photos off my dropbox?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): SHIT NOPE
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'll set a reminder
Bill: Well, Claude aside.
Bill: Fatgum is a good swimsuit cosplay apparently so imma be good with that.
Bill: So imma be fatgum Friday.
Bill: So Fatgum Friday, Hazel Am Sat, Jumin Pm Sat... Yeah I guess that's the final.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoo!
Bill: I'd say maybe Mirio, since wog, but considering shirtless Mirio is both canon and ripped, meeeeeeh save it for a con with clothing.
Nokri (Marisa): draw-on abs
Bill: The abs will then jiggle. Fatgum works.
Bill: The only way I’d even care one way or the other is if Tom and Jess did Nejire and Tamaki.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Bill: That’s not a PA way to convince you to either. 😅 I don’t wanna do a swim Mirio personally. 👌
Nokri (Marisa): pensylvania
Bill: That's it you got it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *The Pennsylvania Way* <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): it's not part of the outfit, but i'm gonna wear a squaredancing petti under my dress tomorrow because it makes it look so much better. the dress doesn't have anything under it in canon, but it always looks flowy in pictures and in real life it's so flat without a petti. i hope no one calls me out
Aldus Larian (Jess): they better not
Nokri (Marisa): Banned for petticoat crimes
Nokri (Marisa): i thought the rwby and mystic mess groups for cce were roughly the same size, give or take a person or two?
Nokri (Marisa): biru erik lee andru marisa and a lot of bne for bnha stuff?
biru erik lee marisa for rwby?
biru erik jess tom marisa for mystic mess?
is that wrong?
Bill: That's right?
Bill: Wasn't sure who was doing RWBY.
Nokri (Marisa): o you said the rwby group is a smaller group so i was considering not doing ruby then
Bill: And it in fact smaller than *most of BNE* doing BNHA friday.
Nokri (Marisa): but most of bne isn't rooming with us
Nokri (Marisa): our genderbend group isn't really big
Nokri (Marisa): was it ok to mention aurii to people who aren't in it 🙀
Aldus Larian (Jess): they were in it
Aldus Larian (Jess): but now they not cuz inactivity
Nokri (Marisa): ooo
Bill: I could bring full Fatgum if I glue the knob bits on the kneepads. I don't think there's a point in full Hazel tho?
Bill: Are you doing the full hero Kiri Erik?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *possibly*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): depends on whether Will is able to get enough bookings to be able to go, otherwise I'd do my video thing with him at ANYC or Katsu
Pawlitics: Christina makes such a good Annette omg
Bill: Talking to Anna with Andrew about his Dimitri armor, but damn <@!334090409389195266> it just what you said too.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!184437198865563648>
Bill: Scrapping plan to do Claude though, cause I'd rather wait till the jacket gets altered. 😭
Bill: Unless the hoodie version gets here beofre then.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Wait what did I say xD I'm confused
Bill: Earlier about doing other people's cosplay stuff is a good break from your own work.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): OH yea
Kaio Vermino (Lee): It definitely is
Pawlitics: I’d be too petrified to work on someone else’s stuff 🙀
Nokri (Marisa): ah, i wish i knew there was a lunch after the shoot tomorrow sooner
Nokri (Marisa): a classmate from high school is going to the philly picnic. she goes to a lot of cons but we never seem to see each other ;~;
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Do both!
Nokri (Marisa): nooooooooo, i don't have anything to bring for the picnic
Bill: Yourself, told you this.
Nokri (Marisa): cannibalism is illegal
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: Bring freaking plates and cups if you have those so where. and if not it doesn't matter.
Nokri (Marisa): people are already bringing those
Nokri (Marisa): i'll cosplay at home and stalk her pictures later
Nokri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can't keep up with all these nwew fashion trends
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Detective pikacheese
Andrew: Oh that Meghan I think was azura from zenkai. Is she asking for cce?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I LOVE HER
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Omg it's IRL Pyrrha
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Y’all someone’s gotta punch me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I meant pinch but ok
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This NASA experience is so good, I’m waiting for someone to be like, “gotcha”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hope it's all good for you. I'm living vicariously through you having a job you actually want and enjoy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL thanks I hope I am making everyone vicariously proud
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oop okay the interns are having a D&D oneshot tomorrow with 6 peeps and somehow I signed up to DM
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oop
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao nice good luck
