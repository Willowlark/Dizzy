N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: I do, I was quick tossing it on before dinner. It does seem to be good quality (my KISS cosplay is basically done) so yeah we can hack at it sometime soon.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): would a messy man bun look better than ponytail? is it possible with that wig?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it has to be a low ponytail or a low bun
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but its possibly
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bossible**
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you get it
Andrew: I'm saving that <@301927856240459777>
