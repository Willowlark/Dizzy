Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): MC is Eevee because she has to choose which ~~boy/Jaehee~~ one she wants
Aldus Larian (Jess): Flashback to me at the park and a girl comming up to me like "i LOVE your jacket" and me not knowing if she knew it was sevens jacket or thought it was an Umbreon jacket
Aldus Larian (Jess): We were nothing playing pogo btw

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That photographer guy wasn‚Äôt weird y‚Äôall
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What a relief
Nokri (Marisa): Did you have a shoot today?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The one that wanted to pay you?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeeee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 400 dollar for two hours
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And got me a water, fan, and ice pop
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And let me draft a contract
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): (He provided one and then was like ‚Äúwhat edits do you want‚Äù)
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE I didn‚Äôt get mugged!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Even tho that scenario sounds like one where I would be!
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): WOAH
Nokri (Marisa): holy fudge that guy is loaded
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Did he take any weird photos?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nope! Nothing freaky
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Normal photos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sit on a rock and smile, stand by a bush and smile
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We got some REALLY nice ones in a bamboo forest
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he showed me every photo after he took it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Was it in cosplay?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Whoa he showed you pictures he took off *you* and not *someone else*?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHOA WHO WOULD HAVE THUNK
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Half a normal black dress I own, half vault suit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nice!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He‚Äôs like late twenties/early thirties I think so I guess he has money to build a cosplay portfolio
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Even signed a thing that he promises not to sell prints of me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which I think is the weirdest thing a photographer could do of me
Nokri (Marisa): the signing thing sounds normal
paying that much to not use the photos in any way aside from a portfolio sounds extremely abnormal
be careful of groomers and whatnot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He said there‚Äôs a photo contest near him he wanted to submit a photo for
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But he would get my approval of the photo first
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He‚Äôs never to the photography game I think
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Said he‚Äôs trying to build a portfolio for conventions so people have something to reference when deciding to book
Nokri (Marisa): still sounds like one of those "if it's too good to be true it probably is" situation, i'd be wary going forward
Nokri (Marisa): that's like 2 weeks of work money
Nokri (Marisa): ~~sorry if i'm being a killjoy I've just seen far too many grooming situations~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It okay, you just care about me being safe ‚ù§Ô∏è
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I am thankful for a safety Marisa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Marisa is now the Safety Salamander
Nokri (Marisa): if you're under attack, go for the eyes because crushing a human eyeball is as easy as crushing an empty soda can, and if your toe is green that's just a small bacterial infection
