El🆓de Faun (Tom): I got the chicken curry at castle point from them it was good
Bill: Man I’m still salty about the videographer from the rwby shoot. He came up to me and then Georgia and I about doing something later in the day since we ran the shoot and he’d contact Georgia about it, then when Georgia moved her time up he totally forgot about me and I *gave* him my info. 

Like either fuck you for forgetting, or assuming Georgia and I are on the same schedule, or just. Ask Georgia if you want just her. It’s not going to offend me.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Said he intended to shoot with you when talking to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He offered free proposal pics to the Renora that got the promise ring today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nice dude probably just was waiting for you and then forgot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If I hadn’t messaged him he prob would’ve forgotten me too
Aldus Larian (Jess): Its 4:18 and I'm drunk on free alcohol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: Ah, you messaged him? It’s on me then I guess, Though I didn’t realize it I was relying on you for my schedule. Figured he’d be the one to follow up.
Bill: Still sucky but it’s a lesson.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah forgetful guy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Seems eager to make RWBY friends tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He was VERY excited to shoot Renora
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My Ren friend surprised the Nora with a promise ring
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This is her waiting for the other one to show, she was so nervous
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _its sending I promise_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And it turned out super cute
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the photo guy set up his speaker to play boop and got some real good photos
N👌kri (Marisa): “RWBY cosplay tagged you in a post!”
Oh? OwO
N👌kri (Marisa): Oh. owo
Bill: Missed opportunity the.  😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh me too fam
Bill: Where was all this renora stuff going on that sounds awesome. Worth going to check out.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Don't let Ethan find out. He might make a callout post on them for stealing his idea
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yikes
Bill: Oh I had a terrible horrible meme idea.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oof Scott
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Scotti boi
N👌kri (Marisa): Most likes of all time <:woah:543194447345876998> the AnimeNEXT tag after a con is so strong
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): con tags are great!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *realizes i havent posted in months*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **ahhhh**
N👌kri (Marisa): **what are you doing.** ***post***
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **but im proud of nothing**
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N👌kri (Marisa): O jess did we get video of you as MC? Aaaa. I don’t remember, I can film the back of my head if needed. 

Also it’s cool we were kind of on opposite sides of the screen so if there’s a part one of us messed up on, that half of the screen can possibly be swapped out for the other video we took
N👌kri (Marisa): Theoretically
Andrew: Gotta post my pics, Marisa do you want me to send you the pics form my phone? like the poses and whatnot
Andrew: *realizes i did not take many photos* Rip
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh.jess may be sleeping
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Uhoh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I don't think you filmed mc
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Could prob do you or Jess in the wig here and send it over
N👌kri (Marisa): Ooo ye pwease send me photos por favor and I’ll go through mine later tonight or tomorrow 

I put a filter on the videos that can’t be applied afterwards because it’s stupid technology but makes us look anime, I can film jess next time she does MC but it’s just for a super short part so I can do the back of my head for like 2 seconds if she wants the video faster
Andrew: You want a text, messenger, or here?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeee i checked on <@!351471675843411978> and she doing the big sleep
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760> shell prob awaken in an hour
Aldus Larian (Jess): I awaken
Aldus Larian (Jess): No we tdidnt get an mc footage 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh it her!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): hewwo!
Aldus Larian (Jess): H-hewwo?
N👌kri (Marisa): H e w w o ? ! 🙀
N👌kri (Marisa): Everyone back to the con we need a do over
Andrew: on the way now
N👌kri (Marisa): O Andru the stuff can go in whatever’s easiest. Probably a google drive or a zip folder
Aldus Larian (Jess): Back to da con
