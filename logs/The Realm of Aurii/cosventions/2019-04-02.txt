Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeeeee good video
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): did you edit the camera audio to try to reduce background noise?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE I tried to
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think this is the best I’ve synced a video to the music
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yes , thats what makes it so good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the camera audio was a bit difficult to hear at times but I'm sure still easier to hear than loud background noise, but the syncing with the music was v good!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeee I need to invest in a mic
Bill: wow that wig looked terrible.

N🆗ri (Marisa): just got notice that the cosplay stage thing at sakura sunday was moved to 11:45. now that it's later is anyone interested?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what exactly is it?
Bill: Wigs whatever. Leanna on it apparently. It look bad but like. So do i?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _all in favor of creating a “bill stop beating up bill” counter?_
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's the cosplay showcase, which is the thing at 11:45 now which is where you just go on stage for a moment to show off. then later there's the cosplay fashion show at like 1:30 which is where you talk about your costume on stage.

looking at the times alotted for each event, that seems wrong and i might have it backwards so i'm gonna double check
Bill: I mean; it fact. I’m working on it. But fact for now.
Bill: I think you have the events flipped marisa. The year I went the walk on was that afternoon event.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o whoops i did get them backwards. i wouldn't do the showcase i'd be like "i sewed this while waiting for my cake to bake and watching zombieland saga"
N🆗ri (Marisa): Cosplay Fashion Show: The Cosplay Fashion Show at Sakura Sunday is a great way to show off your costume and strut your stuff on a catwalk stage at Sakura Sunday! The MC will introduce each cosplayer, their outfit and series, and give them an opportunity to walk up and down the catwalk, pose a few times and get photographed by the audience. The Fashion Show will also be accompanied by the Asian/video game background music.

Cosplay Showcase: Unlike the Cosplay Fashion Show, the Cosplay Showcase will allow you to share some information about the hobby to the audience. Cosplayers are asked a few questions about how they put their outfit together and what cosplay means to them, etc. They don't need elaborate answers. It is more just to give a tidbit of insider information about what goes into the art form.
Dizzy: The bill-dragging-bill count is now 1!

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Or am I being overly critical
N🆗ri (Marisa): YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm trying to look up references and I'm having that issue where every picture is a different color 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe a little darker if you want? most pictures seem to be darker unless he's in the sunlight but it's also good as-is?
N🆗ri (Marisa): **you're literally haku tho**
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm gonna try to darken it before sakura, you've convinced me
