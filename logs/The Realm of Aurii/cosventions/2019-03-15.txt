Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo!

Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz you care about us whoo
Bill: When’s that ever been in question lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Targeted ads stop targeting me
N🆗ri (Marisa):

N🆗ri (Marisa): government no spying
government no spying
government no spying
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AT CPAC AHH
N🆗ri (Marisa): I KNOW RIGHT
N🆗ri (Marisa): why they gotta do this to us
Bill: 🤔
Bill: Part of me wants to get a gym uniform ~~and then a uniform top hoodie that’s larger in case the top doesn’t fit cause ha lol~~ But I also hate “athletic” wear?
Bill: But I could return it, since amazon...
N🆗ri (Marisa): my old coworker had one and used it as pajamas he said it was really comfy
N🆗ri (Marisa): he was gonna be deku for halloween but then was like "i can't wear my pajamas outside i feel weird"
Bill: Not that Mirio wears the gym uniform ~~for long~~.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nakie
Bill: But I figure easier to move around in when shooting.
Bill: Please realize what you are suggesting.
N🆗ri (Marisa): actually isn't it weird mirio boudoir hasn't been a thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): or the one person who cosplays nude mirio. you'd think someone would have done it by now
Bill: Maybe after the new season.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooo did they not do that yet in the anime
but plenty of people read the manga
Bill: Or it already happened and I didn’t see.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Saw I gained a follower and it was a bot but I lost 5 others lol
Bill: Lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): WUT
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm a fight Instagram
N🆗ri (Marisa): We gotta bring it down again
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t blame them <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I got tattoo paper for Emma so I can just put that on easily at zenkai. I’m gonna do maid Blake Friday and Emma most of Saturday.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think I have tattoo paper of you want me to print for u!
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:woah:543194447345876998>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is ok I splurged earlier and bought it with the book!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo ok!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tatoo paper is v.nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee very easy. I used it for neon’s arm tattoo and it saved so much time
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does it come off of you easy?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah a bit of soap and water and some scrubbing
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whenever Tom uses it it takes forever for him to get it off
Aldus Larian (Jess): But when I used it it came off easy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I use a makeup remover wipe
N🆗ri (Marisa): Really? :0
When I did neon it was Friday or Saturday of the con and I just did her for half the day so I wiped it off before doing whatever I did next
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea das what I use
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Naked vault boy when
N🆗ri (Marisa): S c r u b
N🆗ri (Marisa): If anyone knows anybody really tall who ever does a Gentle cosplay and needs a La Brava pls contact me
N🆗ri (Marisa): Or if someone does la Brava I will wear stills and be their gentle
Bill: Again realize what you are suggesting people.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👀
Bill: STILTS
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Hey guys”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow I can't believe Jacques Schnee made it into BNHA
Bill: Gentle is great you stop.
Bill: He looks terrible in that picture though.
Bill: One Mirio.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It'sa me! Mirio!
Bill: Have a shirt that was way too small that’s only mostly too small for underneath that’s. Preferable? To the baggy dress shirt I had at ANYC?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea prob for being animu
Bill: And V. Pins help with sweater.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The Catholic medal ties the look together 👌🏻
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo biru don't wanna borrow my V necklace?
Bill: I assume that’s do you, what V wear?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's just like a rectangular medal
Bill: *Be nice if this dieting thing was actually working cause closet cosplay shouldn’t be this hard on a unlimited budget...*
Bill: But also on the flip side I had forgot how baggy the damn uniform pants are for Mirio.
Bill: Can’t win either way.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's just a square thing
Bill: If it’s a non descript necklace I’ll probably just run with my medals. Yeee so I’ll wear my medals.
Bill: Still in character.
Bill: Will make sure to take sunglasses out of car so I can blind myself.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Okey dokey, I ha e to pack other necklaces anyway so it's no prob
Bill: Oh if you’re wearing jewelry in boudoir don’t forget that, <@!334090409389195266> <@!301927856240459777> too. (Read in how to shoot boudoir that’s a reminder you’re supposed to give)
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just covered in expensive gold
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Jewelry.... didnt even think of that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): RIP
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom has to wear jewelery lol but Ive got it covered
Bill: ~~I assumed you did gurl~~
Bill: 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have a colar that says "meow" of you guys want use it lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): For seven?
N🆗ri (Marisa): The jewelry
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea lol
Bill: My shoes will be inaccurate and I’m not going to care.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Shrink your feet u can borrow mine
Bill: Not getting some ill fitting boots for my flat feet last minute and then trapsing around in bushes and climbing on shit in them for photos.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao but that's so in character
Bill: No.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but but
Bill: No.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ever since Jess said she was on a wine buzz, I've been reading her messages in drunk Jess voice 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao what is drunk jess voice plz explain
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom says i dont sound drunk XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): he did say "hi my name is jess, i get my happiness from the sun and wine"
Bill: He's an adorable Jess.
Aldus Larian (Jess): too accurate
Bill: *pouncing sounds*
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:rated_lewd:391242351198339093>
Bill: Huh.
Bill: Are we uh. Shooting. MM.
Bill: Cause we'd need someone else to do that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): uhhh we'd need to find someone
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeee
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I can... do a video
N🆗ri (Marisa): What happening?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I have a gimbol and a moderately ok phone camera
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Or an attachment for a gopro
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Bill: I mean sure, but also photos.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~Which I'm prob gonna try to do anyway~~
Bill: Mawisa will be staffing, Hunter is Hunter, Rebecca idk?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait what happening is the chat not loading for me or something whatcha talking about
Bill: Zeikani doesn’t do Zenkai, David isn’t going.
Bill: Mystic messenger. Sunday. As you know.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can get an hour break depending on what it is and when
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo
Bill: I can’t photograph it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Selfies
Bill: True.
N🆗ri (Marisa): If I can get a break I’d do it but Sunday busiest day rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone needs to take pics of biru taking pics
Aldus Larian (Jess): and other stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): Use the camera timer
Bill: Possible. I don’t usually carry tripod tho.
Bill: ~~it’s dead weight at a con~~
Bill: Um. I think Rebecca the only option, barring Mawisa being freed from the evil staffers.
Bill: ~~calls up LTD~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I should get a lunch break or something but I don’t know when
Bill: OH WAIT.
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s on staff too <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Flora said she’d do a shoot for me since I’m shooting her thing Saturday.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Flora takes good pics!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): She’s done my Uraraka and my Chise
Bill: I mean, she also rookie photographer (her words) and turning into a group shoot is like oof to do to a photographer but.
Aldus Larian (Jess): selfie time!
Aldus Larian (Jess): we can ask rebecca, but is actual mons for 1 and for 2 i know erik might not wanna do that
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~omg i need to find lingerie for mc o keep forgetting~~
Bill: Oh tru. Teh awk.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh also biru remind me to but you dinner and dranks one night ok
Bill: Oh thank. Probably easier to do that not at the con tho.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I honestly don't care if Rebecca takes photos
Aldus Larian (Jess): das fine too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~because there's a camera lens separating us~~
Bill: But also 45 dollars. ~~I’m a bad person but maaaaaybe I feel that expensive~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh is that what she's charging?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeeeee
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I forgot she actually started charging
Bill: ~~yes I’ve spent 150+ dollars today on a whim,  still expense~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I guess I was getting the special crush discount
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i bought a $14 glass of wine on accident~~
Bill: I hear its lucrative.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah she just started that
Bill: 14 isn’t that bad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): she did katsu for free for us since new camera
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She's charging what Hunter is charging but I don't think she has as much experience? Or takes it as seriously?
Bill: I wanna see a portfolio of her new camera stuff before I’d pay for a shoot. Also she can’t photoshop me not. You know, me, so it’s like photos of me aren’t worth 45 dollars.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I’d love to see rebecca get more into photography
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Does she have a website?
Bill: I asked her and Hunter and Hunter gave a non answer and Rebecca didn't.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant wait to replicate the worlds most awkward couple selfie with tom
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe georgia could spare some time to take some pics for us? ❤
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She just has her photography account
Bill: Hunter is pretty hit or miss for 45 too... Idk.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I could do it but I can’t promise quality 😭
Bill: ~~I really want to know what people would pay for my shoots but I don't actually want money I just want to use that to value it and compare myself to others~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i've never paid for a shoot except the group shoot and im cheap af
Aldus Larian (Jess): id prob not wanna spend more than 30 for a shoot... and that would be the only shoot i do all con
Bill: You started cosplay with me shooting, you never had to consider cost of shoots. Make sense.
Aldus Larian (Jess): cons are just like so expensive as is. I would honestly only pay for couple shoots cuz singles id just have tom do if i had to pay :/
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk if that sounds dickish
Bill: It's not dickish, it who you are. I can't really imagine you wanting to drop a hundred bucks on photos for instagram, it's not why you cosplay.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sakura's BNHA group shoot was a steal with how many people were involved though
Bill: I meant more general than 'how much would *you here* pay' 😛
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH yea def
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And then there's the photog bron the Thursday Darling shoot who charged $20 per person 🙄
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): its really hard for me to say a price cuz like i dont wanna undervalue your work but also it is a hobby
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe like 25?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I pay between $40 and $50 for shoots
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Is that what you would pay or what you think I'd get business with? xP
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah you could charge that
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s average
Bill: 40~50 is the average.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I personally have a problem charging friends for stuff? like design work ive done for friends i dont charge for
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~well it's more on the lower end now with $150 shoots~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): the most ive charged a friend was $30 for like 4hrs work
Bill: I'm not actually debating charging.
Bill: ~~I just wanna know what I could get away with so I can find out if it's more than Hunter/Rebecca~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): $600
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz i dont need thier money i have a job and most my friends dont have the money to be paying me?
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no i know im just giving me own perspective.
Aldus Larian (Jess): also i wont pay the 45 for either of them so
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was getting paid more for my student job at rowan than i am now so i was able to afford it then lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You give back a lot more photos than most paid photogs so I'd go with at least $40-45
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah $40-50 gets me 4-6 photos in return
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Bill: Returns would warrant me a pretty high cost tbh.
Bill: But it's more about quality.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what sam does is give me a sheet of photos she picks out that she thinks are good, then asks me to pick 6 out of 20 or so images. you could do that if you charged
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo yea thats a good way to do it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I wish more photogs did that. They're have been times I posed for a photo and didn't get that one back and kind of wanted it
N🆗ri (Marisa): that emcp guy who got called out did that do but he sent me like decent resolution images of every single picture so i saved them all 👀 sam just does thumbnails. i can show u if you swear to keep it secret
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I wish hunter did that specifically
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): We did so many pyrrha shots when we did the cosplay switch
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I only ever saw one
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess if you want all of your unedited nora pics let me know
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He said the others werent to his standards... which is fine.. but I wouldve liked to at least see them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, the cuddle photo from summer lovin' he sent me as like a preview *through FB messenger* and then never posted the higher res in his photo dump
N🆗ri (Marisa): ??
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo das up to u, i wont complain to have them but i dont wanna be a bother
N🆗ri (Marisa): and yeah that makes no sense how he never gives you guys the pictures?
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you want you can have them! i know my editing isn't great
N🆗ri (Marisa): i send
Aldus Larian (Jess): oog facebook KILLS
Aldus Larian (Jess): i sent tom a 2000px image and he for it at 400px
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hunter also *really* needs a better way of giving you his photos
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hate the photo dump in the server
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea thats terrible
Aldus Larian (Jess): biru wins on that
Aldus Larian (Jess): like they are all on his site and his flickr
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hunter needs to make a website with albums
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like bill
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Because yikes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yes
N🆗ri (Marisa): or at least use wetransfer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Especially if he's planning on taking this more seriously
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hes like VERY serious about photography...  so you gotta be more professional with your photo returns
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You can't give people their photos back through Facebook messenger
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 1. It's not professional
2. It kills the resolution
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea wetransfer and dropbox are way better options
Aldus Larian (Jess): even fucking google photos
Aldus Larian (Jess): or email
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah if he really cuts the number of photos send them through email
N🆗ri (Marisa): 68 single pics headed your way jess
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pwease:555585508819075112>  bless
Bill: There's a term for those shoot thumbnail pages like that.
Bill: I forget what it is.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's been on "5 seconds remaining" for at least a minute <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I do pretty professional by just being a type A personality.
Bill: I definitely win on returns, but it's quality I'm trying to compare via money.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Erik what a mood I always wonder what happens to photos I was hyped about
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Especially with hunter
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia do u want all unedited photos too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I got like two things from that whole day of shootin
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O nah Marisa you sent me so many already I appreciate it
N🆗ri (Marisa): they here if u need 'em
Bill: And I shouldn't compare myself either.
Bill: It's not good.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 155 of them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You sent me like 40
Aldus Larian (Jess): im like a photo hoarder
Aldus Larian (Jess): i really liked using google photos album (for phone pics), did that work for you ok <@!301927856240459777> ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!! that was cool, but it took me days to upload my phone photos for you. i don't know why. it'd keep crashing or say "uploading" and then not do anything for an hour, until i finally uploaded everything one at a time
N🆗ri (Marisa): if it worked better and i had more drive space i'd use it more
N🆗ri (Marisa): but is super convenient thank
N🆗ri (Marisa): "about 2 minutes remaining"
what happened to the five seconds
Aldus Larian (Jess): if is too much of a pain don't worry about it
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah i think it sent
N🆗ri (Marisa): it said 100 and then i x'd it out so i hope so <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I GOT IT
Aldus Larian (Jess): bless u
Bill: anyway not to spook anyone. I'm bad at valuing my own work and 'how much could I charge' is a theoretically way to do it.
Bill: *I actually do think I'm good tho*
Bill: ~~Better than Rebecca~~

~~Better than Hunter, most of the time~~
Bill: 🌶 opinions
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think rebecca has a lot of raw talent but none of the tech or the know-how that comes with age
Aldus Larian (Jess): id say you all have different strengths and styles
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’d love to see where she is in a couple years
Aldus Larian (Jess): photography is an art, and theres no one way to do art "the best"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I like the dynamic nature of Hunter’s photos, how they tell a story, and he’s got a good idea of people’s best angles
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But a lot of the artsy photo ideas aren’t great for Instagram (the proposal photo), they’re usually very dark, and low returns
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Everybody’s got their thing
Bill: ~~I'm replacing love and appreciation with wanting photos from me okay gawd~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _billiam no_
N🆗ri (Marisa): hey biru you wanna do lots of photoshoots with everyone? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I agree that everyone's got different strengths
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah that’s the most of it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like Bill's really got at getting well lit shots
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hunter is good with dynamic shots and storytelling
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rebecca is pretty good at getting good angles
N🆗ri (Marisa): im the ceasar salad of saturation
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ALL THE SATURATIOB
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa is good at making people feel comfortable and has good posing ideas! i also like her saturation of colors cuz anime
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru's photos are all so detailed and fancy
N🆗ri (Marisa): just channel ur inner anime that's how you pose
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Marisa’s commentary really is the best omg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, I actually really love the angle on this shot from Rebecca (but I'm not fond of the lighting because it was in the shade)
N🆗ri (Marisa): what happened to mr obama
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I personally also like the saturation too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That looks like such a well posed shot
Aldus Larian (Jess): i love Rebecca's angles, birus realism
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think rebecca also shouldn’t be afraid to slow down her return time
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive never done a shoot with hunter so idea
N🆗ri (Marisa): hunter sounds like a cryptid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Good with posing ideas?* I need to shoot with Mawisa sometime OwO
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u just channel ur inner anime
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _ma... wis... aaaaaaa_
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~she will also cheer u on the whole time~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah I think Rebecca rushes to get photos back
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s like “WERK it you’re beautiful”
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I’m like oh thank I am a beautiful dirt covered wastelander
N🆗ri (Marisa): next person to shoot with me will secretly reenact all of Natsuiro Egao de 1 2 jump through poses
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't know what she even edits in then other than slapping a credit in the corner
N🆗ri (Marisa): im curious about that too she said she was editing at katsu
someone peer over her shoulder constantly until she edits stuff again
Aldus Larian (Jess): she prob just does some autosetting?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She edits out blemishes too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She hid the hole in my Pyrrha glove
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo nicu
Bill: But I wanna be good at angles and stories too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): best shot thursday of katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): for angles makes everything diagonal
Bill: ~~Being good at realism is actually fitting, considering that requires technical savvy and I'm a technical guy~~
Bill: I do the tilt all the time.
N🆗ri (Marisa): does anybody have a seesaw
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah realism was the word I was looking for
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which is a good strength
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru u take really good realism photos ya. the rest of us scrubs overly rely on photoshop
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna do a seesaw shoot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk how to describe hunters photos other than like... geometrically pleasing
Aldus Larian (Jess): balanced?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): balanced like a seesaw
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like the eye easily follows me and Casey here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We make a lil triangle
Aldus Larian (Jess): balance ⚖
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This one balanced too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Bill: Composition.
Bill: That's the word you're looking for
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Illuminati confirmed
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bill does it too tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Doxxed
Bill: He apparently only uses live view in shoots, which probably helps with that.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): B A L A N C E
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg Erik
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Can I post that to my story
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol sure
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ***balance***
N🆗ri (Marisa): we should try a thing where we just follow people around with cameras and take pictures
N🆗ri (Marisa): stories can be told that way
N🆗ri (Marisa): like
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): these tell forbidden tales
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Those are so cute
Andrew: I look stoned. Also wig does not like the mask
N🆗ri (Marisa): HELMET
N🆗ri (Marisa): spikey wig!!! like a porcupine with quills
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): What is mask attached with? If it has straps can you put it on first then the wig?
Andrew: It is attatched with ropes around tghe ears
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Also btw that looks really good! Idk what it's from but its lit
N🆗ri (Marisa): lobster man!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OHHHH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's spot on
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Good fucking job
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just as a testament to Hunter's improvement over the past year, this is where he was at last Katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): just like a real prom photo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea wow he really has been improving a lot
N🆗ri (Marisa): my one regret in life is not being able to get this picture from the front but i did get the callum's social media contacts the next day
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omgggg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YOOOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a decent one of the ezran and callum together but it's in another folder
N🆗ri (Marisa): they were so perf
N🆗ri (Marisa): and i don't think it was planned they just happened to perfectly have a rayla, ezran, and callum
Andrew: thank ye all,  now i need to try makeup to make my face more photogenic
Andrew: along with wig work, but it prob wont be that spikey
Andrew: Does zenkai have a formal?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yasss
N🆗ri (Marisa): also yassss

Andrew: I do not have a tux, could do soldier jacket with a tie?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): If we cant figure out a time for boudoir I can always do it another time with you Mawisa!
N🆗ri (Marisa): no they wouldn't let you in with that sorry, you gotta have formal clothes. lizzy is a sticker for it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oki! 👌

N🆗ri (Marisa): i could bring jaehee but idk if i have any free time sunday
N🆗ri (Marisa): it'd be in character
Aldus Larian (Jess): TRUE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Assistant Kang, please make sure that the convention is running smoothly
N🆗ri (Marisa): goes and buys zen's latest CD in the dealer's hall
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have to go make sure MC is still doing alright ~~in the cage~~ in my apartment
Bill: > *knocks on door down the hall*
> "Hunter, we know you brought a cage to Zenkai, can we borrow it?"
> Hunter yeets dog crate out door
Aldus Larian (Jess): im sure we can find some bars in lancaster XD
Bill: oh so now it's public bondage.
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is so cool
Bill: it took me a minute.
Bill: Nice edit.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ohhhhh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that is really cool
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow that took longer than it should have
Aldus Larian (Jess): nicuu
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d0/db/c6/d0dbc643a5bf082878ab44abbe3e8572.jpg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Guess I need to learn cross stitching
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is that zwei
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no it's a cat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 🐱
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHH that one of my favs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh
Bill: So to discuss photos more ~~cause I'm sure you're not sick of that~~, the photo Hunter did that Gen posted today?
Bill: I would have never done that shot. Just cause there's no faces.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think its a really cool shot,not a good place to do it though
Bill: Which I guess is storytelling, but if I wanted to focus on the weapons and flask with them in the background I'd prop the weapons up better.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): weapons shouldve been propped against a rock or something
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like...outdoors
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): with better lighting
Bill: Tis not a bad shot at all. I just looked at it and was like 'I'd have never done that'.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its a good shot, just ....weird where he did it
Aldus Larian (Jess): that goes back to style differences too
Bill: Like I thought the one with the strq photo was fantastic.
Bill: Really well done.
Bill: This is like... the shitty sequel to the blockbuster movie?
Bill: not shitty, but. Like. Shrek 2 versus Shrek.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _you knockin shrek 2?_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how dare you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think a better shot would have been the weapons and flask propped up and easier to see, and then they would stand further back (like a lot further back) so their full bodies were in the shot, but out of focus
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): human shrek is best shrek
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~also....not in..that hallway, it looks like a sterile hospital hallway~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea outside would be nicer
Bill: That could be part of his story?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): doubtful
Bill: Ruby in hospital, Winter shows up to comfort Qrow?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hes a stickler for making it obvious what the story is, i feel like this was a last minute shot idea
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): before he had to get to another shoot
Bill: More likely cosplayers don't tend to care about the backdrop and he was already done ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it looks like a test shot of an idea he had
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that came out better than he expected so he returned it to gen
Bill: lol though, I probably publish a test shoot every single gallery. If not more than one.
Bill: Cause two weeks later when I'm going through the raws to choose what my album looks like, I don't fucking remember which were tests and which weren't.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah idk it’s not optimized well for Instagram either
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And you can’t really admire the details of the cosplay
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or the propas
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its a redo of the bees photo you and casey did
Bill: ye, the details are why I would never do that shot.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but not as well executed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://www.instagram.com/p/BqF_LzNndj0/
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://www.instagram.com/p/BvB1ilmD567/
Bill: Hunter's skill points just go up when bees are involved.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): youre not wrong
Bill: Does anyone have that cosplay skill rating story that was going around.
Bill: I wanna see if there's a photographer one.
Bill: ~~there won't be~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whats that : o
Bill: the story post. People filled in their sewing skill, uh... foam, other stuff.
Bill: and rated how good they are at stuff.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooh yea, reminded me of my resume
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): right i wanted to do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): make a photographer one!
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow biru who's that cosplayer in your new post <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: SHE BEAUTIFUL AND I LOVE HER
Aldus Larian (Jess): BEST GURL
N🆗ri (Marisa): Who Is She™
N🆗ri (Marisa): the girl reading this <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's such a good idea for a hagakure cosplay that's a mannequin or something.
like:
todoroki wezrez
mina whoozica
hagakure the girl reading this
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Shrek2>shrek1
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also <@301927856240459777>  I'm trying to play spot the difference with those photos and I'm just not seeing kt
N🆗ri (Marisa): this one?
Aldus Larian (Jess): the window!
N🆗ri (Marisa): :3
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I saw it right after I said it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Riparoni
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Idk how that was do hard to see
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But yeah that's really cool
Bill: wait did anyone have the story thing?
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah i didnt save it
N🆗ri (Marisa): i do
Bill: share.
Bill: I wanna check the creator.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i checked them i think only this and one other game was on their page
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh bless up it's a super clean version
N🆗ri (Marisa): i should do this <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pwease:555585508819075112>  has so much more blessed energy than 🙏
N🆗ri (Marisa): is bless up the opposite of turn down
Bill: Oof all the work to photoshop a photographer one.
Bill: And also figuring out skills.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o just make one from scratch
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Camera
Gear
Maintenance
Lighting
Composition
Angles
Posing
Editing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What’s maintenance?
N🆗ri (Marisa): painting fences and replacing lightbulbs and stuffs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, proper caring for your camera and gear I guess
Bill: Gear isn’t a skill tho. It’s how much money do you spend.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~Gear~~ money in tha bank $$$
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean, it could include additional accessories that require skill to learn to use properly like lighting kits and whatnot
Bill: I got these... ```Composition
Exposure
Large Groups
Natural Light
Flash/Artificial Light
Posing
Editing
Photoshop```
Bill: Camera kinda makes sense, it was definitely a limitation of Rebecca's, but she was limited by not owning it. Wouldn't want to alienate peeps for being broke.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): composition?
Bill: Oh it was on there.
Bill: didn't copy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): woop
Bill: Fixed.
Bill: Oof making the story would take me like an hour at least and I gotta workkkk
Bill: ~~except I've stared at this bug for like a week straight and I can't focus on it anymore~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): somebody do a big group with me i wanna see what it's like
the last big group of 10+ i did was in 100 degree weather and everybody had on body paint and we were kicked out of our spot by a mean pony cosplayer so everyone was cranky
Bill: No.
Bill: At least not shooting.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no i wanna shoot it
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru u cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): model
Bill: I'd be in a big group for cosplay, but not for shoots. Shooting big groups is hell.
Bill: ~~hella hypocritical~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): last time wasn't so bad except for the heat and melting and mean pony
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg XD
Bill: Mirio definitely coming with me, not sure if I should friday it or saturday night... but yolo.
Bill: Also remembered I have the pilot boi stuff from Katsu before last... I should look at that again later. For the lulz.
Bill: Man. 14 pages of galleries.
Bill: And no way to easily sort through them.
Bill: Wow. I republished some older galleries, so Animenext'17 is the only year with the text watermark.
Bill: *exclusive*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOOO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): exclusive old generation watermark
Bill: life was simpler back then.
N🆗ri (Marisa): A vintage tilt worm, with original watermark and minimal scuff marks. Bidding starts at $75,000.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I finally looked at the Orange Sherbet album and literally every picture is gold
Bill: ~~I probably couldn't get people to hire me for 20 bucks, 75k?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's exclusive
Bill: Orange Sherbet is entirely memes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh and I think I forgot to look at the rest of my Jumin album because I definitely missed this one and holy shit it's so good
https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7817/46616202434_b46aeef312_o.jpg
Bill: oh thank.
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH that uraraka album has like 300+ views on some pictures did we ever figure out ***why***
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeee das a nice jumin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~if only that person weren't in the back tho~~
Bill: wiat what?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): some albums have an uncomfortably huge amount of views
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its cause you cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): NO U
Bill: *it's banned*
Bill: Did you share it to facebook or something, where family would look at it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): nop
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hide my cosplay shame, albeit incredibly poorly to the extent that everyone on earth knows about it
Bill: Occasionally when I run an upload the photos do get likes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): one of my japanese students sat down for their lesson - first time i've ever met them ever - looks at me and goes "are you cosplayer?"
Bill: I think I have a few followers on flickr, but they're bots.
Bill: *Marisa, in a wig sewing frantically: "no?"*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i follow you!
N🆗ri (Marisa): fwickr
Bill: YE I follow you too!
Bill: Everyone look at Marisa's portfolio she *actually has* unlike *other photographers*!https://www.flickr.com/photos/149364684@N02/albums/72157683894181185

Bill: ~~I’ll never staff a con~~
Bill: Maybe RUN a con.
Bill: Never staff.
Bill: I have issues with authority.
Bill: #leo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like staffing a con takes the fun out of going to the con :/
Bill: Yup.

Bill: You work in your development. Easy.
Bill: ,... What photogs do I know. Or at least know the work of.
Hunter
Zeikani
Rebecca
Clouds
LTD
Jpaded
s1priceworks
Ben

Think that's it.
Bill: Shit Mawisa.
Bill: I'm a dumb.
N🆗ri (Marisa): vaughn photography sucks they never gave me my pics

kaisia, sam, biru, and nancy are my faves
N🆗ri (Marisa): kaisia's disappeared off the face of the earth
Bill: Don't think I know the others. Just Nancy and me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh and wonder!!! her too
N🆗ri (Marisa): wonder also kind of disappeared
N🆗ri (Marisa): nancy is in australia now
Bill: ~~Yo I. Think I'm better than like 90% of the list of photographers I know, comparing work to work. Why do I have confidences issues~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): u are! ⭐
Bill: and the remaining 10% are either equals or not too much better. Like.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LIKE MARISA ❤️
N🆗ri (Marisa): you need to fight them to the death
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm the 90% <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): nancy - wonder - biru - kaisia - sam
N🆗ri (Marisa): the holy quintepta
Bill: *I've taken better photos of you than those girl~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye but is good pic and i got lazy looking for pics through flickr and i like pic
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe dat pic make her feel gud
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's framed over my bed
Bill: That's not even meant to be an insult to others. People can be at different skill levels due to time, it's a fluctuating thing as we learn and grow. I just realized when not comparing people's reactions and stuff, and it's my opinion versus my opinion. I'd rank me better than the others.
Bill: That weird.
N🆗ri (Marisa): fight your own opinion
N🆗ri (Marisa): punch
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): cospway
Bill: mood
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotta make terra's pants. and belt. and put the T on the shirt.
N🆗ri (Marisa): can i get away with using black thread on yellow fabric <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: beeeeeeeesssss
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotta make blake's ears
Bill: how do you not have a drawer full of cat ears by now.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a box
N🆗ri (Marisa): and a cubicle because the box is small and some overflow into the cubicle
N🆗ri (Marisa): but............. Improved Ears
Bill: *I laughed*
Bill: Welcome to NJ.
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> you're watching the weather for a good weekend to go to buttermilk falls right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ya you'd need connections to shoot in good places
Aldus Larian (Jess): uhhh not yet lol
Bill: Whenever it does become relevant. 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wont start till may may probs
Bill: my scarf shoot isn't happening this year.
Bill: er. This winter.
Bill: Next winter is also part of this year, technically
N🆗ri (Marisa): it sucks that wildwood is changing so much and the house is being sold
N🆗ri (Marisa): that was really retro and cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): we still have a ton of connections with nightclubs and restaurants for photoshoots but nowhere to stay
Bill: Aurii goes to the beach for a week. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): DID SOMEONE SAY BEACH
Bill: ~~get more vacation days~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i get 15 july 1
Aldus Larian (Jess): BUT i dont get more money so rip
Bill: *Marisa you have to join the trend*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just got an email that confirms i work the dealer's hall hours and get a one hour meal break each day yehaw
N🆗ri (Marisa): i charge like $5 per person and last time i shot 2 lovely girls they misread it and paid me $5 total and i was like "aight ;u;" i'm too wimpy to enforce my prices
Bill: if you think I charge 20 bucks, you easily can.
Bill: Unless it's Scott.
N🆗ri (Marisa): $5.01
Bill: He has to be 1,472.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow that was a leap year
N🆗ri (Marisa): we're now the smallest security team though
N🆗ri (Marisa): 6 people... so 2 at the front door 2 at the exit and 2 patrolling?
Bill: Can't wait for Marisa to tackle a manga thief.
N🆗ri (Marisa): >:3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): rather than thieves we deal more with stalkers, harassment, and weapons
N🆗ri (Marisa): and lost children. our code for a lost child over the radio is "chibi on the loose"
N🆗ri (Marisa): but more than "i had this item stolen!" it's stuff like....
"this person bought a handmade scarf from me and is reselling it"
"my ex is stalking me here and i think he has a gun"
"we accidentally dyed the lancaster police chief's head pink what do we do" (that was partially my fault)
N🆗ri (Marisa): "this couple has lost their son 6 times already and while i'm explaining this to you i see the son wandering away unsupervised *again*"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so looking at the colorful cast of characters in BNHA, I feel like a fun GB would be Nana
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or Joke
Bill: Joke would be amusing. Nana I always mistake for wonder woman.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nana just looks like a mom wearing dishwashing gloves
Bill: Pretty much.
Bill: BNHA author half assed the female cast so...
Bill: Genderbending is better for the dudes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): RWBY is much better for genderbending
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): either gender
Bill: ~~much better~~
Bill: Two people should do Todoroki, but one half each. So fireroki and snowroki.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that would be cool
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think Joke would be better for CCE because I could make swim trunks that look like her shorts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and have floaties as the wrist things
Bill: Huh. The fem Bakugo trend is short/same hairstyle. I kinda imagined longer hair.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think its cause his mom has short hair
Bill: oh true.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there's one fem Bakugou I follow but it looks like a mullet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof
Bill: The only one.
Bill: ~~Deku translates well to a female character but Bakugo and his relationship would take a serious red flag turn in that AU~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~its a red flag now~~
Bill: Also true.
Bill: They're getting better.
Bill: In the manga.
Bill: || Basically since Bakugo found out about One for All ||
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||deku wasn’t exactly super secret about it with him <:lenny:395307171539189760> ||
Bill: hmm. I wonder if in 10 years BNHA author will come out saying 'the bullying Bakugo did was a mark of the times, if I wrote BNHA now I wouldn't have written it like that'. That's what Sword art guy did with the rape scene in Alicization.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.instagram.com/p/BufFc7knRtf/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1g1z3wkrr62cp
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bakumullet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh oof..... i don't like that wig
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :x
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And that's not saying her cosplay is bad because it's not. It's just now what I would have done...
Bill: idk... Most Bakugo genderswaps just look like Bakugo with tit.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Bill: Fanart and cosplay.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i like the rest of the cosplay though!
Bill: It's what I meant by defining them as separate people.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh yea fem baku art makes me uncomfy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it literally is just bakugo with giant boobs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and like... no other difference
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but my gay side of my headcanon is bakugo would be flat chested as a girl >.>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and super sporty build
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like a soccer chick
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): prob with a long straight hair ponytail
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): as to not let the hair get in the way
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or lit on fire
Aldus Larian (Jess): Headcanon accepted
Bill: YE I was feeling the long straight hair, ponytail too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That cosplay looks somewhat like this hairstyle
Bill: Oh.
Bill: Yeah no that a good fem Bakugo.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): except the sides are pulled back into the ponytail
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee
N🆗ri (Marisa): The hero academia restaurant I went to lit the bakugo themed food on fire it was great
Bill: Fem Bakugo would be be sporty for sure... She'd do the Haruhi thing and change in front of the class and the japanese males would freak out and she'd be too occupied on the class mission.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Bill: if it was just Bakugo flipped, the Deku dynamic could shift to include some 'don't treat me like a girl', Deku grows up and keeps trying to be the white knight she clearly doesn't want and she straight up hates him for belittling her.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oooo i really like this one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://kawaiikrisschan.tumblr.com/post/170687033805
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...the second pic
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Bill: She's not tsundere either, cause that's how any japanese author would write it. She's got a chip on her shoulder and she wants to stand on her own two feet as top hero, and anyone who thinks she'd be safer off the front lines will get blasted and moved past. Deku being, in the finale, the last person she has to beat. Deku finally fights her all out, Bakugo wins, Deku like 'was it this easy to be your friend this whole time' and she like *spits blood* 'yeah fucking deku.'.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye, she just angry not tsundere
Bill: Shame japanese media is shit at portraying ~~women~~ characters of depth.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you're not wrong..... ~~that's why i tend not to like anime very much~~
Bill: People call him tsundere now, but if they did tsundere with him as a girl?
Bill: It would dominant her personalty.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i was considering joining the gb bnha thing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, i really only care about baku
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): rip
Bill: You can still do Baku tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean i can
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's a mood Leanna I totally get that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i dont wanna seem like im stepping on rebeccas toes xD
Bill: fem Baku!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she'd prob be fine with it
Bill: BNE does not do 1 of groups.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but hhhhh anxiety
Bill: and if anyone tries I will voice opposition to it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye only only I'd wanna do is Todo. But I'm not big on genderbends for me personally I think? Idk
Bill: It's not inclusive.
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a cosplayer thing that people often don’t want to cosplay the same character as anyone else in a group because then each cosplayer feels like they’re stealing the other’s thunder or the other one is way better
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like i already did regular bakugo... but i cant exactly do crossplay for CCE >.>
Bill: that's fine, as long as it's your decision and not a rule of the gorup.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m not in support of one person only exclusive groups but I’m just saying that’s a big part of it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, like i got the feeling they were trying to get as many characters as possible
Bill: It's not going to be a big group I don't think...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i considered doing kirishima
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Bill: I don't trust anyone outside of Georgia/Rebecca to follow through.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bakugo is really the only one id put effort into
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve already got most of my iida cosplay done tho ;u;
Bill: Oh I forgot you were doing Iida.
Bill: Sorry Marisa.
Bill: You are of course reliable.
Bill: I was thinking of other BNE members.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ded
Bill: Though I can't remember which ones talked about getting involved.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh dang my discord avatar disappeared I really am dead
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): anna was interested
N🆗ri (Marisa): Everyone I think at least chipped in. Fed Anna
Bill: Anna would require quit a bit of pestering to keep her on track I think.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Iida would be my second choice but yea idk my opinion on GBs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i feel you, i prefer just crossplaying ngl
N🆗ri (Marisa): O jess do you wanna do iida
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): for myself, not like a generalization
Bill: ye.
N🆗ri (Marisa): You can be iida
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): From what I saw, it was mostly Rebecca, Anna, and Georgia
Aldus Larian (Jess): Na u iida
Bill: Georgia loving being her own husbando, Rebecca seems motivated by groups, Anna encourages *everything*.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I suck tho you better
Bill: Marisa cosplayed everything already.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Anna was planning on doing Present Mic
Bill: ye.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I suck tho you better
Bill: With Mag as Aizawa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I meant for the GB group
N🆗ri (Marisa): Im gonna stab Biru happy ides of March everybody
Bill: yeah that's what I thought they meant for.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think she said anything about Mag going but I'm guessing she'll probably be at CCE too
Bill: Go ahead.
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’ll be non fatal tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): Stab in the hair
Bill: oh wait, non fatal?
Bill: Never mind.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It too early to plan for CCE for me
Bill: ^
Bill: ~~not that I have to plan anything~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): If you wanna be iida really badly I can find another character
Bill: YOU ARE IIDA
Bill: END OF STORY.
N🆗ri (Marisa): No u
Bill: RAWR XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol so random xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk even know what I'm doing for Saturday afternoon for zenkai yet 😂
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg my emo phase just came back to me like a fever dreaAM
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thanks bill
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): RAWR XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): 10 year cosplay plan
Bill: Nejire, cause then I'll actually make a decision on when to wear Mirio.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I bought a sweet tooth badysuit that can also double as a bathing suit so I'm gonna wear that for some character I haven't figured out yet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): : o
Bill: ~~big titty goth nora?~~

Aldus Larian (Jess): Lemme see
Bill: ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): The sides aren’t as long as they were advertised to be but that can be fixed. It’s just super light.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: It Terra!
Aldus Larian (Jess): its good!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yo what happened to the sweet city reflection in my totally real sunglasses
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hmm <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s light like the princess in aldnoah zero
Bill: Yo I hated her.
Aldus Larian (Jess): IT GOOD
Aldus Larian (Jess): good wog
Bill: Much wog such wow.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): why u guys bein so nice u gotta be HARSH and CRITICAL in this cruel world
Bill: I'm harsh and critical.
Bill: Particularly when you say "no u".
N🆗ri (Marisa): Photoshop wig darker  <:pew:543202259085950996>  genius
Bill: Adding saturation will actually blonde the wig more.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Because saturation fixes everything

Bill: But seriously is it recognizable enough.

Bill: ~~So anyone as bad as me~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): theres alot of them

Bill: A helmet might help but that's like, 60 more dollars to a cosplay I alright bought for like, 150~200 and never worn that's a meme at best.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do it for the vine
N🆗ri (Marisa): is everyone's instagram interaction down? ruby is doing much worse than ray time to quit instagram and join the circus
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea mines seemed down lately

Bill: ~~if I do Mirio friday I have an entire lineup~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😮 whoa!
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats awesome!
Bill: But still not sure if I want Mirio friday. It's what, Erik doing BNHA and that's it?
