Bill: It's a weird compliment but I think of the actor when I see her. She looks so canon not, like. is a dude.
Bill: One with Leanna and everything's backed up and decidedly not a now thing.

Andrew: unrelated meme
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ohhh yea kryssma wigs are hella nice too, I use them every chance i get because the hair is really realistic looking and not shiny
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Probably better than ardas 83 dollar price tag
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Arda lacefronts have super hard lace too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They tend to stick up unless you glue them down
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like really well
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Cause the lace is stiff
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The hair quality is nice though. But not 80 dollars nice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah Arda is so expense man Idk how people regularly get their lacefronts
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea dude I have no idea
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Sometimes area is worth it for the extra wefts in the wigs... but the lacefronts are sooooo expensive for no reason
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The lace is only like 1 inch wide
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Arda is good if you need a thick wig or want to do a lot of heavy styling. But for thor and the braids the Amazon wig you posted has a more lace width and has a more natural hairline than the arda one and is like a third of the cost
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I like ardas short wigs cause they‚Äôre nice and easy to style
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea! The short ones are really good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And not too expensive
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Non lacefront long ones are pretty ok too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I dont have one of the longer nonlace ones but from what I've seen they look pretty good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But they kinda expensive too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye that‚Äôs my yang and star wigs
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Five wits is where I try to buy my wigs from go
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Five wits is gr9
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I talked to one of the owners at Zenkai
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs just a woman and her wife running it out of their house
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Awww
