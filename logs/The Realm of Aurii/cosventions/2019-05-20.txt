Nokri (Marisa): cosplay armor sucks. i'm sad and in pain and only know what i'm doing in theory.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no! ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): all the armor i've made before has been smaller in scale, like knee/leg/arm/shoulder/skirt parts
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive never made armor D:
Nokri (Marisa): it's time
Nokri (Marisa): suit up jess
Aldus Larian (Jess): ðŸ˜±
Andrew: armor is fun
Andrew: thats about all ive made
Nokri (Marisa): it's like sewing but you can't sew it so it sucks
you have to use glue
Andrew: lots of glue
Nokri (Marisa): but i have to be careful as well that the seams aren't visible in certain sections and that the glue doesn't rub off on the outfit underneath if it gets hot. which it definitely will
Nokri (Marisa): i usually paint both the inside and outside but i think this time i'm only going to paint the outside
the pauldron will be the only piece painted on both sides and i need to find good sealer for it
Andrew: they coming along well?
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): im still patterning it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is there anything planned for next Sunday?

Glonk: <@184437198865563648> just a heads up, I'm not going to be in the otakon and colossal room list this year
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok coo my friend wants me to help her pick out s dress for a wedding
Bill: I knew otakon, shame about CCE. Okay.

Bill: <@!228287793099440128> you're doing Next?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm debating going but probably not because
1. my sister's wedding is the following weekend so not sure if we have other shit that needs to get done
2. I'm so burnt out from weekend adventures ðŸ˜©
Bill: Yeah Anext is light for the 'bne' members as a whole.
Bill: Those of us who go have been going for a long time.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if I go to AC I'd rather just go to the beach
Bill: CCE is 11 people now then.
Bill: Otakon I have no fucking clue.
Bill: Probably not enough to keep both rooms tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): eh, its not exactly "light"
Bill: No, not as bad as I thought.
Nokri (Marisa): is swolfy going???????? she's listed as going on the facebook event page
Bill: But saturday still going to get pricey without you two in the cut.
Bill: She doesn't stay with us.
Nokri (Marisa): ***but is she going***
Nokri (Marisa): i've never met swolfy
Nokri (Marisa): there's no proof at the moment she isn't a figment of my imagination
Bill: She's coming to your party iirc.

Bill: Right there next to Dave.
Nokri (Marisa): my party's gonna SUCK how could anyone go to that
Glonk: Yes, I'm there for next
Bill: kk.
Nokri (Marisa): we were gonna do bar style trivia at some point but we can't think of a prize
Nokri (Marisa): my idea was a takeout container to take more food home <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Prize should be a hug from Mawisa-chan.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Marisa's party is gonna be lit ðŸ˜Ž
Nokri (Marisa): it's gotta be a prize not a punishment
Bill: what if they're a masochist?
Bill: That masophobic(?)!
Nokri (Marisa): we might have an underage kid in the parking lot directing traffic for some reason, pls don't run them over
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bar-style trivia includes beer right? <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): water <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): soda?

Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): MARISA
Nokri (Marisa): we'll probably have soda but i'm not in charge of that because i only drink water

Aldus Larian (Jess): can I bring anything to your party?
Nokri (Marisa): WAHT

Bill: Birthday presents/graduation presents/existing presents/appreciation of meme presents...
Bill: Am I forgetting anything.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): belated Hanukkah presents
Bill: ^
Nokri (Marisa): im gonna wear my senior prom dress because i can eyyy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ðŸ‘€
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): can we all dress up nice then
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause thats fun and i want an excuse
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!! the dress code according to the facebook page is literally anything you want as long as you're covered
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fancy friends
Nokri (Marisa): lemme go find the specifics
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so, in theory, could i cover myself in craft american cheese singles
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ðŸ¤”
Nokri (Marisa): WAIT WHAT THE MASQUERADE WALK ONS ARE OPEn??

yeah!!! that is possible!!
Nokri (Marisa): oh i think it's walk-ons for performing...? not the hall contest....??? ??
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): for what? anext?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is the party indoors or outdoors?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah, meg just applied for a masquerade walk-on but the hall contest applications are still closed so i think she applied for a masquerade skit by herself wow
Nokri (Marisa): ||
Dress code:
Whatever your heart desires within reason. You can wear a fancy gown or a sequin-covered tuxedo. You can come in your pajamas. You can roll up looking like you just wrestled your way out of the Amazon Rainforest after being trapped under a boulder for five days, or you can dress up like Maka in chapter 111 of Soul Eater when she fights the kishin on the moon. If you have an outfit youâ€™ve wanted to wear but never had the opportunity, this is your chance. Just ensure you have a shirt, shoes, and leg covering of some kind and we wonâ€™t have any problems, capiche?||
Nokri (Marisa): whoops
Aldus Larian (Jess): masquerade at mawisas party!
Nokri (Marisa): indoors! there is a pool outdoors but strangers will probably be using it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok so Red Riot Thot. Got it
Glonk: Swolfy is going to next only for Saturday
Nokri (Marisa): i like how my name is in the title of the event and people still spell my name wrong. that's basically my life right there
Nokri (Marisa): SWOLFY IS GOING TO ANEXT!!!
Glonk: But as Bill said, you'll see her at your party
Nokri (Marisa): i'm scared and awed
Nokri (Marisa): i couldn't stand the guilt of making someone do something they don't want to so y'all don't have to come if you don't want to or if you'd rather do something else
i don't think we'll have goodie bags
Nokri (Marisa): and i'm making most of the food
Aldus Larian (Jess): we wanna come! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): were so proud of you so we want to come and celebrate with you!

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _ill print that badge and wear it_

Elfriede Faun (Tom): You have contact cement?
Nokri (Marisa): Wot <:woah:543194447345876998> 
No :0
Nokri (Marisa): Why do I need contact cement
Nokri (Marisa): OH Iâ€™m not using foam for this part
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh okay
Elfriede Faun (Tom): What's the armour made of?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Your supposed to make the armour out of 100 percent contact cement
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nothing else
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Not even foam
Nokri (Marisa): Wonderflex on top and then craft foam underneath so it doesnâ€™t murder my skin
Nokri (Marisa): Oo guess Iâ€™ll die then
Time to start over
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ðŸŽµ i need to design thor ðŸŽµ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ðŸŽµ but im a lazy pooðŸŽµ
Glonk: All you have to do is make mjolnir, like the comics, once you wield it, you're automatically given the armor
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _oh mood_
Bill: Actually <@!334090409389195266> Kurto convinced me on the way to laser tag to be fat thor for CCE. You got a wig rec for that?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'll look for you o3o
Bill: I guess I also need a beard.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): his matted hair? or like end of movie hair?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): when he has his confidence back?
Bill: NAH depressed and loser Thor!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): okie dokie
Bill: 
Bill: That's not as complicated as I remembered, It's. literally a mop on his head.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye
Bill: For someone reason I thought he still had the norse braids in his hair.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you could get a dirty blonde lacefront and use hair wax
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): to get those like dirty strands
Bill: ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he has a widows peak though, slight.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so  any dirty blonde *widows peak* lacefront
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: and a blonde jesus beard would probably finish the look.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): how bout the one a lot of cosplayers use for raven from arda
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that might be TOO much of a widows peak
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats pretty severe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~also i think like 60+ dollars~~
Bill: OPTIONS lol
Bill: Do I want a wavy one? I'm thinking no, the product will give it enough waviness.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wavy is okay, you can always straighten or brush out the waves to start from scratch
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats a lacefront tho?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats a pretty good deal for a lacefront
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://www.amazon.com/Kryssma-Blonde-Front-Ombre-Synthetic/dp/B07K45V596/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=dirty+blonde+lace+front&qid=1558377183&s=gateway&sr=8-3
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this one isnt widows peak but its his color and i can attest to the quality
Bill: YE I just looked at that one!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this ones a side part which might look better overall??? but its a little bit shorter than that first one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://www.amazon.com/Kryssma-Ombre-Blonde-Synthetic-Resistant/dp/B07FC7G9ML/ref=pd_sbs_194_33?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07FC7G9ML&pd_rd_r=43f51d86-7b2e-11e9-a967-b34187462b23&pd_rd_w=MsthS&pd_rd_wg=p6U1Z&pf_rd_p=588939de-d3f8-42f1-a3d8-d556eae5797d&pf_rd_r=F78H029MCWB1WBVTPDJT&psc=1&refRID=F78H029MCWB1WBVTPDJT
Bill: Shorter isn't bad... so long as it's neck length I'm guessing it'd be fine.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea id say to measure from the top of your head to your shoulder to make sure its not like a BOB on you
Bill: Doesn't list the length tho does it?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it should somewhere in the description
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ðŸ¤”
Bill: Nope.
Bill: Tis returnable so...
Bill: I can yolo it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): trueeeeeeee
Bill: done. I'm probably better off waiting on the beard till I have something to match it to.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaaaa probably
Bill: productive.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WOO
Bill: I literally need nothing other than the wig and beard. Though I should probably get some memey swim wear to run with the bit.
Bill: Fortnite have branded bathing suits?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): all im seeing is for boys 14-16

Bill: Oh wow.

Bill: I think that was a Zenkai I was at?
Bill: Maybe?
Nokri (Marisa): Then you know how bad Sinon is <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I donâ€™t because I donâ€™t think I saw it.
Bill: I know I didnâ€™t at otakon, you were so busy I never saw you except for that Hiyori shoot.
Bill: Which was AWFUL and donâ€™t you start itâ€™s you, I had no idea how to use a flash and only had... god, the on camera flash of the 3300?
Bill: Yikes.
Nokri (Marisa): It was an Otakon before Hiyori
Nokri (Marisa): It was at an Otakon in Baltimore
Nokri (Marisa): Nah that was my fault
