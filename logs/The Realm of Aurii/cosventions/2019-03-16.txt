Elfriede Faun (Tom): Although I did mute bne so that's half gone

N🆗ri (Marisa): cheaper to import
N🆗ri (Marisa): i legit bought so much when borders went out of business. 90% off.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ooof
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Missed opportunity
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can see my english copies are becoming dated while the japanese copies are newer. i think yona is the most recent i've gotten in english? meanwhile japanese is up to date on hero academia, aoharu x kikanjuu, cells at work, made in abyss, etc.

Bill: Yes.
Bill: I’m mentally ~~dead~~ old.
Aldus Larian (Jess): LOL rich 20 something girls yea ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): only upper middle class 50 year olds can afford it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I’m a rich 20 something guy I mean.
N🆗ri (Marisa): hello my good bff best friend how are u buddy
Aldus Larian (Jess): The pay gap is real
Bill: Hush Nokri.
Bill: There’s a women with a squeaker voice than an anime protagonist.
Bill: It’s terrifying.
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo works two jobs, i only have the one job but i'm also in charge of the shop now, our toilet is still broken and whenever someone takes a shower pieces of the ceiling rain down and the kitchen leaks lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): is she kawaii
N🆗ri (Marisa): the draft upstairs was so strong last night i was convinced an animal had gotten in, stuff kept blowing around and parts of the roof kept clacking together
N🆗ri (Marisa): squeaky voice woman is trying to assert her dominance as the kawaiiest and most petite there so what you have to do is get a furry squeaker and communicate only through that
Bill: It’s worse than chocowaffo.
Bill: Also. She shots rescue dogs which I’m curious about but I’d have to TALK to her.
N🆗ri (Marisa): you mean photography and not guns right
Bill: Ye
Bill: This is mostly women actually. Different than usual.
N🆗ri (Marisa): see your harem came true
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo!
Bill: Still 50 year old.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Are they milfs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Bill: The other classes I took were mostly men, which is why I comment on it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): *Stacy's mom eerily plays in the background*
Bill: ~~I like younger we’re off that topic~~
Bill: They. Made a joke about stalking the presenter. It’s. Maybe true.
Bill: Seems like he knows half the room. 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): have they gone to meetups before? the meetups i've been to usually everyone who's gone before knows each other and the hosts make it a point to remember everyone
Bill: Yeah they known each other from other classes.
Bill: Oof mingle over pizza break is oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): “So... take any good pictures recently?
Bill: Squeaky woman and old guy 1/2 both have worked for area newspapers.
Bill: Why didn’t I bring someone to model for me rather than this photographer shooting photographer plan.
Bill: ~~I have beautiful friends and should show them off~~
Bill: Ooooh V wig Monday apparently.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Take artsy selfies
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOA
N🆗ri (Marisa): L i f t o f f
Bill: Oof. I just lost a roll of film.
Bill: The film snapped in the camera so it didn’t spool.
Bill: I’m really sad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I think they sent me someone else's order on top of getting these
N🆗ri (Marisa): Four shoes??
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because I also got two of the same pair of black dress shoes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That I didn't order
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And aren't even in my size
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But they were addressed to me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh wait, they're two *slightly* different styles
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like... I didn't order these... nor do they even fit me
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👀 👀 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whatchu gonna do with um
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm gonna contact the seller to just be like "Hey, just so you know... you sent ne these as well..." and if they say not to bother sending them back probably see if anyone wants them. Would they fit Tom?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea Tom's a 9
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll keep you posted, but he's definitely welcome to have them if they tell me not to send them back. I'll keep you posted
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Surprise new shoes lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> neato! Yea if they don't want them back Tom could use them prob
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also got my rave top. Not really anything to do with Blake but it's kind of purpley and fuck yeah galaxy print
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo neato!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ERIK IM SO JELLY OF YOUR RAVE CLOTHES
N🆗ri (Marisa): I just made my pants for terra, they’re just above the knee and slim fitting. I’m considering making them a little looser? There’s no comic version of terra in the teen titans outfit is there. Do you guys think the pants are supposed to be tight or loose like shorts.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe I make shorter because cartoon proportions have them short
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think they should be whatever you're more comfortable in
N🆗ri (Marisa): *but is that canon*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Everything else already sucks I wanna make sure the pants aren’t atrocious
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think theyre prob slim fit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): youre prob right
N🆗ri (Marisa): I made four bags that’s a number of bags. 
Are you guys making communicators?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They aren't
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But you could
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
terra the last to get hers in the main group tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I just wanted to know what color to make my belt buckle <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): "I remember the days when con safety meant VAs going like :' i love you guys…..but I’m an old man whose back is fucked so please no glomping' not 'There was a murder attempt on an artist so we can’t accept gifts'"
<:mood:543191222127296522>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeeee of
Bill: I made a friend and learned stuff.
Bill: Good class.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im glad you went
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it seemed like a good opportunity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and my mom always said "make choices that give you more choices"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): did they show you how to use tech you already have or stuff to buy?
Bill: And got a girls number. 😏
Bill: (She’s engaged)
Bill: But actually in her 20s! Unlike the rest of the class!
Bill: I figured from the ring but still nice to have made a photographer friend.
Bill: ~~we traded facebooks and she asked, based one of the selfies of Georgia and me, if she’s my girlfriend~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): do she got an insta
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im not gonna stalk her i just like seein photographer styles
Bill: Stalk her idc.
N🆗ri (Marisa): stalk time
Bill: I don’t have her insta yet, we traded facebooks and phone numbers.
Bill: Also, found out umbrella + flash works as well as a soft box and is WAY easier to carry. My impulse buy was another flash.
Bill: Inspired most of the room with a photo idea.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so you got new techniques to try out at zenkai?
Bill: Presenter is V nice, will look for his classes.
Bill: Mostly for boudoir.
Bill: Unless I get someone to be a mobile lightstand on the con floor.
Bill: Natural light still the best thing for cosplay, given color and backdrops.
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you get a press badge you can use light stands
Bill: No staffing sucks.
N🆗ri (Marisa): press badge isn't staffing
Bill: This was basically me practicing at Leanna’s with her and Kurto, but with a dozen photographers and way more fancy lights.
N🆗ri (Marisa): staffers don't get to use light stands <:lenny:395307171539189760> we get no privileges rip
Bill: Mooshoot photography.
Bill: That’s her business account.
Bill: Showed her grey towers cause I was talking about the site, she asked if Georgia paid me. Either means a pro thinks I should be or they were HORRIBLE.
Bill: Okay, doing a nyoom.
Bill: 🚙
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow she likes close ups
N🆗ri (Marisa): where's all the cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye gotta get her into cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): time 2 stalk
Bill: You can pay her and she’d shoot you. 😏
