Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ok Scott asked how much Friday through Sunday staying would cost
Bill: Check the chart. That’d be 8 people times two nights.
Bill: Think 140.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): idea to keep costs low: throw a huge party in one room and charge a cover fee
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): what is this supposed to mean. y'all are supposed to feed us.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): WHAT IS THIS PICTURE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS FORM

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Swish on point
Bill: ~~I make the charts for a reason~~
Bill: 156ish.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i cannot understand them bill i am a stupid
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): NO u not a stupid
it's split up oddly because of the different people staying different lengths so the chart doesn't work i don't think. or it's wonky and requires more math.

also i just re-read everything now that i'm awake and i can totally sleep on the balcony or under the table
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): do we have 6 or 7 currently staying? and 5 are staying through monday?
when we get the numbers we caoh good you're awake still
Bill: For any given day, take the cost for the number of people staying that night. Repeat for the rest of the nights.
Bill: In Scott’s case, 8 people Friday, 8 people Saturday.
Bill: 7, 5 staying through Monday. (Dave Jess Tom Me you)
Bill: Scott would be 8.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): o is andru not going?

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): when we gettin another big magical girl group together
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): also sometime this year i may request to borrow someone's kitchen for a photoshoot and i will pay by providing a crepe and parfait buffet for all involved
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): u can borrow my kitchen but is smol. georgia kitchen is like from a home decorating catalog tho
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): smol is ok as long as it looks like a kitchen! i shall provide all the crepe and parfaits your heart may desire
i just can't use mine because my kitchen is also the living room and main entryway, and there is no counter space
so i may request to freeload in someone's kitchen for a day but i promise i'll clean up after cookin
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): YES PLZ
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i'm not too well versed in savory crepes but if they're sweet i can do it
i'm gonna make a cookbook series for cons based on cookbooks sold at doujin events here
Bill: Do I take a half day thursday of Katsu, or the whole day.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): All Day All Day
Bill: It's not like I'm going to leave any earlier...
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): **All Day All Day**
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): would you be interesting in helping with a cooking photoshoot
Bill: sure. You know if you come to north jersey I'll be around just to hangout anyway.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): you're just there under the sign that says "welcome to north jersey" chillin
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah pm
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Uwu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lol cuz its just that easy to move
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): parfaits i'll need some practice with beforehand (i know the theory and tricks behind making them look good) but i can make crepes like this if i just get the proportions right
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): so i make a book to explain to others and sell it in artist alley
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): can make contract to share profits
Bill: wait our overnight is only 5 cons?
Bill: I could have swore we were at 6.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): HA ONLY?
Bill: *I know, I know, but I really thought we had 6*
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): only
Bill: It's just one week to do con weekends, if I don't take any thursdays.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): do you do nycc or ausa
Bill: neither, but ANYC.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Naht at the moment
Bill: "at the moment"
Bill: *are you considering expanding the circuit there buddy*
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): come with meeee
Bill: ~~I do want to go to Anime Boston at some point, buttttt~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And you'll bee
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): anime boston had a really good amv that won an award there that could only be won there because it just made fun of boston the whole time
Bill: o and I was low key wanting to look into holmat.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): to make it clear, no he isnt thinking of expanding the circuit
Bill: Cause fuck konkon, too cold, I wanna drink in florida.
Bill: *Teasing, promise*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I already think we do too many so I'd drop some for others if that's the case
Bill: This is more than enough for me too, My original goal was to have 4 overnight cons and here I am with 5. I want to keep the vacation requirements from work down.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): bring your coworkers
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what, dont wanna spend ALL your vacation days on cons? 😭
Bill: Yeah, despite what people seem to think.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): why not? its great!
Bill: oof. To do the holiday vacation I like do I'll need 5 days this year.
Bill: Xmas eve (where I'm for sure starting) is a tuesday, I... suppose I could do the Monday and just have 4 days for xmas eve through new years?
Bill: but having to work that monday will suck ~~though lets be real I'll be working from home so~~
Bill: Probably shouldn't put in for Ota, since  I haven't bought the ticket yet...
Bill: Well, <@!141729881779077121> and Mawisa will go to that no matter what right?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): yeah otakooooon

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i expect to see a several page soliloquy on the subject in your channel
Bill: Even if Georgia is in where ever the ass hell NASA is, pretty sure that's right by DC anyway so we'll likely see her, min sat sun.
Bill: So I can safely put in for that I think.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): georgia on the moon
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): mooncon
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): omg i'm reading a blog and i know the guy on this contact advertisement. he gave me soap from malaysia once.

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): lets all take long chin selfies some day
Bill: Half days for thursday of Katsu/Ota, I took the thursday of CCE straight off.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): did otakon ever bring its matsuri to dc or was that stopped entirely
Bill: not idea.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): due to that we'd always have to go down wednesday or sometimes tuesday for ota
Bill: yeah no, I don't have that kind of time.
Bill: Unless I wanted to turn the whole week into a vacation, actually go places in DC.
Bill: ~~which is not something I want to do in the heat of summer~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i think they stopped doing it when they moved to DC. we only did it in baltimore because zenkai staff would get free badges for helping out
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): bring back really horribly awkward and cringy convention advertisements those were great
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP5lz2CYNR4
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): just give us 5 minutes straight of someone in homestuck cosplay flossing followed by "go to otakon" in comic sans
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that'll do it
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): oooo the magfest badges have preferred pronouns on them that's really cool
