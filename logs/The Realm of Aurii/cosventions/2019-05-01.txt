Bill: Imma tell Scott our peeps who dropped are back so he out, but then want to inform Tristan/Anna they are peeps not fills.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😬
Bill: What.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Scott
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeeoof
N🆗ri (Marisa): did something happen with him at the con?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *you were there, weren't you?*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think? <:woah:543194447345876998> I just recall him trying to get close to starryshyroo a lot and the one photoshoot
N🆗ri (Marisa): was there another reason he's considered oof now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it was because he's also fake
N🆗ri (Marisa): RIGHT i forgot about all the promoted posts
N🆗ri (Marisa): which are basically all of his posts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and forgetting to credit you or Jess
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and being rude when you *finally* got his photos back to him
N🆗ri (Marisa): and when he does credit, he just tags us without any context <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah he didn't tag you as photographer
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's basically the devil
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He broke rule 2
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He was mean to Marisa
Bill: Ye he broke the rule.
Bill: I didn’t really like him from the start tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is not mean, he didn't start a fistfight
Bill: *He is mean*
Bill: *if the saintly Mawisa complained about him he is mean*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *insert gif of that one dude from whose line is it saying "hey you wanna start a fight?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): is just not following the socially accepted online cosplayer rules of interaction and coming off as a prick due to it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: He made you upset.
Bill: Qed.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah, I mean talking to him was fine
Bill: We’re done.
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://media.giphy.com/media/oidPWOqPgEnw4/giphy.gif
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEAH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FoolhardyGreedyCat-size_restricted.gif
Bill: I love Ryan Styles.
Bill: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw62_ThDAcD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link This an awesome shot.
Bill: Tis what I was talking about using your neo umbrella with the flash Leanna.
N🆗ri (Marisa): am interested in potential avengers at ota if it happens but also very scared to vocalize this opinion
Bill: you are going to *die* in the heat though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh that would be fine, i wore edea at otakon and that was worse.
three layers in literal 100 degree weather, felt like 111 degrees according to the news.
cotton under fleece under vinyl with foam armor over some parts. good times. i had to hang the costume in the bathroom afterwards it was drenched with sweat.
Bill: I remember, you were insane then too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just. don't want to keep butting into other's plans because i feel i'm a nuisance who would hold the group back. one side of me says that since you mentioned the potential ota plans in the other group it would be alright to ask to join? but the other side is. wary and scared of offending you guys or making an awkward situation.
N🆗ri (Marisa): if it even happens at all
Bill: MARISA. You are NEVER butting in.
Bill: If you wanting to is, I *just* bullied my way in by saying I want to do it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): opposite i am ALWAYS here to be a neener <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ur cool tho
Bill: AS ARE YOU.
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw
Bill: You need to stop telling me I'm wrong. =/
Bill: You may disagree with me, but my opinions are mine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's my opinion that cosplay groups are an exclusive cool kid thing that i don't really belong in but would be nice to join, but if people don't want me in a group that is also fine and very understandable and i don't want to pressure anyone into letting me join a group. i already forced my way into this avengers group, teen titans, mystic mess, and spirited away and i feel like i'm being way too greedy.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Anyone would be honored to have you in thier group.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Marisa, you didn't force your way into any of those groups
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We all love you and want to cosplay with you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We love having you be part of groups
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Those aren't opinions, they are facts
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's on the internet so it must be true
Bill: ,... See, on the contrary, I think you need to be in even more cosplay groups. As far as I'm concerned cosplay is boring solo and being in a group while cosplaying is the best part of it. It gives you a stronger sense of belonging and the group bonds over the planning and recognition.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): except for one or two times tho i've cosplayed solo for 10 years. it's a hard habit to break
Bill: I know you want to cosplay everything and cosplay everything only once but BNE would not have formed if everyone didn't redo costumes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't like wearing the costumes only once, that just happens because they suck too much and i want to try to keep improving
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA marisa im excited to do it at ota, of course we want you!
Bill: Maybe you need a dose of Rwby AU hell. Make every variant of Ruby. Remake them. Constantly improve on one thing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): faux fur might be on sale in the summer
Bill: Your overall skills improve by doing new things, but if you want to fix the problems you feel in one outfit, do *more* of that thing to grind that stat.
N🆗ri (Marisa): a..................u? au?? ?? not .canon????
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i realized yesterday that ive somehow done more marvel cosplays than rwby and thats concerning because i basically have only done rwby for like 3 years
Bill: Your costumes do *not* suck.
N🆗ri (Marisa): because the vacuum is broken but we can fix that
N🆗ri (Marisa): how many rwby vs marvel do you have?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wait. There's an avengers ota group too?
Aldus Larian (Jess): God I'm so out the looo
N🆗ri (Marisa): join join join
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think it was a to be seen tho
Bill: Same group, Leanna just messaged if people are finished pre katsu maybe Ota.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): ohhh ok  I was confused
Bill: I really think you'd benefit from slowing down Marisa. Not saying do less cosplay (perish the thought), but rather than 9 costumes make 3.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sounds fake but ok
Yeh I usually only make 2-3 per con
Bill: Then just two, or even one.
Bill: I think you spread yourself too thin trying to cosplay so many characters and you upset yourself because of it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): stretched, like butter over too much bread
Bill: You have lots of talent, but impossible deadlines are impossible for a reason.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m just lazy and wait until the last minute for most things
N🆗ri (Marisa): No talents just self suffering
Bill: You have talent.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Butter is good
Bill: ~~you are the butter in that anology so yes it is good~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m best at room temperature
Bill: So long as you're in the room. <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Im usually in the fridge until a recipe calls for butter and then I get nuked in the microwave for 20 seconds
Bill: These are just observations I've made Mawisa. You're talented, but you rush things and (while being able to finish anything so rushed is an accomplishment in itself) you then beat yourself up over it not being the best you can do.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!!! That’s me! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And yet it still look good
Bill: So slow down just a bit, space out your work more, so you can spend more time improving the cosplay before the debut ~~and never wear it again~~.
Bill: It does!
Aldus Larian (Jess): but then 
get this
Aldus Larian (Jess): you wear it again
Bill: GROUNDBREAKING
Bill: HOT TAKES
Bill: MORE AT 11
Aldus Larian (Jess): and again, and with your friends
and meme with them
Bill: MORE MEMES
Bill: THATS THE ONLY REASON TO COSPLAY
Bill: I'm not saying I think ANY of your cosplay is bad either, to be **100%** clear. I'm saying you beat yourself up over the quality of it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): even tho its amazing every single time xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): share some talent with the rest of us, marisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye cuz the quality is terrible because I only work well with a deadline
Im not running away from the convo I’m just watching someone who crashed into a dumpster outside fighting with a guy with a leaf blower
N🆗ri (Marisa): Have you seen your costumes omg
I am goodwill and you are Gucci
Bill: You feel that way, cause *every* artist is their own worst critic.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): excuse me, you are chanel
Bill: Do you have that cosplanner app Marisa.
Bill: You should use that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~thats a good brand right?~~
Bill: Give yourself a serious deadline of one task every 7 days. Or split would make sense.
Bill: And then you can show us the progress and we'll be your deadline enforcers.
Bill: And if you don't like how it came out, you can revisit it in the next time frame.
Bill: That's called agile development in geek land.
Bill: Which completely kicked the crap out of waterfall, which is 'do everything and hope it all works at the end' method.
Bill: And again, if you asked me I think your cosplays are amazing as is. But I see *you* being upset with the quality so I'm making these suggestions to help you deal with the ArTiStIc AnGsT.
N🆗ri (Marisa): O I used to have that app but lazy
One task every seven days <:woah:543194447345876998> but I’ll never get anything done
One costume every seven days
Bill: Call it the opposite. Most people use cosplanner to keep them working, you use it to slow down your working.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Gotta go fast
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sonic taught me that
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): <@184437198865563648> , I'm interested in going to Katsucon, I'll have to talk to Dan about it and see what he wants to do.
Bill: mmmmkay. Go hit Dave and have him confirm for me.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is this really a face you can trust?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Evil
N🆗ri (Marisa): Evil demon
N🆗ri (Marisa): Away
Bill: ~~I suppose you going is confirmation enough, you guys going to Seige hardcore~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Glonk: Hewowo
Bill: Katsu yes?
Glonk: Yeah
Bill: kk.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH WOOO
Bill: I feel bad for Anna and Pasq but they can stay with Mag and that's an easy gig.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> Katsu?
Andrew: yesa
Bill: kk.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So uhhh who’s gonna answer Scott
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think Bill's trying to confirm that the rooms are filled first
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at least that's what it seems like he's doing lol
Bill: Oh I refuse to add Scott again.
Bill: I don’t like him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): even though I know he wouldn't feel bad at all lying through his teeth to Scott about that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Bill: I needed to know who of Anna/Tristan I need to dm after I say “booked sorry” that they’re included in my count. It’s just Tristan atm.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Make up the last person lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sorry, the last spot was filled by Mark Nutt
Bill: > sends to Scott
> tabs to Tristan
> half way typed message
> Tristan starts typing
Bill: Exactly why I wanted the short list first.
Bill: I am not required to give Scott a roster? Technically we are filled, though Ash isn’t sure.
Bill: And if she isn’t I have no obligation to give him the space.
Bill: And if he’s at all a dick about it I don’t have to be diplomatic.
Bill: Tristan’s in FYI.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t think he will freak out, we did him a favor last year
Andrew: who is this scott character
Bill: A tool.
Andrew: oohhhhh
Andrew: whats the juicy details
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ok he’s not as bad as Bill conveys cause bill NEVER liked him
Bill: He broke rule number 2. No being mean to Marisa.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s just kinda lame
Bill: ~~Tristan is kinda lame, Scott a fake person~~
Andrew: how can anyone do that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tristan isn’t lame 😠
Andrew: legiot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Y u so judge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that was kind of rude ngl
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that was uncalled for
Bill: Okay. I like Tristan. Otherwise I wouldn’t have already counted him in again.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why’d you call him lame then
Bill: My point is I don’t think “kinda lame” is strong enough a term for Scott. “Kinda lame” at best describes someone I do like.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Weird flex but ok
Bill: Tristan and I have never really clicked..
Bill: Not in a bad way, we just haven't.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You don’t have to click
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You can still appreciate him as a person
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I find him very genuine and go with the flow
Bill: Whiiiivh is why I still invited him.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmm I’m still bothered by your comment but ok
Bill: Not clicking isn't not liking I just... haven't had that one conversation or experience that defines the friendship. I specifically looked for him at Otakon last year. Tis how I knew he needed a Katsu room in the first place.
Bill: There's no real bond, there just... is.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do you retract that he’s lame then
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just say sorry
Bill: Ah, I meant to say sorry with the "Okay" line. Yes, sorry.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do you not mean it
Bill: I do mean it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mean the apology or mean the insult?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 👏 I do not think you’re using the word lame correctly 👏
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You probably meant boring
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or something
Bill: I had no intention to shit on Tristan as a person. I do feel our relationship is kinda lame, person to person. But that's equal parts him and myself. If you want a better choice of words, our relationship is flat. No substance.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That is better words yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): lame is like "un-cool"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Saying he’s lame blames him as a person
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: Sure. The choice of word came from the description of Scott to begin with.
Bill: Remember that I didn't jump at adding him to Zenkai's rooms. The fact that I wanted him along for Katsu should already be indicator I like him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like maybe we should drop this conversation now
Aldus Larian (Jess): you liking him isnt the issue though. no ones saying you dont like him. perhaps just consider your words better next time. No one likes to hear thier friends insulted.
Aldus Larian (Jess): opp sorry
Bill: true. And I didn't mean to make for an insult to him, so the call out is good.
Bill: I'm not particularly upset Erik. Twas not said well and I acknowledge, admit, and apologize for that. I'm just explaining the line of thought that caused said mistake.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Subject change
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But Scott posting vlog screenshots? Weird
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean it looks kinda like a selfie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But also no
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): side note: can i room with ya'll for ota 👀
Bill: it was expected.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i figured, but also just wanted to ask in case xD
Andrew: Changing to Anext, how many do we have
Bill: 12? Cept Tom and Jess leave Saturday.
Bill: And circle around to the original thing, Scott's dealt with.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Back to Ota, is there still any room? I'm princess gonna do Saturday into Sunday
Bill: too many fucking circle man. I think so.
Bill: We have two suites so it's a little weird.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just let me know. If not it's ok
Bill: yes, I just gotta remember the layout and head count.
Bill: I think it's like a king with a living room that has pullout sofa and probably floor space for one... Then Georgia and I, Tom and Jess, Andrew and Marisa... Leanna, you? yeah.
Bill: easily fine.
Bill: Dave is with Ash and Dan somewhere else.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can curl up on floor
Bill: won't even need to.
Bill: that was 8 between the two rooms.
Bill: https://embassysuites3.hilton.com/en/hotels/district-of-columbia/embassy-suites-by-hilton-washington-dc-convention-center-WASCCES/accommodations/suites.html no way to know which, but one of the king suite set ups.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): can i perhaps carpool with someone? because i really do not want to drive all that way alone
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~esp after my panic attack at sakura sunday~~
Bill: Probably.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): to otakon?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if im in the area i can offer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~nasa u bitch answer faster~~
Bill: lets hope you can't do the car pool. There;s going to be three cars coming from Sussex so...
Bill: Easily room.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeee i dont mind driving to any of yall houses or whatever too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its just the drive as it gets closer to the city that freaks me out
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and parking garages
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >.>
Bill: It'll be fine... It's probably going to me picking up Andrew and Marisa, Tom Jess and maybe Dave, then Ash and Dan.
Bill: Dave is wildcard.
Bill: parking expensive down there, less cars the better.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh rude, Otakon now does single day badges. I had to buy a two-day last year to just go Saturday
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and the price got jacked up from last year
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof
Andrew: ota expensive
Andrew: very very expensive
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): badge + hotel + valet parking
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): anyway, badge bought
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): why badge prices go up AGAIN wtf
Andrew: are they charging for the concert as well again
Andrew: that was some serious goouging
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ethan liked my picture, I hope he can see my neck. I know it's hard to find
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): what? you have a neck? i thought only giraffes had those?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): LMAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jess is IRL San
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have dubbed it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): IRL SAN IRL SAN IRL SAN
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): IRL-san?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can do impressions too! *Screams*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): *attacks boys with a knife*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Dream girl status ofc
But also
Woah slow down there yandere
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The neck is right THERE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ethan:
Elfriede Faun (Tom): For moment from the preview I thought someone made an :Ethan:
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ghgjkgkjgg oh god no
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did Ethan make a comment about your neck because it sounds like he wants to lose his
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He sure did
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't have a neck guys idk what your are talking about
N🆗ri (Marisa): have you seen ethan's neck tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): look at his profile picture he doesn't have one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): marisa i thought that said dick
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i was put into cardiac arrest
N🆗ri (Marisa): nOO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): FUCKING YIKES
N🆗ri (Marisa): that word is illegal it violates the geneva convention
N🆗ri (Marisa): but i mean
he might not have that either idk
N🆗ri (Marisa): the only time i ever met him i think i broke his arm
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): good
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): what series have i cosplayed the most of <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
i think its idols
N🆗ri (Marisa): 5 idols
4 ghibli
4 rwby
i think

i should cosplay every frog from sgt frog. all of them.
N🆗ri (Marisa): idols being OG love live idols specifically and not idols in general
N🆗ri (Marisa): next up frog idols
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): >>> tries to do something on Instagram
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): >>> only one person comments correctly
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh that was a cute idea tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think only one in every 100 people read the description
N🆗ri (Marisa): o zeikani offers mini-shoots
Bill: Well followers have the collective intelligence of a bag of rocks so.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what bullying has been going on lately?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ethan said I have no neck so
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think a_smile_and_a_song got bullied off IG
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And they were like famoose
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeesh
Bill: I called Scott various forms of tool ~~and hit Tristan on misfire~~. 

*I am the problem in the cosplay community owo*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Basically she had a “dad” cosplay themed party
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And she did Mina was a friend as sleepy teacher man
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And so she was the “kid” to his “dad” for the party theme and she had like a bib and everything
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): People accused her of pedophilia
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or supporting it at least
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And she came out and said no she was actually molested as a child
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So she quit
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooooof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): jeez
Bill: I’m... a tad confused by this party but to each their own.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was when Dream daddy came out
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooh
oh wow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which I think was two years ago but the cosplay pics just surfaced
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ARENT YALL GLAD MY PARTIES DONT HAVE THEMES OOF
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But yeah she had like a shit ton of followers
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So people are actually acknowledging the role of bullying now
Bill: Instagram is a mess.
Bill: And Zeikani does Mawisa. I wanted to do one CPAC but things were confusing so I never booked it.
Bill: See her work.
N🆗ri (Marisa): does she have a portfolio somewhere? i just saw the ad while browsing the anext tag
Bill: I don’t think so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is still expensive but is also tempting because everyone else is more expensive
Bill: I invited her to the photo server, she just hasn’t joined yet.
Andrew: 
Andrew: Weiss and cosplay
Bill: Not the Weiss I thought of.
Bill: Also sent an invite to Ash’s Dan. I know he hate discord but.
Bill: Should dm Lissy too, doubt she saw the message in BNE...
Andrew: I made the hole too big for the gem time to improvise
N🆗ri (Marisa): How much extra big is it? :0
Andrew: A couple millimeters
Andrew: It happened during dremnmeling
Andrew: I'm going to get another piece and glue it underbeath
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee fill that in with some stuff you use to fill in between wood pieces
Andrew: Ive got that foam putty
Bill: Yo you never talk about cosplay stuff and you should Andrew; you totally sound like you know what you’re doing.
