No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): This nearly made me hyperventilate on the train it‚Äôs so funny
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i know i should be patient but i'm kind of really getting agitated over my zenkaikon application. this is the 4th month since i've sent in an application. I hate to keep bothering her but I messaged the head of security again asking if there are any updates and if I don't get put on staff (which I should, because I have a ton of department heads vouching for me, but apparently no one's getting my application) i'll probably just submit some panels so i can at least get a free badge.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): though BoJo said that if I'm not staffing, she's going to resign from staff because I was the only reason she volunteered. and Bojo is in charge of security for the entire dealer's hall and created the current line system so if she quits they're in big trouble <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: what a good mom.
Elfriede of commitment?: Ugh
Elfriede of commitment?: That's super wierd
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üò¶ what heck zenkaikon
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): just checked my last e-mail, they said i would get an update "On October 28th, or shortly thereafter."
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): *it's november now*
Bill: I haven't packed.
Bill: #workfromhome
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my Hiyori contacts were in Avenel  yesterday i know  imma get them Saturday ofc
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üôè  maybe ill get really lucky and theyll come today
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oh my goodness. i'm talking with the con chair and this is INSANE
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): dude in charge of staff this year needs to be fired
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): D:!
Elfriede of commitment?: Oh nooo
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): OK. SO. ready for some beans
Elfriede of commitment?: YE
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): con chair herself went and looked for my file because safety still didn't get it.
my application was in **con ops**.  I didn't even put con ops on my application anywhere. that's one of the last places i want to be. that's sitting in a room all day doing paperwork, it's con jail, it's where bad attendees are sent to have their badges confiscated and where disputes are resolves. I'm assuming the guy in charge of staff tried to send me to cosplay, just typed in C O and hit enter and i went to con ops instead. but that still doesn't explain why i wasn't transferred to the safety application afterwards. so con chair herself personally moved my file into the safety list.

i'm not the only one that's had issues. many many people have gone straight to the con chair herself to complain about staff application issues so I can only imagine how many the help desk are getting from first time applicants. I told her if she needs help to let me handle staff applications too because this is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. How many new staff are having issues because of this? this is gonna turn them away from the con and make them unwilling to recommend new volunteers.
Bill: WOW.
Bill: That's ridiculous.
Bill: Should have seen if Con Chair couldn't move you back to cosplay.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): so i should be good to go now. BoJo even said I can be on her team, or if I don't want that I can go with Irene's team but I'll probably stick with BoJo because ~~nepotism~~ I'm used to being in the dealer's hall anyway because that was my last job
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): cosplay is unfortunately full now, i can try to transfer next year if they have any openings. now I can also enter the costume contest yehaw
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i'll also get to wear a radio :3c
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is Irene the older lady with the ball gowns?
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): o I don't think so? :0 I think you're talking about Dizzy Lizzy, the head of cosplay. Irene is in charge of the safety team that mostly patrols around the con
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): and does info desk i think
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA cosplay lady! i think she does other cons too
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): yeah!! shes a judge for a bunch of stuff and staffs animenext and runs otakon's masquerade now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA she do work son
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): she seems like the kinda lady not to mess with lol
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): we need better gopher training too. seriously. Every Single Year when I try to enter the dealer's hall when it's closed (because I was dealer's staff and had to get in *to help set it up and sign in exhibitors*) the gophers wouldn't let me in and had to ask kris if it was ok for me to enter. and kris had to be like. "Yes. She is our staff. She has a staff badge. Let Her In."
Then I wasn't allowed in an 18+ panel **that I assigned to work** because i looked young. I was like "I have a staff badge you have to be over 18 to staff" and they were like "sorry you need a wristband." *I didn't have time for a wristband because I was staffing all day, and staff badge trumps wristband.* They even said that when I went for a wristband, like "why are you getting one? your badge should work fine." *tell that to the gopher.*
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH dizzy really saved my hide when I was alone on prop check because people would try to intimidate me, even when i tried to work with them when possible, and Dizzy would turn around and 100% shut them down.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA i get that vibe. like she seems like she can get shit done and take no shit. also wtf gophers??
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like you have a staff badge you are alike all access
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): YEAH
like, some I get. I try to bypass the line for the masquerade sometimes because I stand in the back and take pictures, but they don't let me in if I'm off duty because that's abuse of privilege, even if I'm not going to sit down. I get that. I'll wait until everyone in line goes in and everyone is seated and walk-ins are OK before going in before I absolutely hate abusing my power (that's why I just stand in the back and don't take a chair, there's usually plenty of seats left over). BUT IF I GOTTA WORK U GOTTA LET ME IN
Bill: Mawisa gunna sneak us into all the cool staff stuff.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ~~the 21+ secret staff panel i can do~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i can give u heads up on events ;3c
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): but if they tell me "secret secret" then i can't
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Marisa is a good girl ‚Ñ¢
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): is this con venting time
am i allowed to bash someone who is my dear friend
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): as long as its not meeeee
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): NO never u
Bill: Dra-ma! Dra-ma!
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): unless you've been banned from several cons and kicked off of staff
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~bold of me to amuse i am a dear friend~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ~~the dearest of closest friends~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh noooo i never staffed
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): rose, the girl that i go to cosplay events here with because i'm a wimp. she tried to get me to cut in line multiple times at the halloween cosplay event and asked if I would let her cut in line with me. I was like NO???!?? and she was like "it's fine, other people are doing it"
just because japanese people are doing it doesn't mean it's fine omg. and she takes really obvious pictures without asking which is a HUGE no over here, like a ban-able offense. she tries to be sneaky.

she takes pictures of pokemon cosplayers all the time because she knows some of the voice actors. she's friends with some and others know her by name, but that's the reason she was kicked out of cons. i'mma write more about why in a minute but i'm really hungry so i'm gonna boil an egg brb
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ok wait before i lose my train of thought
I do what I want(tm): Boild egg Never hatch
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): she brags about knowing the voice actors to everyone, which I get. it's cool. it's awesome. but it's a little weird too. like "hey can i take your picture? i'm bffs with the english voice actor."

she was banned at animenext for getting the phone number of a guest so they could chat and she complained that the guest was OK with it, but that's not the issue. it's professionalism. Guest retainers must be the utmost professional at all times. She tries to cosplay while being a guest retainer and skips her duties to meet friends and get autographs. that's why she was kicked off of staff at zenkaikon.

and then she tells people that all the staff are horrible and people shouldn't staff, but... if you're banned from staffing at 5 different conventions (not due to word of mouth but because her behavior at each was inexcusable and they asked her not to come back afterwards), it might not be the staff who're the issue.

she's a nice person and a good friend and very kind but. girl. pls
I do what I want(tm): Oof
Bill: damn.
Bill: how do you even.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): JEEZ
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): breakin da law
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i think also animenext kicked her out because she flaunted it. like, how would they even know she got the guest's phone number unless 1.) the guest complained it about or 2.) she bragged about it to everyone
I do what I want(tm): Yeahh
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): AND ALSO
i'll stop now because i'm extremely manic thanks for listening pat yourself on the back
Bill: NO
Bill: You can't say AND ALSO and stop.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): did i ever mention about how she doesn't have a driver's license and how that messed up a con once
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea she probly talked it up WHAT
Bill: OH I think I remember that story.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): if you're a guest retainer you need a car so you can pick the guest up from the airport and bring 'em to the con
she signed up to be a retainer and got to the con and they were like "cool you're here, now go to the airport"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): and she was like "I don't have a car I took greyhound here"
and it caused a huge panic and some big delays
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): they were like "why did you sign up for this duty if you don't fulfill the requirements"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): FOR REAL
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~i wouldn't even sign up for that and i have a license and car~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): I KNOW RIGHT i'd be way too nervous. i roomed with someone who had that duty once she was on call 24/7 and worked so much.
she signed up because she wanted to become friends with famous japanese people
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): but that's..... one of the hardest jobs at a con, i'd say. they purposefully make it excruciating to screen out people who just want to meet famous folk
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yup not for me lol
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): once when we worked together we had to make a blockade at an exit and we needed her and no one could find her. she had snuck off to an autograph line and was sitting there for an hour.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): a serious security issue was happening and we couldn't find her i think that was one of the final straws. she had so many chances.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): but hey if u ever need an autograph she's ur go-to
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i think that's the tricky thing about cons. people sign up to staff to get free hotel/badge/food and then slack off. it's super rewarding to do the job and making everything run smoothly is absolutely crucial and omg did i ever talk about the mess that was staff suite several years ago. "two meatballs."
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): the year all staff had super dry hands ew
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): at least they were sanitized
I do what I want(tm): Meetballs excuse
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): the dinner for that day was meatball subs but the lady in charge of staff suite said we could only have TWO meatballs on our sub and that was it. no more. they were super tiny. also they had guards out front making sure you thoroughly showered your arms in hand sanitizer before entering.

so many people complained the con chair herself lifted the meatball limit, then handed over the convention credit card and just let everyone order pizzas
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): when we worked at subway is was 3 meatballs to a six inch and MAN people got mad about that
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): how dare u deprive them
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): one guy made some snide remark about skimpking on him and I was like "3 meatball is the  limit sir, would you like to add double meat for 1.50 :D!"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): did he?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no LOL
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he just grumbled
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): meat baller
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~people treat food service workers like sheet~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): If people were nice and friendly and talked to me id give them free stuff sometimes <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "madame" tips fedora "might i please burden you for another meat ball?"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): do i get it for free now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you? yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): other ppl? na
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): but then see that would trigger me into a gift exchange and i'd have to return to buy another sandwich and give you something
good business strat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I used to give my one friend a $12 meal for like $5
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): M E G A D I S C O U N T
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): make them do a fancy handshake for it
I do what I want(tm): Ooo we used.to give Justin free bacon all the timees
I do what I want(tm): The good shit
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): free bacon, free drinks, free cookies
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG the cookies
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): best thing there
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): are the cookies worth buying?
I do what I want(tm): Yeah
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they good
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): :0
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ~~lets make subway our food stop on the way home from a con~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but only for cookies
I do what I want(tm): Yeee
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): actually now i kinda want subway what is dis
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i want buffalo chicken with bacon
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but thats so Spence i used to get it for freeeee
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): do you still have a uniform or ID badge
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): even if it's out of date
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that was what was nice about working there you got a free meal everyday even for like 3 hour shifts
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NAH
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we got any 6" 2 cookie and a refillable drink erryday
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): I READ THAT AS 6 FOOT 2 AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): 6'2" cookie
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): big oven
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LMAO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we did make a giant cookie once
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was like a frankenstien cookie
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): one kid got fired and stole 2 bags of frozen cookies on his way out XD
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): chaotic cookie nabber
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ~~fire him~~ double fired
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I used to be a shift manager - my shift was 6:30 am - 2pm and we were super busy one day, the 12:30 kid came in, worked for like 10 mins and then hes like "hey can i take a smoke break" and i was like "Seeing as ive been on my feet since 6:30, and haven't even had time to go to the bathroom, no you can't"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that made me feel so powerfull
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): darn tootin' he can't omg
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): plus he'd smell like smoke ew
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): manager jess
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA all the smokers got breaks, and anyone under 18 but if not no break for you
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): a japanese company recently made headlines for giving non-smoking employees an extra 6 days of paid vacation  because they didn't take smoke breaks
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): should be universal
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): also some woman complained about "seeing employees eating in the customer area" so even if you did get a break you had to eat in the kitchen area
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA I SAW THAT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I WANT THAT
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ~~complain about the lady~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my smoking coworkers go out at least 4 times a day for like 5-10 mins
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we dont get 15 min breaks here only 30 mins for lunch
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): that's so unfair oh no
get a bubble pipe and start taking smoking breaks to blow bubbles
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): we don't get any breaks üòé 
unless we purposefully schedule a break between lessons, but then we don't get paid for that hour üòé
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): D:
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they also do this weird thing where some people are salary and some or hourly so if you are salary your lunch can pretty much be an hour cuz there is no record of it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but im glad im hourly cuz my boss likes to act like he "owns" the salaried employees and bugs them at home and on weekends
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and tells them they have to stay late
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oo ew
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not me man 8:30-2:30 3:00-5:00 das it
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): a good healthy work
