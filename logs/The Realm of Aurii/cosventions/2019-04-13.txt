Bill: Sowwy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): DAMN

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i didnt realize kogara was so close, i wouldve offered my house oof

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): what time do we want to be at sakura sunday tomorrow? looks like no rain after noon
Bill: It’s only an hour from Kogara, though I guess you mean the round trip.
Bill: Not sure yet. We’ll probably talk about it tonight.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah if i go to yalls house then i gotta drive the extra time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause that route shoots by rutgers
Bill: I guess there’s a route that goes past Rutgers true...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ideally id like to get there at like 11/12 ish and leave like 5/6ish so idk what the general consensus is
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but i got stuff to do lol
Bill: Mmkay. We’re spread out atm, so we’ll ping you when we gather and figure out when we’re leaving.
