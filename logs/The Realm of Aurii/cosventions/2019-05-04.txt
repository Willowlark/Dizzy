Bill: Absolutely. For me too.
Bill: I had so much fun with that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea! I was fun I wouldn't know what to do alone
Bill: All I can think of is look sexy. That said, I think doing some shoots looking sexy could be useful. Alone there’ll be more focus on posing and composition which we spitballed for this.
Bill: Had the thought editing these.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bichbi already look sexy
Andrew: yo
Andrew: you guys need to see this
Aldus Larian (Jess): The suspense is killing me
Bill: The suspense is killing me my guy.

Bill: GOD what a weeb. Thatas fantastic my guy
N🆗ri (Marisa): disco shield
Andrew: rave time
Andrew: It is rather heavy for one arm tho
Andrew: so limited time poses and whatnot
Bill: You don’t have to constantly pose after all.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah m8 when you're in cosplay you gotta be always picture perfect
Andrew: ~~if im in costume im 100% gogogo all the time~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): especially when people are recording or taking sneak shots
N🆗ri (Marisa): which is always go gog o gogo
N🆗ri (Marisa): The inside of a costume when you charge in with no pattern or pre-planning, just a whole lot of moxie
Andrew: a whole lot of moxie
N🆗ri (Marisa): Flashbacks to katsucon
Cool cosplayer: “wow how’d you get the ribbon to stick out like that on the bottom? I’ve been trying to get a similar effect on another outfit”
goblin me: “I honestly have no idea it just happened like that and I don’t know any differently”
Andrew: now shield is complete
Andrew: but my room is an abosulte mess
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I don't have enough internet to watch the video but it looks dope <@141729881779077121> nice job
Andrew: My all might suit is in
Andrew: 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I got targeted advertising for this cute table with stools that swivel out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I was like damn that’d be nice for group craft sessions
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s probably like 200 bucks or something
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What the fuck my guy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s like 1000 dollars
Bill: NICE Andrew.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Someone I know is at a marvel meet up and???
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yoooo??
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YOOO?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YOOOO
Bill: That’s some good shit.
Bill: That Rocket is probably dying though.
Bill: It looks humid just from the image.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn
N🆗ri (Marisa): probably all the people dust in the air
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm reading an anthropology publication on cosplay and it says that male cosplayers may prefer to say "gear" instead of "costume"
has anyone ever heard that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): excuse me what
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): costume is too unmanly they gotta **put on their gear**
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...is that why kirishima has gears on his arms
Bill: Never heard that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): "Videogames whose target audience is primarily males refer to dressing the avatar in “gear” instead of “dress,” “costume,” or “clothing” (Brownie 2015: 145). This term is used within the Cosplay fandom selectively. Primarily male roleplaying videogame avatars/characters referred to their costumes as “gear,” while very few females referenced portions of their costumes, but usually indicating weapons as “gear.”
N🆗ri (Marisa): and then like 100 pages later
N🆗ri (Marisa): "Accordingly, Brownie and Graydon suggest that male Cosplayers may assert their maleness through character choice and the use of fandom jargon, such as using “gear” instead of “costume,” which the latter is more common in the fandom (2016: 111). My research, however, suggests that male Cosplayers adopt the language of the fandom and choose to roleplay a wide range of characters. Some males attempt to establish their position in the fandom by creating exceptional costumes, precise makeup, and perfect performances in order to avoid criticism"
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is the nature documentary we've been waiting for
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao what?
N🆗ri (Marisa): o the author has published in mechademia too
this whole book comes across as very... girl power biased. her points make sense but they're also silly and rather one-sided. she talks about how fandoms are entirely female-run spaces and women are scared of letting men into the fandom because it might become a more dangerous/toxic environment.

i looked up the author, her field of study is art history and design. reading it is very obvious she doesn't have a lot of sociocultural research background. her publications are groundbreaking as some of the first in this field but it's a shame she's trying to make an anthropology article without... idk like a more sociocultural/anthropological approach to it.

criticizing her like this feels mean but the world needs good weeb research and this book just oversimplifies problems to the point it's dehumanizing
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just wanted information on sewing arrowhead tacks how did i get here
Bill: Plus you know. Men bashing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh that's fine <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: It doesnt sound like shes ever talked to a male cosplayer
N🆗ri (Marisa): andru are you getting your **gear** ready for the next **gear** photoshoot at a **gear** convention
Andrew: Im going in spandex
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh dang why did my internet explorer open and why is it all in japanese
Andrew: No "gear" to be seen
N🆗ri (Marisa): cool so you got a new spandex gear to wear
N🆗ri (Marisa): the last pages of the book are literally just hall shots of cosplayers from nycc with an MLA style citation and caption
Andrew: Shouldnt she use APA?
Andrew: I thought that was the standard for sociology
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH SHE SHOULD
N🆗ri (Marisa): or chicago sometimes people use that
Andrew: My sociology prof was like yea only use APA
Andrew: Chicago is a favoirte for history and geography
Bill: Lol citing.
Bill: Computer science is 80% copy paste from stack overflow.
Andrew: >, such as using “gear” instead of “costume,” which the latter is more common in the fandom (2016: 111)

>"My research, however..."
Andrew: Followed by a "suggestion" that they do with no evidence
N🆗ri (Marisa): she talks a **lot** about gatekeeping even where it doesn't make sense
she mentions cosplayers are innovative in that they use "overlooked technology" like mini fans, LED lights, armature, etc. etc. that ain't overlooked technology that's just interdisciplinary construction to make up for what sewing alone can't accomplish
also  "Moreover, there is no gatekeeping for these technologies within the fandom." <:hmm:543194383885926403> is she saying that, like, there are no secrets in the cosplay community? that all knowledge is free? because there are definitely secrets, i've met a ton of cosplayers who are like "i used my secret technique to make this but i won't tell you how it's done."
Andrew: They "may" do this, or "possibly" do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH i gotta look up that citation
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~catch me writing my own book that refutes every point written in this one~~
Andrew: "My research" means nothing if you cant provide data or a record of some kind
Andrew: At least maybe a poll she did asking people at a con what they say? I mean something anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok so this Brownie person isn't even the originator of the "gear" claim, they're citing that info from Fronie et al
secondly they're using it in the context of specifically World of Warcraft. WoW players probably call it that because that's what they call it in the game? i'm assuming. like, "i'm getting upgraded gear for the next raid." and because that's how it's called in the game, they talk about irl counterparts as gear when referencing cosplay because they aren't associated with the bigger cosplay community?
N🆗ri (Marisa): but this article is incredibly biased too it's literally called "The masculinization of dressing-up"
N🆗ri (Marisa): she also has a degree in art design
i think art design majors should take a few sociology classes if they're going to be writing articles like this
N🆗ri (Marisa): or just. not be so biased pls
Andrew: Is that a physical book  youre reading? Im curious enough to check it out
N🆗ri (Marisa): eBook, i started reading and then just skimmed the rest
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh wait there is a physical copy on amazon going for $20
i'll send you the ebook link because it's not worth it
N🆗ri (Marisa): hardcover $78 no way omg
N🆗ri (Marisa): http://longfiles.com/w6nzebfkbx8x/Costuming_Cosplay_Dressing_the_Imagination.pdf.html
Andrew: Have you found literrature thats more objexctive too?
Andrew: Ty btw
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah, i have a ton of academic weeb literature ~~whenever we had free reign to pick a topic guess what i did it on~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): cosplay literature is hard to come by in a non-historical sense
N🆗ri (Marisa): how many of you use the cosplanner app
i'm waiting for it to re-download now but i remember it didn't have that many functions
Aldus Larian (Jess): I use it sometimes
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it just a checklist? or is there more?
Aldus Larian (Jess): You can put like weather you have to buy or make something and it gives you like a "percent" done thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think there's some other stuff?
Andrew: i use to use it
Andrew: havent in a long time
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm. it has updated a lot and has some more features
Andrew: I realize i still need to buy gloves and boots for naofumi
N🆗ri (Marisa): sowwy i probably won't use it much
i wish it had. like. a cascading check box or something
because i can write "wig" in the to-do section but i need to break it down a lot further
Andrew: Dont think ill be able to make them
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can send you glove patterns
Andrew: I cant sew
N🆗ri (Marisa): believe in urself
Andrew: Well see
Andrew: Send it to me in the meantime
Andrew: Im gonna order the boots
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a bunch what kind do you need, do you have a picture of the gloves?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo fingerless
Andrew: ya
N🆗ri (Marisa): so like, brown fingerless fur-trimmed gloves with bracers over them
Andrew: yes
Andrew: exactly
N🆗ri (Marisa): you might need to combine patterns <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): this has some good ones to start
http://dr-cos.info/#Gloves
Andrew: i dont know where to start
N🆗ri (Marisa): g l o v e s!
Andrew: ow boots are expensive
Andrew: and long processing tiem
N🆗ri (Marisa): boots can be made
N🆗ri (Marisa): wrap ur legs in seran wrap and duct tape
Andrew: do i ahve legiotimate alternatives to buying them from online
N🆗ri (Marisa): make 'em
Andrew: you have a lot of faith in my ability here
N🆗ri (Marisa): i make most of my cosplay shoes, is easy
they look atrocious but the steps are simple if you just take your time and don't start them 2 days before the con
N🆗ri (Marisa): or if you don't wanna make the whole boot just get simple boots and add the fur/top part
Andrew: I was thinking something like that
Andrew: Where can i get these boots then
Andrew: or do i ame them too
Andrew: Im not opposed
Andrew: I just need assistance and guidance
N🆗ri (Marisa): make 'em!! <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
