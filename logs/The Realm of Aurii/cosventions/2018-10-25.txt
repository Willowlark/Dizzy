Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo yea I saw that I'm expecting 40 raylas 10 Claudias and nothing else
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i started making tiny wings (that'll fit into my bookbag) to wear to the cosplay event on Sunday but honestly it looks HUGE and I don't think I'm gonna wear them. Despite being in the same location as other cosplay events it's super different. The location isn't "the park outside of sunshine city" it's literally officially listed as all of "East Ikebukuro"
Total Nok-out (Marisa): *the event has its own theme song*
