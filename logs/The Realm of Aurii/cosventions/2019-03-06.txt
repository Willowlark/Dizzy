Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Everyone doing BNHA makes me wanna do BNHA 😭😭
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^ same
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but also UGhHH
Bill: I’d lol but I was going to consider Mirio again.
Aldus Larian (Jess): same but i just dropped 100 on raven
Bill: Woot!
Aldus Larian (Jess): sept not everyone is doing bnha so im low key regret, especially if Georgia switches
Bill: Can you cancel the order?
Bill: And either way, it’s still good for another con!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh no I ain’t switching, I just dropped 90 on Starfire lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe I’ll do Uraraka for formal instead of Pyrrha
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless you wanna switch which day were doing it them im in XD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MMMMM realistically it’s stupid to try to do fem todo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s like 60 bucks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I’d probably have to flip Starfire with Lux or Yona
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Then again... if I change into Starfire later in the day, I’m not stuck in body paint all morning
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmm nah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll just do Uraraka with this rose dress I have for the for alc
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What cosplays did you wanna bring Jess?
Aldus Larian (Jess): well lemme know, i have no set plans so if u wanna do TT another day over the weekend thats coo
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh ill prob do mina if i do bnha atall and then raven as long as everything goes as planned, uh idk what else
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do Star and Raven earlier in the day and then BNHA later?
Bill: Bodypaint.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Possible tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh shit you rite
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Starfire for me is just my face not my whole body
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea but id have to do grey, then shower, then repeat with pink
Bill: ~~Nejire?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Unless you did Nejire
Aldus Larian (Jess): and i dont really wanna do to many costume changes at zenkai
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also valid
Aldus Larian (Jess): like one in the mooring and maybe change around 4 for 1 in the evening
Bill: That's a good plan.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeaaah I think I’ll just do Starfire and then change into Uraraka formal stuff whenever
Bill: I imagine Nejire would be boring for a big con tbh, but one day it'd be fun to do Big three again when we can a non blown out shoot.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll probably switch out canon stafire for piccolo Starfire when I get tired
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jess you have piccolo ravens shirt right?

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ;3c
Aldus Larian (Jess): Georgia's trying to lure Tom in with promises of roller blading
Bill: ... You should probably invite Noah. If Ethan meets and likes him, you may be able to solve your groomsmen pair off issue. Or at the least lock in a +1 for the wedding.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I will tell you right now. Ethan isn't going to make someone a groomsman because they are a bridesmaids boyfriend. But you might be able to get a plus 1
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tru and noah plays bass
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and ethan has a big man boner for music
