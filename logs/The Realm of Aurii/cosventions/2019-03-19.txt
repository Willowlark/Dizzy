Bill: Too small for me anyway.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Erik if you wanna yeet the wig to me at zenkai I can try and fix it for next time you wanna do him 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If you want to take a crack at it you're more than welcome to. Thanks 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But it's got that thing going on where there's a bunch of really short strands at the roots that make it really thicc and poofy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye I can try to wrangle it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's a fun challenge either way
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I kind of got the part looking better using the wet rag and iron trick lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I need a mannequin head that's true to size. I got it looking pretty okay buy then I put it on and it looked like garbage again
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It looks okayish, but only on the mannequin
Bill: Oh that does look way better.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But only when the mannequin wears it
Bill: *swap heads with the mannequin*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Still looks huge on my head
Bill: It look pretty good tho?
N🆗ri (Marisa): imagine jumin with sillybandz
N🆗ri (Marisa): just like 50 cat-shaped rubber bands on his wrists
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg that looks so much better
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it'll work... ~*squints suspiciously*~ for now...
Aldus Larian (Jess): It work 🙌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe I can thin out the underside on top
Elfriede Faun (Tom): nicu!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.kasouwig.com/mystic-messenger-jumin-han-side-parted-natural-black-cosplay-wig-p0791.html
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Note for next time...
Andrew: Got anew follower on insta tonight, havent posted in a year.

N🆗ri (Marisa): Is anyone going to anime Boston
A stranger wants to recruit me into their cosplay group there so now I desire to go
N🆗ri (Marisa): But it’s like. So soon. Rip.
Bill: Nah.
Bill: Too much travel.
Bill: I want to, but the vacation days.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Take them and go
N🆗ri (Marisa): How do I turn them down there goes my one chance at ever being useful to someone 
“Pls send pics of your cosplay group anyway I wanna see” that’s really weird to say right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd love to go to a New England con someday but ye vacation days
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): NY crew wanted to recruit me for a STRQ group back at NYE but I dunno where their plans for that went lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): RIP lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was like "Oh definitely! When?" and Lex said maybe Anime Boston and I was like oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Will's also been trying to get me to go to Anime Boston
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe next year I'll make that a con to go to. I've never been to Boston and I'd love to go
Bill: I wanna do boston, Georgia did iirc, Andrew Aaron and John were wanting to go...
Bill: It's literally just yet another con ™ and it's 4-6 hours away like Katsu so that's a half day/friday off...
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know a ton of people who go every year. This is the first time in a decade anyone’s recruited me for a cosplay group so I was like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s in Historic Boston™ tho imagine all the culture
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's really fun
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): However it's usually freezing, unless they moved the dates
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So like outside photos were always hard
N🆗ri (Marisa): April 20th weekend
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Blaze it
Bill: oh and it's usually smack on top of easter right?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea
Bill: my family ain't big easter people but it's still like, not a holiday I wanna yeet out for.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHY THEY DO THAT THO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like that’s so inconvenient
Bill: Some people don't do easter?
Bill: idk.
Bill: AB is a goal one day.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof yeah, Easter is a priority in my family
N🆗ri (Marisa): easter is the day that precedes a big chocolate sale
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's why people celebrate it right
N🆗ri (Marisa): The head is a nice shape, just not for meowth <:thinku:543194478614413318> imma finish it but hopes are low
N🆗ri (Marisa): Always make mockups kids <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): longer fur would definitely look better but also cost $50
Bill: oof that require bank.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye it'd be cheaper to buy a shag rug or towel than the fabric itself
N🆗ri (Marisa): since this sucks i don't know what to cosplay on sunday anymore. maybe if i can find the wig i'll just whip up another necklace and do chise.
Bill: Why don't you do one of your many, MANY, old cosplays.
Bill: I guess Chise is that but.
Bill: One you don't have to do more work for.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i cosplayed chise at the last zenkaikon i went to
do i have any costumes that i don't need to do more work for
N🆗ri (Marisa): karuta but i wore her to katsucon
Bill: aaaand? if you'll have a fun why not.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's fun
Bill: What you should have at cons.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've been in such a funk for a while i just want to throw myself out the window. i dunno why, everything is great and i'm so lucky yet i utterly despite myself
Bill: You been getting out of your house?
Bill: Spending too much time inside could do that to you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i go to the office
Bill: anything that's not for work?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've spent months inside with no ill side effects
N🆗ri (Marisa): i got my haircut after going to my aunt's house on st. patrick's day. there were only 5 of us but i guess no one could hear me talking because i would be in the middle of a story and i'd get cut off or i'd ask a question and no one would answer.
Bill: you caught wanting friendship!
Bill: lol that happens to me all the time. I lol, I hate it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm in such a depressive state it's giving me constant headaches and chest pains. bojo says maybe it's a chemical imbalance or something.
Bill: 😭
Bill: Zenkai stress?
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry
N🆗ri (Marisa): no not at all i just utterly despise myself
Bill: no fucking sorrys.
Bill: We care about you, so talk about what ailes you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wish not to bother and you shouldn't care about me
N🆗ri (Marisa): y'all have lives
Bill: You only bother me when you beat around the bush.
Bill: And no one tells me who I care about. Period.
Bill: I care about who I do.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i never beat around the bush ever name one time i've ever done that eve
Bill: -_-
N🆗ri (Marisa): like idk. i'm constantly sad because i'm an absolutely useless talentless disgusting waste of resources who contributes nothing to society and who'd be better fed as fertilizer to the plants or incinerated? 🤷 this isn't anything new
N🆗ri (Marisa): zenkaikon can at least force me to do something for 96 hours
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah i gotta find a costume
N🆗ri (Marisa): do people still cosplay neko atsume
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg
N🆗ri (Marisa): how popular is hooky. i could move dani to sunday and do chise thursday.
N🆗ri (Marisa): eh dont matter ill have my shirt on anyway
Bill: That's rough, and is depression... I don't think you're useless at all, or any of the other many adjectives you used.  It's okay you feel that way. I wish I could tell you the solution to sadness but there isn't. You have to suffer for awhile and have faith you'll move past it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah. i appreciate the words but it's not going away, this has been around in various levels for at least 8 years it's just life. i just have to get over myself.
N🆗ri (Marisa): when you get told you're a useless mistake it sits with you for a while
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo i can cosplay mirai with my glasses
Bill: I'm not the best with the emotional side of things, I know... I'm the problem solver and let Jess handle the matters of the heart. Self love is a bitch to master, I dun't know how to do it either. You aren't alone.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have sylvia <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: You have *us* silly.
Bill: And you certainly aren't useless. If not for you, Aurii would have never had a hope of reviving. You kept rps up during the hiatus, were the first one to get things ready for the new game... You're the biggest fan. I notice that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i didn't do anything, the quest sucks and i keep lapsing on updates. i just filled out a character sheet. i pester the chat constantly because i have nothing to do with my life.
Bill: You underestimate how valuable that is.
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is such a cute meowth
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh where's my mari cosplay that could work
Bill: I could try and sell you on the greatest thing ever, but unless someone takes a first step the thing will fade away.
Bill: You know how many projects I've had no one to take that first step? More than I can count.
Bill: So you may think your actions were minor, but *I* didn't.
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank ur stuff is cool
Bill: Thank you for supporting it over and over again.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but it cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): everyone love it
Bill: Sure. You're the one creating and ready to go though. Your the one who asks about when can we do more.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah so when is aurii season 2
N🆗ri (Marisa): pressure
N🆗ri (Marisa): since the theme is yokai i'll use my selkie stuff and be a fox maid
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/100024662132161/posts/387524762079592?sfns=mo

Bill: https://petapixel.com/2019/03/19/how-a-joint-photo-shoot-helped-me-understand-style/
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee I like the fox maid look. My staff shirt is red I think so that’ll match, and our team color is green so I can tie that around my arm.
N🆗ri (Marisa): terra also has 4 giant functional pockets for any holding needs
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo cute
Bill: CUTE
N🆗ri (Marisa):

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): owo
N🆗ri (Marisa): gotta start getting cryptic
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: What part of ban do you not understand.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That was a mere colorblind test. Harmless. Making sure everyone can see properly.
Bill: I can see the real purpose JUST fine.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia):
