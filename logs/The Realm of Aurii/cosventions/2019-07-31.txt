El🆓de Faun (Tom): oh is that from tjhat amazoon show
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yeah!@
El🆓de Faun (Tom): it a fly hat
El🆓de Faun (Tom): shes the actress that plays the garbage queen in the walking dead i think
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i am wrong
El🆓de Faun (Tom): prob dumb question
El🆓de Faun (Tom): patterns usually include seam allowances right?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): dont need to add that on top of it?
Nokri (Marisa): Uuuuusually they do if you buy them but sometimes they don’t. It depends on the pattern :0
Nokri (Marisa): If you’re unsure it should say somewhere on the pattern. It’s usually indicated by some kind of line
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :0
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yeah it looks like it says something about it
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i should learn to read instructions before asking questions
El🆓de Faun (Tom): my bad
El🆓de Faun (Tom): thanks tho!
Nokri (Marisa): Call out for this guy who hit “reply all” to tell someone he finished a survey
El🆓de Faun (Tom): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Goddammit Josh!
Bill: It’s amusing how many cancellations saikoucon has announced.
Bill: O Katy coming to the bars this weekend. That’ll be nice.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): what the fuck saikou is at a resort?
Bill: We knew this...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): totally forgot\
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): saikou hasnt been on my aradar
Nokri (Marisa): I went to a con once in a massage parlor. The video games were each in a tiny little massage room and people had to sit on the beds. It was weird.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats weird
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i checked out the cosplay guests that they have
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): sub 1k followers
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i feel so bad for saikoucon lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): they were really good like 3 years back and just declined
Nokri (Marisa): omg yeah my friend was a cosplay guest there one year and she doesn’t make her cosplays, she gets them off amazon
Nokri (Marisa): Not really sure what’s up with them
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sweet I can be a cosplay guest
Nokri (Marisa): I can see them having guests with small followings as long as they have the know-how but I think SaikouCon is just yoloing it 

Yes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): saikou had a kink panel 3 years back and it was amazing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i still think about it to this day
El🆓de Faun (Tom): SAIKOUS AT A RESORT?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEA
El🆓de Faun (Tom): WoAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i know nothing about this con at all
El🆓de Faun (Tom): in fact
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ive thought it was Psykou or Psycho or Psykao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): this whole time
El🆓de Faun (Tom): sicko mode
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): a con for psychos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lets all apply to be guests and take over the con
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o wow the voice of yuri from angel beats will be there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.instagram.com/koreylynnn/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.instagram.com/iamwildspice/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.instagram.com/8BITAmbitions/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.instagram.com/theonetrueelsa/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): theres the guests
Nokri (Marisa): Oh I know 8bit and elsa
Nokri (Marisa): 8bit used to do photography
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn I got more followers than 3 of them that nuts
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Awww poor psycho con
Nokri (Marisa): It could be that they’re listed as guests because they’re doing a lot of panels
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo maybe
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Pfft the band that they said is playing there is called the cucks
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t think their number of followers has much to do with anything
Yeah conventions pick famous people to be guests but unless you’re Yaya Han no one’s gonna care
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Still don't know how geekdom got all three nier voices
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk they used to have guests with followers in the 10k range
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): they judged the costume contest
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also I've somehow not known who yaya is til this moment
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she has the fabric line!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): How did I avoid that for this long
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my first Blake ears were Yaya Han ears
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my second ears are much better <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lets become saikou famous guys
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and _take over a whole con_
Nokri (Marisa): When jalissa was a SaikouCon guest she just ran like 4-5 panels
Nokri (Marisa): No table or autographs or anything
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Is it just saicocon that lists thier guests like that or just a smaller con thing to do?
Nokri (Marisa): Each con does it differently
Aldus Larian (Jess): CCEs prob having a hand in saikou going down I'd imagine
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i always thought the rationale was to have guests that would attract attendees?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Same area, pretty close in date, saikou costs more too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and provides a lot less
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
Nokri (Marisa): The guests you listed are special guests or something, not the same category as the voice actor and famous guests
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ooo i thought cosplay guests had the same intent
Nokri (Marisa): Naw, they’re probably just to spread information. Like I imagine 8bit would give photography and editing and “cosplay for everyone” panels while Elsa does sewing and design panels and whatnot. Plus it makes them seem more approachable that they aren’t famous so more people are likely to ask them questions
Nokri (Marisa): Minecraft bunny girls were popular at Otakon I see a lot of people talking about them
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I saw them at katsu but not ota
Bill: You know where I would do a panel? Kotori. Maybe.
Bill: Small, but not like. Kogara.
Nokri (Marisa): That’s how I got 3 badges to kotori one year <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa's panel was hoppin at kogara tho
Bill: *true* she filled the room.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~that was kogara right?~~
Bill: ~~ye~~
Bill: I am not famous panelist Mawisa-chan tho, so gotta aim for a bigger crowd.
Nokri (Marisa): my panel sucked u can do better
Bill: But like. If I were to a photography panel, ~~cause what else would I do asides from an hour long rant on RWBY,~~ because I'm entirely self taught I'd be waiting for like... someone to raise there hand and be like "AcTuAlLy there's better ways of doing that"
Bill: Hush Marisa your panel was very good.
Nokri (Marisa): no urs will be
Bill: no u
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://tenor.com/view/why-not-both-gif-11478682
Nokri (Marisa): There can only be one <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I'm not the one saying the panel would suck. =T
Bill: I just wonder if being self taught will make it more confusing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmmm maybe?
Aldus Larian (Jess): if i tried to teach anyone anything i taught myself it would be really hard
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe I’ll submit a panel to Zenkaikon so I can get a free badge
Bill: ye!
Aldus Larian (Jess): new panel? same panel?
Aldus Larian (Jess): your panel was really good so you could totally do it again
Nokri (Marisa): I’m not sure what it’d be on. I could do a trivia gameshow but there are usually plenty of gameshow panels, I could do one of the panels I’ve done in the past but I feel like the intro panel isn’t necessary at zenkai and the history one was really meh
Aldus Larian (Jess): i though it was interesting
Nokri (Marisa): because u r angle
Nokri (Marisa): so hevenly
Bill: I read that as single and almost had a heart attack.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: I mean, I have literally no interest in history of any kind, weeb or not, and your panel was enjoyable so that's how good you did presenting it.
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Nokri (Marisa): I bet sensei still has our presentations on her ipad. I wonder if she ever sits and watches them with popcorn
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah that was an interesting panel
Nokri (Marisa): Rick and Morty cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): is it bad if i edit some shadows to make a girl look slimmer
i'm not going to edit her actual bodyshape or weight
but there's a shadow/seam where she might be wearing shorts that might be unflattering and i want her to feel good about the pictures so would it be messed up of me to remove that shadow
i'll post pic
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): is it messed up if i edit it to this
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I don't think so personally
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's just changing the sun to better light someone
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It'd be the same thing if you did it irk by just moving her
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i dont think so either
Nokri (Marisa): oki <:pwease:555585508819075112> i don't want to get called out for fatshaming or being fatphobic or anything, but i'm just changing that one shadow i hope she doesn't mind hhh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): First of all she won't know!
Nokri (Marisa): unless she zooms in super super close but i'm trying to hide all evidence of tampering
Nokri (Marisa): what if..... i opened her right eye a little more
too much editing?
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nah I think it's totally fine to do but if you go too crazy you'll make so much work for yourself
Nokri (Marisa): then i will suffer
Bill: Yeah I wouldn't get that detailed to do the eye. Not worth the effort, especially for a full body shot. The attention isn't going to be on the face, it's going to be on the outfit.
Nokri (Marisa): the cosplayer will look at their face tho, i've gotten pictures back where my eye looks weird and i don't want to post them because weird eye
Nokri (Marisa): how does this sky look
Nokri (Marisa): too fake?
Nokri (Marisa): i can't remember what color the sky is aaaaaaaaaaaa
Tikur (Kurtis): Look like sky
Aldus Larian (Jess): just a little lighter cluw maybe?
Nokri (Marisa): lighter?
Nokri (Marisa): i'll just put the opacity on 50% hh
Aldus Larian (Jess): *hacked*
Nokri (Marisa): SKY: HACKED
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): here's the original u can play spot the difference if u want
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Woah that looks so good
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I love the "adventure"
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Sign thing
El🆓de Faun (Tom): W O R S H I P
Tikur (Kurtis): 🎶*I used to worship at your altar*🎶
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I heard that to hotline bling I hope you meant it that way
Nokri (Marisa): I read it in the same way as “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Understandable
