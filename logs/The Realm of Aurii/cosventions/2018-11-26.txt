Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): so I talked with Hal
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): <@!184437198865563648> he said hes most likely bailing on the rooms with Mac and will prob be messaging you about it "soon"
Bill: Weeeee
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): so thatll clear things up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): WEEEEE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Freedom my dudes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wonder if thats related to his opinion dissent earlier
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): i kinda brought it up
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): off hand
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you asked if he was still comfy rooming with us?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nah i was a lil more blunt than that :3
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _did you just tell him to gtfo_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): *Not that blunt*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I brought up katsu after talking about some stuff about him not being able to talk to you anymore
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oh he said he still cant talk to me?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i had assumed as much
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Not in a "I can't talk to her cuz it's too fresh eay*"
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Just that he doesn't know how or something in that direction
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _really_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Anyways I mentioned how early you said you thought about dropping the room and he said, that helll drop
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He was planning on it anyways tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _interesting_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): maybe hes lessened on the hard-edged asshole route he was taking earlier
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~or is realizing that the group is making him out to be a bad guy at this rate~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah seems that way,
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He  refused to bring up recent events like yesterday lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And was concerned that people might be spreading rumors
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Cuz of Ethan I think
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): did you tell him that people are spreading rumors? üòÇ
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _cause ethan and hunter totally were_
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): omg I knew he was gonna bail but I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be so rude as to delay it after knowing already
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I told him bne wasn't
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Not that he's dating her, but that he was dating her BEFORE you guys broke up
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): I think Biru said Hal swore up and down he‚Äôd stay and now look
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He wanted to be sure everyone knew she wasn't the reason
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He still seems a bit lost on everything as usual
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): why havent they told anyone that theyre dating then?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): No clue
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats the weird part, by not saying it, theyre feeding into the rumors LOL
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He didn't mention Meg
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its a self fulfilling prophecy
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But he knows I knoe
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): which means Aurii at least knows
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which means probably BNE
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I figured he'd ask me
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But he didn't
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He was semi hung up that some conspiracy was forming against him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~it sorta is~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like lightly but it was there
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But see here's the thing
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Not in the way he thinks
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): what does he think, we're trying to plot to kick him out of BNE?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He doesn't realize that he's burying himself
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He was thinking (some speculation on my part)
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That ethan was essentially spreading bad rumors about him (the untrue kind) and was making it so everyone didn't like him
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Not realizing that literally the only reason people aren't liking him right now is what he's saying in public
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): when the actuality is that ethan is exposing the truth that theyre dating and everyones still judging them for it....
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like he thinks people are mad at him for breaking up with you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): true, his attitude has gotten him in the MOST trouble
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ethan's not in BNE anymore right? i thought he was ousted by everyone. or do people still hang with him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): though erik and leanna and rebecca had some WORDS to say about him dating Meg so soon after
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): People are mad at him because of the times he's being a dick
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): very tru
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats why rebecca messaged me yesterday
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh and he was still hung up on the stupid konkon vote
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): LOL REALLY
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _good_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He thought that everyone that went to the Halloween party had like came to a decision
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And voted the same
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): that we decided on the theme at halloween?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): LOL
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tom thank you for sharing such information
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im kinda glad hes not purposely being an asshole at least
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes just.... stupid
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "ok guys lets sit down in the middle of our halloween party and have a lengthy planning discussion"
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Most of the conversation was actually pretty decent (like when we weren't talking about drama) so I'm glad, but there are a few things that are just wrong about his viewpoints
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And he's paranoid
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes always been paranoid so that sounds about right
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im getting a feeling he plays more league when hes uneasy too
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he was particularly upsetti the one time i talked to him instead of letting him play league
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah, he's also been playing with Ryan alot
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): So get this
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ryan started playing
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Because
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Specifically star gaurdian
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~COPING MECHANISM CONSPIRACY THEORIES OWO~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): wow ryan u copy cat

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~you know im a sucker for those~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Pretty much, he's like caught up on dumb things
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): SOUNDS LIKE HAL
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): the tl;dr is hes not deliberately trying to be an asshole, hes paranoid, and still being dumb
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He was worried that you might have told people that you broke up for like different reasons or something
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Literally just paranoid
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah he mentioned that to others immediately after the break up
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I told him.no obviously
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he was like "i just know georgia is gonna twist this around to make me seem like the bad guy"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like no buddy you did that yourself
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He seemed to accept everything I said at least
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ?????? you would never do that wow
~~even though he is the bad guy~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): because youre tom
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he wants to like you ofc
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao ‚≠ê
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean i WAS  a little gossip-y, ill admit, but it was both interesting stuff and talking about it helped me cope
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah but you didn't lie
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Talking about what actually happened isn't an issue
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And tbh no one in bne was mad at Hal for breaking up with you,
It was sad ofc, but that's not where it's coming from
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): The bne negativity ce afterward
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Cuz of the things he said in chat
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah he made an ass of himself
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): yeah right afterwards it seemed there was more confusion and concern about it than hostility towards anyone
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and people were really speculating about him and meg
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But he didn't ask that part
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Cuz he doesn't see
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): The damage he's doing to himself
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): social sudoku
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): did you point out that he was digging his own grave?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And i can't just bring it up if he's completely blind to it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): SOCIAL SUDOKU
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like I *can* and I thought about it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah you cant just be like "no buddy.... people dislike you... because youre actually being a jerk..."
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But I didn't want to give his conspiracy theories and traction
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean hes just gonna keep acting this way and alienating those around him so ü§∑
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Plus the state of mind he's in, he's just not gonna get it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~he never thinks hes the one in the wrong~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~him and ethan butted heads particularly for that reason~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It's like, you can't teach calc to a grade schooler
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): So I feel like I can't tell him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats uh...... kinda indicative of the maturity thing if you ask for my humble onion
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Exactly what you said before, if he never thinks he's wrong then he can't accept me saying that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean if you say it he may consider that idea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): or think about that particular explanation after all others have been exhausted
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah, but I just don't know where he'll take it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): wait so does that mean he actually wants to contact me? nani?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It becomes like a wild card
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah he does
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _weird_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He wants to be on speaking terms
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And he also wants to give you the pyhrra figure and shirt lmao
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): huh
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats a surprise
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like ........................ why
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _i will accept the offerings but that doesnt mean ill accept speaking terms_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): What he's saying and doing is contradictory I know
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao true
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): it IS
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'm sure he'll bring it up if he messages you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he argues with me in chat and then says in private that he wants to be on speaking terms
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): *cracks knuckles* lets hope he messages me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): really tho, break up aside, im very frustrated with him as a human being
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah same.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): didn't he also say in private he didn't want to talk at all? such confused.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes been a real jerk, and hes neglecting his schoolwork, and probably is under his moms thumb again
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he hasnt made any progress in his life, and he said he needed a break up specifically for one of the reasons being to sort out his shit
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like he's fine to talk to about bullshit things but, otherwise, I can't agree with his decisions, and esp things he's saying in public chat
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): when in reality hes probably partied and smoked more, especially since meg
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): "only tiny peens use fire and ice condoms"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): YEAH WELL FUK U
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): *goes buys a 300 pack*
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): middle finger emoji
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): actually now that i think about it, hal is probably better telling BNE that he and meg are dating
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): it exists i'm just too scared to react with it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but hes better off NOT posting about it on social media
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but BNE should know
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It's true
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _otherwise everyones like boohoo poor georgia_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Everyone knows anyways in reality
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah! and him keeping it a secret is making him look bad, and for some, feeding the fire of "omg did hal cheat"
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah,
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i dont subscribe to that theory, i think he had thoughts of meg, and thats a big reason for breaking it off, but he wasnt explicitly unfaithful
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): because "i dont like your bossy attitude" is frankly a bullshit excuse LOL
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He pretty much asked me in super roundabout terms if I thought that Meg was the reason for the breakup
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I agree with you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): mess with him, say everyone thinks we broke up cause of meg LOLOL
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): no tom ur too nice for that
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I think that he was just generally unhappy with things and Meg was also a background thought
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): also "i dont like your bossy attitude", if it was the real reason, is such a small thing he shouldve thought of telling me before breaking up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes not really one for conflict
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so if he was having issues with me (as one sided as they were) then he was just gonna evade it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean i worried about meg for a reason
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): shes pretty, she lives 5 minutes away from him, theyre carbon copies of immaturity and party-people-ness
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): on surface level, theyre more compatible
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think frankly hal and i are better off with our respective people
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah, although if they keep it up they won't last
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i always appreciated that hal was my opposite in a lot of ways, but i guess those types of relationships also call for compromise and we werent doing that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): o rly you think?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I do
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Granted I've never seen them in person but they can't maintain a relationship the way they are
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _secretively_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): The secretiveness,
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): it seems like it's going to implode
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): not to mention meg is super scared of emotions and commitment, whats that about
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah!
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Is one, but the problems that he had with your relationship will prob just form again
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And that yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah he hasnt learned from him and i yet
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so history is likely to repeat itself
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): tom are you hiding your online status to hide from hal hehe
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Anyways, Hal is still Hal, surprise surprise
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yes hehehe
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): heheheehehe
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): WOW MUCH SURPRISE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): VERY SHOCK
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _hal has no character development, shocker_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oof
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): bad novel 0/10
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ill reiterate that im glad hes not deliberately trying to be a bad guy tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes just stupid
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): surprisngly aggressive for a stupid person i guess
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but whatever?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like fighting me in chat yesterday, he didnt say shit til meg took a problem with it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like honestly meg got all up about "call out culture" ~~she sounded like a SJW oof~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah and Meg's response showed she was clearly heated about it
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Prob cuz of ethan
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But she shouldn't speak to you that way cuz she can't control her emotions that Ethan "gave her"
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ~~how would she have handled it if it happened to her then~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): not to mention, she didnt speak up beforehand
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah exactly
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and when hal spoke, he agreed that it was hilarious
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): his hypocrisy is also weird
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hal is just acting weird
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): very strangely, i think meg is taking advantage of him being a pushover perchange
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _he is a pushover that much is true_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeet
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I will say I don't think him and Meg are trying to be dicks, Meg is just emotional and not committed and Hal is as you said
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Kinda dumb with these things
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ~~is it possible he has a minor manifestation of paranoid schizophrenia~~
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ye i don't think they're trying to turn people against them on purpose
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean i think its rude to date friends exes as well
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that's also a thing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but maybe i thought of meg as more of a friend than she did of me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~which is a huge insecurity for most people that theyre more attached to others oof~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah..
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): BUT with that said
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): They aren't off the hook, they still we're dicks
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ye
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Hopefully they stop
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wonder whatll happen if they dont shape up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you think BNE would do something?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Although I told my friend Jared some of the stuff Hal said
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): if not explicitly, subtly?
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): a coup d'etat
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And she said
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): WERE STAGING A COUP
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Esp yesterday
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And he said:
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah he needs to go
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I LIKE JARED ALREADY
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): :boot em from the server, he's toxic
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you think it would get that far?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): We're his exact words
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nah prob not
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He cares about how much people like him too much
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): it would prob get to an intervention before that
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That too
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): HE DOES CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): AND HE SAID I WAS DUMB FOR THINKING THAT
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _and then did exactly that_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yepyep
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i have so much beef with hal in hindsight, i let a lot slide cause i loved him
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah and you just don't really think about it in that much detail you know?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): You don't until you do
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah i was like "hypocritical, but ok"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): anyways
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im glad hes not purposely being a jerk
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): realistically speaking, hal and i are both with people that are more compatible with who we are as a person
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hal is with a partier thats coasting in classes, being social, and smoking
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im with another physics major that has geeky interests and the same sense of humor
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): the world balances itself out
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i must sleeps now because i have class
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): True and true

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): WERE THERE ANY LAST JUICY DEATS?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _leave no detail out_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nah , hals still pretty predictable, I'm sure you can fill in the details
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's was pretty much it tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you shot the shit and he hinted about his paranoia/insecurities without being particularly forthright
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): that sounds like the gist of it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he likes to act like stuffs ok and thats gonna kill him later
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Anyways night Georgia (and Noah), night Marisa!

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Didnt someone mention latley that Hal seems to not value female opinion as much?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hunter? I think mentioned it
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): yeah i think there was a big discussion about that here idk about bne
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz I'd like to point out that Hal has asked Tom for advice a few times now and hasn't even talked to me <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He either doesn't care what I have to say or he's scared of me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz usually Tom and I get treated pretty equally
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i bet it's fear

No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): in all honesty i was never really sure what to make of hal. i met him irl...... twice? ~~though i've only met y'all like 2/3 times oops~~
but his online presence was/is confusing
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i guess to put it in words maybe he never wanted to talk to me? which is highly understandable 100% and also makes sense in the whole "doesn't care about female opinions" light
so his whole personality to me is just ????
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea he is v. Confusing
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): hhhhhhhhhhey biru
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): look at this fun mess
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But yeah he has talked to me twice since the break up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ones to ask for Tom cuz he wasn't answers hals messages cuz he was in the shower
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): omg really
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): And the other was a 4 messages total
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "tom pls respond"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Which basically asked me to be there for Georgia? Like as if I wouldn't be?
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): you know us girls. gotta comfort the other girls. gotta be gal pals.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): gorls
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i get sad people never message me but also i never respond to 95% of messages and freak out when I do get messages <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "why don't people chat with me" i whisper in solitude as i look at my 83 unopened messages
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mood
Bill: That‚Äôs a read.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): biru what do 4 katsu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also a mood
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I spent like 15 mins catching up
Bill: Pretty much yeah.
Bill: Hal‚Äôs an idiot if he thought *I* was mad at him for breaking up with Georgia. But we already knew he‚Äôs an idiot.
Bill: Though I believe he‚Äôs was as dense as Georgia was about it.
Bill: We have 7 for Katsu if the two of them drop, which is the worst possible combination.
Bill: Not enough for two rooms and too many for one.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): perfect fit for 1 room <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You could try offering to Erik but he's prob gonna air BnB
Bill: I already did, to him and Leanna.
Bill: Both refused.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): passive agressive post in bne like "hey guys some people rooming with us dropped out and we're in a pinch"
Bill: Yeah I‚Äôm not looking to stir the pot with Hal. I‚Äôm happy to just have him gone.
Bill: And as for Hal, everyone made out better. Pulling the bandage off sucked, but things weren‚Äôt great and now their better than before.
Bill: I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever win me over as friend (he never did in the first place) but he‚Äôll branch out and meet some people he can actually see routinely. School, Delaware locals.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ~~if he goes to school~~
Bill: He doesn‚Äôt have to.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Hal needs to officially message you too
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): is the current room number a major issue
i really don't want to and i think everyone is already full (8 people :3c), but i could send out feelers to other rooms
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): YEAH that's the messed up thing about it
Bill: I‚Äôll get to ‚Äúchecking‚Äù eventually.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): if he knew he needs to say so
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hal never knows üòÇ
Bill: He‚Äôs incompetent as far as room stuff ~~or responsibilities in general~~ go. He‚Äôs always been that way.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Anything he's always back and forth in everything
Bill: My standards are probably a little high cause I‚Äôm neurotic, but he‚Äôs always been bad.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It wouldn't even surprise me if hes planning on keeping this room in his back pocket until he has a new one
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): that's such a neener thing to do omg
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i'm gonna fight him
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He a neener, fight him
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~jk don't actuator fight him~~
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i'm gonna do it
Bill: Just let shit be.
Bill: Georgia is fine and happy now, we don‚Äôt have to go guns blazing, and like I said it‚Äôs not the first time he‚Äôs slighted me in room planning. I dealt with it before and will now.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Dude she's kidding calm down
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ~~am i jess. am i kidding~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
