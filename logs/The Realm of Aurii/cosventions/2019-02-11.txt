NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ok biru this is my reminder that i have to pay you today
i ordered printer ink so i can properly print my sticker valentine business card things
then all i need to do is style all the wigs, paint emma and ray's wigs make katarina's collar, finish the gold decals on her skirt, attach the skirt to the dress, finish the jacket, make an attach the jacket fasteners, finish the boots and replace the grommets that fell off, put soles in the boots, make the gloves, finish ray's coat, make corn's accessories that i lost, take in ray's waistcoat, make katarina's cravat, finish the hoop skirt, finish the edges of the skirt, add ribbon, and we're good to go.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i think i'll hand sew the gloves because those are a pain to machine stitch
OH and i have to make ray's gloves yeah
Bill: Is that *all*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): when i was doing the cutout on my new nora shirt i did it in the machine but cranked the stiches through manually it was still clow but not as slow as hand sewing and i had more control over direction
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): jaehee's lanyard but she doesnt' always have that so im not worried, i can grab one at a dollar store
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): oo that's clever
gloves are just a pain because they need to be so precise and these ones don't stretch at all so i have to make sure i get the fingertips and in between the fingers perfectly bluhh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Handsewing doesnâ€™t take too long I could finish them within an hour if I donâ€™t get distracted
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Fuckin A2, pain in my ass
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Justinâ€™s coming over now to paint the Android lines on my tights
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But idk how long thatâ€™ll take, and the tank top is soooo annoying so far to sew
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I donâ€™t even like the one Iâ€™m halfway done with now oof
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ðŸ˜­
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I wish I could buy just the tank
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats a mood
Bill: Just donâ€™t melt down over it. You arenâ€™t committed to a shoot with anyone but me, you can drop it if need be. Iâ€™d rather you not blow a fuse.
Bill: *I see you typing that goes for you too Mawisa*
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i was gonna say if anyone cancels a photoshoot it will cause a domino effect resulting in the end of the universe
but no pressure
Bill: Hush you. You can cancel Katarina too.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): *don't say that my sewing machine jammed five minutes ago*
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Hand sewing extravaganza letâ€™s go
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): pretty
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Not ironed rip
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Gives me good bow ideas for after Katsu tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): A2 is getting done booooois
