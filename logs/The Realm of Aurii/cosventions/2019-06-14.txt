Bill: The longer shirt makes a hell of a difference... we‚Äôll run with the rest from there. ~~it‚Äôs not a tank top but whose going to know?~~

ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Dope edit
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): But isn't chihirothe one that get see through?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Fuck. BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARDS. LMAOüòÇ üòÇ
Kaio Vermino (Lee): This is an edit for tomorrow I think when I'm not half asleep <:pew:543202259085950996> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): NAH IT STILL GOOD but I figured I'd tell ya xD

Kaio Vermino (Lee): TOMORROW MAWISA WILL BE SEE THROUGH
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: Put on kaminari again. Still much meh.
Bill: =T
Bill: There‚Äôs gotta be a way to improve the look, though I can‚Äôt fathom it atm.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *looks at it again*
Hmm... it's missing something...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ah yes, the ~~sub collar~~ choker
Bill: 
Bill: It‚Äôs covered.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Did it come with his weird upside down sunglasses?
Bill: ~~I thought it was some kind of leg band like hazel has first time looking at it.~~
Bill: Nope. Have the ear piece but I don‚Äôt see that attaching well. It‚Äôs got a cut in the back for ear but iiiiidk
Bill: Maybe it‚Äôs the same factor is I‚Äôm not ‚Äúanime boi build‚Äù like V... Hazel is fun cause he big muscle guy, and I can pretend that‚Äôs what it is. Mirio too.
Bill: Which is best dealt with by getting over it. üí™üèª
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Other than the shirt that came with it, I don't think it looks bad. The shirt looks like a crappy v-neck that's been stretched out. I think a v-neck would look better than the crew neck however, but you could just get a comfy white better fitting v-neck. A.C. Moore or Michaels might have individual white v-necks (as opposed to buying a pack of v-neck undershirts from Walmart or Target)
Bill: It‚Äôs not the end of the world no. And I appreciate the compliment. Just want to make the best of it I can. üëçüèª

The white shirt I switched to is an old shirt that was too large before I lost 20 pounds; picking up a better fitting white shirt may help. I‚Äôd be happy without the belt and/or beyblade launcher even, in his early design with an untucked shirt.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): First outfit had longer jacket too
Bill: ~~maybe I should just get that jackets are always a good choice rather than half jacket~~
Bill: Oh the pants are different too.
Bill: I guess drop gear isn‚Äôt a great solution then.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah he got like full costume change
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Unlike Kiri who literally just added sleeves lol
Bill: I thought he just got the beyblade launcher.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: I just saved those two pics for reference lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THANKS FOR DA PICS YAY
Bill: Think about it more tomorrow. Though first step is the shirt just like you said.
Bill: Welc.
Bill: https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplaygirls/comments/c0j8oj/a2_cosplay_self/ Why has doing black and white nier not come uo beofre.
Aldus Larian (Jess): PICS sorry fell asleep before i could look at them last night
