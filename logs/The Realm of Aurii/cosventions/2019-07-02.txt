Bill: Is there any plan to coordinate cosplay day(s) at Ota?
Nokri (Marisa): i think everyone's cosplaying different stuff?
Nokri (Marisa): unless most people haven't decided yet and i imagined that
Bill: Georgia is doing Toga for her one day, Erik was planning Nat on saturday but no Cap to go with it so I dunno if he flexing that. I don't think Tom and Jess have planned anything, Kurto is doing Seige with Ash and Dave last I heard... That's all I've gathered.
Nokri (Marisa): i've posted stuff i'm bringing
Bill: I missed it ><
Bill: Corn probably, cause you wanted to do that with Flora.
Nokri (Marisa): i said corn was too hot and i look too bad as corn. corn was good for outside at katsu, probably bad for outside at ota
Bill: Oh I must have tuned that out cause you're a cute Corn. =3
Nokri (Marisa): oo canon hooky swimsuits for adult monica and danny were posted
Nokri (Marisa): no u

Bill: Why not?
Bill: Which Kagura?
Nokri (Marisa): fruits basket, though i've been thinking about making love is war
