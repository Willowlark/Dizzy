Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~you just reminded me that i have to finish fem starlord~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): there are no spoilers in here btw billiam o3o
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we are careful
Bill: I gotta wait till dads birthday rip me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whens that o3o
Bill: I’m not reading scrollbacks from the week anyway.
Bill: May 10th.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OOF
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~see it on your own first~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): He back :0
Bill: Alright folks con booking drill. If you are at a screen at noon, open any of katsu’s social media and refresh like your life depends on it. You see the passkey booking link before I do, you @ me and post it. 

Meanwhile I’ll be on the phone with Marriott as I do the same thing, depending on if I can get the phone staff to book it before the portal I go with either scenario. Also opening the booking on two computers to circumvent the “only one passkey tab per computer please” bullshit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The war begins
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:rise:557579163511554050>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *If Biru collects the 6 Infinity Passkeys, he'll be able to book half the rooms at Katsu with a snap of his fingers*
Bill: *fuck that* Katsu still overpriced and there’s a one night deposit.
Bill: Bonus idea, if any of you go to book but just sit on the idle screen, and I can’t lock two quick enough, you can release that room and I can try and grab it. ~~if have you book it in my name but I don’t wanna give you my credit card info~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what kind of room are we aiming for?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I honestly have no idea how booking works so if I tried I'd probably fuck it up lol
Bill: same as last year.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lower level with balcony?
Bill: yeah.
Bill: Once I have reservations, I have the number of the Guest Services manager I spoke to about the chaos this year, I spoke to him yesterday and he said he'll ensure our reservations are correct this year from the get go. 😏
Bill: If they want to charge for additional guests in the room this year I dunno if I'll have the clout to get out of it tho.
Bill: I'm not putting everyone on the reservation again, so it's a 'find out when we get there' problem.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so how many per room?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so this what we aiming for? can you select which floor?
Bill: it's going to be queen<>king again (gaylord has no atrium queen<>queen) so 10 max.
Bill: You don't book through marriott proper, you book through a PoS third party software.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): gotcha. I just wanted to see what their room options were
Bill: you don't even pick room type, just atrium or not.
Bill: it's quite simple in theory, you open the website, pick dates, put in your info, reserve. It's just not reliable with all the people attempting to book.
Bill: *and you can't use phone half the time anymore cause people book too fast*
Bill: Which I hate.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I won't be able to help with the refesh party, coworker is moving into my office and I gotta feel out weather or not he's cool with goofing off, so no long stints of discord anymore for awhile
Bill: turn desk to hide screen.
Andrew: 
Andrew: Eyy wig arrived
Aldus Larian (Jess): im not allowed
Aldus Larian (Jess): Neither would I be able to left this thing

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): can you sneakily install one of these on your work computer? xD
Bill: silver elite reservation line works. I miss the days where I could get away with booking an hour ahead of everyone else by calling.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wish, id probably get in trouble though
Andrew: 
Andrew: I just realized the madoka in the background XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): kurt koballmight

Andrew: i spent the morning doing general spring cleaning
Andrew: but my work comes later
Bill: Get those social media sits open weebs.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m stuck on a bus between campuses so it’s not lookin like I can hop in
Andrew: what am i looking for
Bill: katsu's social media will post a link to the booking portal.
Andrew: ill see what i can get then
Bill: stresssss
Bill: What a mood Step.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm trying to book just to see if I could
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have no idea what I'm doing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Everything say not available to book
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait now it updated
Bill: Got em.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HELLA
Bill: Phone guy is a hero.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/lol-vine-deez-nuts-CYU3D3bQnlLIk
Andrew: yatta
Bill: I couldn't even fill in an online reservation faster than he could copy the first reservation to the second.
Bill: booked by 12:03.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Justin called 12:05 and by then all atrium were closed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so what did you do? just because I'm curious about the process. you booked the room on the site, selected dates, and selected how many people? then you called the guy to copy the reservation to get two rooms?
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Executive suites sold out in seconds” lol
Bill: I called at 12:50, got a guy at 12:55. I explained what I wanted to do, he put in info and was filling out my information at 12:00 when they opened. He had that room booked by 12:02? At the same time I was filling out a second room form online just in case it was blocked by the time he finished putting in info for the second room; but he was able to copy paste the info on the reservation so he needed a fraction of the time to book the second room.
Andrew: He came on clutch
Bill: I could have had three pretty easily.
Bill: he *called* or had them check at 12:05.
Bill: Cause called means 10 minutes on hold, then they have to go through the system, then fill out info...
Bill: Also if you call, you have to tell them to look under passkey, not under the marriott reservations. Everything IS booked in marriott's reservations, the con bought everything and resells through passkey.
Bill: > Me, all morning: AnXiEtY
> Me, Booking: "Oh my god thank you that was so easy Socli" (weird name I know)
> Me, finally getting in a shower: This wasn't so bad
> Me, checking twitter after shower: *Remembers why I get anxiety*
Bill: Anyway.

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): fuk the con is 13th-16th
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): valentines day was so much easier with a weeb
Bill: It's always valentines day yes.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): nah its valentines or presidents day i feel like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its been presidents day before it thought
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow katsu was in march in 1996
Bill: It's not like you need a commercial holiday to appreciate having an SO anyway.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): katsu badges are 55 right now hrmm
Bill: Ugh no, I'm not figuring out the rooms and splits for Katsu right now.
Bill: I need to watch training videos so I have *something* for my timesheet.
Bill: Did anyone else figure out cosplays for tomorrow?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think earlier the chat was saying mostly normal clothes, leanna doing cap and erik doing casual goro? georgia doing star and tom maybe asriel?
Bill: That was the last updates I heard. Georgia and Justin have Starco, Leanna got Cap, Erik casual Kiri?? and no idea for Jess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess is being powerful
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol I have no idea
Bill: I was thinking about V earlier in the week but like.. eeeh....
Aldus Larian (Jess): im considering San? i dont even know is toms gonna cosplay
Bill: mm. Ye, I don't think I look good enough as V to want to solo V, Hazel too hot, Baarrrrry I guess, or just. Be normal.
Bill: idk.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): could always just wear your bnha hoodie
Bill: Only mirio wogs I got are oof tier bad, and I'm fine being normie over partially cosplaying.
Andrew: all in or nothing?
Bill: All for one.
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Andrew: you just made a rival my friend
Bill: but yeah. Actually even Casual Mirio at Zenkai felt silly to me.
Bill: I forgot about that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is a hoodie really a partial cosplay?
Andrew: im just waiting to do Norman for casual
Andrew: so i can say i have a "casual" costume
Bill: What am I, generic BNHA student gym outfit? Meh.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but its just like...nerd gear
Bill: Not cosplaying ain't the end of the world to me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like im not reccomending it as a cosplay, im just saying it would be good to be a normie ..in fandom attire
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Andrew: should i walk into work with the AM wig as is
N🆗ri (Marisa): how can u go to a con and not cosplay
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes andrew
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): do it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow between Katsu and Zenkai, I have so much fucking Mystic Messenger content xD
N🆗ri (Marisa): what color does the non-red/non-white part of this dress look like. the dark color
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i need more mystic mess content someone pls cosplay it with me if you want~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): looks like a dark grayish brown?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): reminded me of Megumin's colors
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which is a dark brownish
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it is the same ish hmmm
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wonder because they're both isekai companions
N🆗ri (Marisa): filo and aqua have similar palettes too
N🆗ri (Marisa): 95% of costumes i've seen online have it as a black, but eyedropping the color from various points in the show makes it a dark purple grey, but the only costume that has it in purple online looks bad. i think it's because the purple is too light though so if i get a darker purple-grey maybe?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, this one doesn't look right though it's the closest color i can see
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): some fanart makes it purple
Andrew: its def not black i dont think
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think it's gonna be tough matching the fabric tonight because jack's fabric selections are kind of fading
Andrew: i always saw bdark brown
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've seen dark brown, it looks good but still a bit off
Andrew: yera it does look off a bit
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel like getting the exact color from the eyedropper will look odd also because sometimes colors in 3d look different from how they look in the 2d counterpart because of the style or whatnot
but black and brown are ng so maybe the purplegrey could work? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): i pray mine looks 2% as good as that outfit tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think brown would look better than black
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): brown doesn't look *too* bad to me?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I would say the purplegrey would look better
Andrew: id like to see the purplegray irl
Bill: BNHA hoodie a pretty tight fit, but maybe.
Bill: only rooms not booked rn are Zenkai then, <@!301927856240459777> if you hear anything about them let me know.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oki they'll probably mention it at the wrap meeting
N🆗ri (Marisa): but they're having some serious communication issues
N🆗ri (Marisa): like did u know the head of registration quit 2 days before the con
N🆗ri (Marisa): because of what we went through this year they said i could transfer into whatever position i wanted in the con, but. we're considering if we want to staff again. there's not really anything else for us to do at the con except staff, but this year was rough.
they're also bringing politics of other cons into our con which shouldn't be happening. even if someone is head of such-and-such over at otakon, that ought to mean nothing to zenkaikon staff because this isn't otakon.
N🆗ri (Marisa): we have like 200 staff *at the absolute most* and yet gave away 500 free badges. where did those 300 go. we didn't have 300 panels.
i know one went to a woman who was complaining she couldn't go into the dealer's hall with her daughter because she didn't have a badge, and someone gave her one for free because they know her from animenext staff.
that shouldn't matter, this isn't animenext.
Bill: Marisa for con chair!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i want to die i'd just bring everyone down with me
N🆗ri (Marisa): i do an anger at people who can't follow the rules
Bill: ~~good plan lets goooo~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): lets get this window open so i can fall out of it
Andrew: this staff thing was really bad goddamn
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's usually not, this year was just a wreck
Andrew: in the back of mind i wanted to try staffing opne year
N🆗ri (Marisa): you should!!! do it!!!
Andrew: a couple of my friends gophered ota the last 2 years
Andrew: well itd prob be anext or zenkai
N🆗ri (Marisa): we're a bit sore because i've been staffing there ~8 years and volunteering for longer, bojo's been staffing for longer, and yet we're worked to the bone and still on the bottom rungs. bojo's a team captain and people still don't know who she is and refuse to listen to her. my transfer application was straight up lost for months and i lost all the positions i had before. that's not how you treat long-term staff, and if they're treating us like that how are they treating new staff members?
they yelled at her for three hours after the convention ended over one single complaint. one small complaint out of 6000 people she interacted with. they scolded me for doing things i had permission and got prior approval to do, or for not doing things that i requested to do which were turned down.

they have a hierarchy but they abuse their power and then don't follow that hierarchy because they listen to people that have more power at other conventions. they lie and shift the blame to people they think are expendable but are pillars of the convention.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm still angry :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): currently living in a state of constant depression and suicidal thoughts with interspersed anger at zenkaikon <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Yeah Zenkai really fucked up.
Bill: You need to just squad with us and have FUN all con.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don wan bother
N🆗ri (Marisa): prolonged exposure to the me is unhealthy
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I wonder if it's just one person that messed up or many
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AND N E V E R BOTHER
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YOU KNOW THIS
N🆗ri (Marisa): a few
there were good eggs
but the mess ups occurred with people in power. there are good people in power, but the bad eggs are overstepping their boundaries
Aldus Larian (Jess): Crack da eggs
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, for one you never ever yell at someone over one complaint
especially without hearing everyone's side of the story first, such as the person you're yelling at and any witnesses
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Submit complaints
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Many
Elfriede Faun (Tom): About management
N🆗ri (Marisa): submit complements, that's why i was sayin' to praise bojo in the feedback forms
we've had discussions with board members and sorted stuff out. they know they messed up.
that's why they offered me a position in any spot i wanted but like. that won't help u now, especially if things continue like this.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i would've had the spot i wanted if they didn't lose my application <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it was an online application. how do you lose something submitted online.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahhh....
Bill: Unrelated, apparently my lightstands are taking up a permanent residence in trunk so I'll have those if anyone has *ideas* tomorrow night.
Bill: I could go ham and bring the ~~basically still in the packaging~~ backdrops but not unless there's a real need.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah my backdrops are still in the package too
i should find space for those and try photoshoots with a camera timer
N🆗ri (Marisa): do gag backdrops exist
N🆗ri (Marisa): psychadelic backdrops. backdrops that look like the seats on a bus, the carpet in a bowling alley, or the plastic on a tiny cup
N🆗ri (Marisa): a backdrop that's just
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): amazon has this
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Perf
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!334090409389195266> needs the giraffe one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its just me though
N🆗ri (Marisa): now you can cosplay twin characters
N🆗ri (Marisa): rem and ram, the hitachiin twins, chii and freya, other anime twins that i can totally think of right now.
all u
N🆗ri (Marisa): with the power of backdrop
