Bill: Guy in b&h told me you should print photos your proud of... maybe I’ll blow a 13x19 for Pyrrha.
Bill: Just to see it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Barnes and Hoble
Bill: B&h photo.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bave and Husters
Bill: Dave and busters is something we all gotta go to again ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yes
Bill: Let’s gooooo
Bill: I need plans this weekend.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Me and kurto have dave and buster's wands from our excursion. I'd like to use mine again
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I need to not be stuck at home so
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): There was big news of one opening up down here by the outlet mall. I remember it was all over the news. Did it shut down already? It doesn’t exist anymore 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did it immediately go out of business
Bill: You must be thinking of the two in Wayne and Woodbridge.
Bill: They still open.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Naw it was at the premium outlets in Gloucester or thereabouts. Definitely closer than the one in Philly but their website says that’s the closest one to me
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh wait it doesn’t exist yet
I guess they haven’t built it yet? What was all that hype about then years ago
N🆗ri (Marisa): Coming April 2020
N🆗ri (Marisa): Haha 4/2020 you know what that means
N🆗ri (Marisa): Would people be interested in a cosplay skating event again
Jim keeps posting a lot of events at his rink I wonder if he’d let us back
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Bill: yes
Bill: that was supposed to be all caps.
Bill: YES.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I get very nervous thinking about it tho. It was expensive for attendees and there was a mixup with the skate pricing, which we made up for but I’m irrationally afraid Jim hates me now because of it. There was the mess with the event being private because of potential creeps but that severely limited its reach. People got there really early and couldn’t get in before it opened so maybe we could extend it to be a longer event if more people show up but hhhhh
Bill: We'll help you, it'll be fine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I would move it to another rink out of embarrassment but I don’t know of any others that might let us do it
N🆗ri (Marisa): For a reasonable price
N🆗ri (Marisa): But skating fun
N🆗ri (Marisa): Would definitely have to be later in the year if I can find a better job tho
Bill: Iiiii put the paper in the wrong way.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Art
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Didn't you do that the first time you used your printer as well?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THE GREAT ONE
Bill: Grimm Pyrrha.
Bill: Yup. With Ryan’s SSSN team.
Bill: Interestingly, the skin doesn’t smudge.
Bill: *censorship*
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Save me Jaune”
Bill: Qrow!pyrrha
Bill: 
Bill: Actual print is as fucking amazing to look at as I thought. God damn.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The Really Great One
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): woha
Bill: If was art print would buy in a heartbeat.
Bill: In reality don’t need a 13x19 picture of Georgia on my wall.
Bill: My sanity <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: So I’ll pawn it off on you Georgia when I see you.
Bill: You can really *see* the background blur at a full size print though.
Bill: I was going to print a different one but square crop and 13x19 aspect ratio.
Bill: Oh yeah photo doesn't do it justice at all, that's the whole point of printing it.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao omg that failed print
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Amazing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH AND YO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): FUCKING

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh no 5 dollars what ever will you do <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: As for prints I’mma actually use, finally printed bar selfie. ~~it’s April and I have four photos on this board that’s not good~~
Bill: also 🖕 Tom 😁
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s me! <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: YE
Bill: Erik has inagurated a boudoir tab on the site.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ghhhhhhghh *sam it’s too early for this*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Her rates also went up? Was $40 for 6 photos before. Rip won’t book her anymore probably
Bill: Not... really.
Bill: Depth of light was always expense I though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok then I gotta decide my animenext lineup today
N🆗ri (Marisa): I always shoot with her she had reasonable prices
Bill: No wait never mind I wrong.
Bill: about the being about time thing.
Bill: Zenkai being so early fucked me up man.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oH she’s the new admin of the group maybe that’s why she’s starting booking now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): David doin male Blake too!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YESSS
Bill: I saw that before I passed out.... more rwby good for him, thought about throwing wad of money at him...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So did people decide RWBY cosplays for Kogara?
Bill: Seems like it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): On homestuck day? Scandalous
Aldus Larian (Jess): They did?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Musta missed that lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): Leanna is doing Penny, Webecca is going sun, Anna I think is ironwood?
N🆗ri (Marisa): But Georgia was gonna do a non rwby cosplay right? Or did she change to rwby
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh Jaune?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess lets homestuck <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): We can be the twins
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just shave your hair
Bill: Georgia isn’t going to Kogara she has work.
Bill: She might come over later to sleep over.
Bill: Also I did a stupid.
Bill: I’m a better person half asleep.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pls say you made another wonderful demon print
Bill: No.
Aldus Larian (Jess): O no
Bill: Is David officially with echoblaze?
Bill: Or do I not know that still.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he is
Bill: But like, publicly?
Bill: No right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): uhhhh idk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tbh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They havent said anything publicly yet
Bill: ~~can I just said say I know cause Georgia cause ffs I wanna congratulation him~~
Bill: ~~fuck it~~
Bill: It’s not like I didn’t put two and two together when he vague posted about the wonderful person he was talking to night and day.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I mean i dont see why not
Bill: Already did. *he wants to say I’m his family away from home and best friend he can deal with me knowing shit*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Awwww
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's wholesome
Bill: He is disgustingly pure. The sugary sweetness he lets off actually reacts negatively with my salt mines and gives me a rash.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So with everyone doing RWBY, do I want to be the oddball and do Tai or do I want to begrudgingly coordinate with Rebecca and do Blake... 😑
Bill: I could pull a Hunter and be like “sorry I only shoot BEEEEESSSSSS”.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I might just do Blake because I liked doing the V2 outfit and idk when I'll wear it again
Bill: May as well be comfy. Kogara too small to be complicated.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Tai and Blake are about equivalent in terms of comfort lol
Bill: I mean... Blake doesn’t fit with Ironwood or Penny either. Not that much more connected.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah but Blake goes with Sun. Tai doesn't go with anyone
Bill: Since you could do Taiyang/Ironwood “thanks for this robo arm for my stupid daughter” that’s a thing.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀 -zooms in- yang is not stupid! <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
-zooms back out-
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ahhhhhhhhhh stop yall are givin me FOMO
Bill: Her right arm would beg to differ.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): technically i could find cover but its a bad ideaaaa
Bill: Try and get coverage at work?
Bill: Wellll there you go.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i would lose money tho
Bill: You have savings. You aren’t going to any cons (read money sinks) till summer when you’ll be working in *some* capacity making more money than a single Saturday will make you.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~also its freeeeeee~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~not costing you extra money~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Or stick to your guns, and we’ll see you the next day if not that evening.
Bill: That wouldn’t satisfy me so far as fomo but.
Bill: It’s technically true.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but i wanted to buy a spidergwen suitttttt ahhhh
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: Not going to convince you one way or the other.
Bill: Have to choose for yourself.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bayanga, supported by Aurii
Bill: 😏
Bill: 😐
Bill: 😦
Bill: I should probably be more fiscally conservative.
Bill: In other news, even my Facebook page is getting unusually high reach from Pyrrha crosspost. Or Erik / Tristan tagging the page with their profile pics.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk fam those pyrrha pics are pretty litty
Bill: Yes they are.
Bill: Yes, they are.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Tai post is doing well and honestly the promotion is only doing a little bit of the work so that means it's a genuinely good post
Bill: We’ve only got decisions for Kogara cosplays right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same
Bill: Lemme rephrase, nothing decided for cpac right.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cept Dave and Ashe nah
Bill: I high key want to do a mini shoot with Zeikani, and she’s booking Cpac. Only thing I’d be in is big three, but I don’t have a usable wog rn and you guys may want to do something different, otherwise I might just. Slip someone 25 bucks so I can watch her shoot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m still shook over that opera boss from Zenkaikon.  She was so good.
Bill: what?
N🆗ri (Marisa): The girl who cosplayed the opera boss robot
N🆗ri (Marisa): She could sing so well
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=b618NQzOpq8
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait oops that’s the whole thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): simone? from nier? 😮

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that was honestly amazing and i had chills in the audience
N🆗ri (Marisa): Favorite masquerade act
Just seeing it made the whole con so much better
Bill: ACTUALLY opera singing though damn.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah it's crazy yoo
Bill: I don't think I've ever been tagged in tumblr post Leanna. XD
Bill: I got a freaking *email*.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh WOw
Bill: Tumblr: "Yo bitch someone actually interacted with your posts*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Someone named @toxic_panda22 just unfollowed me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I checked them out and they had like 7K followers and one cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I was like “this is what Scott would want to be”
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how the hell
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): sounds like a toxic person you don't want to have following you anyway
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): some good stuff coming out of the toshimaen event this week
N🆗ri (Marisa): A bag got stuck to my foot and I checked it and it’s my homestuck armsocks that I haven’t seen in like five years so if that’s not a sign from the universe I don’t know what is
