Bill: Ordered das boots too.
Bill: Kirsten wants me to do v6 Neo and Kimono Neo! ~~I wonder if that one shot of Georgia‚Äôs uraraka I gave out early is why~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought you meant she wanted you to cosplay V6 Neo and Kimono Neo
Bill: Oh uh. No.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same yho
Nokri (Marisa): Is there a swim rwby group for colossalcon? :0 do you need any extra characters
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~I am also interested~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~I got sick and couldnt wear swim yang last year~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wanna wear my red lifeguard-esque bathing suit for Pyrrha
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So consider swim RWBY started if it wasn‚Äôt already üòÇ
Nokri (Marisa): O I saw in your story you had a group for swim rwby and got nosy
Bill: ~~and keep it to Aurii till closer to colossal...!~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean that‚Äôs not for group purposes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That‚Äôs just... making it RWBY day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The group will be whoever ends up at the meet up
Bill: I did realize you already had it to story.
Bill: No bikini Pyrrha this year?
Nokri (Marisa): Oooo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wut no I‚Äôm bringing bikini Pyrrha
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or rather one piece Pyrrha
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not full
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just had that picture to use when I threw it up on my story real quick to see what everyone else is wearin
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): bringing full Pyrrha to CCE, do you mean, the definition of ‚Äúnot worth it‚Äù
Bill: ~~I specifically referring to the bikini swimsuit versus one piece~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah I bought that one piece cause I‚Äôm like in love with it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Definitely wearing that one
Bill: I didn‚Äôt. Say full.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I looked all over for that one piece last year! Remember when I complained that I went to three targets and none had it!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and then I stumbled on it in March_
Bill: Mhmm. I remember.
Nokri (Marisa): do people go to the waterpark all 3 days? or is that mainly a one day thing at the con?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs basically all three days
Bill: The water park is the con.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cosplays are either to match the arcade, the pool, or the outside, and there isn‚Äôt much outside
Bill: And it‚Äôs been shitty weather every year we go.
Bill: For outdoors.
Nokri (Marisa): oo from what i've seen of pictures there's a lot of non-waterpark stuff too
maybe just in pictures
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wait.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What does it matter bikini Pyrrha vs one piece Pyrrha?
Bill: It doesn‚Äôt?
Nokri (Marisa): u askin a lot about it tho <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm not tryna recreate the mojojoj art if that‚Äôs what ya wondering
Bill: No no no, I asked once. There was much clarification made to the question.
Bill: I.... know. I‚Äôm curious cause you looked good last year.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O ya no those bottoms were too tight and the top was the matching part to another swimsuit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): One piece all da wae
Bill: Of note, you wandered the con in like, Jean shorts over your suit? That‚Äôd be good for a casual ‚Äúnot in the water‚Äù look.
Bill: It‚Äôs very Pyrrha.
Bill: Dunno if we‚Äôd do that shoot versus just in the water.
Bill: But if we did it‚Äôs an idea.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wear whatchu want gurl
Nokri (Marisa): i'm definitely wearing police swimsuit rin. no one allowed to drink.
Bill: ~~I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúwear the bikini‚Äù, that‚Äôs clear right?~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye this con the one piece can be like a tank top if I put some green jean shorts over it
Nokri (Marisa): and if there's a swimsuit rwby thing maybe swim ruby
Bill: Yup that‚Äôs the look. ~~green?~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): maybe they're ren's <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean I wouldn't say it was *clear*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye they were dark green last year
Bill: Wait okay. I vaguely recall. I wouldn‚Äôt call those jean shorts?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jean material
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are they denim?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): is it cuz green shorts rhymes iwth jean shorts?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then they Jean shorts <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: Doesn‚Äôt matter the look is sound.
Nokri (Marisa): man i didn't even need to restyle the wig, coulda just bought this

Nokri (Marisa): oh so iida, rin, and ruby that's 3 swim outfits. then i can plan at least 4 non-swim outfits.
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's so many outfits
Nokri (Marisa): it'll be cheaper to buy a swimsuit in august or early september when they all on sale

Bill: Bet Tom‚Äôll wanna do that again.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wait what is Tom gonna wanna do?
Bill: Swim mystic messenger now that you two have ~~infected~~ spread the game to others?
Nokri (Marisa): i have a wig i could do for kallen but not a swimsuit. she has a canon swimsuit probably.
ghoul! ghoul! ghoul!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh code Geass ya
Nokri (Marisa): i think my jaehee is too bad to be recognizable in a swimsuit and i can't do ray
Bill: You‚Äôre the best Jaehee.
Aldus Larian (Jess): They have school swimsuits in code Geass! 
There's a super cute galaxy bikini I'm prob gonna buy weather or no MM happens or not
Bill: ~~none of the mystic messengers are recognizable outside of their outfits~~
Nokri (Marisa): i have plenty of swimsuits, i'm looking for non-swimsuit cosplays now
there's lots to do outside of the waterpark right?
there's an arcade georgia said?
Bill: LOLOL
Bill: Fair warning, in the past we haven‚Äôt stayed in non swimsuit too long. Tho. Without the double late swim maybe?
Nokri (Marisa): oh yeah!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yes those
Bill: Ugh. I need to plan Animenext first.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~saeran, Yoosung, and seven are regogziable without Thier outfits~~
Bill: Yoosung?
Nokri (Marisa): the hair clips
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dat hair clip
Bill: I GUESS.
Aldus Larian (Jess): At least saeran and seven cuz tattoo/glasses
Nokri (Marisa): are there any requests for animenext
otherwise it's probably gonna be....... manaka, haruhi/yuki, ranma, raphtalia, yona?, kagura, and something i'll figure out later
Bill: V is recognizable. ~~but I can‚Äôt tell you how. We‚Äôll talk about it later~~
Nokri (Marisa): camera and sunglasses
Bill: You wanna come to the rwby shoot? Or fire emblem shoot?
Nokri (Marisa): wait doesn't jumin have a canon swimsuit
they all have canon swimsuits
Nokri (Marisa): jumin has 2 i think
Aldus Larian (Jess): Plus you bring in another aspect of the character with your swimsuit and Bam recognizable
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA
Nokri (Marisa): wait no you can't really see them in the cg hmmMm
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): seven just needs the shark thing
Nokri (Marisa): yoosung needs starfish on his chest
Nokri (Marisa): i don't have jaehee's abs i'm just bone
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zens just naked I guess
Bill: ~~it‚Äôs basically canon tho~~
Nokri (Marisa): wait no jumin's wearing the same outfit lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does this count as canon?
Nokri (Marisa): yes 1000%
Bill: Maybe do a fire emblem Mawisa, be good to pad the numbers at Andrews first shoot.
Nokri (Marisa): ooooo yeah. those are kind of elaborate though
Nokri (Marisa): i could do nowi, her outfit is basically a modified bikini
Bill: Oh I mean at Next.
Bill: But also fire emblem at CCE.
Nokri (Marisa): ooo next
i want to!!!! flora's doing flora!!!
Bill: I was browsing Ez and almost got Eliwood. There was no picture of it though so I figured it was sketch.
Nokri (Marisa): but i have to see what my entry time is if i do the contest
also corn is really hot. i had no issues outside at katsu
Nokri (Marisa): i also look awful in corn
Bill: Corn was good.
Bill: ~~I don‚Äôt know anything about fates but~~
Nokri (Marisa): and lucina
basically everyone except nowi which i'm also meh at
naw corn was horrifying
Bill: Spring Lucina was cute you can shut up girlfriend.
Nokri (Marisa): her tome is a guide book hehehe
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have no idea what I wanna do for next
Nokri (Marisa): spring lucina? more like belongs in the trash
Nokri (Marisa): jess you gotta decide what to do for next
no pressure
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uhhhhhhh
Bill: Well I was about to say it‚Äôs coming up so please think about it. If you‚Äôre more comfortable planning a shoot ahead of time, you need to plan the cosplay ahead of time.
Bill: That goes for Tom too, but he always says he doesn‚Äôt care.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom said he wanted to do unknown at next? At some point?
Aldus Larian (Jess): We only have 2 days
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò≠
Bill: I realize you guys decided cosplays day of the last few cons. ü§î
Nokri (Marisa): irl yoosung cry emoji moment
Bill: You will be sorely missed.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah that's only been day cons
Bill: ~~is it even a con without Tom and Jess~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): But we have been pushing line ups till basically last min cuz Tom hates planing a line up
Bill: And you want to pair with him, that‚Äôs a dilemma...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yup! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: I enjoyed early Zenkai where we wandered as a squad and did photos... I‚Äôm fine with an ambiguous block of time like that.
Bill: I just find I don‚Äôt like it when most of the group leaves to do something and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúguess I‚Äôll go shoot so and so.‚Äù
Bill: Was thinking about that earlier.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): [yoosung cry noise]
Bill: I don‚Äôt want to feel pulled away by photos.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow that sent delayed
Bill: Yes it did.
Bill: Unless my enjoyment at Zenkai makes you sad. :3c
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No it was to the last minute planning thing LOL my Anext im hoping to have V5 yang done that‚Äôs mah goal
Bill: I know you‚Äôre still a toss up for next but think about it a bit too Georgia. Not that I‚Äôll ever book up cause I‚Äôm lazy and shoot friends only, but. Better to know ahead.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I think Anext is okay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Even is nasa comes banging on my door two days before the project starts I think I can do it
Nokri (Marisa): biru u totally book up, look at katsu! ‚≠ê
Bill: Did I?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah that's why i hired a bunch of other photographers
Bill: Well, most of our extended group doesn‚Äôt do next. Ie BNE. So there‚Äôs less of my usual fans.
Bill: So it sound be fine lolol
Bill: But if you want to give me a rough idea Georgia it‚Äôd be helpful. Beyond v5 Yang. (Kirsten is doing v6 Neo Saturday evening, and while they haven‚Äôt met in show that‚Äôd be a potential duo)
Bill: I‚Äôm not going to bring up the duo tho.
Nokri (Marisa): do you have any interest in the ones i listed?
Bill: From my side.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): What they met in show
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): You could do a rematch shoot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That'd be cool
Bill: Just not in the new outfits yet.
Bill: Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking, The Rematch ‚Ñ¢
Bill: Marisa I have an interest in Haruhi and Raph.
Bill: Particularly.
Nokri (Marisa): i was just thinking i'll probably do haruhi because the pictures i have of her are 10 years old, or just the hair thing
Nokri (Marisa): and i have a ton of yuki pics
Bill: I‚Äôll could do Yona too.
Bill: Yona also a big group I‚Äôll make an exception for, when Aurii does it.
Bill: Cause it‚Äôs so special to Mawisa. ‚ù§
Nokri (Marisa): i'm gonna die for yona
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yang is prime, probably for Saturday? Or Friday? Whichever RWBY day is
Bill: Saturday.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Spidergwen was something I was hoping for
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And whatever the third thing is I probably should chill on and rewear or finish half started something‚Äôs
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I‚Äôve also been saying I‚Äôd do lux for ten years
Bill: That you have.
Nokri (Marisa): you gotta finish that soon because there isn't an 11 year emoji
Bill: Two new cosplay tho.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye exactly what I‚Äôm thinking and lux isn‚Äôt an easy one
Nokri (Marisa): u got a month üåü
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): PLUS I wanna make thor for Otakon SO
Bill: Yeah. Lux should get bumped again imo.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yona is still sitting half done...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah Lux is getting bumped, I wanted todo and Thor for Otakon and I gotta pace myself lol
Bill: Yes you do.
Nokri (Marisa): should i get a new yona wig? my old one was bought before "yona wigs" existed and i had to get as close as i could find, but now there are nice ones specifically for yona
Nokri (Marisa): the one i have is comfy but off color and kind of short
Nokri (Marisa): $12.50 on ebay that's not too bad
Andrew: A seller has shield ehro bootss for 30 on ebay but estimated time is around anext
Nokri (Marisa): should i post a comparison
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah i like yours
Andrew: Do i risk
Nokri (Marisa): sounds scary
were you able to find black boots anywhere else?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): If any of you ever wanna borrow my yang wig lmk cause she just sitting there taking up space and I'm not really using it lately xD ~~spent too much time on that thing for it to go unused until vol 7~~  orrr I might need to do some other variant of yang in the meantime xD
Andrew: Not yet
Bill: Captain marvel Yang.
Andrew: im still searching, i am goin g to outlets on monday
Bill: ~~Yorse Yang~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Well yea bill but my cap marvel wont arrive for  like.. at least a month
Bill: Uh....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yorse
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ... yes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Anyone have a horse mask? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Cowboy Yang would be meme worthy too.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Truuuueeee
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'd do that
Bill: Lasso all the Blake‚Äôs.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cosplay switcheroo owo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I offer Pyrrha to whoever wants to suffer LOL
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEE suffering!
Nokri (Marisa): ~~my wig is awful, i'm gonna save up for that new yona wig~~
i have a sombrero if that helps
Bill: *Sign me tf up.*
Bill: Imma Hazel I guess? Better than Pilot boi for heat. Maybe do Barry for RE and idk.
Bill: V if Tom and Jess do Mystic messups?
Bill: Lol and I keep forgetting Mirio will be a thing again at some point.
Andrew: weird my internet is down on browser but not for disc
Bill: Or skip it.
Andrew: dont skip mirio
Andrew: now that im all might
Nokri (Marisa): i found pictures from the shoot i did, i invited a ton of other yona characters and another yona who practically took over my private shoot because she's so cute üò≠
the wig i'm looking at is closer to hers so
Bill: Asides from Hazel, the cosplaying is based on whose doing what.
Nokri (Marisa): i could do tsuyu or ochako for next
but i already did ochako at next once
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh *that* yonaaaaa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Knew that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Pfft
Bill: I can‚Äôt do Mirio till that wig comes off back order, that‚Äôs all.
Nokri (Marisa): not nier yonah sowwy owo
Bill: Cause the two I have lying around are trash.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What wig is it mawisa? I got one from Arda and I forget the style
Nokri (Marisa): one i got from aliexpress, lemme see
Bill: You could borrow Georgia‚Äôs maybe?
Nokri (Marisa): arda wigs are really really big on me
Nokri (Marisa): oh i guess i didn't order it on aliexpress. i got my yoon wig there though.
Where did this yona wig come from. ebay or amazon i guess
Bill: It was birthed from your love of Yona.
Nokri (Marisa): i could do morgiana for anext since i lost all of my pictures for her in the move <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Nokri (Marisa): they don't seem worth it, very expensive yeah and they don't look the style? i think?
Andrew: Nah they don't
Andrew: most of what im finding is either took expensive or doesnt look right
Bill: If I get the wig to Leanna maybe I could do Jessica for Next. ü§î
Nokri (Marisa): OH there's a second page to my wig purchases duh

Nokri (Marisa): yeah!! gloves are hard at first but easy to make with the right pattern

Nokri (Marisa): they could attach to the belt, or to the pants
Andrew: im still figuring it out
Andrew: kinda brainstorming
Andrew: yea i was thinking the belts

Bill: Are we doing the ‚Äúformal‚Äù at next? 80s prom?
Nokri (Marisa): I am
Aldus Larian (Jess): no idea lol
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nexts was decent last year at least
Bill: Yeah. I was an edgelord but. I kinda like the 80s theme. I feel like Mirio would be very 80s.
Nokri (Marisa): Tintin comics stopped being published before the 80s though and the cartoon started in the 90s
Nokri (Marisa): I hope there are at least five Zoot suits
Nokri (Marisa): Biru wear a Zoot Suit
Nokri (Marisa): Today is maid day don‚Äôt forget to post maid pictures
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont have any üò≠
Nokri (Marisa): u WOT
Come here I‚Äôm sure we can get one of mine to work for pictures
Nokri (Marisa): Or see if amazon has same day delivery in your area
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao nah they dont XD
Nokri (Marisa): Write them a stern letter about how they‚Äôre ruining the integrity of maid day
Bill: What does formal 80s even look like.
Nokri (Marisa): Depends on how you interpret the theme <:pew:543202259085950996> 
Im doing an 80s anime, or you could do it as 80s fashion
Men‚Äôs fashion was... pretty similar to how it is now? But also a mix of modern and 60s fashion. Sometimes bigger jackets and looser pants around the waist but not *too* much. High waisted.
Aldus Larian (Jess): poofy sleeve if my moms actual 80s prom photos represent anything
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH SO MANY POOFY SLEEVES
Aldus Larian (Jess): and coat tails? idk my mom made my dad get a suit with coat tails thats all i know
Aldus Larian (Jess): or tuz, w.e
Nokri (Marisa): Fun ideas
Nokri (Marisa): Jess are they your parents
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao no
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is that shrunk Heidi
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@351471675843411978>
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG thats what i was htinking
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Labinnak is doing Ochako huh
Bill: 
Bill: I was literally about to comment on that.
Bill: I‚Äôm so glad you decided against the hero suit.
Bill: It‚Äôs just. Ugh.
Nokri (Marisa): Having the belt printed on the suit looks a little odd
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): *why the long crotch?*
Nokri (Marisa): Having everything printed on the suit looks odd
Bill: Yeah it‚Äôs.
Bill: Oof.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nice vagina suit
Bill: Ochako is cute, but her hero suit is just. A mistake at best, fetish fuel at worst.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hawt clit :/
Bill: Aaaaah
Nokri (Marisa): Is it just because of the crotch line? Other than that I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs problematic
Nokri (Marisa): The heels?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): those stupid ass boots really irk me for some unknown reason
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i almost didnt watch bnha because i saw her boots and got so angry lmao
Andrew: Someone mentioned zoot suits and that reminded me one of my cosplays i always wanted to do used one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That suit has a way more prominent crotch line whaaat
Bill: Bless fem todo.
Bill: Kirsten asked about rates, said no rates i shoot friends
Bill: Do I. Have a policy on that?
Nokri (Marisa): You might wanna make one
Andrew: <@!301927856240459777>
Andrew: for the gloves
Andrew: could i get vambraces separate so i can just add the fur to the underneath glove?
Nokri (Marisa): O hewwo
Yeah! You could probably use your Velcro to attach it
Andrew: https://www.amazon.com/Syktkmx-Gauntlet-Wristband-Medieval-Vambraces/dp/B07GYN5NBK/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=brown+leather+vambraces&qid=1557509241&s=apparel&sr=1-1
Andrew: something like that over top so the guantlet is 2 pieces, the glove then the vambrace over
Nokri (Marisa): Oo that expensive though. Do you still have foam? Could make foam vambraces
Andrew: im out of foam
Nokri (Marisa): I spent 10 minutes trying to debug this machine because it wouldn‚Äôt sew
I figured it out, I forgot to turn it on. 
When I finally got it on I made sure to give myself a decent amount of seam allowance since I always forget.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): UHHH, i dont think thats enough
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you might run into some troubles
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah I might‚Äôve hecked up but that‚Äôs a risk I‚Äôll have to take. Next time I‚Äôll just use the entire ruler to add seam allowance? Will that work do you think?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mmmm it'll be a bit tight, but i think you'll be much better off than that tiny seam allowance you have there
Nokri (Marisa): Ok <:thinku:543194478614413318> I should invest in a whole bolt of fabric in the future to make sure there‚Äôs just enough
Nokri (Marisa): Thank for help o wise one senpai <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 2 would be safer, but yes, of course! always here to give you only the best advice
Nokri (Marisa): 2! Ok wow, I‚Äôm glad you said that. I‚Äôll tattoo it to my arm so I don‚Äôt forget
Andrew: boots and wig ordered
Andrew: i should say boot covers*
