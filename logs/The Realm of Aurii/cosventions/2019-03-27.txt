N🆗ri (Marisa): there was one person who had to be asked to change, idk what gender they were
it looked and sounded like a girl but she was rather flat-chested, and they were cosplaying kirishima thus they didn't have a shirt on. they were in a group of bnha cosplayers who were all girls. when they were approached the staff asked them to change and they said "you're making me very uncomfortable right now" and staff had to be like "you're making us uncomfortable tho?"
it might've been a trans guy pre-top surgery? idk

N🆗ri (Marisa): who started "i'm going through an elevator in a tunnel" was that canon mystic messenger or was that us or something else
Aldus Larian (Jess): It like a boat with a hole it is and you just keep scooping the water out with a paper cup and screaming "it's fine I'll fix it"

N🆗ri (Marisa): any character interrupting another is gold
Aldus Larian (Jess): YA THAT CALL IS SO GOOD
Bill: Prelim impressions:
* Piccolo teen titans came out better than Starfire and Raven regular. Terra looks great.
* Taiyang wins the light wall competition.
* Yang got the most benefit out of all the different shoots on the wall, cause I tried enough techniques to find what made Yang so gorgeous it upsetting
* There's a lot of learn in boudoir but we had a good, and appropriately memey start. Can't wait for more.
* ~~I definitely didn't give a shit about photos for Tristan by the time I got them, should have told him nah~~
* Should have used the zoom lens more than the prime 50mm.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok but how's my tummy look in those boudoir photos
Bill: good? There's not alot OF your Tummy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo!
Bill: You'll see when I get to it but like... it's not like boudoir we see, either when you google couples boudoir or comparing to like patreon sets.
Bill: That's not a bad thing either.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't find the hacked phone calllllllllllllllllllllllll
nooooo starfire and raven looked gr9
Bill: Of course they did. I’m talking about the photos.
N🆗ri (Marisa): have a talk with your camera
Bill: Are you suggesting my camera has an issue? That’s my *baby*
N🆗ri (Marisa): no no u just need to have a chat
N🆗ri (Marisa): a wee convo
N🆗ri (Marisa): a chit
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~biru's camera calls him daddy~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): my zenkai photos look great
Bill: You better be backing up your photos.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how much do i owe u
N🆗ri (Marisa): i haven't unpacked yet but i shall tomorrow. my stuff is next to the couch and bojo is asleep on it i think
Bill: Confirmation screenshots of a backed up photo drive, cosplaying Ray in our mystic messenger group.

Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think just the Marisa one made it to the end

Elfriede Faun (Tom): It was the two I made a big stink about getting your hands lined up on the mirror
Bill:

Bill: I think I sent them individually when I went through the set way back when.
Bill: It's pain to reupload to the flickr so download these.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Good stuff
Bill: oh fyi, if I'm dumping unsigned previews in channel probably best not to share dem to insta cause they're raw and such.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Too much raw power. Too strong.
Aldus Larian (Jess): so like do u want them back whenever we're done editing so they can be watermarked?
Bill: Water mark is on those two mirror shots.
Bill: *You can't tell in Tom's but*
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~wait, what does unsigned mean~~
Bill: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/502526204402860032/560303491747414027/U_-190324_Zenkai_0264.jpg No watermark in the corner.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Are you editing or you want me? I’m browsing memes
Aldus Larian (Jess): o i thought u were referring to the ones you posted earlier thats why i got confused
N🆗ri (Marisa): OoooooOoooOooooooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): i tried to edit but it sucked so i gave up XD
Bill: Nah, like Erik's gif is with a photo I'm going to develop later so that's a little weird.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but that photo is fine! and technically its nor your photo it was just on your camera so it wouldnt really get a water mark anyway right?
Bill: ~~that's basically the only thing I was talking about~~
Bill: Yeaaaaah I just wanted to say it for future reference, photo was shot by the George.
Aldus Larian (Jess): so what do you not want us doing?
N🆗ri (Marisa): reckless backflips possibly
Bill: Photos I post raw here but am editing later (so like, not the meme shit)  I'd prefer not posted as like, the final work. Cause the developed one will look better, for my "brand (lol)" and generally for peeps in photo.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but in the event that its not your photo then its fine?
Bill: Kinda grey area. Cause I'm pretty sure I'm still doing the develops on those?
Bill: So they going to look better later.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wanted to do my own for raynas if that ok
Bill: Yeah, I assumed.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but on georgias for us im assuming your doing them?
Bill: yeah, same assumption. Meant to check yesterday.
Bill: When I open that laptop I'll zip up your photos.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea no prob
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEAH THOSE!
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> Do you want to edit the MM stuff? Otherwise I'll do it with my galleries.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah you can take it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm sorry but I can't stop laughing at that picture of me with the honey butter chips xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): its pretty great
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t know what your expression is saying but it’s saying something
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): give em the ol' razzle dazzle
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Y E A H
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Luciel, I'm sorry I doubted you. These chips are pretty great and warmed my cold heart."*
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmfao
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): All canon
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin is a treasure
N🆗ri (Marisa): don't look too closely at the details <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait shoot i forgot a thing on the second image
Bill: WOAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): dani got 100 likes <:woah:543194447345876998>
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg that looks so much better than mine
N🆗ri (Marisa): noooooo urs is probably great
Aldus Larian (Jess): def not
Aldus Larian (Jess): yours is perf 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): i edited my wig to match tom's 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): also i erased his fingerprints on his fingers oops
Aldus Larian (Jess): matchy bois
N🆗ri (Marisa): no one can dox him now
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao good security
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is so cool
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, sorry if I shouldn't have posted the thing I posted
Bill: It good.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just thought the gif emoji things were cool. But the photo quality definitely dropped like 3 times when making it into a gif, then turning it into a video, then uploading to Insta >.<
Bill: part of the reason I don't actually mind there, cause it about da gif not the photo.
Bill: and it an awesome gif.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ITS SO CUTE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm upset they didn't have cleaner versions of V's
Bill: ~~no one loves him~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jumin's and 7's had a plain gray background which was easy to remove but V's had the background of the in-game chat background
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats ironic cuz in game vs and rays are higher quality than everone elses
N🆗ri (Marisa): they have clear versions of it tho? :0

Elfriede Faun (Tom): AHH GOOD EDIT WOOO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > reading through characters on the wiki
> damn, there are so many characters with the last name "Choi"
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA so confusing
Aldus Larian (Jess): there are alot of Kims too
Aldus Larian (Jess): like yoosung and V are both kim and they arnt even related
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and Driver Kim!
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA! i wonder what rikas last name is
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That todoroki dude found me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yup, that's him
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||rika's last name isn't revealed, possibly kim? but her real name is mina/serena (like saeyoung/luciel)||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||why does everyone in this game have 6 names||
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||wiki says she's Yoosung's cousin through adoption, so depending which of their parents are related it could be Kim||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||i think its through his mom||
Aldus Larian (Jess): why are we talking in spoiler tags XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||BECAUSE SPOILS <:lenny:395307171539189760>
like this little demon. this isn't rika.||
Aldus Larian (Jess): you know she had to do it to em
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like how under C&R here everyone looks so refined and then there's driver kim
https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/Characters
N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw no ray on that page <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Bill: Some of these descriptions are hilariously biased.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Who's Ray 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): ray gets put under Unknown on the wiki
N🆗ri (Marisa): how they biased? :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): best girl
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it the "maid" in quotations is that what makes it biased
Aldus Larian (Jess): the cursed 3
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG echo girls last name is choi too
N🆗ri (Marisa): coincidence???? long lost sister.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah that's what I was referring to! all three are Choi
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): plus 707 and Ray and their parents
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but apparently Choi is just a very common last name
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea choi is super common
N🆗ri (Marisa): like tanaka in japanese
Aldus Larian (Jess): smith
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or Smith in English
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk how it works in korea but i assume it's similar to how there's only like ~200 possible last names in japanese, and in vietnamese many people get their last name from the last dynasty which is why there are so many nguyens
Aldus Larian (Jess): OO yea maybe
Aldus Larian (Jess): i love how in game they are like "the prime minister is very attractive!" and im like 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): don't u see it
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean he looks better than V anf Jumins dads but like
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then jaehee is like "actually he looks like you seven" and seven like <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): seven goes and asks vanderwood to shoot him again and not miss
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~how can the character tell that the prime minister looks like seven but they cant tell that unknown looks like seven~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): like yoosung and zen see him and they are just like "Yup that dude, never seen anyone like him before"
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe saeran was so malnourished and gaunt-looking he looked too different
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||does Ray have a foot fetish???||
N🆗ri (Marisa): he hates himself and that's a demeaning type of behavior despite wanting to show affection. like, he's not worthy to do anything but lick her shoes or kiss her foot (the dirtiest part of a person).
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats liek the ending where you convince ray to worship u or some shit right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw, it's if you repeatedly put him down and demean him. rika approaches you saying someone needs to watch over him and puts you in charge and ray basically becomes your slave
N🆗ri (Marisa): tho yeah he does worship her, mc doesn't have any feelings for him in that ending
Bill: That’s the problem with your bumble Erik. You’re too competent, girls love a damaged guy.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Fucking rip
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Only in stories fam
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~ray's best boy because he's so relatable <:lenny:395307171539189760>~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): fetishes? no fetishes here
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): NOOOO 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): second picture in that collage shows they're twins
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): MY COWORKER ALMOST SAW THE FETISH COLLAGE
N🆗ri (Marisa): why his hand so big it's literally bigger than her back
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): SAEYOUNG
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Why it say his name
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz its the vday DLC!
N🆗ri (Marisa): he asks mc to call him that
Aldus Larian (Jess): he tells you to call him by is real name at the end of his route
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Unlike his brother whos like "call me whatever u want just done leave me plz bb~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): seven has yaoi hands
Bill: All this. Mah point.
Bill: Lol my business card is still on the bulletin board in the car wash.
Bill: That was like a year ago.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh they replaced the vday cg!
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!!! they updated them some time ago
did they make his hand smaler?
Aldus Larian (Jess): im moving to animemes <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Andrew: I think I'm finally caught up with sleep
Andrew: From the last week
N🆗ri (Marisa): what did you think of that cliffhanger
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Time to stare at this again for a few more hours
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO PLZ now im trying not to laugh at work
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): why would you laugh at such a serious work of art
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg bojo brought up a really good point
Jim was saying they wanted me to help interpret for japanese guests at this year's convention and for the next year draft contracts.
I have no problem with interpreting but I don't know the social nuances of business/legal japanese to draft a legally binding contract. why don't they hire an actual professional company for something that important instead of relying on volunteers
Bill: yeah don't staff
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea they should def be paying someone to write contracts
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd be interested in staffing if they had a japanese guest i really like 👀
but like. minor non-legally binding stuff. maaaaybe a Q&A at most but depending on what weirdly extravagant questions the fans ask and how elaborate the guest answers i may not be able to handle that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): rose was an interpreter for animenext and she wasn't able to pass n3 so maybe i can do it <:thinku:543194478614413318> but then again rose was banned from ever staffing there again
Aldus Larian (Jess): you could def do it!
Aldus Larian (Jess): not that i speak Japanese but you seem pretty.... capable?
Aldus Larian (Jess): like you seem pretty confident in your Japanese!
Aldus Larian (Jess): and i mean u survived a whole year in the country by yourself
Bill: ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): literally teaching people english
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill miss you lots if you decide to staff but i think youd be a great interpreter!
N🆗ri (Marisa): the longer i speak the less capable i become <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
some people definitely thought i was half japanese when i first met them. some people in japan would ask me that, and say i seem very japanese-y. my job offered japanese lessons for reduced rates so i tried a trial once and the girl told me that the more i speak the more i slip so i have to keep practicing (though that could've also been a hook to get me to pay for more lessons). I can do basic conversations and I can follow conversations but speaking about complex things is beyond me, I tend to overly rely on a stock number of words/phrases when getting around and sometimes let English cloud my mind (making me use the wrong verbs)
N🆗ri (Marisa): tokyo is incredibly english friendly though and my job was entirely in english, they discouraged us from using japanese <:minathink:544567715931750405> 
only times i was 100% thrown into japanese was like... shopping, using services (banking/post office), travelling, anime cons, and the super rare party with mikiyo's gang
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats ok though! they arent even paying you so they can be dissatisfied if you mess up something a lil bit
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): and i assume it would be mostly logistics anyway?
N🆗ri (Marisa): but that's the issue with zenkaikon, bojo is getting a lot of grief for things that weren't even her fault and they're putting a ton of blame/pressure on her despite her being a volunteer who worked for free
Aldus Larian (Jess): tell her to tell them "pay me and then u can complain"
Andrew: That's not right
N🆗ri (Marisa): interpreting at an anime con would basically be following the guest around at all times and saying  "you have to be in this location at this time", "are you hungry/thirsty/need anything?", "this person wants to tell you _____"
Aldus Larian (Jess): will they have u translating for panels?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ppppppossibly <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): 50/50
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can always tell who the guest's handler/interpreter (they're supposed to be the same person) is because they have a staff badge but they're dressed in very nice clothing. handlers wear suits and very professional outfits.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa really?
Aldus Larian (Jess): at otakon chertiz's interpreter was just a girl in casual clothes and she had to translate for 4 people
Aldus Larian (Jess): well 3
N🆗ri (Marisa): i dunno how strapped for translators they are. from what chet and jim were saying they're super desperate, but maybe they'll have one person assigned to panel/Q&A translation and they just need people to handle the guests personally
N🆗ri (Marisa): really? :0 maybe Cheritz brought their own
Aldus Larian (Jess): she didnt have an accent or anything but yea she might have been from them
Aldus Larian (Jess): 1 of them spoke like no english at all but the rest knew at least some 
she was really good though!
u be good too
Aldus Larian (Jess): but yea i think you could def do it! and if they give you shit then just tell them to fuck off and come stay in our room!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wish there was some way i could do it temporarily, like a gofer and just do an hour or two and get a free shirt
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo do u think maybe u could?
Bill: probably not. If they're so desperate for people they'll rope her into everything.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): theoretically if i'm not officially staffing for the con (they aren't giving me a badge, a room, or any compensation) i'm not bound to do anything. it'd make me a jerk but i could walk away at any time.
Bill: That'd burn bridges in the staff community though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh the zenkaikon staff community is currently like mint eye at the end of v's route
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The male translator was wearing nice.clothes tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The one who told me that 7's voice actor complimented my Ren
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA they had 2! right
Aldus Larian (Jess): im dumb
N🆗ri (Marisa): nO U NOT
N🆗ri (Marisa): im fite u
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH he was helping set up the panel and he was like "im sorry im not anyone exciting i just work in the office"
Aldus Larian (Jess): and he was like super nervous and i think half the crowd fell in love with him
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's like how yarny became so popular

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): are you asking how?
Andrew: yea, someone tagge dme in pics form FE shoot and i want to share it
Andrew: i could do story i guess?
Andrew: the arrow sends to story
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye you can save it and then post it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If you download another app you can share actual posts to your profile but you should probably just ask the original poster for permission
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): or you have the arrow to post to story
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THAT TOO
Andrew: Ill just do story for now
Andrew: Ill pm her then
Andrew:
