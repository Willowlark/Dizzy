Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@301927856240459777> I think, hypothetically speaking, 2.5" would be a good size. You know, hypothetically. And if they were hypothetically black with hypothetical people on front, that would hypothetically be neat. If you were to hypothetically make them, how much can I hypothetically pay you for your hypothetical services because I would hypothetically want to support your crafting skills monetarily. Hypothetically.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): On an un-hypothetical note, CCE Kiri is good to go
Nokri (Marisa): Hypothetically, I only have purple fabric paint and hypothetical purple fabric that isn't furry. so the purple part wouldn't be fuzzy, it's be flat like the inside of a cat's ear unless you don't hypothetically mind me hypothetically experimenting with paint and black fabric. this would be hypothetically free because it's all hypothetical <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hypothetically wouldn't mind it being flat on the inside.
Nokri (Marisa): Then weâ€™re hypothetically in business <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
