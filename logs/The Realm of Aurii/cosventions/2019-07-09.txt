Bill: So **I** die.
Nokri (Marisa): No me
Nokri (Marisa): We live in a society

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): nah its marisa surrounded by us all
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like a renaissance painting
El🆓de Faun (Tom): AHHHHH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I must see, I'll have to figure out how to view them tomorrow

Bill: I sent the spider gwen shoot to that girl I did a shoot with at Nezumi totally randomly? I got left on read! 👌
Bill: *Those are good pictures damnit a thank you would be nice*
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe she didn’t have time to look at them yet? Unless it’s been days
Bill: Last night but.
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Nokri (Marisa): She sleep and then she go to work/school maybe
Bill: <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Bill: We'll see.
Bill: I have no obligation to ever see her again tho so like? No loss. It gets annoying though. That girl I met at Rowan a few times in grad school I met at that mini con? Added her, she messaged me it was nice meeting, I messaged back a bit about how we should shoot the shit about Rowan being Rowan sometime, she said cool, then when I mentioned a place in the area (lives over by Newark) she goes fucking silent. 

I hate people.
Nokri (Marisa): People are a lot more hesitant about meeting up in person nowadays.
Bill: *we had just met two days before that*
Nokri (Marisa): And how long did you talk?
Bill: We spent 2~3 hours walking around with her other friend, I did a shoot for her and her friend, her friend seemed comfortable enough with me around to pull out his weed to smoke and offer me some.
Nokri (Marisa): That’s illegal. Very illegal don’t hang out with them
Bill: Anyway I don't need justifications.
Bill: It's just annoying.
Nokri (Marisa): But that was at a con right? It’s a social event and that was your first meeting, in a group hangout at an explicitly social event. Hanging out with one person you don’t know at a non-specified event can be dangerous and women don’t usually do it.
Bill: I didn't say anything about actually getting together...
Nokri (Marisa): You asked to hang out though?
Nokri (Marisa): I’m not talking about anything romantically, women just don’t feel safe going out as often
Bill: I said we should vent about being Rowan grads sometime, that's all. 

I don't want a fix here okay? It's annoying when a normal conversation just gets dropped, or I don't get even a thank you for photos. QED. It sucks, whatever. I don't need to fix it.
Nokri (Marisa): Ok, sorry. We’re just trying to make you feel better since you’ve been very negative about a lot of things. You said you wanted to talk about Rowan with her and suggested a local place, that sounds like an invitation to hang out. We’re not mind readers. We’re not trashing you or trying to get on your nerves. When anybody here complains about something, we talk about it. That’s the point of venting. So when you post, we assume you wanna talk about it and feel better about it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa more offered a possible explanation why things didnt go your way than a "fix"
Bill: I know you mean well, it's just like. I don't want explanations for the problem, have to justify why I'm bothered, or get advice. I can figure it out, and if I want opinions I'll ask for them. I just wanna say "that sucks" and know that yes, it in fact sucks. 

There's always a good explanation for something, most of the time there's something you can do to make it better, and sometimes there's a reason their actions are justified and I shouldn't be bothered. But in this moment? Fuck em.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but that sounds like you just want to wallow in your own negativity
Bill: If I have to keep justifying why I feel so and so way to answer your points and explanations, I feel worse for having the negative feeling in the first until I'm beating myself up for being bothered or I feel misunderstood entirely.
Aldus Larian (Jess): which i get wanting that cuz sometimes i just wanna vent too, but you havent talked about mch that isnt negative lately
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I mean in a normal situation it would just be a "damn that sucks" and you are valid for feeling that way
El🆓de Faun (Tom): When someone is talking about negative experiences all the time they're gonna get some advice to help them
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Or explanation on why it's happening
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Because although we care and feel your valid we want you to feel better as a person for the future
Bill: Cept all the justifying makes me feel worse. I need the smaller blow offs about the stupid stuff. If I have to explain myself *every time* I have a negative expression, feels like I need to explain myself for not being happy else I be judged for it. Like if I don't have a good enough reason for being annoyed I'm a bad person.
Bill: Not what you're trying to do, but it's the way it gets.
Nokri (Marisa): You say you feel like you’re talking to a wall when you post things, but you don’t like us responding to the things you post so it’s kind of a catch-22
Bill: I don't like needing to explain myself. There's a difference between 

"That girl didn't thank me for photos"
"oof, rough. Not very nice of her"

and 

"That girl didn't thank me for photos"
"She probably was too busy to open the message, even if it's shown as seen."

because the latter makes me think "oh I'm guess I'm the dick for being upset by it".
Bill: I gotta go drive home in a few, I'm already late leaving.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Well we also don't wanna be biased and talk about a girl who.might not have done anything wrong ya know?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Or at least I dont
Bill: It's one example. I'm not faulting her for life her either, *I know* there are plenty of good reasons she didn't reply. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt when it comes to it. But the action, right now? Sucks.
Bill: There's always an explanation, often a good reason, and sometimes a way to go about making the situation better. But my feelings about the situation are mine, and while I'll always listen to the explanation and give benefit of the doubt the feelings are still valid in the moment. Having to explain myself for having them is stressful.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's really depends, if your talking about work sucking or house hunting then it'll be a damn that sucks
By if your talking about someone else we know or even don't know that we don't have a bad opinion of, it's harder to just say damn
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And you don't gotta explain yourself
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If you don't want to
Bill: If I don't explain myself, I'm ignoring your advice/help and 'running away'.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You feel like you have to defend yourself for getting upset?
Bill: Sometimes ye. Too much advice makes me feel like that.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Cuz you don't,
El🆓de Faun (Tom): This could have went like: 
damn she left me on read
Us: maybe she didn't
You: yeah that's very true but it still feels bad
Us: understandable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We not tryna invalidate your feelings
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like if you’re like “she didn’t answer me because I suck” then we wanna help you consider that you don’t suck
Bill: Sure, that's a different scenario though.
Bill: Like, the advice is often good, and half the time of I've thought the same thing, so when you point it out it's like. "I mean, yes, I know I should be assuming she's too busy if I was a perfect human being but I am not so I still am salty".
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk it’s a to each their own thing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause sometimes Im like “if my friends don’t answer me does that mean they hate me” and I get sad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And then it’s like oh yeah they work 9 to 5 u dumb college student
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I stop being sad
Nokri (Marisa): I’m still convinced y’all hate me
Bill: We don't.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We love you mawisa!
Nokri (Marisa): No u
Bill: Yeah, I do that too. I vent about it because despite reason it still feels crappy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And u!
Andrew: You know how many times i miss the mark on here?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And also with you
Nokri (Marisa): Amen
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~and with your spirit!?~~
Bill: anyway on "to each their own thing" I'mma go drive home now. There's my thing.
Nokri (Marisa): They can’t just change Christianity
Nokri (Marisa): Vroom vroom
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ..... devils advocate. no one owes you anything whether that be a response to a message or their time or anything else. 

Yes it definitely sucks she didnt respond, I'd be a little upset by her not saying thank you too. But, idk. Theres more to life than obsessing over who pays you back via interaction/attention. 

You have been extremely negative lately in discord and it's often due to a "failed" interaction. Or you thinking that situations *should*  have gone another way or that you werent given the attention you think you deserve for doing some sort of service for someone (example: a free shoot at a con and thinking they owe you friendship/ chatting) 

I just wanna say I'm worried about you. 

Since I joined the server the negativity has been progressively getting worse and while this is a safe space for you and all of us its extremely worrying to see you get so worked up over these things as often as it is now. 

I know you dont want advice, but I just wanna reiterate that I personally would really love to see you try therapy with a licensed professional. I think it will greatly benefit you. 
Especially since we arent equipt to fully support you in these times of need. 

Especially if you think we are misconstruing things you're saying and making you even more stressed out. That's truly not the goal here. 

I cant speak for everyone,but I'm pretty sure we all want the same thing for you. For you to be a happy well balanced man,  and I think you need help from someone professional to help you learn coping skills to better deal with this social stress and anxiety you've been feeling lately. 

The best we all can do here is say that we understand your struggles and offer advice or explanations. But, that's jot always what you want or need. So, it might be better to have someone who can truly help you and knows what you need to hear/ do.
Aldus Larian (Jess): That pretty much sums it all up.
Nokri (Marisa): amen
Bill: I realized walking to the car having to explain that I have to explain myself so much is another example. Maybe a better one, cause it's not about someone. Cause now I'm like "Since everyone had counter points/didn't understand where I was coming from/had to discuss I guess I'm wrong and should feel bad." 

I know that's not the intention, and I'll shake it. just. uh. trying to explain.
Bill: And... apparently prove Leanna's point as she wrote it.
Bill: Alright.
Bill: Now I go.
Bill: Sorry I'm a mess, those are good points. (I don't think I'm owed friendship for a free shoot though, promise. Just a thank you for the photos themselves. The other case was because they were receptive to getting together sometime and then disappeared)
Kaio Vermino (Lee): No need to apologize. I just wanna make sure you're taking care of yourself.

 You've been getting a lot worse with the negative energy lately and I'm just really concerned and I wanna make sure you know we care.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I agree with Leanna. I've also been seeing more negativity coming from you lately, usually regarding trying to find a girlfriend. My two cents is that yeah, being lonely sucks, but there's more to life than finding a girlfriend.

I've found that actively seeking out a girlfriend usually never works out. A lot of times it just comes out of nowhere. Like yes, you need to be more social yui meet people, but having the mindset of "if I become more social, then I will get a girlfriend" isn't a good way to approach it. 

Dating apps can be useful and *do* sometimes work (case in point, my sister met her husband on Tinder). But don't get discouraged when you don't get matches. I'm usually on those apps out of boredom when I'm taking a shit. I don't really try to rely on them nor expect anything to come of it. 

I made friends out of all of you after my last relationship and I've really enjoyed just having you all as friends rather than worrying about getting back out there. You'll probably stress yourself out more trying to actively search for someone to date. Don't sweat it. You're still young and have a long time ahead of you to find love one day. Until then, we all love and support you and just want what's best for you. Thats basically the definition of love 💕
