Bill: I got ezcosplay to send me just the pants with the proper sizing for 20 bucks. Not sure what shipping is yet, or if it'll make it by Ota, but. It's not like I have a lineup anyway.
Nokri (Marisa): There’s a 50-person 30-minute meet and greet with the furuba seiyu at otakon, but to qualify for it you have to preorder the $65 limited edition box set
Is it really worth it, and could I cancel the pre-order if I don’t get in the meet and greet <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): That’s less than a minute of interaction with everyone <:thinku:543194478614413318> 36 seconds per person

Bill: Someone force me to plan *something* for Ota later cause I either need to decide to shoot, or decide to spend a cosplaying, and schedule shoots, and ugh. My lack of a plan is stressful.

Nokri (Marisa): Oh cool, I was trying to find a zipper foot to make life a little easier and found a giant zig zag foot bigger than my fist, for really old machines that can only sew straight lines
Nokri (Marisa): The box said zig zag attachment but we usually put like 10 feet in a box. This one took up the whole box.
Aldus Larian (Jess): wish i could sew a straight line
