N🆗ri (Marisa): My resin is here. The pigment is so tiny aaaaaaaa. I gotta find a flat spot they can sit for 24 hours where Sylvia won’t reach them. Hm.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The bottles were sitting outside in the cold. Will that mess with the contents? Inside the house is also freezing though so yolo
Dirty Lego (Tom): Prob warmer inside
Dirty Lego (Tom): But prob fine
Dirty Lego (Tom): Just gotta let that shit defrost
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m sitting on the bottles like a chicken on an egg. I hope they grow up big and strong.

N🆗ri (Marisa): They’re assigning the security teams now oooof
Dirty Lego (Tom): I was wondering why I kept getting a slow influx.of followers recently

N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooo right!!! cute!!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just washed my hands with dawn AND ajax thank u jess. it did nothing but my hands smell really really nice.
N🆗ri (Marisa): good new tho I read the back of the bottles and it says Certified Non-Toxic. it says it'll irritate my skin but i won't die too horribly. i'll probably be a little sticky for 24 hours and then my skin will be tough enough to fight in a wrestling match where i'll earn enough money to cover the medical bills for the injuries i obtained trying to wrestle.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Don't die
N🆗ri (Marisa): i made Too Much Resin
N🆗ri (Marisa): it looks pretty but there was SO MUCH i didn't have enough containers to fit it all in and by the time i was scrambling around to find more silicon containers it was already solidifying
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): those all got filled in lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): *i hope it solidifies properly and doesn't cause anything to catch on fire*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Those are nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): katsucon more like bling bling con
N🆗ri (Marisa): im excited to see the hero group
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Where did u get the molds?
N🆗ri (Marisa): [timmy turner voice] uhhh internet
N🆗ri (Marisa): i bought most off of ali for dirt cheap (less than $1 each), but BoJo accidentally misplaced them and we couldn't find them and time is running out so I quickly bought more from amazon. cost more but got here quickly.
since i only have one mold per shape now instead of the 4, it's gonna take at least 5 days to finish the gems assuming i don't mess up <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): each day i mess up adds another day it'll take to finish so I wanted to start them now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oo no you need four of each? 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye! at least for the earrings. it won't hurt to have extras of the other stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
