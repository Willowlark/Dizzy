Bill: @everyone us up north are gathering for leaving at 10 from here and getting to Sakura Sunday at 12.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'll aim to get there around then too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Made it back home
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yay!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh,  and going back to respectful footwear while wearing a yukata, I'm guessing Crocs would probably not be a good idea? ðŸ˜…
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Dont people wear sneakers with yukata in Japan? <@301927856240459777>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah we were discussing at dinner and decided sneakers would probably be okay
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but then on the way home I was thinking about how I'm wearing Kiri and was wondering if I could wear my Crocs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Are crocs not close enough to harajuku? Idk what the rules are xD sorry I'm not really helpful but I personally dont see a reason crocs wouldnt be ok if sneakers are ok
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But I know nothing so def ask mars
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Yeee sneakers be good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I donâ€™t see crocs being any worse than sneakers lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol thanks for the input y'all

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Traffic is pretty bad. Lots of asshole Philly drivers trying to cut around people
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ahhh kids begging for money by the philly zoo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I didnâ€™t have to pay to park, some policeman directed me to park down some side road

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh boi a used condom on the sidewalk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This is why cities suck
Bill: Lucky you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But yeah I guess if you enter the side by the two big pillars with statues on them theyâ€™re funneling people down a side street
Bill: Weâ€™re here too.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There's so many Asian people and I feel like I'm appropriating lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hear music so I'm following that
Bill: I think youâ€™re fine parking legally there.
Bill: The walk part is the question.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I would rather park closer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I guess thereâ€™s no parking if theyâ€™re directing people
Bill: Nope.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just donâ€™t like being alone and kinda lost
Bill: Do you want to drive over to us?
