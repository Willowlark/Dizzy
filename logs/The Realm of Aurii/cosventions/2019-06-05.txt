N👌kri (Marisa): I’d post Raphtalia but I’m covered in paint and also so is most of the costume
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is it supposed to be?
N👌kri (Marisa): The armor is drying <:pwease:555585508819075112>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🙏
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Raph is gonna look amazing too
Andrew: ^
N👌kri (Marisa): noooo it's nowhere near as good as andru's ;u;
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N👌kri (Marisa): the lining i drew on the armor is all patchy, just like the armor itself
N👌kri (Marisa): i'd say on par with how awful katarina was
El🆓de Faun (Tom): BOI
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lets see it when its done and all togethor im sure its fantastic
El🆓de Faun (Tom): just like katarina
N👌kri (Marisa): bring tomatos to throw
N👌kri (Marisa): rotten tomatos
Aldus Larian (Jess): No I refuse
N👌kri (Marisa): katarina was horrible, the skirts were all mismatched and the buttons and neckpiece wouldn't stay on properly
N👌kri (Marisa): the gloves were bluh just like these ones and the shoes were too baggy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): is this one okay
N👌kri (Marisa): shrek is so fresh

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Your Dani so good
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Well first time after you came back
N👌kri (Marisa): dani is really bad, the collar is fraying and the zipper isn't properly lined up and i think the skirt is uneven. idk i made it in like an hour
N👌kri (Marisa): what about katsucon <:woah:543194447345876998>
N👌kri (Marisa): if done properly i'd of liked to add some horsehair into the skirt to make it wavy like the webcomic
N👌kri (Marisa): i'm really glad there's a hall q&a on sunday so i can ask them how i can improve. i've never gotten feedback aside from snide comments from strangers and that one time they liked my pelon.
Aldus Larian (Jess): dani is gud
N👌kri (Marisa): But her construction is a wreck and I’m too old for that version  ;A;
Aldus Larian (Jess): cosplay has no rules
N👌kri (Marisa): Yeah but I wanna make people happy if they see a character they like and instead all they’ll get is disappointment ;u;
Aldus Larian (Jess): whomst is being but to you?!
N👌kri (Marisa): No one <:woah:543194447345876998> everyone is valid
Aldus Larian (Jess): if people are criticizing your cosplay they are being a butt. if anyone critizes you and im around to hear it imm fight em
N👌kri (Marisa): O. Ruby, Fuuko, Mirai, and Blake got the most criticisms off the top of my head. They all can be improved
Aldus Larian (Jess): IM GONNA FIGHT THEM
N👌kri (Marisa): noooo they provide valuable insight on how i can improooove
Aldus Larian (Jess): like unless its a literal competition thats not ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): did u ask for the insite tho?
N👌kri (Marisa): except fuuko apparently i'm just too old for that

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow, they're so full of blood already
Bill: Ooooh
Bill: I magic.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Toga: yandere or enthusiastic bbq attendee?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N👌kri (Marisa): omg they were talking about a yandere on forensic files last night but they didn't have the word 'yandere' so the guy was like "it's a kill out of love. either one person can have them, or no one can have them, and in this case their passion drove them to murder"
Aldus Larian (Jess): id like to think i read that in the exact way it was said on tv
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao BBQ attendee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like I don’t quite get pre con excited anymore
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I get like... dread
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I worry that the weekend will suck and I’ll have wasted so much money and time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Weird
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thanks adulting
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that understandable i think <@!351785752197201920> has said something simular
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEP

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Not dread tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Just same ol
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But once I get there it's fun
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Although I'm reasonably excited for a next
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I really like that con for some reason
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have this weird ability to just get exited over the same thing again and again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk what it is, I know it’s not the con crunch
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll definitely finish construction for toga today, with just weathering for tomorrow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have no plans too, I don’t like that
Aldus Larian (Jess): when did that start happening? maybe you just had a bad experience and it tainted da future?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): maybe youre burnt out
Bill: I have what Tom does usually.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i know i am ~~from cons~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk hal and I didn’t have a good Anext last year
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I’m worried about money cause I just dropped 415 on a flight
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I obviously have the money for Anext
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But it’s like ugh is this gonna be worth what I’m dropping on it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like no one’s going and I have no schedule so I’m just gonna stand in the middle of the con center twiddling my thumbs
Aldus Larian (Jess): your're cosplaying with rei  friday right? or is that just formal?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye for Friday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Both during the day and formal
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe it's because it's not as anticipated con as like Katsu or Zenkai? There's a good chunk of us not going to Anext so maybe it just feels like it's missing ~~more friendos~~ something?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah probably
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like somehow my brain jumped over and is excited for Otakon
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then you cosplay with me and tom on Saturday!

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why are only waterpark passes for CCE 110 dollars a day
Kaio Vermino (Lee): capitalism
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What waterpark is worth that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's how they get you to just book the rooms <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): marketing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s dumb
Bill: It’s better to have the room anyway so you can pass out drunk.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m tryna figure out what to do about the 14th cause that’s me and Noah day <:pew:543202259085950996> but I don’t want him paying 110 for _one day_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I meannnn you CAN attend CCE without drinking
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But understandable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _oop here comes the CCE dread_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *but you'll be able to legally get lit this year*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *no dread*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *just drink*

Kaio Vermino (Lee): RIP
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL no I’m the cougar 😂
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Lee): news to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The other problem is that he’s pretty chill, which works good for my control freak tendencies
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I never know his real opinion on things
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So if I ask him to come and pay 110 for the waterpark he might say yes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I don’t think he actually wants to pay that
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ooooo
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea......
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yikes
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah...
Kaio Vermino (Lee): thats how jon was too. he paid for the pass last year and i knew he prob didnt want to. RIP

Aldus Larian (Jess): its ok we were the dame person
Aldus Larian (Jess): sneak him and just tape an old wristband to his wrist
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i'll dress like ozma and we can pretend im cosplaying noah
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i shouldnt be encouraging this~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): same person
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Waterpark passes at 110 are thievery <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s not even like drink included or nothin
Kaio Vermino (Lee): you can get him a spectator pass
Kaio Vermino (Lee): he just cant do slides
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hmmmm I didn’t see that on the site
Aldus Larian (Jess): "here we see weebs in their natural habitat"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m gonna ask what he wants to do for that day to avoid getting the “it’s up to you” response
Aldus Larian (Jess): gonna hit u wit dat "what do u wanna do?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "whatever you wanna do"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Spectator Admission Pass is sold by the Kalahari for $20.99, or $20 cash only at our waterpark pass booth located outside of con ops*
– Spectator passes only allow you in the water park and DO NOT allow you to enter any pools or rides Passes are good from 10am until park closes. Purchase your passes online to guarantee admission. Sales at the gate may be closed off due to capacity.
– Please check the Kalahari website, or the water park front desk for current rates.
– This is recommended for cosplayers who aren’t going on rides.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): http://colossalcon.com/kalahari-waterpark-information/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait, that's CC Main
Kaio Vermino (Lee): jon had a spectator badge last year and went in the lazy river and in the outdoor pools and jacuzzis
Kaio Vermino (Lee): so
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i think its just anything with an attendant
Kaio Vermino (Lee): that he can not do
Aldus Larian (Jess): or the people just didnt notice/care
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ^
Kaio Vermino (Lee): it was saturday too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): was it a bracelet?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea bracelet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably doesn't look too different from the other passes then so probably no one noticed
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea i think the only difference was it was a different color
Kaio Vermino (Lee): and there were so many cosplayers that no one looked or cared
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which is easy to hide if you keep your hands under the water
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But Noah’s a dirty rule follower
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lawful Good Boi
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll see what he says
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Worst case I’ll skip out on a con day

Bill: 
Kaio Vermino (Lee): wait now i forget what the collar looks like
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oh
Kaio Vermino (Lee): wait no
Kaio Vermino (Lee): im confused
Bill: “Forget” I don’t think you’ve even seen this lens. 😂
Bill: I don’t travel with it cause it’s the size of my thigh.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oh
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i feel like a dunce now
Bill: Lol no reason to.
Bill: I use this for bird watching and the foxes.
Bill: It’s got an effective range of... 300-900? Cause it’s FX on a DX camera.
Bill: Which is totally useless for a con.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): 😮 oh shit
Bill: Unless I was going to stalk people from Katsu balconies.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): KALAHARI AD ON THE RADIO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _theyre reading the discord_
Bill:

Kaio Vermino (Lee): whats the collar thing look like

Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I've never seen it, I just hate it for the name.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): perfect for this instance though
