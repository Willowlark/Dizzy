Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@245270932602486784> we made it to my top 3!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow my reach did really well
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was gonna say I wonder what tags helped it and then I remembered I put "#cosplaygirl" in there because Georgia was in it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i can post it on my story
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): see if we can bump it to #2 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Already made it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): DAMN
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoop
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): how the fuck dont you have 1k yet erik your cosplay so good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd be closer had I not purged back in February. I was just over 800 and purged down to 660 some and I've only gained 50 some since then lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cursed spam followers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It ok. I don't really care about gaining followers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I'm still caught up on trying to boost my likes lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): I go through phases
Aldus Larian (Jess): i either care a ton or not at all
Elfriede Faun (Tom): is that most liked for this year or all time?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Part of me wants to post Red Riot Thot because I feel like that has viral potential but at the same time I kind of don't want that to go viral 😂
Elfriede Faun (Tom): truuuuuu
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaaaa thats understandable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): then people might try to copy you in an attempt to get attention <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And then they might do it bet--

Oh wait that was a dig at Hal
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've stopped losing more than 5 followers every time i make a post <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
oooOOOOooOOo
N🆗ri (Marisa): have you not posted the red riot thot?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I might put it behind a buffer image sometime
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Thotty Thursday or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): does everyone use a business profile? is it worth it?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i did once and didnt care for it
N🆗ri (Marisa): it scares me having the e-mail public
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I do because I like looking at the insights
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Email is still private
N🆗ri (Marisa): really? :0
i think i used it for like five minutes but it was a long time ago, and it required having my email public
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh wait yeah I lied
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Set it to an email account you don't use or care about?
N🆗ri (Marisa): o you can change the e-mail?
still too scary, then there might be people who get angry at me for never responding
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i'm looking for a picture to post tomorrow and i wanna know how this guy edited my face because it looks spectacular~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I use my cosplay email which I use mostly for ordering cosplay stuff or con badges
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz your face looks spectacular!
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw it's gotta be some kind of editing, other pictures of the same costume don't look anywhere near as good
N🆗ri (Marisa): so you have a totally different cosplay email? :0
i think i was gonna do that before when i considered rebranding my cosplay page years ago
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe those other pictures were just edited badly
N🆗ri (Marisa): they edit their best 🌟
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And ye I have
-My first gmail account which got overloaded with spam so I have
-My second gmail account which is also starting to get inspired with spam and messages from old accounts I rarely use which brings me to
-My third gmail which is the main one I use that's linked to mostly everything, and then
-My fourth gmail account which is my cosplay one that I use for the reasons mentioned above and then
-My fifth gmail account which I madefor my art account because I needed a new email to make that account
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woahhhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): so mannnyy
N🆗ri (Marisa): wew
i have a ton of emails that started with different purposes but now they're basically all the same and i shuffle through them
N🆗ri (Marisa): art account? :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I used to have another for the fraternity I was in as well as one for the National Board position I held before a large group of us decided to disaffiliated so those got deactivated lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://instagram.com/slendergiantart?igshid=1hp81awrkcl2t
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I thinkkk i have 2?
my middleschool one was "demon and some numbers" cuz i was a cool kid. 
Then i got a gmail with just my name cuz i figured demon wasnt a good email to have for job applications
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My first email was through a catholic site because my mom wanted me to have a safe email provider or something? It was before gmail existed I think lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I couldn't think of a good username so I just used my name backwards and the year I was born
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): kire93@catholicexchange.com
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It was a mouthful
N🆗ri (Marisa): my first email was an aol account that is currently security compromised
i had a yahoo account that's mostly spam (i'm still on the yahoo answers leaderboards though for comics and animation WOO)
i had a few yahoo accounts but i only remember the one. then i switch to making spam accounts on mail dot com where i still occasionally use magicalmeow@cheerful dot com
then gmail where i currently have five active gmails, one of which i probably will never use again and should delete but i might need it in court. one is more 'professional' and serious than the others and one is mostly spam. i have my convention pre-regs' spread across these emails lol
two school e-mails and a work e-mail, but the work e-mail technically isn't mine and i just answer the messages that get sent there
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can't use your name and birth year in an email omg that's how you get kidnapped by predators
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): doxxed
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ive had glsandidge since like 4th grade
Aldus Larian (Jess): welp guess were all getting kidknapped
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _oh no guys marisa is gonna email me_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I have my school account but I got locked out because I didn't change my password after I graduated and then I think they changed email servers so it wouldn't even be valid anyway
Elfriede Faun (Tom): oh true i might have a school account
Elfriede Faun (Tom): damn i barely remember
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hoarde school email accounts like gold
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *not anymore i guess*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): so many emails tho aghhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): id go crazy trying to track em all
Elfriede Faun (Tom): cant you filter them all into one somehow?
N🆗ri (Marisa): but then how will i continue to use all 10 of my neopets accounts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Owo I think I was able to activate my school email on the new service
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow, for 3 years of inactivity you'd think there'd be more
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh it only goes back to June 2017. That must be when they switched
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WOO NEOPETS
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Remember that one game that's just first one to click when it refreshes gets the prize or something like that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _69_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Uh?
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH I saw that last night and meant to post about it but got distracted by other stuff
*what does it mean*
N🆗ri (Marisa): It says one hour ago, did he repost it? Or is that also from last night because he posted it at 11:45pm originally
Aldus Larian (Jess): utlra sham
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): says 11 hours as of now ago so guessing that was an older screenshot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): gotta love it when people vague post to the public
N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw you haven’t unlocked the telepathy skill yet and are out of the loop
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe it’s a new Instagram thing, tiered followers and he’s trying to get more
Free followers see vagueposting
Trial followers get some random keywords that are related to the post
Silver followers see the context
Gold followers get context and the whole backstory
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): woah, how do i get the gold experience without actually becoming his friend
N🆗ri (Marisa): Lots of cash money 💰
N🆗ri (Marisa): “I’ll give you $800 to tell me what’s bothering you”
“Well, it all started in February of 1986”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wondering if I should respond
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He hasn’t contacted me since the Katsu room thing tho so also wondering if he considers me an enemy now idkkkk
N🆗ri (Marisa): That would be a mean thing to do since you had nothing to do with the Katsu room thing, aside from getting him the room this year
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could probably ask him since I have pretty good rapport with him, but I don't want to be filled with gossip fuel because honestly his business isn't our business
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone who posts about it might want people to contact them? Otherwise why post it publicly like that in a way that makes people curious 

But that is a very mature sentiment 👏
Glonk: Hmm Marisa is 3 years older than me 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***I’m so old*** 😭
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee they were talking about that at the con
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WOAH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Katsucon 2: Electric Boogaloo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Literally damn
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Sci find, fantasy and STEM learning
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmfao WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): the three corners of the triforce
N🆗ri (Marisa): they said it was basically gonna be a sci-fi themed katsucon
Bill: ~~are the rooms cheaper~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): probably a little bit the first year
Bill: if I can get a gaylord room for 200 bucks I'll go.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ill go, prob WAY less crouded
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): crowde*
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no not that cheap
rooms go for $590+ outside of a convention, on normal weekdays
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): heck
Bill: Yeah. It’s. Something.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Does nier count as sci fi <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nvm I don't need more conventions
Bill: Yeah I... don't really care about the convention. I just want a cheap room at the gaylord.
Bill: If we got rooms for 200 a night, I'd say go for the weekend, ignore the con, make full use of the gaylord facilities without the KatsuCrowd.
Bill: ~~tldr what magfest is for~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): isnt magfest like 4 days long
Bill: yup.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬
Bill: Flora loves it, Dave and Ash went this year.
Bill: Everyone spends all the time in the gaming rooms rather than on the main level so...
Bill: Gazebo for all.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): when is it
Bill: January.
Bill: ~~there's no plans for Aurii to go rn~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats like my biggest complaint about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats its even more in the dead of winter
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so unless you get really lucky outdoor photos are hard
Bill: I like the less crowded part... but the weather yeah, and Dave basically said 'Katsu overcrowded but it's more fun than mag'.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and the gazebo is great but like -shrugs- its the most overused location
Bill: Even coming from a gamer who was cosplaying an FPS game.
Bill: Which is why Katsu is still the choice.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaa... like i dont really care for anything that happens at mag
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but being able to get photos places you normally couldnt at katsu is nice... but i usually have a pretty great time at katsu even with the crowds
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so idk if id ever actually jump to mag myself unless something super ridiculous happens at katsu that makes me not want to go anymore xD
Bill: Someone hold me to not shooting too much at Katsu next year.
Bill: That'll increase my enjoyment.
N🆗ri (Marisa): plus magfest is a video game con right? not a lot of anime
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: ~~we predominantly cosplay webseries/video games~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm talking about panels
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i dont do panels~~
Bill: ~~lol panels~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but the ball is fun at katsu
Bill: Though, I should really do a photography panel.
Bill: I dunno what I would talk about specifically, cause I just. ramble things when I get going on photogrpahy.
Bill: I doubt they'd approve "Guy rambles about photography for hour" as a panel.
Bill: *But the captive audience sounds nice*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~could always do a test run at geekdom xD~~
Bill: The less the people attending geekdom know about photographing, the better. >.>
Bill: *They're the reason photogs get a bad rep*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ......good point<:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im reconsidering wearing 6O
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if i go>.>
Bill: ~~yeah we were talking about it friday it's looking like a no go~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i feel bad because its annas birthday
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and she wants to spend time with friends
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so im like....HHHHHHH
Bill: VAs are great but it's not worth the ticket, and if it's cosplaying/shooting there's no where to do that at Geekdom and I'd rather do a location shoot.
Bill: That I understand, but didn't she find other plans?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not that im aware of
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): last i heard was she was going to geekdom to  "protecc friends"
Bill: hmm.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): could always invite her to do something else with us maybe
Bill: That's what I'm thinking.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont want her to end up alone on her birthday, thats happened to me too many times
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~I wanted that last autograph too~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and thats a bad feeling
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Speakin of, we have a lot of summer birthdays, does anyone have plans to celebrate
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I know Jess had a shabang last year
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll probably do something in early August
Bill: Not at the moment. If there's nothing else in the timeframe I'd be good drinking around a fire.
Bill: No more pool tho.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You got rid of it???
Bill: We had to put so much money into this year for maintenance for how little we used it, it wasn't worth it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dayum
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Some of the houses my mom is looking at have a pool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not all but some
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I always hated having a July birthday because I feel like people always expected a pool party lol
Bill: by the time we got the pool I stopped having birthday parties.
Bill: Well, my birthday is on a wednesday, which leaves me with the first or second weekend of august. The first is right after Otakon and probably the one you'd look at, the second is right after your birthday so having two back to back events wouldn't appeal to most.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont usually have any sort of party myself, but theres potential for a group birthday celebration or something
Bill: ^^ I'll order pizzas and start a fire in the backyard, that's the extent of my caring.
Bill: And I'll drink down a bottle of bourbon.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao yea i was about to say
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): alcohol
N🆗ri (Marisa): Or Chuck E. Cheese
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): usually my depressed ass self just buys a cupcake and a 6 pack of mikes and takes the day off from work to celebrate alone
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😄
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Good thing you have a quality friend group now!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): TRUE
Bill: If I were to do something more extravagant it'd probably just be Laundromat. I do love that place.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that place is fun
N🆗ri (Marisa): Why would you go to a laundromat do they have nice fabric softener
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it usually smells nice
Bill: ~~it's a bar~~
Bill: There was meteor shower around my birthday last year actually.
Bill: I think it was an annual thing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): In accordance with the prophecy
Bill: I almost suggested going camping somewhere to see it.
Bill: ~~and drink~~
Bill: !irlRuby <mention>

Bill: Move this fight to shitpost.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok I’ll hold on to it for now until I get to a computer owo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fights over
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): *watch yer back*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O okie so I’ll probably do a thing at the NEW house
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And we can put all the summer birthdays on a cake
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I need everyone’s ugliest face that they can possibly make for the cake
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No ahegaos tho plz and thank
Bill: You’re moving so soon?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh we talking about birthdays? I'll prob try to do something similar to last year
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah the house is on the market at the end of this month
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My moms finishing up picking a house now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): we don’t need such a big house with me and lily at college soon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Plus my mom said we’ll save a bunch of money so now she might be able to contribute more towards my grad school
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When before she said I’ll have to take my own loans
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!351471675843411978> your party last year was one of my fav things about 2018 so plz do and lemme know if you get a date so I can take off
Bill: You hadn’t told us things had progressed is all.
Bill: It made sense before.
Bill: Just out of the loop.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean putting the house on the market is the first step so now y’all have been informed lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): If I did something it would prob be June 15? Gotta talk to my parents
