Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SPITS
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uhhhh whoa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Son where are you acquiring this money
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I asked if a friend could come, he was chill with it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anyone wanna make some money and ensure that I’m not mugged? lol
Nokri (Marisa): omg time for me to quit teaching and doing office work to become a model
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Marisa is the closest <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Nokri (Marisa): I can make a fan for Georgia like Kpop fans wave at concerts
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean I guess it makes sense
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I've never seen these
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I must see
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If you really wanna shoot one particular model?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeahh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Could never see myself doing that but I get it
Nokri (Marisa): Modeling is a bit like acting in that you take a long time to get ready and need to be in tip top condition so maybe the high price is because they don’t spend as much time actively working, they’re prepping instead
Nokri (Marisa): Eat a Reese’s cup whole in front of his face if he’s misogynistic
El🆓de Faun (Tom): What a way to assert dominance
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tbh he’s not a bad photographer either
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m looking for the catch 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): do you have to pay for the photos?
Nokri (Marisa): like, he pays you to take pictures but maybe won't give you any of them?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll ask
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But even still, as long as they’re flattering I’d pocket a good chunk of change lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _this is it, this is the whoring I could get used to, no one touching me_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *and free potential clothes*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): IK YALL IM TRYNA FIGURE HOW THIS COULD BE A SCAN
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Here’s his contract, no mention of copyright so I asked him straight up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He said I can post any photos where ever with credit
Nokri (Marisa): are there warrants out for his arrest
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would say have someone go with you should you decide to do it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): seems too good to be true, but like... everything checks out?
Bill: He has full use to sell your likeness I believe. For stock photos, to a magazine, whatever the case may be. That’s the model release in a nutshell.

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Look for single moms in your area!” wait a second...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): [boom picture of me]
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *going into annoyed customer mode...*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh God
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea I had to double check but tickets werent sent to me either
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Idk why they weren't sent immediately after the order was made
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, *the festival is tomorrow* so how are people going to get in if they don't send them?
Nokri (Marisa): This is the festival down in delaware?
If you somehow haven’t received your tickets by tomorrow, go to the will-call in the mall, behind the sears. Bring your ID and tell them you bought tickets but never got them.
Nokri (Marisa): Might also be able to get it at guest services.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): thanks
Nokri (Marisa): sorry
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sorry for what?
Nokri (Marisa): oh
I don’t know, i realized maybe you knew that already or had a plan already for how to handle things and thought maybe I got in your way
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nooooo 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm sorry... my response did come off kind of sarcastic sounding. I was saying "yeah" in response to "the festival down in Delaware?" And then was genuinely saying "thanks" because I wouldn't have thought to do that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hate how the tone of exting can be misread
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Your advice was very helpful. Thank you 💕
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@301927856240459777>
Nokri (Marisa): aaa, no no no, your response was fine and perfect and i didn't take it as sarcastic!!! i'm just whacked in the head is all, i read too much into issues that don't exist
Nokri (Marisa): now my apology is for making a scene, i'll go find a peace offering
Nokri (Marisa): i found a screaming powdered donut
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I accept your peace offering 💕
Bill: You are so wholesome Marisa.
