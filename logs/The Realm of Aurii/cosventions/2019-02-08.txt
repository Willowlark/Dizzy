Bill: I LOVE it.
Bill: Also Zenkai is friend con doesn’t need to be crowded.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye but that means our funding is down 40% of what it was were last year
N🆗ri (Marisa): Zenkai is nonprofit so all proceeds go to holding the con and the rest goes to charity
N🆗ri (Marisa): Who went to Kogaracon last year? Did they have any anime trivia panels?
I want to submit a panel but idk what. Trivia, or maybe a history panel if people wanna learn stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s on homestuck day so we obviously have to cosplay homestuck
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh yeah looks like they had a ton of trivia and gameshow panels so that’s out. There was a whole room just for them. 

Do you think anyone would be interested in a weeb history lecture? The origins of anime/manga/cons
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do u think I’d get beat up telling people their precious Japanese cartoons are all American in origin <:thinku:543194478614413318>  🤔
Bill: No. We went to kogarafest, which is smaller kogaracon. I don’t remember the panels, but submit what you want to do.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I remember absolutely wrecking all the scrubs at kogarafest’s anime name that tune
Dirty Lego (Tom): My problem I have with zenkai doesn't actually stem from zenkai itself
Dirty Lego (Tom): The locals were kinda dicks
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah. We tried to put up with them for a few years. The first year was nice and very welcoming, we were told to let the locals in the hotel so they could see the con. After a few years though they started harassing us and that’s why the convention center is exclusively Zenkaikon only now. The locals would wander in drunk and cause all sorts of issues with attendees.
N🆗ri (Marisa): They’ve forgotten what a massive boon we bring to Lancaster’s economy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yes people made rude comments to is when we would wander away from the con center a little bit
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT
I’m gonna beat them up with my staff badge
Meg and I were harassed during one of her photo shoots too, they kept catcalling her and she wasn’t even wearing anything skimpy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Unless full sleeves are skimpy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe they’re so close to Amish territory that any girl who has visible skin is a charlatan
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We heard someone warning people to "stay away from the freaks"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Another group oh REALLY hipset dudes in a cafe were just like making fun of anime and the fans in general
N🆗ri (Marisa): there was a local business meeting a couple years ago in one room the con wasn’t using. We put up cones and had staff directing traffic away from that area and attendees were joking that we were keeping them away from the normies but we were really keeping an eye on the businessmen because they were making horrible comments
N🆗ri (Marisa): Con attendees don’t cause trouble but locals do
N🆗ri (Marisa): We’ve had people throw things at attendees like popcorn or trash
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like the con was great but trying to get coffee or food out of the direct area of the con was def a damper
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's such bullshit. I considered going to college there too cuz thought the city was really pretty and stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That sucks. Sorry to hear it. Staff usually don’t leave the building all weekend, or if we do it’s just to go to the fountain or something.
N🆗ri (Marisa): It is a nice looking area
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I like the city itself but not whole in cosplay 😂
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah,the city is pretty but the residents are stinky
Dirty Lego (Tom): The greeter at the hotel at geekdom was actually super nice
Dirty Lego (Tom): He was excited to see everyones costumes
Dirty Lego (Tom): But the crazy lady at the food place next door canceled out his good energy
Dirty Lego (Tom): She def thought we were summoning Satan or something
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That hotel guy was like the best part 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): Was geekdom also in lancaster? I thought it was at the old zenkai location in oaks :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh nooo crazy lady nooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea it was in oaks
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sorry for a quick change of topic, you can change it back but this has me so mad.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I blocked them but I can tell how scathing and mean this is even without being fluent in Spanish
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh no whats the gist of it
N🆗ri (Marisa): *my picture would only show up if you searched the tags for it you punk*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Only thing I'm getting is something about an ignorant saber
N🆗ri (Marisa): Calling me a whore with no morals who’ll rot in hell. The usual.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): Insulting my chest and calling me out for wearing shorts
N🆗ri (Marisa): Something about my mother and the B word
Dirty Lego (Tom): Random person?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh
Dirty Lego (Tom): I didn't didnt realize finding a random persons post and hurling insults was the norm
N🆗ri (Marisa): I bet they live in Lancaster <:lenny:395307171539189760> n
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What post is this on?
N🆗ri (Marisa): The nowi one I posted today
N🆗ri (Marisa): Like yeah it’s a bathing suit. Ok.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You delete?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I blocked them and I guess it deleted their comment
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Good
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's shitty
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah good
N🆗ri (Marisa): The original screenshot with comments from wonderful people
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That person is cancelled
N🆗ri (Marisa): Death
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like.okay it's shorts and like a bathing suit top
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like what
N🆗ri (Marisa): I am a beacon of sin
Dirty Lego (Tom): Just Google butt on insta there's way more
Dirty Lego (Tom): So odd
Dirty Lego (Tom): Nah that exact post
Dirty Lego (Tom): Maybe that person wanted to get nowi but got silly instead and was real mad about it
Dirty Lego (Tom): So they searched the tags for now to insult every now cosplay
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea like??? Why this post?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like it's insta, naked people everywhere
N🆗ri (Marisa): They looked like some kind of company insta trying to promote something
N🆗ri (Marisa): Very professional comment
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Very professional
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Anyway don't listen to dat noise
N🆗ri (Marisa): They were using super vulgar language too. If you try to make a point about how I’m such a sinful person at least clean up your language and quit using slang
N🆗ri (Marisa): Too late I’m worthless garbage <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NOPE
Dirty Lego (Tom): How do I like a picture twice 🤔
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They garbage, you a sparkly jewel
N🆗ri (Marisa): Unlike picture
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m a Steven universe character wow
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye
Dirty Lego (Tom): The best compliment money can buy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Here’s your $2000
Dirty Lego (Tom): You exist in the Lions' mane
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ahh the airless interdimensional void
Dirty Lego (Tom): Idk much, but I know there's a Lions mane 🙏
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah there’s some grass and a couple trees in there! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Your head pops out it's okay
Dirty Lego (Tom): You can breathe
N🆗ri (Marisa): The lion is dead <:rip:369476083248267274>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pink zombie lion
Pink zombie space captain
Dirty Lego (Tom): 😱 😱 😱
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): omg post that in bne
N🆗ri (Marisa): oof. i don't like how kogaracon lists the full name and e-mail of all their panelists on their website
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't like that at all. i might not submit a panel because of that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there are people who have desperately tried to get my email who i do not want contacting me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats so weird wtf
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it doesn't make sense
http://kogaracon.com/activities/panels/
N🆗ri (Marisa): there are people who don't have e-mails listed with them but I know they're people who help run the con
Bill: You can ask them to make an except for it. Request privacy.
Bill: @ inkfall on instagram Jess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's no "other" field in the panel submission form for requests like that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but you cant swim in it 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): i would use one of my throwaway emails but i never check those, and if there are any panel updates i'd need to know. it sucks that my name is so unique otherwise i could play it off as "oh that's another person with the same name. not me."
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~makes a 32nd email account and forwards all messages to one i use~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is kogara free?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): neat
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm.

N🆗ri (Marisa): im gonna submit this unless that description sucks because i can't think of a description
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): SIGN ME TF UP
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sounds good!
N🆗ri (Marisa): are u sure 👀

but this is gonna be a LOT of info packed into an hour and im gonna regret choosing such a broad topic lol. i hope there's time for a quiz at the end.
N🆗ri (Marisa): covering at least uhhh 800 years of history
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you can do it!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this is for kogara?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye you do good
Dirty Lego (Tom): ye
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'd go
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotta think of prizes to give out
N🆗ri (Marisa): because people need prizes
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have some doubles of stuff I could give out but it might be a little TOO good for prizes <:awawa:543194342001606656>
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, autographs and out-of-print stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): and dvds. i gave out dvds at my last panel lol

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YES
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _i have to start studying_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): when are panel apps due?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Tonight 🙀
Bill: Fuckall I need to get back to grey towers... That was last week already.
Bill: I'm decidedly not in the mood for that though...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you're going again?
Bill: I'd like to, before they open for the season. It's free and the woman there is very nice, she'd let me book a couple days up there easy.
Bill: I have a Weiss shoot idea, if Georgia can cut time out... but putting that aside it'd be a good place. Can't bring all of BNE, but small group would be fine.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i don think i have any cosplays that fit the location
N🆗ri (Marisa): We’ll make some
N🆗ri (Marisa): H o o k y
N🆗ri (Marisa): There are a lot of Spanish comments on my nowi cosplay and they freak me out after that mean one. These ones are nice but why so many Spanish comments all of a sudden. I think someone shared my post somewhere.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait no it’s the same guy leaving good comments 4 hours apart. Why.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHAT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like the same guy that insulted you last night?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): or dif guy?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): can you read spanish?
N🆗ri (Marisa): No a different guy or at least a different account
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah to an extent
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): whoa
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you neat
N🆗ri (Marisa): no no
10 years of Spanish in public education
Bill: Nier would work. Forest Castle.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hhhhhooky
Bill: Also very valid.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont cosplay that sillies
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s it suit up you’re all cosplaying hooky
N🆗ri (Marisa): Guess again
Bill: ~~Guess again~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~if you're making it for me maybe~~
Bill: *Careful think about who you're talking to*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah biru will make all your costumes in a heartbeat
Bill: In hindsight I'd rather not have my face as an emoji. It's already bad enough as it is, so I removed that one.
N🆗ri (Marisa): F for biru emoji
Bill: Sundays May 5th and May 19th are the days I'm thinking of... Pretty sure May 26th the castle is open. Also could do a saturday or sunday the weekend of CPAC, cause I dunno what the feel for CPAC is.
Bill: 19th is the latest weekend we can do it (for warmth), but is day after fireball mountain.
Bill: I gotta think about it. General RWBY would work, cause ruins type look, Weiss thing, Nier for the forest zone, then I don't know what else... My thought was to do two bookings and run with it... I suppose they won't care about the documentation much, s'long as we don't show in masse...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i prob wouldnt do rwby
Bill: I'm trying to be a bit more inspired since I'm planning it anyway.
Bill: Just thinking aloud.'
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||hooky||
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): C A R D
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They are thick AF
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They feel like playing cards or even thicker
N🆗ri (Marisa): THEY LOOK SO NICE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THANK  the pics look good on them too which is a relief
Bill: You enthusiasm is nice Mawisa.
Bill: Look good. ~~Now I know which of mine you use~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Biru look how nice they look
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess look how nice they look
Bill: I’m only surprised by Nejire tho. I didn’t think that was special.
Bill: I meant about shoot. And Jess too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m always enthusiastic about shoots pew pew
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): She's not but I look good in that pic
Bill: I meant the photo wasn’t special not that you weren’t!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh I like it!
Bill: I wasn’t super impressed with those, but it was a really quick shoot so I wrote it off to that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think is good pic
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg my new bra I got for 2b is so much better I'm so happy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Biru I should be able to pay the Katsu room around Monday
N🆗ri (Marisa): Also Monday: last minute Katsu amazon shopping spree
Bill: Yay!
Bill: I should check who did that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): If there’s lots of people who haven’t paid yet I can say the same thing in the Facebook chat to remind them
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have to add up the total again<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Dirty Lego (Tom): ALMOST CAN SHOOT PEOPLES HEADS OFF
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~i forget the amount~~

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Link doesn't work
Bill: I have been stuffed by my own website.
