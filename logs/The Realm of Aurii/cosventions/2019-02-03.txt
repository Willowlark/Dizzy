N🆗ri (Marisa): ray's blue rose is so big you can't see any of the smaller flowers he has unnecessarily added on his boutonniere
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to break out the glue gun
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He's so extra
Bill: You girls and your edgy white haired boi.
N🆗ri (Marisa): So flowery
N🆗ri (Marisa): Might need some leaf trimming but boutonniere is done I’m done idk how it’ll attach to the shirt but bahhh
N🆗ri (Marisa): I gotta fix the rose oops
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It pretty!
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s like bigger than my face
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Good
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Omg that so cute!
Bill: Will you guys ever cosplay Tokyo ghoul real couple Tomu/Jess?
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's on the list <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Wow
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Labinnak makes 1K a month off Patreon
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Accentkisses makes 1.2K
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Damn
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I ain’t doin it, but D A M N
N🆗ri (Marisa): w h a t
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to start a patreon
Dirty Lego (Tom): Damn
Dirty Lego (Tom): Labinak I get somewhat but I have always felt like ancient kisses doesn't put out much so I'm surprised
Dirty Lego (Tom): Must be the few lewd shoots
Bill: ^
Bill: Zeikani has a 3:30 shoot she forgot about and suggested a later shoot than the 3 to 4. I’d rather not merge our golden hour shoot to include more people, so I’m inclined to push up a half hour/hour. If you don’t want to 2butt that long Jess you aren’t... really missing out, so you can skip that. <@!245270932602486784> can you do any earlier? (I’m more concerned about convenient for me/ our later shoot since she’s bringing this up less than two weeks before con)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea but... I'm probably gonna change whenever Tom changes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Can’t do later, but I could change earlier
Bill: I’m going to suggest 2:30 to 3:15. Not too much earlier.
Bill: ,...
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): wut
Bill: Last I’m willing to work with is is 2 to 2:45. That still fine with you?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yah that’s prob the earliest I wanna go
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Works for meeee
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): this is kinda last minute to realize this...
Bill: It’s fine if you don’t want to go that early. If it blows up it’s on her.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Nah 2 is the earliest I wanna do for bumping up my changing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I COULD do 1:30 but I’d feel rushed
N🆗ri (Marisa): There are multiple Kiko cosplayers and I got really confused when I saw Kiko was doing rwby hehe
The Kiko I know has a weird hatred for rwby
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That only leaves me 3 hrs in mononoke 😔
Bill: I won’t go earlier than 2. Physically can’t.
Bill: Skip it Jess, really. You’re going to want photos later in the day anyway.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Are you wearing something before Mononoke?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like I wanna shoot with her but... We already have Justin as 9s soooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No I set my wake up time as 8:30 cuz it's still "vacation"
Bill: Ye there’s no reason to ride this crazy train.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But that takes out Tom too unless he decides otherwise but if he changes then I'll probably change
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): If I take my change time down to 30 mins instead of an hour and don't leave buffer before the shoot I could still make it I think
Bill: Her loss, not yours. I think she forgot you two were coming (she’s clearly scatterbrained) anyway so there’s no pressure on you.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So we could bump zeikani to earlier and just do 30 mins of her and me
Bill: She said 2 is fine. So consider the slot 2 to 3.
Bill: We can eat and chill 3 to 4, then meet for Nier group. (That shoot technically 4:30 but I wouldn’t argue with more time to shoot 5 people, multiple in new costumes)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Right I forgot about eating
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So cancel zeikani entirely?
Bill: 2. We do 2.
Bill: Zeikani 2-2:45. 
Next shoot is Nier at 4:30 - 5:30. 
3- 4 we can lunch. If we eat quickly, I’m open to shooting earlier to get more time for groups and solos.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Kk sounds gucci
Bill: I want new cards, but I’m incredibly unmotivated to put my photos on them. I want to just do a design with my seal and info. Think I can get away with that as a photographer?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Honestly? Not really
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If only cause people judge your shooting style off the bat
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): They’re more hooked on shooting with you if they see an example of your work already and go “oh I like”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But if they just see your seal, they have to be motivated to google you up
Bill: Fuckall. Pictures look like shit on business cards anyway, just put the effort into looking at my Instagram.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If you wanna meet more people, hooking with with photography is a good method /shrug
Bill: I barely give cards out anyway, so I supposed it’s not a thing I have to do anyway..
Bill: We’ve had that discussion before.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye and it still a good idea
Bill: Tho, my old cards only have a black and white bird picture on them so the handful of people who followed up in the past did it without cosplay reference on the card.
Bill: Tho the only people to follow up are people who I do a shoot with, rather than halls. Like the RWY from Kotori.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Exaaactly
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Untapped potential
Bill: Those scenarios don’t happen very often... since the shoot group is usually people I know.
Bill: If I was shooting all your Pyrrha groups, that’d be the idea. One person I do know, meet new people through that. Persona will be that actually.
Bill: Impromptu shoot shoot is harder to put together. Especially at bigger con.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You can still give them to hall shots
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m tryna help ya here, you wanted to meet new peeps yeah?
Bill: I would if I took any. Its just not fun to do hall shots anymore, cause they feel all half assed compared to what I can do with 15 minutes you know? They aren’t worth the upload time.

I understand that and it’s appreciated.
Bill: The scenario is finding ways to do more like what I did at Kotori, or our persona shoot.
Bill: Because quite frankly I wouldn’t contact a photographer again over any of my hall shots. They’re just... boring.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Okaaaay if you say sooooo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean I contacted you out of a group shoot
Bill: I was about to say, group shoots are different.
Bill: Why I’m glad we’re going to RWBY’s Friday.
Bill: Wish we did the BNHA one at ANYC.
Bill: I need to approach those differently I think though. Mingle more.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye but that’s hard cause you wanna focus on getting good photos
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what time is the rwby shoot on friday?
Bill: 2?
Bill: Ye 2.
Bill: There’s not much I can do to take a good photo weirdly enough. I can’t move or get a better angle or offer a suggestion. So the quality of the photo comes from the quality of the cosplayer, if they’re comfortable in front of the group and posing well.
Bill: All I have to do is watch for that shoot.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye but don’t that take focus?
Bill: I find that... lonely in the last year. I get jealous sitting up in front shooting quietly while all my friends at the shoot are chatting off to the side.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cosplay cosplay cosplay
Bill: I already bought Hazel for Zenkai. Assuming it shows up, Chinese New Year means they won’t start till like dev 20th.
Bill: If you mean for Katsu, given the crowds last year, my gear needs, and shoot schedule I’d rather stay comfortable.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean i just mean whenever
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: Resident evil doesn’t have much of a cosplay community but maybe with remake2 going so well.
N🆗ri (Marisa): It used to have a huge community
N🆗ri (Marisa): There were meet ups at a lot of cons in days gone by
Bill: There’s one at Katsu.
Bill: Forget when.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh it’s got one at Katsu yeah Friday at 4
Bill: If there isn’t one at Zenkai I’ll likely make one.
Bill: I could go to the start of it before I shoot mina!
Bill: Is Mina easy to move in Jess?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like phsyically?
Bill: Yeah.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea she stretchy
Bill: Mmkay. She has no prop iirc and BNHA girls get so little screentime... I think all we’ll have to run with is super hero and genki girl poses.
Bill: So being able to crouch and stretch will help with the prior.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Barf up acid
Bill: No but also if you can.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~whats a genki girl?~~
Bill: Even if we had a fake acid like? What would you even do with jay, rub it on your hands?
Bill: Nora type. Hyper, smiles, cute.
Bill: Lots of v fingers.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Beat people up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo yea i can do that
Bill: Unless you have any head canons so those are the archetypes we’ll shoot with.
N🆗ri (Marisa): lovin' how i can't access the website to view the zenkai staff meeting online
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Do the Wonder Woman power poses
N🆗ri (Marisa): go through the YMCA dance for poses
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): <@!184437198865563648> What’s your schedule look like Friday of Katsu?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Scott is too nervous to ask about shoots himself lol
Bill: Booked out.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Solid?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Could he perchance hop in a few of our 3.0 shots?
Bill: Yes.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): GG Bill, you sure you’re not gonna overwork yourself this year?
Bill: I’m not because I made my slots and stuck to them. I have time built in to breath.
Bill: Though Marisa and Leanna are “sometime eventually in the evening” for Penny and Katarina so. They’ll try and give me an ulcer.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tru
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So then can he hop in a couple of my morning shots? I mean he’s being Nora so it works lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I’m not even gonna make it to full 3.0 at this point, no time to remake greaves
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But at least the neckpiece got a major upgrade it sorely needed
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Physics internships just really have been kicking my ability to work on cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): can i follow y'all and shadow ur pictures
im free friday until noon
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): OwO Marisa I would be okay with dah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Do YOU think you could get a few of Scott? He’s a good boi
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He can pay in candy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Not alcohol cause that’s illegal
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye! if biru is too busy i can take some
i accept payment in wishes and the dreams of children
N🆗ri (Marisa): would that be in the morning or afternoon?
Bill: Yeah I’d prefer that. I wanted the solo shoot.
Bill: So I’d rather not have it end up a group.
N🆗ri (Marisa): when do you guys wanna play yaoi cookie russian roulette
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Mornin!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I shall relay to Scott
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Thank 🙏
N🆗ri (Marisa): 👍
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): What’s yaoi cookie Russian roulette
N🆗ri (Marisa): i brought russian roulette cookies back from japan, 12 cookies and 2 of them have like wasabi or jalapeno paste or something in them. i was gonna get the tsundere girl version (milder than yandere which had 10 spicy cookies out of 12), but then i saw there was a yaoi version so i bought that instead.
might just be the box art that has yaoi but perhaps the cookies make you homo? idk
N🆗ri (Marisa): o if scott wants to see samples of my old photos lemme know ill send a link
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@351785752197201920>  is hype for cookie roulette
N🆗ri (Marisa): a thrilling game of mystery and suspense
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ahhhh I wanna play
Bill: Probs when we reconvene after sunset.
Bill: Or maybe at a pj party.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeee pj party is good plan
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Then BNE can play too
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And nah Scott is okay, he mostly wants to make friends and just snap a few photos
Bill: Is too small a set for whole BNE.
Bill: She did it for Aurii.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah only 12 cookies <:rip:369476083248267274>
get yer closest 12 nakama together
N🆗ri (Marisa): how many people are staying in the hotel rooms combined?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~watch we do it with 10 people and the 2 cookies not chosen are the two spice ones~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): if we did it with 6 people everyone could have 2 cookies. double the danger.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sine bnha party got pushed up I might nyx oh Nora again cuz of the body paint (one day I'll make a real decision on this
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think we have in the holtel rooms but if just do our room I think is six?
Bill: Understandable. Our room is six unless Georgia was going to hop.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she hop in for cookie
N🆗ri (Marisa): "sorry guys we need georgia for a SUPER SECRET MEETING that doesn't involve cookies at all. no entry."
Bill: ~~Depending when people arrive i will actually tell people they can’t come into our side~~
Bill: Boudoir stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): "gotta pay the entry fee and subscribe to patreon to enter during these hours"
Bill: Though technically that Jess/Tom/your discretion.
Bill: Tom: I just need my comfort Dave
Dave: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Jesssss you’ll do Nora at Zenkai if Imma Hazel right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah has anyone decided what's happenin' for zenkai
i know my schedule now
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i cosplay on duty i have to have my shirt visible at all times, but my shifts should end around 11:00pm thursday, 8:30pm friday, 6:30pm saturday, and 3:30pm sunday (peeps will mostly have left by then though). i can go to all the night stuff. uwu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Which day?
Bill: Why are you all that late shift? =/
Bill: Saturday? Whenever the RWBY shoot is, not the Greek homestuck day.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's when the dealer's hall closes. i might have time friday morning because it doesn't open until 2, but dealer's security is also in charge of autograph security so if there are any autograph sessions scheduled that early it's a toss-up
Bill: Why are you working the whole day though I thought it was shifts.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): we have to work 24 hours over the weekend, and the dealer's hall is basically open 24 hours total
N🆗ri (Marisa): friday 2-8 (6 hours)
saturday 10-6 (8 hours)
sunday 10-3 (5 hours)
so it's open 19 hours and i need 5 more hours filled
Bill: Booo you won’t be able to hang out during the day at allll
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can stare and make finger guns if you're in the vicinity
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean I don't have set cosplays yet, I wasn't really planning on Nora for zenkai but
Bill: I kinda figured Nora wasn’t high on your list... why I was asking. It’s okay if you skip her, just curious.
Bill: ~~You’ll have a totally valid excuse to hit me with a large hammer, that’s a plus~~
Bill: I cannot imagine Tom wants to do Ren either.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Haven't thought to much about zenkai but I'll see if I/we can fit it in?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What time is shoot?
Bill: 2 I think. This isn’t concrete planning, Zenkai can wait till after Katsu.
N🆗ri (Marisa): does anyone go to raves
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sometimes!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think Rayna is working on Ruby, Kurtis is working on Roman, your working on Hazel so we'll see cuz that lot of new people cosplaying rwby
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~and maybe Marisa too~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i only have season 1 outfits / pyrrha's dance outfit / neon, and i'll most likely be working during the shoot
i could wear the staff t-shirt over my ruby outfit but the cape would block the back of the shirt
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ohhh ya
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH so i was talking con stories with someone recently and remembered some really good ones
N🆗ri (Marisa): the vic mignyana stuff reminded me of one
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's kind of unofficially banned at zenkaikon since rumors say he was caught in a closet with an underage girl
N🆗ri (Marisa): but they're just rumors so idk the validity of it
N🆗ri (Marisa): him and todd did draw in a ton of guests that year
N🆗ri (Marisa): but it reminded me of a few years ago, we had a new member on staff. i forget his name it starts with a J so i'll say joe.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~cosplay comedian joe is a whole other tale of crazy stories have any of you ever met him. ouch.~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg .. <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): so joe is on duty but it's very lax and easygoing, so he's helpin' attendees and just patrolling the area watching for anything suspicious. he sees a girl by herself and goes up and starts flirting with her and such. girl talks for a moment but starts getting uncomfortable and walks away.

about 10 minutes later this huge guy marches up to our info table. he is angry. he demands to see joe (probably got the name off the staff badge). he says his 15 year old daughter was uncomfortable with his very forward advances and it is wholly inappropriate for staff to be acting that way. we agree about the behavior part, but this dad is literally out for blood and spewing death threats. we get on the radio and put out a call for joe asap. no response. every 5 minutes we put out a call for him to get back to the info desk NOW because this father is literally looking to murder him. 45 minutes later he strolls up all casually, radio off, "what's up? heard you guys were looking for me?"

we order him into the staff suite asap because if the dad spots him he is dead where he stands. so away he goes to hide. later in the day there's a weird dude in like, a half-crossplay standing by the door for a while. we go up to him to make sure everything is ok. it's joe in a ridiculous getup, pink sparkly wig and like 6 skirts with pants. he's incognito because the staff suite people got sick of him but he couldn't leave without a disguise or he was dead.
Bill: Yeah Zenkai should have a day of BNE RWBY going on.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Rip Joe
N🆗ri (Marisa): then there's kind of the unofficial reason zenkai has a formal ball.

before we had a ball, we just had the raves, sometimes a concert. this was very obvious on our website and nowhere was a formal ball ever mentioned. one year there was a situation escalated to the con chair, where our chair was berated and screamed at by some lady because we didn't have a cosplay ball and she spent thousands of dollars on gowns for her daughters so they could attend the ball, and how they were so upset they wouldn't be able to dance and look pretty and such. the lady yelled at our chair for like two hours.

we implemented the ball in the next year or two.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG bitch check the damn schedule
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Seems Saturday is RWBY day
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m leaning towards Weiss
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause Rebecca got V4 Blek
Bill: go buy a scarf then.
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is really funny
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Oof putting on the armor, I’m not particularly hype to cosplay fallout
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): My suit looks too clean, and I’m not quite sure how to dirty it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And if I do, I run the risk of totally screwing it up beyond repair two weeks before con
Bill: You’ve gotten a shitton of use out of the vault suit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait until the con and then roll around in the dirt a bit
tie your hair up first so it doesn't get dirty
Bill: Tbh I’m not surprised it’s feeling old.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean i planned my line up not knowing that 76 was going to mcsuck
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Maybe I’ll try weathering it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Lightly, at first
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like doesn’t it just look too clean?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Bill: Or do something different you have.
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmmm yeah the blue i see what you mean. is there something temporary you could use like baby powder to make it a little dusty or something
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean technically nin the game it's been frozen with the sole survivor for 200yrs whole everything else has been rolling around in the dirt
Bill: Oh well, you did make shiskabob.
Bill: That’d be worth showing off.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Shishabob looks NEATO
Bill: Rip up so clothes and be a raider.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye shishkebab is fun
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tbh I learned some new sewing techniques so I kinda wanna make one clean vault suit and one dirty
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m weighing the pros and cons of attempting to weather the one I have
Bill: Iirc vault suit currently has a couple popped seams right?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ummmm all are currently repaired but the seams are prone to popping cause my machine had bad tension at the time
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I kinda wanted to try like a stretch denim
Bill: That’d look neat.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But also I shouldn’t be remaking cosplays into infinity, I should just be satisfied and make something new oof
Bill: Probably hold up better.
Bill: Do what’s fun. You like fallout. You aren’t playing or watching new things because school. So you keep working on what your enjoy.
Bill: Worst comes to worst you could do a full day A2.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I want to try weathering it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m just scared to
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m not super happy with beastlord yet either idk why
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I didn’t really know what I was doing and winged it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Whhhaaaat? Nah it looks awesome gurl
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Thank, I am doing my bestest
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean I like Ann, but I didnt make her
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I love the shishkebab but it’s only a prop
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The Pyrrha neckpiece is 100 times better
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I haven’t finished A2 yet oof
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you'll be okay!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I be leaf in you
N🆗ri (Marisa): b i g !
