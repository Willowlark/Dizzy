Nokri (Marisa): Zenkaikonâ€™s new con chair is driving this con into the ground
Nokri (Marisa): Getting rid of staffers who have worked there for 10 years. Unbelievable.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> I am assuming you'll be skipping CCE due to your NASA internship, is that right?
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Damn that's awful
Nokri (Marisa): if they don't change things, i won't be surprised if zenkai goes under in the next couple of years
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeaaaah gonna have to :/
Andrew: That's a shame
Bill: mm. Understandable though, though we expected it'd be Next and Ota you'd miss rather than CCE lol
Andrew: I still was considering volunteering but it doesn't sound like a good idea now
Nokri (Marisa): georgia you're only doin' a day trip to otakon right?
Nokri (Marisa): so it'd be otakon and cce she's missing this year rather than next and otakon?
Nokri (Marisa): non-magical voodoo doll time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye Iâ€™ll only be there Saturday!
Nokri (Marisa): friday and sunday: flat georgia
it's like flat stanley but georgia
Nokri (Marisa): is this..... ok? <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
i don't know who the haikyuu cosplayer is anymore, or the idols. what if they see this and sue me
Aldus Larian (Jess): That looks great! 
I wouldn't worry too much about it
Nokri (Marisa): jess pls don't sue me
Nokri (Marisa): i gotta remake it anway because it doesn't fit oops
Nokri (Marisa): i hope this doesn't sound bad or racist, but i want to include the haikyuu maid because she has a darker skin color, and black cosplayers can sometimes be cautious/picky with photographers because many don't know how to properly photograph people with dark skin. i have other shoots that I've done with black cosplayers but I unfortunately didn't really know what I was doing, so they didn't come out as good
like this roxy from 5-6 years ago
Nokri (Marisa): i photographed her again years later, i wonder if i can find any pics
Nokri (Marisa): yeah! it... still wasn't very good oops sorry miss
Bill: She looks fine. I can understand the trepidation tho.
Nokri (Marisa): eve was in that shoot too hehe
Nokri (Marisa): everyone was melting that day
Nokri (Marisa): the issue was we had this awesome spot right on the pier, but a sunset shimmer cosplayer kicked us away for her mlp gathering that nobody showed up to
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah that makes sense and it's good you want to be inclusive!
Nokri (Marisa): i want everyone to like their costumes and have pictures of themselves ;u;
Bill: Thatâ€™s the purest of moods. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Bill: Why so pure
Nokri (Marisa): YO IVE HAD THE BEST SAMPLES HIDDEN IN MY DROPBOX THIS WHOLE TIME and then my computer froze haha rip
Nokri (Marisa): No u

Nokri (Marisa): this had to be one of my best cons for shooting

Andrew: Not to distract fromt hese amazing pictures but im going through the Ota guest list and realized theres like 6 people i want to meet and get autographs
Andrew: Including Pharas VA
