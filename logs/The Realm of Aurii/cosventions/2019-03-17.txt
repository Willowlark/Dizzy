Bill: I'mma need a light stand mount for the speedlights that'll mount an umbrella too.

N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a great picture but it doesn't look like cosplay does it? i thought it was a painting/drawing until someone said it was their picture from katsucon
Andrew: any sugggestions on letting me use my phone through gloves
N🆗ri (Marisa): that phone letting use paint for gloves
N🆗ri (Marisa): or your nose
Bill: suffer, basically.
Andrew: never give up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Leanna knows the paint you should be able to use
Bill: These light stands have some kind of non standard mount and I'm getting frustrated. I dunt wanna buy new ones.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Nano tips  on amazon <@141729881779077121>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I can also bring it to zenkai but it takes like 12 hours to cure

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 9/15 of my projects of interest were at Maryland tho so if I’m accepted that’s good odds
Bill: Nice.

Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea we probs going
Tikur (Kurtis): No idea? Perhaps
Bill: Oof.
Bill: Is a tight boi but if you don’t look at me gut it kinda got a “muscle” vibe and that the perk of husky Mirio?
Bill: Could maybe get the Asian *5xl* by con but lazy? It passible ?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It works
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye looks fine to me
Bill: I'mma order the bigger one anyway on the just in case I think... See what I'm feeling between the options. It's quite a bit of gut. Worst case, I have one to wear casually.
Bill: It's only 26 bucks. ~~There's only so many times I can say "It's only money" before it becomes money~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I need to get some uniforms at some point but I'd need to have them custom made
Bill: oof.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): When you need the pants length of the xl but the waist of the medium and the top of the large... 😩

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah $10
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's what I'm looking at now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If I can ever find a good solid light gray blazer that fits me, I could just make it
Bill: I’ve liked what I’ve gotten from them. But. I still haven’t gotten Hazel and Barry so.
Bill: Fucking Chinese new ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah :/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was warned about that when ordering my zentai suit so I made sure to get it earlier
Bill: Shrug. Can Hazel for Next or Ota.
Bill: Barry... unless people get into RE I mean...
Bill: https://rwby.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:181491?useskin=oasis at the bottom of the page someone did SVGs for the lien... could you make some with that cardstock Jess?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): who's have thought that finding a solid light gray blazer would be so difficult... everything is either tweed or has a slight plaid to it
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm not understanding what a lien is or what you want it for
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lien = RWBY currency
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh... I was thinking lien like a car loan
Bill: And Pilot boi only cares about the money.
Aldus Larian (Jess): But money is paper 😯
Bill: Lien is card like.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo ok
Bill: They pay with credit cards it weird.
Bill: But also paper prints would fall apart in my pocket or get wrecked.
Bill: If you could get in trouble it okay tho.
Bill: Only prop to have outside of the helmet or like, an airship.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh snap the red resin hardened!!!! Boi!!!!!

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably one of the characters that I cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): what a great idea
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do you guys stick to so few characters
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lack of funds and/or motivation to make/buy more costumes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or lack of space to store more costumes
N🆗ri (Marisa): just throw out or sell regular clothes
Andrew: may do ryoma and or soldier. Will at l;east have All might for sure
Andrew: I want to make one or two more
N🆗ri (Marisa): **that's the spirit**
