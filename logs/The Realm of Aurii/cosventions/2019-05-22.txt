Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Android 18? Nah fem mirio
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): That actually looks really good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh wait Saturday is RWBY day for AnimeNEXT okay I will schedule accordingly
Bill: NICE
Bill: It‚Äôs a waste to turn it into Mirio.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Nah it's fun wig practice for me xD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like that you conveniently have a shirt that looks like hers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Its... close enough xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Mines black and white and I edited it lighter which I did a pretty bad job on LMAO but it's fine it works
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YO WHAT A GOOD 18
Bill: Georgia I‚Äôm considering you cohosting rwby. I can‚Äôt tag your page and I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt want your private account tagged as cohost.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My private account is fine
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That‚Äôs why I dont have my last name
Andrew: ohhhh rip the MHA shoot is same time as OW
Andrew: the decisions
Nokri (Marisa): that wig is absolutely perfect for that cosplay <:woah:543194447345876998>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tho in the future I‚Äôd probably try to figure out how to tag my cosplay account
Nokri (Marisa): if you have an account hosting something i think the event has to be created and hosted from that page
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Damn
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!245270932602486784> if you ever need labels or visual references for any future Fallout props, the person Vince found one of his Futurama beer labels from has a lot: https://www.deviantart.com/emptysamurai/gallery/
Bill: The Jessie‚Äôs will be at Next, I should see if they wanna shoot. Not that I need more couple friends but they‚Äôre beautiful so.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damn I still wanna do ncr ranger
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But DP I
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I should remake rens guns too ü§î Georgia has inspired me
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm.so much better now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah! do it!
Bill: ~~yay you‚Äôre still going to do renora cause y‚Äôall gotta beat me up~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I also need to do ashitaka and fix my ten tassels
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And do Lelouch and kaneki
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): that's the spirit!
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: Bnha is 12-2, rwby 2-3, fire emblem 3-4.
Bill: Oof.
Bill: That‚Äôs a mess of a Saturday.
Bill: I still wanna do a bnha meetup. I‚Äôve never been a part of a big meetup that I haven‚Äôt also been running.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Do it üôå
Bill: It‚Äôs mostly the timing with this one lol
Bill: What are you cosplaying Allison?
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Frappy
Bill: Nice!
Bill: ~~I‚Äôm glad we still don‚Äôt have anyone doing Uraraka~~
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Lol I was thinking about her but like I feel like so many people must cosplay her
Bill: Not really. Her suits weird, even without the memetastic vagina line.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Fair. I just recently got into the show so I've just heard that by season 3 she gets madly popular/best girl worthy so I was under the impression that everyone would cosplay her
Bill: Hmm... I mean, Tsuyu does the most actual work in the show?
Bill: Uraraka just kind exists to fawn over Deku by s3.
Bill: ~~The author gives all the women in the show nothing to do but~~
Nokri (Marisa): uraraka has the most cosplayers usually
Nokri (Marisa): the bnha meetup at anext two years ago had mostly uraraka <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): unless the girls were cosplaying guys
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Highest female cosplaying bnha charcater is probably todoroki anyways
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Somwhow
Bill: You are NOT wrong.
Bill: I think we meant of the female characters.
Bill: ~~still valid sometimes, genderbends~~
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Besides I really love froppy haha. So it works out üòä
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Froppy is a good gorl
Bill: Yeeee froppy good bean.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Also considered Momo. But that'll prob be a future goal
Bill: That‚Äôs An Outfit ‚Ñ¢
Nokri (Marisa): it took way too long to find this yikes
Nokri (Marisa): six uraraka
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the best one is the one taking th ephoto
Nokri (Marisa): look at the pompoms on the cheer one tho she's so good
Nokri (Marisa): i don't see swag bakugo dang it
they had one of those bling swag hats and rolled up in heelies they were obviously the coolest person there
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): awww love it haha
Andrew: I think I'm gonna sacrufice soldier for all might
Andrew: Since it seems people here are dressing for it
Bill: I couldddd... I was just going to cosplay rwby for rwby and the two shoots are back to back.
Andrew: Well mha is 2 hrs which is long
Andrew: I may switch halfway through
Bill: Mm but Hazel is my hair and Mirio wig will reck that.
Bill: I cosplay literally two things with large fandoms how‚Äôd they end up so close to one another.
Nokri (Marisa): Large fandoms are always around the same time because that‚Äôs when most people are doing them
Bill: Yeee sucks lol
Bill: Future god of beer and wings.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): -smashes kalahari cup- ANOTHA!!!!!!!!!!
Bill: Yeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): niceeee
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Looks good!
Bill: Can probably use that as is?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea looks good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): unless you want it to look MESSY like his
Bill: Now I just need a beard to match.
Bill: Oh true. Probably need to drive home the ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt showered since before the snap‚Äù look.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah work some gunk into it to get it matted and dready
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hair wax would be good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or pomade
Bill: I gots pomade.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): similar consistency
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): just like roll strands of hair around in your fingers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like youre making a playdoh hot dog
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but with hair
Bill: Think I get that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so fat Thor is basically just Aquaman with a gut
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://smile.amazon.com/Rubies-Mens-Batman-Superman-Justice/dp/B01COLACZK/ref=cts_ap_1_vtp
Bill: And go slowly.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Bill: ~~So just aqua man.~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://smile.amazon.com/Deluxe-Figther-Cosplay-Costume-Accessory/dp/B076N8FGM3/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=cosplay+beard&qid=1558544732&s=gateway&sr=8-5
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ayyyy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thatd work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's adhesive but you might still want to invest in some spirit gum
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and even still, facial hair is a bitch to stick to your face
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~thats also a damn good captain marvel wig and i might buy the same one~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): mostly mustaches because they sweat more and plus warm moist air from breathing through your nose
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): prosaide may be better?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): idk though
Bill: Yeee the latter one makes more sense.
Bill: I thought you were meming before no sending beard links lol
Bill: Ye will get spirit gum.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also that warm moist air of the Kalahari <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Jones boots are in too, so with wog from Leanna that‚Äôs done.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WOO
Bill: Which I feel like im going to get a lot of traction out of?
Bill: Cause it‚Äôs jeans and tee shirt?
Bill: Boots are also for Denki too. Which has an off chance of arriving the day before Next.
Bill: Thursday.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you gotta get one of those beards from o brother where art thou
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MCXJxTNKGwc/UgRq6cE8StI/AAAAAAAAFdQ/7uAivPV3Sys/s1600/obotherthoughareyou3.jpg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats an intense beard right there
Bill: Think that second one is enough of a color match?
Bill: ~~there's really only one way to find out I suppose~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): amazon be like that
Bill: you said prosaide instead of spirit gum Leanna?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mark recommended it for my catra mask because its supposed to stick better
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i never tried it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sO idk
Nokri (Marisa): Biru are you gonna use makeup? I think a bit of contouring would really tie hazel and Thor together
Aldus Larian (Jess): awww yeee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): agreed make up can achieve The Look
Bill: mmm... Haven't thought about it. I'm not going to look ideal no matter what I do, given weight (blah blah body type doesn't matter for cosplay, but it's not about gatekeeping it about looking 'like' da character), I have no disllusions I'm going to be some "Instagram Famous" cosplayer... And I don't think I need makeup to not look like 'the guy who joined the group without trying' when cosplaying with everyone so it's... not really something I care about?
Bill: Plus the further away from my face the better lol.
Bill: That said, I was partial to the idea of something under the eyes to look exhausted as Jessica.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): make up make up make up! üëè
Nokri (Marisa): Makeup looks bad up close, it helps for far away stuff
Nokri (Marisa): Your double negatives are confusing I‚Äôm not understanding your message entirely
Bill: I haven't thought about using make up before.

I don't think I have the face to be 'the character' already, and makeup can't change that. 

I don't think I'm going to be instagram famous so there's no reason to put in effort 'for my fans'.

And I think even without makeup I don't look out of place (bad, lacking effort, compared to group) when I'm with everyone else so that isn't a motivation either.
Bill: Clearer? I'm terrible at english lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dont think any of us put in extra effort for "our fans"
Bill: I'm not saying you do, saying it's a potential source of motivation that I don't feel like I have. >.>
Nokri (Marisa): But if you think you don‚Äôt have the face then makeup is exactly the thing to change that :0
That‚Äôs what makeup is for

I‚Äôm not saying you look bad without and I‚Äôm not saying you need makeup, just that it can add surprisingly a lot to a cosplay. We use a ton of it and yeah not for our fans (I don‚Äôt even have any fans) but because it makes us look better 

Thank for the clarification!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _make up changes your bone structure_
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea and it also boost your confidence in your cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): Like check out this girls contour
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Get some dark eyeshadow to bag under-eye bags. I invested in some for the same purpose when I did my "engineering student" costume in college <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): ~~no pressure though no one is forcing you to do something you don‚Äôt want to, we just lookin forward to ur cool cosplay~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE toms just uses a dark grey for under eye bags
Bill: Ye I know you ain't pressuring me Mawisa. It's a good question.
Bill: I don't think contouring can hide the fact I gots a double chin. Said extra chin actually obscures my bone structure entirely so... My jaw ends up looking like one round feature, rather than angled.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _cheekbones_
Bill: Which just is what it is, les the weight loss thing kicks in again.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _nose contour_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _browbone contour_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Nokri (Marisa): I don‚Äôt think you have a double chin but I hide my double chin with dark makeup around my face and keeping my head above a certain point
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow erik thats a fuckin mood
Bill: I feel good enough with the outfits being quality, so unless it's particularly relevant (jessica's eye bags, Hazel's beard) I don't think I care enough to do it.
Bill: That could change eventually tho.
Bill: ~~I know Jess won't want me to do V without blue eyebrows right?~~ üòõ <:pew:543202259085950996>
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Do what's best for you honestly
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok small rollback tho because it bothered me a smidgen
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont think anyone wears make up "for the fans"
Bill: \
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that mentality lends itself to thinking people wear make up for others and not themselves
Bill: 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah even the motivation part
Bill: It's sort of motivation that could compel *me*.
Bill: Not anyone else.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mmmmm ok bill im just saying it bothers me is all
Nokri (Marisa): You‚Äôve got more followers than me biru <:lenny:395307171539189760> if anything you‚Äôve got the fans
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~screenshotting your answer and reposting is PA and comes off a little mean~~
Dizzy: The douchebag-jar count is now 1!
Bill: !counter add douchebag-jar 1
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~u told us to call you out but i forget the command~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that
Bill: People wear make up for their own reasons. One of the reasons *I* would consider it is because I'm trying to measure up to a standard, which in the case of cosplay would be instagram.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Honestly people wear makeup because THEY want to and because it makes THEM feel good. People don't wear Makeup for others, but it's a valid option to choose not to wear makeup too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i know it wasnt meant to be offensive but its that type of mentality that people use to say that "girls only wear make up for guys"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i was like _oh no bill thats a slippery slope_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i know you dont mean it that way
Bill: But, I don't actually care about instagram nor do I have the following that would say 'huh you should fix your eyebrows'.
Bill: So it's moot to me.
Bill: No, I don't think anything like that then. If that alleviates your concern.
Bill: Anyway.
Bill: Mawisa: camera angles can totally change face shape. It's one of the reasons I insist people who think they look bad on camera should trust me and not avoid cameras entirely.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wont make u match your eyebrows igain i sowwy
Bill: It's one of those skills that differentiates a photographer from a person with an iphone.
Bill: LOL no I wasn't offended.
Bill: I was just teasing you.
Bill: You take your MM cosplay groups seriously, and because you do I'm all for it.
Nokri (Marisa): dang if I look bad on camera I must be atrocious irl
Bill: ~~That's an example of a standard I'd use makeup for, but instead of instagram it's cause I know Jess'll appreciate the effort~~
Bill: You never look bad on camera.
Nokri (Marisa): Always
Bill: You a *total* meme sometimes though.
Bill: But that's awesome too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i just find it really pulls it together when u have an obviously unnatural hair color
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/13010903/android/sticker.png;compress=true
Aldus Larian (Jess): and marisa u always look good
Bill: Yup! So if/when more mystic messups, I'm happy to do the thing again.
Bill: But if it was just me as V, it wouldn't matter so much.
Bill: Like that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and since i just so happened to have the exact color anyway
Bill: Ye!
Bill: so no apologies, my pleasure to oblige.
Bill: ~~just need to find a more attractive V now~~
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Don't degrade yourself please
Nokri (Marisa): Free country <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: My love for V makes it fun anyway, but I do feel weird cosplaying a super thin animu boi.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you cant tell marisa she cant insult herself and then do yourself <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Personal preference.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean i get the feel but negativity is no good
Nokri (Marisa): Also I think the emoji are glitched <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: :3c
Bill: Yup, glitched.
Bill: Fair, the strike out a dig at meself but the reasoning is just how it does.
Bill: Still glitched Mawisa? The screen hasn't started showing code has it? :3c
Bill: That'd be a total bug.
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: You should you know.
Bill: talk about RFA secrets whenever that happens.
Bill: For no particular reason.
Nokri (Marisa): wait wot <:huh:555585958146473984>
Bill: That's what Ray wants you to do, like, pry for secrets?
Bill: It's so weird.
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah he‚Äôs an intelligence operative
Bill: I asked Jumin why he was upset about something with V's Dad and it had secret in the reply and I gave Ray a heart.
Bill: I didn't mean to do that lol
Nokri (Marisa): Good
Bill: ~~I'm drowning in V hearts cause I know exactly what makes him happy cause I'd want MC to say such and such to me <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>~~
Bill: I got like 18 hearts one chat.
Nokri (Marisa): inb4 bad ending <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~it would not surprise me to know there's a V bad end based on loving him too much~~
Bill: he could get all creepy possessive and 'loving' ~~kinda like ray~~ but just become needy, dependent and controlling.
Nokri (Marisa): He‚Äôs already needy dependent and somewhat controlling :0
Nokri (Marisa): Why do you think he‚Äôs undercover in mint eye
Bill: LOL you right. I meant like, Jumin bad ending levels.
Bill: "I need your smile to live through the day, so get in this ~~locked room~~ cage in my ~~cult~~ penthouse and be my ~~pet cat~~ pet."
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ü§¢
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and thats why i didnt play jumins route
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was thinkin about it, cosplaying toga might be fun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but i feel like everyone does toga
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but i kinda wanna do that LED thing that that toga did at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): especially cause noah cause program them and ill live right next to the ~~cosplay studio~~ rutgers workshop next year
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo that would be neet
Aldus Larian (Jess): toga is v. popular but shed def be fun
Bill: <@!386874959009415170> So your show is at a firehouse, not a bar?
Bill: Do they uh. Serve booze.
Bill: ~~serve anything?~~
Nokri (Marisa): Serve a lifetime sentence
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im tryna find the pics of the toga with the glowing blood packs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!184437198865563648> Yes, there's food and drink. If it's the same as the charity gig we played a couple months ago it'll just be like cheap burgers and dogs. Nothing fancy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But yeah there's a bar
Bill: Nicu.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I FOUND HER
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://theinsta-stalker.com/share/BuUIB_CgIla

Nokri (Marisa): wow that looks so typically american
Nokri (Marisa): I can‚Äôt go to nezumicon I have a thing for work
Bill: NANIIII
Bill: This isn't a stupid thing they asked you for randomly is it?
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs all they do is ask stuff randomly <:pew:543202259085950996> 
Plus we need money
I can see if the training can be moved but idk
Bill: If you can't go I'll miss you the whole time but I understand needin the work.
Bill: ~~I'll just have to give you your 100 dollas at the party~~
Nokri (Marisa): Nah it‚Äôd be better without me
Bill: It. Will. Not. Be.
Bill: Seeing you was *literally* one of my top three motivations for going.
Nokri (Marisa): O sorry
But it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôd bring everyone down
Bill: How.
Bill: Were you going to jump on back koala style?
Bill: That'd be totally worth it.
Bill: Or are you going to bring me downtown.
Bill: *Whose going to arrest me for drinking Mawisa*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is that a wrestling move?
Bill: Probably?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Mars the cosplay wrestler pro
Bill: Uncle Yo will show up just to introduce her to the ring.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ‚ôê
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's.not Mars but it's the closest thing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That I can find
Aldus Larian (Jess): i miss mawisa
Bill: me too.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ‚è∫ ‚Üó
Nokri (Marisa): O I know uncle yo I‚Äôve had dinner with him a few times
Bill: SO FAMOOSE
Nokri (Marisa): Nope
Bill: You are friends with the reason I went to my first anime con!
Nokri (Marisa): He got concerned I didn‚Äôt eat my Chinese food once though and asked me about japan he‚Äôs nice on and off stage
Nokri (Marisa): Otakon was your first con????????
Nokri (Marisa): Oh wait
Nokri (Marisa): Friends with Andru?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): My first con is KOTORIIII
Nokri (Marisa): Friends with u. U the reason you went to your first con woah
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
Bill: No, friends with Uncle Yo lol.
Nokri (Marisa): O yeah Karl
Bill: When I went to New York Anime Festival in like, 8th grade, it was cause I saw one of his shows on youtube and loved it.
Nokri (Marisa): We‚Äôre not friends more like passing acquaintances
Nokri (Marisa): Unless I go up and talk to him and introduce myself he doesn‚Äôt remember who I am he‚Äôs friendlier with BoJo
Nokri (Marisa): They‚Äôre on immediate hug status
Bill: Probably cause you were young when you met and it's awk talking to younger people as a guy at a con.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Truee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He's like 40
Bill: Like Lulu and even Audrey put me on edge.
Nokri (Marisa): He has a great story about how his elementary aged niece/nephew brought him in to do anime stand up for show and tell and how awkward it was that all the kids loved him
Bill: wowz.
Bill: You gotta invite him to your party!
Nokri (Marisa): Naw he lives in New York City
Bill: I work in new york city lol
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah you shouldn‚Äôt come either it‚Äôs too far
Bill: Did you at least remember to invite @longcat?
Bill: He's longcat you can't forget him.
Nokri (Marisa): He busy
Bill: Shame, glad you invited him tho.
Nokri (Marisa): My armor is far from done but my hands are raw and blistered from working on it aaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no mawisa! take break
Nokri (Marisa): Nooo the cosplay calls me
