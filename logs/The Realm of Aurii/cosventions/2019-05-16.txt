Andrew: overexagerated shiny ugh
Andrew: they dont look good
Bill: At a minimum you got me with Mirio and I guess Kaminari.
Andrew: Electric Boy
Nokri (Marisa): I have uraraka/tsuyu
A bit of an odd combo though
Except Mirio and All Might
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôd be a good one
Bill: Nah any of the students with all might work.
Andrew: All might is it for me
Andrew: Ive been told All Might is my spirit animal
Bill: You smile at everything?
Andrew: Oh no a smile?
Andrew: What is that
Bill: You realize you have to smile the whole time you‚Äôre all might.
Bill: Or else you won‚Äôt be the symbol of peace.
Bill: You also have to announce your presence into every room with ‚ÄúI AM HERE‚Äù.
Bill: You MUST meme.
Andrew: ÁßÅ„ÅåÊù•„ÅüÔºÅ
Andrew: Im taking all might as a challenge
Andrew: get out there and show the power of a true herop
Bill: I can‚Äôt wait for the memes.
Andrew: Hes gonna be polar to Naofumi, whos super depresseed and snarky
Bill: I wanna know what everyone else is doin too. ~~if I order now there‚Äôs a chance Bakugo could get here by Next~~

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): andrew counts
Bill: I know I‚Äôm teasing lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Bill: It‚Äôs the chaos magnets we need to reign in.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): andrew youre more than welcome to join
Bill: If you can find a cool female to do. Though somehow we still don‚Äôt have captain marvel?
Bill: I figured she‚Äôd be gone after widow.
Nokri (Marisa): obama means family yes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): All I can think of for some Reason is that scene from highschool boys where they are playing table tennis and one of the dudes just says Obama
Bill: They were naming presidents lol
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's really specfic sorry lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeeee

Bill: Errr no, she‚Äôs Spider-Man.
Andrew: Who are you bill?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so running list is Captain Marvel, Nebula, Mantis, Hope/Wasp, Pepper, Okoye, Shuri, Valkyrie, hela
Bill: Gen promises to do a lot of cosplay and doesn‚Äôt. Chris doesn‚Äôt commit unless he‚Äôs actually doing it tho so they‚Äôll probably be in.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^ ye
Bill: I‚Äôm Jessica Jones cause I‚Äôm a drunk angry bitch.
Bill: With a camera.
Andrew: Valkyrie I like
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üëÄ üëÄ

Bill: Cosplayers: genderbend that shit
Andrew: Always liked valkyries and liked her in ragnarok
Bill: Plus you like armor.
Nokri (Marisa): has anyone ever cosplayed the x force
i want to see an x force cosplay group
Bill: You‚Äôll have Georgia to tag with, she‚Äôs Thor.
Bill: And we have hulk, so that‚Äôs the other character she interacted with the most?
Bill: So you‚Äôll definitely be meshed with the group.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and loki!
Bill: Got Loki too.
Bill: Or you just wear your all might suit and say your captain marvel, same difference really.
Bill: Lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): good point
Bill: Sounds like you got it thoo with Valkyrie.
Andrew: Love it
Andrew: This for ota?
Nokri (Marisa): katsuuu
Nokri (Marisa): i think there's a smaller group for ota? main avengers?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ota is whoever is ready
Andrew: Katsu gives me time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): katsu is the entire group
Andrew: Is a future goal
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so no rush
Andrew: 
Andrew: Just so you know I'm covered on fur
Nokri (Marisa): furry
Bill: *Jess you need to shoot with this cattttt*
Bill: Wow that's odd. Nezumi has a burlesque.
Bill: Most minor cons don't do 18+ events.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think one of the organizers was a burlesque person at some point  ~~if not still~~
Bill: That might be it.
Bill: So <@!141729881779077121> do we put you down as the Valkyrie? ~~We need a meme name for it tho~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh
Bill: snrk
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you beat me to it
Bill: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): valkyrie should just be  "i drink and i know things"
Bill: I'm partial to using something Val Kill Me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dfhdasklfhsd
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THATS GOOD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): USE tHAT
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its canon

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): wheres marisa to call the cops on you
Bill: I guess they don't *have* to be thotty names anymore.
Bill: But.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): did someone say...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: *I don't have Snow on the charts*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats fine
Bill: *I realize this but maybe I'll. Pretend not to*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she'll prob drop
Bill: Should I change the charts up to more about showing the subgroups than who is each character? IE, For Valkyrie The Revengers makes the most sense, but Hulk Thor and Loki are already listed under Avengers.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she already did by the looks of it?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): unless I'm just blind
Bill: Make the roster more for showing the potential shoot groups?
Bill: Yup.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea we can do that, that might be super helpful in the long run
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i was just using the channel to keep track of characters but doing possible shoot sub groups is a good idea
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she did?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't see her name in the members list anymore
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh LmAO
Bill: Mmkay. We'll keep it to groups of decent size/with titles, so not like "Hawkeye and Nat".
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, that will just have to be something those two figure out on their own if they want photos together
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she lasted a whole week
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üòÇ
Bill: It's not enough people for us to coordinate. They can handle it themselves.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im relieved
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ngl
Bill: who was with Iron man in Civil War?
Bill: ~~and Cap my memory is shit~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: We have two of Iron man and 5 of Cap lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh that's not complete and idk who the blonde chick is. bad image

Bill: They're already listed.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üòÇ
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): listen that kid was like ....he never did anything
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i was impressed with him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he was like a pothead kid who slept under his desk in class and never did any work
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and when i asked him to be cap he got realy excited and like put so much effort into it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): even if it wasnt great xD
Bill: Remember that crush on Leneah? I thiiiiink I went back to the fashion to say hi. Katy was your grade too.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i was a loser and i subject the entire school to my bad ideas
Bill: I just established my reasons for going that was far more loser tier.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean i wouldve done the same thing if i had a crush on someone
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so nah not really
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...but then again i did just call myself a huge loser so ..maybe we both are
Bill: ~~someone basically ghosting you~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof

Bill: Vaguely.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): me looking at old stuff: yikes
Nokri (Marisa): new avatar group when
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): me remembering that i forced many people to do these things with me : YIKES
Bill: Yo yours looks good. At least via the image, you could wear that to a con and still get stopped a bunch.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it needs so many repairs and upgrades
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but yea maybe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Bill: Like, I totally get looking back at old stuff and cringing, but your old stuff is STILL quality.
Bill: You'll have to go further back to earn that yikes.
Nokri (Marisa): We should make cosplay timelines
Bill: that would be so much work for you in particular lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like timeline of when we debuted different characters?
Nokri (Marisa): Not if I stick to >6 costumes that I made per year
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Mine would be 1.7 years long
Nokri (Marisa): A rich history
Bill: Mine would be the sad, short one.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): mine would technically be 5 years long with like very large gaps for the first 3.5 years
Nokri (Marisa): Could do all costumes ever
I‚Äôd stick to just non-Pok√©mon anime for me though otherwise that would be very messy
Bill: non pokemon?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I actually remember most of my halloween costumes growing up
Bill: Have you done that much pokemon?
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah as a kid
Bill: Aaaah
Nokri (Marisa): Pikachu and Charmander Halloween costumes, the only Pok√©mon cosplays I‚Äôve done for cons is Eevee and sun/moon trainer
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~what about the time i made a chobits dress and pretended it wasnt cosplay~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~is that cringe enough?~~
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs worthy
Bill: Not cringe at all.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~are we sure?~~
Nokri (Marisa): Total cringe I love it
Nokri (Marisa): OH but it cute!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "no this isnt cosplay"
Bill: It's a cute outfit, it fineeeeee
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "no this is just a dress..... that i came up with.... yea..."
Nokri (Marisa): I thought you had like the ears and wig and all too and were going ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt cosplay‚Äù
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pali: "are you sure this isnt ANIME???"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "no no its fine, its not. don't worry about it"
Bill: ~~the skirt length is pretty anime~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i wore safety shorts but ye~~ XD
Bill: But other than that you can get away with that outfit as normie.
Bill: *fancy* normie, but normie.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the fashion show was really just me realizing that i love attention LMAO rip
Bill: lol
Bill: totally understandable.
Nokri (Marisa): Most of my clothes for work were from costumes because the button up shirts for cosplay were nicer than the ones I owned. And then my work clothes became a cosplay.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg xD
Nokri (Marisa): Next fashion show when Leanna
we need it
Bill: *yes Leanna time to go back to High School*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hard pass, bill
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lets have an aurii fashion show

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YIkES HARD PaSS
Bill: *You don't want to watch Tom and Jess fall in Luuuuuve?*
Bill: ~~Jess hated anime back then tho~~

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no thats creepy let them kiss kiss fall in love in peace
Nokri (Marisa): Was that a double reference 
Beautiful
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was led to believe all anime that boys liked was hentai
Nokri (Marisa): Valid
Bill: Who reads Franken Fran again Mawisa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless it was on tv
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs a great science manga
Bill: I watched way more trash anime back then tho, to be fair.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaaa i mean every anime club i sat it on it was very high pitched voiced - all girl - anime
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt hate anime all together though
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~I read/watched death note ok~~
Bill: First year was Angel Beats... Year after that I think I showed Baka Test and Haruhi?
Bill: The last year was more of a toss up.
Nokri (Marisa): I made everyone sit through a kids educational anime while I worked on a project. They didn‚Äôt care because they always watched their own anime on the computers
Aldus Larian (Jess): and vampire knight oof
Nokri (Marisa): One anime per year? :0
Bill: First year the club started in spring, so there wasn't much time to watch anything.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i only went to it the frist year
Bill: We met like, once every other week? for a few hours, so we could only watch 2 or 3 episodes.
Nokri (Marisa): Wow our Brony club met more often
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean i stayed in the clasroom to "work on my portfolio"
Nokri (Marisa): Brony club lasted less than a year and yeah during the first meeting the president almost accidentally put on porn
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH NO
Bill: It went for 4 dude and Meghan Maffetone to 20 girls and 5 dudes.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WHat
Bill: I don't even.
Bill: I still don't get that lol
Bill: Blew my mind back in the day.
Nokri (Marisa): He had the MLP episodes on a flash drive where he also kept his porn I guess
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh my god
Bill: ~~at the time I didn't have female friends let alone know girls into weeb shit~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik):

Aldus Larian (Jess): music artist, music artist , music artist,  soda
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I went through a phase
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I made a really neat Gibson Les Paul out of cardboard
Bill: *is that soda?*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was a lazy cosplay. I made a soda can top out of a pie tin and wore a Dr. Pepper t-shirt
Bill: Yeah the pun didn't make it through rip.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I was so tall no one could really see what I was wearing on my head
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): a weird hat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Slash was awful because I couldn't afford a wig and the top hat I made was too small and was squeezing my head
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had a bad habit of doing very specific and obscure characters for costumes
Bill: Is that so Taiyang Xiao Long?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if it makes you happy thats all that matters
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no one knew who I was when I did Zaphod and kids just called me a druggie üòÇ
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Bill: ~~is that really wrong~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the third arm threw some people off
Nokri (Marisa): did you have two heads?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I did movie version so one visible head
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but when I went out that night, my mom drew a face on my neck
Nokri (Marisa): **neckface**
Nokri (Marisa): pictures of me are so cursed

Bill: KAWAII
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): a cryptid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik):

Bill: Probably should have put it in general but.
Bill: ~~my server~~
Bill: Or I can come up with some self depreciating comment about eating heads.
Bill: Though it'd be a challenge.
Aldus Larian (Jess): that scared the shit outta me XD
Nokri (Marisa): looks like 2014-2015 is when i started doing lots more cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): ie. more than one new costume per con
Bill: you weren't born sewing?
Nokri (Marisa): or maybe that's when i started doing photoshoots because i went from "0 evidence this costume existed" to "20 files found"
Bill: Oh speaking of.
Bill: *You're backing all your photos up right now right*
Nokri (Marisa): what year was ghibli halloween
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Bill: I don't think that word means what you think it means.
Nokri (Marisa): üñ® üêà
Nokri (Marisa): big jump in costumes from 2014 onwards rip

Bill: Mawisa I have painstakingly reviewed your cosplays. I hope you understand I have to be 100% honest.
Nokri (Marisa): Edea Lee from Bravely Default! There‚Äôs someone who goes to Magfest who cosplays the archer version of her who is fantastic
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): You wrote death wrong <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: Are you calling me an idiot.
Nokri (Marisa): No I‚Äôm saying you spelled death wrong
Bill: I didn't spell anything wrong.
Nokri (Marisa): Diana and Sweater are cute yeah
Bill: YOU.
Bill: ARE.
Bill: CUTE.
Bill: Bonus props to Ranma and Touhou though, cause they pro photos.
Bill: Nacy?
Bill: ```Nokri (Marisa): big jump in costumes from 2014 onwards rip
i did have more costumes from before then (like Hazuki and Shana and such) but pictures don't exist on the computer
Nokri (Marisa): talking abuot all made costumes, i wasn't considering anything bought
which now consists of like half my costumes because japan destroyed me
Nokri (Marisa): shana was 2010, hazuki was... 2010 or 2011 <:thinku:543194478614413318>  haruhi was 2011.
Nokri (Marisa): at least my makeup has improved a little tiny bit <:rip:369476083248267274>
```
Nokri (Marisa): Yooooooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üòÆ
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WOaH
Aldus Larian (Jess): all your costumes are legit
Nokri (Marisa): Ranma was a paid shoot, Reimu was a hall shot actually!
Bill: that's amazing quality then.
Bill: They captured how pretty you are!
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah I was spooked
No I didn‚Äôt have a wig and I didn‚Äôt know how to wear eyeliner or mascara back then so I didn‚Äôt
Bill: I didn't say your makeup was pretty, I said *you were*.

But am not
Bill: Are too
Aldus Larian (Jess): you did white raven üòÆ
Aldus Larian (Jess): double raven double raven
Bill: Putting aside making sure you know you're beautiful, I totally see the improvement though. I think dogtier jade is the place I notice it first.
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!! Is why I keep pushing for rainbow ravens
Bill: wait you handmade the clannad uniform?
Nokri (Marisa): Ya, she‚Äôs one of the first I got wigs for, because that wig was for Feferi (the pic two before jade) that I didn‚Äôt get until after the con

Bill: It's not her, but it's not because it's too good.
Nokri (Marisa): Artemiavenus? I think is her handle
Nokri (Marisa): So good
Bill: You cuter.
Nokri (Marisa): Am scarier
Bill: Are not.
Nokri (Marisa): My distant stare causes seizures and ghosts to be summoned
