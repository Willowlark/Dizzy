Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@351471675843411978> <@334090409389195266> Any interest in checking out the silent disco at Firefly?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Idk any of the artists but it always looked kind of neat to check out in case there's a gap between bands we want to see
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa what is that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Kind of like a rave, but everyone's wearing headphones listening to the DJs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so to the outside, it's "silent"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but if you're wearing the headphones, it's a party
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh that sounds cool!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea why not!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Always interested in trying new stuff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, the print-at-home tickets should be sent in the days leading up to the event. I had to check because I wasn't sure if they were supposed to have been sent with the order confirmation or not lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Teeths!
Andrew: nice!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): toof
Andrew: Hey <@!245270932602486784> do you have any tips for running a photoshoot? All i have right now is a callist is there anything else i can work on right now to prepare
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i would have a little segment in the first 5 mins to establish rules!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): telling people cosplay is not consent, that they dont have to go up for pics if they dont want to, being mindful of possible con foot traffic, etc
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i would plan what kinda rules you wanna lay down beforehand
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): establish the designated shooting area and make sure people waiting aren't clogging up the area so other con-goers can pass through ☝
Andrew: All good points
Aldus Larian (Jess): Demand blood sacrifice
Andrew: Thats for the Heroes gacha summon circle
Andrew: like we did last year
Andrew: 
Andrew: Whens a good time to get a location cuz i dont know where others are atm
Aldus Larian (Jess): That looks like a party
Andrew: It was
Andrew:
