Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😂 what's his deal?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): IKR
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): it’s really funny seeing BNE reject them all day
Bill: It’s very hard to try and be friends with someone you were in love with. I can’t imagine this is easy for him, so take that into account, if you want to be friends. Otherwise set the boundary that you aren’t friends anymore.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He dumped me over the phone billiam
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And then said to never talk to him again
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I don’t want to be friends lol
Bill: Then don’t play league with him, chat outside of BNE. To me that feels mixed.
Bill: Don’t give him the ground to think you want to be friends. (Not trying to say you did anything wrong, just my opinion on how to deal with him)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t want to be friends, I’m fine with acquaintances
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He’s just trumping around with Meg too which doesn’t help cause she’s all passive aggressive towards me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): They’ve been attached at the hip all day
Bill: She needs to take a chill pill, she and you don’t need to have a problem.
Bill: Hal’s the idiot here.

Bill: Hunters softbox lights are nice I *guessssss*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🙄
Bill: It’s a simple setup, just having the gear. Everything else just happen. Not flash syncs, nothing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Idk what that mean but ok
Bill: They’re just lights you plug in. That’s it. Very easy, all you gotta do is turn em on and use them as the only lights.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm assuming flash sync is when the lights turn on only when the flash goes iff
Bill: Yup.
Bill: That’s the complicated stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye I use those at work sometimes the ones he has not the sync ones
Bill: I guess to me.
Bill: ~~steal then for Katsu~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Um no lmao they weren't too expensive tho
Bill: These are more my style than flashes though, which is an interesting observation.
Bill: I mean borrow.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that's not gonna happen 😂
Bill: Mm. These I could consider getting.
Bill: It’s exactly how he shoots Casey’s boudoir.
Bill: ~~inexpensive my ass, lighting equipment 500~1500 bucks~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Do a shoot with like 20 dollar store flashlights, cling wrap, and some used bedsheets to reflect the light
Bill: This is actually a thing people do though.
Bill: Still, I really hate flashes so maybe continous light sources would be a good investment.
Bill: It's way more my 'style'.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> I only did one photo of you at Geekdom so I'm not putting up a gallery.
Bill: I dun't even know what galleries have made it to instagram anymore. I stopped going in order awhile back.
Bill: I haven't been shooting normal things much recently and I'm out of things to do my every other pattern with.
Bill: I've got vacation photos, but that's not going to give me much.
Bill: I gotta start doing more photas.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Do more photos!!
Bill: shit you right.
Bill: I need a cat to take photos of. I'd totally be that guy who posts dozens of pictures of his cat.
