Bill: https://imgur.com/a/tBz5I So Mikakunin has this slide show in the OP of various stills... A lot of them are great references. Particular the two where Kobeni doesn't have a top on, for boudoir.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sooo all those spots biru marked for Photoshoota and stuff got saved on my app and now when in open maps and zoom out it's just
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh I figured out how to turn it off, good
N🆗ri (Marisa): Katarina’s outfit is such a mess I might give up for Katsu. I’m very frustrated.
Bill: !!!
Bill: But you were so hype!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah I love her and I really want to more than any other costume. But I’m dumb.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve made like three skirts and they all suck and they’ve wasted a lot of fabric. They come out wonky because I don’t have a table and what I think is a straight cut or line winds up curvy.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭 you're not dumb your being stunted by haveing no room to work! That's not your fault ♥️
N🆗ri (Marisa): They said I could use the table at jack’s during the sewing lessons but they grossly over exaggerated how big the tables are. I can’t disrupt the students to take over half the workspace to trace something out that’s messed up. 
I dunno. I’ll see if I can salvage this but everything I’ve made so far is awful so I might quit for now <:rip:369476083248267274>
