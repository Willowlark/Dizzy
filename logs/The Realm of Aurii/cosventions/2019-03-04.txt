Bill: Wait so is it 10 or 11?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): website says 10
Bill: Oof.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): she sent in an entry request so she may have a designated time
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ?
Bill: Iâ€™d really rather finish that shoot before RWBY, cause after RWBY I want to be able to chat and hang out.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): tell her you only have that time then
Bill: Ye. Judging is what, 10 minutes?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): usually ye
Bill: So maybe Georgia and I can do Yang stuff in that general time frame and whenever Flora does end up free Iâ€™ll do her part.
Bill: Or are you starting to lock out time <@!245270932602486784> ?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You said 11 Friday and Saturday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I blocked those off, did you wanna switch?
Bill: TLDR Flora will be free at some point in 10-1. If you arenâ€™t booking yourself up, I could shoot you in that time frame, breaking to shoot Flora when she free.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Uhmmmmm I probably would be shooting around that 11-12 block because rebecca wanted to shoot in the morning and so did Erik
Bill: With that extra time you might be able to grab one of our Blakeâ€™s or something for bees, groups.
Bill: Lol you already did.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰
Bill: Leave it as is then.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 11-12 still good then?
Bill: Ye.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): friday is still good too?
Bill: Wasnâ€™t sure how busy you were making yourself.
Bill: Ye both are fine.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): saturday is a relatively busy morning and early afternoon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but saturday afternoon, friday, and sunday are chill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): bill you wanted to shoot lux too?
Bill: Mm... that was the straddling the golden hour shoot that would run up till chiliâ€™s remember?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): RIGHT i just never updaetd my doc cause i was in class
Bill: Some stuff before sundown, standard fair, and after dark do some lightwriting via the staff. Which is. Experimenting.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 5:30-7?
Bill: 6:30 to 8.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): gotchu
Bill: Sunset is 7:20.
Bill: I guess my plan is to just. Hang out and shoot whatever people come up with.
Bill: Feels like a terrible idea but also yolo.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): me: wow i have so much to do
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'll have a room on the 6th floor at zenkai lets hope you guys do too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): also me: what if i bought the todo wig and split a dress down the middle for formal
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO 6TH FLOOR PARTY
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): not too crazy because all of staff is assigned 6th floor rooms :3c
Bill: I could request it....
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): would also be easier to walk down to the con floor instead of walking down 10 floors
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tru....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it was nice having 3rd floor at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): also here is zenki schedule

Bill: <@!334090409389195266> https://www.amazon.com/Action-Camera-Sports-Built-Lens-Black/dp/B01CW4EYIK?ascsubtag=06dbe88126ae776ba54afe50f569803000283682&kinja_price=80&kinja_promocode=VY5FUXE7&tag=kinjadeals-20 ever hear of these?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nope but im gonna look for reviews on youtube >.>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): zenkai is looking like its gonna be pretty relaxed for me, no real shoots planned or anything, so i might go around and try getting some cosplay footage to make a CMV with my gimbol
Bill: You can borrow my go pro for that too if you want.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i might actually if thats ok
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i really wanna test out an actual gopro before i pull the trigger on getting one myself
Bill: ~~you can tell me what itâ€™s like~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): absolutely xD
Bill: Iâ€™m probably only going to use it at CCE cause o want to be drunk in the water not guarding my camera.
Bill: Does that make buying it a mistake? You decide!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yo I also have a very laid back schedule for Zenkai... might buy that 360 camera
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait never mind
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Usually ships in 1 to 2 months*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OOF
Bill: Hello fellow laid back people. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm quickly realizing ozma isnt getting close to done for zenkai, i want too much detail in it to rush it. Sooooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): prob just doing my comfy cosplays + penny for the rwby shoot
Bill: Nice.
Bill: Iâ€™m kinda hoping I can just. Socialize and shoot while doing so.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^ yea i hope you can too, i think you'll have a better time
Bill: ~~the theme of my life is pipe dreams~~
Bill: But Zenkai the place to take the risk. We congregated all con in that corner last year.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd like to not do that this year
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im with you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like it was nice for a bit but that was literally the con
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): with the exception of leaving for RWBY shoots, personal shoots, food, or the formal
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): to be fair, there's not much to see unless you go to panels
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that was... convenient for seeing everyone but not con-like
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom and i kept taking "walk breaks" and just wandered the con
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): some people go to the con just to larp all weekend you could try larping
Aldus Larian (Jess): honestly i like wandering cuz more people ask for pics or give you compliments
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm sure there's a dealer's hall and artist's alley but like, I honestly don't remember going to them last year
Bill: Walking is fine, cause wandering to spots to take photos would be part of doing photos. I just want to be around people.
Bill: Being alone at a con is *depressing*.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i work the dealers hall/artist ally <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> pls come visit
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ~~has gone to cons alone for 10 years <:lenny:395307171539189760>~~
Bill: ~~you'll soon know the suffering of having friends and wanting to be with them~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i feel like the social dynamic of cons has changed for the worse though over 10 years
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): it's getting more... normalized? mainstream? which isn't bad it's good more people are going to cons but it doesn't feel like a big family anymore
Bill: Maybe it's cause you were big into homestuck, but haven't joined any kind of new fandom?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): no i'm talking about long before homestuck too
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'm in like every fandom
Bill: But not *really*.
Bill: You dive into every fandom.
Bill: But then dive back out to go to the next.
Bill: You've never like, just conned in RWBY.
Bill: I'm not saying you should, but being that involved in the fandom group is what started BNE which is one of the key things to my enjoyment of cons.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i have my feet in all the pools. i have many feet.
because a con is like 4 days long and I only have 4 rwby costumes
Bill: RWBYs fandom is unique like that.
Bill: 
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i think the thing is i don't like fanon, i'm a very canon type of person and I feel like a lot of fans warp a character's personality
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): so i don't read fanfic and stuff
Bill: Maybe in certain fandoms? If anyone else is big into Fanfic in BNE they don't talk about it.
Bill: Meg has her... opinions... on Kiribaku, but that's an outlier.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i go meetups and i run them, i chat about fan stuff online with people occasionally. i'd consider that being in a fandom
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~alot of people read fan fic but it has stigma so people dont talk about it alot~~
Bill: *judge me I've read at least half the recommendations on the RWBY tvtropes fanfic page*
Aldus Larian (Jess): you are def still in fandom though u like art and comics and stuff like that
Aldus Larian (Jess): you just have alot of fandoms
Bill: Yeah, I don't mean you a Fake Fan.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'll read something if it has a major impact on the fandom, like Cupcakes or Dipper Goes to Taco Bell or that harry potter one, but i tend to shy away from it otherwise. which feels really bad because one year my Akatsuki no Yona secret santa gave me a fanfiction when I requested no fanfic and it was long and I'm sure it was wonderful but I was so conflicted
Bill: It's like... I was(?) the Rwby photographer guy for a bit because I was at the shoots and talking to to people and making friends just in that fandom. That helped make me a part(?) of the fandom.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooh nooo they must have missed that D: pr maybe they dont draw or anything else
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i do about 5-6 fandom secret santas a year for different fandoms they fun
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah ;A; at least other people enjoyed it because we post stuff publicly!! but it was like 20 pages long aaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~ill read your yona fic for u~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH DAMN
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill still give it a shot
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i gotta find it, it was at least 3 or 4 years ago hhhhhh
my secret santa 2/3 years ago was buri and it was amazing she drew this huge comic and then gave it to me in person when she came to tokyo
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo dont worry about then!
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOA thats amazing
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): **i will find**
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): what the fudge is there a virus on my tumblr page there's like a comcast pop-up on it
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): can someone with a good antivirus please go on my blog and tell me if you get an XFinity pop up
http://princessvanellopevonschweetz.tumblr.com/
Aldus Larian (Jess): no pop up
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): :0
that's weird it must be for me
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): because i do have an old outdated whatever it is
but
it's only ever showing up on my blog and no other websites
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): thank u that's really freaky
Aldus Larian (Jess): are they your ISP?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats prob eh
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): they're only reaching out to me through my tumblr blog <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO
Bill: @everyone watch social media for Katsu room block announcement please and thank.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): They said towards the end of March but ye they could be sneky
