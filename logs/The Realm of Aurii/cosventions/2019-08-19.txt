Nokri (Marisa): i wanna start advertising for colossalcon since people have started asking me already but i haven't finished otakon yet [immensely sweating emoji]
Nokri (Marisa): my therapist also angrily told me to raise my prices but. hnnngh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): raise üëè your üëè prices üëè
Nokri (Marisa): i spend 5-10 minutes editing every picture, and otakon shoots have returned between 26 and 61 pictures per shoot so far. i spend a few hours every day editing but i only charge money for the time at the con. 

i feel really bad about raising the prices, but time spent editing photos is also time not working in the office hnngh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): let *clap: your friends üëè pay üëè you üëè
Nokri (Marisa): NOOOO
Nokri (Marisa): NEVER
Nokri (Marisa): i still owe some of you from otakona retrshtdjkfj
Nokri (Marisa): when you guys reverse stole from me. that's illegal
Nokri (Marisa): aww sam is booking for otakon. i wish i knew, not that i can afford her at $50 for 4 pictures
Nokri (Marisa): i'm looking at the prices now and they seem to be way above what i'm charging, but if I charge too much people won't wanna book me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what are you at now?
Nokri (Marisa): $15 for a half hour with as many pictures returned as possible
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): plz charge more
Nokri (Marisa): like the album i just finished was a half hour and she got 34 pictures back
Nokri (Marisa): what would ny'all say is a reasonable price? like one you would look at and say "that's a good price" for the awful stuff i offer
Nokri (Marisa): i'd rather not charge at all but bills
Nokri (Marisa): i got my template ready
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd say $30 for what you return would honestly be incredibly reasonable. Even though it's a pretty steep hike from your current $30 :grimmace:
Nokri (Marisa): THAT'S SO MUCH
that's what most people are charging for like 4-5 pictures though........ but i'd feel so bad
Nokri (Marisa): i need a magic 8 ball
Nokri (Marisa): i already promised anna $15 for her and $5 if she brings mag, i think that's good for them
and y'all are free
maybe bne and people i've worked with before get the $15 while newcomers get $30? but then it'd be hard to advertise. i could just put "discount for those who've worked with me before!"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's reasonable for what you return, but you might have to gradually work your way up. Like add $5 each con, so like CCE would be $20
Nokri (Marisa): hmmmmyeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): $20 would be convenient for people because they could just tap a $20 from an atm
Nokri (Marisa): and i won't put a promised return date because otakon has hundreds of pictures
Nokri (Marisa): i'm already a week late with 2 shoots
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's just like, an easy bill to work with and you wouldn't have to worry about change
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you could also add optional expedite fees if they want their photos within a certain timeframe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): even if it's like, an extra $5
Nokri (Marisa): that's a good idea but i don't think it's possible, i only haven't been editing photos when it's all i've been doing all day. any free time i have has been on photos and then i play games to take a break from that
Nokri (Marisa): i don't mind sending previews/a particular image early since that'll just take 5-10 minutes to do tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): fair
Nokri (Marisa): some photos require a lot more work though, like with madoka i'm going to have to recreate her skirt for some images and that'll probably take like 20-30 minutes
Nokri (Marisa): cce proooobably won't have stuff that intensive though? maybe
Nokri (Marisa): like in this one i'm gonna have to edit out her shorts and add in the skirt where needed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Nokri (Marisa): we need the floof!! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think the 5 dollar hike every con is reasonable!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And 20 is good for CCE
Nokri (Marisa): but so expense
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Your time is precious, and your labor is worth way more than 20
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I understand your hesitation to charge
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also like Erik said, 20 is convenient for people cause then they just have a 20 dollar bill
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i wonder if i'm even allowed to do photoshoots
i didn't get the photographer badge because it didn't seem worth the extra $10? all it really seems i can do with it is have one lightstand (which i don't use anyway) and advertise on facebook
Nokri (Marisa): they're not very clear at all on what's included with it aside from

-The photographer pass grants you 3-day badge access to the convention.

-Once you have paid for your pass, you may make 1 post in our cosplay facebook group to advertise.

-You will be listed on our photographer directory on the website which will be occasionally promoted on facebook.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you're probably better off advertising via Instagram
Nokri (Marisa): yeah and tumblr and twitter
i just don't wanna get to the con and they ban me for not having a pass, but there's no statement saying you need a photographer pass to take pictures?
Nokri (Marisa): "Anyone is welcome to take photos at the convention,
but if you intend to charge people and cosplayers for
photoshoots, then for their protection, we require
you to purchase a photographer‚Äòs pass. The purpose
of the application process is to verify your service as
legitimate, not to judge quality of work."
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think so. Rebecca brought her camera to take photos last year and I doubt she got a photog badge
Nokri (Marisa): oo did they offer them last year?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh RIP...
Nokri (Marisa): i recognize most of the people on the list hehe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I guess it's a liability thing since it's kind of a smaller and more confined space, plus swimsuits
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you could just be a dude taking pics of girls in bikinis to look at ||and wank to|| later
Nokri (Marisa): they miiiiiiight have had it last year? i can find one post about it

" Photographer Pass: I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll say it again, there is no significant bonus in purchasing a photographer pass at this event at all. Per the website, the additional permissions (from a regular badge) involve making one post in the official group to advertise your shooting rates, and being listed on their website (your name as a hyperlink to your work among a sea of other photog names). So for an additional $10, it‚Äôs a decision that is a no-brainer. There is no enforcement of badge type at con to prevent non-registered photogs from bringing their own lighting gear and adhering to the rules"
Nokri (Marisa): and there's not really a way they can 100% check if you're charging for photos, right? maybe you're just taking pictures of friends? and what if you buy a badge physically at the convention, how can they add your link to their website?
Nokri (Marisa): did you guys think the staff were really picky/uptight about photography?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don‚Äôt observe them being particularly picky
Aldus Larian (Jess): I never noticed anything
Nokri (Marisa): hmmmmkay. mmaybe if i just do enough to cover badge and part of hotel costs. and pray i don't get sent to con jail.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~except Sunday, but that was uninformed Kalihari staff brought in from a bunch of Karens complaining~~
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): i was at least under the impression that the photographers badge granted you acess to the water park for cheaper? ü§î
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): maybe not tho
Nokri (Marisa): ooo? they didn't list that on their site, but i didn't read the kalahari rules that were linked so maybe that says it
Bill: They didn‚Äôt care when I had my camera either.
Bill: CCE is lazy as hell with their photography coordination, despite all the stuff they have on the website for it.
Bill: If anything don‚Äôt advertise on their group. You‚Äôll be fine then.
Bill: Also raise your prices slowly if it‚Äôs a hard concept. 10 dollars a con.
Bill: If Rebecca can do 30 you certainly can.
Bill: ~~hell if Hunter can do 30 you can~~
Bill: Not to mention Hunter and Rebecca both bumped up to 45.
Bill: Also while I understand you wanna do friend shoots free, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with accepting payment. We know you‚Äôll make good use of the money to you know, eat, so it‚Äôll be a comfort to us to know we‚Äôre not taking up time you could be using for a paid shoot.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so strictlycosplay made that initial post about BNHA/Star Wars mashup and I was like OwO and then we got talking about it and that's what spawned his poll about it so I might be doing Jedi Kiri for Katsu now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what day were we planning GB MCU? Saturday morning? <@!334090409389195266>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea sat morning
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): y e e t
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): okie, just wanna make sure in case this actually happens
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When‚Äôs Jedi BNHA üëÄ
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no plans yet. he's gathering interest
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I'm already looking at lightsabers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): >checks saberforge.com
>"oh $75, that's not too bad"
>"oh that's with no electronics"
>basic electronics +$99
>oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I'd still buy it though tbh~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wanna get on of their more plain looking hilts and then customize it for Kirishima
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I want gear looking things
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and a grip made out of Croc material
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo my friend has one of those
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sith Toga.... mmmmmmm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yoooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd probably doing a Sith design for Kiri just because of color scheme
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Even though he is the furthest thing from a Sith
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think I‚Äôm doing my hero on Friday so
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If Friday ends up being the day, I‚Äôm all over that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Would be a cool afternoon thing, as it gets dark you can really see the sabers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEAH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~id have to rearrange my schedule but I‚Äôd do it~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://saberforge.com/collections/apprentice-sabers/products/forsaken
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like the pommel (bottom end) of this one because it already has that gear look to it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooooo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The aesthetic of my hero being all colorful really lends well to this AU üëÄ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BRUH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like the idea of them having lightsaber colors that match their color schemes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Todoroki either needs to dual wield red/white sabers or have a double bladed one with red/white blades
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _my boi_
Bill: Han-aroki.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Saturday night I could also maybe do it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _cursed Katsucon why do you have to be so planning intense that I have plans half a year in advance already_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't have anything planned except Gender Bengers
Bill: Which is... pretty much everyone's only plan.
Bill: I know I wanna run around and meme fire emblem.
Nokri (Marisa): wasn't fire emblem also a plan ye
Bill: But that's only relevant to Andrew and Marisa.
Bill: ~~unless Jess wants to Teach up~~
Nokri (Marisa): finn is gonna be fem byleth at katsu and possibly anna
Bill: Ye!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): might GB V7 Blake? We'll see
Bill: Erik: "Leather bodysuit sign me tf up"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm doing RWBY/My Hero on Friday, Genderbengers/League of Legends Saturday, and Scott Pilgrim Sunday <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): would like to do new things but really don't want to do as much as last year
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *whoa, Wezrez is veering away from RWBY*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Huehuehue
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly I feel like everyone is
Bill: Depends on what happens with volume 7 if the veering sticks.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôve done so many things on my RWBY bucket list ya know
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): even Casey "IRL Ruby" Sanders has been putting more effort in her monster cosplays, which, honestly, good for her
Bill: But if any con is RWBY heavy it's Zenkai.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah
Nokri (Marisa): oh i've been veering towards it since so many of y'all cosplay it whoops rip
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Still waiting on that Jaune cosplay üëÄ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But yeah Katsu we see people from far away so I like coordinating with a larger range
Nokri (Marisa): i've only rwby cosplayed with you guys at konkon <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: You a great blake Mawisa!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH SHIT THAT'S RIGHT I WAS GONNA DO JAUNE
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao whoops
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe I'll do that instead of Blake
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Blek
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I said I‚Äôm making yang
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I know me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm gonna fuckin cave and wear Pyrrha
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MORE UPGRADES
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll hold off until we see JNR's new designs
Bill: And if you do that, you'll probably skip League yet again to do something easier and more fun.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *prays he still wears the hoodie*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bitch better
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Imagine like he cuts the sleeves off
Nokri (Marisa): would anybody like to rwby cosplay with me at some point
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Something stupidly edgy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ME ME ME
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): üôã
Nokri (Marisa): i have 4 characters that's gotta match somethin right
would you? <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> [starry eyed emoji because *o* just makes stuff bold)
Nokri (Marisa): or italics
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes plz
Bill: Which some point. "veering away" only means one day of RWBY rather than two.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have Weiss, Yang, Pyrrha so that coordinates with basically everyone somehow
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): would love to do Taiyang/Ruby stuff if you do Ruby at all again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HAVE WE DONE BEES MARISA?
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH i've got ruby blake pyrrha and neon WE HAVEN'T
Nokri (Marisa): konkon is the only time i've ever done rwby with people here
Bill: Don't worry Marisa there'll be plenty of RWBY still.
Bill: You know what they say about addicts.
Nokri (Marisa): withdrawal symptoms can cause immense pain and death
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO
Nokri (Marisa): and the shakes
Nokri (Marisa): and then after rwby we do homestuck right
Nokri (Marisa): everybody now
Nokri (Marisa): if every cosplayer in this server joins in we'll have enough for 9 trolls it's perfect
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i still own 6 scalemates_
Nokri (Marisa): i have a bunch too **we can make a pile and have a trial**
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i have pyralspite, senator lemonsnout, inspector berrybreath, duke pinesnort, and I forgot the other two_
Nokri (Marisa): ooo i don't have any canon ones i just have whatever random colors of fleece i had at the time, they can be the ones that get murdered
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O wait wait

Bill: I just knew I'd be doing Claude.
Bill: But hella yeah Bernie.
Bill: ~~implying I'm not debating bringing Claude to CCE~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!301927856240459777> üëÄ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why he 55 dollar now damn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They were 35 originally
Nokri (Marisa): collector's item
rare

Bill: Make your own, Marisa more than talented for it.
Bill: What am I doing at CCE.
Bill: Jumin?
Bill: Uh?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _what the fuck_
Nokri (Marisa): they really easy to make i'd make them in between classes at rowan
Nokri (Marisa): but *official merchandise*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I didn‚Äôt realize we love fine stopped selling them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What a trip down memory lane
Nokri (Marisa): AAAAAAAAAA THER WAS AN OFFIIAL BOOTH A
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): HOOW PERFECT
Bill: AAAAAHHHHH
Bill: Yours is better tho. :3
Nokri (Marisa): THEY'RE THE CANON COSPLAYERS FOR THE OFFICIAL BOOTH THEY'RE FABULOUS
Bill: No u!
Nokri (Marisa): when i wear her again i'm just gonna use a cheap hoop skirt and real gloves, that'll look much better than the junk i was sewing in the hotel room
Nokri (Marisa): most of the faults came from everything being 100% hand made, so now that i don't need to worry about that anymore it'll look better
Bill: And how quickly you put it together.
Nokri (Marisa): when will i be good at cosplay
Bill: You already are.

You will improve at cosplay construction when you better estimate the time required to make things up to your high standards. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): NOW <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): that's why i'm giving bernie a loong time
i'm ready to be a decent cosplayer how do i do that
Bill: You're beyond decent.
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Bill: I'm one of those people who just buys stuff so...
Nokri (Marisa): and i'm sewing it together 30 minutes before leaving for the con
Nokri (Marisa): sewing it in the car to the con
Nokri (Marisa): sewing it at the con <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: hence more time <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: üëÄ
Bill: Ezcosplay will actually take commissioned cosplays
Nokri (Marisa): i'm trying to find my favorite cosplay picture and i passed the rika picture and i was like "a/z/??? who is this in my downloads folder" it freaked me out
Bill: When concept art of Barbarossa comes out...
Bill: I could get a quote.
Nokri (Marisa): how do i go from the disaster on the left to the goddess on the right teach me your ways
Nokri (Marisa): the armor is what's gonna drive up the price
Nokri (Marisa): fabric parts are super simple
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Nokri (Marisa): how'd you do that so quickly
Nokri (Marisa): evil
Nokri (Marisa): how do i become the goddess there
Bill: You are the goddess there.
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Bill: He's really only got a pauldron in Barbarossa.
Bill: and #stupidanimeboots
Nokri (Marisa): I KNOW THOSE COSPLAYERS
Nokri (Marisa): THEY'RE THE CANON WOTAKOI GUYS
Nokri (Marisa): i've only spoke with them a handful of times and they're too famous to follow me but maybe if i like and reblog all their stuff senpais will notice me and like my katarina pic
Nokri (Marisa): I don‚Äôt know who you are but I love you
Aldus Larian (Jess): what dey says?
Nokri (Marisa): "A very lovely Katarina-chan desu ne"
Nokri (Marisa): the plot of that book is so amazing i can't wait for the anime
i would die for katarina
Nokri (Marisa): and the manga is about to end in a couple of chapters aaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): YAY!
Nokri (Marisa): i should really read the physical novels i have, i wonder if they're any different from the online version
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: Remembered theres a unit inspector if you zoom all the way in on the map.
Bill: It'd be mad expensive probably but if you know, stop. buying cosplays till Katsu, I could see doing it. Then I'm timeskip capable too.
Andrew: Were you doing pre or post?
Bill: I ordered pretimeskip already.
Bill: If I do post, which I want to, it would be Barbarossa.
Bill: Just have to do as a custom commission and I'd like to wait to see if there's any official art coming out for it to use as reference over screen shots.
Bill: post ain't happening till Katsu at the earliest.
Aldus Larian (Jess): id start with just the one for now, make sure you enjoy cosplaying the character first
Bill: Also that.
Andrew: Are you doidng Claude for CCE?
Bill: It should be here before then. I think.
Andrew: Cuz i definitely wont be done by then
Bill: No worries.
Bill: Could also shinanigans a casual/swimsuit outfit.
Bill: Should ship anytime now, actually.
Andrew: ~im gonna procrastinate and completely miss the hype window~
Bill: But Jess has point cause Claude ain't a bulky boi and I can feel weird about the non bulky character cosplays. ~~not to mention lots of people will cosplay him and they'll all look better so that'll suck~~
Bill: Nah fam, the next con people have to really unveil content at is Katsu.
Bill: CCE isn't a big new cosplay con/
Nokri (Marisa): People care more about the detail and work you put into a costume than weight
Bill: I know what you're trying to say, but I technically buy cosplay so... ={
Bill: I'mma troop through the... discomfort? I wouldn't call it fear? that feeling, no worries.
Nokri (Marisa): A lot of a cosplay is the details when putting it on in the morning
Nokri (Marisa): Like I was wondering why the other Marisa at Otakon was wearing blue contacts when madoka has pink/brown eyes but it was a detail she paid a lot of attention to to make her costume pop
Bill: That's a good point.
Bill: <@!334090409389195266> Sam and Ryan are totally fine with you coming along on the 7th to the NY renn faire.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): :ooooo ayyyyeee woo!!!
