Bill: https://petapixel.com/2019/02/21/pro-vs-amateur-photographer-using-both-a-30-and-7200-camera/

They're trying to prove that skill is more important than gear but. The cheap camera photos *are* worse than the pro one.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Does that go for all levels of camera?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like is a 7K one that much worse than a 10K
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Or does it top off at some point
Bill: Mmm... I'd say it's more like there's a handful of classes. Often used is point and shoot as it's own category, and they all get lumped together, while dslrs are lumped together... But it goes more granular than that. I know Nikon's, the XXXX series are the amateur, entry level, the XXX series are mid grade, enthusiast, and the X series are pro.
Bill: They went to the complete opposite ends of the spectrum in the video.
Bill: ~~I didn't know you could get a non hello kitty camera for 30 bucks~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): are they talking about like technical quality or like artistic expression?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont have sound on lol
Bill: quality in general. Don't get me wrong, skill is important and more valuable than just gear. I just think they screwed themselves using *such* a large gap in gear because no matter what you do, a 30 dollar camera is going to have issues compared to a 7k camera.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh yea. you can use the cameras limitation yo your advantage, like the black and white one, makes it look like 1980
Bill: Right and if the pros did that in the video I'd be like 'yes see, skill made the camera better' but they didn't, they just shot a similar photo to the amateur.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): What’s Zenkai hotel looking like again?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Who in it and cost?
Bill: Tom, Jess, Georgia, Justin, Rayna, Leanna, Erik, Kurtis, me. 10 people, two room is 950ish. There's a poll in that group chat.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): theres a poll? 😮
Bill: for who was going.
Bill: course Justin and Rayna are marked wrong.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hoe old is the poll?
Bill: I started the chat a month ago? You already replied.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i know i was just wondering how far i have to scroll up to see it
Bill: Georgia voted in it, so it should pop to the front.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nvm georgia bumped it down
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hoorah
Bill: Aaron is skipping, John has said nothing so as far as I'm concerned he's out.
Bill: Mawisa is in the staff block.
Bill: Dave doesn't do Zenkai, too small for him.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats only 9 peeps
Bill: oops. 9.
Bill: wait. there are 8 going on the poll and then add justin and rayna.
Bill: OOP forgot Andrew.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So 95 per person
Bill: something like that? Haven't checked the chart myself.
Bill: Justin and Rayna aren't doing thursday, that'll play a small part.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Do we wanna invite more peeps or are we good?
Bill: I'm personally good.
Bill: Zenkai is cheap enough I'm not worried about the cost for people and while I enjoyed some of Katsu I'd like to rock with the good friends.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea 95 is cheap
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my likey
Bill: I'm already more hype for Zenkai than Katsu.
Bill: I don't have a single shoot yet either.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yet lmao
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Any idea how bees will work
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I meant beds but that typo is funny lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): idk what im doing yet
Bill: Haven't thought about it yet.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): bees always work
Bill: Especially with Leanna around.
Bill: Yeah, I know I'll shoot room friends but I'm not in a rush since people don't book solid like Katsu and I'm still thinking about what Jess said earlier in the week, what do I want from photography.
Bill: I do want to know if boudoir is going to happen this time around. I may ask in the room chat, so I can kinda make it known to Erik and Leanna I'm trying to setup for doing that. ~~it'd be awkward to suggest directly but Leanna at least has brought up Sonic boudoir how many times~~
Bill: But first I just want to unpack. My poor room is a mess.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my whole house is a mess
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The NASA camp is good without boudoir
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): My lineups lookin like Starfire, RWBY, and something idk
Bill: I wasn't thinking you would change your mind post Katsu lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 👉😎👉
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im really not feeling rwby but other peeps want me to do it
Bill: It's a toss up if that Hazel will get here before Zenkai, unfortunately.
Bill: Same for Barry.
Bill: Was thinking about trying to make an RE group shoot...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): where did u order it from?
Bill: ezcosplay. Cause of chinese new year they didn't start them till basically now though.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Oof
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk if I want V4 Weiss with red scarf or V1 Yang and attempt to remake jacket to my liking
Bill: Try to remake jacket, if it bombs do scarf.
Bill: 
Bill: Anyone have an opinion on cpac?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): too close to being shipped away to physicsland to have an opinion :/
Bill: Assume you aren’t going away that weekend.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): eh too shitty to wanna go
Bill: Zeikani has asked me if I was.
Bill: If there’s something else planned I could drop, but I didn’t hate it enough to skip overall.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): when is it?
Bill: Last weekend in April.
Bill: 26-28.
Bill: Kogaracon is two weeks before that, which is one day and free.
Bill: Oh and Sakura Sunday was the Sunday after kogara...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: If we’re doing kogara and Sakura Sunday maybe cpac is worth a skip.
Bill: Kogara is a cute campus for photos, unlike cpac. There’s like, nothing at kogara cept a cosplay contest and “cosplay bazaar” but no charge so who cares.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I gotta skip kogara cause april has physics GREs and caseys welcome back party (ugh)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so i have to work that saturday
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): sakura sunday should be good tho 👍
Bill: Mmkay, but also still tell Ethan to fuck off.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~I’m holding out for the maid of honor title for caseys sake~~
Bill: ~~what so you can kidnap her during the bachelorette party~~
Bill: I'm hard pressed to believe Leanna would even want to attempt it so...
Bill: ~~Ethan~~ Casey will have to choose another.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): in im for mission kidnap casey
Bill: Kogara I wouldn't do without a group (will put it out to BNE too) going, but I'm definitely doing Sakura Sunday to go see Andrew and Marisa.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> <@!301927856240459777> so make sure you actually go to sakura sunday. (Kogara too, that'd be cool)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): kogara is where?
Bill: some college within 20 minutes of Georgia's place.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): meato
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _meato_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): <@!301927856240459777> do you work ALL day Sunday
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Of Zenkai
Bill: Yeah. It's like... Derpycon without the dealers room, but pretty campus.
Andrew: I mean I'm going to Sunday. Would a gone last year if it wasnt in a storm

Bill: It’s disgusting.
Bill: Fuck staffing a con man.
Bill: I pay to go to these things.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Truuu
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): People be answering my poll like “wear Weiss on Sunday!” And it’s like my dudes that’s too much effort
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~Yona~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Marisa can you cosplay from Yona under the staff clothes 👀👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yes 👀 yes I can 👀
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Mmmm Tristan just messaged me that he got off for Zenkai
