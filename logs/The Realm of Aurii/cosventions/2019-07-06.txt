Nokri (Marisa): i finally figure out what the stars mean on archive
apparently, if someone likes your picture, they can add it to their list (like a bookmark?)
and then when something is on their list, they can add a star rating to it from 1 to 5, so that when they sort their bookmarks it shows up in order of the stars. but for some reason the person who uploaded the image can see when they're starred? which is kind of pointless? i think it'd be better to see when we're added to a list/bookmarked rather than starred
Nokri (Marisa): so like. the star count is in the circled column. but 3 stars could be one person who gave 3 stars, or 3 people who gave 1 star. if i click on something with 5 stars it could be one 5 star, a 2 star and a 3 star, or 5 one stars. it's really really weird and i don't know if this counts towards anything.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Japanese cosplay site.
Nokri (Marisa): yee, cosp.jp!
i'm not even sure how to star other people's things. i guess it has to be added to your list of favorites first? because there's no option to star something under the image itself
Nokri (Marisa): i just logged in for the first time in a year and the last image i uploaded got 7 stars and i was like "cool! what...... what is that."
Nokri (Marisa): it got 2 one stars and 1 five star? ???
Nokri (Marisa): here's a whole page with the number of stars compared to how many times the images have been viewed in total
so i guess they count for something? but idk what and i want to know how to give others stars
Nokri (Marisa): OH i know her!! lol. scrolling through the recent uploads when suddenly, yuka appears. she's super sweet.
Nokri (Marisa): the first 3 pictures
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo a fren!
Nokri (Marisa): ye!! i did a few photoshoots of her, i think this aikatsu costume is her first "cosplay" cosplay. she would come to cosplay events before, but usually as a generic maid or alice in wonderland, like without a wig or contacts or makeup or such. it seems now she's branching into anime cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): she's literal baby. i think she just started high school aaaaaaaaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh a baby fren!
