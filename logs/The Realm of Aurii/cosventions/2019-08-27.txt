Nokri (Marisa): never heard of him
Nokri (Marisa): He‚Äôs friends with Sean though
Bill: I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs OC guy. üò¨
Bill: Casey (Sanders) is, according to her story, doing a ‚Äúboudoir like‚Äù shoot next month. Which of course, isn‚Äôt a problem, but I was impressed how long she held out with a patreon minus boudoir.
Bill: She has a 50 dollar tier, holy crap.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Looks like it involved bathbombs
Bill: She stole your idea. Or technically Georgia's. Or technically whoever Georgia got it from on instagram.
Bill: If you do want to try that, I'd volunteer my tub. Is whiteish (the beige tile kinda tints it) but all my light gear is here to make use of.
Nokri (Marisa): Bath photo shoots have been around for decades
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it wasn't either of our ideas
Bill: ,... not the point.
Nokri (Marisa): and before photography there were paintings! <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: ....
Bill: so.
Bill: Whose's going to cosplay Flayn and Seteth in a mcdonalds playplace.
Bill: Because.
Bill: I mean, obviously.
Nokri (Marisa): there's a rule that they're for ages 12 and under, unless you know someone who runs a mcdonalds with a play place it might be out of the question
Nokri (Marisa): gotta find another similar looking playground somewhere
Bill: sssh
Bill: We just didn't know.
Bill: I think I said at some point Erik would make a great Seteth.
Andrew: Ohh angles
Andrew: Im thinking like a black spandex suit for underneath?
Bill: A zentai suit might be a good base?
Bill: That's a lot of armor mate.
Bill: wat am I cosplaying for CCE.
Nokri (Marisa): everything
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Same
Bill: I could do the long coat for Hazel over swimsuit, no shirt and that's I guess? Beach hazel? Do I care enough? Do I try and make something as obscure as pilot boi beach versioned?
Bill: Then Jumin I said, and I'm absolutely bringing Claude, and I can probably be 'swimsuit claude' by doing the uniform longcoat and a black swimsuit and that'll be recognizable.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!301927856240459777>  and <@&390214086878560256>  are we still doing code geass? OwO
Aldus Larian (Jess): opps
Aldus Larian (Jess): there we go sorry bout that
Bill: aww I thought you remembered I said I'd do Suzaku. üòõ
Nokri (Marisa): ahh i'm not sure i'm sorry ;A; I've thought about it a lot but I don't think I'll be able to make a swimsuit in time, I might not even be able to do Jaehee. I'm really sorry ;A;
you two should go ahead and do it though!!!
Nokri (Marisa): why do anime have to have such specific swimsuits
Aldus Larian (Jess): its ok! i sent u that one from zaful that was pretty cheap i thought wold work
Nokri (Marisa): yee and then i forgot to order it <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): me too lol
Nokri (Marisa): i'm going to go commit sudoku
Nokri (Marisa): OH ok phew i was so worried you had purchased it and were all ready to go
Aldus Larian (Jess): which is kinda why im asking cuz if u and tom are out then i wont bother
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i actually have this swimsuit but i think it's a bit small~~
Nokri (Marisa): some day this could be us. just two gals gorging themselves on dessert pizza on a bed: the photoshoot
Aldus Larian (Jess): PLEASE
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I would like to but I don't have any ideas for swimsuits
Bill: male swimsuits are not recognizable really.
Bill: So you'd be doing it to look good next to Jess.
Bill: I bought that wig for Fat Thor too. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing to relishing in being fat tho. It's gone back and forth.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's how I want to go. Death by sudoku
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wasnt to get a new wig for MC, need to fins a bathing suit i can alter for Tom too only think i know for sure we are doing is MM ahhh
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Yeahh
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): How would one go about making a giant boar head ü§î ü§î ü§î
Aldus Larian (Jess): for CCE? maybe for katsu CCE would be a rush
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): go out into the wild and hunt an actual boar, then take it to a taxidermist
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://smile.amazon.com/micrkrowen-Halloween-Emulation-Latex-Terror/dp/B07F1PJC4M/ref=pd_sbs_193_2/144-5607244-2146906?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07F1PJC4M&pd_rd_r=868631fd-d6d6-44a5-a44a-4d79315ac24a&pd_rd_w=hChU7&pd_rd_wg=eiecO&pf_rd_p=43281256-7633-49c8-b909-7ffd7d8cb21e&pf_rd_r=KJ2G1410AQZ7ETHENFQJ&psc=1&refRID=KJ2G1410AQZ7ETHENFQJ
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats terrifying
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): this one's worse

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This needs to be a new reaction image for something
Kaio Vermino (Lee): My reaction to snow every time she speaks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): AOof
Bill: So I have to ask, shoots at CCE.
Bill: I'm fine with playing it by ear I suppose, cause I want to be drinking and hanging out as much as everyone else, but if that doesn't work for your mentality/schedule or you're going to feel awkward in the moment asking 'hey can do a shoot of this', lets here what you want to get shot. 

I always get weirdly weird making sure I shoot everyone cause *too many reasons* so I figure this is as straight forward as it gets? ~~I'm a drama queen I'm sorry~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think MM is the only thing I really care about getting a decent amount of photos because group cosplays
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea we gotta find someone for that <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Bill: Zeikani is at CCE butttt.... I except she'll be drunk early and stay that way. üòÖ
Bill: There's... greenscreenmanifesto, Joe.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know any photogs sept the ones here lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): and Rebecca/hunter
Bill: Could ask one of them....
Bill: I gotta learn to clone myself.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whos bringing a selfie stick?
Bill: I'm not sure if that irony or not.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): When are tall doing MM
Aldus Larian (Jess): saturday after like 3 i think? was that is?
Bill: After RWBY on Saturday.
Bill: Which is 2-3.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I could potentially try to help with photos if you want. I cant promise they will be phenomenal though xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im thinking one of these 2 wiggies for MC?

https://www.epiccosplay.com/collections/brown-wigs/products/nyx-light-brown-straight-long-cosplay-wig
Bill: I like the first one.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I also like the first one. The second one you'd need to do some major trimming on the bangs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): plus first one is cheaper! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): And more manageable!
Andrew: Im probably going to have to simplify the armor like I did with Lobster
Andrew: <@!184437198865563648>
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I'm gonna go sleep at cce at like 12:30 latest
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I ain't getting a damn migraine again <:f_respect:575713016297947157>
Bill: I'd pick Georgia's brain on armor smithing though first Andrew.
Bill: That, or we can introduce you to Anna.
Bill: Who quoted making an iron man suit out of foam as a week's worth of work.
Bill: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12115545?adults=10&source_impression_id=p3_1566937015_QLIj2zwnHoIu65oy&s=VGVt-5uc
Bill: Oh the rate changes to 619 when you go out to October, when there's a free weekend. üòí
Nokri (Marisa): <@!141729881779077121> do you know how you're getting to colossalcon east? is there any chance i can bum a ride and pay you
Andrew: You know I was going to ask you the same. As of right now im able to drive so I can take us.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~screams~~ ok wew <:pwease:555585508819075112>
I would owe you my life if i could hitch a ride because our car definitely wouldn't be able to make it that far and we'd be pulling over every 15 minutes to refill it
Andrew: Refill gas?
Andrew: My car should be fine *knock on wood* it can get to Bills
Nokri (Marisa): nah, the radiator overheats and it leaks coolant
Andrew: Oh ok
Andrew: That makes sense.
Nokri (Marisa): so we'd be without air conditioning the entire time and constantly refilling it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): i already have most of a lineup i think. i gotta figure out when bnha is happening i keep forgetting
Nokri (Marisa): do i bring blake cat stuff
Bill: your underwear?
Nokri (Marisa): ye
Nokri (Marisa): basically a swimsuit if i just stay out of the water
Bill: if you want to? We'll be doing RWBY saturday morning if you want to wear it out, if you wanted boudoir I have to know to bring in the light stuff
Nokri (Marisa): i don't think there's really a reason to do single boudoir
Bill: Then there's no need for my lights, and bringing it is if you wanna be RWBY with us.
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> You know if Justin and Rayna are coming thursday or friday?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm not sure
Nokri (Marisa): do we know how the rooms'll be split up?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Biru just put it on the Facebook messenger
Bill: I think she means whose where.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): That would make sense
Nokri (Marisa): ye~
Bill: My current thinking is Me/Andrew, Tom/Jess, Allison/Nick; then Andrew/Erik, Lee/Marisa, and Justin/Rayna.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I promise I'll try not to talk in my sleep Marisa!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): üòÇ
Nokri (Marisa): OH same! If i do say anything it'll probably be about online shopping <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): we can just have a full sleep conversation
Kaio Vermino (Lee): EXCELLENT
Nokri (Marisa): a-are there two andrews
Nokri (Marisa): or is andrew sleeping in two places
Bill: That TOTALLY said Kurtis.
Aldus Larian (Jess): How are me and Marisa supposed to stay up till 2am watching mystic messenger crack?
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Frey voice "True."
Nokri (Marisa): i have to figure out if the whole genderbent bnha group is gonna be there, because georgia isn't but i forget what everyone else is doing oops

aside from that my plans are currently to bring swimsuit ruby, swimsuit rin, swimsuit mari, manaka, morgiana, and katara. i'll also bring iida (uniform/swimsuit) if everyone in the other group is bringing genderbends

OH we are, yehaw so i'll bring sukumizu iida too
Nokri (Marisa): i have mari's uniform too she can be thursday if i don't do swim
Bill: Oh right bnha. I was going to bring fatgums jacket and call that a cosplay.
Bill: Or I‚Äôll just be Claude.
