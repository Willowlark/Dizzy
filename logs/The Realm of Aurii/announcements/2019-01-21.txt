Bill: @everyone I've detailed the opening of Aurii Season 2.0 enough on my end. (of note, Afina is hosting the party that's been discussed, a spring festival. Ballroom kinda thing. Everyone should be in attendance for whatever reason). 

In order to start we'll need the updated character sheets. Broken record statement, I can help with that, all you need to do is ask. Also per usual, I'd like to set a date for character sheets to be done, and a date for start. I don't think the character sheets will take too much of your time, tbh, so I'd like to say two weeks (which is Feb 1st) for that. That said, Katsu is a thing for everyone involved. 

To push Aurii post Katsu would be another month without the game. Given how the interludes went, I'm a bit worried if we push that far what energy we have to reboot will be gone again. But I don't want to add pressure to Katsucrunching and I usually make a habit of respecting people's time. So I'm pushing this to the group as a whole. So,

2âƒ£ For two weeks, character sheets ready by the 1st;
4âƒ£ For a month, four weeks ending Katsu weekend. 

Also, if people aren't that interested in the game continuing, please communicate that. I'd rather not plan and write things for a game that won't happen, I'll redirect my efforts elsewhere. ðŸ˜… You can DM me if you prefer for that.
Bill: EDIT: rather than 4 weeks, it'll probably be 5 or 6 so there's some time post Katsu.
