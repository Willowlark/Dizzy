Bill: Follow up on the story line questions: give there is a major storyline to the game, which theme appeals most to you?

‚öîÔ∏è: fighting on the front lines of the war, going from battle to battle and mission to mission to defeat the other side. (Doesn‚Äôt mean you work for Eraia or Dreca, a third party can get involved)
üî™: indirectly doing missions for the war effort. Working as specialists, black ops, an independent unit tasked with important missions that the rank and file can‚Äôt handle. 
üîä: political intrigue, focused on the courts and nations. Probably serving as ambassador and rallying groups/nations together for war effort. 
üêâ: collecting the seven dragon balls or what have you either for the war effort or the war is a background piece to your adventure. Adventuring to different locations to find the doohickeys. 
üíÄ: discovering mysteries of the world. The secrets of magic, manaketes, or what befell Elbia are top contenders. (Again, this could be with the war as a background piece of as a driving force)
üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Some kind of great evil attacks, monsters appear, everything is chaos. 

You‚Äôre welcome to write in an idea (drop in ooc) and elaborate if you have preferences on how any of the above should be taken.
Bill: Survey notes:

**World and Characters**: No one wants to change genre/character/worlds. All good.
**Tone:**: Generally everyone thought we should be able 2 clicks lighter and softer. 
**Immersion**: world build is good but not perfect, which is to be expected, I'm not perfect. NPCs are a little more spread, for a variety of reasons. That's something I can focus more on.
**Player count**: Only one person thinks we need more people for the game. Desii is a toss up of opinions. I'll come back to her.
**Story Structure**: Everyone wants a mixed story, a major plotline and subplots. Fair warning, I think we'll have to lean heavily on a major plotline going forward, as subplots will takes months to finish given the way a PbP works. We're looking at Seasons, rather than one Epic story, though one person leaned epic.
**Preferences:** More player on player interaction. That's doable, but in your court folks. :V Boss combat proved more popular than regular combat, oddly enough. People want more politics and travel. More romance, racism, and war involvement as well. Player interaction and combat are the most important things to the group. 

to be continued...
Bill: **Post Length**: people either felt that posts were a good length or too long. I‚Äôm inclined to agree that the post lengths got crazy as time went on. This to me is both good and bad. Enthusiasm is great but if reading posts becomes a chore people don‚Äôt. At the very least I‚Äôd like to reduce the need for tons of detail in combat to get dice, hence looking at Fate. 
**Dice:** no one understands the dice stuff but me. That‚Äôs okay, I think, as long as the trust is there I‚Äôm not screwing you over. That seems to be there. You do feel dice are important though, rather than removing them all together. 
**asides**: good idea that got confusing. 
**rounds per week**: ironically, the majority is to do 3 posts a week. Ironic because half of you found the pacing to be fast.
Bill: **fond things**: popular moments are when characters get an occasional spot light, as opposed to a constant one. Also popular is working together towards a goal and fights that were interesting to write.  
**Worst**: the church was not popular, as was post length and timing due to the split tables. 
**Interesting bits**: people like to tell stories about their characters. One of you likes working with other players characters specifically. ‚ù§Ô∏è
**likes**: people genuinely like playing their characters, either by exploring the characters emotions or having them be cool in action. 
**wants**: more grey area npcs. That... did kind of fall off, and I really wanted to show the world in grey not black and white. Leveling up isn‚Äôt in Wushu, but is in fate. However we‚Äôve been fast and loose with character sheets, if you want to evolve your character you can. (Insert raichu shocked pikachu face) Eliran is written out, so that‚Äôs a non issue. More clarity with story arcs is something I want to add as well, so that‚Äôll be addressed.
