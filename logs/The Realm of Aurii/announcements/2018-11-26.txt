Bill: <@&358049600172589067> A summary of the arcs for Aurii Season Two. Will involve travel to every nation. Also included the 'back of the book' summary for 'The Mist'. 

```A mist, thick as the clouds in the sky, begins to form in Callora. It spreads gradually, and no one consumed by the mist ever leaves. At the first this is mere coincidence, but towns, castles, cites disappear into the mist as if they never existed. The mist never wavers, no matter the weather. It continues to encroach on Laera and those enjoying a night of festivities know not the horrors that await in the mist. The mist contains monsters and magic unheard of in the realm and it swiftly overpowers and kills those trapped in it, or melds them with itself. The mist continues to consume even after a lucky escape, and soon the entire world has to face it's overwhelming power, even if they don't immediately understand to be afraid.```
