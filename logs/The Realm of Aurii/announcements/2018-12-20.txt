Bill: WE HAVE A CAMPAIGN.
Bill: ```### Prologue

Winter has passed.

* **Wynne**: Wynne has continued to observe the mainland's nonsense. Heralds from Dreca arrived on their shores recently, who were immediately removed from Wynne soil. They make no declaration of hostility towards either side, but state their territories will be fiercely defended. 
* **Callora**: Callora has been fairly stable in international dealings. Meetings have been held Etrina recently about gathering military assets however, and Callorain nations have been more conservative about people of power traveling out of the Alliance. Rumors have been swirling Callora is prepping to enter the Dreca/Eraia conflict, but no one can guess on which side. Laera is holding an annual ball that helds in the coming of spring, and the guest list is a tad larger than usual. The King has invited an eclectic group of people in addition to usual faces, mages and scholars of all kinds. When asked, he informed that they are old friends of his from his days as a researcher over a king that he would like to see again. 
* **Eraia**: Eraia had a major military success over the winter; specialist infiltrated a Drecian camp in the Kissaelain territories, gathering information and eventually stealing a Wyvern. The wyvern was flown to the capital, a resounding success. Eraia has been studying the wyvern to learn more about the creatures and possible counter measures. National morale is up due to the mission, though many call for the immediate death of the psuedo dragon due to a relation to Lyarlel. ```
Bill: * **Theanovene**: Theanovene has continued to remain a neutral party in the Eraia/Dreca conflict. This has brought them into a delicate powder keg of situation with Drecian and Theanovene officials constantly arguing over Theanovene's loyalties. Theanovene has held it's ground so far, but everyone in the city is feeling the pressure from the warring nations to choose a side. 
* **Dreca**: When the Eraian mission to steal a Wyvern went off well, Drecian morale took a hit. The pressure on the front lines stagnated and Eraia was beginning to make headway before Dryn Wulfa publicly executed the Wyvern rider responsible for the loss. Dryn gave an empassioned speech about the weak links not representing the whole. The speech was inspirational, if a dark message. There is a stigma now to not be the weakest link, because the weakest link is seen not only as expendable, but should be expended for the good of the whole.
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> We're going to move into the collaborative story part of the rebooting as soon as the holidays calm down. I'm not explaining it again, it's written above. Once we've done that, I'll check if I need to change anything in my outline and we can get moving on the opening act for the new year.  Start thinking about how your character spent the winter in Aurii. 

My recommendation will be to write the first part of the winter arc for your character, post, then figure out who will cross into your story for a bit. Minimum two crosses, but I'll accept all three crosses.
Bill: @everyone Stragglers, now's the time to be involved in the game. New character sheets, new system, new story arcs. DM me or just start talking about it.
