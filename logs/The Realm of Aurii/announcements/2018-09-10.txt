Bill: Posting resumes tomorrow afternoon.
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> We're going back to full posting! That means **Monday, every afternoon** and **Thursday, afternoon or morning**. As soon as I sit down with Kurtis, Tikur will be joining the group! Eliran will, due to Hal's leave of absence, will be staying in the next town to heal up. 

*I am posting even if no one does.* I'm doing that to keep the world rolling around you, and pick up some pace again. Con season is over and we've got a game to play. (Hell, we're close to the 1 year anniversary!)
Bill: @everyone those not playing, now's a good time to get on board. If you want to, character creation is butt loads easier and there's excitement to be had coming up.
