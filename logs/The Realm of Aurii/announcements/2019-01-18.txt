Bill: <@&358049600172589067> There will no longer be interludes. Game to cold open in two weeks or post Katsu.
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> Actually I forgot we're supposed to be migrating to new character sheets; please do so soon; I'll give an exact start date for Aurii when I've got the GM side ready with a few weeks notice, character sheets will be required at game start.
