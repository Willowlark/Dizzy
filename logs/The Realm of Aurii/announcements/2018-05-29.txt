Bill: <@&358049600172589067> I intend to move everyone to a 'head table' when the merge itself happens. Table 1 is entering town in the early evening as table 2 is on dinner break from the monastery. Time to start talking your first encounter. I could bullshit a script for it, but planning collaboratively is a good way to set the tone going forward (we're all working together to tell a story, which means everyone needs to contribute to the direction of the story) and get ya'll hyped and shit. 

In other news, I need to give you all a blurb on the general plot lines there are to be run in Trisp. This is going to be spoilery, in interest of better collaboration between you all and me. That's coming as soon as my fingers aren't tired.

**Storyline 1: Enera**

**Hook:** Desii is looking for Enera, potenial so is Nokri/Eliran/Aldus. 

**Goal:** Find out why Enera is at the Monastery, and react to those reasons.

Enera is at the monastery, for reasons unknown. *They aren't good reasons either.* PCs (you guys) will need to ask about and connect with the right people, or stealth some information to figure out what those reasons are. I can reveal the reasons, but I'd like to try and keep them secret for suspense. 

**Storyline 2: Lego Reveal** *Otherwise known as Fucking Finally*

**Hook:** *They finally going to do it*

**Goal:** The character's story arcs will advance. 

**Scene 1:** Afina impresses Torin with her skill at light magic.

**Scene 2:** An encounter occurs where Elfriede has to defend Afina unarmed. Due to desperation, he goes ~~ghost~~ wolf and reveals himself to Afina.

**Scene 3:** Afina will need some non critical healing and turn to new friend Desii and rabid animal Nokri. 

The story arc itself is finished after the third scene, the fallout of the reveal is character story arcs and can be dealt with entirely by the PCs. These are the *key* scenes, not all the scenes, more can be added to make the story arc more interesting.
Bill: Breaking things down into scenes you'd like your characters to experience in the process of the story is a good starting point. If Aldus wants to watch from a treetop in the windows of the Cardinal's office, that is a starting point for a scene. From there we work together to add other characters in who want to be involved, and add some detail that Aldus can discover to inspire a new scene or reveal the mystery of Enera. Scenes can be anything you want, much like scenes of a play or movie, chapters of a manga, or so on and so forth. Anything interesting that adds something to the storyline in the end is a good scene. 

(Alternatively, a scene can advance a personal story arc. If Desii were to have a conversation with an NPC or Afina about combat magic and how Desii feels it's wrong, that advances Desii's personal story about her acceptance of combat magics. That's also a valid scene, because it adds to a different storyline.)
