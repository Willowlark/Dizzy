Bill: * Aspects 4 and 5 are optional in the new system

* Aspects are anything that's core to a concept, in this case character. Anything that, if you were to be around them, you would learn about them. It can be on the nose as a room having the aspect "on fire".
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2018/12/29/fate-accel-gameplay.html Gameplay rules, including the usage of Aspects and fate points to get bonus, how dice actions work, and how damage is resolved. Should be it from the game rules side. I want to note; just because there is a list of actions, doesn't mean you can only do those things. Especially in a RP focused game like this; I expect you to do whatever the hell you want and when I see a reason to roll dice, I'll use one of the actions that matches what you've decided to do.
