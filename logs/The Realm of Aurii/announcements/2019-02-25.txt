Bill: @everyone Welcome <@!386874959009415170> and <@!334090409389195266> who you pretty much already know. 

http://www.aurii.us/ Is the website I host all the game articles on. "Aurii Season 2 Character Creation" is the one you'll want to read first. The world guide gives you an idea of the world I wrote up that we've played in. http://www.aurii.us/aurii_library/world-guide.html As for what happened last "Season" I leave it up to everyone else to explain. 

General and shinanigans channels should make sense on sight, Mawisa quest is a game she was running that played as she writes, we make a choice, she writes with that choice. Simple, started in Aurii's hiatus. It (and Aurii) have ooc channels for discussion of the games.

Aurii has this announcements channel for GM things, Character-sheets, characters-legacy (old character sheets from Season 1), a channel for the dice bot and fanarts. When the game starts there'll be "Table" channels which are for the game itself.
Bill: I've also restored Aurii-chibi under the Gameplay category. This is approriately for short character skits, ala chibi episodes of RWBY because *lol everything is rwby*.
