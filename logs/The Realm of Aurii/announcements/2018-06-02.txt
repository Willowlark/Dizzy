Bill: <@&358049600172589067> So... I don't think I really need to post. You guys are all adding details to Trisp well, you're spending your posts in interactions with each other and the world around you, and there are no key NPCs to talk to as you do it. I'm quite happy to leave you to your own devices. Only thing is to keep order until everyone meets up, 
Table-1: Elfriede, Nokri, Aldus
Table-2: Desii, Afina, Eliran
follow that guideline.
