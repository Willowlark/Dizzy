Bill: <@&358049600172589067> in the last month or so, the game has taken on some new aspects. There's been the information gathering/mystery/political aspects of the Enera storyline, and a heavier emphasis on characters doing there own things and asiding for character development. Combat is on the backburner, since you're safe in town. I've also reduced the amount of NPC interaction as a whole, as everyone wanted to see more player interaction over NPC. 

I want to know how everyone is enjoying these changes. I can turn the dial up on directing the story again if the looser nature isn't working for you, or we continue riding at this pace. Now that we've gone both ways, I'd like you to think about which style is more engaging for you. Emoji polls to follow.

🆓 for Freeform, 'following the characters' like Trisp
Bill: **Non Combat Plotlines**
📚 if you enjoy the mystery solving aspect of the non combat objectives.
🎙 if you enjoy non combat based objectives (political troubles, social conflicts) but you'd rather them not involve mystery work
⚔ if you don't enjoy the non combat based objectives.
Bill: **Trisp Plot Speed**
We can probably start heading towards the climax of Trisp pretty soon, you've investigated things and the work is set for the reveal. That said, we can also take it slower, build more drama, and give everyone more time to bond in Trisp. In the latter case, we'll discuss some subplots like Afina's training to give everyone else some direction.

Bill: I'm going to hold off on posting till <@&358049600172589067> answer the above, entirely because depending on where we go from here we may rejoin at the head-table or stay on splits. I'm not sure where I'll be posting yet.
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> Everyone is on the head-table again. Compare notes, make a plan, (in character), and we'll move to some evening scenes.
