Bill: <@&358049600172589067> we are once again live with Aurii. For the time being, there is a guaranteed post from me once a week moving things along, most likely mondays. Depending on how things go, I may suggest adjustments to that but we'll deal with that as it comes. Asides are open as well, but those may be adjusted in time as well.

A reminder to ~~Georgia and Tom~~ all the old players; we are no longer using Wushu. Wushu was the reason you had to write lots of details to get dice. It is okay to only have a paragraph or two for a post, it is not a competition and you won't be rewarded for long posting. Write what feels natural, there's no need to over embellish. I don't think it'll be too hard to transition to a *wee* bit lighter posting, as we've been gone so long.
