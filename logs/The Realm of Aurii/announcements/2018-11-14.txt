Bill: **Mini Poll**

Do you like the 'adventuring' bits such as wandering through towns and wilderness that isn't directly related to your objective? Would you rather jump from location to location without the '
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> At this point I'mma confirm we're doing a timeskip. I'm debating if I want it to be a whole year, or maybe only 3~6 months, but it'll be enough time for everyone to split up and do their own thing for awhile. That is important, we're going to make use of that to help flesh out and mesh characters. 

The first is from Fate. You're going to start writing a story, in this case 'what has your character been up to in the timeskip'. It's not a long thing, and you only write the start. Next, another party member will add to your story, either writing how their character crossed paths with/helped your character/or hindered your character in what they were doing. You'll do this twice, so you cross paths with two other players during your time skip, then end your story/adventure. This will tell us what you've been doing during the timeskip, giving you new memories to have with other players and new content to bring to the party from your adventure alone.
Bill: An example could be (in super short form) 
* Desii escorts Enera home, and decides to stay in the town for awhile and help rebuild. 
- *Give to Jess*
* Aldus visits the town on his travels. He stays a few extra days to catch up with Desii and they bond over the misadventure of a few time periods ago. 
- *I take it back*
* Desii confessed her love for Aldo when he leaves, but he turns her down. Desii is sad. While trying to feel better, she decides she's going to fight her stalker mentor once and for all and returns home to do so.
- *Give to Mawisa* 
* Nokri is in Hylley and sees Desii go up to her master's tower. Desii starts fighting her mentor and Nokri accidentally helps him escape Desii while she was stealing stuff during the battle. Desii is furious at Nokri.
- *I take*
* Desii decides to loot her master's tower for useful material and ends up reading for months. She unknowingly became the new sage of Hylley, helping people via magical means far better than her master did. She is still torn up about Aldus and has a new found dislike of Drecans because of Nokri, and wonders if the front lines of the war would find her Drecans to fight and Aldus again.


The goal of this process is to give yourself new *NPC connections, player connections, location connections, abilities...* You can change a lot in the time skip. You should come out of it with some hanging threads, things we can pull on later to give you the spot light. In Desii's case, she's now the sage Hylley (a responsibility), hates dreca (NPC/fac
Bill: The goal of this process is to give yourself new *NPC connections, player connections, location connections, abilities...* You can change a lot in the time skip. You should come out of it with some hanging threads, things we can pull on later to give you the spot light. In Desii's case, she's now the sage Hylley (a responsibility), hates dreca (NPC/faction connection), loves Aldus (player connection), has new knowledge she got from the tower (abilities)... 

I hope by the end of this exercise you'll have a way to define your relationship with every other PC more than "Party Member". This may snowball into a second exercise, while I can detail later.
Bill: Start thinking about the kind of adventure your character might have had on their own. Until I do some world/war building I don't want to start the process yet, so just plan in your head. I'm here for any questions or ideas you want to explore, for new abilities or connections, etc. *Don't* start planning with the other players; I'm not sure I'll let you choose who you get crossed with if I don't have everyone cross everyone's path.
