Bill: Iiiii had some shit going on Thursday, so I dropped the ball. Post IS happening tomorrow.
Bill: Tikur will be found when you get to the ship and Kurto will be rejoining at that point.
Bill: Also <@&358049600172589067> , Desii, as a GMPC, will not be making decisions for the group. That is effectively playing by myself. She is to fall into a passive role, there for character interaction and combat assistance. Desii is not going to lead the party if y’all don’t do anything. It was never to be her character and I don’t need to play both sides of the round.
Bill: Posts! <@&358049600172589067> <@!350855105123319808> is back. The captain will be there thursday.
