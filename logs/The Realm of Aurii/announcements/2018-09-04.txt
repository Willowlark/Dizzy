Bill: Between CCE and everything else going on this week, the fact that we need to bring Tikur in (which requires me to actually figure out how), and the next post will be a big boi, I made the call to skip Monday (yesterday) as well as thursday (which I intended to skip from the start). We can start fresh post CCE.
