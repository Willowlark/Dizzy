Bill: Summarizing everything because *I* need one. <@&358049600172589067> 

1. There is no constant damage here, because there are no mooks. Damage is dealt by Morras only. 

2. To roll dice to reduce a side goal, you need to do action related to it. In this case, “talk Enera out of being shell shocked”, or protect Enera in some way. If you can make a case for you doing something related to it, you can point it out. 

3. Similarly you cannot damage Morras unless you actually attack him. 

4. Enera is on your side, since that seemed to be a confusion point. 

5. The status block starts a round, y’all need to roll for this past round (which we just did) before I can post the new status for the new round. 

6. The italic (stars) dice let me give you dice even when you aren’t strictly doing something to Morras (or a side goal). They’re only useful for defense. They will carry over if you don’t use them for defense so when you do aim for a goal/enemy, you can make use of them. HOWEVER, if you carry over you still can’t have more than 6 maximum. You can always earn 6 more by writing details, so there’s no reason to horde dice. 

Welcome back to combat. Phew.
