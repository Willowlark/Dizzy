Eliran (Halim): As Eliran had popped a squat outside the baths, sitting on a nearby bench, he thought of the request Desii had made of them, to find Enera. _I forgot to ask Afina about that last night_ Eliran thought, chiding himself. _I guess I'll need to head back tonight..._ He spotted Elfriede, now a clothed man, walk out of the baths _Or I could just talk to knight boy about it now._ He realized, wondering how to smooth over another awkward start to a conversation with Elfriede. From their first meeting, to the run in within the bath house, Eliran knew that asking the knight for help after a lowkey threat while nude would inevitably be an oddity. _And here I've always been one for social grace_. he shook his head. "Might as well just get it over with" he muttered to himself, "Sir Faun!" he called out, quickly standing and running over to catch the night before he got to far.
