Elfriede (Tom) ♍: They finally walked into their final destination. Elfriede sat down in the leather chair and was silent as Princess Tyndall and Cardinal Raive conversed for the first time. He knew this was an important meeting for the both of them. For it was a big step in Eraia’s history, while simultaneously being something that Afina has talked about since leaving. Needless to say a knight interrupting a cardinal to speak. He looked down to the table and began to fall into his mind, as he had a lot on his mind. Faun decided he was gonna stay a few days to make sure the princess got settled in, they could discuss a few important things, and say goodbye.

*”Cardinal if that would be alright.”*
As he came back to, he glanced over to Afina who was looking at him side eyed, expectantly. Elfriede wondered what was going through her head, but he realized he hadn’t heard much of the conversation. He wondered if something concerning was said and immediately started playing close attention. Most Cardinals and Bishops in Eraia that he had met were rather ritual, but never would say anything outside of their post… Elfriede at least trusted them to behave predictably. Maybe Afina just didn’t understand something cultural, but they would have a chance to discuss this later… among other things.
