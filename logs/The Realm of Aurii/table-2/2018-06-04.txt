Eliran (Halim): Eliran followed Afina through the monastery, listening to the girl go on and on. He rolled his eyes when she offered to teach Desii  _God help the soul who has Mrs "I believe in myself so it works" as a teacher_ he thought to himself. Afina was a good and close friend, but even Eliran had to admit she had a few glaring faults, racism being one of them. _Shes going to get a kick out of Aldus_

As they arrived at the Bishops office, Eliran quickly entered and delivered his letter. "All right we're all done here, let's get your emblem and head out." He said cheerily, having pocketed a good amount of Eraian coin. It wasn't like money was an issue for him, but having the coin of the country helps with bartering when you need to.

As they exited the building, Eliran looked at the slowly fading skyline, "Yes lets, if I remember correctly our companions should also be in the market, perhaps we could all eat together?" He offered in response to Afina's request to make haste. He looked forward to meeting the girls guard, Eraians had a tendency to be easily thrown off by many Theanovene traditions and customs, and it was always amusing to catch one off guard when possible. _Maybe I'll greet with with a jolly cheek peck as I thank him for protecting Afina  for so long..._ he thought to himself, _or maybe we can trade some good stories of her oddities_  Whatever the case, Eliran  knew it would be an interesting turn of events.
Dizzy: Desii is quiet through Afina's *introduction*, her eyes widening to the size of saucers and her eyelashes fluttering. Her thoughts race a mile a minute.

Dizzy: *Afina, no, Princess Tyndall must be incredibly accomplished to be called the Light of Laera! Laera is only a kingdom over from Hylley too, she garnered so much fame so close to home. If only I had heard about her before, I could have gone to Laera rather than Eraia! Well, then again, she's here right now so if I **had** gone there I'd have missed her completely. Still, she had a mentor there, though I am loathe to apprentice again, after Zaimar...*

Dizzy: "That's a wonderful offer Af-Princess Tyndall!" Desii says as Eliran steps into the bishop's office. "And I uh, apologize if I've offended you in anyway, I did not know of your status." Desii says sheepishly, stepping into a slight curtsey. While not a true skirt, she holds the side of her hip cape out to the sides to complete the image.

Dizzy: "I couldn't pull you from your duties here however. I'm sure many people here wish to speak and learn from you as the Light of Laera Princess. I came to the monastery expecting at most to read some of the tomes enshrined here, or potentially join a group lecture if one happened to be for beginners. I couldn't possibly commit to being under one's tutelage, not right now." Desii says. "I'd be happy to show you any of my skill with Anima magics, I have an intermediary knowledge of each element. If it may serve the Light of Laera, I'd be happy to spend time with you mi'lady." She says with a wide smile.

Dizzy: "Ah, yes, the directions Aldus received from the bath house owner lead towards the market district. With the size of Trisp, I'm sure we can't miss them." Desii says, following along Afina's brisk pace which Eliran matches with his longer legs. The shorter brunette has to walk a little faster than normal to keep pace. Leaving the monastery without speaking to a clergyman (asides from the one who asked if she need directions to the exit) was counter intuitive, but Desii wasn't about to force Eliran to split from his childhood friend.

Dizzy: She chuckles once to herself. It wouldn't be that hard of a choice, of course. While the whirlwind first day cemented a form of bond between her, Eliran, and Aldus (Desii still avoids thinking about the consequences of that night); it's been harder to bond with the men she's been traveling with. Oh what her mother would say if she knew that last part. Desii smiles at the thought. *Mom always wanted me to get out and play with the boys once and awhile.* she muses.

Dizzy: Desii looks anxiously between the back of Eliran and Afina's heads, waiting to hear the Princess's reply to Eliran's suggestion. The Hyllian loved the idea of spending more time with the Princess. How many times would a normal, peasant girl like herself get to dine with a Princess? One whose a mage as well? Desii bit her lip in excitement at the mere thought.
