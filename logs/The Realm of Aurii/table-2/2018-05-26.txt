Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Afina glances at Elfriede briefly before taking a seat in one of the armchairs. "Thank you for your hospitality, Cardinal Raive, Bishop Dean." She bows her head at each in turn. "It is an honor and a privilege to finally be amongst the most prominent light scholars in Aurii. Master Witella spared no details in telling me of your prestige in particular, Cardinal." 

Afina wanted to asked the Cardinal all the questions she could about light magic. _How did he manage to accomplish a light vortex? And a light shield emission big enough to shield a town? Were the stories true?_ The princess, however, suppressed her fervent curiosity. She smiled. "Truly, though the voyage has been long, I feel truly blessed to experience Eraia and its culture." The princess could almost hear Elfriede snickering at her already; She had complained to him enough times about Eraia that he must've known her statement to be false.

"I recall your letter mentioning that this visit is not formally for teaching purposes, but rather a cultural exchange. How might this be structured then? I'm most keen on reading the light magic books that are available here, as well as inquiring about your own personal experiences, Cardinal, if that would be alright."

Afina looked about the room, tense. She had spent so long trying to reach Trisp that to finally reach the monastery was disillusioning. Such a location also felt unfamiliar, especially after spending so many days and nights underneath the stars. As the Cardinal spoke, Afina looked over at Elfriede, hoping to read his thoughts from a glance alone. She felt uneasy in the new location; maybe Elfriede shared the same sentiment.
