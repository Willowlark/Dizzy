Eliran (Halim): ---
After a surprise run in with Elfriede, Eliran was unsure what to do with the rest of the day. He half considered waiting for the knight to come out and ask if it was possible to join him. In all honesty, it'd be awkward considering, but Eliran was at a loss without somewhere to train his bow, and knowing the Eraian's cultural view of music, he wouldn't really be able to play openly till much later and only in very specific places. _Well I could play a song praising Lylalel I guess_ he mused to himself, knowing full well how bored he'd have to be to do it. For now he pondered slightly outside the bathhouse, not sure of where to go.
