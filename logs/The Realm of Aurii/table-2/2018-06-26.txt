Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede did not sleep well that night, far too much time was spent staring at the ceiling, both reliving the tender moments from that night over and over, while also thinking about his sudden withdraw. The disappointment on her face was clear, his as well. 

After several long hours he finally he finally passed out and awoke late in the morning hours. Much later than Elfriede was used to. He slowly arose and sat looking down lethargically before finally rising and readying himself for the day. Once he had donned his armour he walked out and passed Afina’s door, finding it unsurprisingly empty.

Elfriede spent the last hours of the remaining morning patrolling around the perimeter of the monastery. It was a nice quiet walk that gave him the opportunity to consider everything on his mind. After several hours he took a break to bathe, somewhat out of necessity and somewhat out of boredom... and to get his mind off things.

Faun Entered Trisp’s bathhouse as he had done when they arrived in Trisp, changing into a bathing towel and paying the small fee for the caretaker to watch his belongings. He walked into the decorated bathroom, clad with religious symbols and candles and slowly submerged himself in the waters, trying to let them relax him. He looked around the waters, *Not very busy for this time of day…*, there were only a handful of others in the waters on the far side of the pool. Someone had also let small pink flower petals afloat on the water's surface. *Perhaps a foreigner? Or maybe someone thought it would be pleasing to the goddess.* Faun closed his eyes and sighed lightly. He would relax a moment before washing off.
Eliran (Halim): After getting in bed Eliran quietly waited for Aldus to leave, hoping it had ended the conversation. Not long after however,  he could here Aldus talking to somebody in the Hallway. _whatever_ Eliran thought, _my name needs a nap_.
That night, sleep came to him in a slow process, he hadn't drunken any alcohol, and frankly the harder he tried to go to sleep the harder it was. Thankfully after a while he drifted into midnights embrace.

The next morning Eliran was unsure of what to do, he was in no mood to see his companions, their questions about his identity would be bothersome, and he was positive Nokri would try to start mooching off of him as soon as she got the chance.  Seeing that it was getting to mid or late morning however, Eliran decided to stretch and get on with it, figuring the Market would be a good starting place, as Aldus and Nokri had already visited and probably wouldn't go back so soon. After a few hours bartering and working with the local venders, Eliran had started to earn a slightly sweaty appearance as he was still wearing his Theanovenian clothes, that were a little heavier than what the local Eraian fashion and weather warranted. Buying a new set from a clothing vendor, he made his way to the bathhouse, intent on cleaning off and taking a break before he changed into his new garb.

As the Theanovene switched to an appropriate bathing towel and entered the bath, he asked the caretaker if he could bring something in with him, and with a few lines about the rejuvenating effects and fair scent they'd produce, which would surely appease the goddess, he was allowed to bring in a mix of flower petals he had found fresh on the market. _A lucky buy considering they're almost out of season_ He had thought.
 Having let the petals spread through the entirety of the bath, Eliran settled into the bathwater letting out relaxed sigh, "sometimes it's good to be alone" he mused outloud to himself.
