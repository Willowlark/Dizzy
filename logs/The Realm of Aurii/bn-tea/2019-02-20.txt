Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): “Noah is like Windows 11. Very good, could use some improvements, but generally agreed to be the best. Tarik was Windows 10. Overhyped, unreliable, and keeps crashing. Hal is Windows 8. Looked good, but not stable, and wishes everyone didn’t leave it for Windows 11” ~ Tyler
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that's fucking dumb
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah it is!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Askin me to hold a party for him comin back and then not asking me to be maid of honor!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I wonder if Leanna’s told them anything yet
N🆗ri (Marisa): He asked you to hold the party?????? Why not hold it himself??? What
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s insane
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ☝️
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's still the rudest thing ever
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You can't ask someone to throw a party for you
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can *maybe* imagine “can you spread the word around” or “go to this place and reserve it and I’ll send you the money” if you’re super good friends 
But just. Throw him a party. What.
Bill: Tell him to fuck off?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): And on top of that it's not even a welcome home party cuz they are only visiting
N🆗ri (Marisa): My welcome home party from japan was helping my sister watch her kids and I was gonna say he could do that but actually I wouldn’t trust him with kids
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He's so full of himself
N🆗ri (Marisa): he reminds me of tom from parks and rec
Bill: He’s using you. You can let him if you want to.

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): /remembers ethan
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 😑
N🆗ri (Marisa): oof
don’t do that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Something about megs description on her most recent post seems weird to me
N🆗ri (Marisa): the franxx one?
Bill: She wasn’t very happy with the cosplay. Probably feels obligated to post about it as the coordinator but has little motivation to. That could explain the undertone.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't see anything wrong with it
Bill: You’d have to squint. All the capitals kinda read sarcastic.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think it's a stretch
Bill: Tis what I mean by squint.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t think I like that she said the boys were the supporters
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Erik did a REALLY clean job building his armor and he’s only made a shoulder piece before
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that was weird how she said all the guys just supported the girls
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it wasn't a hidden thing, he was posting cool progress pics the entire time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I guess cuz the girls has like alot more armor? Idk
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): idk
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Feels Weird Man™
Bill: She felt supported. That’s good.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i guess but the way it was written sounded like "all the girls looked good and oh by the way the guys supported"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): rubbed me the wrong way
Bill: That’s reading just a bit into it. Captions are always bullshit anyway.
