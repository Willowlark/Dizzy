Bill: If he wants to get deep, and that makes you uncomfortable, say you really think he should talk to someone, but talking to you might not be the best idea. 

if he's being a meme, reply with shorter answers, eventually he'll run out of ways to continue conversation, boom.

*if you still hate him, reply that you can't talk cause you're late, your late, your late for a very important date*
