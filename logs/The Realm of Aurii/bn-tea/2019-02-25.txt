Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~sakura san has 3000 followers and 60 likes on her most recent post, buying followers tends to destroy your engagement~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): maybe a little over 100 actually
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but hey in case anyone didnt catch that shade lmao
Bill: I still have a soft spot for her because she noticed I wasn’t good and ask about how I was at Katsu last year. Even with the stuff David and Alex talked about.
N🆗ri (Marisa): sakuwasan was the girl who coordinated the bnha group at katsu? or is that another
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IT OK

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but i was in a different channel LMAO
Dirty Lego (Tom): WOOOOOOO 🙌
Bill: He DM'd me.
Bill: Good shit.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): SCMREANIGSNS
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): YAS BAYBEEE
Dirty Lego (Tom): YEEE!
N🆗ri (Marisa): how is greg functioning that's horrible not going to class and not even knowing what time the class is at 🙀
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 😒
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He wouldn’t get away with that in most classes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): From experience, physics will kill you after missing three days in a row
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I can’t imagine two weeks
N🆗ri (Marisa): just missing a single class sounds horrifying
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lol most of my classes 2 misses was a fail
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~public policy is like policy sci, it makes sense now~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I can shit on poli sci cause I’m a double major in it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Poli sci is a joke, you show up and give an opinion, and if you have one or two facts to back it up, you get an A
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _im annoyed he’s getting away with so little effort_
N🆗ri (Marisa): my polisci teacher was so strict. if you missed two classes you'd fail, he had huge powerpoints that he wouldn't post online, and we had to run a country simulation the whole semester.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Also I’m shocked he’s been out two full weeks, if he’s only just starting tomorrow does that mean he was sick at Katsu?
N🆗ri (Marisa): *is it his fault i'm sick*
N🆗ri (Marisa): that one time i passed him by the elevators caused me to miss 3 days of work how dare
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Or was he not sick at Katsu but healthy enough to have been in class all last week
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Who knows
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I know my second major is useless but is he actually saying it now
N🆗ri (Marisa): not useless when you become president of the moon
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): god i wanna punt him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): every tellonym he answers becomes so passive aggressive
Bill: Afrin?
Dirty Lego (Tom): Def
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Mmmmmmmmmm
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tellonym was a mistake
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): uh oh
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): when is erik gonna cosplay jahy-sama
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Why does Hal emphasize that’s he’s never been the one who was dumped
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's empowering
N🆗ri (Marisa): it makes him sound like a big jerk
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): No doubt some followers are gonna be like “how could you dump HER”
Bill: And he'll ignore them.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Maybe he won’t answer them, but it’ll get to him mentally
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He’s got like at least 4 questions about his love life and I’ve got 0
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He’s gonna get that whole “Am I seriously still in Georgia’s shadow” thing that was one of the strains on our relationship
N🆗ri (Marisa): you got that totally unprompted question about exes from an unknown stranger <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I can't really string the thoughts together, but the pieces are don't care what he thinks or says, you are all that matters to you, and you write your own story. He doesn't decide anything, so don't stress it. 

Fit the pieces together as you see fit.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m tryna let it go 😭
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But every time he trips up on anything, it’s like _nice_
Bill: I was more thinking don't be effected negatively by him, not shitting on him. If you aren't dwelling on all his tellonyms, letting it get to your mood, that's fine then.
Bill: I still say your better off not looking at his story.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Eh it’s just more annoying
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I’m annoyed with who he is as a person
Bill: sigh. Throwback to when Hal's answer to giving Rei one permission was to give them ALL permissions.
Bill: I should have did it, I assumed he'd intelligently solve the permission issue.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> you remember Casey is in BNE right?
Bill: You're being rather openly anti ethan.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is she
she very quiet does she ever go in
Bill: Just want to make sure you know it could get back to him.
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is good tea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like i said
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): no one likes ethan
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): my frustrations are objective tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im not like "rawr hes a shit"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its more like "hes treating me unfairly"
Bill: I'm okay with that.
Bill: Trust me, I don't like him either.
Bill: Strong opinions in a public channel can make drama, so go into it knowing so is all I meant.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Someone summerize the tea for me was gone 10 mins
N🆗ri (Marisa): ethan bashing
Bill: Georgia just opened the can of worms about the wedding in public chat. Some ethan bashing, fact sharing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: And for the record the guest list for his 'party' is 5 people, and I'm not included despite my best friends you guys going so if you *still* doubt when I say he doesn't like me. That's it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Going?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): HA funny
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We're not going
Bill: Poor choice of words but you get the drift.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I missed my own families wedding in TX cuz of cost I won't be shelling out for hom
Bill: ~~I wouldn't go if I was invited either, to be clear~~
Bill: oh I was talking about the welcome back party.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH I thought it was the wedding
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'll go if I have nothing better to do and wanna watch stuff burn
Bill: Literally anything would be better.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): the more i think about it, the less i want to go
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): their planning is so slipshod too oof
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Of they invite us to the wedding we'll prob burn the invite and laugh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They're the type of people to have this abomination as a cake topper.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): U G H
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): THATS TOO TRUE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The favor will prob be mini bottles of liquor cuz ethan Has to let people know HE LOVES DRINKING
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ahhhhh i h8 this
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): casey why
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): there are so many young dateable men in jersey
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ethan is soooo bad
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im breakin out in like, an angry sweat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He's like red flag depot
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But also I'm not touching this in BNE
Bill: *smart*
Bill: but hey. Maybe Casey will wake up seeing it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~i dont think she'd be too happy to see it thou~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): besides the fact that i doubt she'll see
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i don't know her but i think anyone would be upset
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its something she should realize
Bill: No. But there's nothing to do but point out what everyone else sees and hope she makes a choice for herself.
Bill: Can lead a horse to water...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm not saying she shouldnt hear it it's just I don't know if shell be able to see a whole server mocking her life choices
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Idk confrontation is scary
Bill: Wow this tea session is going to have repercussions all over, faaaaantastic.
N🆗ri (Marisa): we could start using the instagram to show that we're not elitist if needed. i doubt anyone's really saying that anyway, aside from ethan.
Bill: We aren't put people are going to start thinking.
Bill: Status quo has been kicked in the balls.
Bill: It’s a good fucking thing I didn’t send that invite. I outright said “you’re part of our squad” and with this clique shot I’d look exactly like the problem.
Bill: Ugh ffs you don’t point out to a political group that has subdivisions that those divisions exist.
Bill: That forms a rift.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ok i had a meeting wtf happened
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I actually don’t know either I was on the phone with ethan for 45 mins lol
Bill: You opened the flood gates to publicly shit on Ethan.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk what happened in the 45 minutes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And Casey knows all this
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Her best friend Alex stopped talking to her and said it’s Ethan’s fault
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Roman told Casey that Ethan’s bad for her
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like this ain’t new information
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She’s not gonna be shocked, though I concede reading all the dragging isn’t necessarily pleasant
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She never logs in though
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If you’re worried I’d delete the server to clear it
Bill: That’s well and good. I agree with all of it and don’t like Ethan either. But public roasting, that’s going to hurt whether you knew the opinions or not. BNE doesn’t want to be cliquey, well starting up a gossip storm is NOT the way to come off that way.
Bill: I see her online time to time in the mornings.
Bill: And it’s your best friend, who you put up with the abusive ass Ethan for in the first place.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Then say maybe “this gossiping isn’t representative of who BNE is, we don’t make fun of people together, I’m clearing the server”
Bill: There is no mass delete button Georgia.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You can’t delete the channel and then make another with the same exact name?
N🆗ri (Marisa): no one will notice
Bill: Except for two years of backlog.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I doubt anyone cares about the backlog
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You’re giving peacekeeper vibes right now anyways, I’m sure most would agree with you if you think that’s proper damage control
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the idea of BNE being cliquey seem seperate fromt eh ethan bashing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i just didnt was casey too read that and feel hurt
Bill: I said it early on. Nothing on the Internet is truly private. She could be on invisible for all we know.
Bill: People said their piece knowing that and I don’t think “we can delete it later” is a good habit to reinforce.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mostly complained about Austin and Tarik eh
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Though there was definitely some ethan shitting
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I guess I’m glad you stopped it tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It was tongue in cheek as is
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But could’ve gotten worse
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Shell probably see it as lots of Ethan bashing tho cuz that what most important to her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also I would out it past Ethan to look at her phone
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like alot
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg did you purge it
N🆗ri (Marisa): Was there any warning I was sloshing rice I missed it
N🆗ri (Marisa): Can I write first
Bill: Hal deleted it when I asked if he was in agreement with me and Georgia. I wanted to log the channel with Dizzy and say what I just did before he did, but he's always on the wrong page with me.
Bill: We've had our first instance of Admin power use in BNE, yaaay
N🆗ri (Marisa): How could u let Matt be first I’m Ruined
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s now the most powerful person in that chat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's still very likely that Casey will find out about it
Bill: Alright. I feel better having said the blanket piece, but clearing. At least it's an attempt to protect her feelings.
Bill: She may have been on invisible this whole time.
Bill: Ethan could have said what he did intentionally, had Casey lurk, and read the whole thing.
Bill: I wouldn't put it past him.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Knowing Ethan he's probably logged into her discord
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Who said the thing about Ethan saying BNE is cliquey?
Bill: Because he's an abusive ass?
Bill: Georgia.
Bill: It technically is. Aurii is a clique, "delaware" is a clique, squid squad is a clique.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Exactly
Bill: but if we don't *comment* on that, we all co-exist peacefully.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm just scared 😔
Bill: Me too.
Bill: This was a glorious shitshow.
Dirty Lego (Tom): It'll be alright
Bill: I'm not doing another season of con drama.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Casey will find out about it someday through the grapevine, won't be able to keep that many people quiet
N🆗ri (Marisa): I didn’t think the clique thing was such a big deal. Was it becoming one?
Dirty Lego (Tom): Nah it's not, one person outside of ylour group commented that they think that a while ago
Bill: Not really.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Or had heard that rather
Bill: They exist, but they aren't a problem. The cliques are often just the room divide at cons, roommates hang with roommates.
Bill: Bless Hal for actually taking the call to stop the tea time when I put it out there. He's argumentative and an idiot, but he at least respected that.
Bill: And I wouldn't be surprised if Hunter spills it soonish. He's loose lipped. He does hate Ethan, so at least it'll be in a positive light.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> Should we tell Hal he can remove full admin from Rei? They were never supposed to have full powers, and since we've had to use admin powers I'd like to make sure whose making calls like that clear.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Sounds good
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ERIK IS A GOOD BOI
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG
Bill: Alright yeah I suppose that sells it.
