秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): What should I do if my letter package thing doesn’t arrive in time? Is there anything I can do to make it up to my secret Santa recipient other than an “it’s on it’s way out there somewhere in the vast postal system” because that would suck being the only person not getting anything at the party
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Can I buy them like a fruit roll up as a placebo or something
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nah I think it will be okay 👌 if it doesn't arrive, they'll just get it later

Bill: I was going to take a photo of a family playing in the lobby, lined it up, then the mom happened to look my way and I panicked and made to look like I was cleaning the lens. Now I’m irrationally worried she’s going to go suburban on me (this was like an hour ago and I’m not in the same place), and disappointed cause I just don’t have it in me for “street” photography.
Bill: I did watch a documentary on street photography and one guy apparently asked everyone he took candids of, but like? Talking to people?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Hmmm
Bill: Uuuuuugghhghhaaaa

Bill: I like photographing people, but everyone I shoot for portrait wise has lives to live, and shooting randos wigs me out...
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's fine
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It's not for everyone
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I wouldn't do it myself either
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): You can usually get away with it in super crowded touristy areas where everyone has a camera out
Bill: Erik is on his way and Katy is already getting short with us!
Bill: 😒
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cool!
