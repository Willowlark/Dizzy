Bill: And a dream about just snuggling and watching Netflix with someone who wants to snuggle and watch Netflix with me. Which is. Wholesome, and... nice. It’s nice to just want... something simple. No complications. Makes it feel like there’s a way that’ll happen.
Bill: Hard to describe. Just. Haven’t thought of romantic things positively in a long while.
Bill: Why do I find these two so cute.
Bill: > gets up to find out where to meet Dad for dinner
> looks in mirror
> this is going to be one of the rare times I wear a hat
N🆗ri (Marisa): bne cuddle dorm grand opening when

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause he followed me and I didn’t wanna seem butthurt by not following back

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Curiosity killed the cat tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): but satisfaction brought it back
Bill: You picked a bad day for curiosity.
