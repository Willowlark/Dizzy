Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): "i dont understand people in relationships anymore"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): "i see sex so differently now"
Bill: *Stop playing League with him*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He‚Äôs saying he doesn‚Äôt understand with meg
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes still innebriated from magfest
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he hooked up with meg at the end of october
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im learning so much
Bill: Maybe do him a favor and give him space?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He said he talked to meg recently about it and they just end up shrugging
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He said they were both severely depressed over winter
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): THE TEA
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tries to leave >>> he stalls
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): big off
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "I'm having casual sex and everyone needs to know"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "I'm on a whole other level because I don't currently practice monogamy"
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): i dont understand people in relationships anymore is a weird one
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): WHAT
Is that what he actually said or is that the implication
Both are terrifying
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He said the ones Georgia said I'm just being a butt.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): I hear a lot of US airports are having major issues <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye it was weird
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It was like he was asking for help with meg but also not
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I found his explanation of what they did weird too like ‚Äúthey talked and then shrugged and nothing happened‚Äù
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like... if two people like each other enough it should be pretty straightforward what you should do
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Help with what though? Sleeping with her again? Dating?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I think dating?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause all he kept saying was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand relationships anymore‚Äù
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And he was also shocked that people (ethan) were making cheating accusations about HIM when I started talking to Noah early September
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~granted I pointed out that talking doesn‚Äôt mean much‚Äî
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But apparently he has been sleeping around cause he said he slept with someone the night we broke up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And then slept with a couple people until meg in October
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And it seems they have a steady friends with benefits thing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _and he told all this to his ex, so he really must have no one to talk to_
Bill: And you need to set the precedence now if you're going to be the person he talks to about this. Don't start listening to him so he builds up trust with you again and bail later because of the inevitable awkwardness.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Well he wasn‚Äôt like ‚Äúcan I talk to you?‚Äù but more like ‚Äúgosh I‚Äôm so emotionally cooped up that I just gotta throw these words out here to feel relief‚Äù
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If he starts to actually ask for advice on meg im gonna tell him it‚Äôs inappropriate to ask me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But if he‚Äôs just complaining about his weird sex life and inability to make decisions himself, I don‚Äôt really care ü§∑
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He was very keen on knowing exactly when I started talking to Noah too, that was odd
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ***hal is just odd***
