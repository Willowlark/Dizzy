Bill: Or:
Bill: 🍿
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ooh hunter messaged me about ethan
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ethan is his secret Santa
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He hates the guy now tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): UGH that sucks 😭
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Another one of caseys friends, chased away
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Oof
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): from that comment? or did he dislike him before
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): did my letter arrive yet ;u;
i just got a letter that was mailed around 3 weeks ago so if it takes the same amount of time mine will hopefully arrive soon
Bill: Not surprising, Ethan and Hunter are polar opposites.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I have found none yet 😮
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And yeah but I was happy casey had someone to talk to
Bill: Hunter doesn’t hate Casey now does he?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i doubt it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the conversation went further, hal came in with some facts about the shutdown too. so then ethan argued with him too
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which post was it on?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hal probably had a lot of pent up anger at Ethan to begin with oops
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~the gov. has been shut down 3 times since trumps been in office~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats just a fun fact tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): https://www.facebook.com/zombiehunter825/posts/2050955731607931?__xts__[0]=68.ARB64t8NccBNdDucsmcxZPaqocU0Kj60aUGwTG3DCqkPxR2gHdBDdcxfhDpZ1iw7EIg3nr496zRdKuzdGyAu5K8EALZ9W9Hv-Wq5yXA_nAN9zV49QlKAom4XmlUCuxhzGLSZEam6Wy9hYvSZW7PUeCX-TWUBS9ClZK8tax1vyGyQix1XDmNOMYQn0HidDmKZwzTcU8GdH75dNVW5WbRWKDaMqoAv-0CZuaTeChPMx2VO0jJxSv52u5-KYBsWWRT0Tx8rPfO9FE2BZ16xREzZBqh3Y3Ju8l_z5huPmMbMYTeyA2QZVPXVjnt6L6STSf-MqGBPqU-_2ke6eN9nK3vieYXEBk0&__tn__=-R
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): idk if that will wok but thats the post
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): link not work <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ok this da meme:
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): thank!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and dis da comments
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Boys gone wild
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "Trump's changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans. When asked by reporters what the way forward was, retiring Tennessee Senator Bob Corker laughed: "I don't know. Y'all have fun. I'm getting ready to drive to Chattanooga... You can’t make this stuff up."
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what a mood
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): "I don't say what I say to say"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t think anyone’s arguing particularly eloquently
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah but thats pretty normal for political debates on facebook
Bill: None of them are any good at expressing opinions.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hunter hates trump straight up, he is most likley a "one issue" voter. a very important issue i will say,a nd of course i dont blame him but trumps stance on nothing else besides lgbt matters will matter to hunter because of it.

ethan likes to play devils advocate, he likes to see people get riled up about something he thrives on it 

honestly in this situation hal has the most relevant and truthful information after doing some research
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): pertaining to the government shutdown, and not lgbt rights, which is what the og post was about
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You’re 100% right
Bill: sounds about right.
Bill: I would have boiled it down to Hunters too emotional, Ethan's a troll, and Hal has a chip on his shoulder to be right.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like a shitty three musketeers scenario
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hunter has a right to be emotional about whats going on pertaining to lgbt rights, ethan is indeed a troll, and while hal does need to be right he actually seems to know his shit when it comes to political goings on.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): BUT the og post was about the shutdown, not lgbt rights, making hunters emotional statements irrelevant to this particular topic
Bill: It's not a problem to be emotional. It can either strengthen or weaken an argument, and Hunter being *very emotional* makes it a weaker argument. For the reasons you mentioned.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): good tea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): also, ethan is wrong becuase while those are the only 3 failures listing in the meme, trump has many other failed businesses
Bill: *Remember folks, Political twitter memes are clearly a irrefutable fact about the world*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and this is why i dont comment on stuff on facebook <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: YUP
Bill: especially politics.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah fuck that shit lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Jess broke that down pretty nicely tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THANKS BABE
Bill: protip Georgia; don't point out you've already bought the thing when other people are lamenting they can't right now. It won't come off well. It's why I didn't say I booked CCE already.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ah sorry wasn’t thinking
Bill: It's something Meg could jump on you for, and I know that's been bothering you. 😃
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Thank, I appreciate there being less material that she can rip into me for
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tho based on Hal’s testimony they slept together a couple times and called it quits so idk why she would get on my case 🙄
Bill: I don't pretend to know anything about that drama.
Bill: But in general, not talking about money in a public setting is like politics/religion; sometimes for the best.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I think I make the lesser end of the spectrum of group money just cause full time student
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So I usually don’t think because everyone I believe works more hours than I do
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~tho I also don’t waste my money on drugs like some of them do, THATS tea~~
Bill: is it tea if it's just shots fired?
Bill: you'd be the lesser end of Aurii, cause we're pretty much graduated and in career jobs. Not BNE.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Uhhhh idk I work 10 hours every other week 😂
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s 5 hours a week average
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I know hal and meg work about 30 hours because they only took like 2-3 classes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _can their quotes stop being about sex_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _do they know it’s not just sexual things in out of context_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): for real
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Some of them are funny but there’s a point where it’s distasteful
Bill: maybe it was funnier in contxt.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I can’t even guess at the context escape maybe diddles in the theater
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I was annoyed by it but now I realize that meg quoting every dirty thing hal says isn’t helping their reptutation
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): GURL DONT U WORRY BOUT DAT
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): IT JUST ANNOYIN like I feel like she deliberately wants to be like “ya I fucked ur ex lol”
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): she just likes to talk about fuckin
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like _you dirty potheaded child_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean, i like to talk about fuckin too but....
Bill: ~~you all do~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But she just talks about it with hal which is weird
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And sorta insensitive
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like if I went and hooked up with her ex you bet your ass I wouldn’t talk around it with her nearby
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I wouldn’t be like “haha sam loves making people cum lol”
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yeet
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): esspecially if she was the one dumped...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea u right, is kinda mean
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _she knows I’m in BNE_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The worst part is I remember I invited her to Konkon last year I believe
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which is why she’s in BNE now
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _past georgia u fucker_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i kinda get the feeling meg doesn't really know what it feels like to be on the revcving end of the pain? but idk much about her so i could be wrong
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She says she has commitment issues
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I haven’t heard about a boyfriend since Sam
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Or before
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And that lasted all of 2-3 months
Bill: it's entirely possible she doesn't realize or care. Not care is in she's not doing it to hurt you, she's just doing her own thing and isn't thinking of Hal as "Georgia's ex".
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): mmm tru
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I feel like I talked to her enough to realize
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hal and I visited her a lot when she worked at jo Ann’s
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I spend a whole night detoxing hal after she and him did shots
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like hal and I were together a year so she must’ve caught on
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~I still remember sams her ex and therefore don’t talk about her when she’s in the chat~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~and like I said they lasted a handful of months~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like I said though, their attitudes are imploding their own reputation so 🤷‍♀️
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hal’s just gonna keep being upset about everyone suspecting him and they’re just gonna keep giving people reasons to suspect
Bill: ~~I doubt most of BNE gives a shit about this particular piece of drama~~
Bill: They aren't connected to it.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It was the talk of Halloween 👀
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And rebecca still messages me about it
Bill: At your house. As brand new drama.
Bill: maybe then.
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I give you complaining about Hunter if you give me complaining about Meg 👀👀👀
Bill: I said most of BNE.
Bill: Not all of it.
Bill: We're your close friends, we care.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Well I assume cause Rebecca’s bringing it up then the PA girls follow the drama
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean i think most of them probably have an opinion on the matter if asked
Bill: But they aren't reading into every single thing Meg and Hal say for more.
Bill: (not saying anyone is)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i bet you some are though rebecca is prob all 👀 everytime XD
Bill: ~~I said most~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye there’s definitely eyerolls
Bill: I can see that tho. Rebecca seems to like drama.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Reminds her of her ex
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She’s living vicariously through it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): reis gotta be watching that shit too XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think at *least* rebecce, erik, rei and leanna prob got thoughts about it
Bill: Everyone's going to have an opinion on it.
Bill: Actually, I take that back.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 😏
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hunters had Hal on his radar ever since the “I think hal might be sexist” message
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH YEA
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Even Ryan’s paying attention
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause Ryan’s in the league group where hal blew up the other day
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The only people I can confidently say aren’t paying attention are prob gen and Chris
Bill: Heather.
Bill: Matt, maybe.
Bill: No one, it *Katsu*.
Bill: Groan.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think mat and heathrnd her bf already have rooms
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): O this isn't convention s
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ignore m
