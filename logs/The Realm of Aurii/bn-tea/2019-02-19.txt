Bill: Apparently the cats out of the bag, Katy knows we don’t like Erik. 

Apparently she’s been fighting with him over the same reasons we’re concerned.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i thought we did like erik and that's why he was in the room with us
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ohhh no not that erik
N🆗ri (Marisa): o
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): biru's sisters boyfriend is named erik too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we like room erik!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo wow that's confusing <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Especially since they both spell it in the same weird way!
Bill: Oof those Hunter photos spark that inferiority complex.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're nice but there's something about them. i don't think i'm very fond of his style. they're good pictures but they don't feel like cosplay photos except for the georgia one
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~also he asked for my insta and never followed ;u;~~
Bill: I haven’t looked at my photos but I know I rushed Nier and had aforementioned issues so my expectations are low... surprise surprise.
N🆗ri (Marisa): But u photos are good they give off that fantastical cosplay vibe
Bill: Mmm.... thank you but like. Hard to convince myself of that.
Bill: But also oof they all PAID him and still shot with him. ~~I’ve know Gen two years damnit why have I never shot winter~~
Bill: *~~Tom voice: You never asked~~*
N🆗ri (Marisa): If he price go up more people book u
Bill: But like. That just means I’m the cheaper option.
N🆗ri (Marisa): :(
Hm I see the conundrum
Hmmm
N🆗ri (Marisa): U gotta do more shoots and get ur name out there bada bing bada boom
Bill: I dunno man, it’s not like I don’t immediately want to do the photos of every cosplay for everyone here, cause I love you guys. I like doing that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Then start charging
Bill: It’s straight up automatic to assume I will.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean i booked you for mina and MM. renora was more unplanned neir was something you wanted more than me
Bill: That’s true. feels like I’m missing out on something is all? I dunno what I want these days.
Bill: Gotta go look at the photos tonight and see if that relaxes me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): cons feel weird nowadays. not like they used to be. i can't quite put my finger on it. they aren't as fulfilling? and not because there's been so many of them. it just seems like conventions have gotten more.... unexciting. it's not like the "WOO! ONCE A YEAR EXTRAVAGANZA!" it used to be. it's gotten to be  more of a "haha here we are again. ok see u next year."
N🆗ri (Marisa): the panels are less varied and they've lost the spontaneity that was unique to cons
Bill: I kinda get that.
Bill: Part of it is Hunter is a student and has a lot more time to work on it... Plus his connection to the famous people... And his parents are photographers... and he clearly intends to become one himself. Deck is rather stacked against me with that scenario.
Bill: I definitely got light stuff outta an attempt to match him. Still haven't really used softboxes <:rip:369476083248267274> but the flash I'll see how validated that purchase is with the MM stuff.
Bill: Oh wait Katarina.
Bill: Maybe it's more the "I'm losing my friends, the people who were shooting with me who I knew and could relax with" aspect. BNE keeps drifting his way. That's... probably more likely.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think you need to figure out what *you* want from your photos, not what other people are doing
Bill: I think you are right.
Bill: *Does anyone remember when I was a happy person? I don't*
Bill: Sigh.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): right around when you graduated you seemed really happy
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah laying on the table in japanese class. good times.
Bill: good times.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): CCE 2017
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh <@301927856240459777> I agree about the cons thing
Dirty Lego (Tom): I've been saying that lately
Bill: man why tho. I can't remember that far back.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): theres too many now
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah there's a ton more conventions so they aren't as special
but that should also mean more diversity and such right? instead they're all kind of the same thing in different locations
Bill: and if you go to less cons you get FOMO from everyone else going to them.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Collosol still feels nice tho
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like exclusive
Bill: yeah. Hell, I wanna go there now for a relaxing day.
Dirty Lego (Tom): And a next for me
Dirty Lego (Tom): The rest? Idk
Bill: I'm not sure why, but I think doing more non con stuff together would be good for the con feel. If cons are all we do, it's stale, but if we do other things together...
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's to many consnis the issue
Dirty Lego (Tom): But I also can't rightly think of any I'd drop
Bill: Zenkai is a must for me. Katsu and Ota less so. I like Next and CCE too.
Bill: I'm not sure, but I'm with Jess. I wanna do some more non cosplay stuff together.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 𝓃𝑜𝓃-𝒸𝑜𝓈𝓅𝓁𝒶𝓎!??
N🆗ri (Marisa): movie night movie night
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we also dont DO any of the stuff at the con
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we cosplay, take pics, go shopping
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): maybe go to a formal
Bill: Also to the con degradation is like how you go from 'generic attendee who goes to panels and dealers' to 'cosplayer who doesn't panel anymore' to 'panelist and judge'.
Bill: Yeah, same line of thought.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we dont do panels, we dont enter contests, we rarely go to raves
Bill: We're just... growing into new things. or in this case, need to grow into something new.
Bill: I'm raving in the future.
Bill: I'mma hit up Ryan, David, the Jessies and go dance.
Bill: All of them rave frequently.
Bill: Marisa was right before about panels though, they have basically been the same thing in the last 10 years.
N🆗ri (Marisa): panelists and judges at least get free entry because they work at the con
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i like raving but tom doesnt ussualy
Bill: Music is at least better than formals.
Bill: We should do an escape room again.
Bill: It's different.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hmm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Im not a huge fan of them but everyone else seems to be
Bill: ~~sorry if my downer mood to Katsu is bringing everyone else down by the way~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw life sucks
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Bill: life can't suck, because Mawisa exists!
N🆗ri (Marisa): who that
Bill: you!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ??????????
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ugh PMS is making me so aggressive
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I just want to fight everyone
N🆗ri (Marisa): live your dreams
N🆗ri (Marisa): punch a h uman
バナナ: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): dave did you see the fractured but whole group
N🆗ri (Marisa): they were fantastic
バナナ: Group of?
N🆗ri (Marisa): cosplayers
N🆗ri (Marisa): toolshed, human kite, mysterion, professor chaos, call girl, wonder tweek, and supercraig i think
バナナ: Oh, didn't see them
N🆗ri (Marisa): i love them
Dirty Lego (Tom): let's put on some combat gear and fight
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And like I like hunter and his work but if he keeps bumping prices up I can’t really shoot with him anymore
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m really frustrated by only making 200 bucks a month
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like fuck damn maybe I should get naked
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Those girls pocket 1K a month
バナナ: I want to see people cosplay the South Park kids when they have their anime personas from getting weapons from the flea market
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): lets fighting love
Dirty Lego (Tom): Nah any decent paying full time job will net you that girl 👌
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like not minimum
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah I guess I’m more frustrated being on the lower money making end of BNE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If I wanted to hire Hunter and Rebecca for a con, it takes almost half a paycheck
N🆗ri (Marisa): u also a student tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): u gotta study
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But you still in college
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye I wish I was done 😔
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I feel like a kid hanging out with adults
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Don't wish you were done! Youll get to work for the rest of your life but you only get to be a college kid for a few years
Bill: Oh yeah, good point.
Bill: Also oof.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it the drinking thing? the feeling like a kid part
also most bne members are graduates right
Bill: Not drinking thing.
Bill: Most of BNE isn't particularly well off... Rebecca and Hunter are students, but the latter is a rich boi. Anna and Erik are in tech like me. Gen works at a bank...
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo
is ok georgia im poor too we can be poor together
Bill: Leanna isn't loaded by any means....
Bill: You used to pay for most of your shoots right? Did Claire and the rest have low rates?
Bill: Or did they all just shoot you free?
N🆗ri (Marisa): shoots used to be so much cheaper, they've gone up exponentially
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah most of bne is actually pretty broke
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Nah I just used to pay for one shoot a con
Dirty Lego (Tom): Cept Erik Hunter me Jess and Bill
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But now I have a following I feel like I have to keep up with content
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ergo, more photos
Bill: We did 5 shoots at Katsu Georgia.
Bill: And booked grey towers again.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye I know
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I feel bad tho cause theoretically I should be paying you too
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Thankfully I have the skill to do commissions
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But physics has shat on that
Bill: Despite what I was saying before, I don't really want money from shoots.
Bill: I may be using photoshoots as a placeholder for strength of *friendship* which is definitely a bad thing, thinking about it today.
Bill: oof. "If they like the photos they'll like you".
Bill: I've been commenting on that behavior in Anna for a month, I missed that about me.
Bill: sigh. another oof for today.
Bill: Also you have no obligation to deal with your instagram following while trying to get a degree in physics. They're just a number on instagram. Not friends, not schoolwork, not family, not your happiness. Focus on the important things.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah I guess
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’d like to keep developing my ability to cosplay though
Bill: that's *you*, not follower content.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~especially because as you get more recognized you stop havin to pay as much for things~~
Bill: ~~when you get a nasa job you don't have to worry about being able to pay for things~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean i really am looking forward to that 5000 stipend
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats like a legit salary for 10 weeks
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): well not really
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats 26k for a year which is sorta smol
Bill: I was. about to say.
Bill: That's... very small.
Bill: That's less than a bus driver's yearly salary.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats big for a college student who otherwise makes 2400 a year lol
Bill: you are correct. Just. keep in mind off the top of my head I'd peg you in the 60k salary bracket graduating.
Bill: You will make *significantly* more money than any patreon will get you.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah just for the next year and a half itll be a source of frustration
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~possibly more based on grad school but thats future georgias problem~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): even if i can snag a research job next year i can make about 20K a year while being a senior in school at least
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats what physics pays its research students
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tl;dr i cant wait to make 60K a year but damn it feels so far away 😭
Bill: You and the rest of the world.,
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah it'll come tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thank you adultier adults
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its hard to keep the "timeline of life" in perspective
Bill: Anyway, just cause of Hunter and Rebecca raising prices doesn't make you broke. Hunter has the famous clientele who will at least pay it, Rebecca might suffer for it.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah trust me I wish I was back in school
Bill: ~~what happened to you going back anyway~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): But also I like having my own money
Dirty Lego (Tom): And control
Dirty Lego (Tom): Both have their ups and downs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~having a full time job happened~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeetus
Bill: *mood*
Dirty Lego (Tom): Also the regular raises at my current job doesn't help for motivation to go back to school ..
Bill: I did grad school straight through because I would never have done it with a job.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ^^^ its my plan to do that but NASA may have other plans depending on how I perform
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): the woman helping me had her grad degree paid for cause NASA hired her
Bill: companies do that yes. Night school degrees are hard though.
Bill: Ash is pretty familar with that.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): true, but worth it for NASA
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): not really any other companies tho lmao
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): toms work does that its just it would prob take him 10 yrs to get a degree while working
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): the other factor was that universities are far from yall right?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yup closest is 40 mins?
Dirty Lego (Tom): 
Dirty Lego (Tom): <@301927856240459777>
Dirty Lego (Tom): You said something about the grass
Dirty Lego (Tom): HAHAHA MY PHONE TRIED TO CORRECT IT TO GEASS
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LOL too good
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH THE GRASS
N🆗ri (Marisa): Where did it go
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): c u t
N🆗ri (Marisa): They might be talking about the grass outside too what happen to that
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🙀
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): rewatching the animenext vlog is so wholesome
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i hate to say it but hal was a good person to vlog with
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he is v. charismatic, lots of energy
Bill: He was barely in it too, iirc.
Bill: Weee I have three projects all trying to say their issue is critical this week and I don't have the time for all their shit.
Bill: *If I stay late I drink the free booze tho*
Bill: ~~I fucking stayed late and Gord was like 'no time to talk, got an interview, try Sean'~~
Bill: Tell me that 40 minutes ago.
Bill: Sean is fucking offline right now two.
Bill: It’s been so long since I stayed late I forgot the train timing. So I guess I’m staying LATE late.
Bill: I need a new vice. I don’t consider booze much of a vice, and comfort food off the table cause diet.
Bill: Cocaine?
Dirty Lego (Tom): COCAINE
Dirty Lego (Tom): FIGHTING GAMES FAM
Bill: Nah boi a vice supposed to feel good not like death.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Pretty sure cocaine kills you but ok
Bill: Oh shit rip.
Bill: You can’t deny a death by cocane wouldn’t be more euphoric than death by fighting game salt.
Bill: I COMPLETELY forgot how to spell the word in the last twenty minutes.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you could be a partier lmao
Bill: What?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): party boi
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): get blackout drunk with the party bois
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🎉
Bill: Ye no.
Dirty Lego (Tom): COSPLAY BOI
Dirty Lego (Tom): put in them hours
