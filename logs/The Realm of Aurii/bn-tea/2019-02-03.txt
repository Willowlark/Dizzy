Bill: Is... Rei complaining about being thin on their story?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea people can be insecure about being thin too
Dirty Lego (Tom): Ye Justin is super insecure about it
Dirty Lego (Tom): People are def insecure about it
Dirty Lego (Tom): I think I was at a time
Bill: Hmm. It’s valid just. Imo at least you’re conventionally attractive. Nobody is 100% happy with their look (unless you very special) but there’s problems that will cause you less stress than others.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Eh? It's all perspective honestly
Bill: I think it’s a fair assessment that most people find skinny better than fat.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah but who cares if you’re conventionally attractive if you’re uncomfortable in your own body
N🆗ri (Marisa): Human bodies are all horrifying
Bill: Would you rather be alone and uncomfortable with yourself, or still able to be attractive to someone and have a relationship while you are uncomfortable with yourself? 

And if you work to become comfortable with yourself, if you do so while not conventionally attractive you’ll still be lonely.
Bill: MARISA RIGHT.
N🆗ri (Marisa): bones are freaky
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Validation shouldn’t come from the outside world, it should come from yourself <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s easier said than done, but still
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Also did I tell you guys about the enlightening dream I had the other day
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Maybe a week ago?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I dreamed that Hal came up to me at Katsu and asked to get back together. And I was like “I would already say no. But I’m especially saying no because you made me feel like a failure when you dumped me. So now I want you to be the failure”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I woke up like whaaaat the fuck, that’s it, that’s why I’m still petty despite moving on to a new relationship
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I felt like a failure because I had been dumped, and ever since then I’ve been trying to prove to myself that he’s the failure
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I remembered that dream now cause I’m talkin to Scott and he’s talking about being friends with Meg and my knee jerk reaction is “y tho”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): This meme exactly
N🆗ri (Marisa): Prophecy dream
We gotta get it on tape if it happens irl
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Update he said he doesn’t really have any personal talks with her and doesn’t see the friendship progressing beyond shallowness
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Scott is good boi
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): OMG IF THAT HAPPENS AT KATSU IM GONNA SCREAM
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~when~~ if it does u gotta tell us asap
Dirty Lego (Tom): Plz no ~~but if it happens do tell us asap~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): Also wow that dream, your sub concious literally spelling it out for you
Dirty Lego (Tom): Sometimes dreams make so much sense
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah I woke up real fast and Noah was like “adhfskch what happened” and I was like C L A R I T Y
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Also Scott’s saying his problem with a friendship with Meg is that she doesn’t talk about anything personal
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Seeing as she “doesn’t like relationships” and “doesn’t believe in love” I guess I’m not surprised that she has trouble emotionally connecting
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah that's kinda an issue with ever getting close to anyone
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah even just as friends
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like I don’t feel vulnerable showing you guys my emotions cause I trust y’all 💕
Bill: See the second paragraph. You may feel validated,  but the world has stereotypes for a reason.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk I still stand by what I said
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Sure it’s nice to have other people attracted to you but if you don’t love yourself then you’re just gonna be insecure and wonder why they’re attracted to you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I would rather love myself 100% than be conventionally attractive
Bill: I can’t discuss this. So fair.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's just a matter of perspective, I used to think skinny people couldn't dislike their bodies because it was what I wanted but then I met skinny people who were just as insecure as me, or even more so. Loving yourself is the most important thing though.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I had a dream about concrunch, also very telling
Bill: You can be happy with yourself and still be disliked by other people. Eventually you get tired of just you. You do need to be happy with yourself, conventional attractiveness doesn’t replace that. But it’s worse to be happy with yourself and still be rejected by others, rather than others being accepting (which can help you to like yourself).
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah but then you could also become dependent on outside people for validation
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I was more insecure when I was younger, and when other people gave me attention, I learned to be dependent on that attention
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And it’s done a lot of damage in my older years
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I never really learned to love myself first so I thought everyone else’s opinion of me was a good surrogate
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which is why things like breaking up with Hal WRECKED me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk, to each his own
Bill: You are correct to say that’s important. It is. My point is that you are better off unhappy and skinny than unhappy and fat, because stereotyping is a thing and it’s called “conventional” for a reason.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The bigger point is that if you’re unhappy, you’re unhappy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Outside attention, especially for appearance, is vapid and can’t make you happy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You say you’re better off being skinny because other people will stereotypically find you attractive
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But who gives a shit if you’re upset with who you are already? Their attention doesn’t replace your ability to be happy
Bill: And if you’re happy with yourself while still heavy, you can end up rejected by others no matter how great you feel about yourself. Then you’ve just taken a hit that says no matter what you think, other people won’t agree.
Bill: Good self image doesn’t change the fact EVERYONE else in the world doesn’t see you like you.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s an over generalization
Bill: They see the stereotype first. Of course, people change.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): People still find personalities and the like attractive
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Feeling like shit is shitty doesn't matter which way you come to the shittiness
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You make it sound like reiley can’t be insecure because at least they’re conventionally attractive
Bill: I’ve long stopped talking about Rei.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Okay then there’s no heirarchy to being unhappy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Skinny people have every reason to be as miserable as fat people
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): No ones better off
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Outside attention doesn’t matter when you’re upset with yourself, period
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You might claim that Jess and I can’t understand that because were “conventionally attractive”
Bill: I have not.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I said might
Bill: If I did that’d be bullshit.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ok so you’re saying “hey at least between skinny people and fat people, if both are unhappy, at least the skinny people are loved by society”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I’m claiming “see, but it doesn’t matter if you’re unhappy nonetheless
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): We’ll have to agree to disagree
Bill: The point is that when you ARE body positive, if you’re heavy there’s still a pretty fair chance other people won’t see what you’re positive about. They’ll consider you DIFFERENTLY.
Bill: Do you can feel GREAT and STILL get hurt.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Feels like you are trying to say that only bigger people are entitled to feeling insecure
Bill: Not about entitlement. I’m saying in the four scenarios, I’d say unhappy and skinny better than happy and heavy. They’re all still net negative. But one less so than the other.
Bill: Rei can’t control how they feel and what they want for themselves. Obviously I think they should be happy that they are who they are because I know them and they are a good person, and encourage them to strive for any improvement they feel hey need.
Bill: Their feelings are justified.
Bill: This is the high level objective statement that has gotten much less objective.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Rather than weight I think it’s grooming that people care more about. If you’re overweight to the point of disability and it hinders your life people will judge. If you’re overweight and gross because you don’t groom yourself people will judge. But if you’re overweight and can function independently and take care of proper hygiene then it’s fine. Same with how skinny people can be gross greasy messes and no one wants to associate with them. Just take showers and brush your teeth.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not related to how people view themselves but that’s how people view other people
Bill: It’s not instead of, but that’s another good example Mawisa.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The general person doesn't dislike overweight people as much as you seem to think. I think
Bill: I’m running off of my own experiences. Other people may have other experiences.
Bill: Calvin was certainly popular in high school. Somehow.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah like... Snows girlfriend is pretty thicc and she’s popular as fuck
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I agree with Jess, I feel like the average person doesn’t care THAT much
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean it’s frowned upon to be “fatphobic”, that’s already pretty telling
Bill: That’s a different thing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): In the end it's all subjective
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wonder if my paint really sucks that bad ;u;
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's really similar to the 'fancy' paint we used in my painting class
N🆗ri (Marisa): what kind of paint do you guys use 👀
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The cheap kind LOL
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): At least in acrylics
N🆗ri (Marisa): phew
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I just use like apple barrel or folk art
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I've used then like my whole life 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): FOLKART YEAH THAT'S THE BRAND
N🆗ri (Marisa): the 90 cent stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): good stuff
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
