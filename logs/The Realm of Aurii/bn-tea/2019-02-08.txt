Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I low key can’t wait til Katsu is over and I can unfollow this Nora
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She’s like the worst type of Instagram cosplayer cause she keeps asking people to find her stuff like every day and has the worst same face/pose syndrome
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like, it’s bad, every photo is from the same angle
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you doing a group together?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah she recruited me to do a jnpr group
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _ok but like this is bad same pose syndrome_
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh. oh wow yeah.
are the second pictures the same? maybe it's some kind of aesthetic thing and the second images are more varied?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): No they’re just... more poses... from the same angle
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like what does the left side of her face look like? Idk
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): damn thats takes "get my good side" soo a whoe new level
N🆗ri (Marisa): i get the feeling she takes the pictures directly on her computer and then just shops and uploads them
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And she deletes any photo that doesn’t get as many likes as she wants
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHAT
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But like, she begs people to like them first so she doesn’t “have to delete them”????
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wtffff
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like she’s put “come on you guys won’t let this post flop or I’ll delete it”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I’m like holy crap just stfu
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She has like 9K followers? Idk how tho oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's what i was trying to figure out the other day with a girl i'm meeting at katsu!! she has 13.5k followers but most of her photos have 300-500 likes, and a lot even have 100-200.
which is a lot but inconsistent with her follower count
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Usually that means bought followers
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Those services are really good too, they make it look like real followers by running bots that take abandoned accounts and make them follow you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You can even buy “drip” followers, so that you get like 8 per day and it looks like you’re not buying them
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WOW
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooooooo. that makes sense then. i looked through and all the accounts seemed real. bots too advanced yikes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Accounts more than 1K should have a 5% or higher engagement rate
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): On average
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which means anyone who has less is probably full of fake followers
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But even 5 is kinda low, I think my engagement rate is 16%
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It’s really a fascinating topic which is why I’ve done my research lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): das pretty neat
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean the algorithm can also be blamed by
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But that’s usually for isolated cases
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think my engagement rate is like 20% but i know nearly all of my followers somehow
N🆗ri (Marisa): algorithms SUCK
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like my Pyrrha selfie got 1.6K likes, that’s 35% engagement, but my Ochako got 380 likes, which is more like 8%
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah they do, chronological feed is where it’s at
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's the population of a small town omg
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah it blew up for some reason
N🆗ri (Marisa): we'll name this town............. georgia
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's a good name
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe some day it'll be a state
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): YE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): My follower count grew so well like two years ago
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I got like 500 over the course of 2 months
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Now I’ve been stuck at low 4K for like a year I feel like
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah instagram is really weird like that, how people can just stagnate
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah like I wanna hit that 5K cause that’s when I can start getting free shit apparently 👀
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): From like company sponsors and stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia 5k campaign lets go
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've been hovering at 275 for like 6 months
N🆗ri (Marisa): my sister has more followers than me and she never uses instagram and has like 1 post from when she first joined i was like ? ?????
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i wanna hit 1k
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): georgia is good at posting
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): she always asks questions and starts disscussions
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _and then I will drag you all into fame with me_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I should try that
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah how do u get people to discuss because when i ask questions no one responds <:lenny:395307171539189760>
nono i'm scared i'll stay in the dark
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah asking questions is good
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll get more of those mean sinner comments
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): One post of mine blew up cause I got 60 comments but it was all people discussing popular myths and fairy tales
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh neat!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): id be afraid people would start da discourse
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i also have a hard time replaying to comments
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye that’s why you gotta ask relatively neutral questions
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im just like "idk what to say"
N🆗ri (Marisa): "what are you doing for halloween?" nada
N🆗ri (Marisa): halloween is cancelled
N🆗ri (Marisa): 😭 nvm that made me sad thinking about it
Dirty Lego (Tom): I was really excited to do insta in the beginning cuz I liked the whole follower analytics and engagments
Dirty Lego (Tom): Buttttt
Dirty Lego (Tom): I've grown quite bored with it and now I only wanna share funny stuff or stuff I'm like super proud of
Dirty Lego (Tom): So my posting rate has plummeted
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): post
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): show the world your beauty
Dirty Lego (Tom): But I don't want to that's the problem xD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): let me like it
N🆗ri (Marisa): a second private insta account where jess is the only follower
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): whenever tom posts i get excited
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tis rare
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its nice to see "tomukuncosplay" post content
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): LIKE THOSE CUTE JNPR PHOTOS FROM OTA
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): just shop marisas face over hals
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): speakin of, i was thinking earlier, that instagram followers really _do
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like everyone was posting stuff about how bubbly and confident meg is
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but like, idk, she got drunk last katsu cause she was afraid to wear yoko
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hal said she has seasonal affective disorder
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): she apparently doesnt believe in love and is afraid to commit
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i can relate
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _jess you believe in love dont say that_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but i get afraid to wear my cosplays and i have SAD too
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye all social media is super crafted and a lot of followers seem to forget the people they follow aren't manic pixie dreamgirls
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): confidence isnt constant
N🆗ri (Marisa): im gonna beat the sad out of u with a paper fan
N🆗ri (Marisa): softly
N🆗ri (Marisa): it'll have peacock feathers glued to the ends
N🆗ri (Marisa): naturally sourced
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but like im not gonna tell that to my instagram followers cuz its something im trying to imporve
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and having people think you are confident, kinda helps?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ye thats true
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): plus meg grew up a little chonky like me too so i relate with her on that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like my followers are probably like "oh XD thats georgia, dunkin fam, super flannel queen, space nerd!" which is relatively true but they dont see the "5 hours of sleep a night to get physics done" part
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its hard getting over that ingrained insecurity
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think some people post about how insecure they are
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but like, in a whiny way?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): if that makes sense
Bill: followers don't know you, they aren't friends. The appeal of them isn't that they care for you, but they care for the work you do. (Unless they a creep who thinks following means they get to make a pass at you).
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they do but i dont like too
N🆗ri (Marisa): das me im whiny
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): no not u marisa
Bill: You can keep fame.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like the ones that are like "im ugly, someone love me" on their stories
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no
I thought those were all ironic
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like o okay i wouldnt ask insta for that if i were you but sure, canvas for love on insta i guess
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ive seen people do that seriously 🤔
Bill: That's a terrible idea.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz like im trying to get more confident and people seeing me as confident helps me FEEL more confident.
and most of the time i am pretty confident but i dont wany my weak points to define me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so only people close to me get to see that because the KNOW it doesn't define me, where as outsiders will chalk up your whole existence to one thing in 10 seconds
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _how many people think i am just dunkin and flannel in a trenchcoat_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but ye its tur
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wonder if theres a psychology of social media course
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): alot prob XD
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): that would be so cool, seeing how people use social media differently for their own purposes
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee there probably is! we touched on it briefly in a few of my courses but it usually pertained to whatever the main topic is, like social media in times of crisis or how it impacts family or the population as a global whole.
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone somewhere teaches a social media sociology course
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah!
Dirty Lego (Tom): When I first opened my insta and started cosplaying it gave me a nice boost in confidence for sure
Dirty Lego (Tom): But idk if it gives me that anymore
Bill: There's something to be said for men not enjoying instagram as much as women.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its not really about "enjoying" instagram is about not being popular on there
Bill: ~~you enjoy being popular don't you~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): alot of men "use" insta but they dont post
Bill: People don't just like writing those long ass captions for the fun of it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they arnt active or they have meme accounts
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like writing the captions but i don't think anyone reads them
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my captions arnt long lol
Bill: There's no appreciation in the same way women get (which is of course a problem in itself) so  the effort becomes wasteful to them.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and if they are i probably actually wanted to write it
Bill: That's my theory.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but thats also sad
Bill: yup.
Bill: but I'd expect 90% of men on instagram can relate.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not that there is "no" appreciation its just signifacantly less
N🆗ri (Marisa): really? i've seen guys with a lot of the same comments that women get
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea thats why im saying its not none
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): youll see alot less guys getting comments like those than girls
or just number of likes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): appreciate your local cosplay boi today
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah I mean it just how it be
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's odd because slot of men don't put much effort into cosplay and go wigless
Dirty Lego (Tom): So you'd think the few that do would be heckin popular
Dirty Lego (Tom): But only a few hit those levels
Dirty Lego (Tom): For example I've never seen a male ashitaka with a wig despite my searching
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye, i think you have alot of potential though! your not afraid to wear makeup, or a wig or more feminine stlyes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you put in alot of effort ❤
Dirty Lego (Tom): Thank 🙏
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): alot of guys arnt as perfectionist as you either
N🆗ri (Marisa): i read that as "a lot of guys aren't as perfect as you either" hehe
N🆗ri (Marisa): classic jess
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): dawww
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~well haha, that too tho~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): 💕
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im serious tho! you're a great cosplayer babe!
Dirty Lego (Tom): Thank! Although I was mostly talking about male cosplayers in general
Dirty Lego (Tom): And my disinterest with posting
Dirty Lego (Tom): Maybe if I do a cosplay I'm super proud of and I get good pictures I'll get interested again
Bill: ^ ye. Tom is an outlier for the effort he puts in.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I still enjoy cosplay at conventions tho
Bill: Not to mention the 'if you lewd it you'll get followers' doesn't even work for men, Kamistry proves that.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah which is ridic
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): who doesnt like some good ol man booty
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i will say, i think eriks gonna get popular if he keeps posting his butt, hes starting gettin real into that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LOL
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmao, yeah, he's also rather charismatic at times
Dirty Lego (Tom): Hat helps alot
Dirty Lego (Tom): And posts oftwb
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he posts alot of memey story videos and stuff
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): erik uses instagram Very Good
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea hes good at it
N🆗ri (Marisa): So my cousin who’s getting married tomorrow is the older brother of the cousin I thought was getting married. Silly me. This older cousin was already married but I guess they’re divorced and now his ex wife an daughter live with our aunt in California, who flew to NJ with his daughter for the wedding.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I assumed it was the cousin who hasn’t been married. I should know better than to assume.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wait
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So your cousin's ex wife lives with your aunt? Like as in his mother?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not his mother, his aunt also. We have like 10 aunts.
N🆗ri (Marisa): He joined the Air Force or something and then got a girl pregnant so he married that girl but apparently it didn’t last
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So she lives with her ex husbands family? That's gotta be awkward
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yuup
N🆗ri (Marisa): The new girl is apparently rich though that’s why it’s such a fancy wedding
N🆗ri (Marisa): I just really wanna mess with people there for some reason
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Damn
N🆗ri (Marisa): Darn I’m not Facebook friends with my cousin so I can’t stalk his profile
N🆗ri (Marisa): I am with his younger brother and sister <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): We have a really big family so why do we add more “not related by blood but close enough” <:woah:543194447345876998>
