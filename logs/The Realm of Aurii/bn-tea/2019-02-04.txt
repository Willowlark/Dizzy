Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Leanna’s complaining to me about Hal and Meg
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): What a good day
N🆗ri (Marisa): Does she move near them? Yikes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Meg blocked Leanna from her close friends story and Leanna is like... why
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And after the misspelling on the last anonymous message, Leanna thinks Meg and Hal are teaming up against her
N🆗ri (Marisa): >:0
What the fudge why would they do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry for the strong language I am moody over spongebob
Bill: They’re trying to ship her and Erik.
Bill: While technically wholesome, they’re doing it excessively and both of them have dissuaded the insinuations and stopped responding to things.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And now Leanna says Erik got so frustrated he blew up about it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Those Delaware dudes are digging their own grave
Bill: I’ve never been on Meg’s close list I think but like. Hal probably has nothing nice to say about me either, and I wasn’t close to them before.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Leanna found out cause Meg posted to the close list “hey drama is starting so speak up and defend me”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Or something
Bill: Oh Erik blowing up sounds like a story. Imma have to bring that up next I see her.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And Erik saw the post, mentioned it to Leanna, and Leanna didn’t see it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean I imagine it’s just him emphatically dissing someone but I appreciate it nonetheless
Bill: Anyway who cares. It’s just just Instagram and Delaware group keeps to themselves. We don’t all have to be close in BNE. There’s been a lot of worrying about it and like? Let them do their own weird shit.
Bill: I’m quite happy not being involved.
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): mood
Bill: Zeikani is unique.
Bill: I have NO IDEA why I’m on her close friend list.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mood
N🆗ri (Marisa): U made it 🌟
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Huzzah!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah Leanna just said that BNE seems to want to avoid Delaware squad as much as possible
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which is, in a way, comforting
N🆗ri (Marisa): Who’s Delaware squad. Just greg and meg?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And Lissy even tho she’s been mostly neutral
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And then party guys
N🆗ri (Marisa): Who Lissy :0
Is she in BNE?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Barely
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But aren't the only 2 who actually live in DE meg and hal?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Brandon and Tyler live in PA I think
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Lissy lives in DE too
N🆗ri (Marisa): Greg needs to take that to nsfw chat
N🆗ri (Marisa): I hope my statement wasn’t too mean but that discussion is kinda gross
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LMFAO omg hal NO IT DOES NOT
N🆗ri (Marisa): What does jess mean she and Tom haven’t been married forever <:lenny:395307171539189760> obvious lie
