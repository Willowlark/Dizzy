Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): THERE IT IS
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~erik just summed up the fluffy bois channel oops~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i was buying gifts today and realized that a lot of the gifts i'm picking out are for people who i only speak to like once a year, or very very rarely. i wonder if they'd be creeped out by a present and if they even consider me a friend. hm.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): tfw bne doesn't care about you 🙃
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH NO MAWISA you had to get rid of all those magazines? D:
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sldo bne is kinda selective with what they actually respond to vent support dont take is personally i know alot of the people who you met at konkon last year are excited to see you when you come back
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah!! it's ok I still have over 40 that I have to recycle over the next few weeks.
i'm not too concerned, i've known since i moved here they'd have to get tossed, and also they usually come with freebies that I can keep (like pencil cases, stickers, pens, little things)
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ya i've noticed a lot of vent stuff gets ignored ~~i'm part of the problem in that since i also don't respond~~ but it's other channels too.
i shall shower those who are excited in green tea leaves
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the magazines I threw out today are kind of the trial run because i've never recycled books here before. I know how to in theory, I just want to make sure it works so i only put out 8 magazines
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think alot of the time its just people not knowing what to say which im also totally guilty of
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): wow how are you able to specify the exact reason something happens in a logical and reasonable manner
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): *it can't be that plausible of a reason. it must be everyone hates me.*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh trust me i can only do this when its other, when its me? everyone hates me
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the human brain is a wonder
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'll file down the edges of the gift i bought you today so if anyone hates you, you can cut them with it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OwO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🔪
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm too afraid to talk in general and break the chain

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YE
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): do you have one??
I was thinking of making a few when I get back. I don't know if I want to make a Ghibli bag or an All Might bag.
if I do make one I was gonna customize it, like maybe a totoro-shaped window for the ghibli one and either a peace symbol or the bunny-style hair spikes that he has
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nooo i dont has one myself but i see them alot
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): have you ever thought of making one?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the only issue is they're soooooooooo expensive to assemble
