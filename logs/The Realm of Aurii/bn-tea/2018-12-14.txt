秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ohh noo
I feel like that card slendergiant got with his zentai suit is kind of messed up. In an exploiting poor labor kind of way
Bill: Me: it’ll be nice to help cheer Leanna up from her boyfriend being trash
Also me: you’ve been on a depressing binge all week, how exactly you plan to cheer someone up?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Catfish her ex boyfriend
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): why are breakups usually so "never contact me again"? why don't people remain friends? is it because hanging out becomes too awkward? can they not remain platonic buddies with no romantic interest
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It happens sometimes
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But its usually wierd yeah
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Even if it was both thier decisions
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): why is it weird :0
especially if it was mutual
new partner may be jealous?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I think it's just because your mind registers them a certain way and it's really hard to stop seeing them that way
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Even if you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, there's the big chance that seeing them with someone else will make you uncomfortable
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the class i took on this subject was the one with the awful teacher who didn't teach and was fired midway through the semester <:rip:369476083248267274>
o that makes sense i guess
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): kind of like when a kid is jealous of one parent spending too much time with another kid
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like Jen and Rob seemed pretty mutual but they don't really talk a ton anymore
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): They are friendly but they aren't nearly as close
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Is this Mirai <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Similar but not quite the same
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It's more because of awkward ness
Bill: Feelings are uncontrollable when you care that much about someone.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): but that's a natural progression, people slowly growing apart. that happens all the time to everyone. with lovers who break up it's very immediate and that's kind of more damaging than slowly drifting apart isn't it
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And some people see it as thier past mistake and that's hard to face
Bill: You’ll be jealous even when you know you shouldn’t.
Bill: Definitely mistakes.
Bill: And god help you if your on the unresolved side of things, where you weren’t ready for it.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): hmm. if one person still cares that immensely for another woudn't they be better off with the other person being happier
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But yeah the most common is one decides it or cheats
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And niether of those end well
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): like my cat is the number one thing in the world to me. i leave her with BoJo because I know that's the best for her even though it tears me apart inside. if she wanted to go with another family and didn't want me and that other family could provide for her better than i'd give my cat up but also ask to still visit from time to time.

omg i can't understand cheating my classmate and his fiance both do it and I'm like ???
like an open relationship is one thing but they refer to it as cheating
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): he said he was with a girl once and he ran into his fiance with another guy and it was weird like *yeah that's weird dude*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that's world dude lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that's wierd dude
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Some people have that insane level of turbulence in thier relationship
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Obviously causes all sorts of issues
Bill: No one is that selfless. The other person may be happy, but the loss of happiness on your end, be it because you wanted it to continue or because it was good once and now it isn’t, is really strong. Uncontrollable feelings, QED.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'm staying far away form that
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Sometimes someone will threaten a break up because they don't feel like they are good enough for the other person
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But that's more of a self esteem isssue then relationship
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that makes sense. in that case the partner should stay if they really enjoy the relationship. yeah that's a self esteem thing.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): if a person is unhappy they can dig themselves out of it. it takes time. is there anything you want to talk about.

i might not understand just because i don't experience attraction and have never been close to anyone. but i've lost many friends and i'm happy for where they are now. yeah it stings and i'm sad about it but the world is big and i've faced much sadder.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I mean it's similar to friendship in a way, it's not far off
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): If you love a friend (esp alot) it's pm the same feeling, there does come a different kind of closeness with a partner this that isn't shared among friends usually
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Prob attributes to the higherarchy of needs
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He touch one
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Granted some friends hug alot and that helps that
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah that's the big difference. i'm trying to think how friends and lovers are different since i basically view romantic relationships as exclusive mega best friends.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Tbh really really close friends is very very close to the same thing
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): There is the exclusiveness as you mentioned
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): though unless something really really big and dramatic happens, best friends don't just stop being friends at the drop of a hat whereas with relationships it can be cut off in a moment's notice. mostly due to cheating.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah, there is a line there that's not in friendships
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Although I guess if you suddenly felt inclined to punch your friend in the face you might not be friends anymore either
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~is that why everyone leaves me <:lenny:395307171539189760>~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): There's also the human established contract of declaring someone your lover that gives a sort of security I think,and separates it into a different category
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Consrtruct not contract
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): unless there was a reason to the punch
yeah this all ties into social constructs and socially defined categories
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Pls there's the more primal side of you wanna get super deep into psych and the reasons we think things.

I never personally have agreed with that one behavioral scientist whose name escapes me
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): The one that thinks everything is decided based on sex
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): freud? yeah he's a bunch of bologna
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that dude
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'm sure some stuff is but that dude thought EVERYTHING was
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Esp his dream theorys
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): pretty much no scientist nowadays takes him seriously.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Garbo
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Thank goodness
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): in my classes it's all about social constructs
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I do believe that some stuff does certainly stem from that tho
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Just not the way he described
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah there's a very small amount of what he says that has some factual basis, but not for the reasons he thinks lol exactly
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And not TJAT OBSESSIVELY
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That dude really liked his phallic onjects
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I think I rabbit trailed.too much and lost my original point damn
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's cool how different societies and classes define their relationships
hhehehehe RABBIT HOLE RABBIT HOLE
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Relationships are def different from close friendships but only in a few ways
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): They share alot of the same feelings
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): relationships of the poor and the rich are very different.
in Japan, women stop being seen as attractive and become a mother figure after their first child. that's why cheating is so rampant in older men and hostess clubs are so popular.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the men still love their wives and don't want to break up, they just aren't hot anymore or something
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I could see that being a thing there yeah
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): but also in places multiple wives/husbands is totally ok. the wives are all close friends and don't feel jealous about their husband being with multiple women. so it's all social.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): socio-cultural
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): same with polyandry
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah although there always ends up being a favorite in that situation and it's something I have trouble personally agreeing with or relating to 😬 
It's theoretically possible but very hard in practice I feel
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): naw, not always. wives can be equally loved. not hard in practice at all, it's still done in the world
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): parts of nepal, china, india
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): africa and stuff
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'm sure it is, I do believe it requires serious emotional maturity, and could easily get out of hand.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): you're lookin at it from an american perspective ;3
imagine living somewhere where that was the norm. like rural china. 

the one child policy skewed the population because people favored boys over girls. so you have more boys in the city. so you start taking girls from the country to be wives. so now the countryside has many boys and no wives. so now you start marrying multiple men to girls. not strangers, usually it's brothers or cousins. Everyone you know has always lived like this since you were born. isn't a two-person relationship odd? isn't that not enough emotional support? isn't it lonely?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *shows up 6 hrs late* yea if definitely depends on where you grow up and your influenes how you see relationships
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the conversation don't end until the topic is changed <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> welcome to the chat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea yea! Relationships are pretty much like super duper extra bestest friends.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So I guess if you were raised with or excepting the multi thing then you'd just have more super duper extra best friends
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Yeah!! A lot about human nature and relationships that we take to be natural has only been around a couple hundred years at most. Technology has really made humanity different.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): people have always been people, ancient humans are the same as modern ones and no matter where on earth you go everyone is the same, but our society has many new expectations and moves at a WAY faster pace
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like I see why the multi thing works especially in other cultures. Butbobviously, me personally, I have a very monogamous view on relationships.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But that doesn't mean I don't think other people can make it work cuz it obviously can
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ye it's especially helpful in places where work is distributed differently and there's still a ton of household chores to be done. it takes a long time to make food and do laundry, just imagine not having a microwave or a laundry machine to do all that, so having multiple spouses is very helpful. also good for dividing up land and avoiding family disputes about who gets to inherit what.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea and I think there's usually alot of kids in that case? So it helps to have other people to help handle that's and all the chores
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ye!! some people have over a hundred kids that's freaky
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's terrifying
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So in China women have 2 husbands sometimes? I feel like almost Everytime I hear about it it's the other way around 😮
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah!! that's polyandry!! there are a few places around the world where it happens. not just 2 husbands, it can be a bunch. polyandry is multiple husbands and polygyny is multiple wives
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooooo ok! Imagine if I went to go marry Tom and they told me I have to take a brother too <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's done in india because people got tired of splitting up their farmland so they went "ok all my sons are marrying this lady so they all get the land"
<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> how many brothers he have
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 3 😂
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 4 husbands too many
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's also done for money reasons too. in a lot of places people have arranged marriages and sometimes the family can't come up with enough money to get all their sons individual wives, so they buy one wife for all of them (or opposite, send all their daughters to one guy).
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): or guys who are unrelated can also pool their money together. just bros buyin' a wife with each other.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I am fine with just the one (1)

So this is usually arranged right? Like it's not like the girl falls in love with in and gets 2 free
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Usually yeah. Or sometimes it is a love-one-get-two-free deal
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): In some of those societies it’s matriarchal and if a girl dies her sister gets the kids (and maybe the husbands? I can’t remember)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh wow see that's like a whole other factor you only chose *one* in which case it could be unfair to other two. The whole "favorites" thing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My great grandfather went to war and asked his brother to marry his wife if he died, so he would know she was taken care of which ended up happening
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Whaaaa
Oh yeah I guess? Favorites would come into play there. But they all become close over time. Oooo that’s really interesting
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But she never lived his brother like she loved him so she was always kinda sad about that
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): In one polyandry society I know of, husbands take turns claiming paternity of children. So the first husband is the first child’s father and the second husband is the second child’s and then the third child would be the firsts again and so on, no matter how genetics go
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Did he come back to her?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The brother? No he died 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): In the war
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The deal was that his brother would marry her if he died
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Oh no I’m sorry 😭
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Life sucks
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo yea I was wondering about that too, and like esspcially if they are brothers or cousins you wouldn't be able to tell much anyway I
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Yeah!! Imagine marrying twins that’d be weird
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Na don't be sorry I never knew them but it is an interesting story
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea with twins there is literally no way, I think even with brothers you can't tell? But I'm not sure
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think with brothers they could probably test and figure out which one is the father but with twins they can't?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Time for science
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ye identical twins have the same genes. There were a pair of twins that married each other (two twin guys married twin girls) and their children were biologically siblings but technically cousins
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHOA thats so cool
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~i used to have imaginary friends who did that~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): There was a woman who needed a maternity test for some reason I can’t remember why, but it came back false even though she was the child’s mother because apparently before the woman was born she had a fraternal twin she absorbed in the womb and the woman had the twin’s uterus
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Lewd imaginary friends
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHOA WHAT
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Yeah I’ll find the story
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats friggen crazy
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693&page=1
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): what a sucky situation she was in
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wow seriosuly
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sould you imagine need assistance and the governemnt is like "yea those arnt your kids" when you KNOW damn well they are
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "Fairchild was not only denied government assistance for her young children, she was now suspected of possibly acting as a paid surrogate mother and committing welfare fraud. She was in danger of having her kids taken away for good." 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): good thing afina's cousins here to save the day: 
"Attorney Alan Tindell finally agreed to take the case"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yooo this is nuts
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): she had to deliver in front of a court officer?! 😭  poor woman
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *literally birth child in front of them* 
"yea that's not yours"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH WOW Gen just posted a twitter thread about jealously in polyamory how fitting
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): omg yeah that's horrible, can you imagine "hey your kids aren't yours." "but i literally gave birth to them???"
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): gen reading your mind
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): basically it all comes down to communication with polyamory was the gist of it, cuz you've all agreed to this already (and like if you haven't all argeed that thats a no no obviously)  so you just have to talk it out when the little jealously pokes up. and it went into how you were saying early about "seeing the person you love happy is the real joy" so you have to take your jealously and learn how to be happy about the things you were jelly about
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): v. interesting. could never do it myself ~~cuz i am a jealous and possessive product of this society~~  BUT more power to all the people doin it
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): oo thats neat insight
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea! v. interesting
Bill: Already on record not being a fan or able to understand, whiiiich pissed off Rei.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): wow i loved rei in neon genesis evangelion
Bill: Reiley.
Bill: BNE.
Bill: The one with the long as fuck name.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you dont have to *understnad* just accept that there are other opinions and lifestyles that are different from your own, and that they are all valid
Bill: I know. To each their own.
Bill: I just don't get it, cause I could never do that.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): how else would you become a harem anime protagonist
Bill: ~~I can't become a romcom protagonist, how would I make it to Harem~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like for me personally, i get jealous, but i know its linked to my own insecurities so i have to remember not to blame anyone else
Bill: I've never even had a relationship ( 😭 )  and I know I'd feel the same.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): get a cat
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): no furry
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): just cat
Bill: Not really want I want, but as another topic I'd love to.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): naked cat
Bill: FURRY
Bill: But we're redoing a good portion of the house, and I wouldn't want to bring an animal into the house for it to have to deal with the floors being pulled up, kitchen being re done, bunch of stuff being painted...
Bill: Not fair to the animal.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no marisa said no furry
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): you could own a goblin they're cute

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): probably!! some of hers are at a special sanctuary now because they were deaf
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo maine coons are pretty af but they have allergens so rip
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): she knew something was off about them but couldn't figure out what until one day she accidentally dropped a pan on the floor while the cats were eating and it made a loud *bang* noise. half of them fled and the other half just looked really confused why everyone ran away
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): AW!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea russian blues are like one of the only breeds that posses less risk to allregy sufferers and still has hair
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): they're very friendly and social
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA! thats what i read

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): clouds are mostly water with no actual physical form
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh true

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): there are other hairy kitties with less allergens too but Russian blues are easier to get then some of the others
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i've always thought ragdolls were cool

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): idk why I chose my cat when we went to the shelter, there were lots of cats but it had to be her

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): she's very shy around new people, it's very very rare that she meets them so she's not used to people aside from me and bojo. when we had parties we'd put her in a bedroom or such until it was over.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): she's met my sister enough times that she'll sit far away and stare when my sister comes over and my sister likens her to an old jewish lady who plays cards and smokes cigars
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): apparently i've just now caused a big debate in another server but i haven't been in that server in ages

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): she follows me absolutely everywhere though. she was literally always next to me at home.
my 'bedroom' is the third floor but i sleep on the couch because the third floor is scary and uninhabitable a lot, but whenever i crafted stuff and needed something on the third floor where it was stored she'd walk up there with me and follow me back down and then sit on the sewing machine
