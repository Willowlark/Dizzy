Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Update Hal officially unblocked me from his Instagram story as well
Bill: You aren’t missing anything.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’ve woken up after 4 hours of sleep to call my family for Christmas but no one is responding. ;u;
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): OH NO 😭 😭 😭
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): WE'D RESPOND
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Maybe they have bad reception......
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Maybe :cccc
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I doubt there ignoring you in any case
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Unless they dunno it you
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): They probably know it’s me, I’m sending texts ~~and a Facebook wave lol~~ and they knew the texts were from me yesterday. A Christmas conundrum. 🤔
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Hmm they must not know then
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I told BoJo what time EST I would try to contact them so they should be expecting it, I’m hoping it’s just the bad reception. The house they’re going to is in a pretty wooded area.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): They have lots of deer there
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I like how some reposts of last years Konkon pics are, like, screenshots of the original picture so it’s getting low quality. I hope to see it gaining jpeg artifacts over time until one year it’s just incredibly deep fried.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): YESSSS
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i was able to call someone in the family! it was very short, i was hoping to talk with people but they just waved really quick and said merry christmas. was about 3 minutes total. i asked my sister if she got the package i sent her, it's being held at the post office currently but she sounded angry with me somehow. my mother got a letter the other day that I sent literally months ago oh no I hope the secret santa gift gets there in time. i wonder if I did anything that made my family angry? I don't know. They comment on my facebook stuff a lot but never message me or respond to my messages. 

on a brighter note i got a gift!! BoJo said she got me one of those gameboy sewing machines! yay.
Bill: I'm sure they aren't mad at you silly.
Bill: Holidays are stressful.
Bill: People just seem frayed after a while.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): when i return i'll use the gameboy to sew a hat that says "pls don't hate me" and pass it out at a family gathering <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
