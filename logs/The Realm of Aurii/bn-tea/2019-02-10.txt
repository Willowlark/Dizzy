Bill: *BNE all the time*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Too true lmao
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Nathaniel just messaged me “hey there” on Facebook messenger
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): With that whole drama from before I’m not quite sure what to say
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oof I hate when people just message hello or hey, or do the wave emote
Dirty Lego (Tom): Cuz they wanna talk with you but have nothing to talk about
Dirty Lego (Tom): Then it's awkward
N🆗ri (Marisa): hey there
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _i ignored it while I ate lunch but now what do I say_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Do I even answer?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t wanna be at risk for drama right before Katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): Messenger has read receipts right? So he knows you read it 😱
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe just an uninterested “yo”
N🆗ri (Marisa): Or can you wave at him
Just a Facebook wave don’t even say anything
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Huh he doesn’t know I read it cause I just had the notification pop up but I didn’t read it
Bill: Don’t talk to him.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I hate my cousin. 
Went to say bye to one of my aunts when cousin (not her son) walks in obviously high and starts rolling a joint. I said that was gross and went to leave and he told me “if you don’t like it then [censored] off.”
*what do you think I’m doing that’s why I’m leaving*
My aunts saw no problem with this and thought it was weird I was leaving.
Bill: Sounds terrible.
Bill: I don’t talk to my extended family so to me it’s like? The people who matter aren’t always connected by blood.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m calling Swat on everybody
