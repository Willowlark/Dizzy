Bill: I don’t get how you’re dating but not exclusive, at all. Like. If you’re investing them time with them, isn’t that because your interested? 

~~I should stop watching romcoms~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): From what I understand of people, the desire to do dirty deeds and the closeness of a relationship can be unrelated.
Bill: Not being exclusive doesn’t mean casual sex lol.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Like a more general poly relationship?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Dating means like, you’re interested in them but don’t know enough about them to commit as far as I’ve seen
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like you go on a couple dates to see if they’re you’re speed
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But you don’t know enough about them to really be like “ah yes boyf/girlf”
Bill: Cept people call that talking now.
Bill: Well. As far as I know.
Bill: I can’t really say can I.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Na ya dates are to see compatibility. They supposed to be very casual.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Two kinds of dates I guess? Getting to know person dates and then spending time together dates that come much later
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Gotta read more romcoms owo
Bill: Romcoms you just fall for someone.
Bill: That’s made more sense to me.
Bill: New girl is more fun now that Nick Miller is Peter B Parker.
Bill: WEEEEE I'm now going to dinner with Katy and Erik before Recess.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Without your parents?
Bill: yeah.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oof
Bill: I mean, I *shouldn't* have to call this tea, but I'm still just done with them.
Bill: But it's the holidays, so I gotta be nice, and I'm in the good light cause I told them I was going out. ~~They should have come to the damn bar, where I can mingle with bartenders as a break, but noooo~~
