Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I gots more tea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hal and meg are official now
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But he says putting his relationship status out there has caused nothing but trouble
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hal said “we need to talk, who’s been circulating rumors about me cheating”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I was like “same dude as always”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And he’s like “I don’t feel welcome in BNE, nobody talks to me. They chose sides”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I was like “idk many
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And he’s been silent all match
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _it is time to log off and he is stalling_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): me: "besides BNE, how ya doin?"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): him: /grunts
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): me: "depressed?"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): him: no shit sherlock
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh boyyyy
Bill: ~~Oh good more couples~~

The cheating thing is in his mind isn’t it? I don’t think we’ve ever really had confirmation people talk about it, and our group has only discussed it because we’re your direct support. 

More interestingly is the disjointed and lengthy vent. Props to trying to face the problem, that’s hard since there’s a big risk it could burn bridges. It’s um. Very hard to follow though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sounds like he was drunk or not in a good state of mind when he wrote it. Odd spacing
N🆗ri (Marisa): And it was over the course of 3 hours
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did he ever tell you he broke up over something from ANext? I thought he didn’t explain anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): Interesting how people have seen it and are posting in BNE but not commenting. It’s a lot to handle and break down.
Bill: He did.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone who’s a closer friend ought to comment first. For example meg should throw in her two cents and then whoever else is/was close with him before it makes sense for us to comment.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah I mean,I feel like we are in a different spot than most of bne because this has been her vent space for quite a while.
Bill: Cept he did burn quite a few bridges. I am physically unable to burn bridges and I got nothing to really say.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Also we know a lot,and I've spoken to him myself since then
Bill: Yup. And none of started any rumors so there you go.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I think it's more the general feeling in bne towards him
Dirty Lego (Tom): The few nights he was openly rude or overally sexual
Dirty Lego (Tom): The thing with Meg was odd.
Bill: I mean, Georgia was talking about how openly people kept distance. Rei apparently flipped him off a dozen time or something.
Dirty Lego (Tom): But it's all in the open now, I think what he said last night was good and it's something he should have probably done sooner
N🆗ri (Marisa): Last and only time I’ve spoken to him outside of aurii was at konkon so I feel out of place saying anything. 

Has his in person behavior mimicked his online behavior?
Bill: Being with a section of BNE probably brought his fears to life.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Nah
Dirty Lego (Tom): Although I haven't seen him in person since
Dirty Lego (Tom): Uhhh
Dirty Lego (Tom): A next?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oo a while
Bill: Chestnut hill shoot.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Right when was that
Bill: Also the last time Georgia saw him.
Bill: Late August?
Dirty Lego (Tom): Ahh kk
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'll go say something
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo tom goin in for the bite
N🆗ri (Marisa): So strong
Bill: Ye I need to read slowly but I admire what he’s done and don’t want him to feel burned for it.
Bill: Me: gotta really be from the heart, this’ll take time
Tom: Yeets response in 10 seconds
Dirty Lego (Tom): Gotta go quick if it's from the heart
Dirty Lego (Tom): No wasting time.boi
N🆗ri (Marisa): me: “cool story bro.jpg”
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wise words of tom
Dirty Lego (Tom): Pretty much, except a bit more positive xD
Bill: Fuck heart anyway.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I just don't want nobody to respond
Dirty Lego (Tom): That's no good
Dirty Lego (Tom): So I'm saying something at least
N🆗ri (Marisa): Especially when other people are posting in other channels. That’s heart wrenching.
Bill: ~~Some people will probably hold off on a response unless Georgia posts something~~
Bill: Because they have taken her side and need a “go ahead”.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Some yeah,prob just like Rebecca tho.
Bill: Erik and Leanna... maybe Hunter.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Maybe Hunter
Bill: Anna is a side taker, though idk if she in the loop.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I feel like Eric at least has sometimes gone against the whole group to make his point so maybe not
Bill: I’m finding in person he’s a lot more critical and gossipy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is Anna someone in BNE?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh wait yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): I identify people by their Avis lol
Bill: ~~we were also closer to Hal back when than any of BNE so if it’s just us willing to give him a bone that’s why oof~~
Bill: Ah there’s Erik. Switzerland rises again.
N🆗ri (Marisa): "working on our problems between us" kind of sounds odd.
did he mention him and meg being official in that post?
Bill: Not official but he told Georgia about them fucking.
Bill: Everyone’s known since October because Hunter saw it when they shot, he told Casey, Casey told Ethan, Ethan told Georgia.
Bill: Georgia told everyone else.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the circle of life
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hentioned something about being depressed on his story yesterday
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i read it when i first woke up but imma have to read it again
Bill: I’ve been depressed, haven’t been posting, you’ll see more of me in con season.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i mean the monologue no the story
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hal kinda always types all spaced like that though
Bill: you can't tell on mobile, but they're all individual messages.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i know
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hes always done that though
Bill: mhmm.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like hed always do stuff like this:
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): buy guys
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you see
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats not the way it works
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *explainations*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *more explanation*
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooooooooh that makes sense with the formatting. desktop doesn't show that either
Bill: yup. When I said hard to follow it's more he doesn't seem to have thought his concerns through. He just dumped everything at once in a bit of a mess before he makes his list.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea sometimes thats the only way to get it out though
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i want to say something but im not sure what to say? im feeling pretty shitty myself this morning so its hard right now
Bill: ♥
Bill: be like ":dab: ❤"
Bill: Anwar needs to fucking run one command and copy that output to me and it's been an hour and a half.
Bill: I literally have nothing else to work on.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Oh wow
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He really word vomited
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk if I should say somethin or not
Bill: If you do it's an olive branch.
Bill: But if you really want nothing to do with him outside of seeing each other at events, that olive branch could be more than you want.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah I really don’t want anything to do with him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I told him last night that it was his own actions that was alienating BNE because I kinda pitied him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He just sounded like a sad sack
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I felt like I kinda owed him the little nudge after he supported me for like a year
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I really disagree with a lot of his personal choices still
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Not to mention, even if I wanted to be friends, his life is way too chaotic now. He would need way more support than I think the average friend is willing to give
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Also he didn’t say Anext was the reason he broke up to ME, he said it was cause I was bossy and didn’t take no for an answer so I’m kinda miffed at that
Bill: Sounds like you should say nothing then.
Bill: I didn't think it made sense for you to.
Bill: From what I know.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~good job hal it took ya 4 months to clear the air you oblivious boi~~
Bill: Well then you're set.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): better late than never i suppose
Bill: If he was as depressed as you make him out to be, he probably didn't have the strength of mind to clear things.
Bill: Stop playing league with him tho.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He probably didn’t know what was going on
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I like the other people I play league with 😦
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think its worth getting on civil terms with him for the sake of common friendships
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t know how much of a splash his vent post made in BNE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Judging from what I heard at ice skating, people basically made up their mind
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Granted they were talking to me so that could play a role
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But he’s made people uncomfortable for a lot of reasons
Bill: And he’s trying to make amends.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): While the efforts respected, Marisa’s right, it’s a little disjointed and spread out over 3 hours
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t think he conveyed himself as well as he could have because I think he started writing on a whim
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he is... decidedly not good at communication. the fact that he said anything at all is improvement for him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s a definite truth lol
Bill: Yup. But to air all that tension out, at risk of us saying “yeah you do suck”? We could have easily confirmed his fears. That’s a HUGE amount of courage. Hell I’m avoiding something similar.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If meg said something too it might’ve made his case stronger
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): No one would’ve said “yeah you suck”, no one’s that harsh in the group
Bill: If he didn’t express himself well, I’ll give it to him because of how hard it was to do.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He may have that perception tho
Bill: No they wouldn’t. Be he’s afraid they might. ^
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah
Bill: Fears aren’t usually rational.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk it’s good he got it out there but I still disagree with a lot of things he’s done or failed to do
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): This is certainly the first I’m hearing that Anext is to blame, when he told me other things
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That aside, his communication skills are quite bad, because the impression he gave me with the break up is that he bailed at the first time of trouble
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): What’s even worse, that’s not the case, he was having problems since June and communication was so bad that he didn’t tell me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So if he can’t communicate well, that’s important to me, in friends as much as it is in relationships
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Nor am I interested in babysitting a lot of his more immature behaviors
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So I’ve basically elected to ignore a Hal redemption arc cause he’s not ready for one yet
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It’s like, I apologized to him two weeks after break up for being bossy, not because I had come to terms with it, but because I wanted him to take me back (eugh)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It’s good he owned up to what his personal errors were, but I had to point it out for him, and he may be apologizing just cause he wants to be on BNE’s good graces, he may not actually realize what he’s done wrong
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Anyways that’s my 2 cents I got internships for Spacex and the National Labs to do today
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if you never want to speak to him again then i think you need to tell him that because right now he seems to be under the impression you guys are working things out to be friendly
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s likely
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’ll deal with it after I’ve gotten all this internship work out of the way and school picks up again
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): 👌
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I FORGOT TO SAY THE LAST THING HE SAID LAST NIGHT
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): this is my last comment about this then it’s space time
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I made some passing comment about how we were both with people more our speed now, and we didn’t have to travel 2 hours every other weekend anymore
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And he was just like “I guess”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And then I was like “despite the problems you feel with BNE, at least you can take solace in the fact your relationship is better off”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And he said “if you say so”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which was WEIRD but I was so tired I forgot about it til now
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh noooo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk if it was depressed-speak or what
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so he is officially with meg now?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sounds like it maybe? When you’re depressed you don’t care about anything so maybe that made him overly passive?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah he said he and meg talked and they’re official
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I was just like damn thought you’d be happier about being official
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea...
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So, food for thought
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): /flies away to space land
Bill: Anwar wasted all my productive hours in the morning by not answering and I have no motivation to do the thing now that I can!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~i have cried like three times while writing my personal essay for applications, thats how you know its good~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you ok??? are u crying because it's beautiful. do you need a break
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i got 3 scholarships that way
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): no its a very good portfolio of the type of physics student i am and its very tragic because it talks about the events of last september
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like the opening is quirky and funny
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and then i talk about the Deep Stuff
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And now im talking about how i grew from it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and then i have to shove in a bit at the end as to why im applying
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ill show yall when its done
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ❤
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oof my brain is fried and i still need like two more paragraphs
