Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Defend Elfriede without facts
Bill: ~~if Hunter is crying as much as he says he is and it's *strep throat* I'mma judge him~~
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): he never accepted my friend request ; u ;
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i'm in limbo yehaw
Bill: Hunter hangs with instagram celebrities so he has that whole 'don't add me if you don't know me kthx' attitude.
Bill: I don't think he's as popular as you need to be to need that, but then again *facebook should only be for people you know to begin with*.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): yeah that's what i figured, he has absolutely no reason to add me so i wasn't expecting anything. i was just hoping to squeak by seeings as we had like 20 mutual friends
