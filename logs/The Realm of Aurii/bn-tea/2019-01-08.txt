Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): UGHHHH
Bill: Aww. Leanna sounded like she could take or leave skates, thought she might Kotori.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Uh oh
Bill: ~~only reason she was going is she didnâ€™t want to go home from Erikâ€™s and then down to Kotori~~ ðŸ‘€

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My battery is on 35% someone save me
Bill: *plug it in*
Bill: I messaged him about the album upload too, he's in the shoot.
Bill: Privately, because I have no need to be in group chat with you and him anymore.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't have a charger
Bill: o0 Why?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't bring my charger to work cuz normally I use my computer and barely use my phone
Bill: oh. I always have a charger in my bag, then one at my desk in NYC.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have another cord buts it's on the table at home so that doesn't help
Bill: But streaming music and tethering on the train for 2 hours kills my battery.
Bill: So it's always been a *need*.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I usually get home with plenty
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I do have a tiny on here but the cord is really short so it kind just has to hang from my computer
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oops NVM it's broken
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Interesting
Bill: I really didnâ€™t want to home tonight... the deal was Katy and I find our retirement accounts rather than pay rent. Katy hasnâ€™t been. So sheâ€™s getting the news sheâ€™s paying rent going forward and sheâ€™s not going to like that. Sheâ€™s going to get pissed and itâ€™ll be a three hour shouting match. These damn things tear me up and I hate them.
