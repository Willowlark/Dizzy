Elfriede Faun (Tom): HAHAHAHA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok so just a comment based on earlier discussion in the other channel. I wish Hunter would make galleries instead of dumping them in the server
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Same
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~or sending them over FB messenger where they lose their quality~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's hard to keep track of photos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Also that
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg isn't that like the exact reason this tea channel was created
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's why photato dump was made right
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like if hes gonna charge more for his photos... at least get the full resolution back to us
N🆗ri (Marisa): he doesn't send dropbox or file transfer or a zip or anything?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Nope
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I have to ask for the high quality every time
N🆗ri (Marisa): then yeah he shouldn't be charging that much if he isn't giving full quality :0
full quality is usually the bare minimum requirement for any paid shoot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Me: hey hunter is 12 available, him: no sorry meg booked me then, me: _of course_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The first picture he sent me of my Summer Lovin' bedroom shoot was over Facebook. The quality is somewhat decent and probably fine for Instagram, but the quality is significantly less than the rest of them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea he needs to start doing drop box or galleries or something because oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~and it was the cutest one imo~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Also oof Georgia....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He said she’s obsessed with critical role and he’s not so psyched for it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ooooooof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Everyone’s learned the trick that hunter shoots much better with things he’s familiar with
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Shes gonna get back bad photos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _nobody tell her_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Damn I wanted to get into crit role, RIP that pipe dream
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Nope 😶
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Though no one really seemed cosplayable to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t crossplay and there’s like three girls
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I want to get into it but oof the episodes are like 4 hours each
Bill: Hunters got some. Odd habits. I was completely against the dump channel in the beginning and I did at one point snark his lack of galleries. ~~Erik called me out on my frustration in dm good times~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I can't just sit and watch, I need to be doing something
Bill: I’m not a big fan of the way he does things.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I need to be doing something I don't have to concentrate too hard on
Bill: It’s got a podcast version.
Bill: While commuting. That’s my plan if I listen to it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Doesn't work when my work commute is only 10 minutes lol
Bill: *i don’t sympathize*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll probably save it for my roadtrip because Joey would want to listen to it too
Bill: Man it bothers me Hunter bothers me.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You’re allowed not to like people
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Bill: Oh it’s not a guilt thing.
Bill: It’s just. Stupid.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~that’s what I think when I want to justify salt at the Delaware fucknuts~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You’re mad you let him get under your skin?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I'm the same way Erik
Bill: I guess? It’s just stupid to have an inferiority complex with him.
Bill: Detaching photo requests from the idea of “confirmed friendship” should help anyway.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You want to have the freedom to edit photos as much as he does, you remark pretty frequently that you wish you had his schedule, that’s understandable
Bill: Not quite. I wish I had more time, but I want that time to do more photos. My ideal photo is one that looks perfect in camera.
Bill: Which is (I think) harder than photoshop mastery. To each their own of course, it’s not a judgement.
Bill: But I’d rather be out shooting, kick through the photos faster and faster, and keep moving.
