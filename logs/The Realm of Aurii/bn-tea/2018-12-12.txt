秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): So to mail the secret Santa thing I had to fill out a customs declaration form that has the present written right on the front lol
It also covers up the really cute envelope I chose darn
So if that can be peeled off beforehand that’d be cool. Or at least the gift crossed out when you get it. Sorry ;u;

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Aww that's great
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i just have this way with ladies who work at museums
the woman at another museum did it too. she would come up to me and tell me stuff about the exhibit yet not approach anyone else, and then at one point showed me to an unused room and pulled out a DVD player with an English DVD for me. it wasn't set up she went out of her way to put it all together for me and i was like *why are you so nice and kind and wonderful*

both her and the ladies from today told me about upcoming events and said i should return
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the women from today weren't even there when I left, i guess their shift ended and there was an older guy at the front desk by himself but when I went to buy a book he was like "the ladies here earlier wanted you to have this" and i was like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats amazing!
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): now i am obliged to return i am forever in their debt

the science one today was interesting but i almost passed out lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i like museums too! all different kinds
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the one lady was adorable too, when she started showing me around she grabbed a handful of notes, and at one point i asked a question and she thought for a moment and then started looking through the notes and they were all handwritten explanations of every single exhibit and i was like "woah"
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): museum field trip when
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i wanna go to the penn museum
does north jersey or new york have any cool museums
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): just no life science museums i might pass out oops

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA i've never been, my parents never brought me anywhere near the city XD
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): no fun in aurii
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the majority of museums i've been to are holocaust museums. yowza.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): big oof, although i would like to visit one. Ive heard its very emotionally taxing
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i might've gotten jaded by them since it was basically a yearly or bi-annually field trip to different ones, but yeah they're depressing. one of them, i think the one in DC? if not then the one in new york, assigns you to be an actual person. you get their name and their background when you enter and then at the end you figure out if they died or if they lived and if they ever got reunited with their family or where they went
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh wow yea that would kill me, but like, id do it
