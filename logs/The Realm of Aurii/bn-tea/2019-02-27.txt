Bill: So we know like, every person working at chili’s. It’s very much our local place and stuff. Managers come up to us to say hi, stuff like that. 

One of the recent ones is always wanting to shake hands and clap my back, stuff like that. Annoyingly so. Is touchy like that to the whole family but like. =/
Erik: ~*marks April 19-20 as "busy"*~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cries don’t leave me with them alone
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t even know what we can do
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I would probably lean towards just doing an escape room Friday night and let whoever sleep over Saturday
Leanna: Oof
Erik: Oof, escape room with Ethan... I can only imagine how that would go
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _we finish in record time because we WANT to escape_
Leanna: Is there a Hell escape room
Leanna: I feel that's fitting
Erik: That's just called spending time with Ethan
Leanna: Zhdhdhhdhdhzdhdi
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wat goin on?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Imlost complete track of what BNE is talking about
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): They’re spitballing ideas for a charity stream
Erik: We want to do some kind of charity fundraiser
Bill: Tell Ethan to fuck off. Seriously people.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I got that but what's going on April 19 20
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ethan and Casey are comin
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): Tell Ethan ur busy bring Casey to stream
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I kinda wanna just keep it to a Friday night only thing but people would have to drive kinda far for only a night
Bill: ~~fun fact I have strong opinions I just don’t share them to BNE as a whole~~
Bill: For the stream?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Friday night sounds like a good idea
Bill: And once again tell. Him. To. Fuck. Off.
Bill: You can’t ask for a welcome party.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Share! Share! Share! Strong opinions go
Bill: *I share them here Marisa*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Where they at
Bill: Everywhere.
Bill: Oh this wine is hitting me.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I meant Friday for just ethan
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo
Leanna: I'll gladly drive to you for a Friday if it means we have to spend less time "welcoming Ethan back"
Leanna: Because honestly I just wanna see Casey
Erik: I'd do a Friday night thing
Leanna: Casey deserves a welcome back party.... ~~maybe she'll remember how much she likes us and want to stay~~
Bill: She won’t.
Bill: Don’t let Ethan manipulate you Georgia you’re better than that.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Friday night escape room then? Minimize ethan time?
Leanna: Ye I'm good with that
Bill: Don’t matter to me, he hate me~~~
Bill: ~~shame I deleted the drunk discording counter cause this is a plus one.~~
Bill: Wow shit not eating carbs means I’m SLOSHED at three glasses of wine.
Erik: Meanwhile the dinner I made for the family tonight was literally all carbs lol
Bill: Well I’m a fat fuck and the only thing that works for losing weight for me is literally no carbs so.
Bill: ~~welcome to actual me I probably should have gotten drunk so soon after adding you guys~~
Leanna: ~~drunk you is good~~
Bill: I love you both, please don’t bust my “put together” image to BNE as a whole.
Erik: Of course not
Bill: ❤️❤️❤️
Bill: This is one way of dealing with the anxiety of adding new people to my trusted circle.
Bill: I’m sloshed on a Tuesday wtf is this.
Bill: ~~I’m out to dinner with my mother and she’s trying to set me up with a girl at the bar that’s why~~
Bill: ~~straight up saying “oh he’s into the anime thing” as an *icebreaker wtf*~~
Bill: ~~I’m justified to be drank drunk~~
Erik: Oof
Leanna: Oh dear...
Leanna: ~~to be fair, I had an anxiety attack yesterday after being added to this chat because I'm scared of getting close to people, so mood bill I feel you~~
Leanna: ~~I'm glad I'm here though, I love you all so much~~
Erik: I love you guys too 💕
Bill: Welcome to the family.
Bill: My inner circle is ducking great.
Bill: Belated, Leanna we care about you. Obviously Kurto, but I think I speak for all of us when I say we like you. Hell, love. Don’t worry about that fact that we do. It’s you being just YOU that we like.
Bill: Same to you Erik.
Bill: This group is... in my opinion, special. We’re tight knit and close, trusting and together through thick and thin. I am blessed EVERY DAY by the people in this channel for just being friends with me.
Leanna: IM GONNA CRY WTF
Leanna: I DIDNT ASK FOR THESE FEELINGS
Bill: I say that not to create distance, we feel you are someone we care for. You belong with us.
Bill: Please don’t stress that we care for you, both of you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What is going on in here? 👀
Leanna: Love fest
Bill: My friends are one of the best things of my life, and I’m a particularly blessed person. You, both of you, are people I count in that group.
Leanna: Also I'm CRYING
Bill: I’m drunk enough to be honest about how much I love people.
Bill: Don’t cry Jesus. That’s the whole point.
Leanna: It's so wholesome though
Leanna: I cry at everything, shotgun crier
Bill: Little did you know alcohol cancels out salt on the chemical level.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Biru go home you're drunk. Leanna we love you don't cry
Leanna: ITS GOOD CRY
Bill: I’m drunk yes, a block from home.
Bill: But I’m proud of my rational drunk skills.
Leanna: Drunk bill is so wholesome, I'm living for this
Erik: I like this group because we're fairly like-minded when it comes to things we're salty and bitch about 😂
Erik: But yeah you're honestly the people I feel closest to and most comfortable around in BNE and I'm honored to be included 😭
Erik: ~~why do I have to be so damn far away from y'all~~
Bill: WE RECRUITED SWITZERLAND WOOOO
Leanna: ~~move closer~~
Bill: Also yes.
Erik: I fucking wish
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WOAH I MISSED THE LOVE FEST
Erik: My target was to get a new job near the Philly area but even that's like 2 hours from y'all
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I wanna be Gey too!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I agree everyone in here is who I feel the closest with 🙌
Elfriede Faun (Tom): In bne that is
Bill: Come work in the New York metro arean
Erik: ~~I honestly just need to be further east regardless so Rebecca stops trying to bum rides off me for meetups~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Dave and Ashley are also here but they are shadows that fade and obscure. We are blessed by their precense once per millennia
Bill: Agahahahahaaaaaa lol
Bill: I’d say tell her know but she means well. You in a tough spot me popular.
Erik: Like, she's twenty fucking two. Gotta learn to drive long distances yourself sometime...
Bill: What a mood.
Bill: That was a lot of people I knew in college.
Bill: Fucking Josh.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121>
Erik: Uggghhhh fucking Josh
Bill: Fun fact number 2, I'm basically Chris Trager in the episode where he keeps trying to fix Ann's pregnancy complaints  and she just wants some to bitch to. I will attempt to solve *any problem*.
Leanna: If you moved to philly youd be 1 hour from me!
Erik: It would also mean I could just train to you guys
Leanna: I'm like in the middle of everyone currently. The most inconvenient spot
Bill: ~~Lets not mention the fact you want to move back towards sussex~~
Leanna: I do.... I miss my rednecks
Bill: ~~one redneck in particular~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ❤
Leanna: Ok I mean you right, but also everyone else too
Bill: Tom Jess and I discussed it, we're all going to move into one apartment complex. So we're all walking distance from each other and can hang out all the time.
Leanna: Sign me up
Erik: Same
Leanna: I thrive off of social interaction
Bill: ~~the real loser is the one whose apartment shares a wall with Tom and Jess's bedroom apparently~~  <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Erik: Also Bill, this popped up on my targeted ads Thot some reason. Might be of use to you? Or for drunk impulse purchase?
Erik: https://www.beulife.co/products/save-150-limited-time-z-flex-tilt-head
Erik: It's on sale for $32 (normally $185)
Bill: site not a trusted site, not going to put in the effort to figure out if I can trust it.

Bill: Jokes on you I don't even know my bank passwords.
Bill: They're cryptographic hashes tracked by my password manager.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So hack the password manager <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Erik: Shit I really need to change my bank password. It's like, my least secure one RIP
Bill: 
Bill: I'm as secure as the NSA.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Congratulations
Bill: Highly recommend a password manager to everyone though.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'll bet the password is 1234
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nailed it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The NSA password that is
Bill: far more secure to use a randomized password tracked by the manager than something you know.
Erik: Just changed it
Erik: And yeah, I've really been liking my manager

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 👀👀👀👀👀
Erik: Erik's advice: enjoy the freedom of being single (for now... it *does* get a boy lovely eventually), but for now enjoy things on your own. Go to a music festival or concert by yourself. Take yourself out on a date for dinner. Then get into a new community- based hobby and make new friends while learning to do something new. Never look back.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t even know what to say
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I just did things that made me happy and reached out to my friends for support
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That seems overly simplified
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): My advice was dispensed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 🙏 bless

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Or hal being nosy?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahhhhh
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Never look back 😏

Bill: *By taking extra notice of what they're doing and who they are with?*
Leanna: im a people watcher.... im very good at reading people and situations

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _why she been a jerk to me, is she mad she got my sloppy seconds_
Leanna: what she been doing?
Bill: Has she actively done anything to you in the last month?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): not in the last month but before that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): which is primarily any time she hopped on my ass in BNE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and shes stopped messaging me to chat/answering any of my instagram messgaes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): we used to chat like once a week
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~hal is the bigger offender but i lump them in together~~
Bill: Both Hal and Meg were very defensive on discord, especially when together because they felt we would judge them.
Bill: They still can be.
Bill: Meg just doesn't use discord.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah hal did try to jump on my ass after ice skating like "DID YOU TELL EVERYONE I CHEATED ON YOU"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like <:BOI:549661126141411351>
Erik: *No, that was Ethan*
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was so distracted by tea I forgot to put a tea bag in my actual tea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats the night he went on a feels binge in the vent chat
Leanna: o o f
Leanna: gonna be real, if they feel the need to be defensive they probably feel like they did something wrong
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i doubt that hal was unfaithful
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wouldnt be surprised if he found himself catching feelings for meg
Leanna: not so much that, but theres some guilt happening
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): considering they were up each others butts like a week later
Leanna: like i dont think he cheated
Leanna: but hes so defensive of this that its ...weird
Leanna: like making it into an even bigger deal than it was to begin with
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeaaaah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like people wouldnt have any inkling of it except that his demeanor is kinda questionable
Leanna: pretty much
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and it took him a long time to come out and dispel the rumor
Leanna: exactly, which i don't understand
Leanna: i guess my point is though, that you do have reason to be salty because its uncalled for for them to be so defensive and fighty. however it seems to have settled down a bit, which is good.
Erik: I like how you had someone in your Tellonym who was like *YOU AND MOBIUSMELT AREN'T TOGETHER ANYMORE?*
Erik: I saw the camaraderie between you and Hal during the Ethan bashing
Erik: Even if brief
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oh no someone was in hal's tellonym
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he tried to say we were on good terms at some point and i was like 🤔
Erik: I thought that too lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its like when the season 1 villain villain teams up with the protags to defeat the "Bigger Bad" okay thats what hal and georgia ethan bashing is
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): also i know tyler at least has probably been shitting on me with meg
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he unfollowed me and then was gossiping with them about how i acted at CCE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): which, give a girl a break, my parents had just finished their divorce, hal dumped me, and my grandfather died, in _one week_
Erik: Lowkey, getting Thai food with Tyler's group while dressed as Red Riot Thot was..... a bit uncomfortable
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): o rly?
Erik: Just because like... they're not the type of people I want to hang out with 😂
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah i cant do the party culture like them
Erik: Too party hardy
Erik: Can't do it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and tyler just absolutely shat on women whenever i used to talk to him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): granted those times were pretty brief but damn
Erik: I used to care that he didn't follow me back... but now I really don't
Leanna: oh same lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i remember brandon invited hal and i to one of his parties
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and hal and i had an anniversary dinner to go to or somethin
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but idk hal always wanted to get in with that party crowd
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wonder if its good as he had hoped
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~cause he tried to impress meg at RTX and ended up almost getting alcohol poisoning SO~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Erik: Smart boy
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was so fucking worried about him that night
Erik: When impresses a girl more than getting shit faced
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was half a country away and i couldn't stop thinking about how he was going to have to go to hospital  and ontop of that he was underage
Leanna: hal:  tries to drink as much as tyler, who probably already has liver failure
hal, after projectile vomiting everywhere:
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): well he wanted to do like 11 shots or something but ended up using a double or triple shot glass
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and THATS why the RTX group thinks i must be like a battlefield nurse at this point
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i was covered in vomit and hauling his nekkid butt into the shower like damn
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): forget georgia having fun and socializing, now shes gotta make sure her boyfriend doesnt die
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): for like 3 hours
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yo Tyler and Brandon are actually gonna die in like 5 years if they keep it up
Leanna: they really are, like im worried about them
Leanna: cause they are like..never NOT drinking
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea they gon die
Aldus Larian (Jess): like i like to drink but
Aldus Larian (Jess): not like that
Leanna: yea exactly
Aldus Larian (Jess): you guys are more my speed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): My dad had minor scerosis from 5 years of that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Not even
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 2 years
Aldus Larian (Jess): ☝
Leanna: Y I K E S
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I feel like their crew is half partiers and half people who wanna be cool
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like wolfdreamer is super nice but I know she’s pretty insecure cause of the drama with the NY squad
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She was tryna get with a guy that only wanted to use her for sex so
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I imagine she wants to be cooler
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which sucks cause I think she’s cool already
Erik: Like she's very sweet and I do like her, but I do feel she tries too hard to be "cool"
Erik: Like, I think she thinks she's BFFs with Jessica Nigri
Erik: ~~after I told her that she was at the Lobby Bar~~
Erik: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): The Greek™
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She and Sakura were besties before whatever happened at connecticon
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean I know what happened but it’s really convoluted
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _hey guys welcome to aurii we don’t normally gossip this much_
Bill: *Unless it's about Hal*
Bill: *Or Hunter*
Bill: *Or Ethan*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Or anyone that I hear about from otheR BNE people or the NY squad or the RTX peeps O O F
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): My New Years resolution was to be less gossip-y 😭😭😭😭
Bill: *Or a large collection of acquaintances in the con community*
Erik: *I say I don't like when people talk about others behind their backs but I actually thrive on gossip*
Bill: ~~We knew that~~
Erik: I'm a hypocrite and a horrible person
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You’re valid and I love you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Welcome to the shit circle 😂
Erik: Thank you 😭
Erik: Thanks it stinks
Bill: I respect the Switzerland approach to being a peacekeeper. I prefer the "I'm in change so if I say it's over it's over" approach.
Bill: Reinforce with *admin powers*.
Bill: ~~I have a thing for control~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~Leo~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I prefer to make friends 😭
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But sometimes I hear some SHIT and I’m like DAMN
Erik: Same tho
Bill: What does making friends have to do peacekeeping...?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I feel like peacekeeping pits your authority over everryone else
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The friend making approach is to present yourself on equal ground
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): IMO at least
Bill: I'm not... constantly peacekeeping. The first time I've ever had to in BNE was the other day, as far as I can remember.
Bill: I gossip just as much as everyone else.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): No no I know
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But even in that situation
Bill: Peacekeeping is a conflict resolution, not a constant state of being. I'm not *always* lording authority over people.
Bill: And further, I suggested as a member of the conversation first, not as an admin.
Erik: I'm honestly glad you took that step because I was getting really uncomfortable with the fact that while Casey probably doesn't read Discord, she had the capability to
Bill: The admin actions were to keep Casey from being hurt reading the messages, if she hadn't read them already.
Erik: And I was trying not to fuel the fire
Erik: Didn't do the greatest job, but I wasn't trying to be outwardly shitting on him
Bill: Sorry Georgia, I just don't like the implication that I'm not friends with BNE and instead just some kind of organizer admin. I know you didn't make that implication either.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Sorry I can’t type fast enough, I’m shoving food in my food hole before class
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean the make friends approach to conflict resolution as in just smushing everyone over to being in agreement with me so the conflict is over
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Sorry about the miscommunication
Bill: That. Can't actually work.
Bill: It was rather hard not to fuel that fire Erik.
Bill: Ethan is far too much of a hot button topic for BNE to ever discuss.
Bill: He's wronged too many people.
Bill: Too many people *put up with his shit still*.
Erik: ~*raises hand*~
Bill: I don't get that with other scenarios too. Not just Ethan. Why would people deal with someone who actively annoys them? Cut shit out.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Casey seriously hasn’t questioned him after he’s dumped her twice, and multiple friends cut contact cause they don’t like him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like if y’all left cause of Hal that would’ve been a hellla red flag
Erik: I've been getting better. Been trying to reduce my amount of interaction with him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 😏 tru
Erik: I regret offering to help with his business...
Bill: *Georgia agrees* ~~she better at this point~~
Erik: That's the reason I became friends with him
Erik: ~~that was my justification for dropping $5k on modeling software~~
Bill: Well. Think of it like this.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): His business was frankly him tryna become famous
N🆗ri (Marisa): does he still have his 'business'?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Lol no
Bill: If you didn't become friends with Ethan, maybe you wouldn't have stuck with BNE. Or gotten to be friends with Leanna. Or us, not as close as we are.
Bill: Don't regret cause it got you to where you are.
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Erik: Which I honestly don't regret too much. Like yeah it's a hell of an investment even if I don't use it that much, it's something I wanted to do before Ethan's business
Erik: Oh true
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He was just makin you his design monkey tho wasn’t he?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And not paying enough?
Erik: I forget what percentage he was paying me. I wasn't expecting it to be much. Just a fun side gig for extra cash
Erik: But he also had Nathaniel helping with that as well....
Erik: I get the pattern that he associates himself with shitty people
Bill: He uses people.
Bill: *cough*
Erik: Which makes me hope I'm not a shitty person
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Nathaniel was cleared of being a jerk at Katsu
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He just comes on REALLY strong
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tho Mel dragged Meg a big oops
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): YOU ARE MORE DEFINITELY NOT
Erik: Oh? Tea on Nathaniel?
Bill: pfft. You wouldn't have made into my circle if you were a shit.
Bill: Georgia's been holding out. =T There's the details on that Sakura tea David was on about.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Nathaniel wasn’t actually manipulating anyone, that was angryjigglypuff
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Mel said he came on a little too strong to Meg, but he’s not the pariah that meg makes him out to be
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Mel said meg is overly sensitive
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And Sakura was being an ass to the rest of NY squad
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So they kinda cut her out all weekend
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It is me, wezrez cosplay, hearer of gossip
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’ll let y’all know if I ever hear about you :>
Bill: The only way I would be possibly involved in gossip is because of my close relationship to you so...
Bill: That's not gossip you're going to be hearing first.
Erik: ~~Angryjigglypuff was behind Snow/Mist too I'm assuming?~~
Bill: That's what I thought.
Erik: I unfollowed her after she tried stopping bullying by bullying Snow in her stories
Erik: Then Nathaniel introduced me to her at RTX and I awkwardly said hi
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yup she was
Bill: ~~I don't follow people I don't know!!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She tried to throw me into the snow drama
Erik: And then she later started following me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She told Scott you can’t cosplay Maria if you’re white
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She crazy
Erik: Yikes
Aldus Larian (Jess): this tea stronk today
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): /opens coat "hey kids you wanna buy some tea"
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~ye~~
