Bill: So we know like, every person working at chili‚Äôs. It‚Äôs very much our local place and stuff. Managers come up to us to say hi, stuff like that. 

One of the recent ones is always wanting to shake hands and clap my back, stuff like that. Annoyingly so. Is touchy like that to the whole family but like. =/
Erik: ~*marks April 19-20 as "busy"*~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cries don‚Äôt leave me with them alone
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don‚Äôt even know what we can do
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I would probably lean towards just doing an escape room Friday night and let whoever sleep over Saturday
Leanna: Oof
Erik: Oof, escape room with Ethan... I can only imagine how that would go
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _we finish in record time because we WANT to escape_
Leanna: Is there a Hell escape room
Leanna: I feel that's fitting
Erik: That's just called spending time with Ethan
Leanna: Zhdhdhhdhdhzdhdi
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wat goin on?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Imlost complete track of what BNE is talking about

Bill: Tell Ethan to fuck off. Seriously people.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I got that but what's going on April 19 20
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ethan and Casey are comin
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo rip
NüÜóri (Marisa): Tell Ethan ur busy bring Casey to stream
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I kinda wanna just keep it to a Friday night only thing but people would have to drive kinda far for only a night
Bill: ~~fun fact I have strong opinions I just don‚Äôt share them to BNE as a whole~~
Bill: For the stream?
NüÜóri (Marisa): Friday night sounds like a good idea
Bill: And once again tell. Him. To. Fuck. Off.
Bill: You can‚Äôt ask for a welcome party.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Share! Share! Share! Strong opinions go
Bill: *I share them here Marisa*
NüÜóri (Marisa): Where they at
Bill: Everywhere.
Bill: Oh this wine is hitting me.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I meant Friday for just ethan
NüÜóri (Marisa): Ooo
Leanna: I'll gladly drive to you for a Friday if it means we have to spend less time "welcoming Ethan back"
Leanna: Because honestly I just wanna see Casey
Erik: I'd do a Friday night thing
Leanna: Casey deserves a welcome back party.... ~~maybe she'll remember how much she likes us and want to stay~~
Bill: She won‚Äôt.
Bill: Don‚Äôt let Ethan manipulate you Georgia you‚Äôre better than that.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Friday night escape room then? Minimize ethan time?
Leanna: Ye I'm good with that
Bill: Don‚Äôt matter to me, he hate me~~~
Bill: ~~shame I deleted the drunk discording counter cause this is a plus one.~~
Bill: Wow shit not eating carbs means I‚Äôm SLOSHED at three glasses of wine.
Erik: Meanwhile the dinner I made for the family tonight was literally all carbs lol
Bill: Well I‚Äôm a fat fuck and the only thing that works for losing weight for me is literally no carbs so.
Bill: ~~welcome to actual me I probably should have gotten drunk so soon after adding you guys~~
Leanna: ~~drunk you is good~~
Bill: I love you both, please don‚Äôt bust my ‚Äúput together‚Äù image to BNE as a whole.
Erik: Of course not
Bill: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Bill: This is one way of dealing with the anxiety of adding new people to my trusted circle.
Bill: I‚Äôm sloshed on a Tuesday wtf is this.
Bill: ~~I‚Äôm out to dinner with my mother and she‚Äôs trying to set me up with a girl at the bar that‚Äôs why~~
Bill: ~~straight up saying ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs into the anime thing‚Äù as an *icebreaker wtf*~~
Bill: ~~I‚Äôm justified to be drank drunk~~
Erik: Oof
Leanna: Oh dear...
Leanna: ~~to be fair, I had an anxiety attack yesterday after being added to this chat because I'm scared of getting close to people, so mood bill I feel you~~
Leanna: ~~I'm glad I'm here though, I love you all so much~~
Erik: I love you guys too üíï
Bill: Welcome to the family.
Bill: My inner circle is ducking great.
Bill: Belated, Leanna we care about you. Obviously Kurto, but I think I speak for all of us when I say we like you. Hell, love. Don‚Äôt worry about that fact that we do. It‚Äôs you being just YOU that we like.
Bill: Same to you Erik.
Bill: This group is... in my opinion, special. We‚Äôre tight knit and close, trusting and together through thick and thin. I am blessed EVERY DAY by the people in this channel for just being friends with me.
Leanna: IM GONNA CRY WTF
Leanna: I DIDNT ASK FOR THESE FEELINGS
Bill: I say that not to create distance, we feel you are someone we care for. You belong with us.
Bill: Please don‚Äôt stress that we care for you, both of you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What is going on in here? üëÄ
Leanna: Love fest
Bill: My friends are one of the best things of my life, and I‚Äôm a particularly blessed person. You, both of you, are people I count in that group.
Leanna: Also I'm CRYING
Bill: I‚Äôm drunk enough to be honest about how much I love people.
Bill: Don‚Äôt cry Jesus. That‚Äôs the whole point.
Leanna: It's so wholesome though
Leanna: I cry at everything, shotgun crier
Bill: Little did you know alcohol cancels out salt on the chemical level.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Biru go home you're drunk. Leanna we love you don't cry
Leanna: ITS GOOD CRY
Bill: I‚Äôm drunk yes, a block from home.
Bill: But I‚Äôm proud of my rational drunk skills.
Leanna: Drunk bill is so wholesome, I'm living for this
Erik: I like this group because we're fairly like-minded when it comes to things we're salty and bitch about üòÇ
Erik: But yeah you're honestly the people I feel closest to and most comfortable around in BNE and I'm honored to be included üò≠
Erik: ~~why do I have to be so damn far away from y'all~~

Leanna: If you moved to philly youd be 1 hour from me!
Erik: It would also mean I could just train to you guys

Leanna: I do.... I miss my rednecks
Bill: ~~one redneck in particular~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ‚ù§

Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'll bet the password is 1234

Erik: Erik's advice: enjoy the freedom of being single (for now... it *does* get a boy lovely eventually), but for now enjoy things on your own. Go to a music festival or concert by yourself. Take yourself out on a date for dinner. Then get into a new community- based hobby and make new friends while learning to do something new. Never look back.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don‚Äôt even know what to say
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I just did things that made me happy and reached out to my friends for support
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That seems overly simplified
