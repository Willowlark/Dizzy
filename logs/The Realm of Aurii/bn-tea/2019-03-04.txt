Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye but you’re limited by a full time job
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the schedules of your friends
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hunter shoots with WHOEVER and only has class and a job as a delivery boy
Bill: Yeah. The time would be neat. I’d be bored cause of the other people’s schedules thing.
Bill: Issues not with Hunter, I just gotta have more pride in my photography and be happy with it. Just cause I’m not having my door knocked down to photos for RTX famous people I’m not *worse*. That’ll help. My friends aren’t going to ditch me cause there are better photographers either. ( 👀 )
Bill: Though, tangentially.
Bill: He’s being fairly insistent with his open bookings. Think he’s not getting as much reach as he thought he would?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Zenkai is smaller
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He probably feels the pressure too because this is paying for his top surgery
Bill: Mmm.
Bill: He hasn’t shared to the Zenkai groups tho.
Bill: So he must be trying to stay within friends still.
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's made public stories on insta tho
Bill: True true.
Bill: I imagine he’ll get more clients out of Facebook Zenkai groups though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's been 4 years since i've seen show by rock but i don't recall them being that similar to kiribaku 😱 unless it's the english dub doing that?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~shes projecting, its what she does~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): nothing wrong with that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but thats what shes doing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _omg every time i boot up league, hal does the same_
Bill: Unfriend him on league.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No I see it in the discord client
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I log on, he’s not playing. I’m in a game and then finish. And I see he’s playing! Like wot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): notice, i have stopped playing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): as has he
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://giphy.com/gifs/highquality-incredibles-coincidence-7GcdjWkek7Apq
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OwO?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Was that just out of nowhere?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeaaah
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~ulterior motive?~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Probably trying to get people to side with her on some drama that's a brewin
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Get out your 10ft pole
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://giphy.com/gifs/star-wars-hoth-PcUBIh8yyUvss
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): me keepin the drama away
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): loL WHAT IM HEARING MORE TEA FROM SCOTT?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh geez Lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): About her?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ERIK can you confirm that the darling group was smoking weed half naked while playing mario kart w h a t
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): scott said he felt awkward cause he was just in jeans and a tshirt
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): HALF NAKED
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> ???
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): By half naked, he means half in cosplay
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which was basically leotards
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh thank god
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it wasnt some kinda secret hippie commune
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, Lissy put a hoodie on
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think Scott let Haley wear his sweatshirt or something
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But yesh weed and Mario Kart were involved
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the half naked part was the more concerning part
Bill: * standard fare for that group
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's illegal though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We were taking a break between con floor time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So like, de-mech, chill for a bit, then re-mech and go back out on the con floor
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ok so tall didnt start a nudist commune
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yall*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): No
Bill: Still accurate.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Lmao, no longer concerning
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): more like standard con fare, with drugs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Scott was just chilling with us dressed like a normie
N🆗ri (Marisa): it shouldn't even be possible to have drugs at a con
Bill: There’s still something I don’t... trust about Scott. I know it’s just me and it’s not a malicious thing I’m feeling... but I tend to trust my gut and it doesn’t like him.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't wrap my mind around it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean scott complains about how meg feels like a fake friend to him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but he hangs with her anyways
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~though his proximity to the darlifra group is explained because he has an affinity for a member...~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like Scott but I also sometimes get weird vibes from him
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~is it Haley~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He likes start doesnt he
Bill: Haley?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Starry
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oop it was obvious
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Bill: Glad that was obvious to all parties.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It was *very* obvious
Bill: She has a boyfriend though?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he was alone with me at one point and went "oh man. hal was cuddling haley. i was like. fuck you man"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah he knows
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~who doesnt like her though?~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but he still likes her ofc
Bill: ~~and lives across the country~~
Bill: Rip. That’ll drum up some sympathy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): super obvious owo
i wonder if she knows because they were playing that unicorn game
she invited me to sit with them while they played
Bill: But still. Just. Get an off feeling.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Remember "Who's Erik's crush?" from last year?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OOOOOH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OMG
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~it was Haley~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hes got typical anime con "I'm such a good boy please notice me" vibes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): IM LEARNING SO MUCH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH YEAH DEF
Bill: Ooh, kinda that.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THE ILLUSION IS SHATTERED
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): does she cosplay rwby owo?????? is she a human????? is she alive?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): those asks were so interesting to see you answer erik
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She's really cute when she exists
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im having a heart attack
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this is too much information for me to process
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Loooooool
Bill: She’s very nice, but. You and Scott were like squading up and I was like “I’ll leave this to obviously in love Scott”.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://giphy.com/gifs/dead-help-me-qErN8xhr7Nfag
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah he invited her to dinner with the texas peeps
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh lawd
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Fam, shes got a bf 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I'm kinda over it. Like she's still hella cute and super sweet, but like distance and an existing bf
Bill: Love is blind and stupid.
Bill: QED.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I accidentally admitted to her at the ball that I had a crush on her a bit ago
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And it was just a scream battle
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im wheezing
Bill: ~~damn this girl a weapon of mass destruction~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And then I like had to take a lap to recover
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): she does have that senpai aura
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg im dying how do so many people have had a crush on the same person
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): shes a kind person but i feel like this is the spiderman meme of crushes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It basically is
Bill: Hey kid.
Bill: Remember the old “list joke”?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: Same energy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): fake news
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How could anyone *not* be crushing on her?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _is it cause shes touching a taiyang arm erik_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): MOOD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _is it_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): shes making star guardian lux oooo
Bill: Speaking of love and stupid, the comment about cuddling Hal I assume related to a cosplay pose? Kurtis learned doing cosplay photos with someone you got feelings for is a danger zone at your place and I was like “this is adorable and relatable”.
Bill: So pure. So good.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Wot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): nah hal cuddled haley cause he just... idk? they were chillin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ended up being like...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): A cuddle orgy at one point
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): HIIIIGHHH WAAAYYY TOOO THE DANGER ZONE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~stupid stinkin hal~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): im torn i wanna cosplay show by rock but it's them
Bill: Hella danger zone. Crushes looking all good and anime in your immediate proximity, often alone? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): solution: never crush <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: T R U T H
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~date someone who doesnt cosplay~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): live alone forever <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Danger zone is a good thing if it actually works out.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): two types of people
Bill: Also cuddle orgy sounds... lewd but also like... soft.
Bill: I don’t trust it but yet it sounds so inviting.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont trust anything when too many limbs become involved
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@301927856240459777> also a mood. Show by Rock would be fun to cosplay, but...
N🆗ri (Marisa): it sounds potentially fun but having never cuddled also extremely awkward
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mawisa i cuddle u
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~but you dont wanna get third wheeled?~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): GRJEJDJJXBDBDN
N🆗ri (Marisa): i pay two chicken tenders and a diet soda
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): PERFECT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL
N🆗ri (Marisa): woah discord lag :0
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i wonder how long theyd go back and forth in general if no one stopped answering
N🆗ri (Marisa): lets find out for science
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm fascinated with how quickly they've gotten attached in one episode
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and here hunter said she was obsessed with critical role
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if they hate it by season 2 they goin' so fast
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *left on read*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im love u erik
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~didnt you know "going too fast" is how these two operate~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hal keeps wanting to do group things with me. Line, he wants to do a lewd version of Denki with the Alice in Wonderland dress Starry gave him and wants to lewd it up with me and I'm like <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Y I k e s
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, that dress is comically small on him to the point where it really just looks even stupider than it's supposed to
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): not gonna lie, hes probably feeling detached from BNE cause no one talked to him at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and sucking people into groups is how konkon worked
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its how georgia-ing works cause i dont like shooting alone aha.....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so hes probably like oh if i do that ill be liked
N🆗ri (Marisa): they hadn't even finshed the first episode wot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They're still going at it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its kinda funny at this point
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Omg lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and yeah he saw your red riot thot was so popular
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and he _wants to be popular_
Bill: He’s never wanted to be popular imo.
Bill: He does want to have friends that he doesn’t feel guilty about.
Bill: And I won’t fault him in that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): rom has an office job do they know that. i don't think they know that because they've only seen one episode
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean he wants that but also
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hes said "i would like to be popular" when we dated so
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And it wasn't even *that* popular. It's not like I was getting stopped every five minutes for pictures. I had maybe like 2 or 3 people ask for a picture the entire 5 hours I was wearing it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~he wants to be you erik~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woah I blinked and missed so much tea
Bill: Was just wondering where you were.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Never close your eyes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was worried they stopped talking but there hal goes again
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have legit don't nothing all day, I find something to do and then you guys do this to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): gomen jess 🙏
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its just about scott and haley and meghal
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so its not really anything too new
Aldus Larian (Jess): I read it all now I'm not bothing catching up in BNE tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): No need
Bill: There’s nothing actually interesting. Meg and Hal are getting into a new show.
Bill: They’re talking about it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): were waiting to see how long theyll go back and forth
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its been about 15 mins
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's all Dem nakie bois
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): these fake bakus and kiris
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~it is a pretty fun show from what I've watched but like, I still probably won't *actually* cosplay from it~~
Bill: ~~there’s nothing wrong with sharing their interest in a public channel~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its kinda enthusiastic for not even finishing episode one tho 🤔
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's because Meg likes it
Bill: That’s who they are. Oddly hype and impulsive.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So Hal automatically likes it
Bill: Let them be, it’s not hurting anyone.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): True
Bill: Hal’s a bit of a sponge yes.
Bill: Probably why he wanted to be popular back then. Gf is, so I should be.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): not gonna lie, but objectively, i think hal wants to be in the spotlight but he just has something holding himself back
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he was in his last girlfriends shadow so i heard, guess he got stuck in mine, now megs probably
Bill: Well, he’s Zen so.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ahsjdjsks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): me too erik
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~whoa let's not insult zen like that~~ but ya
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hal is by nature a follower, you cant really be in the spotlight if you're always following others and never making your own decisions
Bill: That’s a fair assessment. It would imply he needs to focus on him and not others, build up who he is alone first.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so his personality conflicts with his aspirations?
Bill: Yup.
Aldus Larian (Jess): He simultaneously wants to be the center of attention to but also needs to be led
Bill: Shit luck buddy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): fair assessment for sure
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that explains the RTX incident...
N🆗ri (Marisa): What’s that <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The alcohol poisoning?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): illegal activity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the alcohol overdosing yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he wanted be the cool guy drinking everyone under the table
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but he physically couldnt take it and let someone else tell him how much  to drink
Bill: I’d. Encourage them sharing with BNE so they don’t feel like outcasts (important for the overall health of the server) but I. Can’t related to comments like “big gay energy”.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): intrinstically i know we shouldnt make them feel like outcasts
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~yikes I thought I was whiny and attention seeking but I just want to be noticed pls don’t drink ever for attention~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): emotionally im like shrug
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no mawisa we love you, you just have to ask if we do
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok so actual tea about that which proves Georgia is a saint
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea like I'll talk to them and stuff on the server, but... I dont really plan to hang out anytime soon lmao
Bill: You can feel that way. You don’t act on it (be openly dismissive or something), and everyone else can pick up slack.
Bill: It’s just the server that matters.
Bill: I ain’t going to Delaware for shit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): But 0% sales tax
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~If I'm going to DE it's for Maggie and topher, not them~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Meg was talling about that incident at one point and the way she basically said she just handed him off to Georgia to take care of him pissed me off
N🆗ri (Marisa): Her problem now tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like,  "not my problem, heeeeeeere you go Georgia"
Bill: ~~he’s his own problem~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also said she wouldn't do the same for him now that they're together
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wow that is horrible
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So bless you Georgia for being a hell of a girlfriend
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Holy shit she said that????
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Even if you feel that way ... dont admit that???? It sounds so horrible
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Especially since she handed him off to Georgia who she knew would take care of him. Like are you for real? Do not SAY that
Bill: Switzerland is a safe country.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Something to that extent. I could be misremembering but basically she said something about if he does that it's her problem now and then either she *wasn't* going to take care of him, or he's just not allowed to do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): If a friend is experiencing bodily trauma you help them that’s the natural thing to do
If it’s someone close to you you do it no questions asked so if they’re dating that’s like a requirement
Bill: A good friend stops them from being self destructive.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea... you cant just leave them
N🆗ri (Marisa): You aren’t dating someone’s good qualities you take the good and the bad
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I mean you right bill
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But if it goes further
N🆗ri (Marisa): But it sounds like Georgia wasn’t there when he was drinking?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): You cant just go " nope not dealing with this"
N🆗ri (Marisa): ^
Bill: She was.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Man I hope you remembered wrong
N🆗ri (Marisa): O?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'll give her the benefit of the doubt here
Bill: No. But I know I couldn’t deal with a vomit soaked person. Too much ocd.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same just because I'd start throwing up too
Bill: Yeah.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): If that person was at risk of choking on their own vomit though... like you gotta at least get them help
N🆗ri (Marisa): Then you’re in together
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like that's really dangerous
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m sure the person puking their guts out won’t mind if you’re also barfing if you’re helping them
Bill: Which is why I’d rather watch and cut someone off.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea like..not exactly a time to think about yourself
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I know. I also just like, wouldn't know what to do in that situation
Bill: Health risks is not cleaning them off and putting them to bed.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I mean if you cant take care of them, ambulance
Bill: ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): I only have experience with this when alcohol is long out of the picture or when alcohol wasn’t even involved so if it can be stopped then yeah totally but a lot of times it can’t
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): True
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Not necessarily you that has to help them, but you have to make sure they get help from someone who can deliver
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Which is what she did at rtx with georgia.
Bill: That’s a given ye.
Bill: Sorta.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And again, result of shitty healthcare system, nervous about calling an ambulance because they're fucking expensive
Aldus Larian (Jess): This is why I don't drink with people I can't trust 😂
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Bill: ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's the big whomp. us healthcare sucks
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Big mood
Bill: I did not give Hal booze anytime he was with us.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my carrot is because everyone else was carroting. let the record show that. i don't drink.
Bill: Never trusted him.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Solidarity
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn tomorrow doesn't support or encourage drinking and still takes care of my drunk ass
N🆗ri (Marisa): good thing you never drink ever
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOW WHAT A CUNT WAFFLE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I actually saved hal from choking on his vomit in his sleep
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And we were all in the same room, I just talked to other people, not realizing that hal was poisoning himself
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My ex once got heavily intoxicated, ended up puking out the side of my car on the way home, tried to take a shower and passed out naked in the bathroom. Had to call an ambulance (after calling my parents to make sure this was an ambulance worthy situation). She ended up stopping breathing like twice at the hospital
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): God what a bitch
Aldus Larian (Jess): Holy fuck
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It was a really rough night after what was supposed to be a cute date night
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh wow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not your ex (though also your ex)
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's scary
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah that’s intense
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow I can’t believe meg SAID that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And after the nurses escorted me out of her room to bring a crash cart in, I was waiting in the lobby freaking out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which upsets my stomach so I had to take a shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And missed when they called me back in which put her in a panic because she thought I left her (because I had removed the engagement ring after the bar so it wouldn't get lost or flushed down a toilet)
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooooooof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I waited for a long time before I finally asked if anyone had come back looking for me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I was in such a panic at the start of all of this that I didn't grab her a change of clothing
Aldus Larian (Jess): What a mess
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So like, I very much was not prepared for that situation
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you did all the right things considering the circumstances tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): which is, the hospital visit
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn wtf did she drink
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just felt awful about the whole thing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She started with some cocktail and then moved onto a "crowler" which is like a giant fucking can of beer, equal to about 3 beers by volume and was like an 11% beer on top of that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooooooo nooooo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _god i am so fired up now_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She did not do alcohol well
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *she's someone else's problem now, so good luck buddy*
Bill: Hehe.
Bill: That’s a growler Erik.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): listen i may be annoyed with hal about basically everything he has done and will do ever
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but thats a serious red flag when a partner refuses to care for you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): No it was a crowler
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm with you Georgia. Like that's so fucked...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 32oz can
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye they different
Bill: What is this strange thing.
Bill: Never heard of it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea that's fucked
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's a craft beer thing apparently?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /screams
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ya know thats actually about how it went
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hal was sloshed and he was like "im gonna go find georgia"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and he started googling symptoms of alcohol poisoning before he blacked out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and meg actually ended up just leaving the party
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i got vomited on .-.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~did he take his contacts out~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg too soon
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea no that's fucked up... Like sorry but if the person you are with isn't willing too look after you then wyd
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that relationship gonna implode baaaad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ogm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i cant stop thinking about how fucked up that is
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's even more fucked up cuz she encouraged it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "haha yeah id get hal so drunk he might die but i wouldnt take care of him!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): She drinks too, it's not like she's sitting there like "drinking is bad and if u do it I'm not help you deal with the consequences"
Aldus Larian (Jess): She's like "yea get fucked up!!'
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She encouraged him and then once it got scary she handed him off to Georgia
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Which in itself is fucked too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She shouldve at least like made sure he was ok since she was one of the people encouraging him to drink so much
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she told him the triple shot glass was okay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): meaning he took 27 shots
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nope nope nope
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Meg: ~*hands off a drunk Hal*~ "Here you go!"
Georgia: "Thanks, I hate it"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /proceeds to spend 3 hours getting vomited on, throwing clothes and sheets in the dryer, and hauling a passed out hal into the shower to wash the vomit off
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oof to everything I just read
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was in a swimsuit at one point to try to take care of him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then tim and peter had to help me, it was a mess
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Wow....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and its probably the reason the RTX group has respecc for georgia now hahaaaaa.......
Aldus Larian (Jess): And then he bragged about it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HE DID
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea.....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "haha yeah 27 shots and i didnt die!"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): As if that's something to be proud of
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He literally could have died
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Wow, Meg will think I'm so cool"*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yikes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it was literalLY THAT SCENE FROM BREAKING BAD WHERE THE GIRL DIES CHOKING ON HER VOMIT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AND I ROLLED HIM ONTO HIS SIDE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh God
....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _like identical scene_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's terrifying
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it was
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the first 20-30 minutes was pretty adrenaline fueled because he was spewing vomit everywhere
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and breathing weird and collapsing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok tmi but the worst was when he used the bathroom and tHEN vomited
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that was... somethin else
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho im proud of myself of handling such an intense scenario?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've had that happen with a stomach bug. Not fun
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Actual saint, Georgia Sandidge
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thank
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah that sounds awful 😔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so,.......... bets on hal and meg lasting longer, accepting wagers now
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hey they might just be in a loveless relationship for years too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): There's always hope right
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof
Elfriede Faun (Tom): "I don't believe in love."-  Meg 2018
Aldus Larian (Jess): Meg: I don't believe in love
Hal: sign me the fuck up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): meg: i dont believe in love and will leave you to die if you drink too much
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Meg: he can choke on his own vomit if that happens again
Hal: what a woman 😍
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hal: hawt shit :/
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): JDJDHBXBFBFJF9
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAOAOOSOOOOOO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ASDFGHJKL
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~still low key concerned for him~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): just wait for the instagram story where he challenges tyler to a drinking contest
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): then hes dead
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Fucking yikes, it's not even a joke because he 100% would
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I feel like thy put themselves into a toxic relationship, he's never gonna move on and be back to any sort of normalcy living life the way they do
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He should try being single
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He should
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think it would be good for him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~he said he broke up with me to get his life back together and because i was too bossy~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this doesnt look like "life back together"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i imagine this may very well be what he wants right now tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): besides the lack of love, he wants to be cool and party and casual and like the delaware squad
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think it's what he "wanted"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But I've feeling them Big regret vibes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): anna said she noticed him staring at me at katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): we have photographic evidence of that though
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/502528337953030145/548237102165524500/unknown.png
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He came to tall to me at katsu like 1 on 1 at the rwby shoot before everyone congregated
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think hes feelong like he doesnt have a place to fit in
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He got what he "wanted"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But now hes regretting his choices and doesnt feel 100% comfortable
N🆗ri (Marisa): do you think he thought over his choice at all? or was it spontaneous? did someone convince him to do it? weird.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think his only focus was on his crush for meg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And everything else just fell into place once he started pining after her
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And now hes in the middle of it all trying to make the best of it, because he did end up with meg.(which is ultimately what he wanted).. but I dont think meg is what he had hoped for. just based on their interactions that I have witnessed. It seems forced and uncomfortable.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're bein' held hostage
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think they make really great friends
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They get along well, but as soon as all the relationship shit started they've been super tense. Like ... ya know, maybe it's just not right for you???
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeeaah
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaaaa
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I feel that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Maybe try being single....??
Aldus Larian (Jess): They should just leave it at Friends or FWB
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yeaaaa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Definitely
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's almost like they are FWB but are trying to  "make it work" as a relationship and doing a really bad job at it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Exactly
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They just dont .. click
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But whatever man, do whatever
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he was talking to me when we played with out league team one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he said he "didnt understand relationships anymore"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kinda like he was fishing for advice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i was like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://giphy.com/gifs/tom-hiddleston-loki-relationship-CItbmP0pIy6sg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so yeah i think he got what past hal wanted
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but present hal isnt so sure thats what he wanted anymore
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I love that Loki giflmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal’s getting a bunch of relationship Tellonyms?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like how he classifies "two hour drive" as long distance
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like yeah, it's a fair distance but like, that's nothing compared to what's typically considered "long distance"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And has to say “the long distance isn’t why we broke up”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Heather sent out birthday invites
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal and JPaden were invited
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No meg tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Who's JPaden?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also she invited a ridiculous amount of people holy shit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeaaaah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s a photographer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s nice but very awkward
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He shot with me last year and once this year, he only likes to really do photos that recreate fanart and such
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Aaaah
Bill: Mm... Thats Easter weekend and that’s not a weekend I’m feeling hiking to deep PA. Also like my only interaction with Heather is when she calls me old so.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you're like, less than a year older than her aren't you?
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's Easter weekend?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof
Bill: Yeah. I dunno why she was doing it.
Bill: And yup Saturday of Easter.
Bill: Do I care that much for Easter stuff, no, but spending Easter weekend at Heather’s eeeeh.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah her birthday is the 21st so 20th is the closest she was able to get to that. Like, could have done the weekend before or after...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and it's at Round 1 which is basically just a big arcade
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s Round 1 in the USA??
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): buy a card, preload it with credits, and play
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.round1usa.com/location/exton-square-mall/
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone bring me
N🆗ri (Marisa): Those places are fun in japan
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do they still have anime figures
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably not
N🆗ri (Marisa): 0/10 USA sucks
Bill: oh whoops. I read that as it was at her house.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal getting more troll tellonyms wut
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wonder whos asking
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Some follower is probably heckling him because they’re miffed that hal and I broke up and because he insists on saying “I dumped georgia”, they blame him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause I doubt it would be someone we actually know
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also in lighter news, zeikani was the one who sent me the Tellonym about wanting to be better friends but being awkward as fuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): awwww thts nice
Bill: Or someone wants to find out if he and Meg are on the outs cause they have a crush.
Bill: Zeikani is nice. A tad crazy. But definitely fun to see.
Bill: I told her I'd be going to CPAC and while I'm ore on the fence with it, it'd be cool to hang with her and her random squad of people who all know her and no one else.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL crush on hal
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And yeee she nice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She said she’s been a lot more into becoming friends with cool people ever since she left her last relationship
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That person discouraged her from making cosplay friends
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal opened up an ask wanting to know what love is to people
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If I responded that would be the greatest troll but I think I’m just gonna watch
Bill: Didn't you mute his stories...?
Bill: I dunno if it's the same person, but Zeikani told me about how... fucks her name... popular overwatch cosplayer used her for photos alot and she got out of the relationship. Like, chick demanded better photos from a free shoot, didn't ask before making prints with photos (Zeikani wouldn't have had issue) and got pissy when Zeikani didn't do more photos of her in a group shoot.
Bill: Saw caps, pretty toxic stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): saw popular overwatch cosplayer and thought it was shannon
i don't think it's shannon she's been super nice whenever i work with her and never demanded photos
Bill: ~~👀~~
Bill: That's her.
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH NO REALLY?
Bill: https://www.instagram.com/s_noelle_cosplay/
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH OH NO
Bill: ye.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know her ;A; oh nooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe fame has changed her for the worse? we were better friends like 5 years ago when she worked at jo-anns and she was always sweet ;A; but i was never close to her
shannon noooooooo
Bill: Different people, different sides of them.
Bill: Wouldn't let it bother you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she's like one of the five convention friends i have i don't know many people ;A;
Bill: Zeikani had her own experience with her, you can have yours.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah the world is black and white that's why i cosplay edea
Bill: and
Bill: and
Bill: HOOKY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Zeikani said this is someone she dated for 3 years damn
N🆗ri (Marisa): h o o k y
but the characters in hooky don't often see things in black and white, like ||dorian and monica knew something was strange with dani but didn't know what||
Bill: ~~they dress in Black and White.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg wait i might have the stuff to cosplay a dani
N🆗ri (Marisa): the cute dress
N🆗ri (Marisa): THIS
N🆗ri (Marisa): my blue is a liiiitle darker but it's just three bows i can make that dress anytime owo
Bill: YE that the cute dress.
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone get a dorian
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it weird cosplaying more children though <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: S'long as you don't lewd it? probably fine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe not if 13 year olds keep sitting next to me at cons trying to befriend me
N🆗ri (Marisa): whoever lewd dani will die
Bill: || I cannot deny that ||
Bill: The smols can sense the homestuck and you and all 13 year olds must be stucks.
Bill: But also that was the first dress that came to mine when you said cute dress, so...
N🆗ri (Marisa): dani's cutest dress uwu
N🆗ri (Marisa): kiwi and justin both need to chill
Bill: ~~Erik is just actually Mark, shit~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): he publicly said he e-mailed her when she publicly told him to stop undermining him in the chat so why are they still hashing it out publicly instead of through e-mail
Bill: The jumin look a like.
N🆗ri (Marisa): jumin the boy next door
Aldus Larian (Jess): trouble at zenkon
N🆗ri (Marisa): kiwi tends to often talk like those capital letters and it comes off very harshly imo
N🆗ri (Marisa): she doesn't mean it to be she's just trying to be strict and in-control of the team but it comes off as mean and demanding
N🆗ri (Marisa): meanwhile the con chair last night was like "uwu hey guys! good ta see ya! Is everyone ready to start? uwu i'll give you a few minutes just in case!"
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't find the chapters with the dress <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): GOT IT
N🆗ri (Marisa): just had to complain about not being able to find it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Mood.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /sits down to study and focus, finally
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): >phone dings
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /ethan: hey call me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _of course_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): **oh no**
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO NO NO
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes like the only person i know who does that sept like my parents
N🆗ri (Marisa): reply back "sorry can't i lost my phone"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): told him im studying now so ill call him later

Bill: https://media.giphy.com/media/DOdsiolqbxCbm/giphy.gif
Aldus Larian (Jess): tell him your mic is broken
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): new phone, who dis
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oof i get so disappointed when my insta feed has too many solo shots
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk why but it bothers me
Bill: You're a social person and you like people.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OOP
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh dear
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _oop_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "*friend*"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but also
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OOP
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): probably one of the same anons that asked hal something
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): answering that ask is just asking for drama
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): delete
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but also.... just saying yes is entirely the nature of the situation 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that explains why hals getting heckled at least
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would just ignore
Bill: ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I kind of gave up on Tellonym because the very few messages I got were very boring to answer questions
Bill: what are questions lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): or particularly invasive
Bill: They're only invasive for women really.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly the invasive ones can be interesting so I don't really mind answering them to an extent
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): UHMMMM idk eriks were pretty invasive and hes a boi
Aldus Larian (Jess): im not really a supporter fo any anon  questions asking thing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but like "what's it like having a deep voice?" and "do you have any new years resolutions?" (which was sent 4 days ago, not even near New Year's) are so lame
N🆗ri (Marisa): resolution for next year
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What the fuck  tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): my thoughts exactly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like the other ones I got about dating were like, genuine preliminary questions to confessing she had a crush on me
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg that's so messed up that's harassment
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ngl i think erik gets more harassment than i do some days
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't like those "tell me about yourself!" games that ask for your eye color, height, middle name and whatnot. that's just fishing for personal data that can be used against you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): eh i dont mind stupid stuff like favorite food or whateber
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): obviously im very careful of people not finding out where i go to college tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): those are often security questions for password resets
Bill: I might find it more annoying if I was actually subject to it. but. Sometimes it's just nice to think people have an interest in you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o rly? my questions are like "whats your mothers childhood dogs name"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i only get generic questions, which is boring. OR i get people trying to start drama
N🆗ri (Marisa): doxxed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "what was your grandfather's nickname?" is one I have
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): d o x x e d
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this is the first time ive gotten someone starting drama i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): no questions my identity is safe <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i havent gotten really any inappropriate things
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia do you ever answer your tumblr asks
N🆗ri (Marisa): asking for a friend
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i get innocent questions and compliments for the most part
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): UHHHH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): not really i am a bad noodle
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oof calling ethan
Aldus Larian (Jess): live blog
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds like a good euphemism for something you dont wanna do
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll scream if he asks you why I haven't replied to his DnD text
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hes complaining about vic mignogna getting fired as RT
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow that's really important good thing you called him asap
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh **no**
Aldus Larian (Jess): lord help us
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hes talking about meg
Bill: .... Imagine it's him doing all this probing of Hal cause Ethan still think Meg hot and she shoulda fucked him cause of he's.... well, a dick.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "i was right about hal the whole time, but damn, sucks to be right"
Bill: ,...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/jennifer-lawrence-gif-3602072
N🆗ri (Marisa): what is even the purpose of this call
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its ethans weekly bitchfest
Bill: Sounds like he wants to prove he's right and better than Georgia.
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Bill: Which is *quickly* angering me so I'mma going leave before I start another round of yelling about how Ethan is a waste of time.
Bill: Dizzy agrees.
Aldus Larian (Jess): the funniest thing about that gif is i can literally see Leanna doing that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "we all gotta date the loser at some point, let hal spiral"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "youre a better person now"
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol wut
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're inspirational quotes for his book
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "i think im a happier, better person now that im in texas"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): we all think we're better happier people now that you're in Texas too
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG ERIK XD
Bill: ~~He's trying to assert dominance that he knew everything and Georgia was wrong the whole time so he can feel alpha and better than Georgia.~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): obviously
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok now the point of the call
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): confirming plans for his and caseys return
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the welcome back for 5 minutes party
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "return"
Aldus Larian (Jess): no plan
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): caseys having problems making friends in texas <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no ok thats sad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): shes back with a therapist tho
Bill: Good. It might drive her home when she realizes her controlling fiancee isn't even human, let alone enough human interaction for a person.
Bill: *Cause I wonder why people wouldn't like Casey*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "caseys family stressed her out a lot, i think moving down to texas helped her with that, i cursed her dad out the other day"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/blinking-eyes-gif-7953610
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the call is over 🙌
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _why are all the weirdos coming to play_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Bill: *because you don't tell them to fuck off* Okay promise that's the only time I just had to.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hello beautiful lady gives me nothing to work with
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i havent had this problem before damn

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the ethan party looks like the above image
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): immediately after he leaves
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we pull down a curtain to reveal the REAL party
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what month is this?
Bill: April I'd assume.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't invite him
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just invite casey
Bill: Ethan wrote his own guest list so.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did he put himself on it?
Bill: 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): technically no but casey neither
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hmm we can work with that
Bill: Tell him Jessica Nigeri or someone equally hot will die if he doesn't give her his dick in 24 hours. That'll keep him busy. Maybe get him arrested too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Screams
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I haven’t gotten dumb tellonyms til now, did I jinx it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh he ranted to me about Jessica Nigri once
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): something about using her body to make money
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yet claims she's a really nice person
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and brags that he got to chat extensively with her and her boyfriend at RTX while other people were trying to say hi and take pictures with her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he has a dude boner for fakenerdboy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea he does
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): a VERY large dude boner
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so whats everyone wanna do at 11:01 on the 27th? 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): take shots
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~at who~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hahaaaa jk gossip is bad kids, stay in school, eat your drugs, dont do vegetables
Bill: That's CPAC.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeet them on their way and then yeet ourselves to a con
Bill: people were on the fence with CPAC, but food for thought.
Bill: I at least would have to meet you if there was to be something done, cause I won't be at the dinner.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s my nephew’s birthday
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oooo Elizabeth Maxwell will be there
Bill: Oh?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~another signature for the BNE flag?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.castlepointanime.com/announcements/elizabethmaxwell.html
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and $20 for a day badge... not bad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But it was BAD last year
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dealers was ok but the set up is like Geekdom
Bill: It was fine.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bill I couldn’t hear you half the time lmao
Bill: The outdoor areas were decent unlike geekdom, and there were infinitely less creeps.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Con itself was bad time McGee tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooh split between the expo center and Holiday Inn... interesting
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): was it like that last year?
Bill: You never do anything at cons but shoot and shop.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea no one creeped on me there
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh wait i was dressed as a dude...
Bill: lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There weren’t THAT many places to shoot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk it felt much more lame than the old CPAC
Bill: There were more than *Geekdom*.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I may be biased by comparing the two
Bill: And the old CPAC WAS better, that's not the point here.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): old cpac was so good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :c
N🆗ri (Marisa): Mostly when it was sunny. It sucked when it rained and you wanted to move buildings.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh true
Aldus Larian (Jess): i never went to old cpac so i cant compare
Bill: Old CPAC was better Kotori.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Like kotoricon but the buildings spaced more apart and more greenery and a good food place
N🆗ri (Marisa): Have we all been at the same con and didn’t know it
Should I go through past pictures to find you guys
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it was really pretty
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and they had like stone walls and stuff too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it was so nice, i loved that con xD
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sometimes really bad line issues though
Bill: YEEE that happened.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): never had to deal with that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thankfully
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oo I found a picture I’m in!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which weeb are you
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the homestuck?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof that looks so cramped
N🆗ri (Marisa): I am a homestuck but not the one near the camera I’m way in the back. I think.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe not me maybe this was a different year. But I recognize the other cosplayers and I was in a chess game. Hmm.
Bill: ,... I was in a real funk (different reasons) both CPACs I've been to and I STILL swear it better than Geekdom.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think the last year to cpac I went I did idol beyond the boundary
N🆗ri (Marisa): And it was raining so it sucked but the years it was sunny it was great
N🆗ri (Marisa): Inochicon was the worst lol it was a literal scam so Sunday there was literally nothing. No dealers. No panels or events.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): All the attendees just had a party going up and down the escalators for like 3 hours
N🆗ri (Marisa): gasp there's casey
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she really only ever contributes to out-of-context quotes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which most quotes in that channel are not really... good...
N🆗ri (Marisa): hhhhyeahh
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm sure in the conversation they're hilarious, but the quotes should be funny/interesting with no context outside the conversation
N🆗ri (Marisa): like
https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext/
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~nvm most of those aren't good either~~ sort by best of year
Bill: if you add it yourself to the channel, it's probably not funny.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's like laughing at your own joke
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or when you post a mean quote someone said to you... like that's not really what this is for...
N🆗ri (Marisa): have people done that? :0 I assumed it was stuff that sounded mean but was just lacking context
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ugh all the kids with early decision are hearing back from summer internship applications already
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): noah got denied from cern, but accepted to a national lab and as a professor's trainee at perdue
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): all my applications are "still under review"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and NASA isnt even DUE til april 1st
Bill: Better than rejections, brightsides.
Bill: It hard though.
