Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Kind of rude considering she put it on the wrong eye last time I saw her in Kiri makeup...
N🆗ri (Marisa): does she mean the hardly perceptible little mark above his eye <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Bill: Oh boy straight up Meg tea. It’s Georgia’s lucky day.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I didn't want to say anything because, you know, telling a cosplayer they did something wrong is rude
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah
Bill: Damn Switzerland.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Everytime a cosplayer doesn't literally mangle themselves to portray an accurate character, I die a little inside
Bill: Yeah *Leanna*.
Bill: ~~I didn’t know Kiri had a scar~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: Like Weiss’s is at least noticeable damn.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's from when he discovered his quirk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He woke up to pee and was rubbing his eye when it activated
N🆗ri (Marisa): saddest part of the series after mirio tbh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Dude I just came back to see this
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm cracking up
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I immediately saw her tweet and went
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): " what scar?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Babu
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): I love that meme
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HI IM LATE TO MEG TEA BUT HELLO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Don't get too excited now <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It ok I have Geek Week responsibilities that will keep me from gossiping anyways
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /sees Hal’s comment in BNE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like how Anna posted her message in cosplans, deleted it, and then reposted it in general...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I thought that's what happened
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): --obviously still sober enough to care what thread you post in~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~?~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Apparently 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I wouldnt have noticed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *silence*
Bill: Probably just wants to chat and the people around are doing something else.
Bill: Means she’s thinking about us.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Aw
Bill: I think she’s prone to loneliness and she’s found a lot of solice in the group.
Bill: Which confuses me cause she a very social and personable woman, I can’t imagine she lacks friends.
Bill: But if she needs good friends... BNE is happy to provide.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I dunno, I feel like with a few exceptions most of BNE likes to keep to people they know 🙀
N🆗ri (Marisa): It could be my imagination
Bill: There’s the 3 subgroups, yes, but in general she can reach out and socialize. I’d imagine just shooting the shit with you for hours about cosplays is exactly what she wants.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Anna is so cool and strong I must meme like her
Bill: One of these days I’m going to make a political chart of BNE.
Bill: She likes you too.
Bill: Sometimes you just need meme friends.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do it I wanna see the three subgroups :0
I never meme
N🆗ri (Marisa): straight laced like the stripes of a decorative faux Siberian tiger fur
Bill: Plus she can keep up with your crazy and that makes for a unique person.
N🆗ri (Marisa): with who crazy <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): do you think self loathing can mess with the brain and cause death <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why do you ask? 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): optimism? 👀
Bill: 
Bill: Kinda.
Bill: Ryan could probably could as old squad.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's the yellow circle?
N🆗ri (Marisa): where do i go :3c
Bill: ... how did I miss you.
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): i traverse this plane and the next continuously going in and out of existence
Bill: Yellow is perceived leader.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Monica is a squiddy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, a lowkey squid
Bill: Fully? She always seems a bit distant from them.
Bill: Yeaaaah like that.
Bill: I feel the same way about Annette.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Annette is more like an honorary squid
Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👌🏻
N🆗ri (Marisa): bne is so big
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Snow should be in squid
Bill: True. I just went down the userlist and she yeeted again.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): True
N🆗ri (Marisa): l o w k e y s q u i d
Bill: Added... I feel like Hunter isn't exactly unaligned...
Bill: but not an actual unit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I didn't even notice she wasn't in there
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like the box in the box
i imagine they wear those squid hats
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like there should be an arrow between Hunter and Anna, no?
Bill: Yeah, that could work...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hunter is like in the middle of squid and us
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And Chris and Gen lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why is this a thing?
Bill: He's trying to like... have his own squad. Outside of his famous people squad.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like it because i have no idea who anybody is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hunter is the spot in the middle of the Squid/Aurii/DE triangle
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Dead center
Bill: But. That doesn't quite work.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): With a portal that goes to Mangoloo's squad
Bill: @ Jess: It's a socialolgy thing?
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i'm a sociology thing i have that book on disasters
Aldus Larian (Jess): mmm likely story
Bill: Whatever ulterior motives you think I have I do not.
Bill: I find the social hierarchy in BNE amusing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it definitely exists
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wait, why does the line from Squid say dislike for Georgia? Is there tea there I'm unaware of?
Bill: Squid squad sides with Georgia in the break up right?
Bill: That's all.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah. I just don't get why the line connecting them to Delaware says that
Bill: cause that's their interaction with Delaware.
Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: LOL
Bill: Nah.
Bill: While this is a fun experiment, it's by no means what should be. At the very least we should try to be open to Squids.
Bill: Consider this... a road map for how to be more... inclusive?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Agreed. Like, it's not that I don't like them, it's that I like you guys more
Bill: ~~I of course am the founder of one of the cliques and openly encourage said cliques existence because I have trust issues with large groups but~~
Bill: Call it a map of inner circles.
Bill: Ah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): あ？
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I LIKE THIS MAP
Bill: Stupid fucking graph algorithm isn't helping me prove a point.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s so funny
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But also accurate
Bill: AUGH FUCK IT
Bill: I wanted to put everyone in a single subgraph called BNE to represent friendship and all that crap, but fucking program won't do it without drawing lines over everyone's names.
Bill: So just.
Bill: pretend that symbolic gesture was made.
Bill: *also* I'm not sure if Meg should be called leader of the Delaware crew but Hal's just. Not together enough to lead anything.
N🆗ri (Marisa): cross out our names survivor style <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Had to COMPLETE REDO THE STYLE. But look. Unitied.
N🆗ri (Marisa): **the web**
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Fake_Erik*
N🆗ri (Marisa): good work this should be in a math textbook

Bill: That's what it actually looks like.
N🆗ri (Marisa): hacker voice version
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): LOL ETHAN
Bill: ~~I need someone not in BNE~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I didn't even notice Ethan 😂
Bill: to give you an idea of what happens that's been frustrating me.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would have just done everything on a blank PowerPoint slide using shapes lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sharing again cuz I must
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sadly accurate
Bill: Oh I didn't see it the first time.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It was like weeks ago
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just pin thay
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: ah fuck I thought it was perfect, one line goes right through Snow.
Bill: *Oh well*.
Bill: I need to stop tweaking this it's a pointless graph I'm never sharing but *it needstobeperfect*
Bill: Fuuuuuuck empathy I’m not good with words and empathy I’m more of a “here’s a warm hug feel better” and discord hasn’t done that feature yet.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah I wasn't sure how to respond and "I'm sorry for your loss" is too generic and impersonal :/
Bill: Always afraid no response comes off as not caring, since you can’t see the other person react or hug etc. Even if it’s generic at least it’s acknowledgement of listening.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): True
N🆗ri (Marisa): i went up to get something from my room and the insulation we put on the ceiling fell off from the wind and now it's leaking again <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh shit!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ughhh that's terrible
N🆗ri (Marisa): i told bojo it leaked before we put up the insulation because i had giant buckets up there but she convinced me it was fixed. guess not because it all leaked behind the foam <:lenny:395307171539189760>
