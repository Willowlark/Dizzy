Aldus Larian (Jess): rebeccas gon steal ma yona spot
Bill: ~~no she ain't~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ... did anyone realize snow left BNE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i just did
Leanna: She does this every time she has a melt down
Bill: I think it was recent but also I'm hard pressed to care. Cause ^
Leanna: I noticed immediately when hunter asked for her parents number
Bill: I thought of it a couple days before that, dunno why.
Bill: Thought nothing of it.
Leanna: This is like a regular occurrence
Leanna: And then she vague posts about it in her Instagram story or on Facebook, I've really urged myself to stop caring even if that's hard for me to do
Erik: Like it's hard not to care because people not caring could drive her to do something dangerous
Bill: But it's also not your responsibility to be her anchor.
Erik: Also true
Leanna: I know other people care about her so I've kinda just divorced myself from it all
Bill: Hunter and her got along... *swimmingly*... at CCE.
Leanna: Yea.......
Aldus Larian (Jess): LOL
Bill: that is a ~~Kokoro~~ pregnant pause.
Aldus Larian (Jess): sorry i like puns
Bill: *oh so that's why we've been friends so long*
Aldus Larian (Jess): is there tea here?
Bill: The channel has *tea* in the name.
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz i know after cce he was saying stuff like "crushes suck"
Bill: MM, I remember that.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HUNTER NO
Leanna: Yea he like really likes her, and shes a lesbian so. That's rough buddy
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaa ok kinda figured
Bill: ooooof rip.
Bill: Feelings suck.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): poor hunter
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): shes got so much drama on top of it
Leanna: Yeaaaaa he took a huge step back and I was proud of him... but then he dove right back in and made up with her and now it's like 10x worse
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO! 😭
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~casey come back and date hunter~~
Leanna: Oh mood lmao
Bill: PLEASE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it would be a funny joke if she didnt actually seem the happiest when hanging with hunter
Aldus Larian (Jess): she seemed to have alot of fun with him
Aldus Larian (Jess): does he like casey? like like like?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think he did at least at one point
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): they were like two peas in a pod
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i sound like a middle schooler~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): always in sync
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~they would be kyoot together~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _everyone thinks that ahhhh_
Bill: they were best friends yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHH rebecca wants to do raven too, rip me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): jess is best gurl tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): r a i n b o w r a v en
Bill: Case in point.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WUT
Aldus Larian (Jess): LIES
Bill: Mom works past 8pm every night now. If not at her desk, on the phone with the Doctor or Minyie(?) at, cooking dinner, etc.
Bill: Getting on my damn nerves.
Bill: She had no boundaries to stop working, so she keeps working forever, and that cuts into time I spend with her. If she can’t be off work for a fucking hour to sit with her family like?
Bill: That’s an issue.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Did you communicate with her
Bill: As it so happens, communication like we’ve been preaching is pointless with your parents, because you’ll always be their kid.
Bill: So she’ll continue to ignore my opinion till she decides she wants to work less and that’ll be that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Depends on what kind of relationship you have
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I heavily disagree
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Might just be your parents
Bill: Perhaps I was hasty in saying so.
Bill: We’re just a stubborn lot and... sometimes that makes for difficulties.
Erik: I just came across a cosplayer who might be just as bad as, if not worse than Ethan...
N🆗ri (Marisa): share
Bill: Avoid.
Erik: Just unfollowed... and his gf who's just as bad...
Erik: 
Erik: 
Erik: 
Erik: *"constructive criticism"*
Aldus Larian (Jess): RUDE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why does that name look familiar huh
Erik: They were the Mercury and pregnant Yang at the RWBY shoot at last year's Katsu
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dont even remember that
Erik: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): her cosplay is on point what is this dude talkin about
Erik: I don't really know why I followed them to begin with. They're.... ...an interesting couple....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH I REMMEBER THAT
Erik: He's bitching about the hair color being off... like dude, it's called *lighting*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ah yeah he follows me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh Idk people that complain about girls starting patreons are just dumb gatekeepers
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Someones just jealous..
N🆗ri (Marisa): IT'S NOT EVEN OFF
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait
N🆗ri (Marisa): gotta flaten layers
N🆗ri (Marisa): NOT OFF
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Shoutout to the guy that commented where he can get that lingerie for his girlfriend lmao
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): <@245270932602486784> I KNOW
Erik: 
Erik: This was the source material *they* were referencing
Leanna: Hi, in what world is that wig "lime"
Erik: RIGHT?
N🆗ri (Marisa): she looked like that in 2003, he confirmed with her she was doing a whole different version
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Jealousy
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's in the wrong for using the wrong version *after confirming which version she was doing*
Erik: I just... don't get... why people comment that shit... for no good reason...
N🆗ri (Marisa): and of course his cosplay is inaccurate
Erik: Yeah his Mercury isn't accurate because he has real legs
Erik: If you want to be accurate you gotta cut them off
Erik: And make screen accurate metal prosthetics
Leanna: The fact that they both went as far as to make posts on their personal account attacking her for her " inaccurate cosplay"
Erik: That actually shoot bullets
Leanna: Like.......
Leanna: Uhhhh
Leanna: Are yall serious?
N🆗ri (Marisa): his dio is missing bracelet/armband things, the belt is wrong, and he's missing the earrings
N🆗ri (Marisa): not to mention the wig
Erik: Yeeeeaaahhh I had been thinking about unfollowing them for a while and this did it for me
Erik: Meanwhile, I just followed luxlo and am about to spam her with likes because damn she good
Leanna: Oh same
Erik: V cute Lola Bunny
Bill: Only skimmed the text but I can imagine what the rest is. People suck. And no one should complain about cute Lyn. Lyn is best girl and needs more love.
Bill: ,... I followed luxlo and immediately got two message requests from porn bots.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wtf so did Leanna and I... after... following Luxlo...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hmm...
Bill: Could just be scanning her new followers.
Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): People need to stop going hard in their 21st
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is that why?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ughh
Bill: I need to not snark Hunter for the passive aggressive public chat shoot request. Give me strength. ~~shit I did need Jesus~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think our backyard got broken into, the fence door is missing and there's trash everywhere ;-;
which is freaky because my bed is right against the door that leads to the backyard so I should have heard something
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): maybe an animal?
N🆗ri (Marisa): no like the door was ripped off its hinges and there are soda bottles and stuff everywhere
we don't keep trash in our backyard but we do live in a very high crime area
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh god
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): did they just like... have a party in your backyard
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's creepy because the backyard is like 10 feet big and immediately next to me so I should have heard anything that happened
N🆗ri (Marisa): probably illegal dumping
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): do you have airpods
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're headphones right? :0
no i can usually hear everything that happens with headphones on, I can hear my cat jump on the kitchen counter from 2 stories up it's like a spidey sense owo
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's trash next door too and their gate is open but not busted
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh wow what the hell
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That happened to Jess's parents
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But it was a 🐻
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg i wish
new friend
Bill: This amuses me. My paycheck goes into my chase account. They know what my income is.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh capitol one asked me for that today too
Aldus Larian (Jess): and im like "bold of you to assume it has changed"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ethan texted me just to tell me he’s buying a Mercedes S class
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t even know what that is
Bill: Probably a car that screams he has a small dick.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg that's one of the cars the driver draws in kuragehime when they tell him he sucks at drawing everything except cars
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's like. fancy car for rich people.
N🆗ri (Marisa): recent models cost $90,000 and up that's more than our house cost
and yet he can't throw himself a party <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Looks.... Totally worth that much
N🆗ri (Marisa): nyoom
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's just a fancy luxury cat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hope he has fun paying that off for the rest of his life
Bill: Careful, he’ll start bragging about his salary.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm betting he crashes it at some point
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Someone was *only* doing 90 on the highway while I was doing 120 and I couldn't slow down in time"
Aldus Larian (Jess): UGH
N🆗ri (Marisa): one sentence horror story
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh people that blow money on crazy expensive cars don’t make sense to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There’s a point where the more you pay, you’re not actually getting a better car
N🆗ri (Marisa): the exception:
