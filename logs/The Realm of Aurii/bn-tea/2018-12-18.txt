Bill: Me calling Hal in my head a know it all is ironic as hell.
Bill: @ BNE

*TECHNICALLY you did randomly become friends with Brandon and Tyler, and I meaaaan*
Bill: I don't think it's a poor joke, but Meg is a time bomb so...
Bill: RIIIIIIIIP
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): A knuckles cosplay would be cool and probably popular but do I tell Erik to be careful with jokes because Ugandan Knuckles is considered racist by many or leave it be
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🤔 good point
Bill: Ugandan Knuckles is amazing.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I don’t want him beaten up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ☝️
Bill: Last Katsu there was a *parade* of ugandan knuckles chanting and looking for a queen.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That doesn't mean people can't/won't find it offensive and kick his ass tho.bits unlikely, but possible
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Really?? I bet they all got beat up
Yeah what jess said. Whodigiya and his friend group absolutely loathe it and they’ve posted huge stories against using it. It can be used in non racist ways, but some people may be sensitive to it.
Bill: Well, I'm a terrible person cause I think it hilarious.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Just don’t use it racistly <:lenny:395307171539189760>
