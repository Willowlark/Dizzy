Bill: I’m paranoid, but seeing that Jing and Vincent are dming in Chinese behind me in the office just makes me feel like they’re talking about me.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah but like
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Is that realistic
Bill: I dunno. I'n not very close with them.
Bill: Their coworkers though. I don't stress it, cause I know I'm paranoid.
Bill: Happens at IBM sometimes too, either of them with the chinese members of the IBM team going at it in chinese with random words thrown in that are english only like 'Random Forest Algorithm'.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We can start sending you messages in pig Latin if you want. Or gibberish. Make things even.
Bill: lol.
Bill: I know pig latin. Couldn't do it quickly tho.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Screenshot it and I’ll have Sam translate lol
Bill: I saw it over their shoulders. It's their DMs lol.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I am very frustrated by how Kiwi is running things. I get she’s trying to instill the fear of safety staff god into us but she’s coming across as patronizing. 
And apparently no one in safety staff knows how to read.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know Kiwi is a good person but her online speech style is really frustrating, on top of the frustration that comes from people not reading important emails and not knowing how to use the internet
N🆗ri (Marisa): BoJo and I are considering quitting zenkai staff next year because of how bad things have been run so far.
Bill: oof.
Bill: You can room with us then!
Bill: I kinda... interviewed someone to be my... manager?
Bill: Was weird.
Bill: The whole team did, Jing Vincent and I.
Bill: But I don't think she's what any of us were really looking for in a senior team member.
N🆗ri (Marisa): “If you were to work here, what bonuses would you grant your employees!”
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did it go like that
Bill: We want a nerd, who likes algorithms and stuff. Not someone so business focused.
Bill: She'd not be technically my boss... Just organizer of the day to day stuff. Project management, not people management.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That just means that your job actually gives a shit weather you guys get along
