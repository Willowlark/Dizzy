Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): temple cancelled my free photoshop artshjhg that sucks
i can renew it for the semester but after may i guess i'll go back to using CS2
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): UGH
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): What's the latest before the subscription?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 6?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): temple has creative cloud 2018
the latest i have before that is cs2 because it's so outdated they have it for free on the adobe website lol
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): We bought that on school discount just before the CC came out
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i hate creative cloud, the cloud never loads when i need to log in and i don't like storing stuff on clouds
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): yolo i'm gonna try gimp again
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): it's on my computer might as well give it a try
Bill: Classic gimp.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah... So sad
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Adobe is such a bad company
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Unfortunately nothing is as user friendly as Photoshop for that
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Gimp can do anything Photoshop can but it's just harder
Bill: I used to find gimp more user friendly.
Bill: I now find neither user friendly and hide in lightroom.
Bill: There‚Äôs a couple of cheaper lightroom alternatives I‚Äôve seen in blogs Mawisa. Could look at those, though they don‚Äôt usually spot edit.
Bill: Also Mag looks much emptier than Katsu and that sounds wonderful.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i can't adjust shadows and highlights artsydtufy back to trusty old cs2 it is
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): magfest has a lot less cosplay since it's more game-oriented and less attendees. only a thousand something people.
Bill: Sounds great let‚Äôs do that.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): do your photoshoot models ever not listen to you
idk what it is about my models but they never listen when i recommend something and the photo turns out weird
Bill: Or they misinterpret the directions. Some people I find do bette exposing when I let them do their own thing and give minimal direction. I think it‚Äôs a like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being correct so I feel like I‚Äôm doing it wrong‚Äù thing, so then they lose confidence in their posing.
Bill: Since I shoot with the same people mostly, I start to get a feel for the way they shoot.
Bill: ~~this is counter productive to shooting new people to meet new ~~singles~~ people, but whatever at this point~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): "can you bend your arm and fingers a little"
"this is the way he does it in the anime"
"it'll look more natural if you bend your arm a bit"
"he doesn't do that in the anime"
ok
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): 
Bill: Oh that‚Äôs just weird.
Bill: Never had anyone do that.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): maybe it's an exhibits staff thing
lanie and her friend did that too during their kill la kill shoot. they'd just to whatever and tell me to take pictures of it, like pose right in front of the sun because "that's where the best light is" and wouldn't let me retake it facing the other direction
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): we did get christmas photos for the next 3 years
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): if u see any flaws pls point them out thank
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmaoi read that as
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): If you see any flaws please don't point then.out
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I can't handle it
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): **point! them! out!**
lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): /squints at BNE chat
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): their proposed photoshoot sounds scary
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i would just like to think that they have more depth as people than to make everything sexual
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oo wut channel
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I have like 4 muted
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): which ones do you have muted?
i think this is in photography
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Fluffy Bois 
Fanart
Spoilers
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Okay 3
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i have fluffy and fanart muted as well lol
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I was hovering over vent for a while
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I had games muted too
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): im confused about how crocs became a big deal. was one of the bnha characters wearing crocs in official fanart or do they just really love crocs? because they aren't popular at all in japan so i can't see them being used as product placement but maybe they were? or do they just have a strong love for crocs
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think thats just an erik thing
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): oooo
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): shoulda got him crocs for secret santa smh
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It cuz Kiri is a croc
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): hard skin?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): SPIKE TEETH
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): oooooooooooooooooooooooOOOO
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's all that matters I guess
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao idk
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It's a stretch
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): pointy tooth
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _ok but it definitely became an erik thing then_
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i've spoken with judges and the head of cosplay at zenkai about what's cosplay of a character and when that crosses over into OC territory. they have awesome costumes but i feel it's straying away from actual bnha cosplay and turning into oc cosplay
like have i mentioned my friend who cosplays ouran
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ooo there was a big fight about this on tumblr a few years back
a girl did a casual humanstuck, genderbent tavros and it didn't look like cosplay it was just a picture of her under a tree and it sparked this huge debate

my ouran friend is kind and great but she cosplays genderbent mafia tamaki (and has some other genderbent mafia ourans, like a hunny cosplayer and a kyoya). if you look at them the only thing that identifies them as ouran cosplayers is hunny's bunny rabbit. that's it. nothing else looks ouran-like, so that prompted the original "oc vs au" discussion
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): honestly a lot of yaoi fangirls get fanon its just the reality
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and some people cant seperate the two
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~like pervert pyrrha is big in artist circles~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): hmm. yeah. OH NO NOT YEAH THAT SOUNDS AWFUL
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): (I mean even bumblebee started fanon Imo)
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ~~like the line our yumemi got at TGS because that character is popular as a dominatrix~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): fandom is difficult
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): People just keep on expanding on personality and fanfiction during off seasons
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Then when the next season comes around and it doesn't fit thier new fannon they get mad
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): extremely valid. that's why i don't read fanfiction, the characterizations get very off
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): **I honestly hope bnha makes like Kiri mina Canon and watch them melt down**
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oop
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): a lot of characters get boiled down to one or two traits, like if they offhandedly comment "this is a good cookie" in a random episode then that's it. they're cookie boy. addicted to cookies forever in fanon.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): that would be funny
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh yeah forsure
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And while they are alright doing that cuz everyone is allowed to do thier own thing and stuff
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But ya know
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tom u instrument of chaos
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but also, i agree
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): it's good for them to enjoy the stuffs! creating content is beautiful and wonderful
but let us hope they don't plaster lewd kiribaku delusion cosplay shoots all over the server
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): man hals too go with the flow
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he obviously follows meg around like a little puppy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he lowkey did the same when we were dating
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): u right, she didn't even ask she just said "he's gonna do it" :0
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Which is why he changes his opinions all the time ye
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): we're out of tea. we need more.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): CANT BE OUT OF TEA
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): There is an infinite supply in the world
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Apparently Trump still has the government shut down waiting for the wall or something but that's too serious tea
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): oof government tea
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I heard they had a meeting today and he said specifically "I'll keep the government shut down for years if I have to"

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): hehehehe
the stages of a meme gone too far
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): someone messaged me for advice and gave me their instagram and i followed the wrong insta because there were 2 people with super similar usernames
and i messaged her "nice mystic messenger cosplay" in the original message
and then i realized my horrible mistake when she followed me from her account and not the account I followed. she probably thinks i'm a jerk for not following her first oops
BUT LUCKILY SHE ALSO DID MYSTIC MESS COSPLAYS SO I'M SAFE
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao I doubt it
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): actually i think they're both her accounts? i can't tell
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): wait. yeah.

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): NOT THAT I WOULD DO IT but food for thought
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I'd be okay with Jess doing it too, but for protection reasons I wouldnt want it cuz it invites creeps

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~hal didnt want me to lmao~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ripppp

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): noah said logistically he knows im not interested in dating followers anyways
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that's good
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It's good when you have that trust too
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): the thought of you getting more creeps than you already do is terrifying
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like I never worry about Jess cheating or anything like that cuz we have great trust and I have no reason not to trust her
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): She's never given me a reason to
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): does jess get creeps?
