Aldus Larian (Jess): Ethans most recent story is him playing guitar but i never have my sound on and that is not what it looked like at first glance
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): At least it’s always obvious I’m playing guitar
N🆗ri (Marisa): now he's just playing *mind games*
Aldus Larian (Jess): probably

Bill: 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 😹
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UJZbixgKeQTwhsblvGN559N5ih2EE_3F
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): JPaden shoots such DARK photos
Bill: some quality high contrast in there too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): alot seem out of focus
Bill: weird framing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): have you shot with him before?
Bill: She has.
Bill: At least last Zenkai.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yea
Aldus Larian (Jess): i find the contrast almost jarring
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the shadows are too high
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its hard to see faces
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which is a shame cause everyone is gorgeous
Bill: iirc this was a midday shoot, so. sun. But also yeah, raccoon face in full effect.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea and then the highlights are like BAM
Bill: He's way more zoomed out than he needs to be.
Bill: ~~if you wonder why I always stick you in cold shady areas, this is why~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof yeah the Nora chose him
Bill: Nora chose everyone I thought.
Aldus Larian (Jess): what else has he shot for ouy?
Bill: fallout is the one I was around for
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): holy backlighting Batman
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yup Nora chose everyone too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He shot pyrrha last year that’s it
Aldus Larian (Jess): and that was ok?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We were inside at night so I guess so lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i was gonna say, it kinda looks like his camera setting may have been pre set to do an indoor shoot before this one?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): everything is like super blown out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I try to fix?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I like that I got the blurred background
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s always one of my fav touches
Bill: I downloaded one of the raws and basically hit auto in lightroom...
Aldus Larian (Jess): is he going to be ok with you editing them before posting though?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): DAMN MUCH BETTER
Bill: you cannot post that tho.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye he said to edit at our leisure
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah the long photos make it rough
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): that kinda makes me think he didnt edit them?
Bill: I'd believe it.
Bill: And I don't consider myself a heavy editer.
Bill: He may not have lightroom. RAW editing has less options for editing software...
Bill: JPG edits are less effective...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had to edit the STRQ photos from Rebecca...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They were really dark
Bill: She doesn't have the software, that's for sure.
Bill: DSLRs lean dark, cause dark pixels can be recovered easier than white pixels.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just edited via Instagram. But hoooo boy did it make a difference
Bill: Though, editing a bit to fix the lighting issues, Nora's knee? seems to be more in focus than anyone's face.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean after your editing they were pretty good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How expense is Lightroom?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^^^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i use lightroom on my phone and its free, or like 5 dollars for extra features
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She decided to shoot us in the shade so the sun wasn't in ~~my~~ our faces
Bill: that's a smart move.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im always afraid to edit anyones photos further
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i feel guilty doing it, but if i get permission then its alright
Bill: he shot that at 18mm, and I don't get why... 18mm isn't flattering and move your feet.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I usually do a few minor adjustments and then throw a vignette on it because I'm a slut for vignettes lol
Bill: These are the adobe pricing plans, I only use lightroom and lightroom classic, so I could use the photography plan for 10 a month. However, Katy needs the rest of the stuff so I split the 52 a month with her. We get student discount still, ~~and if we lose it I may leave her on her own fuck 600 a year~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): original vs edit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m a ho for bright colors and blurred backgrounds
Aldus Larian (Jess): me too gurl
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh same
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HMMMM I wonder if Rutgers has some free ripoff Lightroom
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye i got permission to edit the penny photos from katsu:
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bright looks better
Bill: it may give you access to lightroom. But you like working on your phone anyway. The features Leanna mentioned that are paid are mostly related to cloud sync. Get the mobile lightroom and use that Georgia.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea it loks much better im just always worried im going to upset the photographer. Pros  usually have strict rules against editing. then again they are pros for a reason
Bill: Rebecca's got the talent, I don't think she has the technical skills. Her old camera was SUPER over exposed and it looked bleh, and now she has to learn the way a dslr works. As I recall she has no real editing software outside I think like, google photos.
Bill: Part of me has considered offering to help her, buuttttt I don't want to come off like 'I'm better than you' so I've never gotten to it.
Bill: I'm the photographer in BNE ~~before Hunter anyway~~ but that's never meant 'the best/senior` photographer and I'm certainly not going to act like it did.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i know she uses photoshop for like MINOR editing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like very slight changes, nothing really
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah she fixed my glove hole
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like minor touchups
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i watched her do it after ice skating
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but nothing really with lighting or coloring
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that takes an eye though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so i understand
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its a learning curve
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and to do it for every picture is definitely tedious and she seems to like to get them back asap
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~ha curve~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~bad photoshop joke~~
Bill: ~~I still don't know how to use the curve~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): move point till look good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah she got me Pyrrha back by Sunday of con
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea it takes away all the bars and you just move the points around lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): she got me mononoke back day of
Bill: I like the sliders tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): me too
Bill: People have only asked a handful of time to edit my stuff... Twice to shop something into the picture (Tom didn't technically *ask* but 😛 ), once to edit body paint for spots where it rubbed off... I'm not a huge fan of editing in stuff via shop cause I like to keep things 'real', the touch ups was okay... But I assume the lack of requests means my post processing looks good. ~~Or I'm too intimidating/unfriendly/something to ask about doing it~~
Bill: lol turn around time.
Bill: Definitely my weak point
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think you have the benefit of knowing what cosplayers are insecure about
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So you can tailor the photos to avoid the need for photoshop
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like fixing a wig here or exposed bra there or whatever
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive edited your photos for flyaways and for my nips showing through my clothes but thats it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh and one time i shoped my wig
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): IDK WHY THAT SHOCKED ME SO MUcH
Aldus Larian (Jess): it was cold XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean valid but LMAO did not expect
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ve smoothed out pimples before for sure
Bill: I think you mentioned that to me, but I can't remember which shoot it was.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was also wearing THREE FUCKING LAYERS WTF
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _super nips_
Aldus Larian (Jess): the yukata nier
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nips so hard they could cut glass
Bill: Nope, if you did it wasn't for that one.
Bill: ~~reassurance I don't awkwardly start at photos of my friends...!~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh wait no
Aldus Larian (Jess): my nip was showing but i didnt know it untill later when i had already posted it
Aldus Larian (Jess): so i think I edited it after thinking id delete it and repost but then i said fuck it cuz "oooo no people are gonna know you have nipples"
Bill: wasn't it a Nora shoot?
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk cant remember
Bill: Doesn't really matter.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Surprise girls have nip nops
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): -gasp- NO
Bill: so yeah. Edits. I think I manage to do enough without overdoing, it keeps to what my 'style' would be, and do enough I don't return what Jpaded did.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: Rebecca will get it eventually I think. I need to see one of her new galleries with the dlsr.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think for her its a matter of just taking the extra time to do true color correction edits
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause her photos looks really good, just the colors are off
Bill: Lighting is most important. Colors adjust based on light too. Most of the time I click saturation up 10 and everything pops nice.
Bill: When the *white balance* is off that's another story, but I *pray* she doesn't have to deal with *those*.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i take the shittiest lighting photos at work and them look decent with curves
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same
Bill: To show...
Bill: Unedited
N🆗ri (Marisa): I edit my eye color on your photos but it’s been years since I asked to do that 👀
Bill: Just light adjustments
Bill: Saturation +10
Bill: Even the lighting adjustments changes the pink's tone.
Bill: ~~and the Marisa special~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Chocowaffo comments on everyone’s pictures holy heckie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel weird about her after Katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do you ever go back and redo edits because that’s why it’s taking me so long. I’ll edit one thing that I think looks good and then go back to look at it and go “nope”
Bill: rarely these days.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): chocowaffo is .....something
Bill: Bakarina is a recent example, but that's cause I want to work on the raw image, not the smart preview my tablet has.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have no animosity towards her but i just try to keep my distance xD shes too much for me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like chocowaffo, but she can be a little much. Like she's nice, but can be a little overbearing. My main thing is that what Ethan did to her was rude and uncalled for
Bill: I don't like chocowaffo. Also no animosity, but not someone I want to be around.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ditto
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She had drama with hunter too
Bill: Would never trust her, her 'I'm Nora' shit is fucking annoying.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^^^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~She thinks my husband is hot dont try to change my mind~~
Bill: All of the cringe of Casey's Ruby persona, but none of the understandable justification of being launched to fame without warning and trying to deal with it as a reserved person.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): accurate
Aldus Larian (Jess): the "booplings" pus me off
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SAME
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~she posts too much on the RWBY cosplay pages~~
Bill: Also she wants fame, and most people who do annoy me.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeaaah she pretty obviously wants to be famous
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she like wants to be known as  "the nora" of the rwby community, and when no one cares she gets really upset and posts about it on social media
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which annoys me
Aldus Larian (Jess): big fucking mood
Bill: ~~cause Jess is true Nora~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but like meeting her i dont think shes a bad person, just .... way too much try-hard fr me to like her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): understandable
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i feel like she thinks shes like queen of the noras and im like plz no
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TRYHARD THATS THE WORS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have nothing against her personally I was surprised she actually knew her me and tom were at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I said something in a group chat with her and she was like AHHH GEORGIA I LOVE YOU and I was like wot
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~she only recognized tom at first tho~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye she’s a nice person but just a tryhard
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wut really
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEET
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): agreed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): also that weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): she followed tom beofre me too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The falsies must’ve thrown her off
Bill: Didn't Scott think she faked the fall at the RWBY shoot?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~its cuz tom is a beautiful ren and she knows it~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Well cause Stephen said it was a skit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I sent her and Stephen keychains for Christmas and she was so excited she sent me her entire set of prints... for free... autographed...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But in the moment that we probably to avoid embarrassment
N🆗ri (Marisa): what was The Fall?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403>  oof
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she allegedly had a fainting spell
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and "passed out"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): in the middle of the rwby shoot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she has some kind of health issue. not sure what
Bill: What skit. That's not. in 3.0 canon.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and got up crying, but told everyone it was fine
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and then stephen told people it was a skit
N🆗ri (Marisa): o
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but then she posted on facebookt hat she has a health condition
N🆗ri (Marisa): yikes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >.>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Bill: If it wasn't an actual issue, that's some grade A attention whore shit.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like idk what to believe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Bill: No one.
Bill: Believe only what you can see for yourself.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, I don't want to assume she's faking, but like, if it turned out she was I wouldn't be surprised
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Stephen is chill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He signed up for a LOT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bless him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea hes really nice, and quiet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but also didn't they get engaged after knowing each other for only a few months?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like he’s cool helping her, he’s friendly, I chatted with him after the proposal
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think like 9 yeah
Bill: The Snow Mist thing I never picked a side. (asides from the 'keep Georgia out of it' side.) I didn't know Snow well, I'd never met Mist, and therefore I couldn't trust any of them.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think i was put off on her right away cuz i felt like she was trying to "own" nora
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea she is
Bill: *Jess V chocowaffo, hammer fight*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she like never stops doing her weird nora voice
Aldus Larian (Jess): NUUUU
Bill: ***yes***
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ve never seen her de-Nora’d
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont fight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~*she just sounds weirdly congested when doing her Nora voice*~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I see more Nora than Brittanie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _do you ever see more Pyrrha than Georgia or Yang than Leanna_
Bill: oh ye. When I first saw Casey I was turned off, despite liking rwbylands, cause I didn't know she had an 'off' mode.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nora > Weiss > Brittanie
Bill: Otakon'17.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i know a lot of people see me only as yang, and it gets almost weird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~good singing voice, but there's a time and place for over-the-top operatic singing~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I try to get "in character" somewhat but i never want people to see me as a character and not a person
N🆗ri (Marisa): should i be happy i've never met any of these people :0
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes
Bill: Asides Casey. She's nice enough, just has lots of friend walls.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~karaoke is not one of them~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): casey is cool once you get past her barriers
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She sings in the most random places yeah...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but initially she seems unapproachable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Casey played jackbox drunk with me and was super cool
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and kinda off putting
Aldus Larian (Jess): big difference is casey  didnt set out to get famous (as far as i know)
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ethan thought she was a jerk but she’s just shy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea no, it just happened
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TRU
Bill: Would hang with her, will never get the chance, won't lose sleep over it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that the girl who shows up in my recommended friends list all the time in gremlins cosplay???? i wanna gremlins friend
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think I could def get along with her but i dont want her to think imma fan girl XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh the texas girl
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea thats her
N🆗ri (Marisa): !!!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): casey sanders
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh gremlins girl is texas girl?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nah shes from like VA
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): texas girl is casey too, but different
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s movin in with jake soon too ;3c
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): different caseys
N🆗ri (Marisa): why people gotta have the same names :0
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Shame
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why don’t we have a name hunger games so people don’t get confused
N🆗ri (Marisa): when i left japan another girl named Marisa immediately joined the program and my classmates always text me about her and how she replaced me and i tell them i'm gonna come back just to fight her
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess u gotta fight your coworkers
Aldus Larian (Jess): im still amazind theres not another Jess in like BNE or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): before you merge into one mega jess
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~we forcibly make them change their name before entering~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theres anna now in bne and every time someone calls  "anna" i look at them and im like oh wait
N🆗ri (Marisa): you're the french version
N🆗ri (Marisa): le anna
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): do people call you anna?:O
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no but i often only hear the end part of my name
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I get that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or people call me "lee"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If I hear the soft g of Georgia I’m like wut
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea i feel you
Aldus Larian (Jess): I hear my name when people say "yes"
Aldus Larian (Jess): which is alot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats rough buddy
Aldus Larian (Jess): or "jeff"
Aldus Larian (Jess): combined with the fact its just a really commone name so i hear it all the time being called in stores and stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): i go into an immediate fight or flight response when someone says my name because that usually means something is wrong <:woah:543194447345876998>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no D:
N🆗ri (Marisa): unless it's my sister, i just realized she calls me 'maris' and without that final syllable i don't panic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What about mars
Aldus Larian (Jess): should i call you something else?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I maWisa ok?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Big. Hard. Nope
N🆗ri (Marisa): mars is what japanese photographers call me hehehe u gotta say it with a japanese accent
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~shaves head~*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAOfdjkghfd;
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooo no
Bill: Marsu?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): grow your hair out REALLY long
Bill: or... Marusu?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _anna no that’s awkward_
N🆗ri (Marisa): anything is fine just <:pew:543202259085950996> just use my name for times of emergencies and anything else just summon me through a pentagram
N🆗ri (Marisa): forcible hair extraction
Aldus Larian (Jess): mawisa it is
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Erik say it’s too late you’re being the dog
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just gonna pretend I didn't see it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Erik’s too busy working at work to read discord LMAO
Bill: While on subject of photographers, clouds of sand? The one Rebecca shoots with all the time? I don’t think she does a great job with Rebecca’s stuff.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She does good editing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like the green stuff she did for Rebecca’s Deku
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Very dark photos tho
Bill: Clouds has some skill but a lot of the ones I see of Rebecca feel half assed. Maybe I’m crazy but.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~she might be tired of shooting the same person~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because her other stuff is pretty good
Bill: ~~oh man are you supposed to get tired of that~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~fuck~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): well
Bill: ~~R.I.P. Georgia~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hunters photos look astronomically better when hes shooting something he likes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or with someone he likes
Bill: And then Tom Jess and Georgia murdered Leanna.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and half assed when he does stuff like black sun
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Clouds made my Blake look really good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and it seems like clouds has a similar issue
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): her stuff is great most of the time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but sometimes rebeccas stuff specifically comes out eh
Bill: That’s very true tho. I’ve been noticing it myself and since I do photos for fun not money or fame, I only want shoot fun cosplay/people.
Bill: ~~tldr the same things I always shoot~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah she may get tired of shooting rebecca
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH hunters photos ARE like that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He smashed me and caseys bumblebee shoot but idk how he’s done with other pics I’ve gotten from him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like BNHA from Geekdom, and now I’m not sure about Fallout from Katsu
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he did incredible on me and wish's bees
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but then he showed me photos on his camera
Bill: Mm... even those were a bit odd. He had this zoom far out thing going and it looks like shit on Instagram.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): of a black sun shoot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and it looked.... really.... not good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bias towards bees lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he needs to crop his photos during editing, with the right instagram ratio
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but otherwise they look good
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean it makes sense, Cosplaying things you enjoy and are passionate about is always more fun than cosplaying stuff you are not passionate about so i think cosplay photography would be the same
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^^^
Bill: I’d hate to pay 45 dollars and get lesser quality cause Photographer doesn’t like ship. I’d rather have a photog who doesn’t care about the series in particular and is just doing the shoot than that. (Generally, not on Hunter)
Bill: I don’t... think I’ve zoned out on any ships. I like couples and romance generally. I zone the fuck out when the group gets too big though.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i would gladly pay specifically hunter for any rwby shoot as long as its not a ship he doesnt like.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if i know he doesnt like the ship then i know im gonna get back meh photos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but thats hunter specific
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *good thing I'm doing a bee shoot with him at Zenkai*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you'll get fantastic photos back then lmao
Bill: It’s like knowing the cosplayer but I’m reverse.
Aldus Larian (Jess): passion plays a role in all creative areas
Bill: There are things I’d do with Georgia I won’t do with Jess, cause I start to know what works best for each of the@.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, you good at that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 👉😎👉
Bill: Thank?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you tend to capture everyones strong suit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh and ya know, JPaden always wanted to do pictures based on fanart
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m glad you don’t do that bill
Bill: ~~I used to remember~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You had references but JPaden shoots down most things that don’t have a reference image
Aldus Larian (Jess): bold of you to assume i have a strong suir
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its everything jess
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): youre good at everything
Bill: Oh I see. I was a little confused leanna, I thought you meant you’d seen the differences and I was like “have you been stalking my shoots?”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you're really good at being married
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): better than any of us
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): with the exception of maybe Tom
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): I almost just fell over in my chair at work but thank you 🙏
Bill: But it’s another one of the things I like about shooting with the same group often.
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom is p. good at being married
N🆗ri (Marisa): photos are weird
like i think the original of this looks better than the edit now
but......... feel like i gotta edit something
Bill: Fair Georgia. I gave up references... Katsu last year I think. Helped me transition as I got into the scene.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NO MAWISA YOU PERF
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I especially like Marisa’s commentary while shooting
N🆗ri (Marisa): GEORGIA IS SO PRO SHE STAYED SO STOIC
N🆗ri (Marisa): wasn't even moved by beyonce
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa, did you shop that things hanging down out?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i just noticed that i think it was a mistake of my eraser pen oops
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA marisa gives great motivation while shooting
Bill: All this chat this morning makes me want a like, non professional Yelp .
Aldus Larian (Jess): OO ok i thought you editted it out and i was like " 😮 "
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've edited out big things before though! like, entire major costume repairs and reconstructing shoes and stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): i did recreate someone's face once but i don't think i have the original
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was a girl in japan and the sun was reflecting off her goggles so you couldn't see her eyes at all
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _mars is good photographer_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _we need more of her_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and her free commentary
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok but have you heard of this guy tape worm? what a pro
Bill: Both cause I want to fish for compliments and cause I always want to know what people “really” think.
Bill: Mawisa you are very good. Enough to gimme a twinge on the inferiority complex.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah this girl!!! we still follow each other on twitter though i forget her username. she's so nice.
i recreated her left eye because there was too much glare and you couldn't see it but i should go back and redo her right eye since it looks warped <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u

Bill: Oh yeah. No I just like to talk about photographer.
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru's photography school exclusive to meetup dot com bring noodles and $500
Bill: *one day* I’ll go to a con photographer meetup.
Bill: I could reopen a tellonym/ask box and post “hey ~~roast~~ review me”.
Bill: It’d get 1 reply, Marisa’s, which would be incredibly sweet but.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no i already started planning my reply which will be one of millions u get
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): one of _milliomd_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ns_
Bill: I opened it, did a couple things involving it, no one uses it, I got sad and deleted it.
Bill: What happened to Sarahah too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hope she's in the new animal crossing switch game
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think Tellonym occasionally sends auto messages because I see some people get the same very generic questions
Bill: It’s a hypocritical complaint, I’m not the best at engagement on things either so.
Bill: Does tellonym have a word limit?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe, but you can get a hefty paragraph in at least
N🆗ri (Marisa): send u the script for high school musical
Bill: you were right Erik.
Bill: Judging by the amount of crap I copy and pasted into *wise rice's* ask box, the character limit is a non factor for a review type of thing.
Bill: Alright, we'll try it.
Bill: I should make a post too, but fuck it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!245270932602486784> I just got added to that giant cosplay group message on Facebook O.o

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought this was like, a long-existing group chat but I scrolled all the way up and it was just started yesterday around noon
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof

N🆗ri (Marisa): how long were you willing to spend scrolling that could've taken you eternity :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I.... don't know....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the RTX one?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is that what it is?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Dank Memes and Cosplay Dreams*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh it might be older and maybe there's a message limit. because the beginning of the chat is like, mid conversation
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh yeah thats def been a thing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): who invited you?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that chat is a heckin mess

Aldus Larian (Jess): that was like a whole week damn
N🆗ri (Marisa): we finished the chocopies in like 20 minutes but non-chocolate u gotta stretch out
Elfriede Faun (Tom): DAYUM
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I prob couldn't have finished it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Dominoes prob would have killed me after a few days
Elfriede Faun (Tom): **Sosalt** <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): domino himself manifests in your fridge and dehydrates you to death
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o i like dominoes cause the bread is thicc
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That is 100 percent absolutely what I envisioned
Glonk: 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I like it but after like 3 slices the salt kills me inside
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like most of the pizza chains minus the Hut
N🆗ri (Marisa): this kills the tom
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I really wanna try Chicago style
Bill: Uno has that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ethan just texted me to see if I wanted to play DnD via computer when Austin visits him in a couple weeks 😑
Bill: ~~your too busy playing in the game I started twenty minutes ago~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I actually have an excuse. I get too distracted if it's not in person. I played via Skype a few times and it was not great
Bill: Tellonym gives push notifications right?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yea
Bill: Wonderful.
Bill: I should make a folder of “apps that will only notify me with notifications from the developer”.
Bill: Bumble and CMB being the others that come to mind.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've been having issues with some of my apps and I think it's due to the Samsung update a few weeks ago
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like I have a to-do list app that's supposed to remind me of tasks but it doesn't anymore
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I don't have notifications turned off for it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also my weather app keeps disabling the ongoing temperature notification in my notifications bar
