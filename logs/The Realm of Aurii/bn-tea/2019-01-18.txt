> Never answered original question
Bill: I’m parked, haven’t said anything in 5 minutes: “as I’m sure you’re figuring...”
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): see thats why i dont call people
Bill: At this point I just want to shell out for both.
Bill: Cause like. He just rattled off a million things I can do with each. Also he prefers flashes ~~and I don’t love his style so the opposite may be smart~~
Bill: ~~Buy both because decision too hard~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if got the money i guess
Bill: I mean I don’t want to do that. Or I shouldn’t, I gotta work on impulse shopping.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): maybe talk to other cosplay photographers?
Bill: I know what Hunter uses... Rebecca doesn’t use lights...
Bill: Could see about Zeikani but I don’t think she has lights.
Bill: Other than that... Dunno who else.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): can you ask on a con photography group on facebook?
Bill: I’m in a few of those... It’s a tad weird cause I don’t want to say I’m doing boudoir, which is admittedly a big part of the purchase... ~~I also have to value that I’m buying these for like, one shoot?~~
Bill: They’d still be useful for general indoor tho, like MM slumber party. Speedlights could be generally useful.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my inclination would be 1 soft box would be enough but i dont know know much
Bill: It’s a two kit.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive olny used soft box and unbrella
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): dont spend a bunch of money if you think its only gonna be for one shoot
Bill: I’d like it to be more than one shoot. I love doing this.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): dude idk what to tell you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): id say go with soft boxes cuz i personally dont like flashes since i cant get an idea of the lighting beofre taking a shot
Bill: Truth. I traditionally find them annoying too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Flashes make everything spotty for like 10 minutes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea soft boxes are easier on te eyes than eny other option too
N🆗ri (Marisa): Flash lighting looks really bad if you’re in the atrium at night too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but i dont think they are allowing stand lighting at all inside the con
N🆗ri (Marisa): O ya that’s illegal
I was using a hand flash a few years ago
Bill: These speedlights can just be off camera, reduced power, have diffusers, can be angle for bounce flash... they fancy. I wanted to believe the flash could do both... but mm... not feeling it.
Bill: I think I’ll do the two softbox kit and a flash for the sake of having it. I can get the other flash later, use the same stand from the soft boxes, just need a mount.... ~~this is just dropping two things~~
Bill: Still, that’s 200 bucks cheaper.
Bill: Back under what I originally expected to pay too.
Bill: There was a meme awhile back “signs you grew up lonely”?
Bill: I didn’t need to have the perspective to notice those things.
Bill: Toys acquired.
Bill: Not sure why cow and bear but TANK MAWISA.
N🆗ri (Marisa): They’re toys!
Bill: I guess!
Bill: I’ll have to test this stuff before Katsu.... <:mew_face:498866691963355137>
Bill: Oh. So the amazon version of the flash comes with diffuser and color gels... for the same price.
Bill: ,... all sold by different sellers.
Bill: With minimal reviews.
Bill: and it's a chinese brand.
Bill: They sold me a signal receiver instead of transmitter...!
Bill: Idiots.
Bill: Now I need to go back there and return this, cause why would my CAMERA need to receive the signal that my CAMERA took a photo.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Damn
Bill: They sold me the light kit.
Bill: Without.
Bill: The fucking bulbs.
Bill: WHAT THE FUCK.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how many manufacturers does it take to screw in a lightblub
Bill: None, there's no fucking light bulbs.
Bill: So now I have to jack ass back there.
Bill: SO much for my new toys.
Bill: ~~maybe this is a sign I should return the shit and be done with it~~
