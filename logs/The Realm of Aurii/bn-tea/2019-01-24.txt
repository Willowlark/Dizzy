Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hals playin with another girl now and i think she thinks hes flirtin
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes comin off as flirtin
Dirty Lego (Tom): Classic
Dirty Lego (Tom): 🙏
Bill: This weather is killing my skin.
Bill: It’s never been this dry, and certainly not so wide spread.
Bill: Can’t sleep, too uncomfortable.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah it's been so dry lately
Dirty Lego (Tom): Even I'm getting dry hands and I'm pretty resistant to it
Bill: I just had to douse myself in moisturizer. Hopefully it keeps the itchy scratch feelings away long enough I can crash.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): am i the only one that finds the "reasons" people are fucked up and do fucked up things highly interesting as well as the whole "duality of man" kinda thing like charles manson fucking led a cult and convinced people to murder people for him but he was abused his entire childhood by his prostitute mother. like it doesnt excuse but it gives insight into why hes fucked up
Bill: is this about Leanna trying to shut down *literally anything* other than loathing for Adam.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yeet
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean u can still loathe his but getting a backstory makes him even more human/even scarier/more real villiany
Bill: yup. I want to know why Blake is afraid of him, because that will make me afraid for her.
Bill: I enjoyed Jessica Jones so much because I was *scared* for her.
Bill: The stakes against her were high and personal.
N🆗ri (Marisa): one of my classes was on deviant behavior and our assigned textbooks were absolutely horrifying if you ever want some readings on sociopaths
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~plz~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): the one i remember the most is Tiger Tiger, which is a memoir written by a girl who was groomed by a pedophile
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like i want reasons people do things
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm trying to remember the name of another book. it was about teenage girls who were parts of inner city gangs. it had a really gaudy cover.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like i guess i just dont believe people are born evil?
Bill: They aren't... I'd argue like, Hitler, but I'm not a historian.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 8 Ball Chicks: A Year in the Violent World of Girl Gangs
Bill: Adam can't have started evil though; not entirely. He didn't (afaik) force Blake into a relationship with him. At some point, she found him attractive and interesting.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I doubt Hitler was born evil
Dirty Lego (Tom): Some people have real mental disorders that makes them dissociate from other people's experiences and that can make them dangerous if they end up sociopathic
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye there's a big debate between nature and nurture and no one really has any clue which it is. some people are born lacking empathy and it's obvious from a very young age that they are dangerous. they can learn to act and grow up 'normally' but are wholly apathetic to anyone else.
or people can feel empathy but it's highly selective and disregards anyone outside of a small circle
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea that shit is facinating
N🆗ri (Marisa): i haven't gotten caught up on rwby but i don't think adam is a textbook sociopath <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe he is because i haven't seen the new stuff but he didn't come off as one in the earlier seasons. not saying he's a good person at all, just that he didn't come off as a major sociopath based on the textbook definition
Dirty Lego (Tom): Did you watch the Adam short?
Dirty Lego (Tom): That gives a bit more insight
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea theyre are other types of "bad peeps" too
Dirty Lego (Tom): Also yes
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw, episodes were blocked on youtube in japan and i haven't gotten caught up yet. but i dont mind spoilers. i kind of know what happens because everyone was bad at keeping it in the spoiler tag lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): is adam on the level of dahmer or bundy
Dirty Lego (Tom): The Adam short is a quick watch and good
Dirty Lego (Tom): It on YouTube it hink
N🆗ri (Marisa): i really want to jump in the discussion but i don't want to start an argument
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah Leanna has been way too engrossed in all this since the episode and she seemed ready to argue with anyone but it seems like she's finally backing down a bit
Dirty Lego (Tom): I mean you can say what you want for sure, but not having seen the episodes will prob put you at a disadvantage
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): all these people fighting about adam and i just leaned Joe from You was based on a real person
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not THATS scary
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye i just don't want misinformation spreading around and my major can be of use for once ;u;
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh wait nvm this artice title may be  misleading
N🆗ri (Marisa): misleading titles?? on the internet???????
N🆗ri (Marisa): send in a complaint
Bill: Thought of a zing for Leanna: "You know it's been like, 5 days and all we've talked about is Adam. What about the beeeeees"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~Im sick of bees and adam~~
Bill: I'm... starting to think Leanna associated with more than just Yang in this triangle. Potentially bad relationship in the past, she has extra hatred for Adam because she's projecting.
Bill: It would make sense...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): could be!
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i've been thinking the same. maybe it reminds her of something she saw or experienced idk
N🆗ri (Marisa): my mother has been watching 9/11 documentaries all week so i've been looking into some disasters again. interesting how jonestown was the 6th biggest disaster in US history.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and like no one talks about it
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's up with that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like it gets mentioned whenever cults are discussed and everyone knows the "kool aid"joke but thats it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah they have audio of the whole massacre
N🆗ri (Marisa): people who didn't drink were shot
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i heard some of that on a documentary once
N🆗ri (Marisa): my disasters professor is from new orleans and did research there after katrina and he had some horribly sad stories
N🆗ri (Marisa): one of the people he was interviewing said they were on the roof of the house as it was floating in the floodwaters, and the house had a ^ shaped roof so he was laying on the point with one hand holding on to his young daughter on one side and the other hand holding on to his mother on the other side. the house hit a tree hard and he couldn't maintain his grip on both so he had to let go of his mother. i think they found her crushed under another house after the flood waters receded.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH GOD 😦
N🆗ri (Marisa): the disaster prevention center in tokyo has a cool movie about 3/11 too that i wish was online because it has a lot of footage of the flood that isn't available online
N🆗ri (Marisa): some good movies coming out in 2019. some happy movies that are good and not tragic and i'm looking forward to them.
Dirty Lego (Tom): That was a neet read about jonestown
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was planning historical stuff to be included in mawisaquest months back and jonestown was one of the things i was considering for inspiration if the plot ever went in a culty direction
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Fucking crazy right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i thought that discussion was in animememes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's crazy that now we can get video of all these things
N🆗ri (Marisa): have you ever seen The Wind Rises
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no, whats that?
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a ghibli movie. i really like their portrayal of the 1923 earthquake
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have the dvd if anyone ever wants to watch it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): movie marathon night
Bill: *Ash appears*
Dirty Lego (Tom): Youre gonna summon her
Dirty Lego (Tom): Also yes I want to see all the ghiblis
Bill: anime movie night and korean spas.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): plz
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Hewwo I felt some food vibes coming from thsi chat
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Good vibes*
N🆗ri (Marisa): swolfy walks in after all the lewd talk
good good
N🆗ri (Marisa): protec
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Am I protecting against the lewd or protecting the lewd?
Dirty Lego (Tom): ~~if you think she doesn't like to talk about lewd stuff you have a storm coming~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes
Bill: that looks INCREDIBLY similar to Mom's office.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I LITERALLY WAS GONNA COMMENT ABOUT THAT STORY
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I hate ethan for saying that those chokers are like “black belts for dick sucking”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Because anytime I see those I can’t help but think about that, no matter who’s wearing it
Bill: ~~well I doubt it's about the background looking like my mom's work~~
Bill: It true.
Bill: I think it too.
Bill: Lissy always has one, afaik.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i wear those 😭  sometimes, so does <@!325788935865368578>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHY ETHAN DO THIS
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like I didn’t plan on wearing them bUT NOW I DEFINITELY WONT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~ill be DSC but only for one (1) man~~
Bill: Scenes from a Hat: What if other communities had callout culture like Cosplay?
Bill: I'm just picturing the 50~60 year olds in the club last night calling out some other 50~60 year old.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): How do you know they don't?
Bill: 😯
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like I'm sure they do. If someone is dangerous you give heads up to your friends
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't think it's exclusive to the Cosplay community
Bill: Mm. It's not (in theory) a bad thing. Cosplay's much more... vocal? about it than most.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But like are you involved in other communities to this extent?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like for example of you were involved in like the club scence and there was a guy like drugging girls or a girl mugging guys I'm sure things would be posted about it within those community groups
Bill: Hopefully.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Other hobbies have callout posts over weird stuff too. “This person gets wood from Home Depot instead of planting and harvesting their own trees!” type of weird. 

Lots of drama in crafting communities
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean calling out someone over crafting or cosplay itself is dumb but calling out people for being dangerous isn't
Bill: Certainly not.
