Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and maybe put a note inside for who its for? like a tag?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and it ok i only have it on DND because its finals week, im not studying right now ll
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's a letter because mailing a package would cost $25+, so the gifts are all flat >_<
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeee thats fine too
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): thank ye very much!!
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I'll put some washi tape on the back with the name under it so y'all can peel off the tape to see who it's for
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm very excited to go back to fushimi-inari next week. my inn is like 10 minutes away on foot so i'm gonna go at the crack of dawn each day to take selfies.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i probably won't climb the mountain every morning
but at least a little jaunt
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YAY
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): youve been there before?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's this place
i hear there are bears and boars when no one else is around
exciting
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah!! once in 2016
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i did a semester abroad and they took us to Kyoto and two girls locked left one drunk guy in an irish pub and he almost missed the hotel curfew (some hotels lock the door at night)
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): and not like 1am, the curfew was at like 11 or something
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that's why i'll probably get up really early to go. it's a major tourist attraction but crowds usually don't start showing up until 7am and trains don't start until 6am. everything I want to do will likely close by 5-6pm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): O NO
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the moral of the lesson is don't drink and trust no one <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what can you do there?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's basically a giiiiiant shrine complex that stretches across a whole mountain. The bottom and the top and several rest points along the way have shops. You can admire the view, get some ice cream or finger food (like taiyaki or takoyaki), admire the scenery. 

it's also kind of maze-y because there isn't just one straight path up the mountain. it forks a lot and they all kind of look similar. there are hundreds if not thousands of tiny shrines along the way
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the big shrine is at the bottom but there are a TON of tiny shrines like this all lining the pathways
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i like the ones with lots of little statues
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG THATS SO NEAT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): HAVE FUN!
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): thank!!! i hope the little statues are happy. i get lots of souvenirs for all.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): also people draw faces on the ema
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): idk what else i'll do yet tbh but i'd go to kyoto just for fushimi inari.
i'm doing day trips to other surrounding towns most days ~~so maybe i'll just do fushimi oops~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm mega disappointed the atomic bomb museum is under renovations so half of it is closed. hhhhhhhhhhhhhh that's tied for what i'm looking forward to the most. history is great.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm rambling now <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you can still go to the museum though right? just half of it wont be open?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that souns really neat though
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): there's a museum 20 minutes away by foot that I've been meaning to visit all year and I'm finally going tomorrow, it shows how everyday life in tokyo used to be several hundred years ago.

yeah! the east wing is open so there's still exhibitions open.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the museum at yasukuni shrine was fascinating. it was cool to see information about Pearl Harbor from a non-US perspective
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OO That sounds cool too!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo yea that had to be really interesting
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): they had a display with the names and pictures of all the kamikaze pilots who did pearl harbor, honoring them for their service. it wasn't in a glorified way, but it was a show of respect and is a big example of the whole "two sides to every penny" argument. in school I just learned 'big mean japanese pilots kill people' but here they were heroes
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the museum is anti-war and even had veterans wandering around sharing stories to anyone who would listen, but the entire shrine is a memorial to all Japanese who have fought and died in war whether it was good or bad. it's very controversial because there are some big name war criminals enshrined there.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh yea definitely, the way the US teaches history is very. "The US never did anything wrong, ever"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it can demonize other counties in a very dehumanizing way imo
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah!!!
sometimes that happens in japan too. they refuse to acknowledge some wrongdoings from the past.

my history teacher in 2016 (i spent a semester here for credit in my junior year) assigned us parts of history to do for our final presentations and another girl and I did it on the rape of nanking. the death toll is highly disputed between Japan and China and is somewhere around 20,000 to 300,000 people, with most legitimate sources having proof for the upper end of that (around 200k). our teacher kept cutting into the presentation to be like, "yeah the chinese just want money from our government. the actual number is much lower."
デイブ: This the new general chat <:lenny:395307171539189760>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah it is

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i saw she had a lighter purpley color
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): lol someone i know is putting together a bnha bunny group and they need the invisible girl
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh yea im sure the trend follows for other countries too. theres a way to honor your dead without glorifying what they were made to do. propaganda always plays a part. I think people usually believe they are on the "right side" until everything is said and done
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah!!!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): how do you cosplay an invisible girl?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cover yourself in mirrors
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that's what i was thinking lol
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): paint yourself cam
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it could probably be done by just putting wire in a bunny suit

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THATS SO COOL

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ha haha yeaaa.....
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean for him, yes its hard for him to know he is flirting
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): one way i identify flirting by a persons attempt to touch the other person
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hal is v. touchy
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i wanna see him touch someone and they instinctively suplex him
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): SUPLEXING IS BADASS
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): tom you should suplex greg next time you see him
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He too tol I cannot
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It’s just...... to say “I can’t tell when I’m flirting”...... it makes someone come off as a jerk????
