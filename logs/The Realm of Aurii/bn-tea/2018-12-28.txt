Bill: Meg: OT3
Me: You mean Bakuraka?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~you mean an agry boi and 2 cuties that are too good for him?~~
Bill: SAVAGE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Who said that? Not me na-uh
Bill: 👌
Bill: ~~I'd rather confront Meg about her and Hal than tell her I don't see literally any reason to ship Kiribaku~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LMAO
Bill: Not even in the 'bash your ship' way. Just to say I personal disagree with it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean I see why people ship it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But I don't personally ship it
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i think she's in it a little deep and is warping canon
it has popularity here, i saw a doujin in a store the other day for it, but she describes their personalities different from how they canonically are
Bill: Ye.
Bill: She's pretty rabid.
Bill: That's not *bad*, but it's at the point where I don't want to ever talk to her about it.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He’s projectingggg
Bill: she?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean that yes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): My phone really needs a new battery or something cause its slowness forces typos on me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I’m a cheap thot that doesn’t wanna pay more for mah phone
Bill: Projecting... what?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Projecting what she wants out of a relationship onto her ship
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Kirishima and Bakugo don’t get serious after all 😏
Bill: 🔫 🥃
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tea shot?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Bourbon gun
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Alcohol pistol
Bill: 🥃 🔥
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Fire tea
Bill: *shots. fired.*
Bill: Anyway I don't think that's it.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Maybe she just have that obsessive personality
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She said Sam put too much of Arkos into their relationship but she must have liked it to a degree to wanna commit to him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): To my knowledge they screwed like right after being Jaune and Pyrrha all day two RTX sho
Bill: sure?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea she def has her own personalities for them
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i feel like she would enjoy killing stalking
Bill: 
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Super late but yeah she's doing that thing people do where they give characters personalities that they don't have based on their own mind and fanfiction. Not that there's anything wrong with that in it's own sense, but damn is she passionate about them.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I don't know her well enough to comment on any psychological implications
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): This is just begging to be meme’d
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): young jack black scares me
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): LMAO
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yo apparently a. Movie just came out called Hal too
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It was pretty high on the rotten tomato charrts
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Along with Mirai <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  birus total on cons could be less since he is only one person, and he doesnt cosplay
Bill: Uh?
Bill: Ah. BNE.
Bill: If you’re counting cosplay materials, I could count photography gear.
Bill: I’ve tried to keep track of con costs, but because of all the splits and cash payments it’s hard.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i only did a rough estimate i have no record of how much exactly each hotel cost at all
Bill: In total or for you two?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): for us
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if you add up con, hotels, cosplay, food, parking the number is 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but that is for 2 people so it makes sense it is so high
Bill: Yeah you paying for two. Can’t split things by couples because lol.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i could look at pay pay records but meh
Bill: I could get the version history of the con shortlist, but also meh.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i have at least a number i should try to be UNDER for this year so thats enough
Bill: Don’t forget parking is usually a late split tho.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i kinda estimated that from what i remember
Bill: I’d spit ball 5 to 8 hundred a con? Including swag.
Bill: No photography gear counting, cause it’s multipurpose.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea about that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): a little lower
Bill: I’ve always considered a weekend con costing around 500 minimum, as a safe number.
Bill: You guys could just bring cash for the con? Set you spend limit, subtract if you’ve pay pal’d for the room, only spend that cash at con?
Bill: Credit cards at cons are doing the devils work.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I have adjusted my price but it's still prob 5 grand somehow
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LOL
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im just gonna start camping outside
Bill: ~~650 is the average of the spitball, that’s 3900 for 6 overnights~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im just try gonna keep a better eye on the cost this year if i can
Bill: 🙌
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): adjust as needed. six people in a room vs 4 makes huge differences in cost so its hard to predict
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): ILL ADJUST IT TO 4
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): FINAL OFFER
Bill: ~~whose heads on the chopping block then?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WAT
Bill: *He’s adjusting 6 people to 4*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): HE MEANT 4K XD
Bill: *If you include the d500 it’d be 6+!*
Bill: Sure that’s the right react? XD
Bill: Unrelated: I’m a tad concerned for Rei.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea 😦 idk what goin on
<@!245270932602486784>  have you talked to rei?

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): They are?/were? In a polyamorous relationship with two other people online
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea maybe some relationship trouble? They asked if anyone was available to hang out this weekend to take their mind off stuff. Im assuming they are coming to NYE at least right?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ye they are
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And damn I’d offer to hang with them but my weekends booked solid
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So at least NYE is Monday
Bill: Seems like a break up.
Bill: To me.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea at least nye is clos tot he weekend
Bill: A weekend can be a long time...
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah but two days to chill with lots of people ain't bad
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): In the meantime I'm sure rei will find people to hang with
Bill: Much like Kiribaku, I don’t want to actually say I think the undercut is far less cute than the original bob. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i was aabout to call u out but then i didnt
Bill: ?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i was about to say "Birus just advocating for the bob since he doesn't like undercuts"
Bill: Oof that would have made me look terrible, thanks for not.
Bill: 🙏
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lmao i dont think u need to thank me for not throwing you ender the bus XD
Bill: ~~also like my opinion of what’s cute matters in people’s choices~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t like the undercut or piercing either
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Thanks for swooping in LOL
Bill: ~~swooping in would imply I said I have preference in BNE~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah but they started talking about how hot the piercing was when you mentioned the other haircut
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I feel like I just can’t openly disagree with Meg hm hm
Bill: Missed that.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh is this about Leanna doing it?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Does she have an eyebrow piercing now?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Noooo spidergwen has the piercing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Leanna's considering getting the undercyt if she can't find a wig
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oo okay
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh she has 2 dif styles
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I like the Bob better too although I like that one as well
