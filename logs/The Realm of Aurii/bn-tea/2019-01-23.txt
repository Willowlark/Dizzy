Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): game?
N🆗ri (Marisa): WAIT WHOS DOING THat
N🆗ri (Marisa): I COSPLAH REMILIA
Bill: Yes... but it’s fandom is the defining point.
Bill: Audrey, Marks daughter.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I DOSPLAY REMEILIA WE SHOUDK DONA SHOOT
Bill: She said Zenkai. Ask her.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I also cosplay Reimu but Remilia fits better with Flandre they’re sisters
N🆗ri (Marisa): social interaction............
Bill: FUCKING DO IT.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is she in BNE
Bill: Too aggressive wait nevermind.
N🆗ri (Marisa): we aren’t following each other on Instagram so it’d be weird to send something out of the blue
Bill: She used to be. She left, according to Mark we’re a bit too old for to relate to.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: You met her at Konkon!
Bill: She was Oscar!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye I’m an old creep
Bill: No?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ll get flora to be my flandre instead some day
N🆗ri (Marisa): [casually schedules a cosplay around her schedule and bumps into her “randomly”] wow what a coincidence
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): whats the fandom?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Touhou Project
N🆗ri (Marisa): I wanna cosplay Marisa owo
Bill: I’m shooting her sat of Katsu (she mipha) you can come and ask her then.
N🆗ri (Marisa): pew pew pew
YEAH
Bill: I’m not too into touhou, marisa explain.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Operation ask is a go
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a game with a lot of girls and a lot of shooting but cool music
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s many games
N🆗ri (Marisa): They’re all fanmade there’s nothing official
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a community made fandom by the community for the community
Bill: With lots of waifus. And doujin.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Though Zun started it so he’s the official official of the community
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s technically entirely spiking
N🆗ri (Marisa): Doujin
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oof
Bill: Like it’s just the game. Which didn’t have dialogue or any real plot... then the fandom took over and defined everything else.
N🆗ri (Marisa): These are some of the more popular characters
N🆗ri (Marisa): There is a plot and some small dialogue in the games. It starts with Reimu being broke and Marisa stealing her shrine’s offering box and then goes on from there
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hmm
Bill: *some*
N🆗ri (Marisa): The games are fun sometimes when they aren’t horribly rage inducing
Bill: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou?from=VideoGame.Touhou tvtropes covers the gist fairly well.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think tom playeed something that looked like that on playstation
Bill: I think it was a different game. Shikigami something.
Bill: I had the wii port and we played it once.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea that sounds right
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): too much going on on the screen for me
Bill: Oh I can't play bullet hells for shit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): You just gotta focus on your character and pray nothing goes wonky
Dirty Lego (Tom): I played the first touhou
Dirty Lego (Tom): And yeah just focus on your character and dodging
Dirty Lego (Tom): And hope you hit the while holding the fire button
Dirty Lego (Tom): Then hit the nope button to clear the screen if you corner yourself
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i have bad coordination
Bill: I can't even manage to switch guarding crouch to standing in time.
