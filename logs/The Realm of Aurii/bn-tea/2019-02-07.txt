my cousin's wedding is this weekend and i haven't seen most of the family in at least 5 years so i'm gonna act cool and aloof to ward away weird questions
Bill: Be sure to push up your glasses anytime you say something.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): "have you met any nice guys yet?"
"yeah i met this guy at the bank, really nice customer service."
scarf down 12 mini quiches
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Awkward family questions are the best
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'll counter with really aggressive questions. "i dunno aunt linda, is your son still addicted to narcotics and passing out in random store bathrooms every day?"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): There ya go
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmaooo
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): my uncle used to crack really perverted jokes and always ask weird innuendo laden questions and i would answer super naively. that will be fun to do again.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): like once before a con he asked "so all the girls are in these skimpy outfits? they like to show off? maybe i'll come with you" and i'd be like "oh yes there are fashion shows and many wonderful craftsman competitions they put so much time and dedication into the outfits they're all wonderful, there are even how-to panels i'll take you to where you can learn how to make them too" and he just sighed
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): *i wonder why his daughter was obsessed with babies and got pregnant the moment she turned 18*
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): there's an odd number of men in my family who thought playboy bunny accessories were cute gifts to give their daughters and their friends
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): when they were like, 5

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is this a cousin of yours?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My friend's dad did merchandising for Playboy and give me undies and stuff and my dad found them while doing laundry and was like "you shouldn't have these you're lie 14'
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): jade is my one cousin who's obsessed with babies and had one the first moment she could. her child is huge like he weighed 16 pounds and did not look like a newborn when he was born.
key is a close family friend who's close enough to be considered family i guess
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah!!! why do they make that stuff!!!!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh. Important point my friend gave me the stuff not her dad
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ok phew

Dirty Lego (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): how low are the chances of me finding someone ace who can put up with me that i can drag to family events to silence their questioning
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): "yes this is my destined soulmate we're taking out many loans to buy a boat and sail to greenland where we'll open a maid cafe."
Bill: Maybe!
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): every time they inquire about this person we make up a more ridiculous backstory
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i'll hire someone on craigslist
Bill: You should go to the pride parade Leanna went to last year!
