Bill: Dan (Sun with abs) is making a corset for laniebug. Lanie... pointed out she gay too?
Bill: And he put initials... that aren’t? Aren’t there’s on the corset?
Bill: Much hmm.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): where is that happening? nothing on facebook or instagram
Bill: Her story.
Bill: ~~drama that’s not related to anyone here is refreshingly interesting~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): who's laniebug i can't find her on instagram
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~give us the drama~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lol it's not dramam dude
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): J and F stand for Jester and Fjord, a lesbian couple from critical roll
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh wait maybe fjords a dude
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NVM fjords a dude but anyway that's what the j and f stand for
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): this is a different lanie than the lanie who i staff with right? who cosplays harley quinn and comic characters
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): @laiinybug
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): omg she has such a good haruhi cosplay
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The character she is making the corset for is gay tho so she might just be saying that.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): someone teach me how to cosplay good
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): no it must be drama
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's a deep mystery we have to solve
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You're done! You now know how to cosplay good
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i missed a few steps and i think my foot is caught in the garbage disposal now
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): my new book is here it's in my mailbox i gotta go get it but i don't want to put on pants and my hair is still sticking up so pray no one sees me
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): BY NO PANTS I MEAN I'M WEARING A SKIRT but its cold
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Welcome to my trash kingdom I’m in the midst of packing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No pants
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): remember that jimmy neutron / fairly odd parents crossover episode. that was neat.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Barely
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): BIG drama happening in the homestuck fandom wow
how did this manage to hide from me for 24 hours
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): this stuff is really messed up. a lot about hitler? hussie apologized for it and says it was old stuff that got tossed but he thought it would be fun for the fandom to read? but it's bizarre
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): all of whatpumpkin was in on this, they changed their entire domain so *someone* had to have read it. and thought "oh yeah this is fine." I wonder if viz media is aware of any of this or had any part in it.
Bill: This sounds complicated.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): oh yeah. it's great. messed up.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it might push hiveswap production back even further? because these scrapped plot points were gonna be reintroduced in the next iteration of the game or something?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): basically homestuck's creator did a little easter egg, which was a sneaky release of some old plot ideas from before homestuck ever got big.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): one of the characters rapes another in front of hitler's decapitated head?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): and his blood is used to make the Insane Clown Posse, who are still servants of ICP if i remember canon correctly
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): here's the apology anyway
http://www.skaianetsystems.com/
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): rather than being out right racist, it looks like the content is just in very poor taste. it doesn't necessarily discriminate about any one group but it does turn very horrific events into simplified jokes, which made its readers uncomfortable
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): "Hussie posted some hidden Condesce/Earth backstory on the new Skaianet website that involved some problematic elements (mostly regarding Hitler, and Einstein causing the Holocaust) and seems to generally be regarded as bad, which led to some people getting upset and even calling him an antisemite. The files are gone now but there are archived versions"
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Good apology tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I fucking love Erik omg
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I told everyone on Halloween that my secret cosplay is Megara from Hercules
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I didn’t say it in BNE cause I’m wondering if it would be more fodder for Meg to dislike me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause I’ve wanted to do Megara for like YEARS but so has she
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So today I asked which cosplays people were most excited for and
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): FUCKIN ERIK
Bill: I mean.
Bill: He could just... want to see that?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The _smirk emoji tho_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Erik has a surprising amount of tea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He was talkin gossip on new year’s
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _hes come to the dark side_
Bill: He's always been interested, he just never wanted to be involved.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): mood
Bill: So... IBM changed the way they're doing things and I'm... not switching to the project I was going to. I'm now mostly unattached to a project.
Bill: As a billable employee that's... not good.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Uh oh 😮
Bill: This blind sided Gord too, hell even the project lead I was going to work with, so we're figuring it out now...
Bill: Like, the restructuring their doing for contractors is actually smart, but to do it *right now* is a bit inconvenient.
Bill: But they're doing it to make more resources available for more projects, so, it's not like I won't have a project.
Bill: that would be *really* bad.
Bill: <.<
Bill: >.>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I refollowed Sakurasan since she was at new year's and I'm in her bnha group now but damn I hate her posting method
Bill: Yuuuup
Bill: I still have a soft spot for her cause she noticed how stressed Katsu made me, but I can’t follower man.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): She follows Tom but not me 😂
Bill: I guess that’s only fair, how many people only follow you? XD
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's new
