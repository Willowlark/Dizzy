Bill: <@!245270932602486784> according to Hunter, Ethan and Casey are trying to come up for New Years...?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeee they are
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Damn
Bill: Didn’t know if you knew.
Bill: Poor Leanna. Not that she was really out of the ordinary, but I’m guess by her lack of appetite at dinner she’s down. Leo senses.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~ah, yes, another star sign would have never noticed one of the most tell tale symptoms of sadbess~~
Bill: *Yeah I had to consult my tarot cards and Luigi board to be sure*
Bill: ~~and that’s not even the point, I’m confirming I read the signal right cause I have a long track record of misreading/missing signals~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): LUIGI BOARD
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ok SO storytime
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): back when i was in high school, i was 14, and i did a lot of homestuck roleplay
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): (no naughty stuff, just like D&D style roleplay of the character on the homestuck roleplay client at the time)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and i remember that a whole group actually formed that would habitually roleplay together
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and everyone was age range like 12-19 which, hindsight, was weird
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): anyways i was 14 and i remember this random 19 year old dude kept comin onto me and always asking to roleplay weird stuff
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so eventually i got sick of him, left that roleplay group, and blocked him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): apparently today he remade his facebook and sent me an invite? like helloooo that was 6 years ago buddy boi no thank
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG CREEPY
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): RIGHT???
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean i blocked him so its all good, it was just weird he was trying to establish contact again
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): UGH
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Dayyum6 years later
