Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): That‚Äôs the law of the universe
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): YO
Deuce tried to recommend Labinnak and Mangaloo as Zenkaikon guests
That‚Äôs a little weird right
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): 
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Burlesque tends to be our only non-judge cosplay guest, and cosplay guests are absolutely worked to the bone. Most guests are.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I've seen her ask for people to suggest her before
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Does she compete? Usually if you compete at cons it‚Äôs a super easy way to get guest status. People who‚Äôve reached craftsman status or above can become judges which usually has a lot of prestige attached.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sometimes? I think?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): That‚Äôs good then! If she keeps goin she‚Äôll be more likely to get a guest spot üíÉ
Bill: Really awkward when the building staff comes over to our office with someone to show them the office, since we move rooms Monday.
Bill: I feel like a fish.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats how i feel when they do interviews
Bill: At least interviewees have some reason to be here, I dunno who tf that guy was.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): prob a guy looking to rent the space maybe?
Bill: exactly that ye. But that's it, interviewees I can introduce myself to for the 5 seconds Japneet brings them by.
Bill: This guy just like 'owo?'
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh when they bring interveiws by that literrally stop in the door way and dave goes "oh and thats jess" and then keeps walking
Bill: pretty much what Japneet's been doing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im ready for today to be over now
Bill: mood.
Bill: I got another 40 minutes before I can bail.
Bill: Nothing is getting done.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 1.5 hrs
Bill: Oof. Part of me wants to look at the last two years and see how my photography has improved, but I‚Äôm also low key scared I have improved at all.
