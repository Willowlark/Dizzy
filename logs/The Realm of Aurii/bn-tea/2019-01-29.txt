Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m trying not to beat on Hal too much but I don’t think he realizes that being all “it works just like a normal economy of course” comes off as such a know-it-all attitude
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LOL I saw that earlier and checked this chat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz I was like "ooo hes trying to make himself appear smarter than him"
N🆗ri (Marisa): I was waitin for someone to start tea on this. Wew.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think he realized it at one point because the conversation started to shift and you could see he was typing for a while but then he stopped and didn’t post anything
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah like Hal obviously saw the Instagram post to have joined the Harry Potter conversation
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I was reading the backlog like _are you trying to one up someone you don’t even know_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yes 😂
