Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im in pain
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "There's a multiverse?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~waits for Spider-Ham to show up~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): please
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): still voiced by John Mulaney
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I'm curious if MJ actually knows he's Spiderman or if she's doing that thing where she's like "Nah I'm just fucking around with you"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i hope she knows
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same honestly
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because peter is REALLY bad at hiding it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and she's a smart gorl
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i want her to be like "you... literally have the spidersuit in your bad right now"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bag*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh Spiderman just *happened* to be in DC at the saem time as them and just *happened* to be in London at the same time as them as well
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ü§î
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "WHAT? NO I DONT!"
"the mask is right there hanging out of the zipper...."
"SHIT."
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): weirdddddddddddddd
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): spooky
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's also interesting that there's finally a Spiderman movie where Aunt May knows too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea! finally!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i like the dynamic of people knowing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but still supporting him
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think the secret identity thing kind of worked for the stand-alone films
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but in the MCU everyone knows who the Avengers are and there really aren' any secret identities
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it definitely did
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like they killed the secret identity trope in Iron Man 1
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea basically
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no one even wears masks
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and if they do its "aesthetic"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or if they do, they've been removed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and yeah for aesthetic
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): didnt spidrman have his mask removed?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or did i just imagine that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): in one of the MCU movies?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, i thought so
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think maybe in Homecoming? I think Vulture might have
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if not, you might be thinking of Spiderverse
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh.... maybe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): too many spiderman movies
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...not complaining tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): love me some spiderman
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The Toby Macguire ones used to get me so pumped up as a kid
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): GOD SAME
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd watch them and be like I WANNA FUCKING SWING FROM SHIT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): JUMP AROUND AND BOUNCE OFF THE WALLS
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my brother was green goblin one year for halloween and i wanted to be spiderman so bad but my parents wouldnt let me xD
BUT YEA SAME I WOULD DO THE HAND THWIP THING ALL THE TIME
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and like jump all over couches and like pretend i could climb walls
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it was a time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the good old days‚Ñ¢
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The Amazing Spiderman didn't have the same effect but probably because I was older. I also never saw the second one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yo listen, if spiderverse had been a thing back then with the whole "anyone can wear the mask" i wouldve tried to literally become spiderman
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): SAME
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I probably would have been an actual fucking Spiderman nerd
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I used to get some of the newer comics through a magazine drive my sister used to do in high school
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oooooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I liked the art in the one because it was very stylized. For some reason I really liked the stick thin wrist/ankle look
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there was one with Black Cat and I had a huge fucking crush on her after that one lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): black cat was so üòè üëå
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hope with them continuing the MCU, Tom Holland continues to do more. He's so young and has potential to do a lot (even though he's already been in 3 movies besides his 2 solo movies and they seem to cap the solo movies at 3 max)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but like, there's that line in the trailer where he's like "The world needs another Iron Man" and what if he takes up that leader role and assembles a new group of heroes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i will honestly cry about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats amazing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't know what other Marvel heroes they haven't touched on yet but if there's any that are similar age to Peter, it'd be neat to have like a young Avengers group

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i hope they do squirrelgirl
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): THIS WAS THE BLACK CAT ISSUE I HAD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh fuck Squirrel Girl would be awesome. I thought there was talks of that in the works
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i seriously hope so because shes a huge fucking meme and that movie would be hilarious
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Warriors_(TV_series)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is what I must have been thinking of
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "*Kate Comer as Deborah Fields / Debrii: A low-level telekinetic trickster who is a lesbian and has suffered personal loss due to the actions of other superheroes.*"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ohhhhhh shit I didnt know they were doing this
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVL_kMAu9j4
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Squirrel Girl!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"I'm into bedazzling too!"*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ahh I see Mysterio I think <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh I wonder if they are dealing black cat
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cuz I know an old comic thing was that Peter liked black cat but she always told him he was too young for her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I forget if she was supposed to be older or what in this particular iteration but I remember she flirted with him A LOT to convince him to help her steal the artifact thing and he was like, "Hey, whoa, hold up!" or something
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then ended up tricking her by giving her a decoy of the artifact and returning the real one
