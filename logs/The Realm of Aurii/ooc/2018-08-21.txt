Bill: Is Afina... trying to guilt the cardinal?
Afina (Georgia🍀): No she's more trying to act repulsed with the lack of security
Bill: ~~act?~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like "wow you let ruffians poison one of your guests"
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's the best cover story she's got ~~and the best one I could think of after trying to think of one for days~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Are you posting? owo
Bill: tis monday.
Afina (Georgia🍀): HOORAY
Afina (Georgia🍀): what do I do with dice
Afina (Georgia🍀): Do I roll for a verbal smack down of Morras
Bill: The backing behind it is it pretty weak, but go for it.
Eliran (Halim): Do I need to roll to not get hurt
Eliran (Halim): With my fall
Bill: no.
Eliran (Halim): Is Morris not getting dice
Eliran (Halim): Or do we not get to know how many dice he gets till after
Bill: I'm still writing Desii, Enera, and Morras.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOOOOO POST DAY
Afina (Georgia🍀): then I can spend my 12 hour shift tomorrow thinking of a post
Bill: I'm thinking this could be a good chance for the fight to turn into an escape next round.
Bill: ~~why does Desii keep doing quick actions, she's shit at that~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): For Afina and Elfriede cause everyone else rolled out?
Bill: Generally.
Bill: So Marisa and and Hal, do dice. Tomorrow the discussion can go out about using Enera's flashbang as a way to escape.
Nokri (Marisa): wait so did aldus catch them both? ~~did he just catch enera and let nokri fall that sounds more plausible~~
Bill: I assumed he got both of you.
Nokri (Marisa): enera flips out of his arms and nokri just chills there like "hey."
Bill: "woof"
Bill: ~~"Yiff"~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~2 dice nokri quick pickup lines~~
Elfriede (Tom): ^^^^ 🙌
Nokri (Marisa): aldus better watch out she still has a dress full of glass oops
Afina (Georgia🍀): Really Afina and Elfriede could realistically run out of the room now
Afina (Georgia🍀): They also haven't spoken about the earlier incident 👀👀👀😏😏😏
Elfriede (Tom): Are we still running with the "you can't run from encounters " thing?
Elfriede (Tom): Like you need to "defeat the threat"
Elfriede (Tom): Even if it's by running
