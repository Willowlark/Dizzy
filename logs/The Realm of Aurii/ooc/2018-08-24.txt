Afina (Georgia🍀): Is earliest than 9 or later than 9 better?
Aldus (Jess): Earlier 😬 like before 5 😬😬
Aldus (Jess): But that's mad early for Mawisa
Nokri (Marisa): This weekend is when I’ll be working a ton and I only get 2 ten minute breaks in 12 hours so I don’t think I’ll be able to 😭 
I could do it on the train, but that’s probably bad times for y’all and only gives us about 45 assuming it’s not too crowded on the train and I can use my phone
Nokri (Marisa): Today for y’all is currently Thursday right
Aldus (Jess): Yea
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee
Nokri (Marisa): 9pm Friday would be 10am Saturday for me so ye id be at work ;~;
Bill: We can either space it out over the weekend with people chiming in sporadically, or push into next week.
Nokri (Marisa): Saturday and Sunday I’ll be leaving for work at 7:30am and getting home around 10:30pm  whence I’ll probably immediately pass out so I can wake up the next day. You can have the aside without Nokri and I’ll try to chime in whenever possible, but during my breaks I’ll be eating so anything written would be really brief. I have a lot more time after the weekend but I don’t want to delay post day
Afina (Georgia🍀): There's always other things to aside to delay that one
Aldus (Jess): Nah don't worry about that that's a crazy schedule
Nokri (Marisa): but aurii
