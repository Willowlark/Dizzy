Afina (Georgia🍀): I did 2/7 questions on my midterm, time to take a break dicking around and write my post muahaha
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!301927856240459777> is a nokri and Afina aside possible? I feel like nokri is the only person Afina hasn't asides with
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause afina's gonna excuse herself from the cardinals office and take the walk of shame back to Aldus and Desii
Afina (Georgia🍀): So she can walk back with nokri and them be all "you brought HER?"
Bill: Are you still traveling?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Til 1 am 😅
Bill: Ripperoni.
Nokri (Marisa): Ye is possible! I haven’t had time to post in a while but give me like 5 minutes and I can aside and make a post that fits leading up to the aside
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I'll write afina's post now
Afina (Georgia🍀): One can just find the other walking around and Afina can invite nokri to join Aldus and Desii
Afina (Georgia🍀): And they can have their secret Enera meeting
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow Afina hadn't talked to Elfriede in like 10 years RIP
Nokri (Marisa): *the ship is crumbling someone save it*
Aldus (Jess): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus (Jess): *I have to catch up on posts oops*
Nokri (Marisa): Aurii but it’s narrated by Morgan freeman
Nokri (Marisa): i am aside-able whenever ready capitan
Afina (Georgia🍀): AYE AYE I have posted as well, can you make the little block thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): That says the location and characters
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ill just have Afina leaving the monastery and nokri spot her and be like owo?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus and Desii are assumingly in the park
Aldus (Jess): Ye
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~playing fetch or somethin lmao~~
Nokri (Marisa): wait what table is nokri even on i was getting caught up and looking around and it's not there. did it get deleted.

Afina (Georgia🍀): Use aside 1
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokris gonna be bumped to table 1 when afina's like "let's bring this little orphan that loves me to the secret kidnapping meetjng"
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think she was originally on table 2
Nokri (Marisa): o that just ended ok
but there was originally a "here's the market place" post in table 4 i think that's gone now
okie dokie artichokey
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or wait no table 4
Nokri (Marisa): ye nokri is dead now <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHOA rip
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah ok so when Afina gets to the park then Afina, Aldus, nokri, and Desii will be table 1
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Eliran and Elfriede will be table 2
Afina (Georgia🍀): So for now aside in table 1

Afina (Georgia🍀): O thank you for buying a ticket to watch aside 1
Afina (Georgia🍀): We're about to see nokri be as nice as she's ever been all game
Afina (Georgia🍀): Taking bets on how long this will last, 5 minutes or 10 years, no in between
Nokri (Marisa): i could abide by the proper laws governing royal titles and keep using "your royal highness"
or i could break those rules and just have nokri call her a different majestic title every time. decisions decisions.
Eliran (Halim): what is the description of Enera's appearance again
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri be like: omg the princess is blushing does she have a crush on me
Afina (Georgia🍀): So after this aside I'll post like a mini post in table 1 of Afina walking up with nokri
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Marisa can do the same
Nokri (Marisa): aside 1 turns into that "Would I!" "Would you?" scene from chowder
Afina (Georgia🍀): So bill and Jess have time to post before 5 as just a smol thing before they have THE GRAND MEETING
Afina (Georgia🍀): omg
Afina (Georgia🍀): Though I guess Eliran and Elfriede should also be involved?
Afina (Georgia🍀): All 6 have a meeting and Afina just makes really strong eye contact with Elfriede the whole time
Afina (Georgia🍀): _look at me you dumb beautiful ~~not lego~~ man_
Eliran (Halim): Eliran and Elfriede haven't gotten drunk yet
Aldus (Jess): ~~im not caught up on anything and I have no idea what's happening~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aside 2: Elfriede just goes "... afina?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran flips the damn table
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: Yes Elfriede the Tyndalls kidnapped Afina at a young age
Afina (Georgia🍀): Uhhh Afina asked the Cardinal about Enera, he was really shifty, and Eliran and Elfriede are having a ~~really sexually tense~~ talk about Afina and Enera
Afina (Georgia🍀): And now Afina is coming to deliver her findings to Aldus and Desii
Eliran (Halim): And I'm here to bring her home to her bumpkin inn owning parents
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg
Afina (Georgia🍀): "I'm bringing PRINCESS Tyndall to her INN OWNING parents in a DIFFERENT nAtIoN"
Aldus (Jess): Hmmm ok, not so sure there's anything for me to make a post about then 😅
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh I mean I can do it now but afina's gonna walk up with nokri
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Aldus could be like WHY DID YOU BRING THAT
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll pop it in right now actually ye

Eliran (Halim): they're at the inn
Afina (Georgia🍀): Okay so they're gonna have their sausage party
Eliran (Halim): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): I mean they got a a little more firendly with each other the night before so I don't think that would be his reaction anymore?
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): He might wonder how they met but they're "ok" for joe
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll bump it to table 1 then, I'll pop something in so we can set out the GRAND DISCUSSION™ of Enera

Nokri (Marisa): WOULD YOU?
Elfriede (Tom): WOULD I?
Nokri (Marisa): WOULD YOU?
Elfriede (Tom): ........
Elfriede (Tom): WOULD I?
Eliran (Halim): WOULD DONKEY
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm so glad I come back to ooc to find this garbage
Afina (Georgia🍀): remember the episode where they ran out of funding so they just have the voice actors saying lines

Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina thinks Nokri is nothing but nice
Afina (Georgia🍀): What a kind little Drecan

Nokri (Marisa): "now the animators are gonna have to draw all these flames"
Nokri (Marisa): nokri's been like this all along she's an angel 👼
Afina (Georgia🍀): Table 1 just couldn't see her kind heart 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina be like "Elfriede look at this kind child we can adopt"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede just punts nokri
Elfriede (Tom): OH and they go wash cars for money right?
Elfriede (Tom): good stuff 👌
Elfriede (Tom): that show came right after the misadventures of flapjack
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH FLAPJACK
Afina (Georgia🍀): I loved bubby the whale
Aldus (Jess): Yea couldn't see her "kind heart"cuz they don't got money and status
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokris waiting in the wings for daddy Aldus don't worry
Aldus (Jess): 😱
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina had to show more cultural discrepancies between Laera and other places, she gotta kiss more foreheads
Eliran (Halim): guys imagine if Eliran was like "hi I'm rich" just before they left to find desi
Eliran (Halim): how different that trip would be
Aldus (Jess): Things would have been so much easier
Eliran (Halim): Nokri wouldn't have tried to ditch them and trick desii
Eliran (Halim): probably wouldn't have been kidnapped either
Aldus (Jess): Nope
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cray but then she wouldn't have had this wonderous character development
Afina (Georgia🍀): "I'll keep this between us" <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Eliran (Halim): Eliran as Elfriede walks out: "Ok so if anyone asks what we were doing"
Eliran (Halim): "We fucked"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri the fly on the wall finds out, tells Afina, Afina just dies
Eliran (Halim): "Trust me for some reason everyone just accepts that as an excuse/alibi when it comes to me doing anything"
Nokri (Marisa): nokri and aldus just nod like "oh yeah. again."
afina just loses it
Eliran (Halim): "My companions thought I slept our way into hotels, caravans and inns our entire way to trisp"
Eliran (Halim): "I think they believe thats how I got us across the border too"
Aldus (Jess): Now that's character development <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Marisa you can have nokri respond with whatever she wanna say and then we can wrap it off with Afina being some mushy "I'm looking forward to speaking with you soon"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Could kiss her forehead too, but that might be pre-mature 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): Glad I'm finally using all that damn LAERAN LORE tho
Nokri (Marisa): yee i was just wondering if we should wrap up
we can sing the winter wrap up song but instead it's aside wrap up
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede: ~~bruh you wanna look for Afina with me, are you tryna WATCH or something~~
Eliran (Halim): HAHAHAHA
Eliran (Halim): NOKRI
Eliran (Halim): INTERESTED IN _ELIRAN_
