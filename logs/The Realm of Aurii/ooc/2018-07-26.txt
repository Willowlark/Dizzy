"*Harder Afina*"
"What."
"What."
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina (Georgia🍀): eliran is torn between smacking him again and not
Eliran (Halim): Eliran leaves and brings afina  in

Nokri (Marisa): new react when
Elfriede (Tom): Soooo good
Afina (Georgia🍀): i found an arkos blog and they had that
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i was like wow thats topical
Dizzy: GM posts come out today.
Bill: Tom has a book to write and we’re in need of some asiding tho.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah
Aldus (Jess): i should be around for aside all day pretty much unless i go to gym later
Aldus (Jess): ~~would strongly prefer before 5 though~~
Bill: Same.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm in a backroom all day today so I can respond to tom more likely than not lol
Elfriede (Tom): Will try my best to write something at work
Elfriede (Tom): I gotta to the base post so asiding can happen
Elfriede (Tom): Wrote an outline for my post just need to type it up
Elfriede (Tom): If anyone needs me to change anything just let me know
Elfriede (Tom): It's kinda a polarizing post
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg discord finally loaded
Afina (Georgia🍀): For some reason my discord crapped out and I was like "phone, this is LITERALLY  one of the biggest events in play by post HISTORY"
Bill: Tom only posted outside the door tho.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I didnt know how far he was gonna wriiiite
Afina (Georgia🍀): I had to stay vigilant
Afina (Georgia🍀): And phone was not allowing such a case
Elfriede (Tom): Yeeet, I figured anything inside should be together and or aside
Bill: I doubt I'm going to continue myself though.
Bill: Continuing would just leave Afina KO'd and that's not the goal.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean you could let Afina have a win and break his finger
Afina (Georgia🍀): _but afrin is not allowed any victory, no matter how small, ***suffer***_
Bill: You can do that yourself.
Bill: Ya'll have the creative freedom at this point.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ah okay
Afina (Georgia🍀): Is the legos happening in an aside or a couple posts back and forth
Bill: I'd prefer in post.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aight so elfriede is bumped to table 1
Afina (Georgia🍀): I can re-post a bit more or you can keep writing tom, either way is cool with me
Elfriede (Tom): Ahh kk I wasn't sure how we we're running it
Elfriede (Tom): Are we doing what we want with the bishop then?
Aldus (Jess): kill him elfy
Elfriede (Tom): FUCK HIM UP
Bill: *Fuck Batman*
Aldus (Jess): fuck the bishop
Elfriede (Tom): Maybe do a smol post Georgia to do a small scene set I suppose
Elfriede (Tom): I'll jump over to table 1 to respond
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede (Tom): I almost wrote table 2
Aldus (Jess): matbe tom should move second part of his post to table 1?
Bill: ^
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh yeah do that
Elfriede (Tom): Mm true
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then I'll do a smol set up post
Aldus (Jess): "I can't believe this! Who is so damn foolish as to ignore me?" Mr. Elfriede, self entitled Faun at your serive"
Afina (Georgia🍀): That way the back and forth responding format is maintained
Afina (Georgia🍀): LMAO
Aldus (Jess): desire to write: 1/10
Aldus (Jess): i will attempt tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): My job today is to shred files
Afina (Georgia🍀): /sits on a pile of files to write post
Aldus (Jess): table 1 is too distracting 😂 can i write for table 1 instead
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus is the real lego reveal
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina is still shocked somehow lol
Aldus (Jess): i think aldus would be more shocked
Aldus (Jess): and elated
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Elfriede is magically hooman and everyone lives happily ever after
Aldus (Jess): "uncaring if others followed"
*follows*
Elfriede (Tom): Well exactly
Elfriede (Tom): I left it open for people to follow if they wanted to
Aldus (Jess): i mean id like to but that would make no sence so
Aldus (Jess): "Oh well fuck this shit ill go follow mr grumpy"
Elfriede (Tom): I kinda like this current dynamic as a setup for the future
Elfriede (Tom): It also explains why Elfriede has no friends
Aldus (Jess): what dynamic so you mena
Elfriede (Tom): That way he HAS to make friends after him and Afina won't talk
Elfriede (Tom): Or he'll be talking to noone
Bill: Oh, I had an idea for that.
Elfriede (Tom): Ye?
Aldus (Jess): plz share
Bill: I think after everything goes down, ya'll need to be *forced* to work together. Someone/Some group will have the up on you all and you'll need to play by their rules for awhile or it'll spell trouble.
Bill: One example could be Eraia says "guess whose going on quest X cause they murdered a Bishop? That's right, all of you assholes".
Bill: That is not the one I'm leaning towards, but examples are examples.
Bill: one, it'll keep the bickering duo together, and two, it'll provide you all with an immediate direction to wander in.
Aldus (Jess): wander in?
Bill: Get us out of home base mode and more questing.
Aldus (Jess): id like to have more of an idea where things are going if possible. it would help me plan and write better
Aldus (Jess): but i understand wanting to keep it more reaction besed
Bill: Oh yeah, I’m just waiting till we get into the thick of the climax we’re setting up. You’ll know what the plan is (and give me input on it) before leaving Trisp.
Aldus (Jess): mmkay
Bill: I’ll get to the aside shortly.
Aldus (Jess): it would also help me maybe think of ways to get my character more involved and be more emotionally invested int he story
Eliran (Halim): Elfriedes with everyone right
Eliran (Halim): Cause rliran needs to have a worry wart moment with elfriede at some point in this aiding
Eliran (Halim): God darn your post took him away before eliran could worry wart
Aldus (Jess): yea elfriede was like "fuck you guys, bye"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "My pseudo girlfriend may or may not be getting ganked right now, brb"
Bill: Hal, is Eliran on his knee over by the door or did he step across the room?
Eliran (Halim): are they all still outside or did Enera let them in
Bill: The door is open and Enera is on the other side of the room. Desii just stepped in enough to push the door open.
Eliran (Halim): so nobody is already in the room ?
Eliran (Halim): except desi slightly and enera
Bill: mhmm.
Eliran (Halim): hmmmm
Eliran (Halim): gimme a half sec gonna edit it
Elfriede (Tom): Can the bishop fight?
Elfriede (Tom): He can cast magic right?
Bill: yeah.
Bill: He's a skilled light mage.
Elfriede (Tom): Kk
Afina (Georgia🍀): Pfft light mage who even does that
Afina (Georgia🍀): He's got no tomes on him right now tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just a cloth lol
Bill: correct.
Bill: There's tomes in the room, but I kinda figured Elfie would get the 2x Sneak Attack Bonus.
Eliran (Halim): lol cause bashing a door in is a sneak attack
Bill: The guy is a little preoccupied.
Eliran (Halim): Side note, what if everybody is forced to work together
Eliran (Halim): because eraia is hunting a band of people who killed a bishop
Afina (Georgia🍀): Well Elfriede is an Eraian knight of a positively reputationed military family
Bill: That's one of many options.
Afina (Georgia🍀): If he blames the killing on someone else, they'll probably take his word, won't they?
Eliran (Halim): Nonono
Eliran (Halim): Elfriede uses chasing Eliran and crew as a reason to flee the country
Eliran (Halim): "yeah totally gonna hunt them down i got you"
Eliran (Halim): "100% not gonna just go MIA after hopping the border cause they maybe 'killed' me too"
Eliran (Halim): boom story done
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like Elfriede blames Eliran and co ?
Eliran (Halim): what are the parent's names and the inn name again
Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/12/15/NPCs.html#dain-kelit
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOP Enera was kidnapped 4 years ago
Afina (Georgia🍀): Enera of eraia says she's only been there 2 years
Afina (Georgia🍀): _not good_
Eliran (Halim): question is that a typo
Afina (Georgia🍀): _unelss that was an actual typi_
Bill: ~~she said 4 years what are you talking about~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): The NPC thing
Bill: ~~You know what nevermind she said 2 years and the typo is the webpage~~
Aldus (Jess): have elfy disowned fromt he family and excommunicated and just entirly wreck him
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOF no family, no military, ~~tfw~~ no gf
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ouchie elfie
Aldus (Jess): damn i gotta find a way to wreck aldus
Bill: ~~Did someone ask for their Daddy~~
Aldus (Jess): aldus is gonna get a rich boyfriend?!
Bill: Or an abusive father.
Eliran (Halim): I mean Eliran is right there to stand in for one of those things
Eliran (Halim): ~~plot twist Eliran is Aldus's abusive father~~
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Eliran (Halim): ~~in _disguise_~~
Aldus (Jess): that would be terrible!
Aldus (Jess): also wtf awkward
Eliran (Halim): "Hi son i followed you here cause I wanted to see if an adventure could finally make you transform when you're in danger"
Eliran (Halim): "But nope, your still a punk ass bitch
Aldus (Jess): "meanwhile that other kid just transformed like a boss but hes all pised about it, im gonna kick both your asses"
Eliran (Halim): btw jess you wanna respond first or should i
Eliran (Halim): to enera
Aldus (Jess): her wording is confusing me a bit but ill respond  first
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldo should mention that he's from Wynne
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wynne and Callora be like 🤞
Eliran (Halim): no he shouldn't
Aldus (Jess): he allready did silly
Aldus (Jess): wait to afina? or to enera?
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOP gomen I am reading the posts between shredding papers I thought I didn't see it
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean both now that you mention it 🤔
Eliran (Halim): he shouldn't tell enera
Aldus (Jess): well him and afina talked breifly about it
Aldus (Jess): in the park
Aldus (Jess): it was like the one 10 second conversation they had
Bill: I'm making up cards like I have for Desii for the other characters.
Bill: `Charismatic but Self Deprecating (Fake it till you make you it. All his bragging would make you think Aldus is quite in love with himself, he’s highly convincing) ` <-- This is Aldo?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof we need an Afina and Aldus aside, stat
Aldus (Jess): it was supposed to be
Aldus (Jess): but that was like a year ago now
Afina (Georgia🍀): _omg a whole year crazy_
Bill: goes to show how characters evolve.
Aldus (Jess): i cant think of anything to replace it
Aldus (Jess): ive tried before
Aldus (Jess): he was originally supposed to be charismatic
Aldus (Jess): kind of braggy but is actually insecure

Aldus (Jess): like the one with her parents?
Bill: yup.
Aldus (Jess): ~~im confused as to why eli is mad at aldi~~
Eliran (Halim): he isn't
Aldus (Jess): OH i read it wrong
Aldus (Jess): i read it as "The only public knowledge on Enera claims she's an 'Eraian born Light magic', Genius"
Aldus (Jess): like as in sarcastically calling him a genius
Aldus (Jess): and i was like 🤔  😵
Bill: <@!288513265661902858> hold off
Bill: oof I'm doing the talk to myself thing it sucks.

Aldus (Jess): THEY BLEACHED HER HAIR THOSE BASTARDS
Bill: k, thanks for waiting while I talk to myself.
Aldus (Jess): also which of katys trait are you referring too?
Bill: Katy is blonde. the rest of us have brown hair.
Aldus (Jess): ooo your dad has grey hair now though doesnt he?
Bill: Pretty much.
Aldus (Jess): ye
Elfriede (Tom): Omg I love that Eliran said crisscrossapplesauce
Elfriede (Tom): That'd too good
Elfriede (Tom): 😂

Eliran (Halim): Eliran proceeds to make the largest and longest eyeroll in Aurii history
Bill: `You must have memories of them, surley 11 is an age old enough to remember quite a bit?"` <-- ...*you trying to poke holes in my plot*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri bangs pots and pans in the aside, chanting "eraia is full of liars"
Bill: well crap now I have to write a post for the head-table.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Table 1: wow guys look we accomplished our objective! Good teamwork! Let's take Enera home!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Table 2: everything is on fire, Afina is dead, Laera is invading, Elfie has his tail hanging out his pants, no one is okay, everyone is crying
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Aldus (Jess): Honestly thought eraia brainwashed her
Bill: Mental magic is too powerful for the game world.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> 😏
Aldus (Jess): Well I was thinking like potions or conditioning or some shit idk
Aldus (Jess): That was my suspicion
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh what
Afina (Georgia🍀): Was Afina trying to do that?
Afina (Georgia🍀): That would be rad
Afina (Georgia🍀): That wasn't what I was trying to put with the last post tho lol
Bill: different smirk.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not picking up what you're throwing down
Bill: you~will~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ARE YOU SAYING AFINA SHOULD DO MENTAL MAGIC
Afina (Georgia🍀): time to overanalyze the shit outta that phrase
Bill: *no*.
Bill: Mental magic is not happening.
Bill: Like, ever. It's gimmick and makes for shitty plots (cough cough Chat Noir has been brainwashed yet again).
Afina (Georgia🍀): Billiam I'm stoopid what do yoU MEAN
Bill: not stupid, but you do *suck* at picking up subtleties.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I do this is true
Aldus (Jess): *nice*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Divulge to me the truths billiam
Bill: you'll see. Have some faith.
Bill: Heh.
Aldus (Jess): I'm so confused
Aldus (Jess): Did Georgia say she wanted to use mental magic at some point?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ME FUCKIN TOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): I said I wanted glowy eyes and I was denied
Bill: you're focusing on the wrong thing, first of all.
Aldus (Jess): Oh was that a response to table-1 vs table-2 thingy?
Aldus (Jess): Look we all need to go down to this room so Aldus's can laugh at Elfriedes weird earless wolf form
Aldus (Jess): But then also be jealous
Afina (Georgia🍀): "HAH YOU DONT EVEN HAVE EARS"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede, covered in blood, straight faced: "you don't even have a wolf form."
Aldus (Jess): Elfriede doesn't know that about Aldus thoigh
Aldus (Jess): Nither do Afina
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill said mental magic is too powerful for the GAME WORLD, DOES THAT MEAN PLAY BY POST IS REAL
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill did you make me my very own Afina
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sitting in your basement like a mad scientist
Afina (Georgia🍀): Discovering the secret of making a human person
Bill: Mental Magic in the real world is bad news bears.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill is making play by post real I can't believe t
Aldus (Jess): Elfriede hasn't even talked to Aldi he know nothin

Bill: 😏
Aldus (Jess): ~~table 1 been freely narating combat all afternoon~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): BILLIAM SECRETS SECRETS ARE NO FUN UNLESS YOU SHARE WITH EVERYONE
Bill: reference.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aye aye aye all these religious guys and their obsession with lylalel reincarnations
Bill: *a year in the making*
Bill: *The Enera secret revealed*
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah afinas next post will be complicated
Bill: Also secrets are *very* fun when I can tease people over them.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Is the secret that eraians are evil
Bill: For example.
Bill: :3
Bill: No, the secret is as revealed.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WAIT DID HE HAVE A TOMES
Bill: ?
Aldus (Jess): Secret?
Aldus (Jess): Eraias full of pedophiles?
Afina (Georgia🍀): DID HE DO THAT MENTALLY
Bill: *That Enera is suspected as Lylalel incarnate*
Bill: Georgia ffs, there’s no mental magic.
Bill: At all.
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!351785752197201920> for the good of the post, this is gonna be sorta short, but I think it's cause Elfriede has to turn to acknowledge Afina, maybe, idk
Afina (Georgia🍀): O H
Aldus (Jess): You already basically said that thoigh
Afina (Georgia🍀): Torino said the same thing about Afina tho so all these guys just creepy
Bill: I did *now*
Aldus (Jess): Yea cuz timin was like "moras thinks he's got lylalala but I do!"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omfg
Afina (Georgia🍀): "You hear that Morras, I got LOLOLOL!"
Bill: Torin was jealous of Raive.  Him trying to take Afina was a way to prove himself better than Raive.
Afina (Georgia🍀): He said Afrin was lalala too tho so these crazy men's don't know what they're doin
Afina (Georgia🍀): Petition for someone's character to actually say lalala
Aldus (Jess): They wanna creep on young girls is what they doin
Aldus (Jess): Aldi's gonna do it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof
Afina (Georgia🍀): Thank u aldo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Taking one for the team
Aldus (Jess): This religious shit is confusing
Bill: Torin only got added in because lego reveal.
Bill: Morras is the only “this girl is Lylalel” that was out there originally.
Aldus (Jess): So Enera is fighting with the pedo? Against us?
Bill: Ye she with you.
Bill: ~~at least fein excitement this actually was one of the original storylines finally coming to a close~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): But we know she's not lololol
Afina (Georgia🍀): Right?
Bill: Morras thinks she is.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Did elfie totally rip his clothes like the hulk when he went wolf
Afina (Georgia🍀): Imma assume no
