Nokri (Marisa): thinking of starting up a new quest tonight to distract from the scary sirens and quacking and clouds outside
B was the most popular option, followed by a tie between A and C, so I'll start a quest around B?
but that begs the question, since this takes place in an early alternate America........................

Should Jim Crow laws exist in this alternate world? They didn't in Amelia's setting, but this character has dark skin and lives in the south whereas Amelia was light skinned and around Minnesota. I don't want the story to center around racism (~~that was A's plot~~) but i don't want to pull a white privilege card and make a fantasy story where Jim Crow didn't exist without first acknowledging how real it was and how long those laws lasted. 

if it's in the story, i'll try to write it as realistically as my knowledge allows without allowing it to take over and become the focus of the story. if it's not in the story, i'll find a way to retcon equality in the US. probably about how the war ruined any record-keeping system and how the government can't exactly regulate anything anymore, and white people frequently have their skin darkened by nature magic so it's much less frequent to judge people based on skin color? <:thinku:543194478614413318> 

whaddya think, racism or naw?
Nokri (Marisa): wow that sounds awful
Nokri (Marisa): for reference, this would take place in the early 1900s-1910s, mmmmmmmmaybe 1920s, during the "separate but equal" era and the second (and arguably biggest? not sure) wave of the KKK. segregation wasn't illegal until 1964. military was unsegregated in 48,  MLK's I Have A Dream speech was in 63, Brown v. the board of education was 54 but some trials around segregation in schools continued until 72, Ruby Bridges and the Little Rock Nine were 60 and 57 respectively, and civil rights continue to be an issue today but i'd say for arguments' sake it continued to be a major issue in the south/midwest until the 80s/90s.
