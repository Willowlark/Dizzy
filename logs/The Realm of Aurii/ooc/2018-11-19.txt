No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Aight since everyone wants to leave camp ASAP, lets discuss here *how* they should leave.

Amelia and Judas were following the river to the city.
It is currently night time and incredibly difficult to see. By following the sounds of the river they can keep going on their path. But if they get too close to the river they will be attacked again.
The griffon is unharmed, but will be very tired once its adrenaline wears off and will be unable to defend Amelia and Judas from further attacks.
They still have their campfire and Judas's lighter.

They can wander through the forest and risk getting lost, follow the river and risk getting attacked, try to navigate through the forest by following the river from afar, or anything else you can think of.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah prob the river from.afar deal
