El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yo I built Elfriede as a Dex Rapier Fighter in DND and I love him
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That +9 to hit is the good 🙏
Bill: At 7 in the morning?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nah did it yesterday but I just remembered
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jeez what level is he
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Only 5
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :3c
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I took duelist (cuz ofc) which gives him +2 to hit with any 1 handed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): +4 from dex and +3 from proficiency
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought proficiency came from your dex modifier 🤔
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could be wrong
Bill: Proficiency is a bonus that scales with level (+2 till level.4) that’s added to any skill you have proficiency in, or when using any weapon/tool that you have it with.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then I'm thinking of attack bonus
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Initiative maybe Erik?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Cuz that comes from dex
Bill: Nope. Proficiency is added to to hit. Proficiency is not added to damage rolls.
Bill: Init is literally just your Dex mod.
