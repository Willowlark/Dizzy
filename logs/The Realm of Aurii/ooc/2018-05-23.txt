Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YEAH besides like when he was a kid

Afina (Georgia🍀): thats too real omg
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~FINE FUCK IT they boned off screen, rewrite the whole thing~~

Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): god elfriede and afina have such tension i just want to kick them both
Eliran (Halim): Aldus like Eliran gonna think I'm crazy
Aldus (Jess): god elfriede and afina have so much tension i wanna write smutty fanfiction
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Eliran (Halim): For trying to save this person so hard and thinking she might have a good si
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~2 types of people~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah eliran and aldus should talk about that at some point hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Eliran (Halim): Eliran over here like "Fucking killed dem banditos and saved a smol ~~bitch of a~~ girl. Good day today"
Eliran (Halim): Eliran would probably be shocked that Aldus thinks he'd call him crazy for wanting to save Nokri and thinking she might have a soft side
Afina (Georgia🍀): killed bandits, check. saved bitch, check. ~~made a pass at aldus, not check.~~ its been a good day, eliran.
Eliran (Halim): Yep
Eliran (Halim): That's Eliran in a nutshell
Aldus (Jess): its more for the thinking she has a good side than the saving part
Eliran (Halim): Yeah I'd still say Eliran would be shocked
Aldus (Jess): and also becuase aldus is overthinking and being self conscious
Bill: ```He felt Afina stiffen a bit ``` and because of you knuckleheads that ended up being really weird to read.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _theres no way that could be interpretted weirdly_
Aldus (Jess): FINA GOT A SECRET TOOOOOO
Eliran (Halim): Lol I'm sure 
I was more mentioning it cause 
Eliran isn't gonna bring the topic up tho cause he doesn't see it as an issue at all
Eliran (Halim): Like if Aldus comes up to him later he'll be like "OK...?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): aldus gotta come up like "can we bro talk, bro"
Eliran (Halim): Eliran be like "yeah bro let's bow bro talk bro
Aldus (Jess): ye but Aldus doesnt think they are close enough for him to just spill that. it would have to start more gradule
Aldus (Jess): like eliran being like "wow bro you totally charged in there" or smth
Aldus (Jess): or "whoa are you ok you just stormed off"
Afina (Georgia🍀): so eliran has to pursue the truth on what aldus is feelin
Aldus (Jess): Aldus is probably going to be p. quiet and acting kinda weird for the rest of the night so we could do an aside as long as it doesn't go past like 11pm
Eliran (Halim): I just read the post 
Eliran will probs approach him after return I guess
Aldus (Jess): If we have time its cool 👌 I guess it could go past post day too it would just be like "backdated"
Afina (Georgia🍀): only when i copy and paste from google docs to chat client do i realize how much i typed hooooly fuck
Aldus (Jess): Did Afina just ask elfriede to be her bae?
Afina (Georgia🍀): NAH she asked if sleeping next to each other is gonna be normal for them
Afina (Georgia🍀): and holding hands too i guess
Afina (Georgia🍀): _she was ambiguous on purpose cause she dunno what elfies thinkin_
Aldus (Jess): ~~so yes?~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): _afina just asked for cuddles ~~for now~~_
Aldus (Jess): So yes
Afina (Georgia🍀): i meannn subliminally
Afina (Georgia🍀): sortaaaa
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ye good POST babe
Aldus (Jess): Tank
