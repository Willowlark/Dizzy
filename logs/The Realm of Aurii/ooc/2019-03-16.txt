NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): OH YEAH SO
if anyone is interested in the quest
i summarized it when they joined and were getting bombarded with 500 new pieces of information per second, i can post that again if you guys are interested and wanna read it
basically you just read the post that's posted and vote on what action you want to take next. You vote for *one action* (<:lenny:395307171539189760>) and the action with the most votes is what happens next. if there's a tie I'll try and mediate between the two actions, but this time there's a tie on two totally opposite options so someone pls break the tie
