Aldus Larian (Jess): oo nvm i had to read again
Bill: Meta info, you only get controlled by mist of you get completely consumed in the heavy fog sections of the mist, or a clouded pins you down and basically breathes mist down your throat.
Bill: The mist is where the Mist has power, the fog is where it converts peeps.
Aldus Larian (Jess): can we hear Mc Douche's villian monologue? or can only afina hear him?
Bill: He’s not shouting it or anything, but if you happen to be nearby or listening with 4 ears...
Aldus Larian (Jess): also what do kieron look like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He tol, brown hair, green eyes
Aldus Larian (Jess): thank!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Color coordinated with Afina in Laeran blue military gear
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Next aurii post: everyone just kicking Kieron while he’s down
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GOOD POST
Aldus Larian (Jess): THANK
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Red Cross Aldus to the rescue
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll post something something when I get back
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i have no idea if that's gonna help at all but i thought it was clever at least
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If anything it gives more aldus characterization very well
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🎉
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh baby guess who can add to her Afina playlist now that new events are unfolding
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my playlist would currently just have two songs: "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor and "Roar" by Katy Perry lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GOOD START
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O ya Erik let’s coordinate our posts tomorrow if Afina and chengu are gonna team up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah!
Bill: Should say, my thought with the coming scene is more about getting key people (San, Afina parents) out of the room rather than massive clusterfuck battle. Papa Tyndall can also exposition a bit. Y’all can do whatever you want of course, just telling you my initial image.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The way things are right now, seems like Aldus and Elfriede could be helping lead people in an evacuation effort while Chengu and Afina try to get Kieron to call off the mist?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Does he even have the authority for that?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): They dont
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That exactly what they gonna do anyways
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Elfriede is at least getting the Queen and san out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's what I was figuring
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Are Afina and chengu just gonna beat up on Kieron until he admits he can’t stop THE MIST
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~they *could*~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Right now I feel like Chengu would have followed after Kieron and Afina and when he gets up to the balcony, he just sees the mist and pandemonium in the ballroom below and Afina standing over Kieron who's on his knees and Chengu is just like "holy shit what the fuck"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _why did I come to callora_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hah I just realized Afina doesn’t even know his name yet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okay so what do they do after Kieron’s on his knees
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is Afina like YOU THERE help me beat up this man
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or do they abandon Kieron to get away and start rescue efforts?
Bill: I think, at least at this point in time, Kieron should be capable enough that fighting him is difficult/would take time you don't have.
Bill: You know, midboss type.
Aldus Larian (Jess): are we running again?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think we gotta evac the room and then The Squad will all see each other
Bill: Mm, then you can yeet from the castle, find Kieron's "friends", fight a smaller group of baddies in a hallway (my suggestion to not fight in the ballroom is just due to how LARGE that room is and how many people are present), see if anyone from the Castle knows about what's happening...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How fight tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like who’s got fighting capability
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _who brought a knife to the party, fess up_
Bill: if you need weapons maybe you can go find yours.
Bill: Or raid a guard station.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /recalls locker to fly through the air and delivery weapons
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Elfriede brought his but their with his stuff
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Prob in his qiarters
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I also think Kieron should be a little less crazy power hungry, a little more dumb ambitious
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But he probably has dark tomes on him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or a KNIFE
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Watcha got there Kieron
Bill: Yeah, he's ambitious.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _thats it, thats all chengu says_
Bill: He thinks he's using these 'friends' of his, but they're using him.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I feel at this point in the dialogue he’s probably like wtf Afina I thought this was what you wanted
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And less _how dare you betray me woman_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bill:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also Bill:
Bill: Correct...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If it takes time we don’t have, ABSCOND WOO
Bill: It's more about not eliminating him immediately.
Bill: He's more useful defeated later, after he reveals the identity of his 'friends' in a showy gesture.
Bill: Nor do we want him to come off *completely* incapable by getting scrubbed immediately.
Bill: So it'd be better for him to have the upper hand now, and lose later.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so you mean he gets away now?
Bill: I'd say so.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So no fighty?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Chengu probs has no weapons since he was a slave. He couuld either nab like, a steak knife from a nearby table on his way up or we somehow raid an armory on the way out
Bill: You can fight him, just don't *kill him* immediately.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina probably sees chengu comin up the stairs, gets distracted, Kieron gets away
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like that?
Bill: fight him enough to get distance from him, then prioritize getting your Father to safety or something.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Writes: suddenly zues himself sends a bolt down and instantly fries Kieron
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tfw you’re such a douche that a god himself smites you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean the dude is in a kneel so
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He probably didn’t plan Afina to put up a fight
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nokri suddenly falls from the rafter (as she was following afina the entire time) and shanks him
Bill: nah, he's an idiot who thinks this was a *good* idea.
Bill: Afina could easily take him with a tome, but rather than killing him off in his first scene I just think it'd be better if he gets away to cause more chaos before you axe him.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Elfriede shows up to kill him and despite his skill, Elfriede is instead the one who gets stabbed, as per usual
Bill: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Elfriede goes into a bar, "I'll have the usual"
Bartender gives him two ciders and stabs him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Chengu bursts onto the balcony, Afina turns to see him, as her back is turned Kieron leaps off the balcony and does some sort of mage-y featherfall type move and yeets outta there as the fog starts making its way up to the balcony where Afina and Chengu are
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Keiron uses pocket sand
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought there was a second floor exit that they were near to begin with
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LMAO
Bill: Georgia correct.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So Kieron yeets through there and Afinas like UGH NOT WORTH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that too, but less dramatic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t think there’s a magic to slow falling 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Now that I think about it
Bill: Could still have a little face off. Or an epic slap to the face where Afina makes it very obvious she was only following his orders for show.
Bill: Technically? It's supposed to be Light, Anima, and Dark magic. The only kinds of magic castable without an hours long ritual is battle magic that's been enscribed into a tome.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Or Kik in the nut
Bill: ^
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH NUT KICK
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he can’t run away then tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okay so continue from where I am, rendezvous with chengu, Kieron ollies out, Afina and him begin DA RESCUE
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I should probably have Elfriede go to go back in for Afina but then realize she's perfectly capable of saving herself and instead go get a weapon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “I have to save the prince- mmm nah you know what she’s p strong”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Plus he has to attend to _Fina’s mom_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 😱
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But also yeah he do
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And now the songs stuck in my head again lmaoo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Where’s Nokri? Capturing the mist in jars to fuck with later probably
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ya know, probably
Nokri (Marisa): I haven’t read the new posts yet aaa sorry but the toxic mist did sound really neat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It okay take your time!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I can't believe someone planted a bomb in the ballroom
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Who could have done this
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri shuffles away innocently
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i can’t believe you’ve done this_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *[insert Mystic Messenger bomb meme here]*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _she is done_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): [Insert “friendship ended with elfriede, now chengu is my friend” meme here]
Aldus Larian (Jess): can someone summerize these 78 messaged for me <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Kieron is getting away
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Everyone is escaping to the hallway to fight some goons
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m very stylish clothing, this will be very badass
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And then more plot will come when we reconvene with Father
Aldus Larian (Jess): and theres a bomb?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No bomb
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just bad gas coming from the basement
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok gotcha
Tikur (Kurtis): Is this gas flammable I wonder <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: it's magical mist rather than gas so...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bad gas is more fun to say than bad mist
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WELL it would suck if it were flammable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just implied Afinas mom is doing fire magic and her mentor is using light
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): To protect THE PEOPLE
Tikur (Kurtis): *FOR THE PEOPLE* everything explodes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooooh shiiiiit
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <@351471675843411978> I was making a mystic messenger joke
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i thought there was actually a bomb tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~who put poison in the punch?~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Assassins? In my unity party?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s more likely than you’d think
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): trying to think what to do... *dare we make a dashing escape over the banister?*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Power slide down the bannister
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like a sick grind
Tikur (Kurtis): Gotta do a 360 kickflip off that bad boy for the extra points
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, I'm trying to picture what this balcony looks like?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and the stairs that lead up to it
Tikur (Kurtis): Titanic grand stair case style?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was imagining the stairs in my house
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But stone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And there’s two of them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And they lead to a balcony that overlooks the dance floor
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea im also having a hard time visualizing. like i have my own idea but im not sure if thats what biru was going for or not
Bill: this kinda thing.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YO THATS WHAT I JUST DREW

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So like dis
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So like dis
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh I imagined that too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They similar
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no that's what it should be. I imagined something completely different
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye and then Elfie, Aldi, Nokri, Tikur are below
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is initially what I imagined the balcony to be like, a separate room
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Overlooking the ballroom, stairs accessed by a door in the ballroom
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like your way better 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): those are simular but from different perspectives
Nokri (Marisa): “Come with me to the balcony, we have to talk in private”
Stands on a very public and easily spottable place where everyone can see on top of the stairs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mine was a little more closed off and the stairs were in a stairwell outside the ballroom
Tikur (Kurtis): Chengu has a very big <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881> energy in all these magnificent drawings
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tfw some little bitch ruins a nice party:

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Hey I’m here to part- oh my this is not that”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "This is where the fun begins"
*opens door and a puff of mist rushes through, screams and chaos can be heard from inside*
*closes the door and backs away slowly*
Tikur (Kurtis): https://media.tenor.com/images/4d9ad68b2a81400686043e87089d5d1e/tenor.gif

El🆓de Faun (Tom): this will never get old btw
