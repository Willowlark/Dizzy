Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~famous last words~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *rereads aside 1* ugh Elfriede, what a buzzkill mah dude.
Aldus (Jess): What a boner killer
Nokri (Marisa): *jessica*
Nokri (Marisa): this is a nice christian server

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 🙏
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH

*Gif from flcl*
"I'm gonna make you feel all betterrrr" *chainsaw noises*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ya know that sad feeling you get after whatching a show, where your otp like... Almost gets together but doesn't.
..ooof...yeahh
Aldus (Jess): Sept this time you did it to yourself
Aldus (Jess): Kids learn from elfriede, don't keep secrets you just end up hurt in the end
Nokri (Marisa): mmmmmmmmmm whatcha saaaaaaaay
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmaoooo
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: What would we do without Marisa 🙏
Nokri (Marisa): aldus would probably be cured and no one would have any problems <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: So I did the thing where I type Elfriede and then mashed the top left button for autofill
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede hasn't had any and every day I think it's the best way.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 😭 so accurate
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri the morning is a good day to go to the beach and I have work to do so I can stay home and stay home safe
Nokri (Marisa): Nice
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nice ❤
Nokri (Marisa): wow i wonder who aldus could be talking about <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Aldus groans slightly more than a few minutes to chat with you about the position and would like to know what the hell happened
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede nodded and raised his sword and I was wondering how it works but it's just been a jerk.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I hit random options that time
Eliran (Halim): Eliran is cocky but not during the week
Eliran (Halim): Eliran said he was like a big thing and he didn't want it to be open for convos
Nokri (Marisa): i'm ironing a bunch of costumes now but if aldo wants to aside after eliran they can have an actual kokoro to kokoro (eliran can join too)
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oooo
Nokri (Marisa): where did my maid uniform go
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede will eventually need an apology aside for nokri too
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Cuz he still thinks she's really sweet <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *fornow*
Nokri (Marisa): Of course she’s sweet
Aldus (Jess): Aldus to elfriede: xoh honey you got a big storm coming"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Plus he still has those hair bands that he never gave to Afrin
Aldus (Jess): And yea we can do an aside <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Eliran (Halim): Eliran Elfriede aside when
Aldus (Jess): I don't wanna fight no more 😭
Nokri (Marisa): Peaceful aside 🙏
Aldus (Jess): I don't wanna fight with Eliran either 😭
Aldus (Jess): I'm no good at fighting ~~specially when I don't actually care about elirans title~~
Nokri (Marisa): aldus: "can i at least get ur autograph before u go to bed"
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: "No." _fuckin fanboys are the worse_
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Aldus (Jess): I don't know how to argue 😂
Aldus (Jess): I'm like "ok yea you right"
Nokri (Marisa): "no u"
Aldus (Jess): YES good
Aldus (Jess): Aldus can't fight™
Nokri (Marisa): moana soundtrack starts playing in the distance of their fight
"you know who. you. aaaaaare."
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I want an Elfriede aside with everyone eventually
Nokri (Marisa): this but elfriede
https://am22.akamaized.net/tms/cnt/uploads/2015/11/hello-zuko-here.gif
Aldus (Jess): Omggg
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina and Elfriede can be like a little bit too late for that too lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^ autofill is real
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Omg!
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elrian is cocky, but no during the week is halarious
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus and cheese is the only reason why I'm not super hot
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani 😂
Aldus (Jess): That's amazing
Aldus (Jess): Me too though
Bill: Apparently the first thing in your brain to slow down when you're tired is the creative portion.
Bill: So the lot of us tired posting is actually bad for quality.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeeeee
Bill: I believe it though.
Aldus (Jess): Oh yea def I know that from personal experience cuz of work
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Despite Elfriede's heritage I feel as though I should darken his skin tone slightly. At least a light tan. He lives pretty south and one parent is a human from Eraia. Maybe light one shade lighter or the same as Nokri
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Plus I never describe his scarring, it's not too bad because of the healers but still present.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Def one in his stomach <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~oops~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's a good point, though the fact that nokri looks so different is WHY he can profile her like he did
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like in the scene with his shirt off I should mentioned it a bit oops
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oops you still could edit it
Afina (Georgia🍀): It doesn't change the outcome of the aside lol
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Truuuuue
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hals playing the lion king soundtrack while we're driving
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: GOOD HALIM
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aside 1 in a nutshell: can you feel the love tonight but stopped halfway through
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: T.T
Afina (Georgia🍀): I want my Aurii Disney dammit
