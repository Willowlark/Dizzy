Bill: something I'm not loving about the last round; characters were fighting in the last set of posts, yet now I'm writing how they all decided to go to dinner. I don't like that shift all happening in aside. I'm not sure what the fix is yet, but it is something that bugs me.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: i dont think they were really fighting tho
Bill: you get the idea.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The dialogue is too fast paced for actual posts tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Otherwise we're here for two weeks watching Eliran and Elfriede talk
Afina (Georgia🍀): And that's boring
Bill: you are correct.
Bill: I just don't like how this reads in the tables.
Eliran (Halim): maybe have the last person in an aside do a summary post
Bill: Or do The aside first, posting after that which will cover the intro the The aside as well the finale.
Eliran (Halim): maybe
Eliran (Halim): tbh even our posts were mainly aside continuations
Eliran (Halim): which is why it probably feels wonky too
Afina (Georgia🍀): So how is Eliran gonna lively up the restaurant huh bae
Aldus (Jess): One if you rich bitches better be paying for Aldus's lunch <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina will pick up the tab 😘
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: thanks mommy 😘
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~that hurt to write blech~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): _new chibi confirmed_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *no please i dont wanna write more of that story*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Forgot I was gonna draw tonight.. shit, tomorrow!
