Bill: Fudge are actually a type of die, 6 sided with two blanks, two `-` and two `+`.
Bill: The game system Fate (which is what we're running Aurii on) uses them.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Here's what i have so far:
Vesper Dusseau
Birthday: April 7th
23 years old
5’7”
Human
Long auburn hair, syled into many braids with feathers and other ordaments 
Indigo eyes
Duel dagger fighter
Cunning, Sneaky, Competivie, Energetic, Resourceful, Mischievous
Bill: Sounds good.
Bill: Still working on it?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i want to think more about their relationship in relation to Aldus
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know what else tho
Bill: mmkay.. This is plenty to work off of for an introduction.
Bill: I should ask, so I describe correctly... are they a guy or a girl physically. Since you wanted them gender neutral before.
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk they're gender neutral
Bill: right... I understand that, but if they have titties that's going to be obvious looking at them.
Aldus Larian (Jess): not necessarily especially with armor
Bill: So their look is androgynous?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye!
Bill: mmkay...
Bill: I couldn't correctly describe the character without knowing that.
Nokri (Marisa): Can’t describe their appearance? Or their personality?
Bill: appearance.
Bill: Which isn't indicative of what they identify by, I'm not saying that before anyone assumes I am.
Nokri (Marisa): Just describe a person :0
Nokri (Marisa): Like this?
Nokri (Marisa): Jess already wrote the appearance :0
Bill: ,...
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> what was king Afrin's name.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Achelous
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its a river <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: thanks.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is what I have now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): **Current age: 25**
*Childhood:*
•    Grew up in Kisselain territories
•    Father was tiger laguz, mother was human
•    Parents were refugees and among the first to settle in Kisselain territories
•    Ingrained in him to be proud of his laguz traits
*Dreca attack:*
•    Age: 22
•    Father stayed behind to fight, told Chengu to take his mother and run
•    Mother was wounded at some point
•    Ran off with his mother into Eraia
•    Encountered a group of Drecans who captured Chengu and his mother
*In Captivity:*
•    Upon capture, Chengu was separated from his mother
•    He was sent to work in the mines while his mother was forced into some other form of slave labor
•    A couple years later (i.e. present day), he is approached by some higher ups about an opportunity to gain him and his mother’s freedom
•    They would like him to accompany a Torshan noble to a party that is being held in Laera where they hope to obtain information on _______.
Bill: Why is Chengu special? What makes them select him over any other laguz ~~slaving~~ working in the conquered region?
Bill: That's not a complaint, just a prompt for thought.
Aldus Larian (Jess): have you *seen* him?
Bill: That is entirely a valid reason.
Bill: The noble could have a type.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the power of the sexy
Bill: or the warden at Chengu's prison camp wants to be rid of him.
Bill: Or he impressed a higher up in breaking up a fight between a soldier and a slave without causing more damage to either party, and the higher up remembered his name.
Bill: how long had Afina been in Theanovene?
Bill: <@!245270932602486784>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I've only had Vesper for 30 mins but if anything ever happened to them I'd kill everyone in this room and then myself.
Nokri (Marisa): i imagine them like a pokemon who just goes around saying "vesper, vesperrr"
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: Don't forget they are an NPC, and you don't actually play them. :3c
Bill: Same thing I told Tom about San.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😦
Aldus Larian (Jess): time to write fan fic for my own ocs
Bill: Go for it.
Bill: But I am sticking to you're playing one character.
Bill: That said... Before I post an opener, do you want to consider switching?
Bill: That is an option.
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk i dont wanna abandon aldus
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt mean for vesper to really become that important but you wanted more info and now im attached
Bill: I needed info on their organization, so I could use it to give Aldus more screentime. I'm good with what you gave me for Vesper.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo yea i dont really remember what your basis for the organization was since you kinda changed that last week and i forgot to copypasta
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!184437198865563648> my idea was about a year, she gets kicked around 20/21
Bill: kk.
Aldus Larian (Jess): so yea i dont have much on the organization
Bill: ```8:29 PM] Bill: So the gang are

Freedom fighters, who want to overthrow the current king of Torshan

They have a noble in charge, who says the king is going to ally the region with Dreca

The noble is raiding houses that support the king to weaken him and get money to fund the revolt

They'll take anyone whose strong and willing to do the dirty work they do, hence Aldus.

They basically operate by handing orders down to raid place X, and that's all Aldus has to know at the start. (the orders can even go to your NPC friend with the daggers, so Aldus just works with them)```

that was the summary block.
Bill: If you don't really care about the organization, you can leave it aside. I'll write in the details as I need them.
Bill: It's not crucial Right.Now either so...
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye thats fine
Bill: Then we're set.
Bill: Congrats we're live!
Nokri (Marisa): fiRST
Bill: I assume everyone can set their own character in the scene provided. I'll start throwing hooks around once everyone has established where they're characters are at, ~~threw passive aggressive comments at each other~~ and what they're doing.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH WE BACK
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YOU ASSUME THAT THE LONG WEITING WAS FOR DICE
Bill: I don't, but I do know some people started to tune out long posts.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah understandable
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'll try to cut but.for quality control reasons
Bill: Just write what you want to say is all. If it's long and quality content, fantastic.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): There's so much info I gotta put into the first post,and that's cutting it short even 😭 I think it has to be longish unfortunately
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Even glazing over parts
Bill: That’s okay, it’s not specific to this post just a general notice.
Bill: It’s going to be most relevant to combat, since that’s where you needed dice.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah, very true
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Elfriede must **embellish**
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom must embellish you mean
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): **ELFRIEDE MUST EMBELLISH**
Aldus Larian (Jess): can i control vesper in this scene or nah?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Im.gonna control.san for this scene <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: You can bring them in, just keep in mind you don't get two characters.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I just need to introduce her to the scene so I figure it'll be the same for you
Bill: I gotta get final lists of headcanons for both of them, since it sounds like you've been coming up with more Jess and I didn't right down San's stuff.
Bill: At that point I'm going to add to them myself, with respect to the head canons, as needed. They'll be NPCs in my pool of weapons to use against you.
Bill: I mean support you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ```
Vesper and Aldus have a non defined flirting relationship at the time of the party. Aldus isn’t sure if this is just a part of their normal behavior (as they are a generally playful person) or if Vesper is genuinely interested in him, or is just having fun. Nevertheless the two flirt back and forth on frequent occasions. Vesper and Aldus have known each other about 3 months. They are often partners on missions together and Vesper has taught Aldus a few things about dagger fighting as well. Vesper will deflect personal questions that Aldus asks them with jokes, or questions of their own. 
```
Thats what i have
Bill: Mmkay, so that'll cover it?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i guess
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wanna write actual timeskip stuff but i gotta write the actual post first
Bill: mmkay. If I add things to Vesper for plot and story purposes, I'll respect everything listed, but I'm going to do what I want to do with them. That's basically the gist.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmm ok
Bill: That applies to San, did to Yuria, Achelous...
Bill: etc.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i guess i didnt realize that
Aldus Larian (Jess): too late now i guess
Bill: Like I said, you can't play two characters...
Bill: Options open if you want to play Vesper until you post though.
Bill: Doesn't kill off Aldus, Aldo will just be around.jpg until he's involved (or just exists in the background).
Aldus Larian (Jess): I didnt think id be playing 2 i just thought id be able to write for vesper when they are around, but youd be able to control when they were around i guess? like i didn't intend for them to be  permanent fixture of the party
Bill: You can write the minor stuff. Like them at the party and stuff. I'm just making it clear, there's a chance I may say 'I need an NPC for the story arc, Vesper would be a good fit' and I'll be using the character.
Bill: Like how Yuria was going to be an arc story originally.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok cool!
Bill: So if there's anything big, I'll be writing them. Inconsequential stuff like party mingling or banter with Aldus can be all you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yaaay!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina: sees Elfriede across the room
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Orchestra: starts playing orchestral version of “why can’t we be friends”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aldus come up behind her
"Its the internalized racism"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Aldus starting singing “it’s your racism” to the beat of “why can’t we be friends”
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG YES
Aldus Larian (Jess): it’s your racism (4x)
ya seen him ya seen him ya seen him 'round for a long long time
but you but you but you just can figure out why you hate that guuyy
it’s your racism (4x)
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~isn that song like literally about racism?~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Probably
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or about war
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): One of those two
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): War can be racially driven so ya know that’s probably accurate
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _also the band is war which makes that ironic_
Aldus Larian (Jess): i keep read aurii-main as "Aurii on main" like "horny on main"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh wait they mentioned skin color yup
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive been staring at this one sentence for like 30 mins on and off
Aldus Larian (Jess): I assume afina is somewhere near the king as he give his speach?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooo you starting writing post?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye she’s probably standing near him for formal reasons
Aldus Larian (Jess): attempting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Prob with her mum
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and her date_
Aldus Larian (Jess): DATE who date? owo
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~is is nokri?~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I have emine mostly written as well
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I need to fix a bunch of stuff
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh sassy aldus is coming out now , where'd he come from
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also I read Georgia's first message as
"Lock eyes,from across the room, down my drink as the rythems boom."
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Or rather my mind changed it to that
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmfao
Nokri (Marisa): Is everyone getting a hot date for the party
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~is your date afina?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~is it a secret~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~Nokri shows up with a date who she ditched for Afina~~
Nokri (Marisa): That’s politics
Aldus Larian (Jess): nice
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh fuck im writing a damn book over here
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah.. me too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Alkost done tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Gotta to set up unfortunately
Aldus Larian (Jess): im still doing set up XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): is there like a seating chart? is there like an aurri table?
Bill: Technically everyone is Aurii... but no, you all aren't at the same table.
Aldus Larian (Jess): what are da seating arrangments?
Bill: What do you mean...?
Aldus Larian (Jess): are we all at different tables? are we siting according to our kingdoms? race? does it not really matter?
Bill: Calloran regions are group together, neighboring kingdoms and such. Elfriede and other foreigners are one section.
Aldus Larian (Jess): would i be a "foreigner?" or would i sit with the Torchanians?
Nokri (Marisa): Do the tables have those fancy place settings with name cards then? Otherwise where would Nokri go and how would everyone know where to be
Bill: The serving staff directed you to your seats when you arrived.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh uhhh
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok
Nokri (Marisa): Bold of you to presume people remember where they’re supposed to sit at a party
Aldus Larian (Jess): i thought it was cocktail hour
Bill: It is, but you have seats for when the food is served...
Nokri (Marisa): Aren’t cocktails and horse dorves usually served in another location before the main meal?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea or like same space but no one finds thier seats until meantime
Bill: Does this really matter...
Aldus Larian (Jess): well whatever, aldus hasnt found his seat at but he was at da bar which i put on the balcony thingy?
Nokri (Marisa): I think we expected the party to start from the very beginning/with arrivals since a lot of focus was put on how they were getting to the party, so it’s a bit jarring that the party’s now in full swing
Nokri (Marisa): That’s how I saw it
Bill: Sure, there's a bar on the balcony.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoo!
Bill: Main bar is probably lower level though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): bars a bar, theres 2 bars
Nokri (Marisa): Barred from the bar
Bill: The arrivals would be a boring opening. We don't need to roleplay people taking your coats and guiding you to your seats and so on, so forth.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): all I know is that I want Chengu to grab a glass of champagne from a waiter's serving tray with is tail as he walks by
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just needed a little better idea of the space and current situation so i could role play properly, thank
Nokri (Marisa): Yee
So there’s a lot of people there? Like several hundred?
Bill: mm... probably between 100~150.
Bill: guests.
Nokri (Marisa): Das reasonably small, everyone could’ve seen each other when they came in. Always gotta scout the people who’re there. 👀 
~~not saying to change it just pwaying dewil’s adwocate~~
Bill: The rooms not small enough you'd have missed each other at all.
Bill: I'm just not forcing your characters to take to one another.
Nokri (Marisa): O, so we could’ve spotted one another across the room already
Nokri (Marisa): See these be important details that go against the implications of the post
Bill: I don't see where I said "you have no idea each other are at the party".
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye Im amusing afnias like front and center so aldus saw here and now i have him going into the party proper where hell prob notice elfy and nokri on his was down the stairs.
Bill: ^ and you all know Afina is there, cause she invited oyu.
Nokri (Marisa): By starting it right in the middle of the party I figured there would’ve been no prior interaction chances whoopsies
Bill: This is still the start though.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!351471675843411978> are you with Torshan people too?
Bill: It just skips the awkward first 15 minutes as people walk in.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmm not exactly? we the rebels, aldus had a personal invite from afine so im guessing the fact that hes comming from torchan isnt really known?
Nokri (Marisa): By “middle” I just meant that everything’s begun already and people are already there
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea were not doing like "Aldus Larian, hailing from Wynne" type announcements, or like red carpet type outfit montage entrances or anything
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri tips the announcer $20 to just go on and on about how great she is during her entrance
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh we're not doing announcementz?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **edot teim**
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh wait I didn't add that good
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean that was the impression i got at least
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Alright I m all done, but I'll wait til I get home to post
Aldus Larian (Jess): post nooowww
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ughhh but phonnnneeee
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oookayyyy
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There we are
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I think I got it all
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Hopefully
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I didn't wanna spend too much time.on travel
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But if we need.clarification for anything I can give
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh whoa
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt write for traveling 😮
Bill: No need to. If you want to explain more on his travels, have Elfie talk about it in person.
Bill: in grand tradition, good post
El🆓de Faun (Tom): WOO YEAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): GOOD POST ME
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah you don't need to
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wrote for traveling
Bill: I've know San for 15 minutes but if anything happened to her I'd kill all the PCs and then myself.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I just felt like I had to since I started writing before
El🆓de Faun (Tom): With those two short skits
Bill: ~~I'd be the reason something happens to her~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also understandable
Dizzy: Following keys updated: `elfriede`.

Fate Points: 3
Stress: [ ] [ ] [ ]
Consequences:
2  Mild:
4  Moderate:
6  Severe: 

Aspects:
1. Lyall is(n't) a priority Elfriede (and most of his family) does what he can to keep up appearances, and has even convinced himself otherwise, but his loyalty to Lyall doesn’t run all that deep.
2. Knight’s Code Will stick to the basic chivalrous knight code… mostly.
3. Avoid that eye contact Will get really embarrassed when he fails.
4. Hide the truth. Elfriede will try his best to hide his tail from everyone
5. My parents are lawyers. A bit sassy, especially to those he deems lower than him.

Approaches:
Careful: 0
Clever: +2
Flashy: +3
Forceful: +1

Dizzy: Elfriede Faun (elfriede) rolled **1** *[0, 0, 1, 0]*!

 Their `Flashy` stat is **3**, so total is 1+3=**4**!

Bill: Oh good it loaded correctly.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): GOOD POST
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive gotta do aldus sheet too
Aldus Larian (Jess): i forget how much aldus even knows about afina and elfy, its like next to nothing
Bill: "That closet furry wants to fuck that basic white girl"
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think he had even reached that concusion fully yet? he just noticed they smell simular
Bill: mm...
Aldus Larian (Jess): he literally knew them for half a day
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): good post, good post
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): got me excited to write something when I get home
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!245270932602486784>  and <@!351785752197201920>  what are your charcters general attitudes on aldus? if u dont mind me asking? its been so long and they barely talked
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok not as long as i thought it was going thank god
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hmmmm Afina probably thinks good of Aldus because she associates Aldus with Nokri
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Nokri is Afinas bestie lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She would be glad to see him
Aldus Larian (Jess): im trying to get back to my original character plan for Aldus ~~know that i dont have a certain bard telling me im stealing his ideas~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BuT gReEnS mY CoLoR
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm ThE FilIRty OnE In ThIS PArTY
Aldus Larian (Jess): as always please excuse my errors
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): pffft
Bill: He's definitely different than S1.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Thanks y'all 
And damn I honestly have no idea other than generalizations of aldus
El🆓de Faun (Tom): From Elfriedes pov
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Elfriede thought aldus was nokris escort
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So a mercenary laguz
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He generally doesn't trust laguz he first meets
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But that could be retconned
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He hasn't been overtly rude to aldus
Aldus Larian (Jess): Okey dokey
Aldus Larian (Jess): At least he didn't threaten him in a bathtub
El🆓de Faun (Tom): They said one thing each to eachothher
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEP
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That's when Elfriede began to hate the bard 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~So when you say different is that like good different or bad different~~
Bill: Personally? I'm not sure yet. He's like a new character.
Bill: Gameplay wise you're fine though.
Bill: As long as you don't try and out Nokri Nokri you can play your character as you see fit. ~~there's only enough tolerance on Aurii for one of Nokri~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I couldn't really express Aldus the way I wanted to with interactions with eliran and nokri.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wat?
Aldus Larian (Jess): You're getting nokri vibes?
Bill: Nah.
Bill: I'm saying don't be Nokri.
Bill: Just as a general statement.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I wasn't going to lol
Bill: Since you feel like this is closer to the true Aldus it's good Jess.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GOOD POSTS GUYS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just left rocket club I’ll start typin when I get home
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also I’m glad Aldus has a fancy braid cause I was imagining the same thing TBH
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aww ye
El🆓de Faun (Tom): WOO GOOD FUCKING POST
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa thank
Aldus Larian (Jess): O hope my afina defense squad thingy came across the right way

Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~She gonna make the light come out their ass cuz shes magic. Haha get it?~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Btw if Rica is at this party Elfriede will lose his shit xD
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH I GOT IT
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wanna move my approach numbers around, how many points do we get for those?
Bill: You get a 3, two 2s, two 1s, and a zero.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok, so <@!184437198865563648> you said king of Torshan is trying to get on Dreca's good side by betraying the Calloran league. Why would he be sending my guy to this party then? Just to gain intel on what the other kingdoms might be up to? I'm trying to think up a reason why he'd be there in the first place and why Dreca would send Chengu to accompany him
Bill: King isn’t there. This is one of his supporters. Gather intel and keep up appearances. Why Dreca sent him could relate to why he was pulled from the work camp.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): okie doke
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo wait aldus overheard afina telling eriran the tea on efly
Aldus Larian (Jess): o hmmmmm i might have to edit post unless i retcon that he heard it 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): eriran no longer exists so consider it retconned lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): MWHAHAHa
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~why does tom have 2 stunts?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~can we have 2 stunts?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~no~~
Bill: No.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
