Bill: I thought about that a bit, I like King Afrin hosting it because it serves as a motivation for Afina. iirc she had a chip on her shoulder to please her Dad, so it's a good chance to do it and makes the stakes of success personal.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's a free form rpg! So it starts and aldus just tears the letter in half and says, "who?"
Bill: nice.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): this scene has been coming to mind lately as y'all talk about this lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo ok, but like the rest of us are writing in our own motivation?
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless the party was Georgia's idea from the beginning?
Bill: Party was my idea...
Bill: Yes, you'd need your own reason to accept the invitation.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ah
Bill: You could tie it to the fact your father is there.
Bill: You hear about it and choose to show up.
Bill: You could even show up as part of the staff, like you were sneaking in to see him?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant talk about this right now co worker came back from lunch
Bill: kk!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MR AFRIN IS NO JACQUES SCHNEE
