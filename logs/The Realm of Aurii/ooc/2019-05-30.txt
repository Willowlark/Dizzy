El🆓de Faun (Tom): but dignified nobleman voice tm is playing in my head with every word and i cant stop i
El🆓de Faun (Tom): t
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s probably like almost accurate
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm having writer's block. I just can't think of why Chengu would be here ;-;
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bill said the noble guy would basically be my way in and could basically ditch him but I don't know why that would make sense to do but I also don't want to keep writing for the noble
El🆓de Faun (Tom): first of all
GOOD POST FREN
**GOD I HATE HIM ALREADY, GOOD JOB**
El🆓de Faun (Tom): also understandable Erik
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i'd like to help but i feel like i dont know enough about Chengu to attempt to assist 🤔
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is this a frat guy?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): neither do I tbh lmao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): so i feel like i got a sense of his personality
Aldus Larian (Jess): So your there with a noble?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): but not his occupation
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i get rogue vibes but is he break the law rogue or cunning charisma rogue
Nokri (Marisa): potholes, man. can't even escape them in fantasy
Nokri (Marisa): nice posts 👏
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): welp, there it is

El🆓de Faun (Tom): what a suppressed boi
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ooops i meant oppressed*
Aldus Larian (Jess): GOOD POST
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i almost wrote some other -pressed word but i cant remember what it was and i switched it to suppressed and was like "Yeah, this is right"
Nokri (Marisa): steam-pressed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): compressed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): depressed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): give me more presses y'alll
El🆓de Faun (Tom): impressed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ANYWAYS YEAH I LIKE CHENGU

Nokri (Marisa): dang it
Nokri (Marisa): immunosuppressed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OoO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): thanks <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not sure I wrote his personality exactly the way I wanted it to be, but I think once he gets more tied into the story it'll get there
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yeah for sure
El🆓de Faun (Tom): when i started i had Elfriede written as such a stuck up lil shit
El🆓de Faun (Tom): like he thought he was smarter than everyone
El🆓de Faun (Tom): but as soon as i started playing
El🆓de Faun (Tom): he did not come across that way at all
El🆓de Faun (Tom): like when we started 2 years ago
El🆓de Faun (Tom): (almost 2 years ago)
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wow chengu hasnt transformed in years! welcome to the Lagu but doesnt transform club
El🆓de Faun (Tom): cept one mishap with an archbishop that was a bit messy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): but that never happened according to the Eraian Government <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was more so that he wasn't allowed to transform while imprisoned
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yeahhhh thats what we figured but he can keep his mebership til he transforms next
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aldus is a permanent member
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YAY GOOD POST
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This is so exciting the gang is all together
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Time for Nokri to fuck it up <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _what do you mean I have to wait til next wednesday_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): At least the “when is post day” memes can come back
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yessss post day memes!!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ✨✨ Nokri will dazzle us ✨✨
Bill: So if Kieron is more than a bit piece, I need the same blurb of headcanons I got for Vesper and San from you Georgia.
Bill: Also I read it twice, but I didn’t see where he *actually* spilled anything in Afina so I get the distinct feeling it’s an excuse to get her alone and I may have him killed? Idk.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I believe the purpose was to get her alone
Bill: -_-
Bill: Zen: men are BEASTS
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The seamstress may ship it
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But we sure don't <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Didn’t we have enough assault vibes from trisp?
Bill: ~~that reminds me I have to change dizzy cause San x Elfie is quality~~
Bill: Anyway.
Bill: Blurb if he’s not going to get slapped and written out in the this scene.
Bill: ~~should I throw out the whole plot and turn this into big brother relationship drama in Laera cause I *get the feeling* that’s where we’re headed~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): She did have the short story but I think he was only talked about a bit in that and not actually in it 🤔
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I get them rich entitled will cry to mommy at the first sign of danger vibes
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like the dude from frozen who's like "if only anyone loved you" or prince charming from Shrek
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Good character 👌
Bill: “Good” in the sense that he immediately trips my “keep women away from” vibes even as fictional character.
Bill: 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Absolutely
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Need the characters you don't like personally in stories too 👌
Bill: Mm.
Bill: I just you know. Have white knight syndrome so.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm just saying don't kill him off just because he makes you uncomfortable  <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: ~~but I want to and don’t have a PC to kill him with~~
Bill: (I’m not going to)
Bill: ~~V route also making me question the healthiness of some of my ways of thought anyway~~
Bill: Anyway, blurb if Afina isn’t blowing light out of his ass at this party. Cause prime asshole is good villain material.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I know it's a type but It says "spilled anything *in* afina" and I died
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i didn't like him as soon as he grabbed afinas wrist~~
Bill: Time to flood the room with some respect women juice.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~OR afina could save herself if need be since she's fully capable~~
Bill: ~~you know that’s a metaphor right~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): You said you wanted to kill him tho
Bill: Sure *I* do. As a person reading about the character.
Bill: As a GM my opinions have nothing to do with it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok
Bill: It’d actually be a waste cause I can already see a political story arc forming around this guy and his family.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Remember that time Elfriede got drunk and told afina that laguz last longer in bed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Good times
Bill: Any actual GM decisions will go in the announcements. So it not confusing.
Nokri (Marisa): i gotta find a name uuugh
Nokri (Marisa): arnold bigbucks and titus rich aren't gonna cut it i don't think
Aldus Larian (Jess): aww man why not
Nokri (Marisa): plus *two* to a formal party? pls, nokri's not ~~a lego~~  *an animal*
Aldus Larian (Jess): escuse uuuu aldus has one date and chengu has none
Nokri (Marisa): nokri casually steals chengu's date
isn't he the plus one tho?
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea i think so
Nokri (Marisa): where's that winter moon image again aaa
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats her that nokri
Nokri (Marisa): Me: “ok Nokri now be nice”
Nokri: oozes malice
Bill: I don't think I need to do a GM post, we can just move to next round?
Bill: I assume characters will start bumping into each other.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao good post Marisa, good post xD
Bill: If anyone would like NPC interaction let me know. Elfie and Aldus are on the dance floor, Afrin heading there, Nokri is Nokri, and Chengu needs an introduction.
Aldus Larian (Jess): GOOD POST
Aldus Larian (Jess): nokri on dance floor too!
Bill: ah yes correct. Have at it then.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah Kieron is basically Tom from SVTFOE and also every fuckboi in gym that tried to hard
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Those were my inspirations
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Little small bit of Hans from Frozen too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But only cause he’s been helping Afina just cause he wants some fuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): you nailed it XD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t think he’s outright EVIL but he thinks he’s entitled to a lot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Chengu is just a confused tiger boy who has no clue what's going on but is trying to have an okay time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and Nokri is already picking on him_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m glad I could write an NPC that everyone hates on sight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, Georgia, glad you mentioned the other nobles from Torshan in your post. That's basically how I was able to get rid of my guy for now because he's probs gonna go meet up with them to discuss noble type things
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aldus is gonna see nokri pick on chungu and be like "i feel you dude"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Aldus just looks over like _big mood_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lemme make some NPC blurbs for Kieron
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He basically grew up in Torshan, and then moved to Dwyr and his mom was so smart they made her military specialist
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So all his friends are from “back home”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought him saying _our_ friends when Afina has no idea who these bitches are is a nice touch
Nokri (Marisa): There’s no evidence for or against the idea that Nokri may be drugging her guy with aphrodisiacs in his medicine
Nokri (Marisa): Or may not be
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nokri puts aphrodisiacs in the punch bowl
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _now it’s a party_
Nokri (Marisa): Aside from the tongue click and maybe the staring she’s not being outwardly rude, it’s just her inner monologue  <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): Don’t drink the kool-aid
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im not quite sure where to go with kieron now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): afinas gotta find a way to ditch him
Nokri (Marisa): He has a sudden aneurysm and dies on the spot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): are we supposed to like... devolve the party into chaos cause that sounds bad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): a heart attack
Nokri (Marisa): With or without guidance from the DM the players are gonna make everything devolve into chaos
Nokri (Marisa): Yehaw
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): theres no way this congregation of 5 people and some of their +1s would not ruin this party
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like Kieron could have a Zuko redemption but that would be very hard
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nokri comes in with a bottle of shimmering teal liquid
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I gotta read but I'll do in a bit!
Nokri (Marisa): I got midway through and went “yeah. I’m lost. This’ll do.”
Nokri (Marisa): And then I dabbed
Nokri (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _nokri dabbed at a formal event?_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im tryna give kieron hobbies, do we have an aurii eqivalent to football
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im tryna make him as as stereotypically masculine as possible
Nokri (Marisa): Ballfoot. The latest hot sport.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im gonna have to piggyback off of someone else to see how afina can ditch kieron
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): maybe she can blink "SOS" at nokri and she steals the belt holding up his pants
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ballfoot. Where dudes literally just kick each other in the balls. Last one standing wins
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ultimate test of manliness
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri can see her talking with other rich people and think, “perfect. I can meet more rich people” and go up to talk to her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _Kieron: hey elfriede you wanna pLAY SOME BALLFOOT_
Nokri (Marisa): Right there on the dance floor
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Kieron is a human dick measuring contest
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _hey remember that time nokri poisoned everyone so they switched genders_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *LETS NOT REMEMBER IT*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nokri does it again _Vesper is unaffected_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Elfriede YEP I GO FIRST *JUST PUNCHES HIM ACROSS THE FACE*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wait am I playing wrong
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _no sir this is perfectly acceptable carry on_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): how much do i need in an NPC blurb
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Kieron Bardolph
-Dark brown hair, green eyes, toned build
-Son of Lady Viola Bardolph, the military advisor for the Laeran Council
-Originally from Torshan, moved to Dwyr in his late teens
-Lives in Dwyr because his mother has more opportunity as a councilwoman in Laera than a mining supervisor in Torshan; still identifies mostly with the Torshan culture and beliefs
-Received knight’s training at the same academy Afina attended for a short time
-Enjoys fox hunting, dark magic, swordplay, homebrewing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!184437198865563648>
Bill: That’s fine. I’m calling them headcanons cause that’s all they have to be, just so I don’t write something that different than you imagined and you go “wow Bill way to ruin everything”.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yup and the way i feel he is played is probably like 70% Tom from SVTFOE, 20% Draco Malfoy, and 10% Hans from Frozen
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): though utilize him as you wish, i had no plans beyond needing Afina to do certain things lmao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I just remembered the child light mage scholar
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Plz bring them back
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Someday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): only tru 90s kids remember
Bill: Oh he’d be a great villain for an arc. It’d related to Torshan politics, Dwyrs relation to it, Afina’s responsibility as princess...
Bill: And that arc would be afina centric. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Though Aldus would play a strong secondary role.
Bill: But cause Afina doesn’t need more focus, I’m loathe to pull that thread.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): chengu is doin all that torshan stuff tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so does that mean the post rotation is happening as people finish btw?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): or is that just cause we dont need another GM post yet
Bill: Cause we don't need it.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): GOOD POST
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I love how his last name is Muns <:lenny:395307171539189760>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Beautiful
Bill: Look for opportunity to get Chengu roped into the conversation with the group as a whole.
Nokri (Marisa): I could have Nokri say something snide to him in passing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Chengu snarls in her wake
Bill: Nokri is not the best representative of the group.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Good! Variety!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i mean if you want the racist to do it..._
Nokri (Marisa): She’s pretty representative of the human group <:lenny:395307171539189760> one of two racist humans
Aldus Larian (Jess): we have 3 legos and 2 racist humans good party
Nokri (Marisa): Game over we did it we made the perfect party
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~hatefucking, hatefucking everywhere!!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): arguably afina may be the less worse racist now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): shes questioned a lot of those attitudes because she kissu'd a lego
Nokri (Marisa): The Lego in dreca are mainly forced laborers/slaves right? So that’s probably what Nokri is accustomed to. If some rich noble Lego were to appear she’d still be racist but suck up to them as well
Nokri (Marisa): How do I make her not racist <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): Aldus help
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _dont ask me man, afina wasnt meant to be a racist as she has been_
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): do u want him to take his shirt off again?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _aldus, strip in the middle of the party_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if chengu wants to do some RECON he should figure out who to talk to
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afinas a good candidate
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): a passing noble could remark about afina and dwyr working with torshan
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aldus is a fellow laguz if hes feeling shy around humans
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe my nameless noble comes back to me to tell me to try and befriend Afina and get on her good side ~~so he can find out secrets~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): which would also save her from kieron so she would be more accepting than usual <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~hot~~ tiger lego sounds more appealing than a super chad human
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SUPER CHAD
