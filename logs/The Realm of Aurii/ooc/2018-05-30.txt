Nokri (Marisa): this but nokri is veering uncontrollably in the other direction
Nokri (Marisa): i just wrote a random action but if it clashes with everything else I can rewrite it. goal was to test the waters and try to buy a headband then go to bath after if successful
Eliran (Halim): nokri u in enemy territory don't forget
Nokri (Marisa): do you think the town will be overly hostile? should she stick with the rest and not go testing these random townsfolk. maybe seeing the absence of a caste system made her overly optimistic
Eliran (Halim): Considering rogue eraians seem to be kidnapping drecan looking people and Eraia is a holy war fueled society
Eliran (Halim): probably bad idea? i think breaking off from the group is probably unwise
Nokri (Marisa): tru
gonna revise
Nokri (Marisa): nokri is the little kid who's always upset and makes the roadtrip suck for everyone else
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Idk like.. overall trisp is pretty docilr
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: But I'm sure nokri would put maybe a few of them on edge
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Nokri quick pretend your eastern Eraian, some folks can't tell the Difference!
Nokri (Marisa): she's just *really* tanned. lots of horseback riding y'know.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Need nokri with Elfriede stat, won't have to worry about dumb angery Eraians
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: ~~except Elfriede~~
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: ~~but only for a hot sec~~
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Infinity wars is the most ambitious cross over event ev-- **AURII TABLE MERGE**
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Did we get a consensus on the table merge as to HOW they're meeting
Nokri (Marisa): is the bathhouse out
Nokri (Marisa): we could start a commotion on the street
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: No idea really lmao
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): How will I know what to think about _when I zone out in class then_
Bill: come up with an idea? then you can share after.
Bill: ~~or photoshoots~~
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): I diiid no one liked it
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I'm really fine with anything at this point
Bill: *more ideas*
Bill: I think people took your idea too far though, turning it into a big kidnapping thing. Unless Nokri makes herself obvious to members of the military, the townsfolk aren't going to attack her.
Bill: They may *call* the military, but civilian Eraians aren't very familiar with Drecian racial features.
Bill: So kidnapping was an extreme.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): So there has to be a commotion caused
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): ~~like I said~~
Bill: It's a good way to throw everyone in together. I'm not seeing combat, but definitely not mundane's ville like bumping into each other on the street.
Bill: though, Afina and Eliran know each other already. That can spark things too.
Aldus (Jess): Pretty sure there's been a commotion everywhere table 1 has gone
Aldus (Jess): *Aldus buys Nokri a hairband* "
Aldus (Jess): NO WAIT
Aldus (Jess): *Aldus buys everyone matching hairbands*
Bill: * except Nokri
Aldus (Jess): WORSE: buys Desii a hairband
Bill: *whyisthatworsewhat*
Aldus (Jess): cuz nokri is all jelly of desii
Bill: *I'm not adverse to this*
Bill: Desii's like the only not racist female in the game, Aldo deserves her. üòõ
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: GET ELFRIEDE A HAIRBAND
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: BECOMES** MARTH**
Bill: Afina, in a 'you scum voice': "Dog"
Nokri, in a 'I'm talking to an animal' voice: "Dog"
Desii, "I don't see any dogs...?"
Aldus (Jess): so right now table 1 is just walking into town right?
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): _theres only enough room for ONE blonde with a hairband in this town_
Bill: Desii has brown hair.
Bill: I believe so.
Bill: Ya'll gunna get the old lady bucket if you don't say you stopped at the bath house before getting into town proper tho.
Bill: aren't you supposed to be in class Georgia?
Aldus (Jess): *writes aldus fan service*
Aldus (Jess): or more me fanservice
Aldus (Jess): wait tha came out wrong
Aldus (Jess): Aldus me-service
Bill: fanservice for you yes.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): I am but the teacher stepped out ;3c
Bill: you can also just be like 'and then they took baths. after that,...'
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): _implied bathing_
Aldus (Jess): or i could talk about how water droplets caresses his slim, toned body as he palms coconut shampoo through his majestic locks
Bill: ~~Do I call the smut table a table or a bed~~
Aldus (Jess): i thought table 2 was the smut table
Bill: I'm talking the steamy stuff, not just *hand holding*. That's like, barely lukewarm shower.
Bill: We need full on hot springs steamy.
Bill: ~~who'd find hand holding steamy anyway right lol~~
Aldus (Jess): psh thats nothin
Bill: y-yeah, totally.
Aldus (Jess): if we dont figure out how the tables are meeting, im doing a fanserice scene
Bill: Do the fanservice scene.
Bill: the rest can write itself.
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: ~~wait fuck writing bath house scenes for Desii will be way too awkward for me shit~~
Aldus (Jess): desii goes into lockeroom, then she undressed, and got in the tub, and washed herself, and dried off and got re dressed and letf the bath house"
Aldus (Jess): that wasnt hard lol
Bill: This is in the instance shenanigans occur in the bath house, as has been tossed around.
Bill: It's not strictly a bad idea.
Aldus (Jess): nokri and desii naked fight in the bathhouse
Aldus (Jess): everyone leaves
Aldus (Jess): the staff call in aldus and eliran to clear the fight
Aldus (Jess): eliran doesnt care at all but aldi is super flustered
Bill: Afina tries to arrest Nokri in the name of... the Fauns, probably.
Aldus (Jess): ~~imma write the boner~~
Aldus (Jess): oh
Bill: Afina gets in a fight. Elfriede hear a scream.
Bill: shit.
Aldus (Jess): my idea was more fun
Aldus (Jess): wait so are we meeting in the bath house?
Bill: _shrugs_
Bill: If you write the scene so you're still in the bath house at the end of your post, maybe?
Aldus (Jess): Aldi falls asleep in the bathtub
Bill: you'd be leaving a *hook* for someone to take and use to add more to the scene.
Aldus (Jess): yea seeing Aldus naked would be quite the hook
Bill: S'long as someone takes the hook, a scene starts to build around it.
Aldus (Jess): ughhhh i srsly have no idea what to do
Aldus (Jess): <@!288513265661902858>  and i discussed a little about how we feel rushed yesterday
Bill: I just don't know how to fix that. I get you feel that way, but unless you want to go do something other than Trisp, I'm not sure what I can do. Georgia and Tom do not set a merge timeline, if you want to take some time for something else, you can.
Bill: I just don't know what you want to do in the meantime.
Aldus (Jess): idk i think its kind hopeless
Bill: What does *Aldus* want to do?
Bill: Anything in particular?
Aldus (Jess): find his dumb flower
Aldus (Jess): that litteraly the only reason he has for being here besidesthe enera thing
Bill: Go find the flower then. Ask around town, visit the markets, talk to a florist, sniff a bush.
Aldus (Jess): ok but i still wanna play with otehr players
Aldus (Jess): Im not gonna go off on my own and have a lone wandered table while everyone else saving lost kids
Bill: Nothing says you have to do anything. (That said, I'll likely tie your off activities back into the Enera storyline cause that's sort of our central event for the town.)
Bill: Walking about town apart from the group is not enough to warrant a table split. If your plan involves going for 3 months apart from the group, then we'd be talking table.
Aldus (Jess): i wanna see what other people wanna do too but that means i ont be writting a post till alte tongiht
Bill: Do Aldus, not table-1. The game will write self around Aldus's actions to keep him in the loop.
Bill: spoilers, but the first thought I had to you looking for the flower would be for you to find out the church controls harvesting of it. Suddenly you have a reason to be at the monastery for your own purposes.
Aldus (Jess): ooo hmmm see that's not spoilers though under the new "collaborative writing" thing
Bill: Aldus is not a Nokri either, he blends in where he's needed. Characters that actively oppose groups are problematic and need tricks to be kept in the loop, like Nokri. Everyone else is not like that, and ride the plot threads well enough that they can split and rejoin later without that much effort.
Bill: Well, I don't know if I'd go with that idea (always worth coming up with more than one idea, the first idea you have is not always the best) and story elements I'm still trying to leave some surprises for.
Bill: We're collaborating on how those elements come about.
Aldus (Jess): walks up to elfriede "hey you got any of dat dank flower?"
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): afina: ELFRIEDE YOU DO DRUGS?
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Lmaoooooo
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I like the fanservice plot <:lenny:395307171539189760> do ett
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): DO IT JESS
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: *Make it like the soowon bathing scene*
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): O M G
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): i havent written any intricate afina bath scenes ~~yet~~ so that would be interesting
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): is table 2 doing a bath or was it implied
Bill: You don‚Äôt have to, the monastery is part of town so it‚Äôs not required.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): implied bathing it is yeehaw
Bill: Or... none. You bathe when you enter an Eraia town. That‚Äôs the only stipulation.
Bill: edgy phase Afrin?
Aldus (Jess): 
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: It true, but that's a neet outfit
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): OMG THAGS TOO REAL AHAHA
Eliran (Halim): Hi I'm here
Bill: Hi I'm here, I'm Dad.
Eliran (Halim): Hi Dad, I'm Father
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Is this fallout new Vegas, fallout 3, and fallout 4 summarized in order
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I THOUGHT THE SAME THING
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: YO
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): YOOO
