Nokri (Marisa): her traits....................................
-she lies (a little) but she wouldn't break the law (steal, murder for gain, mug someone) without a really important reason
-gruesome and medical stuff doesn't bother her, but she's not particularly interested in it outside of an occupation
-she wants everyone to have the best opinion of her and so acts in ways that will get people to like her
-she likes animals more than people because they don't say bothersome things
-she wants to live a stress-free life where she can be rich and powerful (or at least financially and socially secure) and not have to worry about anything
Nokri (Marisa): she acts in her own best interest at all times
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I want you to want me by cheap trick <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): like, one reason she might break the law is if a powerful king personally requested her to do it and promised her unbelievable riches in return. she'd be less likely to do it if it was just a rumor the king wanted something dirty done (but for plot purposes she might)
Nokri (Marisa): ooo that sounds promising
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rich Girl - Gwen Stefani
El🆓de Faun (Tom): NANANANANANA NANANANANANANA
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760> Hex girl by the hex girls <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): sounds spooky
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Elfriedea playlist: 50 plays of take me to church
