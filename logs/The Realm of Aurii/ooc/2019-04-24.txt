THANK MAH DOOD <3
We did write about our characters for a year or so, just draft it in a google doc and read it over. I liked to right bullet points of all the things i wanted to write about and then just delete them and fill them in with a full statement. It seemed to make it easier to formulate what i wanted to write. Like uhhh

*Elfriede gets sad about what afina told him
*He explains to Aldus that he indeed that he was a hippie
*Sighs at Nokri's declaration for her presidency
*Reminices a bit about some asshole talking down to him in a bathhouse even though hes in the mililtary for the region
