Bill: Mawisa does Nokri have any named soldiers from her unit in her backstory?
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo. Not that I’ve made, I can make one or you can create one. She’d of worked with a decent number of people, like a team of medics or a troop she was assigned to at one point.
Nokri (Marisa): They’d know her under a different name tho
Nokri (Marisa): Livestream won it’s up
Nokri (Marisa): Oh it’s ~starting soon~ so technically not yet. Aurii can still win. But the link is up.

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg I get the same baby name ads lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): im trying to stay away names that start with vowels
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): let's get come consonants up in this bitch <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: No more A or E names!
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no i made a list and the one i like the most is an A name hnsodgnsogn
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so what is the connection between Torsha and Dreca? i.e. Why would a Torshan Noble be in cahoots with Dreca to go to this party?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I'm actually being productive and have something good coming along~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~still just bullet points, but maybe some day I'll write out a whole story~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): me too fam dont worry
Bill: Torshan’s king thinks Dreca will win the war with Eraia and conquer the mainland. So he’s trying to get in good with them by betraying the Calloran league and joining Dreca. His supporters are other nobles, QED, your person.
Bill: All this is currently rumored at best to the rest of Callora though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok its been like 2 hrs but i have a name for them whoo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): do I need to make a name for my noble?
Bill: nah. TBH I'm not sure the noble will show up beyond your reason for getting into the party.
Aldus Larian (Jess): shit i never revised my bullet points after the last weeks discussion
Bill: I went to look at the last post and catch up before writing...
Bill: There is no last post this is a cold open lol
