Afina (Georgia🍀): he was a god of rationality that doesnt mean hes not also a hypocrite lmaoo
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> as I recall; most people didn't post for the thursday post anyway and I had called it a GM less round. The head table is where to put new posts, I believe the *Elfriede Bad Cop* aside is almost over, and it's time for the lot of you to meet. I'll reread full later, but I expect I'm only playing Desii this round.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeet
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll post when I get home
Bill: how'd that lab go?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i did it all this morning only for the due date to be pushed to wednesday
Aldus (Jess): the plight of the responsible student
Afina (Georgia🍀): so we post them all actually converging, and then afterwards we can aside them having a conversation between themselves?
Bill: mhmm.
Bill: yeah, uh, I'd rather wait to see Eliran and/or Elfriede post.
Bill: Hal, feel free to post again, as if there's a new round.
