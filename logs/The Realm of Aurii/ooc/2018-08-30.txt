Nokri (Marisa): what character is gonna be the one to say "but my feeeeeeet huuuuuuuurt" to the walking statement
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not lookin at Nokri but
Afina (Georgia🍀): O HEY MARISA YOU WANNA ASIDE
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH SURE GIVE ME LIKE 5 MINUTES
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEET I'll set it up
Afina (Georgia🍀): It'll be after Eliran and Afina talk but before what I last posted
Bill: I’ll be posting tomorrow evening, <@&358049600172589067>
Eliran (Halim): <@351471675843411978> wanna aside sometime tomorrow before post
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!351785752197201920> assuming that Elfriede can hear what Eliran and Nokri talk to Afina about, I think he's gonna have some feelings that'll be good for posting about 👌
Nokri (Marisa): idea: dark magic to take away elfriede's doggo power and give it to aldus <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Now you're thinking with Nokri <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Look Aldus has the ears already it doesn't even matter that Elfriede doesn't have them
Afina (Georgia🍀): Does that mean... TWO tails??
Nokri (Marisa): double doggo
double the fluff
Afina (Georgia🍀): All aboard the petty train
Afina (Georgia🍀): Toot toot 🚂
Nokri (Marisa): afina: "i've gained experience as a lover"
nokri: " <:lenny:395307171539189760> "
Afina (Georgia🍀): Petty Afina is too fun to write
Nokri (Marisa): honestly thought afina was gonna start saying "in laera, we believe our ability to attract suitors"
Nokri (Marisa): DOES AFINA'S NAME COME FROM THE WORD AFINITY
Eliran (Halim): Eliran overhearing Afina: "she calls that experience HAH"
Afina (Georgia🍀): IT DOESNT COME FROM AFFINITY BUT THE AFINA/EVERYONE SHIP NAME IS AFFINITY
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran corners Afina later "so I hear someone's a petty bitch"
Eliran (Halim): "Wanna play lovers and make him jealous"
Aldus (Jess): Uhh maybe? I'm super behind and I'm prob not gonna be able to catch up or post till afternoon tomorrow
Afina (Georgia🍀): Is Eliran secretly a god of chaos
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede goes to Eliran for advice later
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Your pseudo sister needs to stop insulting me because my self esteem is low but my libido is high, it's a very confusing and uncomfortable combo, make her stop."
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokris gonna shit a brick when she find out Afina's an only child
Nokri (Marisa): "them royals and their 10000 children to ensure a proper heir. afina probably has, like, 30 brothers."
Nokri (Marisa): afina is the avatar looking for a firebending teacher
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri pulls off cloak, I WAS THE DARK MAGIC TEACHER ALL ALONG
Nokri (Marisa): [zuko voice] "Hey guys. Nokri here."
Aldus (Jess): Ugh I'm so far behind 😭
Nokri (Marisa): i imagine we're just recreating the 3rd episode of yona where they're wandering around the woods running away
Afina (Georgia🍀): Youre not wrooong
Afina (Georgia🍀): You're not that far!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran and Afina just talked about furries
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina and Nokri are talking about magics, while Afina subtly throws emotional stones at elfriedes ego
Nokri (Marisa): nokri is too dense to understand so she just thinks afina likes talking loudly because royals are loud
meanwhile elfriede is like sobbing behind them
Afina (Georgia🍀): "What was that thud?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Oh... Elfriede must have tripped, don't worry princess"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Meanwhile he's just dead on the trail
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina took pot shots at everything, his country, his ability to teach, his lOvEr SkiLLz
Afina (Georgia🍀): The only thing she didn't touch was his family but that's cause logically speaking he would probably actually interject at that point
Nokri (Marisa): when afina lowers her voice that's when you know the REAL pot shots are happening. "oh lyarlel she's saying such mean things she can't even say them loudly anymore."
Afina (Georgia🍀): Can you imagine Elfriede tryna threaten tho
Nokri (Marisa): he huffs loudly "i am NOT. hmph."
Afina (Georgia🍀): "I SWEAR IF YOU TALK ABOUT YURIA I WILL--- mmmMMMM do nothing because you are royalty"
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): I'll catch up... Eventually
Aldus (Jess): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): You have some good content to work with when you do 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): Much anger
Afina (Georgia🍀): Very upset
Elfriede (Tom): Yeahh,it'll happen some time when my motivation returns
Elfriede (Tom): 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): When will my motivation return from the war
Afina (Georgia🍀): Dark Afina is such a motivator 👏 I can't wait til Afina has to sacrifice some shit
Nokri (Marisa): they get to an inn. afina and nokri enter a room by themselves giggling.
they lock the door.
"AIGHT. who we sacrificin' first?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): They gotta take a vote
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Lets sacrifice the Eraian" "but I like him" "you have to get over it Afina, he's prime sacrificial material"
Eliran (Halim): Eliran raises a hand in agreement, "the blood of a virgin maid is perfect, and as far as i can tell the boy has no balls"
Eliran (Halim): Also Eliran would definitely take pot shots at Elfriede
Afina (Georgia🍀): _the man's ego can't handle this many shots_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Real talk it's probably Eliran that has to realize "oh Elfriedes not actually a bad dude, Afina is just projecting her anger on him, when in reality, she's actually just conflicted about having a crush on a laguz"
Eliran (Halim): you over estimate eliran
Afina (Georgia🍀): is he not a smart dude
Eliran (Halim): cause even if i notices
Eliran (Halim): he doesn't care about Elfriede
Eliran (Halim): nah he's smart but like
Eliran (Halim): he has no reason to care about that
Afina (Georgia🍀): but hes probably pretty aware that afinas torn up about it yeah?
Eliran (Halim): yeah
Eliran (Halim): but like
Eliran (Halim): he'd focus on supporting her
Afina (Georgia🍀): "afina hes not a bad guy, you dont really hate him, youre just racist"
Eliran (Halim): nah he wouldn't do that
Eliran (Halim): he'd focus on getting over elfriede
Afina (Georgia🍀): i cant believe eliran has to get over elfriede
Eliran (Halim): Elfriede didn't take to Elirans advances in the bathhouse
Eliran (Halim): Eliran was very hurt ok
Dizzy: GM posts come out today.
Bill: I'm reading and then getting to posts.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> I dunno if Nokri would be the type to refer to dark magic as elder magic. Anyone whose serious about it and looks past the stereotypes would.
Bill: `Perhaps there is a family crest in it for you, with all these services," she smiled, ` That's a zing at Atlantia.
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> If it's up to me like we were talking about, Elfriede has been burned.
Aldus (Jess): Ha haha, there's pirates?
Bill: Ones Elfriede and Afina already pissed off.
Aldus (Jess): They are coming back?
Bill: they can smuggle you away from Eraia, for the price of helping them with the rebellion.
Bill: The pirates are actually the members of the Kouneli rebellion, trying to free themselves from Eraian occupation.
Aldus (Jess): I need Aurii abridged 😥
Bill: Things are recalibrating right now. Just get into it.
Bill: Afina and Elfriede are put out, Nokri is going to start hanging with Afina, everything’s shuffling. However Aldus dives in he can find himself in a better spot than before.
Elfriede (Tom): burned as in, everyone knows he killed someone?
Bill: At the least that he was involved.
Bill: Enough he’s wanted for questioning.
