Afina (Georgia🍀): _good aside bro_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YE
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: DEY CUTE ~~for now~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😭
Aldus (Jess): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus (Jess): Are you guys planning on waiting til.after the tables meet up?
Aldus (Jess): Cuz I think it could create some group wide discourse and drama if you do cuz elfriede and afinas dynamic will change and everyone will be like "wtf?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): >w>
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: ccccvvv
Aldus (Jess): Tom allready told me :P
Afina (Georgia🍀): T O M
Afina (Georgia🍀): to be fair the tables meet tomorow so its not much of a surprise
Afina (Georgia🍀): unless elfie and fina have the reveal RIGHT NOW its happening after the tables mesh
Aldus (Jess): Nah I meant more like "are you going to wait for us to see your regular dynamic" but he answered me
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah theres definitely gonna be time for that
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!184437198865563648> tables definitely meet tomorrow right
Bill: You’ll both be in Trisp?
Bill: Table-2 hasn’t actually gone anywhere in town, and table-1 hasn’t traveled there or said where they’re going.
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh okay
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats fair
Bill: Paths should cross quickly enough.
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause if theyre definitely meeting i couldve written that afina would maybe hear lute playing and he like huh thats familiar
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah
Aldus (Jess): Table one might might to go back to whatever town we we're in to check on them and the reinforcements?
Aldus (Jess): I mean it's not that important we could skip it but  I feel like it's quite the jump. Not sure what rest of table is thinking
Bill: well, there's a lack of table posts on both tables.
Bill: Which makes everything feel rushed imo.
Afina (Georgia🍀): im writing nowwww
Aldus (Jess): I did da post
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye jess is on fire today
Aldus (Jess): 🔥
Bill: Table 2 especially has started to do everything in asides. This is great character stuff, but I also need you to move about in your table posts so I have things to respond to.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 👌 just did boiiii
Aldus (Jess): <@&368096720187424778>  when you guys are around plz discuss what we want to do next
Bill: Good, just say what your intent is after the restaurant.
Aldus (Jess): I think we should check up in town and then discuss our plans for Trisp
Bill: Desii would be on board for that.
Aldus (Jess): ~~i honestly don't remember why table 1 is going there~~
Bill: Desii was asked to search for the innkeepers daughter while she went there; as she was putting distance between her and her mentor.
Eliran (Halim): eh it didn't make sense to me for them to cross a desert after being bruised and beaten, plus they wanted to help the town with the bandits a bit
Eliran (Halim): stopping in town to meet the reinforcements, confirm quest, and rest
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~are you telling me that table 2 could have spent another night spooning in the woods~~
Aldus (Jess): Sowwy
Bill: You guys can go ahead to the monastery, table 1 will catch up. I think I’d be good for one group to be more familiar with town than the other, gives you an easy bonding point of ‘show me around’
Aldus (Jess): Also <@301927856240459777>  read Aldus journal posty if you didn't already since it is mostly Aldus's missing about Nokri
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOOOO JOURNALS
Nokri (Marisa): WOAH WHAT aww ye 
That’s in birus site right
I was reading the post on table one but I had to reread it because I thought it said aldus was going for a walk and would be back in a week.
Aldus (Jess): I put it in aside 1
Aldus (Jess): Lmao "f u guys I'll be back in a week"
Nokri (Marisa): Oooo aside is a good place for journals
Afina (Georgia🍀): aldus: comes back with afina and elfriede
Aldus (Jess): ~~were all dating now~~
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri: NOT YET I NEED A SHOWER BEFORE MEETING ROYALTY
Aldus (Jess): ~~we have cured afinas racism~~
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: How did you convince my racist princess friend to join you
Aldus (Jess): Aldus: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: ~~you can't even transform for ultimate puppy eyes~~
Aldus (Jess): Aldus: don't call me out bro, elfriede refuses to transform
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina: elfriede what
Afina (Georgia🍀): [boom lego reveal]
Aldus (Jess): Afina: ITS OK THEY ARNT REAL LAGUZ
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: AFINA THAT JUST MEANS THEY'RE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATING FURRIES
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: _THATS NOT BETTER_
Aldus (Jess): Aldus: I WAS BORN THIS WAY
Afina (Georgia🍀): is afina happy or sad if someone is a shitty laguz
Aldus (Jess): 🎶and I was born this way I was born this way🎶
Afina (Georgia🍀): elfriede be like 🎵 i was surgically changed to be this way 🎵
Afina (Georgia🍀): i remember reading over the character sheets way early on and i saw elfriede and i was like oh thats cool hes a secret laguz im sure thatll have no bearing whatsoever on how i play tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): _how wrong i was_
Aldus (Jess): Cuz then Afina was like HEY I'm racsit
Afina (Georgia🍀): I NEVER 100% INTENDED FOR HER TO BE JUST RACIST
Afina (Georgia🍀): i intended for her to just be a jerk
Afina (Georgia🍀): but the idea EVOLVED
Nokri (Marisa): nokri be like "what the heck aldus I can't read your diary what language is this even what does it say"
Aldus (Jess): *exactly*
Eliran (Halim): mini aside <@!184437198865563648> <@!301927856240459777>  to clear some tension and maybe make some official choices?
Nokri (Marisa): [becomes a cipher cracker]

Nokri (Marisa): biru wake up. who needs work
Bill: Early morning tomorrow.
Eliran (Halim): i work
Aldus (Jess): Bill and Jess have exact opposite availability of Mawisa and Hal it is tragic af
Eliran (Halim): plus I feel like our posts are super asidey and nothings really happening
Aldus (Jess): I feel like we aren't having enough asides 😮
Eliran (Halim): that too
Aldus (Jess): Or at least enough finished asides 😭
Nokri (Marisa): yeah we've been starting to get to a chat but we need more, and we need more happening ~~woter~~
Aldus (Jess): Yea the whole opposite availability thing is really killing is tbh but there isn't much we can do about that
Nokri (Marisa): it might be inconvenient but it's possibly best if we just post whenever we can instead of having a set time for it? that way if we get like 10 spare minutes we can make a post, then wait for other posts, then continue in the next availability
Aldus (Jess): Posts? Or asides?
Nokri (Marisa): asides
Nokri (Marisa): aldus's aside really reminds me of a manga
Aldus (Jess): ~~thats the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me~~
Aldus (Jess): But yea doing asides like that works for me that's kinda what I was elluding to last week
Nokri (Marisa): ~~ye i stole your idea sorry~~
Aldus (Jess): Oh no! That's not what I meant 😮

Afina (Georgia🍀): afina and elfriede would threaten to do the do in aldus and elirans bodies but wouldnt actually be able to
Eliran (Halim): Eliran calls their bluff easy
Eliran (Halim): for 2 reasons
Eliran (Halim): 1. He knows they're way to pure to actually do it
2. He's perfectly fine with fucking Aldus 
3. Even if Afrin had residual interest in his body, He's pretty sure Elfriede is either way to closeted or way to straight to do it
Afina (Georgia🍀): then they just try to act like holding hands is revenge enough
Afina (Georgia🍀): _oh no what if they found out only after eliran and aldus were doing it in their bodies_
Afina (Georgia🍀): they show up like huh wow thats kinda neet actually
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Eliran (Halim): I wonder how it'd feel to see yourself getting fucked

Afina (Georgia🍀): 🤔🤔🤔
Nokri (Marisa): something uh
you might want to
that top file. check.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Real talk Afina's not the type to bring home to mom and dad, she's the type that you want on your laguz fighting squad cause she's a fuckin savage in that area
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YEET  👌 👌
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Afrins cute in the Naive Princes kinda way
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriedes main flaws are his lack there of normal emotional connection until now, brashness at times, ~~hiding a key part of himself~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: High self esteem in some areas and scarily low in others
Aldus (Jess): Aldus is a perfect bean
change my mind
Bill: `[11:27 AM] Elfriede (Tom) ♍: High self esteem in some areas and scarily low in others` <- that's a flaw? *whoops*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina's good parts are how she looks out for those that she cares about, and her commitment to being the best version of herself
Afina (Georgia🍀): Her flaws.... racism and naivety oops
Aldus (Jess): aldi is also naive, but it adds to her perfect bean-ness
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: This but Atalantia, Elfriede and Afina
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): Is there like a history of laguz conflict
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like on the GM blog
Bill: There’s a lot to that topic. Be more specific ~~so I can bullshit something~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Is there a signature historical event that marked the height of human and laguz tensions, and what broke said tension??
Bill: nothing is coming to mind immediately. I'll have to think on it.
Bill: 
Bill: `When she sees Nokri she smiles.` <things no one says
Aldus (Jess): When who sees her? 😮
Bill: fuck the spacebar isn't fixed that well.
Bill: This uncomfortable.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill did you mean to say Afina Tyndall of Laera instead of Trisp
Bill: Probably. Fix later
