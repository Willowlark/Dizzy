Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is this Elfriede's first time meeting Afina's mom?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeeppp
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have Stacy’s mom stuck in my head now
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Sammmeee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _hello Mrs Afina I didn’t kissu your daughter_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Now we just need Aldo and Noknok
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *Henlo I def didn't almost do nasties with your daughter henlo*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Plot Twist: It turns into a Kali/Sun-esque ship <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _does that make kieron adam_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If the rwby fandom was in charge of shipping aurii
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Miss Afinas husband is great from what I've heard
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Kinda a crazy tangent so I apologise
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I remember when we talked about the fog ™
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And it's kinda unknown but it kinda reminded me of fog in many other instances that makes people crazy during exposure
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And wouldn't it be tradgic if one of the main cast against their will just straight up killed somebody in the room and got arrested
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Hoo boy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And had no idea why
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _wouldnt it be tragic_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ~~My first thought was Elfriede attacking Afinas mom because he saw the bishop or something crazy~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Tragedyyyy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *do I smell foreshadowing?*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Idk if are rolling with the fog or anything tho, it wasn't mentioned in the opening
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~*If that were to hypothetically happen, might I suggest hypothetically killing the guy I came with, leaving a hypothetical opening for me to hypothetically go rogue on Dreca?*~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ~~maybe another npc does it?~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Afina mom fucking stabs that boi
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ruining all chances of treaties
El🆓de Faun (Tom): MAYBE RANSFORD?! Let's get crazy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I def want to see Rica and Ransford make returns
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I will offer up Kieron for a blood sacrifice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hes just such a douche
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Kieron is Torshan right?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Kieron kills Erik's dude
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Someone kills kieron
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Win win
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybe <@350855105123319808> or <@351471675843411978> s companions could do that?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~can i kill kiernon~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): or vesper w/e they ca do it too i guess lol
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I mean anyone could theoretticaly do it I'm just throwing stuff
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ooo big tragity
El🆓de Faun (Tom): San kills someone
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nooo I can't bear it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kieron is torshan ye
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If we did roll with the mist plot I'd get serious made in abyss vibes actually
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): in my mind I had my guy going of to meet up with Kieron and the guys he was with in Georgia's first post because Torshan... maybe my guy and Kieron get killed in the same blow in an attack against Torshans <:minathink:544567715931750405>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Hmm I don't even remember what plot we had agreed on
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah that's not a bad idea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~is this meta gaming?~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _yeah fuck torshan_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's okay we did this a shit ton
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): just cause we suggest it doesnt mean the GM will do it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yes it totally is but aurii I've always felt is less game and more story
Bill: I had an idea for kieron whenever the hell we started the thread, but all of my plot threads are lost to me. Again.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also true
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o does that mean that kieron wouldnt just be a bad guy he would be a BAD GUY?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *duh*
Bill: Exactly what Tom said. This leans heavily on the role play axis and collaborative storytelling. You can plan your stories, resolutions out. The dice exist to help move combat along.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _nice_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): sometimes we epically fail in dice too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao yeahhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like the time elfie and afina almost got stuck on that boat but used the power of racism to get away
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Elfriede was hella dead
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He's got a wicked scar on his tum from that
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And many Afina tears
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Good times
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): good times
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): anyways if two torshans get assassined at a callora party then everyones gonna look at mister afina to blame
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and so he sends out his dooghter and her merry band of misfits for diplomacy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i just want an excuse to kill kieron
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Then something REALLY BIG happens and sucks everyone into it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): portal to another dimension
El🆓de Faun (Tom): No isekais here
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and they end up in Remnant and it becomes RWBY fanfiction
Bill: Like a eraia consorting with the laera Princess?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): NO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): NO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lololol
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YOULL GIVE BILL WHAT HE WANTS
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmaoo that was the running thing for a while
Bill: Pfft. I did an April fools gag where I removed all of the channels for Aurii and made RWBY themed ones.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH FUCK I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That was halarious
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And WE STARTED PLAYING TOO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I FORGOT HEKSBDJOD
Bill: I don’t want to run a rwby play by post. I’d like to run an live game for rwby.
Bill: But I know it won’t happen.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Fuck we had a good time with aurii
Bill: Rip
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Elfriede was basically Weiss
Bill: So was Afina.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Good times
Bill: Elfriede was Blake.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I thoght elfy was blake
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ALRIGHT LETS KILL KIERON WOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE
El🆓de Faun (Tom): STAB THAT BOI
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also fun fact I saw my first actual Elfriede (the original) art at otakon and I said "Oh shit is that Elfriede art?" And Jess just accepted it like he was a mainstream character
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Then had a breif double take
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was like "oh cool!" 

WAIT
Aldus Larian (Jess): "That's not possible!"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The only shame is that Kieron is a dark mage
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That would’ve been cool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But Afinas ~~rebound~~ shitty lover needs to GO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bill what was the plot we were going with to begin?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If we can't remember the mist or something similar could work, but the problem I guess with the mist would be the lack of npcs
Bill: Like I said, I forgot it for the umtempth time.
Bill: ,... Fuck plans.
Bill: Can just bullshit the lot of it with whatever sounds cool in the moment.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Let’s yeet them into the mist
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What could happen
Bill: I would need to play catch up, I stopped reading Aurii stuff after a while.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybe the mist has pockets where there is none.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There's not much to catch up on lmao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm just trying to think of a way to have other npcs
Bill: The mist was a gradual thing yeah. Wasn't going to consume everything.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Old enemies becoming allies
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also what the mist "does"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): C O N S U M E
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There's the turning people psycho route
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There's the instant death route, there's the filled with a new type of monster route
El🆓de Faun (Tom): No not grimm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But basically grimm
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ye
Bill: It was the psycho route with a hivemind controlling them originally.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That's prob a decent route, maybe the hive mind only controls the strong tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like for example if someone like yuria got controlled it would be direct
El🆓de Faun (Tom): While random villager is too weak
Bill: Mist was multiplanar, so it has destroyed more world before. It carries some beings over into the new dimension with it, and those could be super mist monsters. It also carried over any survivors left on the original world as spirits. Spirits live forever, wander the mist endlessly, and have seen countless worlds get destroyed.
Bill: So they're just a weeeee bit crazy having been around so long, but also HAVE been around so long because they were skilled.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Not a bad idea, then we could technically drift between planes if we wanted to get crazy
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~is this the adventure zone~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Bob Ross voice: let's get crazy what the heck
Bill: Well, if the Mist left aurii it would have ate Aurii.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I can't believe morning mist is destroying aurii
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I thought the same thing~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Again nocs to talk to and classic fantasy setting is a must so I just hope it doesn't get lost in the all consuming mist
El🆓de Faun (Tom): My only concern
Bill: Nah, it'd be more like... BotW? Where there's pockets of civilization that are trying to survive as the mist gets larger and it's influence cuts people off more.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I think that could totally work
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Could also be a quick terrible event initially, like the most errupts in a major city first killing tons of people
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybe Theo is the best epicenter?
Bill: or the Laeran capital...?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): IT COULLLLLD
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Theo is just central but I suppose that doesn't really matter
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also the other nations probably aren't gonna care only the North Western alliance
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Unless because so many nobles are there they will
Bill: See, I'd want Theo to be slowly eaten alive. The city just gets absorbed slowly as people leave for safety or are unwilling to leave their homes.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): At least to send some troops
Bill: send troops to do what.
Bill: Hack at the mist?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Figure out what's up
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybeee
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Inquisitors
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ya know <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): suck the mist up with a fantasy vacuum <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: *Am I going to regret it if I put effort in again*
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~from fantasy costco~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I remember we universally agreed on darker story but like that's all I remember
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The aurii crew gives that mist a S u c c
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Problem solved
Nokri (Marisa): are uh
are we still talking about the cosplayer
El🆓de Faun (Tom): W-what
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:Shooketh_Honda_San:605590718026874901>
Bill: Oh yes, MorningMist is a cosplayer and cause we were talking about *The Mist* the comparison was made.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OHHHHH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I WAS LOST YO
Bill: took me a few.
Nokri (Marisa): Biru mentioned someone named mist earlier in another channel ouo
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): At least Aurii isn't being destroyed by snow <:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Okay now that I understand it's funny as hell
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *were you **not** talking about the cosplayer here?*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh nono was I just forgot!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I thought Marisa was talking about the cosplayer she was editing and I got so confused
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooooh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🎶  Fina can I come over, after schoo-oo-oo-ool, *after school*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **Can we have an Amelia cameo** <@301927856240459777>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Everyone from aurii loves her, a perfect bean
Nokri (Marisa): wow, remember amelia
Nokri (Marisa): u wanna know what would've happened to her?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): To make up for the love she missed out on
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It better be true love and happiness <:lenny:395307171539189760>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Actually she accidentally isekais into aurii
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wooos
Nokri (Marisa): if the story kept going, it could've gone in several ways
i'll type them out
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH ISEKIA
Nokri (Marisa): ISEKAI
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If she dies in story she's reincarnated into aurii <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao she gets hit by a truck
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wow didn't see that coming
Bill: neither did she.
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's like fuuko
El🆓de Faun (Tom): She shows up in aurii makes everything better and leaves
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And we all forget what we saw
Nokri (Marisa): i'm gonna move this write-up to the other channel because it long
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): WOO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): AEMLIA TIME
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybe this channel <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I wasn't sure if he kept it up
Bill: Afina: got over her crippling fear of ~~furries~~ ~~faunus~~ laguz really quick.

Chengu: "The attractive princess..."
Afina: *apparently furry bait*

Tikur: Herald of? the red army? Hail Mother Russia?
Nokri (Marisa): SO some stuff that was planned if this had ever continued:

||Once getting to the communications center, Amelia could've chosen to speak to the person in front of her or behind her in line. If she did, she would've spoken to either a greaser-like mafia guy trying to find his missing sister who is around amelia's age, or a noble exchange student from a foreign country trying to practice their english.

Afterwards, Amelia could choose to stay in the city or leave. If she stays, she could get a job. Her job choices would've been based on various real events and all end in one disaster or another. Like, she could've gotten a job at the factory that makes the clothes she wanted to buy at the department store. That's based off of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire (i think the quest company was called the Square Sweater company or something). She could have gotten a job as a stewardess for tourists on a new dirigible attraction which would have wound up like the one in Kiki's delivery service and eventually turn into the Hindenburg disaster. She could have gotten employed at a company that makes preserves/jam and the machinery would have jammed (haha jam get it) and resembled the Great Molasses Flood of 1910, while also making a fire somehow.

The fire from those events would've spread to the bordering forest where it would endanger Robin and Amelia could choose to go and find/save her. Amelia herself would be saved by the dirty/dusty looking police officer.||
Nokri (Marisa): ||
If Amelia chose to leave the city, she would be invited to an evening ball by Judas in an attempt to get her to stay a few more days. He would be very insistent on her attending because of his arm (which is getting slightly better with physical therapy but will be forever burnt/cursed and will take a long time if it ever gets back to a 'normal' condition), and because local girls would fight over him and cause a scene if they found out he was going dateless. He says there are dresses in the guild's storage and shows them to her in hopes she will attend with him.||
Nokri (Marisa): there's much more, this just has to be broken down into chunks because character limit haha rip
Nokri (Marisa): pls save questions and comments until the end but i definitely wanna hear them if there are any <:mew_face:498866691963355137>
Nokri (Marisa): ||The ball would take place on the night of a new moon, and it was aptly called the New Moon Ball. It happens every month. Judas wanted Amelia to keep quiet about going because if word got out, other girls might bully her into not going with him anymore, defeating the purpose of him asking her in the first place. As they prepare to leave, Judas asks Amelia if she can fetch something for him in a storage shed since it is too much to carry with his lame arm. The shed is almost empty save for a fancy circular carpet out of place on the dirt ground. Amelia could either leave at this point, or search for the item which she won't be able to find. Regardless, Judas would enter. He isn't a cannibal, he just wants to flay her and keep her skin and maybe bathe in her blood for a bit to see if it will heal his arm. It is revealed that Judas also killed the greaser/mafia dude's sister if Amelia happened to meet that guy.

Amelia can perform several actions to get her out, and is saved by the same cop again. Depending on choices she might be badly hurt and spend some time in the hospital.||
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina isn’t over it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): Did I give dusty cop dude a name? I had one for him but did i ever mention it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She just has to be a nice pincess
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Duties come before racism
Nokri (Marisa): I can't remember it, I think it was supposed to be Isaac or something
Nokri (Marisa): I'll go with that
Nokri (Marisa): ||Isaac was Amelia's true romantic interest, in a way. It gets complicated but it's based off the survey everyone filled out at the way beginning. Isaac is a golem who is sort of a puppet for a minor earth god who loved Amelia in a past life. Isaac suspects that Amelia is the one his creator loves based on her birthmarks which he would have seen while rescuing her. (It's based on the native belief that birthmarks are a sign of how one was killed in a past life, and Amelia was beheaded). There are 12 golems total and in their travels Amelia could've accidentally killed or maimed Isaac by making him take a bath or making him travel in heavy rain.

The minor god that loves her could have preformed small miracles for her, and if she kept Isaac alive and showed compassion (since Isaac is pretty deadpan and doesn't have much of a personality aside from "confirm Amelia is The One™ and keep her safe while guiding her to the god's shrine") then Amelia could have used that at some point to repay the favor she owed Robin.||
Nokri (Marisa): uhhHHhh that's all i can remember for now and sylvia is yelling at me so yeah.
Nokri (Marisa): it's a little crazy because there were so many potential paths ;u;
Nokri (Marisa): So that’s what could have been!
||The greaser guy and the foreign noble whose gender I can’t recall would have played more roles if it kept going. Amelia would’ve become more Disney-princess like if she fell in love with the god who loved her, but the god kind of sees Amelia as her past life and not her current one so that would have bothered her. The golems had a name for her (Lia or something like that? I can’t remember) that she thought was just a weird mispronunciation of her name but it’s actually a cutesy waifu nickname in one of the Native American languages||

I gotta find where I wrote stuff down that’d probably help haha rip
a-any thoughts or reactions
Aldus Larian (Jess): I... really wish we had continued this sounds awesome
Nokri (Marisa): Sowwy ;u;
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah is ok! It sounds like a really good story though!
Nokri (Marisa): I’d of ruined it with random overly drawn out descriptions of peasant children and whatnot lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): DOUBT
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YWAH WOO SO GOOD
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I really like the research you did for all this and the world setting was really cool,post apocalypse yet fantasy USA is really neet
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Very unique setting
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i dont know anything else with this feel
Aldus Larian (Jess): mawisa write book!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And yeah she is furry bait although
Bill: ^
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It doesn't help that every single male PC is a furry
Nokri (Marisa): Ye I wanna see more unique settings, a lot of settings get used over and over

There are two stories I wanna write and I started one but I keep going back and erasing it all eyyyy
Bill: true.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The two that weren't going to be: Justins and Jared's yeeted
Nokri (Marisa): Sadly I found there are so few Native American dictionaries online, and what ones do exist are super tiny and lacking
Bill: don't reread it!
Bill: Eliran, technically.
Nokri (Marisa): bUT I keep skipping around
If I don’t reread it how do I know where to go back to <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: But.
Bill: *lol*
Bill: Sylvia will tell you.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Shhhh
Bill: Justin never got past inital concept.
Bill: Jared was GREAT and the nerd needs to come back still.
Bill: ~~Justin is my oldest discord DM apparently~~
Nokri (Marisa): Furries eh
Bill: ~~marisa was going to be a furry until she saw how many furries there already were~~
Nokri (Marisa): I plead the fifth
Bill: fifth, furry, both start with F, furry confirmed.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Understandable
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I mean if there was elves
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There woulda been a chunk of.elves
Bill: are ear fetishes a thing?
Nokri (Marisa): Of course they are
Nokri (Marisa): Haven’t you seen enough anime
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yah I would’ve gone elf
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How bout those dragon people tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): manaketes?
Aldus Larian (Jess): biru said he wouldnt allow more than 1 and nick (i think) pcked it
Bill: I definitely didn't say there was a hard limit on them.
Bill: That wouldn't have been fair.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well u said there were *rare*
Aldus Larian (Jess): and you were upset when one got picked
Bill: Nah, I was worried about Nick minmaxing but that was Nick not the manakete.
Bill: And I wouldn't have made them player race if I had an issue with them.
Aldus Larian (Jess): o.  i got the impression you really didnt want us being one
Bill: Nah.
Nokri (Marisa): everyone become manakete
Bill: I mean, technically Wolf Laguz are pretty rare on the mainland. They're native to Wynne and all.
Bill: So we've already got a strange skew as far as common races lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): if given the choice to not be human, i will not be human
Bill: understandable.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Unless you go to Detroit to become human
Bill: oops this is basically a zombie out break but yolo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow you managed to make Kieron even more unlikable
Bill: He's getting played though.
Bill: He's like a rich dude who gets into fancy drugs. Real useful to have around for his money, but not actually part of the group. (The drugs here are dark magic).
Bill: So they'll drop his ass when he stops being useful.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s also just a weirdo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _hey strangers did you know I’m banging the princess_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina across the room like <:then_perish:554720548274569246>
Bill: He's like 'bitches love when their family home is destroyed by unrestrained dark magic'.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): IM HERE FOR THIS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this looks like a job for POCKET TOMES
Bill: His grand plan is to have Afina as his like, slave leia trophy girl as he becomes the harbringer of dark magic in the underground nobility. Needless to say the people he's working with in the dark magic community are using him for his money and influence to get into Laera's castle. Also needless to say Afrin can take him in a fight.
Bill: Boi is going to have a lot of dreams crushed very quickly.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So he’s like a mid tier villain
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Simply a Spoiled Brat
Bill: He's not the main villain nah. Very midboss.
Bill: I'm feeling a cult of Lyarlel being involved, but they don't realize the mist isn't related to Lyarlel at all?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Alright so who’s probably armed in that room? 🤔 I imagine Afinas mentor but idk who else
Bill: I'm not going to plan anything really. We'll just. do what happens.
Bill: Make shit up.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: sure, why not.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina has a lil something something hidden probably, after the BISHOP INCIDENT who wouldn’t
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is chengus person gonna get mad tanked
Bill: I don't really. remember them.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They were manipulating Che Guevara
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I MEANT CHENGU BUT IM KEEPING THE AUTOCORRECT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So chengu has an excuse to escapé
Bill: We'll worry about that later.
Bill: Bitch either going to die or think Chengu dead.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nicu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I need to think of how to properly address Kieron’s dick-ness
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina is probably a mix of VERY ANGRY because princess but also terrified because _are any fucking knights normal anymore_
Bill: no.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): afina be like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/029/223/cover2.jpg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!184437198865563648> im gonna have to roll dice on kieron or no?
Bill: Nah.
Bill: We’ll keep dice to actual combat.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): alrigHT TIME TO ANNIHILATE THIS TURB
Tikur (Kurtis): I'm definitely missing backstory here 😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kieron?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats afinas dick-ish date
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the mist?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its just dark magics
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it corrupts people and make them crazy it seems
El🆓de Faun (Tom): theres no backstory for this part other that what was written since we restarted
Tikur (Kurtis): Oh okay then 👌
El🆓de Faun (Tom): oh no
El🆓de Faun (Tom): San has death flags
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im almost done writing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "stuffed and mounted like a fox" has found its way in here
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I doubt Chengu would be armed. They more or less selected him to be my dude's sort of protection as a fierce tiger ~~faunus~~ laguz. They might have given him like, a concealed knife or something
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _kitty got claws_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): can i just watch chengu deck someone in the face plz and thank
El🆓de Faun (Tom): we already knOW faun aint transforming
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): elfriede: transforms
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): afina: r u fuckin serious
El🆓de Faun (Tom): everyone: <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 1) Chengu will *absolutely* deck someone in the face (preferably Kieron for ruining the dance he was actually quite enjoying) 
2) I feel like Chengu might actually chase after the two since Kieron was so quick to butt in and usher Afina away. He can tell something's up and this dude is up to no good
3) Chengu may actually transform because I made like a paragraph about my noble telling him not to and then Chengu trying to remember the last time he even *did*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _so now hes gotta_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): okay i got a little thingy started so we can coordinate <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): basically i wrote that afina is like "oh kieron" and then light magic blasts his ass so theres a lotta room for events after that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Especially with the chaos happening, it could be just like a stress trigger that causes him to
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH WOO WE GOT SOME ANIMALS IN HERE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): NICE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYnk01uzkCXDniQrCPkMfYl-RgTyp-InDp-dCR7f8UE/edit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): here what i got so far
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): then afina and chengu could team up to FREE THE PEOPLES
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Question: are laguz still, for lack of better word, *intelligent* in their animal form? Or do they kind of "forget" their humanity?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): nah they intelligent
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean they a little animal-y
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Okie doke
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but theyre kinda animal-y all the time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wasn't sure if it was like a Remus Lupin werewolf transformation type thing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah elfie had an incident where he accidentally showed afina he was a laguz
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~to save her life, she was still a dick about it~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but he was aware that afina wasnt gonna like it like that whole time i believe
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): didnt stop him from ripping a guys throat out tho ahaaaaaa but he was creepy so he deserved it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Damn <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok so you blast him with magic and he's just on his knees like "wtf"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah but who knows what could happen from there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He could be armed <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Wow my gf just blew me... away with magic damn”
Bill: Not were wolves yeah. You can’t talk as an animal tho.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Can you bark and growl? 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause that’s kinda hilarious
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would assume so?
Bill: Well, he’s a tiger so I don’t think he can bark but.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _can tigers bark_
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn wtf did I miss
Bill: It’s the end of the world as we know it~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Already?!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina does _not_ feel fine
Aldus Larian (Jess): so are we under mist control or?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean we could 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afinas gonna FITR
