Bill: *again*
Aldus (Jess): i can, should prob wait for eliran and nokri
Bill: So like, we had before 
```
Elfriede 
Desii does an action specifically aimed at Elfriede, that would spark a mini exchange between them
```
Bill: My thought would be to have it go
Aldus (Jess): i dont remember that
Bill: ```
* Elfriede post
* Desii post
* GM start aside block
* aside.exe
* GM ends aside block
* Aldus posts
```
Bill: (the action is this kiss bullshit)
Bill: This would lock up the table while that aside is open though.
Bill: We'd have to get very good about doing asides quickly again, and doing all posting at midnight post day isn't going to work.
Bill: thoughts.
Afina (Georgia🍀): thought: nah
Afina (Georgia🍀): and elfriede and aldus seem a little tense right now so a smol aside might placate them
Afina (Georgia🍀): idk tho
Aldus (Jess): eliran too tho

Aldus (Jess): yea he got all soft for his ✨ girlfriend ✨
Aldus (Jess): ~~or should i say hard~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~_implied_ hard~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): i should really read the mythology reading on athena cause im finding a lot of (accidental) parallels between athena and afina
