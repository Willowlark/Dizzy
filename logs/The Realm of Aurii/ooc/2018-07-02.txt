Bill: so post day,  think I'm going to skip it as Afina/Desii/Aldus want to aside and Eliran/Elfriede are planning one as well.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> if you want to do something in particular, you were kinda set up for posting on table-4 on your own, though I can setup something for you if you like. Or, you can join one of the other groups.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Soooo wait can we get an official combo for Afina with Desii and Aldus then?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like can you write them bumping into each other and then we can aside?
Bill: Sure, I can do that.
Aldus (Jess): Aldus: in the middle of talking about Afina
Afina walks directly into him
Oh how convenient
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus be like: if I ask the ancestors for a girlfriend will they also give me that
Aldus (Jess): 🙌
