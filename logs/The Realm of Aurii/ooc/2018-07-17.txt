Afina (Georgia🍀): owo?
Nokri (Marisa): did we ever make aurii pokemon trainer cards
i feel like that was maybe a thing
Bill: I had done a card with Desii’s stats. There’s a sight for it.
Bill: I got caught up in photos, forgot about posts.
Nokri (Marisa): final boss desii of the elite 4
Bill: So my image is a plan where Elfriede and Afina let everyone else into the monastery after curfew, and they go to find Enera without permission. I’m just trying to figure how Desii would suggest that plan.
Bill: She not quite morally ambiguous enough.
Nokri (Marisa): [desii voice] "lets break the law"
Aldus (Jess): nokri to the rescue?
Afina (Georgia🍀): "afina-senpai, c-can you let us into the monastery to speak with her ourselves, desu?"
Bill: Nokri, originally Eliran would fit the bill.
Bill: Also if he’s the pragmatic type.
Afina (Georgia🍀): now nokri has to act like a hero cause afrin is there and she thinks shes a good noodle
Bill: After there’s a plan we can cut straight to the execution of it in the evening.
Nokri (Marisa): https://pokecharms.com/trainer-card-maker/
Nokri (Marisa): :3c
Nokri (Marisa): i think there's a better one tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): ok so is it now just a matter of figuring out who suggests what? like whose character says that they should sneak in?
Bill: *priorities Marisa*
Bill: Or if there’s and alternative idea to sneaking in.
Nokri (Marisa): i think nokri still has no idea what's going on, did anyone ever tell her about enera
Eliran (Halim): Eliran is gonna be like 
"Afina just ask if you can talk a fellow genius student???"
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina already asked about the callorian tho, to talk anymore would be SUSPISH
Eliran (Halim): Eliran is also gonna be like
Eliran (Halim): Why did you tell afina
Aldus (Jess): kinda asumed nokri would just know that since they all traveled to trisp for that reason
Eliran (Halim): she's so bad at this kind of stuff
Nokri (Marisa): retcon nokri knew all along <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): ~~afina walks away and nokri pulls out a knife "what's happening"~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): well eliran or elfriede can be like "i walk away for two minutes and youre kidnapping girls???"
Bill: Nokri heard the exposition about Enera.
Bill: I'd like to do something natural while keeping in mind we want to move this story line towards the end.
Bill: Unfortunately I think Desii would try to lurk around to casually bump into Enera and try talking to the bishop everyday.
Afina (Georgia🍀): sooooo afina and elfriede sneak them in..."
Bill: It's viable, just would prefer Desii not the one to come up the idea. Too much GM voice in that.
Bill: Eliran sharing his suspicions now would put a nail in the 'it's just a coincidence' angle I think.
Afina (Georgia🍀): so eliran shouldnt do that?
Bill: Eliran should do what is natural for him to do. In the last few rounds, he's been very clear to Elfie he thinks Eraia is up to something. Combine what happened with Nokri and what Afina found out, you have a suspicious scenario.
Nokri (Marisa): oo we did make trainer cards before. i just found an old nokri one. i think i'd change the pokeymans though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): so eliran thinks eraia is up to something
Afina (Georgia🍀): nokri is suspicious of eraia
Afina (Georgia🍀): and afina is either suspicious or accepting of the circumstances surrounding enera
Afina (Georgia🍀): so someone should post saying that they should go into the monastery to see for themselves
Afina (Georgia🍀): to which desii will agree
Aldus (Jess): Aldi is suspicious as well
Afina (Georgia🍀): and afina will be inclined to agree because letting them into the monastery means that 1) it doesnt make her directly involved, so if it goes wrong she doesnt put callora in jeopardy 2) shes inclined to help a callorian citizen 3) she cares what eliran and his frends think of her
Afina (Georgia🍀): _finally, the conspiracy theorist aldi is revealed_
Aldus (Jess): hence asking if enera is a a common name, if light magic is common in callora and so on
Nokri (Marisa): aurii turns into Mystery Inc. 
~~we already have the talking dogs we just need a van~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): so someone suggest that afina and elfriede let them into the monastery at night
Afina (Georgia🍀): and afina will def agree, and probably offer a plan  because she tactician
Bill: Desii got into an investigative mode. Peeps can start sharing theories and that can spawn the plan.
Nokri (Marisa): ok i finished nokri's new trainer card but it still feels questionable. an improvement, but still can be polished.
Nokri (Marisa): would frillish be unfitting because it looks like royalty or is that exactly the reason nokri would have a frillish 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): #1 priority here we go
Nokri (Marisa): before card
Nokri (Marisa): after card that I may change because that last pokemon is questionable
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): wow i love how it won't load. it's a sign. i shall redo.
Bill: I@m going to sleep.
Nokri (Marisa): *but biru
trainer cards*
Nokri (Marisa): *priorities*
Afina (Georgia🍀): mawisa what pokemans for afrin?
Nokri (Marisa): HMMMM.
it's too bad there's no light pokemon category
Nokri (Marisa): empoleon and jellicent are themed after royalty
Nokri (Marisa): maybe lots of fairies owo
Afina (Georgia🍀): empoleon is bloo too
Nokri (Marisa): MILOTIC
Nokri (Marisa): afina would have a team of legendaries
Afina (Georgia🍀): LMAO
Nokri (Marisa): "yeah this is my shaymin nbd"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "take my reshiram"
Nokri (Marisa): she rides in on a suicune and nokri just dies of shock on the spot
Nokri (Marisa): what about a dragonair? :0
then it evolves into dragonite and she's like "ew you're not blue"
Nokri (Marisa): oo and altaria would be nice
Afina (Georgia🍀): aight i need one more
Nokri (Marisa): ~~something really random~~ the last is always the hardest
Nokri (Marisa): noctowl for wisdom?
Nokri (Marisa): is there a book pokemon
Nokri (Marisa): a slowking she gets really frustrated with
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Nokri (Marisa): OH I SHOULD GIVE NOKRI A MEOWTH because money
omg that noctowl sprite is really funny
nice meowstic 🐱
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): omg she has so many badges
Nokri (Marisa): elite afina
Nokri (Marisa): i really like nokri having a salazzle but maybe that's too cool for her so i replaced salazzle with meowth
Nokri (Marisa): afina doesn't have enough legendaries <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): All legendary team
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I was reading the Aurii Wiki the other day and ERaIaNs are supposed to have dark hair and dull eyes
Afina (Georgia🍀): OmG IT AUTOCORRECTED ERAIANS THAT WAY
Afina (Georgia🍀): anyways yeah and we have caramel hair, amber eyes McGee over here
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think that that description isn't really holding lol
Nokri (Marisa): their eyes are dull because they're fed up with the world
Nokri (Marisa): desii has one of these giant monstrocities
Nokri (Marisa): discord why you do this to my pictures
Afina (Georgia🍀): True facts
Nokri (Marisa): is the picture appearing for you?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri fits Drecans description at least
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah when I click on it
Nokri (Marisa): ooo weird it's all funky for me
Nokri (Marisa): miss "i'm not a drecan" drecan poster child
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tan skin and blonde hair like ok nokri
Afina (Georgia🍀): *touches afina's hair* ***sister?***
Nokri (Marisa): afina gets tanned on the beach before meeting nokri. nokri walks up to her and starts talking in drecan.
Afina (Georgia🍀): trilingual afina when
Afina (Georgia🍀): we need to brainstorm for afina and nokris bffs montage
Nokri (Marisa): laughing while running on the beach, holding hands in slow motion
Afina (Georgia🍀): excellent, i like where youre going with this
Afina (Georgia🍀): i would say we have to plan afinas dark magic arc too but maybe nokri just walks in while afinas trying to teach herself it
Nokri (Marisa): ye!
is it a thing she practices regularly? maybe nokri can suggest they go to the monastery and try to get them in, accidentally bump into afina
Aldus (Jess): afina is going to learn dark magic too?
Nokri (Marisa): is afina's room on the first floor or one of the upper floors
Afina (Georgia🍀): i dont think so
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think its ground level
Afina (Georgia🍀): and ye afinas gonna get angry at light magic for a little bit
Afina (Georgia🍀): tl;dr shes gonna fail hard for the lego reveal and be like FUCK THIS SHIT ITS NOT STRONG
Afina (Georgia🍀): so in her _perilous quest for knowledge and power_ shes gonna try dark magic
Aldus (Jess): o ok
Afina (Georgia🍀): its not a permanent thing tho, im wondering how i can snap afina out of it
Afina (Georgia🍀): but like, afinas so determined to get knowledge and yet hasnt used dark magic yet??? feels like a plot hole
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe afina kills someone again <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): nokri is sneaking around outside, either trying to get info on how they can get inside the monastery, or if it's later she can be gathering plants or something weird that nokri does. she gets a weird feeling from a window and sees hime-sama doin dark majiks. she climbs in through the window and is like "no no you're doing it wrong u gotta *focus* and have like 3 dead people"
Nokri (Marisa): ~~the gang kills someone by accident~~
Nokri (Marisa): bye nokri
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats prob a good idea, afina takes death really seriously
Afina (Georgia🍀): and then when she wallows in her sadness, elfriede busts down the door "hello i heard you crying and i know you hate me for being a furry but I FIX"
Nokri (Marisa): afina uses her newfound powers to accidentally kill elfredo and falls into a deeper despair
Nokri (Marisa): he breaks down the door, nokri is kind of unfazed and covered in blood while afina is screaming bloody murder
Afina (Georgia🍀): is this the plot of romeo and juliet
Nokri (Marisa): have you ever seen anime romeo and juliet?
Afina (Georgia🍀): no 😮
Nokri (Marisa): aw frick i wanted to go to that exhibition. i forgot it was happening it ended last week o well.

there's a manga that's pretty short, only 2 volumes, and the anime.
juliet is a crossdressing superhero and romeo rides a dragon horse
Afina (Georgia🍀): excellent, thats the new plot of aurii
Afina (Georgia🍀): DAMN you know, we never got those wyverns
Nokri (Marisa): also the op is an english song and i internally freaked out at a wedding once because they played this song and i was like *why they playin anime at a wedding*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm1lksPfq5M
Afina (Georgia🍀): i want some of them
Nokri (Marisa): NOKRI USED TO RAISE DRAGONS BIRU GIVE US WYVERNS
Afina (Georgia🍀): DID NOKRI ACTUALLY
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH she always wanted one but instead i think part of her backstory was like, at a wyvern hatching nursery or something where they mass produced 'em for war
Afina (Georgia🍀): NICU
Nokri (Marisa): then she got drafted or somethin
Afina (Georgia🍀): when does afina get armor, that would be the epitome of sexy wouldnt it
Nokri (Marisa): give us a harry potter scenario where someone goes into a bar and comes out drunk with a dragon egg
Nokri (Marisa): would it be bikini armor or like full knight armor
Nokri (Marisa): afina wants knight armor but elfriede misunderstands and buys her bikini armor
Afina (Georgia🍀): _elfriede is this what youre into_
Nokri (Marisa): also in romeo x juliet anime the world is in danger and one of them turns into a tree and the other becomes a farmer
Nokri (Marisa): to save the world
Afina (Georgia🍀): boyfriend hoodies are a thing of the past, boyfriend armor is the hip new thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): afinas becoming a tree now
Nokri (Marisa): elfriede becomes a farmer
"you must be cold afina. take this."
puts armor on the tree
Nokri (Marisa): ~~elfriede's secret bikini armor he wears alone~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): OMG
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina opens the door to elfriedes room, hes standing there in bikini armor
Afina (Georgia🍀): i have dropped a link in nsfw, i think we can make this idea happen
Nokri (Marisa): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): NICE
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah so elfriede has that and afina has his armor
Afina (Georgia🍀): boom charges into battle
Afina (Georgia🍀): i know it makes no sense for afina to have armor as a mage but _it would be rad_
Nokri (Marisa): afina wears it for the aesthetic
the helmet falls over her eyes and she can't see, causing friendly fire
Afina (Georgia🍀): all of the table gets caught in a light beam cause they happened to be standing in a straight line
Afina (Georgia🍀): what skills does nokri have for battle? does she have a weapon?? 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): nokri is more a medic, she'll patch you up in a jiffy when possible.
otherwise she'd be a debuffer, throwing smoke bombs or bottles/potions that would essentially act like mustard gas or impair the enemy in some day.
Nokri (Marisa): basically a salve maker from bravely default, lemme go see what their skills were
Afina (Georgia🍀): so we got a healing mage, two battle mages, two ranged fighters, and a melee fighter
Afina (Georgia🍀): not bad
Aldus (Jess): ~~is that what she's supposed to do?~~
Nokri (Marisa): cures status ailments for allies, causes status ailments for enemies
maybe she could steal weapons and items from fallen enemies
Nokri (Marisa): if she gets a dagger she could use that but not very skilledly
Nokri (Marisa): ~~IF SHE GETS A DRAGON~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh afina had her old dagger before she picked up sword fighting
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina gets mad at elfriede and lets nokri wear and use her sword
Nokri (Marisa): nokri treats it like literal gold
Nokri (Marisa): nokri would totally loot dead or unconscious enemies
Nokri (Marisa): she wanted to in the cave but everyone was like "omg we gotta run" 😛
Afina (Georgia🍀): how rood
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah afinas totally gonna do thta
Afina (Georgia🍀): i gotta brainstorm microaggressions for afina to make towards elfriede
Afina (Georgia🍀): shes gonna be _vindictive_
Nokri (Marisa): nokri goes along with it because she benefits a ton and he's just a servant of the princess so it's totally normal for him to be treated like an afterthought
Nokri (Marisa): "ey princess u want me to talk about how nice you are to me when knight boy is around?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "oh yeah i LOVE DRECANS" afina stares at elfriede the whole time
Afina (Georgia🍀): "nokri lets get platonically married"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "_how about wolf skin rug in our living room nokri"
Nokri (Marisa): "yes your majesty it's perfect, it'll coordinate nicely with the stuffed wolf head over our  expensive obsidian fireplace"
Elfriede (Tom): *Im gone for 2 hours and I come back to Afina in sexy bikini armour*
Nokri (Marisa): fanart of afina in bikini armor laying on a wolfskin rug
Elfriede (Tom): ~~how many moneys~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): were brainstorming how afinas gonna be pity
Afina (Georgia🍀): very vital plot points
Elfriede (Tom): god it feels like a decade since I last posted
Afina (Georgia🍀): well this is... i think the last post before in-game nightfall
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): would bikini armor afina go in nsfw or fanart
asking for  afriend
Afina (Georgia🍀): fanart
Afina (Georgia🍀): becauuuuse we need all the fanart in one place
Elfriede (Tom): Yeeeee
Nokri (Marisa): alfredo is a brown dog ya?
Elfriede (Tom): Yes Alfredo is a brown dog <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): thx
Afina (Georgia🍀): _marisa are you really_
Elfriede (Tom): 🙏 🙏 🙏
Nokri (Marisa): really what <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😏
Nokri (Marisa): it'd be nice if there wasn't a giant glitched tablet popup on my screen
maybe when that's gone i can redraw it better
Nokri (Marisa): ~~afina pin-up calendar: by elfriede~~
