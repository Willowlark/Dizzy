Bill: Yeah a headcanon sealed the deal. His hair will get stiffer or spikier the more charge he has. So when he comes downstairs all spiked up in the dorm after being drained entirely the night before, you know he got up to some *activity* overnight. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Itâ€™s too hilarious not to use. Too many ways he can be teased.
