Aldus Larian (Jess): why is this so hard for me 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): how much time are we saying has passed?
Bill: Half a year.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmm ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): im having a hard time figuring out how aldus whole "recipe for the cure" can factor into his robin hood story thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): some of the things in the recipe seem to be kinda drug like so maybe he gets some kinda back alley shadey connection
Bill: Possibly. Gimme a bit, I have a few ideas but don’t want to type them on phone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): eh?
Bill: How motivated is Aldus for laguz rights as a whole? Not just him but all people.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 🍿
Aldus Larian (Jess): id say he could def be motivated after seeing hoe shitty they are treated in other parts of the world cuz in wynne they treated as equals
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m ready for edgy morally gray Aldus
Bill: I like the idea of a mentor, NPC contact for the group (dagger guy). Rather than Etrina, I think you should use Torshan. Make the group radical cat laguz, who are tired of the oppressive nature they have in Torshan. Aldus is altruistic enough to support them even being a wolf. It makes him valuable too, because no one would expect a wolf in the gang of cats.
Bill: You could either get an invitation to go to the party from Afina or straight up sneak in, I'm even partial to the latter.
Aldus Larian (Jess): who said its a guy <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *Oh man another bad ass girl*
Bill: Yes please.
Aldus Larian (Jess): who said it's a girl <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760> 🍿🍿🍿
Bill: the fuck is with the popcorn.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is entertaining to watch
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes hungry!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The suspense is killing me
Bill: ,... I get the feeling you two are up to something and I'm decidedly *not* in the mood for it if you are.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I am not a part of this lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i literally am just making a gender neutral NPC
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ah so "they cool" was not multiple people saving Aldus... twas a singular "they"
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye!
Aldus Larian (Jess): one (1) dagger person
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): one (1) dagger person with two (2) daggers
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): they will be attractive
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you know what that that avatar creator has?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🍿 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): NINJA SAVIOR
Aldus Larian (Jess): bless
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's just to show the knives, not an artist's rendering of the character. I will let Jess make them hot
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ninja Aurii chibi bit when
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was considering black hair so good call XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lowkey was considering adding those knives to Chengu lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): theyre actually a leopard laguz ~~its just vanderwood~~
Bill: ...Yeah I still feel like the butt of some kind of joke.
Aldus Larian (Jess): not at all?
Aldus Larian (Jess): im assuming erik popcorned because he thought it was interesting ~~i hope~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I was~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like seeing peeps post about their characters because it's inspiring
N🆗ri (Marisa): i popcorned because i was also reading for entertainment because it was an interesting disuccsion
N🆗ri (Marisa): and copycatting erik
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I support androgynous NPC that’d be rad
N🆗ri (Marisa): did the popcorn come off as mocking somehow?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or was it the lenny face <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Alright. I must have read it wrong. Been feeling... unappreciated? That’s not the word... secondary, unimportant, outsider Idk the wording but it tinted my reading. Idk.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think its in your head fam
N🆗ri (Marisa): you're the head honcho, the server revolves around aurii and your creations, you're literally the most important one here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah whatever you misconstrued as mocking is just enthusiasm for the details of da game
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): chibi was a mistake
Bill: The game thing is just the catalyst...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): catalyst?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!184437198865563648>  bill u cant just "gotta go fast" outta here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): unless yore sleeping but then at least do the favor of telling us youre sleeping
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 🎵 clear communication with friends is important 🎵
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): we'll grill you in the morning bill <:thenflourish:564838295108976680>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): stupid aurii chibi making me wanna write
N🆗ri (Marisa): you know you wanna
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i have infinity possibilities at writing interim scenes for afrin...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and bill said i should develop a hobby for her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She should take up writing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): def should take up writing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that is _too convenient_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i still have that dark arts afrin somewhere in the backburner
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she started asking protips from nokri on dark magic, because The Eraia Incident made light seem like bad magic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho id be interested in developing the skills she has as a noble, especially with bills comment on callorians respecting horseback riders, and afina scoffing at the soldiers in Season 1 telling them she knew what she was doing with a horse
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): aha i found that little nugget of foreshadowing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "Afina looked up at the horses. Sharing a horse? How antiquated. Elfriede looked at her, head cocked, indicating that the decision was clearly up to her. Afina pursed her lips and walked forward, positioning one foot in the stirrup to hoist herself up onto the saddle."
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i only have the first couple months of table two saved oof
Elfriede Faun (Tom): oof
Elfriede Faun (Tom): but they are somewhere!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): good shit
N🆗ri (Marisa): What if nokri’s massive ego from chibi became the antagonist of guardians of the galaxy 2
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I definitely wanna redraw Elfriede and his outfit for this season cuz I have some design changes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@184437198865563648> if it's alright with you when we do run, I'd like to add some flavor text for San here and there, not like all the time just once in a while if the situation calls for it.
Bill: It's fine, we'll talk labout logistics of it, I just don't want you playing two characters but adding flavor should be fine.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I def don't wanna play her
