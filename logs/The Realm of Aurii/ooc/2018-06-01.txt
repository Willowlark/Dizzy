Bill: Still haven’t read posts, but probably.
Eliran (Halim): why mages are bad at close up conflict 101: 
Grab cast hand, Smack book away since holding an open tome securely in one hand is improbably at best.
Nokri (Marisa): eliran is going OwO
Eliran (Halim): Eliran atm: OwO whats this, a Tyndal??
Eliran (Halim): sidenote: Idk if afrin was a canon nickname already
Eliran (Halim): But if it wasn't

Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!351785752197201920> is elfie helping aldus and nokri cause hes a Good Boi™ ~~that no longer scoffs at beggars~~ now or just cause they remind him of afina and atalantia
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: hmm maybe a little bit of both
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeah a bit of both
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: if there wasnt that connection i wouldve taken a different route
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: theres also the fact that shes drecan
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: soooo elfriede not only figures he can help them by bringing her back but also find out some info
Aldus (Jess): He changed his too very fast lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina influenced him to be a good boi, hes v emotionally fragile and soft now
Eliran (Halim): is it lylalel or
Eliran (Halim): what is the god person
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lylalel yw
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~hes emotionally soft now which will make crushing him later so much worse oof~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: oo he can go back to being an asshole woo <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): wooooo character regression
Afina (Georgia🍀): ya but afina has to become more open minded as a result.... ~~right?? **right***??~~
Nokri (Marisa): were elf and ald and nok going to aside or are we waiting for next post day?
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: Eraian military? More like religious cuckoos '
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina: gets needlessly defensive over Elfriede
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran: IMMEDIATELY SUSPICIOUS
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: -squints eyes- you either are becoming religious... or you wanna fuck the boi
Eliran (Halim): i like how afina "lets him off" 
Like she has actual power over him
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: did elrian think Jesus christ >w>
Eliran (Halim): Yeah
I used it cause I don't have an inworld equivalent
Aldus (Jess): I think we are waiting? I think?
Eliran (Halim): especially since lylalel is very eraian and not a widespread culture god to swear to unlike jesus christ in the US
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran: would the Afina I know change her world view to accept a radical ideology...... or want the booty hm
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
