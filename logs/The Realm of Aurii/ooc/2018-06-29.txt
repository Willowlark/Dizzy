Aldus (Jess): OO <@!301927856240459777>  i wans gonna bring aside to an end if dat ok? prob in the morning? like ill have him get awkward and be like "ok imma go now" but better than that and then you can do like little wrap up after that?
Nokri (Marisa): Ye das fine <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): “Thanks. Bye.” Just gets up and leaves.
Aldus (Jess): "thanks for the bad touch imma go now"
Nokri (Marisa): nokri's like "i did a great job cheering someone up. i'm awesome. i should open a consultation service to cheer people up."
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~she better, afinas gonna be there soon~~
Elfriede (Tom): Ya know... I kinda think that Eliran taking Elfriede out for a night of drinking and bringing him back. To the squad drunk should be canon at some point
Eliran (Halim): -looks at table 2- 
Well they both got nothing to do
Aldus (Jess): that could actually play into the lego reveal but i know you guy have that on lock down
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao I would if that night wasn't so important
Elfriede (Tom): But after
Elfriede (Tom): 👌 👌 👌
Aldus (Jess): is eliran gonna be mad at him tho?
Eliran (Halim): Probably not
Elfriede (Tom): I kinda doubt it, maybe a bit since he liked to the princess but
Elfriede (Tom): Lied
Aldus (Jess): he didnt lie he just didnt tell the truth
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Eliran (Halim): Lie of omission is still a lie
Eliran (Halim): Eliran will probably be super sympathetic and comfort Afina
Eliran (Halim): But he also wouldn't blame elfriede for hiding his ~~faunus~~ traits
Aldus (Jess): i thought that said his fursona
Eliran (Halim): That too
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao, his fursonas name is dredge the furry warlock
Eliran (Halim): Heck 
Eliran might be one of the people trying to smooth things out between the two
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah.. most likely
Aldus (Jess): only because the others dont know them 😦
Aldus (Jess): ~~thats why i suggested waiting till the other characters got to know them a tiny bit~~
Bill: Which I am more than game for, so.
Bill: They're assuming the reveal is tonight in game, I never said so. 😛
Elfriede (Tom): If it's not well, let's get Elfriede drunk
Eliran (Halim): Yes
Eliran (Halim): Elfriede tis kinda quiet about enera
Eliran (Halim): Eliran like _but what if I get him drunk more details_
Eliran (Halim): Instead winds up with a drunk boi lamenting about his relationship problems
Eliran (Halim): Elfriede keeps almost telling eliran what he cant tell afina but remembers at the last second he cant tell eliran either
Elfriede (Tom): Drunk Elfriede is a completely different character in lore
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede with the power of 2 ciders summons *Drunk Elfriede* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): well if its not then you have to plan that silly
Aldus (Jess): also soes elfriede know about enera ~~aldus wanna come too~~ whoops
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah he knows where she is
Eliran (Halim): Bros get turnt Eraian style yes?
Eliran (Halim): #guysnightout?
Aldus (Jess): 🙌
Aldus (Jess): isnt getting turnt erain style like going to church or smth tho
Eliran (Halim): Shhhhh
Eliran (Halim): Its actually Eblian style but we cant let the Eraians know that
Aldus (Jess): WHOO!
Elfriede (Tom): But Elfriede promised to tell Afina tonight 🤔
Aldus (Jess): well damnit elfriede
Aldus (Jess): "imma a lego ok by imma go get drunk"
Elfriede (Tom): Ya know something I hadn't considered
Elfriede (Tom): When Afina raked her fingers through his hair to grab it during their *activity*. She *might* have possibly felt the scar bumps for the ears
Aldus (Jess): maybe she went straight up hes head right in the middle
Elfriede (Tom): Or I guess the back of his head would have worked
Elfriede (Tom): That's prob the more likely spot she grabbed
Elfriede (Tom): Crisis averted
Aldus (Jess): "oh elfy what strange scars you have"
"oh elfy, what a bog tail you have"
Aldus (Jess): <@!301927856240459777>  did nokri touch aldis tummy? or just kinda gawked
Nokri (Marisa): henlo

Aldus (Jess): UH OH
Nokri (Marisa): pg13
Elfriede (Tom): TOUCH THE TUM

Aldus (Jess): LMAO
Aldus (Jess): because he wants to go or because he didnt tell her about the scar
Nokri (Marisa): yeah
Aldus (Jess): ~~what dis girl want a sleep over?~~
Aldus (Jess): they can stay up all night and do each others nails
Nokri (Marisa): nokri starts peeling off his nails
"oh, you mean, attached?"
Aldus (Jess): PLZ
Aldus (Jess): ~~nokri should find a big ol soft spot for everyone~~
Aldus (Jess): what who said that
Aldus (Jess): Nokri: "The Moon is Lovely Tonight"
Aldus: "Yea? I guess? What does that matter?"
Elfriede (Tom): So hear me out
Elfriede (Tom): Change the eye color
Elfriede (Tom): Older Elfriede
Aldus (Jess): 👀
