Bill: This is going to be a week.
Bill: The lego reveal will be this week. Most likely, the mystery around Enera will be solved.
Bill: Assuming everyone is actually at the monastery tonight (namely those who haven’t posted yet), expect asiding this week <@!351471675843411978> <@!288513265661902858> <@!301927856240459777>, with Enera herself.
Dizzy: GM posts come out today.
Aldus (Jess): ok so whats going on? we're all gathering at eneras door? afinas getting creeped on by the bishop and elfriede is? looking for afina?
Bill: Elfriede is letting the people who aren't staying the monastery in the door after hours. The plan is to go to Enera's room all sneaky like.
Aldus (Jess): 5 people?
Bill: Pretty much. Afina didn't show up though, so Elfriede is going to run off to find her.
Bill: So it's more going to be Desii/Aldus/Nokri/Eliran.
Aldus (Jess): ~~and then go ghost i mean wolf~~
Aldus (Jess): mmm ok
Bill: you don't have to do that, but plot.
Aldus (Jess): im just going along with the flow at this point
Aldus (Jess): so im writing aldus standing at the door? like the outside door, or eneras door?
Bill: Desii's post was her thoughts as they headed there, then waiting for Elfirede to open the door, which he did. You can either stick to the Desii timeline in reply assuming Elfriede's post already happened.
Bill: Doesn't matter.
Bill: Next round is heading to Enera's room.
Nokri (Marisa): Slumber party
Elfriede (Tom): Oh Elfriede needs to be disarmed I guess
Nokri (Marisa): nokri whacks the weapon out of his hand
"whatcha gonna do about it? huh? tell the princess? pathetic."
Elfriede (Tom): Lmaodamn
Aldus (Jess): can i just assume the Eliran informed aldus of the elfy afina relationship?
Nokri (Marisa): everyone's nervous and nokri's just like "lol chill out"
comic relief
Nokri (Marisa): really really bad comic relief
Eliran (Halim): Hol up 
I have a post it's just on my computer
I can post around 4?
Bill: Yeah, I'm not posting till after 5.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _billiam_, can I get some more lore on how pervasive magic is in Aurii
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like are there magical items
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or is everything just come from tomes
Bill: No magic items.
Bill: There's ritual magic, which is hour long casting, drawing circles, very sciencey.
Bill: Tomes, for reasons unexplained, circumvent that process with their weird script.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nothing to boost ability?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Are there people that try to scam magical items
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like "ah yes these gloves boost light magic I swear"
Bill: Probably? Anyone worth their salt would know its a scam tho.
Aldus (Jess): ~~sounds like something nokri would try to sell~~
Bill: It's like... those 'magic' weight loss pills, that kind of thing.
Bill: I love Aldus snooping into Knight Light via scent.
Bill: It's going to give him a real good basis to talk about they're relationship later ('i could *smell* how close you two were to each other')
Aldus (Jess): he sniff
Aldus (Jess): afinas gonna be like "what the fuck"
Bill: "You had a tail AND you were cheating on me?!"

"I just had a tail!"

"That's worse!"
Eliran (Halim): considering light magic is v faith based
Eliran (Halim): placebo effect gloves would actually be very effective
Bill: Hal, if Eliran would not go along with the plan in character he doesn't have to.
Bill: in case you're doing 'begrudging accomplice' as a way to keep involved without breaking character.
Eliran (Halim): I am 
I also can't really have Eliran not go because of the fact the plan is something Eliran finds distasteful and threatening to one he would consider family 
Like its either he goes along with it, or he'd actively put a stop to it
Bill: "I'm going along to clean up the mess I know this is going to make"
Eliran (Halim): p much
Bill: that works though.
Eliran (Halim): ~~eliran is going to lecture everyone after the fact~~
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede is the same tbh
Bill: It's moot here because we're also trying to wrap up Trisp, but in the future be sure to show *in character* dissention like this. It's great aside fodder.
Eliran (Halim): Elfriede and Eliran become bros over how dangerous and stupid there friends plans can be
Elfriede (Tom): Maybe Eliran thinks the tail is hawt <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~No one thinks it's hot Elfriede, put it away~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I appreciate snooping Aldus too lmao
Bill: Georgia, can you drop the last part of your post?
Bill: I want to go about it a different way.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aye aye
Afina (Georgia🍀): Done
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmm Aurii gettin spicyyyy
Elfriede (Tom): 🙌 🙌 🙌
Bill: I was going to try and push the reveal to thursday, but nahhhhh, too good.
Bill: Aside can roll right out of the head-table.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOO PARTY TIME
Bill: *where in any of that is a party*
Aldus (Jess): ~~head table who? I don't know her~~
Bill: You’re right, I should delete the server.
Aldus (Jess): Yo rip who brainwashed this child
Elfriede (Tom): **good posts** everyone i just caught up on pm everyones
Bill: Yea, it was a good round for each of you.
