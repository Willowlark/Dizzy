Bill: @everyone  - As mentioned in other chats I want to try my hand at a BNHA themed one shot. Before you ask "*What about Aurii?!?!!"*, I'm going to run the One Shot in *Fate Accelerated (FAE)*. Currently Aurii's mechanics (dice rolling, character sheets) are a mash up of the original system *Wushu* and FAE. I didn't want to pull away from Wushu originally, but in thinking about it the best parts of the system seem to come from FAE. 

I've never run FAE and though it's a light weight system (less than 10 pages for characters and rules respectively) I'm not willing to move Aurii any further over to that ruleset until I have some experience. SOOOOooooo... BNHA oneshot in FAE.
Bill: * This game will be *live*, on a video call at some point. 
* The character sheet will be identical to Aurii's, Aspects and Approaches. You will also be able to make a   *stunt*, which is effectively a mad lib and easily done.
* I'm not going to both explaining rules, mechanics, etc. I'll give you a link to the book if you'd like to read yourself, but it's such a simple system I'd rather have you all focus on the *Theatre of the Mind* concept (IE: imagination and doing whatever the hell you want, I'll figure out how to make it work for rules). 
* If you don't want to come up with an original character, I don't really mind if you play an Expy of a canon character (so long as they aren't one of the broken ones *cough Deku Bakugou Todoroki cough*. If you want to experience the new game system but not actually try to make a character, you can just play ~~M~~Nina or D~~e~~anki.  
* This game is in *the setting, not the series*. None of class 1-A canonically exists. All Might does, but he's only there as the "pillar of justice" IE, not your friend. 
* Speaking of Canon, if you have holes in the canon knowledge, *that's fine!* Caught up on manga, anime, or neither, only read fanfic, never heard of BNHA, I don't care. All you really need to know is superhero high school. (Anime Sky High).

Bill: @everyone Character Creation is available in <#504420918253191178>. (If only Aurii's instructions were that clear at the start.)
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> you can use @ Questers for @'ing all players in Quest.
