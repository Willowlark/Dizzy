Nokri (Marisa): Nokri has finally been banished to her own table

Eliran (Halim): Tom u wanna start aside
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yea, just gotta do a setup post and stuff
Nokri (Marisa): jess if u want to aside at all I’m also present for a bit
Aldus (Jess): Ye! Did you have idea of what you'd like to talk about? Desii post says she doesn't come down until mid morning so I could have Aldus chilling downstairs wait for her and Nokri could come down and talk to him
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: i gotta do some thinking as to what i want elfriedes morning to be tho so it might take me a bit
Nokri (Marisa): o i was gonna have it be from the night before still but we can do a morning aside if it's too late for that
Nokri (Marisa): nokri tries to leave the building "what r u doin punk"
Aldus (Jess): Whatever works! The most important thing is to have a topic I'd say
Nokri (Marisa): today's topic is tsundere
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: whos the tsuna nd whos the dere <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): what aside channel isn't being used right now. where do alfredo and eliran want to set up
Eliran (Halim): I was gonna say corresponding table to aside
Bill: That’d be fine.
Aldus (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  so this is right after? Eliran/Aldus aside?
Nokri (Marisa): ye if that works for you
Nokri (Marisa): ~~nokri joins aldus standing over eliran and watching him sleep~~
Aldus (Jess): Ye that's fine! Should Aldi come out in the hall?
Aldus (Jess): Originally they were all supposed to have their own rooms so maybe I'll just have him come out to go back to his room?
Nokri (Marisa): o was he gonna bunk with eli? I can have nokri go into the hall if that's the case
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: this is why I didnt tell you guys who I was
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: there i did Elfreides setup post <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus (Jess): So where is she right now? In the hall?
Nokri (Marisa): she's in her room with her head stickin' out into the hall like a creep
Aldus (Jess): Oh ok perfect
Nokri (Marisa): nokri's diary has like. super detailed sketches of eli and aldi sleeping and notes on how their posture is gonna give them back issues
Nokri (Marisa): (ahh sorry my browser crashed as i was submitting my final papers, i'll get to the aside in a bit but i gotta leave soon anyway)
Aldus (Jess): That's ok we can continue in the morning (my morning)👌
Nokri (Marisa): go sweep fwnd

Afina (Georgia🍀): 😮
Nokri (Marisa): nokri takes out a clipboard and adjusts her therapist glasses "how does that make you *feel*"
also does aldus have any non-emotional/psychological injuries atm
since this is a chance for nokri to actually not be horrible she can offer to help if so. if not maybe like. a drink idk she'll poof money from somewhere. she gonna try to attempt to improve aldi's mood
Aldus (Jess): ummmm i guess he could have injuries from the cave fight still, probably healed over, but not looking good just yet?
Aldus (Jess): "but it would suck if his sour mood continued and dragged everyone else down." damnit nokri
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): gee wouldn't want anyone dragging the group down eh
Nokri (Marisa): u don't have to make up injuries it ok
Aldus (Jess): ~~she could serve upa big ol helping of apologies ~~
Aldus (Jess): who said hta
Nokri (Marisa): she doesn't think she did anything wrong so she doesn't know what to apologize for <:lenny:395307171539189760>
her mood atm is light enough that she might get snappy if she doesn't understand but she isn't gonna purposefully escalate a situation and *might even apologize maybe omg*
Aldus (Jess): *steals aldus a drink* "lets talk about it"
Nokri (Marisa): she isn't a thief omg she's a scoundrel but not a thief
she'd do puppy dog eyes until someone bought her a drink and then ditch them
Aldus (Jess): *flirts with some guy till he buys her a drink* "ok now get lost!" *slides drink to aldus*
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH exactly!!

Aldus (Jess): lets do it
Nokri (Marisa): do i have to roll for that to see if it's successful
Aldus (Jess): i dont think so
Nokri (Marisa): what if she was mixin' up potions in the hotel room and one happened to be fermented
Aldus (Jess): aldus might be a little weary of any homemade nokri brew
Eliran (Halim): Gonna make post in a bit then aside can get rolling
Nokri (Marisa): Now why would he be weary <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus (Jess) ♊: there so broad
Afina (Georgia🍀): My mom said my personality was type A just last night

Aldus (Jess) ♊: lol well the other 2 get forgot then
Afina (Georgia🍀): Alpha blood owo 💪💉
Aldus (Jess) ♊: you have AB blood though
Afina (Georgia🍀): Do I?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idek
Bill: Jess, apparently knows Georgia's blood type.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Justin needed me to volunteer for him to take my blood but he said they won't even test it
Aldus (Jess) ♊: she just said it!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Jess: scans body "boom AB"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no my DAD is AB
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I assumed I would be AB
Afina (Georgia🍀): But genetics you said means I'm A or B

Bill: `[11:57 AM] Afina (Georgia🍀): My parents forGOT`
Aldus (Jess) ♊: DUH lmao
Aldus (Jess) ♊: sorry
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~how do your parents forget such vital info, what if I need a blood transfusion someday~~
Aldus (Jess) ♊: also if you get pregers and your baby doesnt have a compatably blood type it can cuse issues
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😮
Afina (Georgia🍀): Another reason not to get pregananant
Bill: It's on your medical records.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: thats why its good to know before hand your blood type and the fathers to determine weather or not itll be a risk
Aldus (Jess) ♊: not always
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~I have medical records?~~
Bill: at a hospital? Yeah.
Bill: Everyone call your GP.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The only time I was a hospital patient was when I was born, do they still have those 🤔
Bill: good question.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: GP?
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: ye, all hospitals usually keep birth records
Aldus (Jess) ♊: general physician?
Bill: yeah.
Bill: GP should know.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: dont have one whoops
Aldus (Jess) ♊: i havent been to a doctor in like 6 years?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I thought that said "call your GF"
Bill: oO
Aldus (Jess) ♊: i need a new one
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~I was about to be like Hal is the only one here with a GF~~
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: if u get blood drawn they don't tell you your blood type it's baloney
Afina (Georgia🍀): THEYVE STOLEN MY BLOOD LIKE A BILLION TIMES AND i still don't know what type I have it's bullshit
Aldus (Jess) ♊: i havent had blood drawn as far as i can remeber
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: i was in the hospital last year and they drew my blood a few times and i scoured the paperwork, no blood type. nonsense.
Bill: *Thanks for the reminder*
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: i think you have to specially request a thing be done but you can buy blood tests online
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: we did it in high school
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: not on ourselves on samples
Afina (Georgia🍀): _Bill I mean that everyone is either married or has a boyfriend or is single, it's weird to think that only Hal technically had a girlfriend, don't forget we're all getting group married anyways so it's okay_
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: o i was thinking of ship names today in class did u and biru decide on one
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah it's okay
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: model relationship isn't good but what about a picture perfect relationship
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Okay so these symbols are actually starting to wierd me out
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🤔

Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: i still think someone should use sophistigaytion too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Who's sophistigayted
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause hal and tom are already cherry blossom boudoir
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: biru/hal? biru wore a suit once right
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cherry blossom boudoir is like the real life equivalent of knight light, as in that that ship is the most cleverly named
Elfriede (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: y'all come do a photoshoot here the studio has a ton of cherry blossoms and petals
Eliran (Halim): georgia I thought you said your mom had an 0 blood type
Afina (Georgia🍀): My mom is O yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): My dad is AB
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: o yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): O is recessive
Eliran (Halim): then you should be A/B with recessive 0
Elfriede (Tom): 0 is too powerful
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: things getting heated in the blood type fandom
Aldus (Jess) ♊: unless you've had blood work, or they did a test a birth it may not be in your medical records
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh wait I forgot that we borrowed a lot of ship names for real life us with cosplay/play by post us whoops
Elfriede (Tom): Oops
Afina (Georgia🍀): I've had blood work but that's through the blood people not a hospital

Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani what you mean
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like things that are canon
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~Jess and me have a ship name, that means we're canon, who's gonna tell tom~~
Aldus (Jess) ♊: 😘
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: ~~ship name couple cosplay~~

Afina (Georgia🍀): As most of us...... cosplay

Elfriede (Tom): This conversation is too fast I can't keep up

Afina (Georgia🍀): Smashing right through those Rutgers requirements I am
Bill: that so Yoda?
Afina (Georgia🍀): My dad: "yeah no I never knew your blood type"
Aldus (Jess): <@!184437198865563648>  should we have an aside with the mean bishop man?
Bill: Desii is going to back down, I'd say you should make a post that brings Aldus in to the conversation (he could hear everything due to his special ears) and that can setup an aside.
Aldus (Jess): aldus is upper afraid of pissing anyone off in this scary eraia town so he'd probably not want to stand up to meany mc butt man
Aldus (Jess): would maybe suggest finding Elfriede or Afina?
Bill: So asiding next round after backing down would be better.
Aldus (Jess): yea probably
Aldus (Jess): i mean he might ask him again politly but he isnt gonna like pull him over the desk by his meancybutt robe and demand he see enera
Bill: then do that this round. If you can't tell, they aren't big on the idea.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~That'd be hawt damn Aldus~~
Aldus (Jess): yea but it would proabbly end really badly for him ~~but yea it'd be sexy af~~
Bill: I dunno what would happen with that.
Aldus (Jess): bad things
Aldus (Jess): also it wouldn't be in character  at this point
Bill: I dunno.
Bill: which is the important part.
Aldus (Jess): he super weary of eraia
Aldus (Jess): after elfy was so suspicious over nothing aldus is like "oh shit"
Aldus (Jess): what info do we have on enera anyway? she was kidnapped and now they think she is here but do they know anything else besides that?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina SAW her
Elfriede (Tom): Wait what's hawt lmao
Aldus (Jess): aldus taking charge
Elfriede (Tom): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): but hed prob just end up in jail
Aldus (Jess): oo what did afina see?
Aldus (Jess): i missed some stuff somehow many rounds ago
Bill: Afina basically just saw Enera in a doorway. The name has been mentioned in the monastery.
Bill: ```
[7:07 AM] Bill: "Wow, um, that's quite a generous offer." Desii says, nervously twisting her right foot against the floorboards. "I uh, well, you saw this morning that I have to worry about being followed by Zaimar, so I'd really just cause you more trouble." She says. She doesn't sound convinced by her own justification. She glances over to the bartender and takes a deep breath, that nervous energy flowing from her.

"I am going to Trisp though. I can help you find Crysalin too, if you help me with something else." she says somberly. The bartender walks into the back, almost as if on cue. "The bartender here, and his wife... I helped them out in the attack the other night. They showed me some hospitality, and they also told me their story."

"There have been plenty of attacks on this town in the past. The mountains are right there, and it is a border town. Eraia and Callora aren't usually at blows, but there are those with negative opinions of the other on either side. None to this level, the city watch here is quite skilled." Desii lays her hands on top of each other on the table, the upper one holding the lower. "During an attack years ago Dain and Saila lost their daughter. It was a violent attack and she was shopping near the point of attack."

"Dain and Saila don't think she was killed though. They, as any parent would, dove into the attacking force desperately trying to find their daughter. They swear the saw a man with Eraian regalia carrying Enera off. No one in town believes them. The whole town things Dain and Saila are just clinging to any fanciful story they can, rather than accept Enera's death." Desii says quietly. You can see in her eyes that she believe Dain and Saila.```
Bill: ```[7:08 AM] Bill: "It makes sense, if only for one detail. Enera was a studying light mage. She was self taught but was doing wonderfully, from what I can tell. She was young enough at the time that if she was taken away, she could be convinced everything was fine." Desii finishes. "I said I'd look for her when I go into Eraia. Dain and Saila can't get across the border, but I was going to find a way somehow to begin with. If you help me look for her in Trisp, I'd be able to help you find Crysalin." Desii's eyes are passionate, you can see how much she's taken to this quest. She looks back and forth between you, pressuring you to answer with that same passion. 
```
Aldus (Jess): ok yea i remember most of that
Aldus (Jess): need to find the part with afina
Bill: table-2, search the name.
Aldus (Jess): ok so its jsut that littel bit about the doog
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah so Afina knows what enera looks like
Afina (Georgia🍀): And that the bishop rebuked enera pretty harshly
Elfriede (Tom): BEGONE
Bill: *She's fourteen*
Aldus (Jess): Ok so
Aldus (Jess): Aurii conspiracy theory coming up
Aldus (Jess): It's not normal for eraia to take in students from other countries right?
Aldus (Jess): And they think might magic is layallalalala's blessing right?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee?
Aldus (Jess): So
Aldus (Jess): They are kidnapping light mages for something
Aldus (Jess): They're going to try to get Afina to stay there just like enera
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hmmm would they be stupid enough to do that to a public figure of another nation?
Aldus (Jess): Maybe
Aldus (Jess): Something is up there tho
Bill: Wow.
Bill: That's a good theory.
Aldus (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus (Jess): But also 👀 👀 👀 👀
Aldus (Jess): Maybe eraia is going to try to use Afina as a bargaining chip against callora to get then to fight dreca
Bill: that's an appropriate response.
Aldus (Jess): 👀👀👀👀👀👀
Aldus (Jess): We asked for more political intrigue
Afina (Georgia🍀): It would cause a pretty big uproar in callora
Afina (Georgia🍀): Laera would be furious
Aldus (Jess): Exactly
Afina (Georgia🍀): And the other nations would be like "oh that's achelous' daughter"
Bill: I didn't mean to the bargaining chip, but...
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aldus (Jess): Ah ok
Aldus (Jess): Still though 👀
Bill: you never knowwwww
Aldus (Jess): ~~i figured out aurii~~
Aldus (Jess): Wait wasn't afaina going to teach desii light magic?
Bill: especially since Afina has been out of the political game due to her ~~studies~~ banishment to Trisp.
Aldus (Jess): And desiis all "yeet I'm great at everything"
Bill: who knows what's going on.
Aldus (Jess): Tell us the secrets!
Bill: Find them out yourselves.
Aldus (Jess): 👀
Afina (Georgia🍀): Conspiracy Theorist Aldus
Aldus (Jess): Dude he's gonna tell everyone his theory at some point nd everyone's just gonna be like "that's ridiculous get out of here"
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede (Tom): Yeass
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus knows afina's a light mage yeah?
Aldus (Jess): nope
Aldus (Jess): unless she mentioned it at diner
Aldus (Jess): I dont think desii mentioned it to him?
Aldus (Jess): for sake of ease we could just go with that is was mentioned at dinner?
Aldus (Jess): cant wait for elfriede loyalty to be tested
Bill: now that is going to be fun, yes.
Aldus (Jess): plot twist dreca was the good guis the whole time
Aldus (Jess): more likley they are both fucked up and neither is good
Bill: ding dong.
Bill: almost.
Bill: Both isn't quite correct.
Aldus (Jess): where do the dragons come in?
Bill: Manakete?
Bill: or real dergs?
Aldus (Jess): na
Aldus (Jess): lalalala and larararara
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wyverns?
Aldus (Jess): no the good and evil dragons
Aldus (Jess): wait so can we go with aldus knows afinas a light mage?
Bill: Lylalel is a dragon?
Bill: ~~Did I write that?~~
Aldus (Jess): isk did you? maybe im messing it up with fire emblem
Bill: ~~I have no idea~~
Aldus (Jess): yea wait i think you did
Aldus (Jess): cuz when that guy we had who was a manakete was here you had him captured, i thought it was becuase he was fake dragon god?
Aldus (Jess): shit isk wheres the world guide pinned again?
Bill: Ah, na, the Eraians just consider any monster to be a servant of Lyarlel.
Aldus (Jess): oooooo ok
Bill: you can literally go to aurii.us
Aldus (Jess): oh neat
Bill: I bought the domain.
Afina (Georgia🍀): We should have Aldus know that Afina is a light mage
Aldus (Jess): "Lylalel is portrayed as a woman in white, beautiful with golden hair and eyes as deep blue as sapphire."
Afina (Georgia🍀): Desii probably mentioned it at some point
Aldus (Jess): THEY THING AFINA IS LYLELELELEL
Aldus (Jess): ~~so does elfy~~
Bill: So when I say deep blue, I mean like, *deep* blue.
Bill: Almanacs are things I forgot about. I wonder if they can get roped in again...
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's why they didn't diddly, cause elfie thinks Afina is actually lololol
Afina (Georgia🍀): conspiracy theoriesssss
Aldus (Jess): yea i mean im seeing some stuff here
Aldus (Jess): ~~if my theory is in the right direction~~
Bill: from the alamanac?
Aldus (Jess): ye
Aldus (Jess): lmao
Aldus (Jess): When a clothed member of the clergy passes a citizen of Eraia, the citzen is expected to bow their head and step aside. Foreigners are at the least expected to step aside as well, which has caused trouble before. Most citizens will pull a foreigner aside as to not spark a conflict.
Aldus (Jess): elfy like "errybody get down!" when a clergy member passes
Aldus (Jess): do aldis ancestors count as his god?
Aldus (Jess): thats kinda how i think of it ~~like a dwarf would~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee it's his religion
Aldus (Jess): OPPS
It is heretical to speak of another God in Eraia. No crime, murder included, is ranked worse than slandering or promoting another God. If you aren’t attacked on the spot, you’ll be arrested and tried in the church.
Afina (Georgia🍀): He prays to them don't he
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Aldus (Jess): rip aldi you going down
Aldus (Jess): someone get this boi a copy of eraian doctrine before he FUCKS UP
Afina (Georgia🍀): *afina chucks a book at him at Mach 5*
Aldus (Jess): thanks XD
Aldus (Jess): dis shit:
Wynne: Eraia considers Wynne to be heretical two fold, for both their ancestoral beliefs and primary diet of deer. Putting aside any differences with Callora, Eraia could never be allied with Wynne even indirectly. Wynne is currently out of sight out of mind, but that could change in time.
Aldus (Jess): 👀
Bill: Oh hey.
Bill: That's good shit.
Aldus (Jess): and:
Callora: As the nearest neighbor of Eraia, Callora was the first nation Eraia tried to spread their religion to. While that conflicct ended in a stalemate, the tension between the nations has never relaxed. While not actively at war, every citizen of Eraia knows Callora would be the first nation in the second crusade of Eraia.
Aldus (Jess): callora and wynne are allies
Bill: yup.
Bill: Only true political alliance in the world.
Bill: Theanovene is kinda riding the line of 'don't fuck with us and we'll service you'.
Aldus (Jess): does wynnes military have human and laguz?
Bill: yup.
Aldus (Jess): good good
Bill: The wolves in Wynne are respected members of the community. ~~It's the only place laguz are respected and yet half the players were like furry me up~~
Aldus (Jess): look we only got 2 now
Afina (Georgia🍀): FURRY ME UP BILLY
Bill: I just shivered.
Bill: please do not.
Aldus (Jess): and neither of them is good at laguzing
Aldus (Jess): ~~well apparently elfy is about to be but WHOMP~~
Bill: Also, wolves aren't actually common outside of Wynne. Cat and Tiger are the dominant laguz.
Bill: Rabbits are also mostly on their island. (remember them, they exist.)
Aldus (Jess): ~~laguz besides wolves exist?~~
Aldus (Jess): questions
Aldus (Jess): Dreca: Eraia is being attacked by Dreca. To Eraia, both in propoganda and reality, Dreca is a corrupted country controlled by Lyarlel. It’s militaristic nature and cruel treatment of the laguz after the invasion on the main land are all actions in line with the teachings of Lyarlel. Given this, the war with Dreca is not just self defense, it’s a holy crusade.
Aldus (Jess): Does dreca actually worship lararara?
Aldus (Jess): or is that just what eraia thinks?
Bill: Lylalel and Lyarlel are Eraian gods.
Aldus (Jess): ok so no
Bill: Nokri is the only one who would know, but no.
Bill: who wrote all these great world tidbits, damn.
Bill: I did way better than I thought when I wrote the world guide.
Aldus (Jess): ooo so there ARE languages
Aldus (Jess): so does everyone speak Veen then?
Bill: That sounds way too much like Peen to be used as shorthand, oh my good *I called it that the fuck*.
Bill: Yes, Veen is common.
Elfriede (Tom): PEEN IS COMMON
Elfriede (Tom): LET IT BE KNOWN
Aldus (Jess): lmao good one past billy
Afina (Georgia🍀): PEEN
Afina (Georgia🍀): everyone speaks it
Afina (Georgia🍀): _everyone_
Aldus (Jess): Wynnites use the occasional word from Wynnish day to day
Afina (Georgia🍀): NICE
Bill: Why don’t you just stick to ship names for the actual ships...?
Aldus (Jess): LOL WUT
Bill: I think my phone glitched.
Bill: That was from earlier.
Aldus (Jess): yea id say so lmao
Bill: Okay, I’m seeing this unfold now. When the reveal of the Enera story is uncovered, immediately following will be the climax of the lego reveal. Everyone riding the Enera storyline will be forced to move quickly on the Enera story because of the legos.
Aldus (Jess): im assuimg these things have to do with each other?
Bill: Eeeeeh. Not really.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sorta
Afina (Georgia🍀): Vaguely
Bill: *You don’t know the end of the Enera story either*
Aldus (Jess): so only afina will be there for the lego reveal?
Bill: Ye.
Aldus (Jess): damn
Bill: Oh Afina will bust Elfie to anyone who’ll listen I bet.
Afina (Georgia🍀): :3c
Bill: “I almost COURTED with this DIRTY LEGO”
Aldus (Jess): aldus is like "say what now"
Aldus (Jess): i want aldus to have a "you should be thankful" moment with elfy
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah it depends
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not sure how many should find out overall
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina will be the only one to see first ~~paw~~ hand
Bill: It’s going to get out to the party.
Bill: That’s a given.
Bill: Then everyone can rake him over the coals a bit before we actually start the fixing it process.
Aldus (Jess): I MEAN lets be honest here
Aldus (Jess): afina needs to be raked too
Afina (Georgia🍀): :3c
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah truuu
Bill: Afina: you liar
Aldus: you should be thankful
Eliran: I said not to hurt her
Nokri: I just hate people
Desii: *attempts to be threatening but trips*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Poor Elfriede he's gonna feel like shit
Bill: Then Afrin get shit on for being a bitch to him, everyone gets done with their shit, Elfriede rescues Afina in a fight even tho she a bitch, Afina haughtily apologizes and says “can we start over”
Aldus (Jess): To Elfy: "you should be proud of your heritage, your wolf form is a gift!"
To Afina: "How dare you leave someone based on their race?!"
Bill: And then they fuck.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Literally everyone is gonna shit on Afina for being racist so that'll be good lol
Aldus (Jess): i wish the characters had gottne more time to know each other though
Aldus (Jess): i mean some know each other well but like aldus, nokri and desii dont know shit about elfy and afina
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran will be a nice bridge between
Afina (Georgia🍀): I imagine Afina will complain to Eliran and Eliran will diverge it to the other three
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Aldus may not know Elfriede TOO well but elfriedes initial aggression is gonna make him predisposed to get involved
Afina (Georgia🍀): Plus the "repressed laguz" thing is gonna hit a NERVE on aldus
Aldus (Jess): OH YEA thats why i want him to know about it though
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye it'll disseminate through the party then for sure
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina's not a loud mouth but Eliran's a trusted friend and he LIVES for having info
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Eliran is gonna wanna talk about it
Aldus (Jess): i feel like maybe afina should get to know aldus though? like naturaly so she can see that laguz are normal?
Aldus (Jess): I think one of the best ways to overcome prejudices to to actually get to know people of the group that you are  prejudiced against
Aldus (Jess): i mean obviously thats allready been started with elfy and atalantia but elfy is also racist to extent becuase he is ashamed he is a laguz and aatalantia was pretty tribal
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah talking to Aldus is definitely gonna be part of the healing process
Afina (Georgia🍀): But yeah then maybe Aldus and Desii should rendezvous with Afina after her training with the bishop
Afina (Georgia🍀): So when we post on Thursday
Aldus (Jess): is afina where desii got the enera lead?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): Technically Aldus and Desii can flag Afina down before she reaches training
Aldus (Jess): yea ok so i was going to suggest that they find her anyway so i think that works?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeeet
Bill: That works.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Do they wanna find her in an aside now before she reaches training?
Afina (Georgia🍀): So she can try to slyly get info from the bishop
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~probably unsuccessfully~~
Bill: Nah.
Aldus (Jess): the times dont line up
Aldus (Jess): desii didnt get her butt out of bed until mid morning
Aldus (Jess): does eraia have a welcome center? aldus need to go there
Aldus (Jess): he need a pamphlet
Afina (Georgia🍀): This boi needs some info
Aldus (Jess): for real
Aldus (Jess): he needs the idoits guide to eraia
Afina (Georgia🍀): He can have the book that Afina doesn't want lol
Aldus (Jess): is it about eraia?
Aldus (Jess): i was gonna ask tim and elfy question but its time to go home so ill just ask in person
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): And yeah it was like easy stuff about eraia
Afina (Georgia🍀): With some snippets of the language
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~she was gonna throw it out or sell it, along with a book on the history of laguz~~
Elfriede (Tom): aight now that im home
Elfriede (Tom): i gots to do some asding
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): _maybe he won't recognize me like OK ELFIE SURE_

Elfriede (Tom): Do Laguz transformed
Elfriede (Tom): Have animal penises?
Eliran (Halim): Yes they should
Afina (Georgia🍀): _tom no we all talked about this yesterday_
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean they totally would but
Eliran (Halim): What if Elfriede ducked into the water transformed and ran away as a dog
Eliran (Halim): Like he hid from eliran quickly, secretly transformed and doggied his way out
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why is a doggie in the bath
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also aside 2 be like:
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Elfriede (Tom): 🙏 🙏 <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Elfriede (Tom): She peaking in on the man's bath?
Aldus (Jess): HELL YEA
Aldus (Jess): Fuck training
Aldus (Jess): Nakie Bois is priority
Eliran (Halim): Oh I forgot I need to describe Elirans naked body
Eliran (Halim): Like notable traits and such
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I forgot too lmao
Elfriede (Tom): I wanted to say he was tone with scarring but I keep forgetting to do it Everytime his shirt is off
Aldus (Jess): You gotta do that typical thing authors do when the people get nakie
Aldus (Jess): ~~like i did with Aldus~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I haven't done that with Afina 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): She's meant more to be an intellectual but that doesn't mean I should skip over her body entirely
Aldus (Jess): Afina and Aldus having matching scars
Elfriede (Tom): Nerds can be hawt too👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): DO THEY
Aldus (Jess): Ye
Elfriede (Tom): Same spot
Aldus (Jess): 
Aldus (Jess): I gotta work on drawing not stick bodied men 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh afrins a teeny bit higher but YEAH TWINSIES
Afina (Georgia🍀): We need one character outline and we just put all our characters scars on it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Honestly Aldus' scar looks like scarring from nokri tryna steal his kidney or something lol
Aldus (Jess): "wanna see my sweet child abuse scar?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like that was my first thought
Aldus (Jess): Oh no lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): _omg_
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): All his scaring from Nokri is only internal
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omgg it true tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): All these kiddos have body scars
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why no one got like an arm scar
Aldus (Jess): Aldus scar is from getting attaked by his father in wolf form RIP
Aldus (Jess): I might give him more scars not sure
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina's is from being attacked by laguz when she was a little
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfies is from the rabbit laguz stabbing him
Afina (Georgia🍀): ALL LAGUZ INFLICTED
Afina (Georgia🍀): CoINCIDENCE? I think NOT
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): I have in Aldus back story they some racist poachers tried to attach him once too
Aldus (Jess): Maybe he should have a scar from that too <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh yeah does that mean people don't go hunting for wolves in aurii then, out of fear of killing a person on accident?
Aldus (Jess): Hmmm 🤔
Aldus (Jess): Hmmm 🤔
Aldus (Jess): Yea I'm not even sure if my racist poacher thing is realistic for aurii
Bill: In Wynne? It ain’t.
Aldus (Jess): Damn that was a good tragic bit
Bill: In the Kissaelain territories it is.
Aldus (Jess): I had that they weren't from wyne tho
Bill: Wynnites would fuck anyone trying to start a trade like that up.
