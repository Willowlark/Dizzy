ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): 
Nokri (Marisa): The cloaked figure sat, slouched over with his back against the wall in the worst-lit corner of the pub. The light above the table had gone out but Almeath was on vacation and wouldn't be back to fix the bulb until Wednesday. The figure looked hot dressed in multiple layers of black in the midst of a summer heatwave - and not in the hot way. His hair was slicked with sweat and his face greasy just as it was on the night his parents died. Killed by an assassin who snuck into the monastery where the cloaked figure devoted his life to mystical kung-fu, and then just as silently snuck back into the night. Yes. That was why he was in this hole-in-the-wall rinky dink pub. To find his parent's murderers and obtain revenge for mystical kung-fu Master Vokraeck.
Bill: I have a thing for that. 100 pages of tables that make your full backstory for a fantasy setting.
