Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~theoretically could Afina and Elfriede take him is what I'm asking~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I guess I could write to avoid conflict
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's just harder
Afina (Georgia🍀): But also combat is gonna just get drawn out oof
Nokri (Marisa): The key to beating him
Afina puts on her robe and wizard hat
Eliran (Halim): Nah she takes of her robes
Afina (Georgia🍀): Put on the sexy armor
Eliran (Halim): Stuns him with the light of laera
Eliran (Halim): ~~cause she so white~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg
Eliran (Halim): ~~her skin reflects all of his attacks~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): "I'll show you the light of Laera Cardinal sir" *takes off shirt*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede just dies
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: you really _have_ grown since the last time I saw you
Afina (Georgia🍀): Okay so here's the rock and the hard place
Afina (Georgia🍀): If Afina pursues diplomacy, the only good card she has to play is the "Callora won't like how Bishop Toronto treated me" card
Afina (Georgia🍀): But that basically admits that she and Elfriede are guilty of killing him
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or they could do it a la "leave no witnesses" style and kill the Cardinal too, on the assumption that they can even do that
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or they can flee which leaves it completely up to chance how the Cardinal reports Afina's involvement in the situation, and is the option Afina would be least likely to take because it jeopardizes Laera the most
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri climbs back up through the wall to yell at the cardinal
“do you KNOW who she IS? This PRINCESS?? A MEMBER of the ROYAL family?? boy you better stop”
Elfriede (Tom): 
Elfriede (Tom): Plz stop mr cardinal sir
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's it that's the plan
Afina (Georgia🍀): Scrap everything else
Aldus (Jess): PLZ
