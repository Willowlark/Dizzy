eliran is like "finally. a break from babysitting."
Afina (Georgia🍀): meaning marisa youd have to add onto your nokri post
Nokri (Marisa): I can do that. i was originally planning on doing 2 posts but i didn't think that'd be allowed
Eliran (Halim): Aldus ends up getting semi protective of Nokri cause Elfriede is a military boi and notices her drecan look
Eliran (Halim): Eliran and desi go to church cause Desi wants to light magic and Eliran is delivering some mail
Nokri (Marisa): time to start a ~~dogfight~~ fistfight in the middle of the street
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 😱
Aldus (Jess): I ammmm exhausted and probably won't be posting so just pull Aldi along wherever you go
Afina (Georgia🍀): aight so imma write afina bumping into eliran and nokri

Nokri (Marisa): https://78.media.tumblr.com/c6eaf8d9d1fe151ca1db2cb7a268f088/tumblr_inline_nv04f1CBgQ1slbryt_500.gif
Afina (Georgia🍀): who are those two
Nokri (Marisa): shin-ah is all the hot people. jaeha is eliran trying to get some and hak is aldus just walking by
Eliran (Halim): Shin-ah is Elfriede, hiding his tail and face from the world
Jaeha is eliran, because of course he'd look fly af in bathhouse, even when youre supposed to be naked
Eliran (Halim): Aldus is Hak just goin about his business
Nokri (Marisa): Eliran needs that Aesthetic™ everywhere
Nokri (Marisa): the mask symbolizes Elfriede's desire to mask his true nature as a laguz. in this essay I will be explaining
Afina (Georgia🍀): ooo insightful
Nokri (Marisa): where did shin-ah get his mask from if he dove into the onsen without it
was it under his towel
Nokri (Marisa): Nice:thumbs_up:Post
Nokri (Marisa): fudge
Afina (Georgia🍀): GOOD POST
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!184437198865563648> you might wanna delay posting for later today?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: My entire life can be explained in Yona gifs
Bill: More like till tomorrow. I’m going to a play tonight and didn’t write posts this morning, doubt I’ll have time in the evening.
Eliran (Halim): Can Eliran and Afina aside together considering she just ran into him during post, or should we wait for the post
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <@351471675843411978> <@301927856240459777> I'm like dead tired right now, so prob later  but.. since Afina left Elfriede in the market to pick up her shit, I'll have Elfriede bump into you guys somehow since you are in the market
Aldus (Jess): mmkay

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'll post today, prob before I leave work,I think this will work
Aldus (Jess): well hals post says we just left the bathouse
Aldus (Jess): so there would be a continuity issue unless we just kinda fuge it so hal left before us

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Rightt.. hmm I'll need to think up a dif post ending  then
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri exists the bath. “Where the [censored] did everybody go.”
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Is nokri... Short?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I never figured out how tall Elfriede was, I think I've just always thought he was average while Yuria was Slightly taller than him.
Aldus (Jess): Aldus is 5'9"
Aldus (Jess): i think nokri has a canon height?
Nokri (Marisa): Ya I think she does. I can check in a few minutes
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'mma say Elfriede is 5'7". I feel like Aldus should be taller
Aldus (Jess): aldi also looks taller cuz of his ears mhm
Nokri (Marisa): No she doesn’t oops. 
I’ll say 5 feet? We’ve said she’s short in canon before right. That’s not too short but dang y’all’s characters are tall
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ehh ft is pretty short I'd say
Bill: 5 feet is like, smol Jess short.
Bill: Katy's friend.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeee
Nokri (Marisa): My medical records say I’m 5’ but I feel more 5’1”
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I think she's like 4 9
Aldus (Jess): ohh yea i was gonna say im 5'3"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Wait your that short Marisa?
Nokri (Marisa): Are you gonna fight me about it
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I've never noticed 🤔 🤔
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~howcute❤ ~~
Aldus (Jess): she was probably wearing heels whenever you have seen her
Nokri (Marisa): It says so on my license but I feel taller I dunno. I need a measuring stick.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 😱
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Wow how have I never noticed this,I feel so bamboozled
Nokri (Marisa): The long con
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'm just so short that I think all women's are the same height as me <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~for a dude I guess~~
Nokri (Marisa): The female Tom reveal

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Keep it that way 🙌
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~For the moment, not like forever~~
Aldus (Jess): what u gon do to her
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): ~~not if aldi buys her a headband~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Is he gonna do that?
Aldus (Jess): wait your gonna mistake nokri for afina arent you?
Aldus (Jess): idk i thought about it
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760> initially
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Also Aldus for Atalantia
Aldus (Jess): like "here i saw you looking at those headbands so i got you this as a peace offering"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yee if you wanna do that do ett, otherwise I was gonna have Elfriede buy one or two for Afina then give one to her.
Aldus (Jess): wait why would elfriede buy nokri something?
Aldus (Jess): ~~why would aldus buy he something too but ya know~~
Aldus (Jess): wait so Elfriede would be like "oh hey ainfa, i see you found alalantia"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: He wouldn't buy nokri something but he might give her something he already bought if he feels bad,
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And no that'll just be how he notices them
Aldus (Jess): oooo ok
Aldus (Jess): yea that works i guess. unless mawisa wants nokris down hair look to be part of The New Nokri™
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah, doesn't mean she can have a hairband tho
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But if you want Aldus to do it I won't write that in
Nokri (Marisa): Are we still in super dirty clothes? Nokri got dragged around and I never wrote her changing. I assume she lost all her things to the bandits so either super dirty clothes or borrowing someone else’s
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah exactly, I was gonna have Elfriede notice and possibly point out those things
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Also neck rope burns among other things...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'm sure she isn't looking too good
Aldus (Jess): Nokri doesnt have money?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede> Aw... Poor girl... *Punts her to space*
Aldus (Jess): maybe she have to ask Aldi a favor <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Headcanon Elfriede is an asshole
Nokri (Marisa): I would assume not, the first post I made before editing had her bartering with some quick potions she threw together
Nokri (Marisa): I really wish I went with the running joke of not knowing his name. “Traldus pwease can I has money”
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 😂
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Her anacoda don't. Want none unless you got muns hun
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: (munies that is)
Aldus (Jess): Nokri asks aldi for money, elfriede overhears "get out of here begger!"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *Elfriede scoffs at a begger*
Aldus (Jess): since we allready know he doesnt like beggers
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I really like the dynamic where Elfriede thinks Nokri is really nice and Aldus has just lost his mind lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: "Idk man I don't see it?"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: "Your telling me she put poison ivy on your cuts?"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: "Naww not her look how smol"
Aldus (Jess): pwease be nice to him 😭
Nokri (Marisa): personal knight of a princess
that's a pretty high status
nokri would put on a nice act, doubly so whenever afina is around
Nokri (Marisa): elfriede has really nice armor too right. he would be the kind of person to wear high quality stuff?
Aldus (Jess): well aldus would probably just not tell him opinion to elfriede so
Nokri (Marisa): as in, you can smell the money based on the apparel
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah truthh
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah I mean he's wearing his nice Eraian armour over his family clothes so yeah..
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oo and it's almost winter so his family hooked him up with a furry cloack
Nokri (Marisa): ye that armor gotta be pretty pricey, and as an unknown stranger she'd be courteous out of caution anyway
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yee trueee

Aight I have a basic idea of what I'mma write
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'll skip the hairband part if you are gonna have Aldi get one
Nokri (Marisa): lemme heat up some food and I'll make another post
Nokri (Marisa): begging for cash
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ah good I'll have more to go off of then 👌
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ✨ ✨ ✨
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Aight now I need some sort of tie in for Aldi
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I got something I think
Aldus (Jess): what storyline are we going with?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Imean they are meeting in the market and Elfriede will approach them
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I think I'll have him suggest returning with him for a couple reasons
Aldus (Jess): lmao i just thought of Elfriede talking to Aldus and being like "OH you're wynne? I know someone from wynee! do you know alalantia" and Aldus is like 😐
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmaooo
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like agh I know someone from China do you know
Aldus (Jess): could see afina saying it too
Aldus (Jess): does nokri always hide her accent or just since they are in eraia?
Nokri (Marisa): i had her speak it when they were camping out in the middle of nowhere
only when no one's around, or those she trusts are around (aka now aldus and eliran because life savers)
otherwise she hides it all the time. she'd hide it in any city or town and when speaking to literally anyone else.
mmmmmmaybe if she's super super shocked it'll come out as she curses but otherwise secret
Aldus (Jess): "why are you always changing you voice nokri GAWD"
Nokri (Marisa): she starts talking in fake accents every time she opens her mouth
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Do you wanna have Aldi answer nokri before or after Elfriede barges into the conversation
Aldus (Jess): yessss??? i guess
Aldus (Jess): then after that i guess we can aside
Aldus (Jess): ill try to write post in a few mins
Afina (Georgia🍀): Who knew the table merge would be so fun but _so hard to coordinate_
Aldus (Jess): Im gonna glaze over renting rooms in an inn and go with Aldus has allready done it by the time nokri asks him for money
Bill: go for it.
Nokri (Marisa): "don't worry I called ahead and booked a room"
Nokri (Marisa): "we're in the special convention room block <:lenny:395307171539189760>"
Aldus (Jess): "we're here ffor Auriicon"
Aldus (Jess): now wheres that ~~jess~~ fan service line i wronte

Aldus (Jess): OK fan service and actual post incoming
Nokri (Marisa): did you want to aside? i can stick around for about 20 more minutes, or alfredo's post might interrupt them before nokri responds
Aldus (Jess): i think <@!351785752197201920>  is going to inturupt?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: OKAY I have written it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lyarlel has followers?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lemme read yours and make sure it works

Aldus (Jess): "why does this man smell like hes trying to cover up his BO with 10 cans of axe"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede wears axe canon
Aldus (Jess): Elfriede is a middle school boy in gym class, its canon
Nokri (Marisa): oh no flashbacks to middle school
Aldus (Jess): WOW that was on point
Bill: which can either be handwaved as 'she spends so much time around laguz, she noticed how different *Afina* smelled and figured the rest out from there', or Aldus can be like "da faq? He fuck a wolf girl recently?".

Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~daddy can set her up with _daddy_~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I regret that sentence as soon as I typed it omg
Bill: Desii would have glasses in a modern au.
Aldus (Jess): ~~i want a romance plot for aldus cuz im trash and it looks like so much fun 😭 ~~
Bill: ~~at least this time you're talking about a fictional character~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus can BE the two timing wolf lmao
Nokri (Marisa): i will 100% aid in making a VN but i don't trust myself not to butcher everyone's characters so if you supply lines it can be done
Bill: Yeah, the script for a VN is many many long boi posts.
Bill: so.
Bill: Priorities.
Nokri (Marisa): they can be short, some are only like 10 minutes long
Bill: also you've got Nokri and Desii for romance plots.
Nokri (Marisa): there are some really good ones under an hour
Nokri (Marisa): everyone must be romanceable. everyone. lololol is secret bonus romance.
Bill: ~~You've got Desii~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ooo <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~Eliran?~~
Bill: Lylalel pulls some Ah my Goddess bullshit and falls from the sky, starts living with Elfreide and low key tryin ta fuck.
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: Aldo is a straight boi.
Aldus (Jess): high key jelly of afina elfriede tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Gomennnnn they're too trope-y it's our faults
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nah just how the cards fell
Aldus (Jess): I wanna have shippy fun too 😦
Afina (Georgia🍀): You got three players to choose from 😏
Aldus (Jess): 2 hun, 2

Aldus (Jess): or afina decides she REALLY like wolf bois
Afina (Georgia🍀): _Eliran and Aldus can work_
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~did somebody say hatefuck~~
Aldus (Jess): 🙄
Afina (Georgia🍀): I know they just bow bros
Afina (Georgia🍀): _it possible tho_
Aldus (Jess): anything is *possible*
Aldus (Jess): atalantia would make aldus pass out
Aldus (Jess): he'd be like NOW THATS A LAGUZ WOMAN WHOO
Aldus (Jess): see with afina elfriede it was like natural
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She *might* be coming back 👌
Bill: So you want that Atalantia ship is what you're saying.
Aldus (Jess): not necessarily
Aldus (Jess): im just salty today
Bill: *saltiness, what a foreign concept to me*
Bill: How would each relationship go?
Aldus (Jess): idk i dont know enough about desii, nokri would prob just torture him
Bill: Yeah, the original idea was Nokri is a pain in the ass, but Aldi wuves her because when they're alone together she's totally different. Aldi would also be able to reign Nokri in by going all boyfriend on her.
Bill: But Nokri is less tsundere and more just jerk, so that idea is shot.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Or was, she really hasn't been a jerk in like a month
Aldus (Jess): ~~would you date her?~~

Atalantia Enneka (Allison): But yeah, I'm down to join again. Guess I just gotta think of a reason why Atalantia left/back again
Bill: ~~too much sexual tension?~~

Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Hmm I'll have to brainstorm
Bill: 
Bill: All black (probably sketch) building is excellent example of Eraian architecture.
