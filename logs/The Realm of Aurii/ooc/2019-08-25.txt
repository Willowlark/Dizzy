Bill: Yeah so. I gotta stay true to fire emblem lore and not play a male Pegasus knight, as they donâ€™t exist. Peg knights are from Wynne, the male flying units are always wyvern riders. Which are from. Dreca.
Bill: Which means to play a flyer knight, Iâ€™d be from Dreca and Iâ€™d probably have.
Bill: *backstory*
Bill: *with*
Bill: *Nokri*
Aldus Larian (Jess): you dont have to stay true to fire emblem lore tho ðŸ˜®
Bill: Nah Iâ€™m a traditionalist.
Bill: Besides, it might be a good thing to give Nokri someone who has a direct connection to her past.
Bill: ~~call her on her shit, for example~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait so why do you hate it?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Peg knight sounds kinky <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Cause backstory with Nokri means bullying lol Nokri going to destroy me somehow.
Nokri (Marisa): not really?
despite how you make it with every NPC, nokri is supposed to be considered a polite and charming girl because she's always putting on an act.
Nokri (Marisa): her whole shtick is that she's secretly two-faced, people from her past probably wouldn't of been bullied by her at all because she sticks to herself
Nokri (Marisa): someone from dreca would also know her by a different name. i gotta recall what that was
Bill: Iâ€™d assume the character would know about the two faced ness.
Nokri (Marisa): orly?
Nokri (Marisa): then it would be someone super super close to her
Bill: I mean, again assumptions, cause you can veto any relation at all, Nokri is your character. But if weâ€™d have one I think itâ€™d be worth making it a stronger one, cause it gives us repore.
Bill: Imo.
Nokri (Marisa): *a yandere who stalked her*
Nokri (Marisa): "who are you?"
"oh you don't know me but i have a wall covered entirely in your face"
Bill: I wouldnâ€™t want to do that, but ye lol
