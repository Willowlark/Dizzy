Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Afina is ready to start whenever 👏
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): <@184437198865563648> well I'm waiting to hear back about a graduate assistantship, so if I get it I'll live with Nick near Rowan for the 2 years I go to grad school. Otherwise I'm gonna look up in North or South Jersey for jobs for a year and save money to attend grad school
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Also thank you!!! 😊
Bill: Grad school for psych?
