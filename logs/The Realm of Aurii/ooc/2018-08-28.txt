Bill: <@&358049600172589067>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Magic notes today plz?
Bill: I can do that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YAY
Bill: Alright. These are the actual notes. Each of the magics have a specific way of approaching the natural order of things.
```
Light magic *restores* the natural order of things;
Anima magic *harnesses* the natural order of things;
Dark magic *defies* the natural order of things.
```
There are a few 'secret' aspects of each magic, advanced tiers of magic that would find their basis in the corresponding school. IE, Spells far beyond the current knowledge of the magics.
```
Light: 
* Purification: Light already damages and affects things that aren't natural (humans, man made materials, other magic, etc), purification would return things to the way they were.
* Countermagic: you've already seen some of this.
* Status cures: purifying the poisons/burns/etc that ail someone. 
```
Bill: ```
Anima: 
* Animal 'control': Anima harnesses nature; animals are natural. 
* Plant magic: obvious.
* Buffs: Accelerated healing is speeding up the natural flow of healing. Other effects can come up in the same vein.
* Magitek: Magitek would be best powered by anima magic. This isn't animating the golem, this is the power source for a golem.
```

```
Elder:
* Healing: all healing magic is actually dark magic. It cures the body unnaturally. 
* Necromancy: Defying death is against the natural order.
* Debuffs: Corrupting or defying the way the body is supposed to be working.
* True magic: Straight up harry potter magic is actually dark magic. It does something that is unnatural. So any kind of truly magical effect is dark magic. (The details of this are still a little hazy, I don't know if I'd have the tribute part play into True Magic; it may just be that the only True Magic that's still known is the magic that does require tribute. I'll come up with something if it ever comes up; but Harry Potter magic ain't something I want to see in game.)
```

There's a floating `empath` subschool, but I never found a good spot for it. Currently emotion magic is nonexistent. 

The runes that are written into tomes is the language of the gods; and deeply related to True Magic.
Bill: The key law to follow with any spell is the first quote: light magic is purifying, anima uses the existing, and dark creates.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ooooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tho light magic can't do that for inanimate objects
Afina (Georgia🍀): Theoretically you could purify a material
Bill: you can do that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Does that mean separating it into its most basic parts?
Bill: nope. Returns it to the way things should be.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like Glenda's semblance?
