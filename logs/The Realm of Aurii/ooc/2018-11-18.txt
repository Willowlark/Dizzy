No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): a note that the waka won't leave the riverside, they're bound to the river.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the river you happened to be following <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I might try a new thing depending on how the answers lean. If a certain answer is more popular than another I'll ask you to discuss the next course of action here.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I considered adding the option to go back and fight again but honestly thatâ€™d just result in game over
Elf(riede) on a shelf: Ahhhhhhhhhh I'm 3 behinddddd
Elf(riede) on a shelf: How'd I let this happen
Elf(riede) on a shelf: Is the tar the thing that seems to smell?
Elf(riede) on a shelf: And did it only come from the sumet or the corpse too?
Elf(riede) on a shelf: (if you can't answer these that's fine too I'm just curious)
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Hewwo Iâ€™m vaguely passed out lesseee
The tar is essentially blood from the monster. Itâ€™d smell metallic and fishy. 

The sumet was the only thing that was super smelly but boy did it reek. The putrid smell doesnâ€™t come from the tar blood.
Elf(riede) on a shelf: Ahhh kkkkkkkk, we dunno what it is yet tho <:lenny:395307171539189760> <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Maybe I can tell you <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
Thereâ€™s a ton of different ways this couldâ€™ve gone despite it all leading the same way so lemme think if thereâ€™s still a use for it. There can be but it also depends on a ton of potential future stuff.
