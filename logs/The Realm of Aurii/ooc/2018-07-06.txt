Afina (Georgia🍀): Atalantia needs to come back so "She Wolf" by Shakira can go on her playlist 😂
Aldus (Jess): yaas
Bill: I need to do a post for table-1, Desii and Aldus need a plan.
Aldus (Jess): 🤷  what needs to happen in order for lego reveal to happen? arnt we just kind of waiting for that?
Bill: I'd like light shed on the Enera mystery around the same time frame. pacing wise.
Aldus (Jess): hmm ok well theres not much they can do for that since they are waiting for afina
Bill: true, unless Desii/Aldus want to try *alternative* methods of getting information.
Bill: But they good boi and good grrl so...
Afina (Georgia🍀): They could be waiting in the monastery for Afina to give the VERDICT
Bill: We don't need to post for that. Aside maybe.
Aldus (Jess): yea theres not much to post about waiting, even an aside would just be chit chat
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~Desii holds, Aldus punches, they plan B if cardinal says no~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): A lot depends on how the Cardinal reacts
