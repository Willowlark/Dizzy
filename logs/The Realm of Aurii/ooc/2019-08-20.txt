“*You get used to it.*”

*Thump* another body at the western edge of Etrina falls to the ground hissing and gurgling. “They all seem to do that when they die.” Ransford said, replying to his young companion’s disgusted face. 


“I know… but...” He let a heavy sigh escape him. He looked back at the rest of his companions. Their bright faces sullen, as they had been for the last month since he had met them. He had been glad to run into them, as he would not have survived on his own since the happening.

“Let’s move.” Ransford said with authority, gently nudging the boy onward while motioning to the rest of the party. 

They moved through the difficult mountainous terrain only dealing with smaller patches of the mist. The mountains seemed to break it up a bit, as was the Drecian’s idea. The boy never trusted her, as most did not trust someone of her features and complexion, but it seemed to work out anyways. All that was currently on the boys mind was food however, this region was unfortunately not abundant of animals or berries; in fact most of the region was bare. Whether by nature or by the mist one couldn’t say. They were however moving toward a thicker, harder to see through region.

“Stay close Phinn.” The tiger lagu told him with a nod. The late teenage boy eyed him and nodded back. 

They moved into the light mist and Phinn was hit with a tingling sensation. The lighter mist areas did not have any effect over their minds but he was never ready for the odd magical intrusion. 

A few minutes passed and Phinn suddenly started pointing and shouting. “A deer!” and there was indeed a deer standing near the thicker mist. The boy frantically grabbed for his bow slung over his shoulder. “I can get ‘im!”
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ransford glanced to the dead-still deer. It didn’t budge in the slightest at the boys voice. He attempted to interrupt, but Phinn’s beaming confidence ignored him outright and let the arrow fly. *Thunk* it landed solidly in the mostly opaque silhouette and it fell to the ground at the edge of the cloud. “Got im!” and in a flash Phinn was kneeling by the deer fishing through his pack for a hunting knife. 

Ransford sighed and slowly followed him. “That was very dangerous you realize.” Phinn grimaced at him and nodded slowly. “You tryin’ to take away from my hunting prowess pops?” The previously commander Ransford frowned and was taken aback. *Pops?*

“Listen---” Ransford began but was cut off by the buck snapping its head back tangling the boy in his antlers and tossing him at least 10 meters behind him. The deer stumbled to its feet and charged at the commander, eyes gleaming purple. Not a moment later it was struck in the chest by another arrow and blasted back by a beam of light from his allies. 


“Phinn?!” The tiger laguz shouted, to which there was no reply other than quickly shuffling feet out of the woods… and the mist. Phinn ran at them with reckless abandon as if nothing else in the world mattered to him than getting to the party. Ransford raised his shield and sighed, absolutely emotionally beat down. “I cant save anyone can I..?”

Another party member stepped in out front of the commander, a deep frown on his face. Phinn ran at him just a few meters away and you could see the glow in his eyes. *again and again.* “Just like San.., just like Eliran.” He stepped forwards and assumed his stance, thrusting out forward’s skewering the young boy in his late teens through the heart. Phinn’s body immediately fell limp as Elfriede caught him, slowly lowering him to the ground. He blinked away his brimming tears as the boys eyes closed forever.

The group stood in silence for a while.

*You get used to it.*
Bill: *Did you kill off Elfriede*
