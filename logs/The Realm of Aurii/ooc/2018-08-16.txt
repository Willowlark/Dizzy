Dizzy: GM posts come out today.
Aldus (Jess): The posting sheduele is fucky now, are posts actually today?
Bill: Yeah. Still Monday Thursday.
Aldus (Jess): Oof ok 😬
Nokri (Marisa): elfriede tells nokri she's kind
"of [censored] course i am, i'm a saint"
Aldus (Jess): Posting is getting away from me so bad these days
Bill: Has for all of us, we're fixing that now.
Nokri (Marisa): same aaaa
biru is post day doing to be in your morning or evening?
Bill: Evening. probs 6amish your time I'll start writing.
Nokri (Marisa): ok yay. i'm cooking everything in my fridge right now but i can post afterwards.
Nokri (Marisa): **mega soup**
Aldus (Jess): I have to read like 2 weeks worth of posts everytime I go to do it I get distracted by something <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: That's why I do it on the train; anywhere else it's distracting.
Aldus (Jess): I do not has a train
Nokri (Marisa): buy one
Elfriede (Tom): Woman where is my soup~~er suit~~
Eliran (Halim): <@!184437198865563648>  just checking but i thought you said light magic can't effect inanimate objects
Bill: Nope.
Eliran (Halim): nope as in you never said that or nope as in they cant
Bill: never said.
Eliran (Halim): kk
Eliran (Halim): rip eliran
Eliran (Halim): talk about shite rolls
Bill: Desii, play despacito.
Bill: Edited in the stat block from last round. (I'm assuming Nokri and Afina aren't going to roll dice to defend against nothing, it's meta but lets me post the block)
Aldus (Jess): im confused how shit works now that i mssed a round
Bill: Basically, post, and you'll get dice.
Bill: The stat blocks being delayed are because I need everyone to roll dice for it, and sometimes people post before everyone rolls dice.
Eliran (Halim): question for afina's spell to actually defend eliran
I assume georgia needs to roll to defend eliran specifically?
Eliran (Halim): or would it be a roll to cancel his spell
Eliran (Halim): also bill for the last stat block shouldn't eliran have only taken 1 damage?
Eliran (Halim): wait nevermind
Eliran (Halim): i got confused which is which block my mistake
Bill: Well, to be honest the spells aren't going to cancel out.
Bill: so it's not really defending you at all.
Eliran (Halim): why wouldn't they
Eliran (Halim): cause that I know was a mechanic you mentioned before 
During the pirate fight if i remember correctly
Bill: :3
Bill: That specifically cancelled out an *anima* magic spell.
Bill: not *light* magic.
Bill: Georgia can edit whenever she gets up no problem, Afina would have known that it wouldn't cancel, but that's in reference to one of the undiscovered properties of light magic as a whole.
Nokri (Marisa): idk what to have nokri do aside from chuck stuff
is it possible for her to like. tackle enera out the window
Eliran (Halim): so question
Bill: Anything is possible if you B E L E I V E
Eliran (Halim): is the current status block thats up based on which set of rolls
Bill: The ones we just did.
Eliran (Halim): so elirans full miss set
Bill: Yes.
Eliran (Halim): ok
Nokri (Marisa): lemme know if i should change
Nokri (Marisa): ~~rip enera. cause of death: nokri~~
Nokri (Marisa): this is part of her yolo attribute if that does anything
Nokri (Marisa): can sneaky dice be used for sneaking to enera
Eliran (Halim): Everybody to Enera: come on you can do it snap out of it its gonna be ok
Eliran (Halim): Nokri to Enera: YEET
Bill: You get more dice if it’s related to yolo!
Nokri (Marisa): running becomes sneaky if you naruto run
Elfriede (Tom): Tru
Elfriede (Tom): My childhood self ageees
Eliran (Halim): hey bill how did you make the cards
Eliran (Halim): I wanna do one for eliran
Bill: https://crobi.github.io/rpg-cards/generator/generate.html
Bill: That said...
Bill: I did em up awhile ago.
Bill: I just need to export them.
Eliran (Halim): yeah but its an outdated one
Bill: ah, fair point.

This is the `contents` section of the card.
Bill: You can edit it as you see fit.
Eliran (Halim): thankss~~
Eliran (Halim): ok awesome done
Eliran (Halim): btws Long lost nobilitiy is the same as noble tradition, I jsut figured the name fit better
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll change it to fire then instead of light Afina uses
Bill: That'll eliminate the fire spell, not the light spell.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _but the pirate fight_
Bill: you eliminated *his* fire spell.
Afina (Georgia🍀): But the light went whoosh that time too
Afina (Georgia🍀): _afrins just gonna yeet this bitch on fire at this rate_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Im just gonna attack the Cardinal
Afina (Georgia🍀): Fuck da police
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ah but calloras not gonna like that
Bill: wweeee political fallout!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Does dark magic cancel light
Afina (Georgia🍀): Everyone would be mad shooketh if Afrin picked up a dark magic tomes but ay she's been ogling the one in her possession for a while anyways
Bill: No. Depending on the dark spell effect, Light magic also cancels Dark Magic out.
Bill: Not the weapon triangle. 😛
Afina (Georgia🍀): No wonder these clergy dudes and stuck up princesses pick light magic, it's the most OP
Bill: It's far less destructive and versatile than anima or dark.
Bill: case in point, it's fucking hard to come up with light spells.
Bill: Dunno how you've been doing it so long.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 💕my devotion to Afina keeps me going 💕
Bill: Gay.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Anyways idk what to write in this scene then
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think she shouldjust attack the man
Afina (Georgia🍀): They kidnapped her citizen
Afina (Georgia🍀): She has the moral right in the end
Bill: (Does Afina know that for sure?)
Afina (Georgia🍀): Noooo cause she was too busy being assaulted by the bishop to hear Enera tell her story
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof finally resuscitated only to still be unable to do anything
Bill: ask questions. you can "damage" Morras by weakening his resolve to fight. If he stops fighting, it's the same as beating him physically. (effectively.)
Afina (Georgia🍀): So Eliran is still definitely taking that hit tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina could throw herself in front?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just don't think she would let Eliran get the full force of that spell
Bill: Afrin would need to go through the entire effect of the spell.
Bill: that's like, 20 feet of burning coals to keep someone from stepping in 5 feet.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah then she's probably gonna KO again realistically speaking cause she just got de-poisoned
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ahhhhh there is nothing to dooooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Billiam her hands are tied
Bill: ~~that can be arranged~~
Aldus (Jess): "finally" you were out for like one round lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): _it was so long all I wanted to do was post_
Afina (Georgia🍀): If the Cardinal takes time to tie up Afina, the least threatening person there, I think someone is definitely gonna stab that guy in the neck
Bill: pfft
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ok so light magic can affect non-organic things?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina could get a pot shot off the roof and make the rubble fall between Eliran and the Cardinal
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~is there any roof left~~
Eliran (Halim): i don't understand how light magic is weaker than other magic
Eliran (Halim): as of right now it can apparently nullify any magic, it affects the real world just as much
Bill: hmm. Hal may have remembered correctly before. I need to review the magic notes in the notebook I have at home...
Bill: Hal, in what context were you asking about affect non organic things?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I asked like 5ever ago
Eliran (Halim): you deflected my arrows using light magic
Afina (Georgia🍀): And that was the whole reason Afina took up fire magic
Eliran (Halim): and destroyed a wall with it too
Eliran (Halim): I kinda accepted the wall thing but I feel like if you can't enchant an arrow/sword using magic
Eliran (Halim): or surround it in magic or whateves
Eliran (Halim): why should any of the magic effect it
Eliran (Halim): i don't mind the fact that it doesn't hit
Afina (Georgia🍀): (And I asked about the light magic enchanting something earlier cause then Elfriede and Afina could have a combo attack)
Eliran (Halim): it seemed inconsistent with some of the fights Afina and elfriede had tho
Aldus (Jess): ~~plz give enchanted weapons~~
Eliran (Halim): ~~plz give enchanted weapons~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^
Eliran (Halim): ~~I want a magic bow~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~me too~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~or arrows~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): (This is lowkey why I wanted to have the mysteries of magic revealed so I could write according to Da Rules)
Aldus (Jess): ok so
Nokri healed afina
Were all trying to get enera to jump
morass is trying to pull rank on elfy
nokri has a shard of glass as a weapon
Aldus (Jess): morras is doing some magic i dont understand
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran is at 1 HP and there is light flying at his face
Bill: wrong way Georgia. The light spell hit him already.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Fixed it
Bill: Okay. The wall does make sense, in a roundabout way. I'm not going to dig into it that much because retconning. The *arrows* you are correct Hal, they shouldn't be deflected by light magic. As stated I want to reread the notes I have at home on it, but they wouldn't be deflected. Now, if they have leather to wrap about the arrow head and attach it to the shaft, the *leather* would be be damaged. I can edit the post to this effect, but it's namely a way to keep the fight from being 'arrow in head, he dead'. Specifically, the metal arrow head, wooden shaft, and animal feathers would be fine on an arrow.
Bill: I'd revisit talking about removing the mystery of magic (in meta, not canon), but later when I have that notebook.
Bill: No one in Aurii knows *how* to enchant a weapon.
Bill: If you were to have one you'd have to find one that was somehow enchanted before.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Consult Da Book
Eliran (Halim): eyyy bill
Eliran (Halim): you know how we got a lowkey quest to eblia for aldus's potion
Bill: mhmmm
Eliran (Halim): can there be a really old enchanted bow there or something related to Elirans fam
Eliran (Halim): like legendary first king bs or something
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like mysteries are cool but magic is something integral to Afina's character so I feel like something so important shouldn't be a secret also because it's been a year of playtime and I don't think I'm closer to stumbling on anything
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~also rewrites because the rules of magic don't allow something are annoying~~
Bill: Discovering the secrets of magic could be an interesting plot arc, that's the primary reason I left that loose. *That said*,  the mystery part of Trisp flopped hard.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I meaaan now we have "political fallout from trisp" arc
Bill: Yuria is a dangling arc.
Bill: Aldo needs Drugs.
Afina (Georgia🍀): So we got no time for magyyks
Bill: Nokri needs a *soul*.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina's gonna nyoom on dark magic arc
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfies having an identity crisis arc
Afina (Georgia🍀): racism arc
Afina (Georgia🍀): Too much too much
Bill: ~~I'm saving things for later too you know~~
Bill: But yes, we can revisit that.
Elfriede (Tom): LET IT HAPPEN
Bill: The priorities have shifted to the game, discovery ala a traditional PnP doesn't translate well while character arcs/development are more pronounced.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeahhhhh
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's true
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean other stuff can stay a mystery
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just feel like I'm walking into invisible walls trying to write light magic
Bill: ~~you aren't the only one~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean I would have the mechanic under control if not for the mysteriessas
Afina (Georgia🍀): I also have zero clue what to do with editing my post now oof
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also there needs to be SOME way to counter light magic
Afina (Georgia🍀): Even with it being less versatile, i believe the wiki says it's more reliable?
Afina (Georgia🍀): So it's lowkey OP to have magic that can't be blocked or deflected
Bill: go behind something inorganic?
Bill: just becuase it can't be counter spelled doesn't mean it's uncounterable.
Aldus (Jess): was my summary correct cuz im cnfused on whats going on
Bill: ye
Aldus (Jess): ok
Afina (Georgia🍀): But can't you also block anima by hiding behind things?
Afina (Georgia🍀): But also you can block anime with light but not light with anything
Afina (Georgia🍀): BLOCK ANIME LMAO
Bill: sure. Anima effects the object though, so a metal object hit with lightning conducts the electricity, wood burns, etc.
Bill: Light magic doesn't cancel other light magic.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Anima neither
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also dark neither
Eliran (Halim): I feel like you should have a triangle for it
Bill: There's a reason it does this.
Elfriede (Tom): BLOCK ANIME WITH LIGHT
Afina (Georgia🍀): Block the weebs
Afina (Georgia🍀): Anyways I would much appreciate the secrets of Da Book
Bill: still as work soooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye I know just for later
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill we at the grocery and then hals gonna post
Aldus (Jess): someone post for me
Afina (Georgia🍀): Someone tell me what my options left to post are
Aldus (Jess): i dont even know whats going on with all the magic
Bill: I’m not starting posts till I get on the train, which is going to 7:30.
Eliran (Halim): Eliran is an angry boi
Afina (Georgia🍀): I took out the attack part but Afina still needs to do _something_
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> If you'd like to sell me on an approach for your post, you can. I'm going to call it Flashy because you're snarking at Morras. It's only for defensive purposes, you can't attack Morras, but if you have a thought share.
Bill: <@!288513265661902858> Excellent work integrating your dice rolls into your post. Your writing totally supports Eliran having a shit round.
Elfriede (Tom): He's not ready to attack morras
Elfriede (Tom): Emotionally
Bill: mhmm. This is just about what approach to tie your post to.
