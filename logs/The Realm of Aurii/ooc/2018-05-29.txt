Afina (Georgia🍀): wooOOOOOO COLLABORATION
Afina (Georgia🍀): TABLE MERGE YE-AH
Aldus (Jess): I'mma just say it
Aldus (Jess): I have NO ideas for trisp
Aldus (Jess): That is all
Eliran (Halim): My only idea
Eliran (Halim): is that Eliran fucks the pope guy
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~cant wait to rub my racist little afina hands all over everything~~
Eliran (Halim): literally Blowing his mind 😏
Bill: A trello board might actually be useful for this...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: HOLY HELL THAT WAS ALOT TO READ
Bill: Took a few hours to type up as well.
Bill: typed things.
Bill: damn broken spacebar.
Bill: This server is probably the original cause.
Aldus (Jess): Soooo is the order of the storylines like a set thing? Or?
Aldus (Jess): Or an option
Bill: Oh, both will be running at the same time.
Aldus (Jess): Like is it storyline one needs to happen for 2 to happen?
Bill: no, same time. The scenes in storyline 2 will happen in order, but storyline 1 scenes would be shuffled in between those scenes as well.
Aldus (Jess): Are all six of us doing this together though?
Aldus (Jess): Also I didn't read table 2 so if thats pertinent idk
Bill: *You might want to*
Bill: At least the last post.
Aldus (Jess): K
Bill: Mhmm, everyone works together on it. I'm kinda crowd sourcing the DMing a bit here, to give you the opportunities to make your characters shine.
Bill: There doesn't actually have to be a defined list of scenes for this, it's just the mentality I'm trying to show.
Afina (Georgia🍀): so does table 1 peeps also get to stay at the monastery?
Bill: Not unless they can convince the Cardinal somehow?
Aldus (Jess): We're scrubs
Afina (Georgia🍀): aso "rabid animal nokri" is just too funny
Afina (Georgia🍀): so how are they gonna find enera?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~yall with the fuckin E names~~
Bill: I dunno, talking to Afina and Elfriede who *conveniently* heard her name?
Afina (Georgia🍀): touche
Bill: Also people can visit the monastery without staying there. A chance encounter can occur that way too.
Afina (Georgia🍀): so table 1 and table 2 smash together in the town yeeeet
Afina (Georgia🍀): and afina and elfie will be like yo were staying here and theyll be like YO WE WANTED TO SEE THAT TOO
Aldus (Jess): ~~i don't want to be a stickler here but if info on table 2 is pertinent to table 1 players shouldn't it be posted on table 1 also?~~
Bill: Desii will be at least.
Bill: No, because it's something only table-2 has experienced.
Aldus (Jess): K
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye its important for you to know but not aldo
Bill: you wanted to join up with the long post duo, better get used to reading.
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): 😐
Afina (Georgia🍀): welcome 2 the long haul
Bill: haha puns.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede right now> Wait... i get to bring her back?! nani?!
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: >Fuck now we have to actually discuss feelings
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: >Cant just run away
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: >oh well lets get food
Afina (Georgia🍀): LOGIC
Afina (Georgia🍀): knight light said they would talk about it at night anyways
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeee
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Cardinal Morras seems nice
Afina (Georgia🍀): actually afina hasnt showed the bishop her skillz yet so we're gonna have to find an excuse for afina and elfie NOT to talk the first night
Bill: also, shortly there won't be table-1 and table-2. We may split scenes taking place at the same time across two channels, but most activity will be done on the new table. If ya'll setup where you're meeting this round, the next round will christen that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe afina is so hype to learn magic stuff that she doesnt sleep
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: so table meet up thursday?
Afina (Georgia🍀): we get a new table right? so the logs of table 1 and 2 stay as they are?
Bill: yeah. I'll create the head table at the time.
Bill: Then the numbered tables will be used in cases like when 'elfriede and afina are going off to fuck, but the rest of the group is going to eat steak'.
Bill: *because Desii doesn't need to see that furry shit*
Afina (Georgia🍀): NEW GOAL: RUIN DESII
Afina (Georgia🍀): we need an overall of how characters will be approaching each other too i think
Bill: *I can still kill Afina off*
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~then she dies a martyr~~
Bill: in what way?
Afina (Georgia🍀): like to set the stage for meeting, how is each character gonna react to the others?
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina probably thinks desii is naive but appreciates her learning outlook on magic
Afina (Georgia🍀): afinas probably wary of aldi cause FURRY
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina and eliran are childhood bros so theyre gonna act as such
Afina (Georgia🍀): etc etc
Bill: **Desii**
**Afina** a fellow mage her own age, which is cool. 
**Elfriede** She'll probably be a bit uncomfortable with a military man, until she sees him be personal.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^ not to mention elfie has a history of being a little more stoic to people at first
Eliran (Halim): **Eliran**
**Afina** Friendo
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeahhh
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'm excited
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: AHHHHHHHHHHH
Bill: ha.
Nokri (Marisa): The merge was actually the merging of us irl as well. Our names will be one.
Afina (Georgia🍀): my favorite characters, afina, eliran, ALOUSE
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Eliran(KURTIS)
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfried(Halim)

Whelp guess you own Elfriede now
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: sorry Elfried
Eliran (Halim): YEET
Eliran (Halim): I CAN MAKE HIM A HO
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH
Eliran (Halim): I can give him the selfconfidence to come out of the closet
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: shit hes good.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~more like come out of the dog house~~
Nokri (Marisa): i like how desii is just walking around like "MAYBE SOMEONE could TEACH ME. WOW that would be nice. ANYONE."
pretending to talk to herself but actually just shouting in the middle of the town
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Afrin flys down on magical light wings

It is I
Afina (Georgia🍀): desii said eraian but she dont even know what shes in for <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Hmm how are the tables gonna honestly meet up, I mean.. Elfriede and Afina are just going to eat
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri starts hustling on the street corner
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *psstt hey Rich kids*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: wanna buy some of my **transformslaguzintihumans** potions?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Boom perfect
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: H-HEWWOO
Eliran (Halim): Eliran takes the crew to a food place post shower because he's been to trisp before maybe?
Afina (Georgia🍀): mythology class assignment: Write a blog entry in which you devise a creation myth of your own
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!184437198865563648> if i use the idea of light can i totally dual-purpose write some Eraian origin stories for play by post
Bill: Light magic has it's own history already, sorry.
Bill: You can bullshit some stuff about Lylalel and Lyarlel.
Afina (Georgia🍀): SWEET school has mEANING NOW
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> (I'm going to start using this now to ping rather than the tables, given merge) Nokri is of a race that is actively at war with Eraia. That could *definitely* create a reason for the groups to meet.
Afina (Georgia🍀): nani like how
Bill: Elfriede gunna arrest her? Helping her hide?
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh you think trisp-ians will be like NON BELIEVER and elfriede will have to cover for her?
Bill: I think they'll assume she's a *spy* and try to *kill* her.
Bill: Or arrest her.
Afina (Georgia🍀): and he'll have reason to because 1. hes a good boi 2. he doesnt care as much as one would assume about eraia 3. afina could say she recognizes eliran, whos traveling with nokri, and elfriede could be like "well if theyre with AFINAS friend they must be ok"
Bill: Or call the guard.
Bill: Depending on whose doing to assuming.
Afina (Georgia🍀): and then nokri would be all MY KNIGHTY SAVIOR
Bill: You're on the right track.
Eliran (Halim): save nokri from kidnapping part 2
Eliran (Halim): save nokri from captivity part 2
Bill: eh, it doesn't have to go that far.
Bill: I'm not jumping on that one again either, Nokri's annoying to rescue.
Bill: But keep in mind societal interactions... I skipped over getting across the border because meeting up, but Nokri is in absolutely enemy territory.
Afina (Georgia🍀): table 1 could just be getting heckled
Afina (Georgia🍀): and eliran tries to talk around them
Afina (Georgia🍀): and afina sees and is like HEY I KNOW HIM
Afina (Georgia🍀): and elfies like HMPH and sets in like "hullo eraian patrol, these are guests of the eraian military unit that im in, we were separated, please pardon them"
Afina (Georgia🍀): and afrins like hullo eliran
Afina (Georgia🍀): and nokris like MY SAVIOR LET ME POLISH YOUR ARMOR WITH MY POTIONS O MIGHTY NOBLE MAN
Afina (Georgia🍀): boom done great scenario
Eliran (Halim): Eh i don't like it
Afina (Georgia🍀): _we cant always have kidnappings tho_
Eliran (Halim): i mean i was joking about the kidnapping
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean they could just stop to eat at the same place
Afina (Georgia🍀): but bills right, most people voted for more politics in the game, and nokris heritage hasnt been touched at ALL despite being in enemy territory
Eliran (Halim): no I know that
Eliran (Halim): but Table 1 shouldn't be that stupid
Afina (Georgia🍀): im not saying they ARE but like maybe the cloak nokris hiding under falls off
Bill: Eh, I mostly didn't make Callora antagonist to Nokri because I barely defined most of Callora (whoop).
Afina (Georgia🍀): or nokri is just _a little shit and gives herself away_
Afina (Georgia🍀): and table 1 is thereby dragged in with her ~~again~~
Eliran (Halim): you have a former member of the Drecan military, and a person who regularly travels in a caravan for trading 
Nokri's appearance is a known problem, they even think its why she was kidnapped
The idea that they just kinda waltz into such an obvious problem
Eliran (Halim): especially after the kidnapping
Eliran (Halim): it seems moronic
Aldus (Jess): "Hullo my names aldus, heres my drecian fren, and also can i pick some of these illegal to pick plants?"
Bill: Did I say illegal before?
Bill: I don't remember.
Aldus (Jess): early on
Aldus (Jess): like week one
Bill: Ah, yeah, go with whatever Desii said in that exposition blurb.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah theyre not stupid ofc
Afina (Georgia🍀): but things can always go wrong by bad luck
Afina (Georgia🍀): nokri drops the cloak, the wrong person sees, nokri steals something expensive cause she cant help herself
Bill: *why is Nokri the cause of all these*
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean we want this to be an easy meeting, if table 1 is taking a careful approach and sneaking around the exterior of the city what are elfie and fina gonna do to meet them?
Bill: snrk. Technically? She'd be busted in the bath house.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^ that could be it
Afina (Georgia🍀): like i know theres an element of logic here, but sometmes you just have to force it for the play by post to work
Bill: I'm willing to glaze over that plot hole though, cause that would involve nekkid shenanigans.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like afina inviting all of table 2 to travel with her early on
Bill: Yup. ^ good point.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like it didnt make sense for her to do that, and its completely out of character, but thats how the party had to be formed
Eliran (Halim): ~~its out of character because shes racist and never would have let atalantia come~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats not wrong lmao
Aldus (Jess): wait so is table 1 getting a bath scene orrrr?
Bill: If you want to?
Aldus (Jess): i mean, did we bathe?
Afina (Georgia🍀): it can be implied and glaze over it to get to tables meeting
Bill: diiiid you?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~afina and elfriede can only walk through town so slowly~~
Bill: I'm saying you can glaze over Nokri being discovered as drecian in the bath because I'm not forcing any scene involving nekkid characters. I ain't about that life.
Aldus (Jess): but you allready did
Aldus (Jess): i also want the tables to meet but i do feel like table 1 might be getting rushed a lil . but its kinda too late now
Bill: what do you want to slow down and do?
Bill: I'm fine with delaying it if you want to do something instead.
Aldus (Jess): its fine
Afina (Georgia🍀): Table 2 can stall
Afina (Georgia🍀): TIME 4 MORE HAND HOLDS
Bill: table-2 has multiple days in the monastery alone, and I can bullshit reasons to extend the visit. Expressing your opinion can only *help*, not saying anything does nothing.
Aldus (Jess): but thats the thing i dont have any ideas, it just feels unnatural to me.
Bill: meeting bbiab
Eliran (Halim): question
Bill: answer.
Eliran (Halim): I already had Eliran being a delivery boi with some letters
Eliran (Halim): why can't he just be delivering a letter to afina
Eliran (Halim): and boom
Eliran (Halim): tables meet
Bill: we wanted you to be independent of Afina as a character, so we were trying to keep you separated from the Tyndalls for the time being.
Eliran (Halim): yeah well we gave ulterior motives of being in Eraia, namely some form of tournament was the idea, and if I recall he has his own reasons to be there now
Its not like he's a personal mail man for the tyndalls, 
its like a favor 
and it doesn't throw table 1 into a damsel situation they should have seen coming since way before they crossed the border
plus if not mail for her, maybe something for the people at the church and they can run into eachother there
Bill: I'm find with mail for the church. However, it doesn't change the fact that Nokri's appearance will make her stand out.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: could have the tables meet involving nekkid <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: also Elfriede would indeed be weary of nokri, but not a moron about it
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~a complete moron~~
Eliran (Halim): Everybody meets in the shower
Aldus (Jess): "meet me in the bath house in 40 minutes for an ass kicking"
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's an idea that would work lol
