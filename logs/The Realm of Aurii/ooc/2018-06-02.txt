Eliran (Halim): so.... post day..?
Bill: Work and now I’m out to dinner. Tonight.
Eliran (Halim): 👍
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> switch your post to table-1 for clarity
Bill: Cause I gotta figure out the order of this nonsense.
Bill: Eliran knocking on the monastery door: https://daily-asgardian-news.tumblr.com/post/34583371948/penny-penny-penny
Bill: Ooooh, I'mma make Afrin pay for the *Simple Eraian is useless*
Afina (Georgia🍀): SHE DOES NOTE ITS CAUSE ITS WRITTEN BY A CALLORIAN
Afina (Georgia🍀): she said that back at the faun house
Afina (Georgia🍀): shes not _that_ much of a jerk
Bill: Still going to have some lecture being taught in Eraian and Afrin will be like 😐
Afina (Georgia🍀): O yeah she only speaks conversational like "hello how are you" so if they start talkin funny shit then shes screwed
Bill: you mean advanced theory and belief of light magic.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye funny shit
Bill: *Ironically religious lectures are probably pretty common as light magic training, because it's powered by faith*
Bill: Huh.
Bill: I love when my world surprises me.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yyuuuuuup
Afina (Georgia🍀): and fortunately afina has been able to skate by because of her faith in HERSELF as opposed to lololol
Afina (Georgia🍀): but thatll only carry her so far
Bill: Yet that's actually the best choice for a PC light magic user. It's really show cased light magic as not the magic of god.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye not god but faith
Afina (Georgia🍀): _how intriguing_
Bill: One day you'll have to figure out the secrets of magic.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _me or afrin_
Afina (Georgia🍀): afrin knows the faith thing, thats something that had to have come up as a little kiddo
Afina (Georgia🍀): with witella being all "you conjure based on lylalel" and shes like "no that sucks" and then little elementary school afrin is like i can do it WITHOUT that binch
Bill: ~~who said that's the secrets of magic~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): we dats probably one of them
Afina (Georgia🍀): not eeeeveryone knows that
Bill: Wait, so effectively Afina has been riding on childhood belief that "I can do it if I want to, nah!" for the last decade. That's so naive.
Bill: Like, you know what I mean? She said 'I can do it if I want to!' like a little kid would say about something impossible, *actually did it*, and now decades later she still can because of that childish faith in doing the impossibly.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yuuuup and shes a naive character so that logic WORKS for her
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean as shes gotten older shes also cocky about her schooling and such, so she also legitimately believes shes qualified to practice it
Bill: Boy I hope she doesn't have that pointed out to her, it'd kill her casting ability. 😱
Bill: It's adorable as a character trait.
Bill: Damn.
Bill: *It's also a ticking time bomb.*
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~thats also why she had trouble casting in the laguz fight because she was scared of the legos~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): hell YEAH IT IS WOOOOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!184437198865563648> is desii gonna say anything this round tho
Bill: Yeah, I'll write for her now.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeeet
Bill: whoop. I think I changed my mind.
Afina (Georgia🍀): huh
Bill: Good foreshadowing would be to give Eliran, Afina, and Desii a chance to see Enera. See, because Desii and Eliran would know the name. But no, I prefer it coming up in conversation and Afina/Elfriede revealing someone named Enera being at the monastery.
Afina (Georgia🍀): soooo no post from GM?
Bill: Yeah, I'll stick with no post.
Afina (Georgia🍀): kaaaay
Bill: Desii could easily piss Afrin off.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ooooo ya probably
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~and after the lego reveal she may very well replace elfriede's "best female friend" status~~
Bill: Desii got enough bois.
Bill: Nah, one of Desii's traits is a natural at everything. So she'd pick up light magic comparatively fast.
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina: SNORTS "do i know a ligHT MAGIC TEACHER HA"
Eliran (Halim): <@184437198865563648> we trying to deliver mail to the bishop boi named Dean...?
Eliran (Halim): Just as a heads up
Bill: He's a busy guy. I'd just say give it to him, or his like, underling or something.
Bill: And unless you have something other than the actual delivery to discuss with Dean, talking to him isn't really necessary.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah and afina cant leave elfriede alone for 5 minutes or hes gonna get lost
Bill: Pretttttty sure these are alternate mats for the table and those look like galaxy print. 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): :OOOO
Bill: for space combat games.
Afina (Georgia🍀): me as FUCK
Bill: Have you ever played a war game?
Afina (Georgia🍀): nooope
Bill: They're fun. Come over sometime and I'll teach you some. Any excuse to actually play the games Dad has down there.
Bill: Starfire (lol) happens to be one of my favorites, and it's a starship combat game. Also know star wars X-wing, which has miniatures and such.
Nokri (Marisa): Important question for the VN as I gather assets

Bill: ~~Desii is the hero of time~~
