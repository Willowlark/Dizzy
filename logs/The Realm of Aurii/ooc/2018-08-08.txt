Afina (Georgia🍀): Afrin needs to wake up cause i am getting so tired of not being able to post 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll go write some backstory, maybe Afina dreams about her childhood while shes KO
Bill: she can, if oyu want.
Afina (Georgia🍀): But she asleep!
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: Or, <@!301927856240459777> can have a sleep heal on hand.
Bill: Nokri catches up to Afrin/Elfriede, she shoos Elfie away, heals Afrin, the two rejoin.
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!301927856240459777> resurrect Afina when you get a chance lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll still write some backstory scenes tho, I'm lowkey inspired now
Bill: and everyone else, post up.
Bill: Namely, I'll have limited time to post tomorrow night so if I can post in the AM it'd be appreciated. @everyone
