Bill: I want Aurii started. Iâ€™d like to have writing for Aurii as a ~~distraction~~ time sink in my day to day. <@!351785752197201920> and <@!245270932602486784> seem ready, I believe <@!301927856240459777> knows how sheâ€™ll be at the party as well. <@!351471675843411978> you have your ideas mostly figured out afaik, so we just gotta cross check and should be good? You donâ€™t have a character sheet but w/e well do it when you need it. <@!386874959009415170> you need some one on one time to figure out Chengu from the sounds of it. <@!350847001937707022> are you coming back? <@!350855105123319808> do you want to try playing again? I know itâ€™s harder with your work schedule.
Bill: <@!334090409389195266> the offer for Kaio to be in is of course always open, but last I checked you were going to let me know when you felt ready to play with all the other things you had to do.
Bill: ~~the rest of you lurkers I assume will never be interested and are here for the memes, thatâ€™s fine~~
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): I can try and play again depending when the dates are and such. I just graduated so I'm a little bit more free atm
Bill: Youâ€™ve got quite a bit to catch up on. Course Erik is brand new so heâ€™s got more than you, so youâ€™re in good company.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): That's fine with me. Also I apologize for being quiet. Sometimes there's a lot of backlog and such so I can never tell if some mentions are towards me or not ðŸ˜…
Bill: No issues. I just poked fun at the lurkers, itâ€™s not really a problem. Though this is pretty much our only point of contact so hopefully you can find more time post grad to keep in touch. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 

That said, CONGRATS ON ESCAPING ROWAN
Bill: Where you situating yourself? In phili with Nick? Moving home?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye sorry I'm still gonna be out until further notice
Bill: No apologies needed.
