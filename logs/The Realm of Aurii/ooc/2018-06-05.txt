Eliran (Halim): Yes lets meet while he's confronting aldus and nokri
Eliran (Halim): Eliran gonna be like ho you trying to arrest us we have paperwork and shut
Bill: <@!351785752197201920>
Eliran (Halim): <@184437198865563648> ik  but Eliran  would be pointedly using their overly friendly customs to through elfriede off cause he knows the boi  can't _really_ do anything about it cause his bestie got his back
Eliran (Halim): Its like a light teasing that's more for Elirans fun than for being true to his customs
Bill: That’s fine, just saying how Theanovene operates.
Eliran (Halim): :+1:
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: No I don't have any plans
Eliran (Halim): _throws Elirsn into the aside_
Bill: Cool.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Soooo table combo?
Bill: suppose I should do that before bed.
Nokri (Marisa): Table 12
Nokri (Marisa): Rip table 12
Nokri (Marisa): If we get tables 3 and 4 active again can we form voltron
Bill: I didn't not make a typo, there is no 12.
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah you made 12 the head
Nokri (Marisa): Wow Alfredo you can’t just accuse people of being drecan based on looks that’s racist
Aldus (Jess): Table 1 "oh good the racists have arrived"
Afina (Georgia🍀): [john cena entrance music plays]
Nokri (Marisa): oh wait have the two tables officially met up yet? or are they still separate did I miss a post saying "everyone runs into everyone else"
am i able to keep posting in aside beforehand yolo
Eliran (Halim): is there any kind of like respectful way to greet somebody in Eraia
Eliran (Halim): like a kind of "by lylalels will" or something kind of thing
Nokri (Marisa): a subtle head nod and a "hey nerd"
Afina (Georgia🍀): wait why is that in aside 1
Afina (Georgia🍀): shouldnt eliran greet in the table merge
Eliran (Halim): why wouldn't it be in aside one
Eliran (Halim): still seems to be ongoing conversation and aside
Afina (Georgia🍀): i feel like their aside should at least close first then
Afina (Georgia🍀): idk seems messy to me
Nokri (Marisa): there's gonna be a continuous conversation, right? if the conversation continues it should be ok? but if everything turns into an awkward silence then table 1 maybe?

I think if we continue to converse it's ok and then once everyone moves or something bigger happens it can be done in table 1 (and we can briefly summarize what happened in the aside)
Nokri (Marisa): nokri be like "omg eliran my fake name was supposed to be a secret"
Eliran (Halim): did they decide that prior
Eliran (Halim): cause I can fix that if we say they did
Nokri (Marisa): the name? naw it's nokri being stubborn and annoying
Nokri (Marisa): if biru says it's too messy we can clean it up later
Eliran (Halim): i mean does she use a different name with Elfriede
Nokri (Marisa): OH no, she just didn't say her name at all
Eliran (Halim): oh good then you don't end up being an obvious liar at least
Bill: Enter in the head table. The aside needs to close.
Nokri (Marisa): I’ve thought of 2 VN endings for everyone except dizzy. What would be a good ending for dizzy.
Nokri (Marisa): I’ve got a bad ending for her
I’ll message y’all later with ideas for good and bad endings for each character or if y’all have endings you want send em on over
Nokri (Marisa): Unless y’all want to be surprised by your characters ~~I’m afraid of making them too OOC as a consequence of that~~
Aldus (Jess): 🙌
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 🙌
