Bill: where'd Nokri's name come from?
Nokri (Marisa): I dunno <:thinku:543194478614413318> I just know I googled it to make sure it wasn’t offensive or anything. I thiiink I took two random names from a fantasy name generator and combined half of each?
Bill: Gotcha.
Bill: Did I ever give Dreca theme colors?
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmm idk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): does each territory have its own colors?
Nokri (Marisa): I think I asked about military colors once
Bill: Remember what I said?
Bill: Only colors I associate with it are orange (due to the color on the map), red, and black.
Bill: ~~generic villain colors~~
Nokri (Marisa): No sowwy ;u; I’m lookin for the post but I can’t find it
Bill: mmkay.
Bill: I can always retcon if it comes up.
Bill: Green.
Bill: Fisher is growing on me for a name.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Good name
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Sam Fischer Price
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao it auto corrected the price but I'll leave it
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The child assassin
El🆓de Faun (Tom): With night vision goggles
Bill: Wyvern rider.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wyvern riding child assassin with night vision goggles
Aldus Larian (Jess): arnt drecans dark skinned?
Bill: Tanned, but the editor doesn't have a really tanned skin tone so.
Nokri (Marisa): it does!
Nokri (Marisa): i saw it when i was playing earlier
Bill: *Not one that fit what I wanted so*
Nokri (Marisa): too light?
Bill: too dark, I wanted between 2 and 3, and also does it matter?
Nokri (Marisa): you know how passionate we get about characters
Aldus Larian (Jess): i guess not i was just remembering what the world guide said
Bill: Sorry I'm probably getting defensive for no reason
Nokri (Marisa): we need to know everything about him or how else can we draw him
Bill: Still working on it.
Bill: Hahaha oooooh bad thought.
Bill: For Chengu.
Bill: Very bad.
Bill: I’ve said before the wyvern riders have done fox hunts with laguz slaves.
Bill: Bad: Fisher was involved on a fox hunt of Chengu
Worse: Fisher was involved in the fox hunt that killed his mom 
Worst: Killing Chengu’s mom is why Fisher deserts the Drecian army.
Bill: He’s a deserter no matter what but what an oof connection to pull out at a dramatic moment.
Bill: Also Nokri had something with wyvern riding in her background, refresh my memory? Thought: Fisher and her could have trained together but he got one and she didn’t so she hate now.
Nokri (Marisa): nokri worked a stint at a wyvern hatching facility
Bill: There’s potential for something in that. 🤔
Bill: (Assuming you are also on board with creating a connection)
Nokri (Marisa): ye if it fits in and makes sense with her character
Bill: That’s why we work together on it. ☺️
Bill: As a soldier on the other side of the war he has a basis for communicating with Elfie, i wonder if I can come up with an organic connection between him and Aldus too...
Bill: Maybe Aldus, while being all Robin Hood in Thenovene, helped the recent deserter broke Fisher and Fisher never got to repay the debt or something...
Bill: (All optional for every character, I just like making “wow small world huh” part of character creation)
Bill: Nokri sew? ~~I assume since she your character~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Was it a fox hunt that destroyed Kisselain? Also, Chengu's dad was killed, his mom was taken as a slave
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and is "allegedly" still alive
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hence why Chengu is willing to do Dreca's bidding
Bill: And if he finds out she’s dead he can go on a revenge rampage <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: The kissealain territories aren’t so much destroyed as occupied. Dreca landed on the main land there and the newly founded area was easy to overtake between air support and superior numbers, arms. 

The fox hunting is more like when a unit is stationed at base they exercise wyverns by releasing a slave into the plains and give them a head start before they go after them.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh gotcha. well I kind of already have Chengu's backstory set up differently
Bill: I don’t think anything for Chengu himself will change. It just defines what happened to his Mom after he started working for Dreca. That said, she could have escaped and Fisher can confirm she’s alive or something, if you were beholden to her being alive.
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri can probably military sew, like repair stuff in a pinch but nothing intricate. Only what’s needing for sewing skin back together. Her parents were both doctors as well and they pushed that all onto her.
Nokri (Marisa): If chengu finds out information about his mother this early it seems like it’ll ruin his motivation
Bill: Oh it doesn’t have to come up till dramatically appropriate.
Bill: Chengu is describing his moms beautiful eyes and Fisher is like “frick”
Bill: (Just explaining how it fits, not forcing$
Bill: Okee, his father being a tailor probably isn’t a good way to bond then.
Nokri (Marisa): me @ me: what if.......................... i tried making a new quest 👀
also me @ me: lol u can't do that.
the third me: *but what if*
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT IF
Nokri (Marisa): haha what if
Nokri (Marisa): haha
Nokri (Marisa): <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Nokri (Marisa): ~~if anyone would be interested react now or forever hold your peace~~
~~if no one is interested that's a-ok~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OFC we interested yo
Nokri (Marisa): *but what if not*
Nokri (Marisa): i have made
*a poll*
