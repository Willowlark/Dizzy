Eliran (Halim): Just table 1 og check
Eliran (Halim): Nobody told any of table 2 that Nokri was almost kidnapped and killed at the border right
Eliran (Halim): I assumed as much but wanna make sure
Bill: Desii didn't bring it up.
Elfriede (Tom): I'm pretty sure that's a no
Elfriede (Tom): I don't remember anyone saying anything to Elfriede
Elfriede (Tom): He was trying to inquire why she looked banged up and dirty
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or Afina either nah
Elfriede (Tom): But never got an answer
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina: oh my god you let one of your party get kidnapped!? How dare!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede: uh... Fina... Atalantia was...
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina: ... forgot about that one
Elfriede (Tom): :3c
Elfriede (Tom): Where is she right now actually? In canon?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Traveling separately was last I heard
Elfriede (Tom): Yeee, I guess they just parted ways after the boat
Eliran (Halim): She got kidnapped that's just what they tell themselves
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: casually mentions the potential of Eraians attacking or harming Afina
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: casually walks over next to his bow and arrow
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's like the Aurii equivalent of a father polishing his gun while talking to his daughter's boyfriend
Eliran (Halim): Lowkey was gonna have him fiddle with an arrow but thought it may be a little heavy handed
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran: constantly wants to talk to Elfriede for info but also wants to let him know not to fuck with Afina
Eliran (Halim): I mean this is also like
Eliran (Halim): "Do I tell the Eraian soldier that his country is kidnapping innocents which could easily start a war"
Eliran (Halim): Or nah
Aldus (Jess): How does Eliran know that tho?
Eliran (Halim): I mean eliran doesn't know
Eliran (Halim): But to him its p obvious from context
Eliran (Halim): You had eraian fanatic bandits kidnapping young girls
Eliran (Halim): One recently kidnapped one is named Enera
Eliran (Halim): Accordijg to the almanac, eraia has declared they have a new genius mage in training
Eliran (Halim): And low and behold
Eliran (Halim): My old friend says theres a young girl named Enera
Eliran (Halim): Like 
It's not 100% definite
Eliran (Halim): But hes pretty sure that's what's going on
Aldus (Jess): Hmm ok
Bill: sure, and misinformation makes for really good twists, but there was no direct link to Eraia with the guy in white.
Eliran (Halim): Yeah ik 
Elirans view is based on a few assumptions, that's why he is tiptoeing a bit
But he also feels confident that's what's going on
1. Assuming Eneras are the same 
2. Assuming the Bandits were the same ones that got Enera
3. Assuming white boyo was one link between eraia and them 
To name a few
Eliran (Halim): But he also shares a negative view of Eraia (and dreca tbh) as countries 
He thinks they both would stoop to the lowest means for their causes, 
Eraia more so because of the fanaticism (which is how he views their 'crusades') 
Boi doesn't like countries that wage war
