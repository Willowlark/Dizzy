Eliran (Halim): I just realized Eliran actually introduced himself for the first time
Eliran (Halim): like his full name and status
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause normally he dont give a shit
Eliran (Halim): but right now he's princess friendo so formalities and stuff
Nokri (Marisa): O tru. is it too late to react to that maybe
Eliran (Halim): nah
Eliran (Halim): Nokri hasn't had a chance to react to Eliran or Afina's intros yet so you could react to both
Afina (Georgia🍀): GO FORTH NOKRI
Nokri (Marisa): nokri rn
Eliran (Halim): Nokri: finally realizes why Eliran is able to pay for them all and easily ride with random caravans
Afina (Georgia🍀): "ELIRAN YOU DIDNT SAY YOUR FRIEND IS LOADED"

Nokri (Marisa): ~~oops thats long~~
Aldus (Jess): I'm really tired 😴
Nokri (Marisa): wake up jess cheritz just released 3 new announcements
Eliran (Halim): "Is that why he knows so many people? Not because he sleeps around all the time?"

Afina (Georgia🍀): #everyone was thinking it
Afina (Georgia🍀): nokri plz
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats too good
Nokri (Marisa): "hey mr cantaret my bff my buddy my bro"
she was so shocked she forgot to introduce herself whoops
Afina (Georgia🍀): whoops edit it in real fast
Eliran (Halim): I like the slow thought process "hey nice lie" 
"wait don't go to far jeez"
"Wait shit is he serious"
"I guess he doesn't just sleep his way into fortune"
Nokri (Marisa): the next night nokri goes through all his stuff to find his id papers and/or money
Eliran (Halim): best part
they crossed the border using his ID papers and associated paperwork
Eliran (Halim): but Nokri didn't notice cause she didn't want to cause issues with border patrol
Nokri (Marisa): "Hello, princess. *If that is your real title,* your majesty."
Afina (Georgia🍀): i would have afina react with ~~confused but aroused~~ surprised but thankful sentiment
Afina (Georgia🍀): but ill wait a bit
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: tbh theres really nothing more for the aside besides a bit of back and forth, everything else can prob go in next post
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *after the go and eat wherever the hell they are going*
Afina (Georgia🍀): they gotta eat somewhere nice and lively
Afina (Georgia🍀): and full of food that nokri can ~~steal~~
Nokri (Marisa): nokri asks to borrow a bag from someone
nokri puts a whole turkey in the bag when she thinks no one is looking
Afina (Georgia🍀): shes just nomming on it later while theyre all moseying about the monastery
Afina (Georgia🍀): afina is mid-spell "where did you get that"
Nokri (Marisa): "i was granted this wonderous gift by lylalol for my dedication to religion and whatnot"
Afina (Georgia🍀): afinas like fuck it i dont believe in lololol either but dont tell these guys that
Nokri (Marisa): a good way to get half the turkey
Afina (Georgia🍀): nokris like: i think were gonna be good ~~business partners~~ friends
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Is the aside wrapped up, or do people have anything to add?
Aldus (Jess): Uhhh I can?
Aldus (Jess): It's not necessary though since Aldus is basically useless in this situation
Nokri (Marisa): Would be nice to get his input
Aldus (Jess): Ok need coffees first though
Aldus (Jess): Maybe I can think of something more creative then "aldus is awkward and feels out of place"
Aldus (Jess): "wtf why do all these people have fancy titles?"
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri and aldus have a telepathic conversation
“*dude did you know about this??*”
Aldus (Jess): RIGHT omg
Aldus (Jess): i think im gonna go full misplaced foreigner like "is this how your people settle disputes? with food?"
Aldus (Jess): Naissankari just sounds like Nissan Car-y
Aldus (Jess): wolf laguz drive Nissans its canon
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YEAH
Aldus (Jess): does aldus know nkris drecan? XD or did she tell him shes theonovene?
Aldus (Jess): Me: "wow everyone wrote so much I'm intimidated"
*proceeds to write almost just as much*
"opps"
Nokri (Marisa): Hmmm. She’s used a Drecan accent in front of him but I don’t think she’s ever outright said it? Does he know what Drecan sounds like.
Nokri (Marisa): If he asked her she’d be like “oh yeah no I’m def Theonowhatever”
Aldus (Jess): maybbeeee? probably not
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): welp that got way out of hand, RIP
Aldus (Jess): i spent an entire hour on that omg
Bill: I'll toss something in for Desii, but I have nothing meaningful.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao I love how that last react is called okwoman
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'm surprised Afrin had nothing to say about the Dessi Elfriede interaction, but it didn't really get all that gay so understandable
Bill: *It's literally the opposite of gay*
Eliran (Halim): Did.. aldus think eliran was being expedient en route to fucking elfriede/afina ...?
Aldus (Jess): no what why does it seem that way?!
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: No I didn't get that
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Aldus thought that eliran may have had a quicky with a lego
Eliran (Halim): Yeah that's what I was thinking about 
Except it was at the same time as the wondering about Afina and Elfriede
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like hey if they are dating then why does one of the smell funny
Eliran (Halim): Wait eliran is here it could just be him
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Exactly so Aldus is convinced it's one or the other
Eliran (Halim): Side note 
Considering Nokri and Alduss view of Eliran as a boi who ducks a lot
Eliran (Halim): How many people did he fuck on the way to Eraia o.o
Aldus (Jess): Aldus is like "one of these 3 ppl slept with a lego, eliran has been out of my sight for like 20 mins so it prob not him but i guess it could be"
Eliran (Halim): Cause they're both like "look he went to go hook up like always"
Nokri (Marisa): inb4 he didn't at all but it became a running joke
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Some the fuck how eliran is a virgin
Nokri (Marisa): eliran wanders off into the woods to use the bathroom
"wow there he goes on another fling"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Wowwee the mix-up
Eliran (Halim): Everyone assumes hes fucking a bunch of people
Eliran (Halim): But he actually is saving himself for marriage
Eliran (Halim): And is somehow completely unaware of the rumors
Aldus (Jess): whoesome
Eliran (Halim): Lol 
But nah eliran gets around
Eliran (Halim): He likes experiencing life to much not to :lenny:
Aldus (Jess): *the wanderer starts playing in the background*
Aldus (Jess): cant wait for Aldus to tell Afina that Elfriede is cheating on her, or vice versa
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOOOOO
Aldus (Jess): actually that would be great before lego reveal
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah I'mma figure out something for modern au Elfriede, I'm taking notes now ~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I feel like Elfriede would be track swim or tennis
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I kinding leaning towards track and swim.
Bill: Elfriede is *so* Tennis.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: (mostly swim cuz I want a reason to draw Elfriede shirtless)
Bill: it's done by rich people, all white clothes, involves singing around a stick...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: All three
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: What a try hard
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I coullld also see soccer
Afina (Georgia🍀): I see the tennis too
Afina (Georgia🍀): _the clean BOI sport_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeahh.. let's go with tennis and swim for now
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aside good to close?

Bill: EH, go ahead.
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!184437198865563648> it still post day?
