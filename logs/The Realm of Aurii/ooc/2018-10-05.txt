Bill: <@&358049600172589067> Any objection to clearing out the gameplay tables? We're not going to use them when we restart, and they're completely logged.

Bill: ~~throw back to when I was going to number every round~~
Aldus (Jess): Yea that's fine
Afina (Georgia): Agreed
Bill: Tom?
Aldus (Jess): He don't care
