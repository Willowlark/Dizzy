Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Standing in her undergarments, Afina Tyndall inspected herself in the mirror with a frown. The changing of the seasons had not worn well on her physique. Any muscle she had accumulated from her travels had worn away, and her time indoors had left her strikingly pale. She pushed her chest upwards with her hands, noting how her loss of appetite had served to further reduce her weight. The princess’ eyes trailed down her body, catching a glimpse of the jagged white scar that cut across her hip. Afina hugged herself, looking away from the reflection in the mirror. 

“You seem displeased, princess,” the redheaded seamstress observed, cocking her head and lowering the bolt of fabric she had been inspecting a moment before.

“I’m… having a difficult time grappling with my desirability, Myrti,” Afina said slowly, articulating her thoughts as she found words to describe them. 

“Oh, Lady Tyndall!” Myrti exclaimed, a sly grin appearing across her face. The petite woman waltzed to the other side of the room, grabbing a bundle of white cloth from a nearby table. “How could such a pretty princess struggle with beauty, my lady?”

Afina tucked a stray hair behind her ear, her gaze averting that of her lively assistant. “It’s not that. I want to be worth the attention, is all,” Afina stated. Images of a bedroom in Eraia and a caramel-haired lover flashed through the princess’ mind. She blinked the thought away. “But I do not want to sacrifice my intelligence and strength to be thought of as so. It seems I am grappling with my image. As a woman, a princess, a scholar, and so on.”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Ahhh~,” Myrti cooed, throwing the bundle of fabric over Afina’s head. “A shame that a princess should have to deal with such negative thoughts. You’re quite beautiful already, Lady Afina.” Afina shooed her assistant aside, electing to don the rest of her garments herself. 

“Really, Lady Tyndall, I curse the man that finds no love in your bed,” Myrti said flatly, resting a hand on her own distended torso. Afina eyed her carefully; To her recollection, Myrti was a few moon cycles along in her childbearing. And the same age as Afina. The princess looked away, forcing herself not to stare. 

Myrti continued. “In fact, I curse any man that rejects you with the pain of a thousand sins. May his tomes burn before he is ready to cast, may his words fail him when he seeks to address a crowd, may his undergarments be infested with mites that never cease to bite at his--.”
“Myrti!” Afina chastised, though she couldn’t help but smile. 

“Sorry, princess. What I mean to say is, you look lovely in your new traveling clothes, if I do say so myself.” Myrti stepped forward to pin the insignia of the Callorian alliance to Afina’s chest. “Truly, perfect in every way.”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Thank you, Myrti. I appreciate that you took the time to rework the design of my traveling garments. As you can see, my other set returned in less than impeccable condition. I am blessed to have such a devoted seamstress. May all my efforts as princess serve to help you and your family.” Afina braced her hand on the back of Myrti’s head, and gingerly kissed the smaller woman on the forehead. 

Myrti bowed as the princess turned to leave. “Of course, Lady Afina. Do enjoy yourself with Sir Kieron today! May your fox hunting together be plentiful, or may there be none at all, such that you must resort to a romp in the forest to entertain each other!” 

The door to the spinning room closed behind the Laeran princess, and though she smiled at Myrti’s good-natured energy, Afina felt a pit in her stomach. The Festival of Light was a mere moon cycle away, and here she was wasting time with the son of a Councilmember. _No, Afina_, she told herself. _You deserve this, and this is what you should be doing._ She sighed. _If nothing, such an excursion would prove to be a valuable time to practice the darker magics, at least._
