Eliran (Halim): Night billll
Nokri (Marisa): “There was no Nokri”
She just fades into the chair and stops existing hehehe
Bill: Okay.
Bill: I have a vague idea of direction for next scenes, but chime in with opinions.
Bill: Desii will follow up with Afina in my post, to solidify the Enera lead. Next day, Afina and Torin will have a train session, Desii's going to want to try and find out more about Enera.
Bill: (I drafted this message 3 hours ago whoops)
Bill: Desii not going to be able to see Enera, which will frustrate her and she'd lean on table 1 for help if they're willing to assist. I don't know what other characters want to do in the mean time.
Aldus (Jess): im not caught up just yet but Aldus does want to help with whatever
Bill: Ye, that'd be good.
Bill: ~~start revving those ships~~
Aldus (Jess): ship(s)?
Bill: I figure shipping will be abound.
Bill: ~~Also no one wants to end up stuck with Nokri so fight over Desii~~
Aldus (Jess): what color eyes does desii have?
Bill: blue eyes.
Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/12/20/desii-backstory.html
Aldus (Jess): all the girls got blue eyes
Aldus (Jess): i thought they were but i was unsure
Afina (Georgia🍀): ALL GIRLS
Afina (Georgia🍀): every girl in the world
Afina (Georgia🍀): all of aurii
Bill: Desii just *happens* to be cute okay, totally coincidental.
Aldus (Jess): ~~what is that supposed to mean?~~
Bill: feels like you were poking fun at blue eyes being a cute thing or something?
Aldus (Jess): oh no lol
Aldus (Jess): i just found it funny that all the people with female characters picked blue
Bill: Huh. Go figure.
Bill: ~~Desii doesn't have blond hair, so much more originally than this blonde hair blue eye girls~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~its almost as if blue eyes are seen as the elite~~
Bill: ~~Now you throwin shade at de blue eyes~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): FIRST OF ALL
Afina (Georgia🍀): afinas family is blue themed, and shes light themed
Afina (Georgia🍀): i couldnt not do blonde and blue eyed
Bill: ~~She's not just racist you?~~ 😛
Afina (Georgia🍀): I would never be as smart and angry as Afrin
Bill: Are you calling yourself dumb?
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah
Afina (Georgia🍀): afrin just mad smart
Afina (Georgia🍀): _she knows conversational levels of Eraian_
Bill: ~~Afrin an idiot~~
Bill: Naive would be the *correct* term, but.
Afina (Georgia🍀): UH YEAH shes genius about like everything else
Afina (Georgia🍀): but shes dumb to the Real World
Afina (Georgia🍀): when do i get my "everyone loves desii" tho
Bill: ?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i wanna see everyone be like "yeah i have a crush on desii"
Afina (Georgia🍀): even desii
Bill: Desii is too dense to crush on herself.
Afina (Georgia🍀): desii celebrity crushes on afina :V
Bill: ~~Desii doesn't know who Afina is~`
Afina (Georgia🍀): _they talked_
Aldus (Jess): why u think afina so great erryone gonna fall in love with her after meeting her once?
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah just desii
Afina (Georgia🍀): and more in a "light magic senpai" sense
Aldus (Jess): y tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~because my mind can only think in tropes cries~~
Bill: Desii isn't *that* into learning light magic.
Afina (Georgia🍀): desii was givin mad kohai vibes
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe it was just afrin
Bill: Desii's kinda moe trash.
Bill: So Afrin may have just fallen for her. 😛
Eliran (Halim): Eliran would not be interested in Desii
Aldus (Jess): Billy and I only made opposite gender charactersso we should make our ideal husbando/waifu
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~thats not what aldus is~~
Aldus (Jess): Wow you have so much faith in me
Eliran (Halim): Only person I could see him properly shipped with would potentially Aldus.
Desii is to clutzy and 
childish? 
Nokri is to sneaky and asshole-y 
Afrin is super friend
Elfriede is Afrins boi toy 
Bro code says don't date your friends date
Eliran (Halim): and Aldus is a stretch cause they bow bros first
Bill: ~~That’s not what Desii is~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): _white hair jess, white hair_
Afina (Georgia🍀): i know da weakness
Aldus (Jess): That's exactly what desii and Aldus are
Aldus (Jess): Lmao everyone know da weakness fren

Afina (Georgia🍀): and we're trying to make him not racist
Afina (Georgia🍀): like he opens his mouth and the rest of the family goes 👀
Afina (Georgia🍀): and he learns to be a better noodle
Aldus (Jess): If you don't have a racist family member, are you even white?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's true
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~cept my entire family is racist but ya know~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): toms SUPER white :V
Afina (Georgia🍀): oooh nevermind i have southern family
Afina (Georgia🍀): im pretty white too
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'd look more white it it weren't for my father, his existing family is super white but his father (who died and we have no contact with his family) looks that lil bit not white
Eliran (Halim): i have a grand-aunt on my mothers side that has no problems at all with black people
