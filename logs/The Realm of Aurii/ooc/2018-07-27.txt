Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Eliran (Halim): so we need to like finish combat then flee
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede goes back and tears the other guys throat out. Oh fuck now. I've done it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina wakes up: "I understand once, BUT TWICE?"
Elfriede (Tom): Ya know never coming back to Eraia sounds pretty good right about now what do you say guis
Elfriede (Tom): -Faun after killing two priests probably
Afina (Georgia🍀): But elfies Eraian 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): So internal conflict
Elfriede (Tom): "ya know I heard Dreca is lovely this time of year"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfies lost his GF, now he's gonna lose his home country
Afina (Georgia🍀): What is there LEFT TO LOSE
Afina (Georgia🍀): HE DOESNT EVEN LOSE THE THINGS HE WANTS TO LOSE :Len ny:
Elfriede (Tom): "Message for Elfriede faun!"
 Opens it and it's just a letter that says Yurias dead.
Elfriede (Tom): I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's probably what nokri would say
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfie: I lost everything
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri: not EVERTHING
Afina (Georgia🍀): anyways so yeah what's table 2 to do
Elfriede (Tom): Wiggles eyebrows mischievous
Elfriede (Tom): Nokri not me, I feel like i should clarify
Elfriede (Tom): 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh I thought that was in reference to my comment
Afina (Georgia🍀): I was gonna say they can do anything except each other
Afina (Georgia🍀): And apparently use a hand
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao yes PERFECT TIMING FOR A TUMBLE IN THE SHEETS
Afina (Georgia🍀): They come back to table 1 and Eliran's like "you sorted out your differences? You got over the laguz thing THAT fast"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina's like "yeah we talked it out"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then she leans in and whispers "_with our bodies_"
Eliran (Halim): "Bullshit you hate fucked didn't you"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus calls it out bY SMELLING THEM
Eliran (Halim): Eliran calls them out by looking at them
Eliran (Halim): cause they traded clothes and its hilarious
Elfriede (Tom): Aldus like ... Smells sex .. smells blood...
Elfriede (Tom): Riases an eyebrow
Afina (Georgia🍀): IMFG I DIDNT EVEN CONSIDER THAT
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede and Afina would have to be pretty fucked  up not to realize they swapped clothes
Afina (Georgia🍀): You don't just accidentally put on a chestplate
Elfriede (Tom): Afina is prob that level.of fucked up rn,now for Elfriede
Afina (Georgia🍀): Halfway there 🙌
Afina (Georgia🍀): Where's my Elfriede in Laeran blue dress fanart
Aldus (Jess): I have questions for Billiam in the morning
Bill: I cannot explain your husband wearing a blue dress and smelling like he bathed in blood and sex.
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede and Afina got some wierd kinks
Aldus (Jess): aldus steps away from elfy and afina, he dont wanna be next
Bill: > What turns you on babe
> The smell of a fresh kill and wearing your blood stained clothes
> fuck you're hot
Aldus (Jess): DAMN
Aldus (Jess): ~~now thats kinky~~
Bill: > San: What turns you on babe
> Ashitaka: The smell of a fresh kill and wearing your blood stained clothes
> San: fuck you're hot
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING
Bill: Afina?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hawt
Elfriede (Tom): Oo that's a really nice art
Bill: what happened to Elfie would have started disarmed?
Bill: `He remembered the nights they shared in a flash, bonding` I read that as flesh.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😏
Bill: also what happened to him needing a healer?
Aldus (Jess): also head tables just had a wall fall down?
Aldus (Jess): is that correct?
Bill: yeah. The outer wall.
Aldus (Jess): thats loud
Aldus (Jess): like everyone in the building would have heard it
Bill: YUP.
Bill: If Elfriede is still going to rush to find Nokri to cure the poison (bad decisions are made under duress) I'd like to time it that while he's running there the battle starts.
Bill: Otherwise he'll have to hear it from the room.
Aldus (Jess): ah
Aldus (Jess): lego transform 2.0
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH THATS GOOD THO if we want the rest of the peeps to find out too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Then Afina doesn't have to spread the info like a gossiping hoodlum
Bill: ... why would he transform again?
Aldus (Jess): it wasnt really a serious thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): He did grab his sword yee so he's armed now
Bill: > Nokri: I need three things to cure this poison. 
> Nokri: I have the mugwort root and yowl grass.
> Nokri: But I need ~~that guys eye~~ hair from a wolf laguz. Transformed, so dog boy is useless.
> Nokri *looks at Elfriede*
> Nokri: Chop chop.
Bill: Nokri is now canonically Rocket Raccoon.
Aldus (Jess): allthough i still wished everyone could know without "oh hey elfredies a wolf"
Bill: ?
Aldus (Jess): i was continueing my though from before. i dont like the whole afina having to tell everyone thing
Bill: I agree.
Bill: Petty whiny princess bitches about ~~boyfriend~~ bodyguard.
Aldus (Jess): i thought we wee going to somehow be brought into their scene
Bill: If he doesn't transform for combat, when she wakes up she can storm off and leave Elfriede to explain what happened. Then Elfriede has to relive the memory ~~and suffer~~.
Aldus (Jess): i also feel like afina wouldnt tell everyone, since she barely knows them, just eliran. and eliran wouldn't tell cuz its a close friendss business. I feel like its not really if elfriedes character to explain to a bunch of strangers either?
Aldus (Jess): obviously what they do is up to Georgia and Tom but those are just my thoghts
Bill: Nokri: *has a moment of feminine comradery*
Nokri: *Ignores it and realizes she can get in good with the princess by pretending to care*
Nokri: "You explain what happened to her or I won't heal her"
Aldus (Jess): tru
Aldus (Jess): also good opportunity for desii and nokri to work together on something
Aldus (Jess): ~~and for aldus to sit there twiddling his thumbs~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh yeah that's good!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri could be all "do you see this, Afina and I are both wearing blue, were bonded for life, you have to tell me what happened"
Aldus (Jess): but also if someone is dying are you going to save them or ask questions? i mean it is nokri but
Aldus (Jess): i mean after the saving questions could be asked
Aldus (Jess): eliran could get mad and demand answers too
Aldus (Jess): *tries to jam self into relevancy, fails*
Elfriede (Tom): Oooof
Aldus (Jess): in response to?
Elfriede (Tom): Everything
Aldus (Jess): theres alot to sort out now cuz we have 2 things going on at once in the same place
Elfriede (Tom): I feel as though Elfriede is going to feel in over his head and look for Eliran
Elfriede (Tom): Since he's the only other link to then princess
Aldus (Jess): well theres the matter of an entire wall falling down, elfys gonna hear that
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause he thinks Eliran might be able to help?
Elfriede (Tom): Ye, plus Elfriede feels as though princess won't wanna see him if she wakes
Elfriede (Tom): (Obviously)
Afina (Georgia🍀): IF she wakes
Afina (Georgia🍀): Not when
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😂
Aldus (Jess): wouldnt he try to find a healer first though
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah but what healer is gonna listen
Elfriede (Tom): Of he killed the fucking bishop
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri and Desii healers tho!
Aldus (Jess): if some gets hurt you call an ambulance they dont typically ask questions when someone is dying
Bill: What healer is going to listen when he shows up with the fantasy equivalent of a date rape victim.
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede doesn't know that thooo
Bill: Torin was supposed to be a creep, but Morras wasn't. Poor guy, you really can't take the priest out of a pedo,
Afina (Georgia🍀): OMG DATE RAPE VICTIM YOURE NOT WRING THO
Afina (Georgia🍀): What bout the healers in their party tho
Bill: They know Elfriede, it'd be fine. But like, it's a sketchy look.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah but what I'm saying is Elfriede doesn't know they are healere
Bill: You could go to the Cardinal.
Bill: He's the nice old guy who invited you here at all.
Bill: course then you'd find him trying to murder your friends.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oops
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also he could find Eliran and Eliran knows nokri and Desii are healers
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah exactly
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's a good plan then
