Bill: Go ahead and roll up for the round folks, posts are fully in.
Eliran (Halim): eliran go full attack cause he angry boi
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill i adjusted my post cause you said light doesn't cancel light .-.
Nokri (Marisa): I am still very confused about dice. Does that roll just now use all my dice ~~zero successes WOO~~
Eliran (Halim): YAY ONE HIT
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm confuse
Bill: Results block is at the end of my posts from monday.
Bill: You haven't rolled Marisa.
Eliran (Halim): ya know 1 hit out of 6
Eliran (Halim): is statistically accurate
Eliran (Halim): considering i got 1 forceful
Eliran (Halim): neet
Bill: Georgia, you can't attack him nor help Enera cause in your last post you did nothing related to those.
Eliran (Halim): what does she use the dice for
Eliran (Halim): then
Eliran (Halim): can she save them for later?
Bill: Defense. Which yes, is pointless, as Morras didn't attack her.
Afina (Georgia🍀): See I always thought dice were for the next round
Afina (Georgia🍀): Because I wouldn't write a post without knowing how the attack goes
Bill: Yes, This combat is an experiment for carry over dice.
Afina (Georgia🍀): /throws actual dice at the Cardinal to end this all
Aldus (Jess): So I didn't attack big meanie so no dice there, and he didn't attack me either so I can only use dice for enera right?
Bill: Technically you can defend anyway.
Aldus (Jess): But is there a point?
Bill: Nope. Dropping the constant one damage may be a mistake.
Bill: We’ll see.
Aldus (Jess): What is the Enera goal at anyway?
Eliran (Halim): i don't think the constant 1 damage is part of the problem 
theres no mooks so we shouldn't be taking damage unless its directed at us 
Are there any other goals we can aim at
Bill: 3, it’s listed in the block.
Afina (Georgia🍀): It sucks that being in character clashes with combat too, like Afina can't do much but this fight is gonna drag on otherwise
Bill: Then don’t be directly involved with combat?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Then I'm not even playing and it's not fun
Eliran (Halim): can she roll to  lower the cardinals need to fight
Eliran (Halim): like dissuade him or something
Bill: Yes, she can.
Afina (Georgia🍀): But realistically the Cardinal isn't gonna listen to her
Eliran (Halim): yeah but it doesn't matter if your roll succeeds
Eliran (Halim): right?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Okay then I put 6 dice to dissuading him to fight?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll go back to rewrite again
Bill: You don’t know what the cardinal is thinking. Any argument you make could be the one to go dissuade him.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll just make my new post now then I guess
Bill: Sure.
Elfriede (Tom): I thought you could end conflicts without attacking tho
Elfriede (Tom): So like you could verbally.try to end the conflict.and that would go e you dice theoretically
Bill: Yea exactly what she going to do.
Bill: As I was about [-----   ] close to puppy kicking before impromptu garage cleaning, there will be no magic secrets tongiht.
Aldus (Jess): Lul wut
Bill: Sounds like someone missed a chat room.
Aldus (Jess): You're cleaning your garage at 11 at night?
Bill: Stat block is up; Enera goal has been met so she got her resolve. Marisa, if you want to write you tackling the both of you off the side, please do and I'll hold off Enera's actions till then.
Nokri (Marisa): it'll be like one of the times in princess tutu where mytho falls out of the window without pants on
Nokri (Marisa): do that work
Bill: That was fast.
Nokri (Marisa): i gots needles on my keyboard
Bill: Sure. That doesn't have to be your whole post, you can post fully later as you wish.
Nokri (Marisa): nokri just doin what she want she go with the flow
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!184437198865563648> is the Cardinal meant to be kill-able?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause this leaves Afina, Elfriede, and a weaken Eliran to fight him r/n
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause they COULD abscond but also fight and if he's fight-able then I'll make that part of my post
Bill: He could be. He’s strong though.
