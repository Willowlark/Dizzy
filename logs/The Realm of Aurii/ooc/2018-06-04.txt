Bill: 
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: **dayyum**
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~daaaaamn afrin~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~slayyy~~
Eliran (Halim): so guys 
I think the tables should as is 
that way, the legu reveal never happens 
And Knight Light lives on as a fond memory 
instead of a hard core betrayal
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~whos the betrayer~~
Eliran (Halim): Yes
Afina (Georgia🍀): _thats not an answer_
Afina (Georgia🍀): **who betrays who in the lego reveal**
Eliran (Halim): Elfriede Betrays Afina's expectations
Eliran (Halim): Afina thinks he betrayed her trust
Eliran (Halim): Afina actually betrays Elfriede by being a dick to a good friend
Aldus (Jess): SO <@!301927856240459777>  <@!351785752197201920>  should we like aside or something?
Nokri (Marisa): nokri kicks alfredo in the shins and runs away
Aldus (Jess): NICE
Nokri (Marisa): i can aside if we do one
Nokri (Marisa): aldus and nokri just start having a private conversation and talking about elfriede while he's standing right there in front of them
Aldus (Jess): "who the hell is this guy? got a funny looking purple coat."
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: He got a cloak of some sort now, it cold
Aldus (Jess): "this bitch thinks its cold? i lived in wynne! this aint NOTHIN"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Rios shirt off
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: New au,Aldus can't keep his shirt on
Aldus (Jess): ~~get your twilight bs outta here~~
Nokri (Marisa): nokri screams "stranger danger" 3 times at the top of her lungs and then runs away
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: "Bella.. I'm contractually obligated to take my shirt off every 10minutes of screen time"
Bill: "*Yes, I stipulated that clause in mine, I know."*
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I post an aside response in in momento
Aldus (Jess): ah yes the busy streets of marketing
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ofc it kicked me out of discord tooo
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: So I couldn't fix it
Aldus (Jess): lols is ok i just found it funny
Afina (Georgia🍀): _elfriede you sounding like a creep PLEASE_
Nokri (Marisa): try offering some candy
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Please just ~~get in my abduction van~~ come with me"
Aldus (Jess): "hey kids wanna go to church?"
Aldus (Jess): ok but for real why does elfriede want them to go so bad?
Bill: *He's bringing the obvious Drecian to an area he can make an easy arrest in*
Aldus (Jess): is that it tom?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Partially yeah
Aldus (Jess): hmm...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: He is concerned about her but is also...... Concerned she's here
Aldus (Jess): RIP
Aldus (Jess): aldus doesn't understand racism so
Bill: Tru, he wouldn't.
Bill: There's little to none in Wynne.
Bill: How interesting.
Aldus (Jess): like hes weary cuz of the whole pulled a sword on him thing but hes have no idea about elfie having ulterior motives
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow Aldus is like Nega-Afina
Afina (Georgia🍀): No idea what racism is
Nokri (Marisa): so pure
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like this aside is not gonna end in success for Elfriede
Bill: Doesn't have to.
Bill: Imagine Elfriede stalking Nokri through the streets trying not to get seen.
Bill: ~~Or he goes all knightboi mode and forces them to come~~
Aldus (Jess): aldus is naive AF
Aldus (Jess): if nokri stops him hell think about it bur aldus is like "yay the military is good right?"
Nokri (Marisa): if he can prove his authority nokri will listen to anything (plus shiny sword is already a sign of wealth)
Aldus (Jess): lmao thats why i said nokri got distracted by something shiny in last weeks post
Aldus (Jess): Elfriede doing himself a manipulate
Aldus (Jess): you wanna fight elfie?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~If you don't come with Elfriede may attempt an arrest or call the nearby gaurd~~
Bill: Which yeah, makes sense.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~but only out of love~~
Aldus (Jess): what sould he even arest them for though?
Bill: lol there are no laws, just god.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: This Eraia boi
Aldus (Jess): rip
Aldus (Jess): why are we here agin?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Good question <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina pops in: why do you assume she's evil just cause she's from dreca
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina two minutes later: laguz suck
Bill: You split up with the reason your here.
Aldus (Jess): Eraia is dumb XD
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah 👌
Bill: Anyway, as a knight Elfriede has full authority to make an arrest. The Cardinal would be the officiant in a dispute, I'd say.
Aldus (Jess): que Aldus standing on the side of the road with his thumb out hitchhiking his way back to... somewhere else
Aldus (Jess): so he could just arrest Aldus cuz he feels liek it?
Aldus (Jess): like Nokri is an enemy race so whatever but
Bill: Might be harder to give a decent reason to arrest Aldus, though racism may help. Nokri is drecian, so easy.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Mainly Nokri but I'm assuming Aldus isn't just gonna let him
Nokri (Marisa): arrested for loitering
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao
Aldus (Jess): if i have to do another "save nokri" mission IM OUT
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But there's dual reasoning going on here anyways
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: He's also concerned for her well being
Aldus (Jess): suuuuuure
Aldus (Jess): my poor sweet pure a;di
Bill: *You also know Eliran and Desii are at the monastery*
Aldus (Jess): oh is tht the same place? Elfy said temple
Bill: same place.
Bill: Elfie just dumb.
Aldus (Jess): OOOO DAMN
Aldus (Jess): fightin words
Nokri (Marisa): ye nokri knows she's just nosy and startin' a conversation
Nokri (Marisa): one of her traits: mega nosy
Aldus (Jess): ~~dats why aldi writes his diary in his own language~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~which translates into good at gathering information~~
Aldus (Jess): Aldus: "OOO if i follow you to church will i get the tiny wafer with the wine?"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yessssss
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Soo good lmao
Nokri (Marisa): struggling to find the words of what nokri would consider aldus
Bill: ~~dog~~
Nokri (Marisa): imma go but ill be back in like 8 hours oyasumi
Aldus (Jess): night ngiht
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nighttttt
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Don't let your dreams be memes
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Actually speaking of which
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: My dream last night invloved me getting pulled over by the cops 4 times
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: One of which was side swiping a parked cop car.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Just light enough to scrape it a bit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _elfriede this is not how you get people to come with you_
Aldus (Jess): yea bra srsly
Aldus (Jess): "well if he as suspicious before"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I think it actually is
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: How else would you try to arrest someone without confrontation?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede actually dies by getting shanked in the gut by a midget
Aldus (Jess): ~you dont~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina finds him
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Fucking AGAIN?"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: "She was as fast as jackel you wouldn't believe it"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Jump cut to nokri tripping over a rock
Bill: Oh man haughty Afina going to be pissed when Desii is a natural.
Bill: Of note for Hal: Theanovene custom is to match the custom of the country you’re visiting. So Theanovene customs are usually kept between theanovene’s.
Bill: words I'm starting to hate: Monastery.
Bill: <@&358049600172589067> we can merge the tables at this point, having Afina, Desii, and Eliran coming across Elfriede confronting Nokri and Aldus. If that's the objective, we'll be making the head table.
Afina (Georgia🍀): M O N A S T E R Y
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH make it
Afina (Georgia🍀): DO ITTTTT
Bill: ~~I'm not going to now, cause you said *monastery*.~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmm desii only saying light of laera would be hilarious
Bill: ?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like if Desii didn't even say Princess Tyndall
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or Lady Afina
Afina (Georgia🍀): If she just said Light of Laera
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like if that was the ONLY name she would call Afina
Bill: Nah, she's not that naive.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _would be hilarious if it were the case though_
Bill: eeeeh I'd feel bad.
Bill: Also, not trying to play a ditz mentally. Just physically.
Afina (Georgia🍀): True
Afina (Georgia🍀): Anywho
Afina (Georgia🍀): _merge merge merge_
Bill: I want to be sure Tom doesn't have any plans for his ongoing arrest.
Bill: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
