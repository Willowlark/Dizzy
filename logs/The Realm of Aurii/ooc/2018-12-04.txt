No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): slight hiatus while i wrap up finals stuff, since i have a ton of stuff to write and some of it takes priority over the quest sowwy ; u ;
i can only write while multitasking and doing dumb stuff so it takes a while.
the next post will take them to the city and be quite substantial.

in the meantime, please post your opinions thus far. I can make another survey if people want to give their opinions anonymously, but i promise words won't hurt me. participation is only 2-3 people now so if there's anything I can do to make it more interesting pls lemme know. thx xoxo
