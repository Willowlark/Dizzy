Bill: “Nothing you have for your character is set in stone until you talk about it” this means you can adjust on the fly if something new pops up in your mind, but also means that in order to give the Gm twists that focus on your haracter you need to talk about things.
Bill: Podcast thoughts.
Bill: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/table-top-babble/id1187771163?mt=2&i=1000431030574 everything in the first half of this interview is relevant to Aurii. Interview with DMs of north by north quest podcast.
Bill: Hell they even have a split table setup like we did.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *wow, normal length podcasts? holy shit*
N🆗ri (Marisa): How long is it like 3 hours?
Bill: Lol a half hour to an hour is normal for most podcasts. But 3~4 is normal for a let’s play because a typical d&d game runs that long.
Bill: Relevant section is 30 minutes or less.
Bill: ~~also some of the things brought up make me want to trash the outline for 2.0~~
Bill: Which prompts this question, why does everyone’s character want to tldr stop the apocalypse? Obviously it’s bad  but what’s core to why they do it specifically?
Bill: ~~oh and the girl in the interview is a cosplayer and she shared her handle.~~
Bill: That was a question for everyone, fyi.
Bill: I was in such a good brainstorming mood, why does work have to involve working.

N🆗ri (Marisa): it being aurii unless the apocalypse is somewhere else
nokri would go down in history as a great legend and be revered as a hero
Bill: ~~she wouldn't though, she'd probably just try and steal as much as possible before she dies?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah nokri isn't a thief
N🆗ri (Marisa): she's like a stern old russian lady who's also kind of lazy
Bill: Ye I might seriously scrap the mist outline.
Bill: I mean, the game hasn't started and isn't on a fast track here so I want to revisit with some things I've learned from interviews and podcasts ~~and when I'm in far better state of mind~~.
Bill: Leaving shortly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm already partying
N🆗ri (Marisa): [blares loud otome game music through all of chat]
