Bill: Still working mostly on appearance Erik?
Erik: Kinda. I think I'm happy with what I've got now. I gotta figure out his personality still but I'm not sure how to tie him to any other characters because I don't really know everyone else's characters that well
Bill: Where he from?
NüÜóri (Marisa): i wouldn't worry on making him relatable to specifically our characters? just make a cool character independent of other character ideas
~~i tried making a character that could work with everyone and she's the hardest to relate to rip~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah make the cool boi first and there‚Äôs always ways to tie him in
Erik: Theanovene
NüÜóri (Marisa): i could reset nokri back to factory settings but that'd be difficult since she already has an established relationship with aldus as a jerk
NüÜóri (Marisa): ~~she just. pretends not to know him until a certain point in time where she's forced to stop acting again.~~
Bill: Not... quite. So Marisa has a point, a blank slate character who'll mesh well and get a personality later is boring. I've made the mistake with characters myself. Characters should be interesting and have interests in their own right, because like people characters bond over common interests and opinions.

Now, Nokri *doesn't* work with everyone Marisa. She wants to *manipulate* or *use* them. That creates a negative bond between her and the character, and that's what contributed to your challenges. That's in character for her, of course, butttt doesn't play well with a game designed around a group of people.
Bill: Well, <@!351471675843411978> was talking about maybe scratching some of Aldus right?
Bill: Maybe you guys can coordinate and make a like, combined retcon.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean I mentioned it but I'm prob gonna keep him as a boi
Bill: ~~rewrite season one to not include all those other people who dropped~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Maybe even in the timeskip Nokri does stuff in thesnovene?
Bill: Like, the dragon kid and mr 'i'm an edgy badass monk'.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Eliran who, never heard of him  <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whomst?
Bill: Exactly.
Aldus Larian (Jess): No I meant the drgon kis and monk thing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Do you mean karate kid?
Bill: ZaRel (Nick's Manakete) and John G's monk.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ooooh
Bill: I'm going ALLLLL the way back.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah no recollection of those there
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH they played literally one round
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _ only real 90s kids remember Kailyn and Atalantia_
Bill: Kailyn was a trip.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Trap*
Leanna: <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: :finger_guns:
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Aurii AU where Kailyn and Elfriede ended up together
Bill: But yeah, you guys could make changes and then retcon the journey to... uh... Trisp, that was it, to reflect the differences. Both of you had changes in mind, don't let old canon restrict you from using the skills you've learned from a year of playing the game to improve your characters. 

Like with the RWBY RP I'm trying to restart with that group I played with, my old characters *sucked*. I'm not sticking to the old canon with Sherwood, I improved him.
Erik: ~~I was wondering who Sherwood was~~
Bill: I've brought that up in BNE before.
Bill: I did a play by post in grad school for RWBY. Had two characters, Sherwood and Sona. Valean and Vacuan. I love them both.
Bill: The group fell apart because the board we were playing on was managed poorly, and the 17 year old member of the group got. Teenagery. Whenever we tried to do something.
Leanna: ~~always more intrigued when things turn into rwby~~
Leanna: üëÄ
Leanna: we should uh.... do a rwby game
Bill: We're all together on a discord to play over discord, but... one member of the team has put off making a character for 2 months now and I'm like, 90% sure she'll be that passive and slow down the group if she even finishes the character.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~Afina Tyndall _was_ my RWBY oc name~~
Bill: We did a poll for genre way back when I first started the idea of PnP. RWBY did not win out. Peeps have expressed it's hard to make a character in that canon due to the lore and weapons and such.
Bill: I'd like to get *one* game running before I dive into yet another game.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Omg Kailin I forgot
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The flirty cat gurl
Bill: Since Aurii been hiatus since... September.
Leanna: ~~i just have no idea about any fire emblem lore so im like struggling to learn via the guide xD, bare with me~~
Bill: Oh no worries. This is *inspired by*, not canon fire emblem. You don't need to do anything with the games.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nothing's really fire emblem except the laguz
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's a really loose world tbh, you can make up what you want too as long as it semi fits
Bill: World guide is all you need.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Everything else biru made
Leanna: alriiiight
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Leanna be like: this is my character, Bumble Bee and he‚Äôs a bee laguz
Leanna: LMaO
Leanna: ~~ngl, i only feed into the bee stuff cause thats what im known for now xD~~
Bill: Like I said the other day, 'talking aloud' as you work (via channel) is helpful cause I can add game knowledge that I have (given I created the world), veto anything that won't fit, provide input... and then you have the whole group's input as well. Tom may find something in your backstory that would mesh well with his.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause Eraians have been messing with the wabbits
Aldus Larian (Jess): *elfriede hold Leanna character at kngie point*
"Oh no, he's hot"
*Drops knife*
Leanna: LMAO
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): /cue make outs
Leanna: "its wabbit season!"
~~"...Dick season. üòè "~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): "Elfriede does not believe in drink or sex, until he does" -Jess (12/24 12:14 am)
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I have all the play by post quotes from like forever ago
Erik: ~~what kind of weapons does everyone got~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Afina is a light mage so she uses magic books
Aldus Larian (Jess): I bow boi
Aldus Larian (Jess): Might be a dagger boi sometimes too not sure
Bill: ~~Eliran uses copyright infringement~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): ‚òùÔ∏è
Bill: Why are there still no peg knights or wyvern riders in this game.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Afina used to have a back up dagger til Elfriede taught her to use a sword (<:lenny:395307171539189760>) but now that he‚Äôs a furry she‚Äôs probably gonna go back to dagger
Bill: ~~downgrading then~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It‚Äôs not the size of the weapon it‚Äôs how you use it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): WELL a princess magic Pegasus knight would be very Mary Sue
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Every character lowkey has a color by association, what is Nokris?
NüÜóri (Marisa): nokri wasn't allowed a dragon
Bill: Did I not allow that?
Bill: Weird.
Bill: We can revisit your idea, cause new year new ~~Nokri`~ you.
NüÜóri (Marisa): D R A G O N  N O K R I
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): afina has a mental breakdown cause everyones a furry except her
Erik: I might have figured out a name for my character...
Erik: by using the ol' "mash foreign words together" method
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): goooood
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): what is it?
Bill: *I love that method*
Erik: Chenghu (or Chengu, not sure if that H looks good) Tiaowen
Bill: Asian names would be a first in Aurii, neat.
Erik: He's a tiger. My first thought was China
Erik: it means "orange tiger stripe"
Leanna: i like it without the h
Leanna: but thats a good ass name
Erik: *yeet*
Erik: This OC name brought to you in part by Google Translate
Leanna: a mood‚Ñ¢
Leanna: Idk if i like Kai or Kaio better for a first name
NüÜóri (Marisa): "my name's kaio but that's long so everyone calls me kai"
Leanna: ü§î  yes
Erik: *Kaiyang*
Leanna: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Leanna: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Leanna: OOOOOOOOOOooook its kaio now because kai is too close to tai <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Kaio is nice.
Erik: you're welcome!
Leanna: THANKS
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thank god no more A names
Erik: Yeah I was wondering about that. I was like *"Everyone's name starts with an A or at least a vowel..."*
Leanna: ~~its very confusing, cause i cant differentiate names LMAO~~
Leanna: ~~my cheat sheet gonna be useful as fuck for me~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): The only As now are Aldus and Afina
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _we kiled the others_
Bill: Afina stole their screen time.
Leanna: <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you stop that even if its true üò≠ üò≠ üò≠
Bill: nyahahhaa
