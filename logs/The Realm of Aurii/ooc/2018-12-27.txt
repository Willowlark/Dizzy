秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ah
Tonight I’ll be able to start this up again now that im back and relatively free-er
Is there still an interest in this? I can make an anonymous poll if people are scared to answer but if there’s no more interest that’s perfectly fine.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 👍 interest to continue
👎  no interest to continue
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): yeee was thinking about it yesterday
Bill: Jess, Tom, if you want to start on your interlude work while you're stuck at work this week, I'll be available to help ya out.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): We shall see
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I had a few ideas but i forgot all of them
Bill: Mood
Bill: So I scrapped the Yuria arc I had planned (killing your darlings), I can give you the summary of how that went Tomu.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that'd be good
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That'll help decide what to do with Elfriede
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'd like to avoid outcasting him into the woods
Bill: mm.  I have to copy the notes outta my notebook tho.
Bill: ~~or take a picture cause two pages of notes~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I gotta mindlessly scan documents all day so that’s primo brainstorming time
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2018/12/27/yuria.html
Bill: Fleshed it out a little bit, but still notes format.
Bill: Does anyone remember if I invited Denny Hill to play Aurii way back when?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the name rings 0 bells :0
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah dunno
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I like the Cyn Yuria duo a lot 👌
Bill: ~~oh good you were quiet for a long while there~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): So there are two different times they were "captured"
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): The first revealed her tail
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And the second was this whole plan
Bill: The first happened naturally, the latter was significant later (year maybe) and was planned.
Bill: yeah.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): However news in Eraia prior to this was that she had gone dark
Bill: Covert op.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And his parents began to worry
Bill: They're apparent death explained where they went.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Remember when you said you might take Eraian names from souls?
Bill: Yup, who knew how long they'd be in deep, so Eraia had them marked MIA to keep people asking questions.
Bill: I DID IT INTENTIONALLY YES
Bill: I wasn't sure if Cyn was ACTUALLY a name from dark souls, but I googled for like an hour to find a dark souls name that would fit him.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Cyn is really close to Syhn and is pretty much pronounced the same
Bill: I'm *so glad* it actually was a dark souls name!
Bill: ,...
Bill: close enough.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Close enough
Bill: I knew Cyn would need a name from dark souls since he's Yuria ~~boyfriend~~ partner.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Sihn is a dragon that was forced underground
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Partner, friend, Occasional fucc
Bill: SO in addition to the rescue ( which in true little brother fashion you'd botch her plans) her arc would have involved 'I ruined my relationship by showing my beast form, I'm a failure' Elfie meeting 'I embraced who I am because I was inspired by my partner' Yuria.
Bill: She could then pass on the lesson to Elfie and inspire him with Afrin.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah true, good contrast
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And maybe jealousy
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Don't want him to be too petty
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But he might
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He do as he do
Bill: Yuria is decidedly not a fan of Faun tradition anymore. She's not about to out the family, but she's accepted herself and doesn't care who sees it. (She'll say she was adopted in secret if pressured.) She and Cyn have both earned their merit as Inquisitors, and she doesn't need the family name to know her worth.
Bill: And their dynamic, which I didn't mention, is she tempers his suicidal streak (because he's never had a reason to care if he died before, as a thrill seeker) and he keeps her from tightening up and losing herself.
Bill: ~~see why I said killing my darling~~
Bill: But they'll be in Eraia and can *certain* get involved with the party later.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): WOO
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): AURII'S HOTTEST COUPLE
Bill: being in Eraia not confirmed, I mean they not undercover.
Bill: ~~If Cyn gives you Sun feels, you're getting there~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nahhh he seems a bit more roguish
Bill: very true.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Do you have a look down
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Did I miss it?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I kinda imagine him with a short pony tail for some reason
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Likereal short
Bill: Mood. Yeah. I don't think I had notes for it, but I'm feeling tanner than typical, black hair, the short ponytail...
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Black cat nya
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Kitty bad luck charm
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yuria has slightly redder hair than Elfriede and long as shit, kinda was thinking Cordelia length (I know,not military but we must suspend believe for FASHON)
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Mostly pony tailed or braided
Bill: YUP
Bill: character design is always more important than common sense.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): YEEEEE
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I dig it
Bill: ~~one of the good things about RWBY, nice job Monty~~
Bill: Actually, your interlude could include meeting them. Though I imagine it’d be more fun to role play the meeting.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): True dat, I mean I think it would be alright having Elfriede know they are alright before meeting them
Bill: Oh Yuria does a Holo-esk bandanna I her head for covering her would be ears.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Its a really wierd thing cuz Elfriede would be HELLA excited to see her again and happy
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Would be?
Bill: Cut off?
Bill: So it’s just the stumps?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh to try to hide them?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Hmm, I'm down for that in a regular sense but it would look so not military
Bill: It doesn’t perfectly hide them, which she now likes, but also doesn’t have gross stumps visible to everyone.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): neither would a long ass pony tail XD
Bill: It’s a casual wear choice.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'm saying it clashes babe
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I think casual is okay
Bill: Not for her military outfit. (Which is still completely customizable because what I said before and inquisitors are above standard rules.)
Bill: I had this image of their plan happening, Yuria getting cornered by a Drecian, Elfriede sees it sneaking into camp, bolts to save her, gets cut off by Cyn (also dressed as a Drecian) and Yuria facepalms as the two fight.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ah found the design from last year
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Not exact but a brainstorm
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That would've been halarious
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Welcome to Aurii 2.0 where we shit all over what our characters wanted the first half of the game
Bill: ?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Elfriedes all “sister-Chan!” And then sees her and is like whaaat
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And afrins like “I’m home!” And gets home and is like wow... boring
