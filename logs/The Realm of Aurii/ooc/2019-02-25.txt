Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): now just to think of a stunt
N🆗ri (Marisa): how are stunts different from aspects?
Bill: http://aurii.us go read the Season 2 articles.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): theyre like a magic trick to my knowledge
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you use it as like a special trap card lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i c
so aspects can be used for and against the character, while stunts are things the characters can do to benefit themselves?
Bill: ye kinda.
N🆗ri (Marisa): so stuff being invoked always costs a fate point, and when it's compelled it always earns a fate point ya?
Bill: yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nokri had a birthday she's older now 🎉
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yay!

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): LETS TAKE IT FROM THE TOP ~~8 years ago I became the one and only Spider-Man~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): We got 4 different players from 4 different countries, plus the rotation of characters that Bill can assume to interact
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Afina Tyndall, my gurl, is a princess from a kingdom that values knowledge. She was denied ascending the throne because she wasn’t deemed “smart enough”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Elfriede Faun, Toms character, is a solider from the nation of Eraia, which is a pretty religious nation. He’s secretly from a furry species, and hides his tail so people don’t know. He goes where ever the military tells him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Aldus Larian, HES also a furry boi, but doesn’t hide his identity, his problem is actually that he can’t transform into a full Wolf like most furry bois (they’re called laguz). He’s been on a quest to find a potion to cure this
Bill: ~~oh bring up the time you and Tom wrote borderline smut~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): IM GETTIN THERE, IT WAS FOR PLOT
N🆗ri (Marisa): Then there’s Nokri she’s the angelic mascot everybody loves who never causes trouble
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Nokri Lyleon, she’s a merchant from the kingdom of commerce, she’s kind of a gremlin. She’s on a quest for money and power 😈
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So Afina travelled with Elfriede to Eraia (his home country) to learn more about MAGICS
Bill: EXACTLY how Nokri shoild be described.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Aldus bumped into Nokri and she attached to him like a leech with promises of helping him find the potion
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): They all converged in Eraia, where a zealous cleric person dude attacked them, and now they’ve all returned home
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but a leech that hates him ~~but maybe low key thinks hes cute? well never know~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): For Aurii Volume 2, Afina is summoning them all back to her mansion for a festival
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is that what we're doing?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s what billiam said
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Uh did I hit the overarching plot
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~see i dont know either you guys are fine~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Aldi is nokri’s bff
Bill: You all had to be at the Laeran castle. I didn’t care why.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~He is?~~
~~someone should let him know~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Afiner is her savior
