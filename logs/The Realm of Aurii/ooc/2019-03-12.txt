Bill: Aspects are good, laguz pride is probably going to be hardest to invoke. It‚Äôs an easy compel though, so it‚Äôll cause trouble and earn you Fate points. 

Your stunt should read ‚Äúsneakily act in the dark‚Äù not or. Even with that, I‚Äôm going to say that‚Äôs too broad of a category. You either need to narrow that down to less scenarios, or think differently. (Cough Faunus history cough)

Your last two aspects should absolutely about his history or relationships. Give him connections outside of himself.
