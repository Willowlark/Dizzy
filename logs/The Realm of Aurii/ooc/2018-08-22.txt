Bill: posts tomorrow.
Bill: That said; If Morras decides to go through the building to follow you all, you can get a head start and turn the fighting into an escape from town.
Bill: No more fight, and we can leave trisp (yay).
Bill: Thoughts.
Nokri (Marisa): does this raise our infamy
Bill: you getting infamy no matter what you do.
Bill: Not enough to id you, but enough to make the next bit of travel difficult.
Nokri (Marisa): we'll need false moustaches
Aldus (Jess): ugh im not caught up.... again D:
Bill: My idea is Eraian troops hound you for awhile, and you're stuck between rock and a hard place. Then the rabbit laguz anti eraian rebellion gives you an out, but that's it's own mess.
Nokri (Marisa): chuunibyou bunny girl pls 🙏
Afina (Georgia🍀): What are Afina and Elfriede doin?
Bill: same shit?
Bill: Or whatever you'd like for them to do doing.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Do they also get _the infamy_
Bill: Not quite, unless caught.
Bill: Unless Tom *wants* Elfriede burned for the murder.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm confuse
Afina (Georgia🍀): Are they pinned for Torins murder then?
Bill: only if Tom wants that as part of Elfriede's character arc.
Bill: There were no witnesses, and Elfriede Isn't A Lego ™, so he'd be clear of suspicion.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ah ok so where does the infamy come in
Afina (Georgia🍀): Is the Cardinal gonna TATTLE
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Wah these weenies didn't help me fight the bandits"
Bill: infamy in this case means you're being chased.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Are the eraians specifically chasing Afina and Elfriede or is it because they're associated with Da Bandits™
Bill: It will lead to your caught, and gain some legitimate infamy. Or, you escape with the rabbits, but they'll want help in return for the favor.
Elfriede (Tom): How many GTA stars do we get
Afina (Georgia🍀): Y E A H
Bill: I'm assuming you'd all run together.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean is there like wanted posters of the Whole Crew
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or specifically like Nokri and Eliran
Bill: no. They can't confirm anything, Cardinal doesn't know them.
Afina (Georgia🍀): So eraia is just lookin for Enera and if we're caught with Enera then we ALL look bad
Bill: so unless the group sent out by him can get a hold of the group, the crime is sorta of cleared.
Bill: Pretty much.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Where they runnin to next then?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just out?
Elfriede (Tom): Well if we run
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina: "lets go to Laera WOO"
Elfriede (Tom): There's gonna be an emotional fallout
Elfriede (Tom): And then a what do?
Elfriede (Tom): Then Elfriede will be like, well kinda wanna go find yuira still but...
Afina (Georgia🍀): Well they could take care of just escaping now
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then stop in like the woods or some shit
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): And everyone could have one big aside where they bicker about where to go
Bill: So going to Callora won't work, at least without going the long way. The Cardinal will expect Enera to go that way and will have troops and clergy at the border.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede be all "I have to find ~~winter~~ Yuria" and Afina all "I wanna go home" and Aldus all "we need to finish the mission and take Enera back and get the lego healing drugs"
Bill: Which means you have to cross most of Eraia to get back to Lyall and get a ship, then past the war zone again.
Bill: Unless some pirates help you out.
Elfriede (Tom): So for Afina going home
Elfriede (Tom): There needs to be a blocker on that
Elfriede (Tom): Like a reason she cant
Bill: That's why I like owing a favor to the rabellion.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Where da pirates at
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH YOU MEAN THE ONES AFINA AND ELFRIEDE GANKED oof awkward
Bill: You'll be forced to work together while you repay the favor, Afina will see a group of Laguz that are fighting for a right to live, Eraia's dark side will be shown, and you'll have a group adventure (tbd) to go on.
Bill: That can serve as the backdrop for getting Afina and Elfie sorted out.
Afina (Georgia🍀): So are the pirates a means to get back to callora tho? is that the final goal
Bill: Dunno. There is no final goal from me.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Stuck on a smol ship forced to work out their differences whoopee
Afina (Georgia🍀): Well I don't think everyone wants to babysit Enera for very long
Bill: Enera wants to go home, sometime. The Kouneli can take her back off screen though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus need him drugs tho
Bill: Kouneli can get the coastal plant thing, it can be part of the adventure. After that, the pieces of the drug require globe trotting.
Afina (Georgia🍀): wasnt that the whole point in getting enera
Afina (Georgia🍀): like there was some kinda trade off
Afina (Georgia🍀): i dont remember the events pre table merge too well oops
Elfriede (Tom): Oh ye, and we need to deliver her home
Elfriede (Tom): So much that needs doing
Elfriede (Tom): I'd say priority would be to get her home
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede would also.like to explain what happened to his family if they aren't fugitives
Afina (Georgia🍀): "yeah were all ashamed to be furries so... hey ho here i am"
Afina (Georgia🍀): ok so
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): do i have this right
Afina (Georgia🍀): and how to affect in game so they get steered towards a particular path
Afina (Georgia🍀): im thinkin they use the pirates to get back to callora
Afina (Georgia🍀): then drop off enera and make the next move from there
Bill: Talk more after lunch.
Bill: Also can office hours later, fyi.
Bill: So. Enera does want to get home, obviously, but the Cardinal doesn't want that. He's going to send people to the Callora/Eraia border to prevent her from going that way, which extends to the rest of you. You could make a break through Eraia, across the bay, past the Drecia/Eraia frontlines, back to Theanovene, and then around the mountains the same way Aldus and Nokri took to Desii's hometown to start with. That would pass Laera on the way. I find this lame, as it could end up being a travel montage.

The group could encounter trouble getting through Eraia, and the Kouneli (rabbit) pirates will come in with a rescue offer, but only if they get a favor. The pirates show you the other side of Eraia, the side that conquered their island and squashed their culture, and ask you to help with some kind of mission they need a knight/princess/wolf/etc for. They'll offer to take care of Enera in the mean time, and get her home if you accept their request. They'll also get you to the southern edge of Eraian territory, down by the frontlines. This can lead into looking for Yuria, and Aldo can also get the kissaelain territories component of his potion.
Bill: The latter is what I think sounds good.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeeee
Bill: Any alternatives people have, share.
Bill: <@!350855105123319808> will be joining up soon as well, in the latter scenario likely already with the pirates/rebellion.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOOO
Bill: Pirates would be a good chance for Aldo to step up and coral the stupid, as everyone else is going to be caught up in being stupid Jess.
Aldus (Jess): being stupid? what do u mean?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani
Bill: Elfriede is going to be acting like Saeran, Afina's going into an edgelord phase with ~~tattoos~~ dark magic, Nokri is going to be occupying the role of devil on Afina's shoulder, Desii will be preoccupied with Enera and GMPCs are not supposed to lead groups anyway...
Bill: Aldus is in a good spot to say 'look you idiots, we do this together or we die'.
Aldus (Jess): o
Afina (Georgia🍀): Everyone is Saeren and nothing hurts
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus is MC
Afina (Georgia🍀): nothing can go wrong
Aldus (Jess): ~~i thought we weren't doing the aldus harem~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooo the return of Tikur means mORE FURRIES
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina's gonna be so happy
Bill: Use some of those leadership skills daddy never praised him for.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _d a d d y_
Aldus (Jess): PLZ
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wolf Daddy™
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus is just like "my wolf daddy was a jerk"
Bill: ~~Aldus was definitely not a character I’d have peg for ‘I wanna be harem pimp’~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): THREE WOLF BOIS wow all our wolf ladies are gone RIP
Aldus (Jess): yea 😦
Aldus (Jess): rip oh well
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tho Elfriede and Aldus aren't like Wolf Boi proper, but we'll see how that'll change later
Bill: ~~start making hints for Ashley to embrace her furry side~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I want to welcome Ashley's bara furry woman to the group
Bill: *bara furry?*
Bill: Is that homestuck speak?
Aldus (Jess): i mean i can try to be more leady with aldus ~~but my own leadership skills suck so~~
Aldus (Jess): no dear
Afina (Georgia🍀): Well Aldus is the only one with a working brain as of very soon
Aldus (Jess): what happened to eliran?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like Aldus is like 2B and everyone else is like the little robots walking into things saying "this cannot continue"
Afina (Georgia🍀): He's injured, hasn't vented his anger about Afina getting hurt so he's liable to punch elfie, we dunno
Aldus (Jess): ah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Can't wait to start Afina's dark magic phase wowee
Afina (Georgia🍀): She just thought about killing someone so I'd say that's a good start
Aldus (Jess): ok so afina and efriede arnet even with the rest of us?
Afina (Georgia🍀): They're going down the stairs like prissy noble people
Aldus (Jess): and then we are running away? or?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee running into the coastal area
Afina (Georgia🍀): Essentially backtracking the route Afina and Elfriede took and getting to the boats
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then I guess they're all gonna fight in the inn together and Aldus is gonna be like my dudes, there are boats
Bill: You're thinking of the wrong city.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Whoops
Aldus (Jess): ~~did i miss the planning for this or?~~
