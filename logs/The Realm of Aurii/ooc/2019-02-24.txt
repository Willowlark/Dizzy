Dirty Lego (Tom): San began her morning routine. After preparing for breakfast which would be held in a hour she went to cleaning each of the Fauns rooms. She eventually made her way to the young Knight's. The room was vacant. She had just begun some light dusting when she noticed a stack of unsent letters that appear slightly dusty. As if they've been sitting there for a few months. She couldn't help her curiosity to take a slight peak at one and snatched it up quietly.


To my friend,


I miss you, how have you been? Once we left the town where… so much happened, I returned to Lyall, my family needed to know the truth as fast as possible to decide what needed to be done. As you may or may not have guessed, I am under house arrest under the jurisdiction of my parents. I do not blame them, I feel… deserving.

Ah, but being such a thorough thinker like you are, perhaps you are just curious about what the Eraians know of us. Various reports of rag tag group and the murder of a higher up by a laguz circulated but didn't gain too much traction due to the dissuasion my the Faun family as well as their friends in power. In fact the same military contact was the same one who suggested house arrest. Commander Greaves has always had our family's best interest in mind and we owe a lot to him.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Moreso now that I made such an idiotic mistake. Mother's gaze is an intense one, but one tipped with a hint of understanding. I am only allowed into the backyard once per moon cycle for the moment. It should be a few months before I will be allowed into the market district again.

I spend most days training, studying and reflecting on the recent events.

...I don't regret what I have done, but I regret the situation it put my family in. And the situation I put you in.

I hope to see you again. And I'm sorry for everything.


Signed name: Elfriede Faun


The letter is written carefully and neatly, but the dust clearly shows that it was never sent out. San covers her mouth tearing up a bit, she knew who it was for. She hears footsteps coming down the hall so she quickly puts it all away and wipes her tears. 


Elfriede approaches her and smiles ever so slightly, and asks if she needs help with anything. She declines and smiles politely back. “Actually…” she says, “If I may be so bold, why don't you shave your **whiskers** Ser Faun, it doesn't suit you.”


Elfriede bring one hand up to his short beard he grew and runs his thumb and pointer down it. “What San you don't think it makes me look grizzled? Roguishly attractive? Dashing?” 


Sans smirks and her eyebrows droop. “Nope! I'll shave it for you later. Be ready in 90 minutes!” she keeps her smirk and struts out of the room. Elfriede sighs a bit, the teasing much needed to help his mood. He and San have gotten a lot closer and more casual since his stay home. 


San peaks her head back in around the door frame. “And for the love of Lyall stop sighing Ser Faun! You're never going to woo **any** woman that way!” Heavy footsteps are heard down the hall as she storms off.
