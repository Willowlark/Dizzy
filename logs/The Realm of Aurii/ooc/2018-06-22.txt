Afina (Georgia🍀): She would like _poison everyone_ or something
Afina (Georgia🍀): I know she knocks herself out in battle
Afina (Georgia🍀): But like Afina would be sleeping and nokri would put a leaf in her ear and boom dead
Bill: That's not how poison works.
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's like... ALMOST how hamlet worked
Aldus (Jess): i think battle royale is usually under the assumption that you are all actively trying to kill each other
Aldus (Jess): so like no sleeping

Afina (Georgia🍀): This is a multi-day royals

Aldus (Jess): calhony or somehting

Aldus (Jess): wait
Bill: ```
"It's more of theoretical cure than anything else, I should start with that. Danthres, much like with his lust potion, never tested it." she pauses, realizing what she said could crush Aldus's hopes. "Ah, but there's a reason he's so well regarded. None of the potions he theorized failed." she says quickly to ease his mind.

"The original concept was something to bring out the beast in a human. Danthres's theories were built based on combining the effects of ingredients and potions he knew the effects of. He took Brakehweed, which has the effect of putting people in a bit of a berserker state, then combined that with Calholly, a native plant from Wynne. If I remember correctly... Right, Calholly is poisonous to humans, yet serves as a wonderful spice to the laguz people. Anyway, that and few other mundane ingredients was to cover the animalistic part. The second set of components started with Crysalin, an Eraian plant that actually becomes water when it dies. It transforms from seed to water, it's quite unique in that. After that... oh my, it calls for Denuh..." Desii pauses, lost in thought completely. 

"Sorry, right. Denuh is a mineral stone that's found in Elbia, or well, was found in Elbia. Or I suppose I should say was found in Elbia. Any piece of Denuh would do, based on the recipe, but it's still quite difficult to find the stone. Be...yond that..." she trails off, heading back into the book. "That's it. Everything else isn't too hard to access. Run of the mill stuff." ```
Bill: ```Desii gives you a moment to process, all the more helpful since she speaks quickly. Each of you recognize one of the components in a heartbeat. Nokri saw Brakehweed experimented on laguz in Drecian occupied area of the Kissaelain territories. It didn't take long before command gave up on that avenue, to volatile. There's no self respecting Wynnite wolf who doesn't know Calholly; both to prevent the Wynnites from eating it and because it's just that good. Denuh was one of many rare minerals of Elbia, something else lost to her fall. Eliran's met a handful of people in the past with Denuh accessories, elders who lives in Elbia in days before her collapse. The only thing you don't know the exact location of is the Crysalin, though you at least have a direction to head in.
[9:10 AM] Bill: "I... can't help with most of these... At least to any more specific locations than I've already given." Desii says. "Except for the Crysalin. I happen to know it grows out by Trisp, on the coastline. It's always been a fascinating plant to me." she says sheepishly. 

"They say drinking Crysalin water is like nothing you've ever tasted." Dain contributes from the bar. "Like alcohol without the alcohol." Desii nods to the bartender before turning back to the pages. When she looks up again this time, she closes the book with a bookmark on the page of the potion.

"The brewing looks like something you're going to want to have a skilled person do... You won't need the lead brewer of Theanovene's guild no, but not a total amateur. Shouldn't be hard to find." She says. She then smiles at Aldus. "There's definitely a cure for you. Isn't it wonderful?"```
Aldus (Jess): i feel kind of strange asking desii for more info like would she even have any more info? i guess we can talk flowers and enera
Bill: Or Desii might ask about not transforming, if that was hard, or whatever.
Bill: Conversation can happen naturally once it's started.
Aldus (Jess): hmm true ~~asides always intimidate me~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): or talk about FEELINGS
Afina (Georgia🍀): aldus and desii can HOLD HANDS 👀
Aldus (Jess): umm how long did it take afina and elfriede to do that?

Afina (Georgia🍀): _thats how you woo a woman_
Bill: ~~it took so long because they're both virgos~~

Bill: ~~who said that wasn't canon~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): these hos gotta stop callin my work i need to write a response
Afina (Georgia🍀): /picks up phone "i cant help you right now i need to write a kiss"
Bill: Georgia: "yes, yes, you're looking to upgrade from you KisslerIMEAN chrysler."
Aldus (Jess): Biru is desii referring to Nokri being cold the "usual approach" or the fake nice?
Bill: being cold.
Aldus (Jess): Oooo ok
Eliran (Halim): Ooo jess 
Aldus eliran should talk when u done desi aside
Aldus (Jess): 👌
Aldus (Jess): I'mma be at a graduation later but I only have to pay attention for the "G" section
Eliran (Halim): Aldus referring to "all these nobles" and including eliran I assume
Aldus (Jess): ye hehe
Aldus (Jess): secret noble name
Aldus (Jess): aldi gon call him out when he see him oooo
Eliran (Halim): That's what I want tooooo
Eliran (Halim): Eliran has been p much only good with people so far except for Nokri, who llesbehonest deserves/deserved it 
And elfriede, which was cause he was interrupting racist boi attacking his compatriots
Eliran (Halim): He needs proper friendship drama
Eliran (Halim): Even if it's small 
Or worked out well
Eliran (Halim): He needs a call out post
Bill: Emphasize one of his faults.
Eliran (Halim): I know I need to 
One of his initial flaws I'm trying to incorporate better is that he uses words to diffuse or get around stuff 
But it also leads to resentment
Eliran (Halim): For example, with Elfriede, the knight boi was basically verbally/socially forced into backing down 
Which worked out fine (partially cause princess gf) 
But the dudes pride is stuck and he was feeling bitter after it
Eliran (Halim): At least as far as 8 could tell in posts
Aldus (Jess): Oh wait do you want like Aldus to actually be butthurt about it? I was just going to be playful 😂
Eliran (Halim): I think it'd make sense if he was actually a bit upset about it
Bill: That's not a flaw for Eliran though. It's a thing he does that annoys people yes, but it brings out negative feelings in everyone else.
Eliran (Halim): Hes been traveling with eliran for weeks 
Like the Eliran he knew was a bard who did  relatively well 
And out of nowhere hes revealed hes the son of a giant trading company, close friends with a princess, and has a name of weight
Eliran (Halim): At least in Alduss mind
Aldus (Jess): hmmm true aight i make him annoyed
Aldus (Jess): funny, Aldus is supposed to be chill™ but hes gotten upset the most out of any character, opps
Eliran (Halim): Plus nobody else is going to be annoyed by the reveal, Nokri is gonna kiss his ass, Desii  probably just gonna roll with it cause she didn't really know him anyways
Aldus (Jess): "WHAT DA HECKIE ELI-DUDE"
Bill: Are they going to fuck NOW?
Aldus (Jess): "how *done* they were" 👀
Afina (Georgia🍀): I DIDNT WANNA SOUND LIKE A DIRTY PERSON BUT HOW ELSE DO YOU PHRASE IT
Aldus (Jess): nah you good
Aldus (Jess): ~~then elfy leans her back nice and slow and shows her how not *done* he is~~
Bill: 🌶
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: > Everyone sits down to have breakfast 
> Elfriede and Afina are last
> They walk in
> Everyone else starts clapping
> Eliran says after the clapping fades: "Congratulations"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~how did you know~~

Afina (Georgia🍀): uhhh theyre pretty high up on the military chain i think
Eliran (Halim): Oh so like they hide the fact from everybody?
Eliran (Halim): Including other nobles?
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah they like hide their tails
Bill: They're nobles via military achievement. They'd be know by someone who pays attention to things like that, but they aren't any one super noteworthy.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like yuria has a lego lover so hes probably like the only ones who know
Bill: allegedly.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye allegedly
Bill: Also Tom did write back story, it's on his character page.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like the waiter in elfies hometown recognized him right away

Afina (Georgia🍀): she too pure tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): too wholesome
Aldus (Jess): NO
Aldus (Jess): biru, how pure is desii?
Aldus (Jess): better question
Aldus (Jess): what are desiis views on relationships and sex?
Aldus (Jess): how steamy those romance novels get?
Bill: She knows about the sex, has likely never actually had a real relationship, but has the romantic view of one a shoujo character would. It's never been a priority for her in the real world, but it's not a opportunity she'd turn down.
Aldus (Jess): WHOO!
Afina (Georgia🍀): ALRIGHT THERES HOPE FOR ALDUS WOO
Bill: Ya'll just don't make me regret playing a female character.

Afina (Georgia🍀): us, a year later: what if it was basically just a dating sim tho
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *I'm sorrrry*
Bill: Well, I'd have expected you and Hal to make it a dating sim, since you guys were honeymooning at the time. :V
Aldus (Jess): ~~give me my damn romantic subplot or so help me~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): _and then you put hal on another table_
Aldus (Jess): see i was going to see about doing that with tom but then i was like "nah ill be a boy"
Bill: Ah, so you were planning it. :V
Afina (Georgia🍀): *_and put a knight on the same table as a princess instead_*
Aldus (Jess): hal didnt even show up for like 4 month whatchu talking bout
Afina (Georgia🍀): ***you read tv tropes bill, you knew what you were doing***
Bill: Jess: I don't think demanding is how you woo. ~~This isn't your mystic messups~~
Aldus (Jess): i guess his character was semi planned though

Aldus (Jess): ILL SHOW YOU LEWD
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~do it~~
Aldus (Jess): *opens google docs*
Afina (Georgia🍀): _le gasp_
Bill: Desii was totally impromptu, I liked the spelling as a twist of Dizzy and ran with it, my original plan was a pegasus knight. Wonder how that character would have turned out.
Afina (Georgia🍀): pegasus knight WOMAN?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~cause either way that would have afina like "elfriede who?"~~
Bill: While I'm not actually enforcing it, Fire Emblem has a strict 'woman only' for the pegasus knight class.
Bill: So woman, yes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): what the fuck color is elfriedes hair
Afina (Georgia🍀): im thinking like a chestnut color but idk
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): s w e e t my guess was right
Bill: ~~wait so once they get back together after reveal I should throw in a pegasus knight then~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): aurii: the soap opera

Aldus (Jess): or elfy being smooth and all "i dont want to rush this princess, i intend to treat you like the lady you are"
Aldus (Jess): which one it gon be
Afina (Georgia🍀): Could be anything
Afina (Georgia🍀): he could just be really good at hiding it and everyone lives happily ever after
Afina (Georgia🍀): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aldus (Jess): or they do it, but elfy makes weird excused about why he can take his pants off
Aldus (Jess): im betting some variant of the first 2
Afina (Georgia🍀): "My lady I don't want to offend you with my butt, so I must wear pants" "Elfriede what"
Aldus (Jess): "my butt is so wonderous i dont want you to get jealous"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aside 2: "yeah I can't imagine ~~who~~ what the princess is doing in eraia"
Aldus (Jess): I STG <@!351785752197201920>  you better write that boner
Aldus (Jess): HAHA yea
Afina (Georgia🍀): Jess gets home first, locks the door, "I'm not letting you in until you write that boner"

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: i noticed
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeah, its tough to end it, when you ship it
Afina (Georgia🍀): She's finally happy 😭😭
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *it was tough to write buzz kill elfriede im sorry*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: This moment is the highest point
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: its all down hill from here TwT
Bill: you're going to get the back together anyway, and every romance story has a rough patch.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idkkk she's rejecting elfriedes entire BEING
Afina (Georgia🍀): that he's already sensitive about
Afina (Georgia🍀): So sensitive that he doesn't fuck the girl he likes
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760> 😭

*T.T*
Aldus (Jess): Me?
Aldus (Jess): Yea do it for me
Afina (Georgia🍀): The alternate ending: they just do very convenient positions for the rest of forever and live happily ever after
Bill: At some point tonight Tom is going to be like “oh Afina” to Jess and Georgias gunna call out “Elfriede” and both you gunna laughed at. 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): /Afina hovers over Desii "hey kid don't be like me and fuck it up by being a racist"
Afina (Georgia🍀): N O
Aldus (Jess): I would not laugh
Afina (Georgia🍀): I have no doubt that hal is gonna chide me about it
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think he's done that before idk
Aldus (Jess): I mean as a joke is fine in context
Aldus (Jess): But like
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^
Bill: ~~I imagine it would end violently~~
Aldus (Jess): I would probably just cry
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm pretty sure I called Hal Eliran once and he just stoped and walked away
Aldus (Jess): Oh I call Tom elfriede but like during sex is a whole different thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah doing it seriously is a no no
Afina (Georgia🍀): Jokingly it's fuckin hilarious
Afina (Georgia🍀): IMO
Aldus (Jess): Ye!
Aldus (Jess): Although calling me Aldus would be a lil weird
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: DO IT FOR HIM
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: i carefully color edited this now
Aldus (Jess): He traded the pins for glasses
Aldus (Jess): *makes female character to steal elfriede from Afina*
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😮
Afina (Georgia🍀): _steals aldus from desii??_
Afina (Georgia🍀): desii becomes evil
Aldus (Jess): Oh no
Afina (Georgia🍀): so story time, as im writing afrins response
Afina (Georgia🍀): my 8th grade history teacher was like "what do you think is the origins of the word _enthrall_"
Afina (Georgia🍀): and she was like "well now it means that someone/something has someones attention"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "as in like, my lover enthralls me"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "turns out, the word comes from vikings, where the original meaning meant ENSLAVE"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "so be careful when you say someone enthralls you"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Makes sense
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Thralls is a slave
Afina (Georgia🍀): im still gonna use the word in my response but dammit this lady has ruined a whole word for me
Aldus (Jess): But of you say "you enthrall me" then that could be kinky <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): y u p
Aldus (Jess): Nice
Bill: You fucks and your kinks.
Afina (Georgia🍀): actualLY IT WAS WORD ETYMOLOGY
Afina (Georgia🍀): jokes on you <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: It really is.
Bill: It really is.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yo casual reminder that aside 1 and 2 are happening at the same time
Afina (Georgia🍀): "yeah the princess seems nice" [jump cut to her and elfriede]
Bill: you missed the strikeout comment didn't you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): wut
Bill: ```"We may find out, if Eliran and her continue to spend time together. The Princess seems nice, ~~wholesome, totally not shacking up with Elfriede right now~~ I'd like it if we could." Desii says. "Ah, to bring it back around, the monastery is the first building to be built in Trisp and there's a lot of knowledge there. It may have the location of the Crysalin written down somewhere."```
Bill: Was the original message.
Aldus (Jess): No I didn't lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH I DIDNT SEE THAT EITHER LMAO
Bill: *someone* is too interested in her smut to read the other table.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ITS PLOT
Bill: You know what aside-1 needs?
Bill: ~~a bucket of ice water~~
Bill: Rica coming for a visit!
Afina (Georgia🍀): PFFT
Afina (Georgia🍀): rica walks in: "ok well that explains at least three of the questions i had"
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): Is that assassin's Creed
Afina (Georgia🍀): is that rica
Bill: random from Pinterest. She banging tho.
