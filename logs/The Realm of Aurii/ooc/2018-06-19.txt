Eliran (Halim): soooo posts....?
Bill: I just got home.
Bill: Think we need to figure out how to go about this, extable-2 knows about Enera and I think a casual name drop during the meal would be a good way to get extable-1 going towards that discovery. I think that'd be best as a next round of posting, with getting some asiding going.
Bill: I'm also not posting tonight, I gotta sleep shortly.
Eliran (Halim): I figure table 1 can mention they're looking for a girl named Enera as well
Bill: yup. 'funny coincidence, we ran into a girl named Enera...'
Bill: Desii can open a thread up for a response from Afina/Elfriede, just tomorrow.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): üëå
Aldus (Jess): when googles  not having any of that fancy fantasy money talk
Bill: Nokri is such a meme.
Bill: Man I need more hours in the day.
Bill: Still would love to expand the world guide content, but between developing, work, shoots, blazblue...
Bill: Dizzy, can't forget dizzy.
Bill: Desii and Aldus could talk macguffin plant Jess.
Bill: for an aside.
Aldus (Jess): The crysalin thing? Ye gotta get some shit done around the hour rn tho
Bill: Yeah, I'd rather do it tomorrow when I'm working from home or later.
Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/12/15/NPCs.html Added Zaimar, the Fauns, Morras, Torin, am I forgetting any NPCs?
Bill: also Frin, and need to add San and whatever the other guy's name was in the faun manor.
Bill: also for what worth, new round for posting.
