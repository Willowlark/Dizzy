Bill: Let’s get some progress rolling on this, I’m really interested in applying fate to Aurii, if the system plays well.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): chara idea:
Tsunagu Kurihara
Quirk is Combo. The more times he does something successfully in a row, the better/stronger it gets. But when the combo breaks it immediately resets to 0.
Bill: That’s super cool.

Bill: Oh wow. Cool thing in Roll20 (a virtual tabletop site people use to play rpgs online) is that you can whisper via voice on their call platform. Never heard of that before.
I do what I want(tm): oh thats really cool
Bill: Bnha thing is going to be try out of that too. I’ve always been tentative on net gaming (too easy to be distracted) but it’s a hell of a lot easier to do with busy adult lives.
Bill: A couple hours one night a week would be doable without any travel and coordination.
