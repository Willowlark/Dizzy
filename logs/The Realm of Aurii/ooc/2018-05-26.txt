Afina (Georgia🍀): i need the "i wont say im in love" from hercules but with elfie or fina, and all the muses are just the other characters
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i cannot draw but damn that would be good shit_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Wow ive seen that movie at least 50 times
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But I don't remember that sing
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But YE
Eliran (Halim): how do you not remember that song its such a bop
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: cuz its not ~~BLESS MY SOUL~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~who puts the glad in gladiator~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Had to reference back to the beginning of table 2 for the letter that the cardinal sent, what the _fuck_ were our characters they're so different now omg
Afina (Georgia🍀): _throwback to Elfriede calling someone a child_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *oo I forget, who he call*
Nokri (Marisa): ghostbusters
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I wanted Elfriede to so much more of an asshole
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: OMG MARISA PLZ NO
Afina (Georgia🍀): Kailyn lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH WHAT HAPPENED TOM ELFRIEDE GOT SOFT
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Nobles exchange pleasantries, not physicalities.” /looks at aside 2, Afina you fuckin liar
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede was much more of a complainer early on too
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeahh, well with kailyn in the group it wanted hard
Afina (Georgia🍀): _ l m a o you're right_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede just really hasn't gotten to interact with alot of others
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Maybe he'll be more of a jerk again soon we'll see <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which is why the meeting of tables will be a blessing
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ya know
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: After his DEPRESSION
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk Elfriede's thought narration stay pretty consistent at least
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like he's less harsh interior as opposed to the knight boi exterior
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like in the laguz raid he gets distracted thinking about combing the bugs from his tail lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): DEPRESSION WOO
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmaooo true!
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: His thoughts will be the same he just might have a bit different outwards actions
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Little more brash I suppose?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: He's only talked with officials and afrin for a while
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And affin has been nothing but really nice to him so
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think everyone's personality really falls into place with the first laguz skirmish
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina definitely does and Elfriede evens out too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which makes sense it's one of the first big events and really tested our characters
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeahh
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 👌 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's also where Elfriede and Afina first connect too cause they have that SICKNASTY synchronized attack plan
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: WHATS THE WORD WERE GONNA USE TO KNOW WERE JUMPING OUT OF THE BUSHES
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: WHATS THE WORD
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: FINA PLZ
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~**it was just a bun**~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): _the attack word was help and no one ever even said it_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina be like "I don't like it but it's okay you kill people Elfriede cause nobles make good decisions". After the lego reveal I don't think that'll be the case 👀👀👀
Nokri (Marisa): omg have you seen voltron
it's like allura and keith
kind of a bit

afina and alfredo can make up by going on a space journey together
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah I said the same thing <@301927856240459777>

Aldus (Jess): Ohhhh yea! I said that too when we we're watching
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's been an hour I'm still reading the table 2 history
Afina (Georgia🍀): Throwback to Elfriede saying he prefers to _spar with clothes on_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: WHAT
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: WHAT CINTEXT
Afina (Georgia🍀): AFTER THE LEGO FIGHT
Afina (Georgia🍀): when he's shirtless and washing his shirt of the blood afrin asks to train
Afina (Georgia🍀): and she's all "you should get clothes on" and he's like "yes I prefer to spar with clothes on"
Afina (Georgia🍀): _how does one spar with clothes off HMMMM KNIGHT BOI_
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): The coordination of Afina and Elfriede becoming friends is really well coordinated reading back on the logs
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's not super forced or too fast/slow
Afina (Georgia🍀): GOOD TEAMWORK
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YEE WOO
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I SERIOUSLY CANT FIND THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT PERFERING SPARRING WITH CLOTHES ON SO IMMA PRETEND THAY AFINA WAS COMING ONTO HIM
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And he shut her down <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i cannot believe this, my sweet knowledge child would never_
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): EXPOSED
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh and like two lines after that
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Out of context Elfriede is some prime content
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: OMG THATS SO LEWD SOUNDING OUT IF CONTEXT
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: BOTH OF THOSE AGHHH
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ahh it's in the asides
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: "If you'll have me princess"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: "I hope I'm good enough for you."
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede is so under the radar lewd.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *so glad to see you out of those clothes Fina* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like Elfriede _do you know how to talk to girls_
Aldus (Jess): Um no
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): _ELFRIEDE THIS IS NOT HOW TO TALK TO GIRLS_
Aldus (Jess): That's exactly how elfriede should talk to Afina tho<:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: HES JUST PLAYFUL OKAY
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *Pins Afina during training* 

JUST PLAYFUL
Afina (Georgia🍀): _youre just a charge afrin this is nothing_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina has taken like no injuries in play by post: 1 nosebleed, 1 burn, 2 light cuts, 1 clawed leg
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede: fucking stabbed through the stomach
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Crushed ribs
Eliran (Halim): I forgot to hurt Eliran in my post last week woops
Eliran (Halim): Like his HP is at 1 but I forgot to write a description for what hit him
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~a smooth criminal~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah objectively Elfriede is doing his duty pretty well if he's getting so beat up and afrins like oh I just got a nosebleed
Aldus (Jess): Yea me too, I men Aldus says he's beat up but I didn't elaborate
Afina (Georgia🍀): _beat up your OCs cause you love them_
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Afina (Georgia🍀): How elfie and fina only hugged TWICE somehow
Afina (Georgia🍀): Everyone's getting a bigass hug in trisp, none of these babies know what physical affection is
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ❤ ❤ ❤
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Spead the love
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Aldus entire journal entry: "im touch starved someone help me"
Afina (Georgia🍀): THATS LIKE EVERYONE THO
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina be like: Elfriede is my first friend ever plz love me
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede be like: Idk how to talk to girls but PINCESS how do I deal with hugs
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri hasn't touched anyone ever
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran is the only wildcard
Eliran (Halim): Eliran can and will hug afina probably
Eliran (Halim): Maybe
Eliran (Halim): Eliran won't hug Aldus till they have a solid heart 2 heart
Eliran (Halim): ~~I low-key want Eliran to be the super french une bise type~~
Eliran (Halim): ~~like if Afina introduce Elfriede as a good friend he'd just be like "marvelous" and give the boy sudden greeting cheek kisses~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): DO IT
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Eliran is just gonna overwhelm the shit out of Elfriede
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~first hugs his girl~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: then kisses him
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede is gonna die
Afina (Georgia🍀): RIP
Eliran (Halim): Reason doesn't give Afina the kisses is because hugs are technically higher level and she's smol so it's a low-key pain
Eliran (Halim): Bae would Eliran hug Afina or would she hug him
Eliran (Halim): I feel like she would hug him
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like he would be like OPEN ARMS and whoosh she run into him
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause they're childhood friends so that's how children hug
Eliran (Halim): Depends on scenario to 
Who sees who first
Eliran (Halim): If Eliran sees Afina first he sneaks around and taps her on the wrong shoulder
Afina (Georgia🍀): FUCK THATS TOO LEGIT
Afina (Georgia🍀): New challenge: describe your two characters interactions based on how they hug
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri & Afina: Nokri lovingly embraces Afina and Afina just pats her head awkwardly
Eliran (Halim): Afina and Eliran: Afina runs over into an open armed hug, tight squeeze. If prolonged, light squeeze and Eliran gently pats her back in a caring manner
Eliran (Halim): ~~Afina and Elfriede: slightly awkward mutual hugging, elfriede is flustered trying to hide at least one bulge ~~
Eliran (Halim): Nokri &Eliran: they begrudgingly hold each other for a few seconds before letting go and not talking about it
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^ Aldus and Afina is like that, at least in the beginning it will be
