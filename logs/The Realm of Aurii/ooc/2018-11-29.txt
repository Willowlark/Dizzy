No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): the way i'm writing robin in this next post makes her sound like a big jerk, and she kind of is (to Judas)
think of her as one of a radical feminists or a super religious catholic. she's not a representation of every person of native american heritage in this world. the city has a bunch of native americans who were assimilated into everyday society (forcibly or not is up to you to decide) and Robin is more like this weird girl living in the forest (a la avatar's freedom fighters kind of).
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Is Robin a native? Or more like a forest spirit?
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): naw she's not a forest spirit, she's 100% human. native american, maybe has some slight blessings by the forest because she spends all her time there and is very kind to the forest
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ohh okay,I've been seeing her as some form of Demi human like a Satyr or something similar, like dark skin and blacked out eyes with a tlers or something
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): No idea where I got that from
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): never fear we shall have more non-humans in the future
