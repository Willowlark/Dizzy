Bill: I am thinking I’ll invite Denny and Sam Hill (you may or may not have met them at various family things) to play. My parents played d&d with theirs way back when, and they’re not otaku but nerds. I’ve also been reconsidering Erik, but he’s Switzerland in BNE drama and we, while clearly the best side, are a side in that.
Bill: Tho I suppose I’ll wait till the ball is really rolling.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): <@184437198865563648> what part of the ending of the Aurii one are we retcoonning? Or did we actually meet the laguz
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I was thinking of brainstorming a bit tonight
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): WOO BRAINSTORM
Bill: You guys left Trisp, there was no pursuit party out of the city, it is up to you if you were recognized when leaving.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): For Afina, I’m gonna say that her dad was spooked by the attacks in Eraia and recalled her back home for her safety
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): In case that’s relevant to Elfriedes trajectory
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Okay 👍 time to think
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~time to make more sads~~
Bill: Remember that you’re starting your story, it gets crossed, you get it back, rinse and repeat, one more rinse repeat, then you get it back.
Bill: So don’t write too far ahead, cause you need to work with someone else and then someone else else.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I think to start it’s just gonna be Afina sending out the letters inviting peeps
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s a pretty convenient tie to establish
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeahhhh I'm gonna write the entire thing
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): How long has it been? One year?
