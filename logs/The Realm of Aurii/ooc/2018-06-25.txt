Nokri (Marisa): Eliran proceeds to sell aldus a 10 pack of oxiclean and 3 snuggies
Aldus (Jess): Lmao
Aldus (Jess): "now this is from Elbia, you know the Elbians always make good stuff"
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: what did you think I was sleeping with people to get us hotel rooms and caravans
Aldus (Jess): ~~yea I have no idea what to say at this point 😱~~
Eliran (Halim): I changed my mind, gonna rewrite that response later
Eliran (Halim): Cyrrently at starbucks drive through about 20 min from home
Aldus (Jess): 👌
Dizzy: GM posts come out today.
Bill: Which I’d like to know where every one plans on going in the morning for. Aldus and Desii are going to the monastery to ask questions about Enera, Afina is training with Torin, but what about <@!288513265661902858> <@!351785752197201920> and <@!301927856240459777> ?
Nokri (Marisa): ~~shopping spree~~ nokri will likely try to wander around and try to get some potion materials ~~and find out more about the princess~~
Bill: So the other three are going to be doing those scenes for a bit, do you want Nokri to get involved in a scene while shopping, or just do a one post for it and move on?
Bill: I can also just leave it to you, let you guide yourself.
Nokri (Marisa): i can just do a post and see where stuff goes to move on. she can continuously wander until needed again.
Bill: Consider it like a vn where you do one scene a day. That’s the kind of feel I’m seeing.
Eliran (Halim): I want eliran to run into Elfriede, not sure how but I want them to cross paths without eliran actively seeking him out 
Kinda bump 8nto each other
Bill: Doable. Need Tom on board is all.
Eliran (Halim): <@351471675843411978> I'll close up aside when I go on break
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah I'm def on board
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I think it's good timing
Nokri (Marisa): eliran turns over and slowly falls asleep while aldus is still just standing there
Eliran (Halim): Aldus: we were having a conversation 
Eliran: shhhhh nap time
Nokri (Marisa): am able to aside for a couple hours in between workin' if needed
Bill: okay, so where are <@!351785752197201920> and <@!288513265661902858> going respectively, or where would be a good place for them to run into each other?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Soo Elfriede is going to have trouble sleeping tonight and will wake up a bit late (for him) 

Then will think Afina is probably busy, plus he's embarrassed so he'll want to leave the monastery.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: At least for a bit, either market, patrol, baths... Prob patrol, then baths
Bill: They going to bump into each other nekkid aren't they.
Eliran (Halim): Eliran probably gonna need to shower 
He also would probably head around the market cause he didnt the day before in favor of delivering mail to church
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH MY GOD PLZ BATH HOUSE ASIDE
Afina (Georgia🍀): that'd be hilarious
Eliran (Halim): Can we bath house
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah *let them be nekkid*
Afina (Georgia🍀): This game needs some comic relief anyways
Bill: whose fault is that.
Eliran (Halim): I like it 
"Wait do you have a tail "
Eliran (Halim): "Oh dude you gonna have it rough... or should I say ruff "
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I think eliran should def notice but maybe not say anything yet
Eliran (Halim): Eliran _oh afina probably knows_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran: stark naked "so you're gonna be good to Afina right"
Eliran (Halim): Eliran _good for her finally getting over her racism_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede: desperately holding onto towel "I'm tRYinG"
Afina (Georgia🍀): If Eliran knows then afina's gonna have a better healing process too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause Eliran will be like "you're dumb"
Aldus (Jess): if afina gon get mad at eliran when she finds out he knew and didnt tell her?
Aldus (Jess): ~~also doesnt that make the logo reveal not the lego reveal~~
Bill: ^
Eliran (Halim): It's still a legu reveal
Eliran (Halim): Cause it's important reveal for afina 
Eliran has no stakes
Eliran (Halim): Tbh  hed probably assume she knows already
Bill: Best not fuck with the formula.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Possibly
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran could see something suspicious
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like Elfriede bathed fully clothed lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): But not know exactly _what_ it is
Eliran (Halim): I dont see why eliran finding out matters
Bill: Elfriede: the water feels good under my armor.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm washing my clothes AND my body ELIRAN
Eliran (Halim): El8ran is also fully clothed
Bill: It undermines that Elfriede and his family desperately hide this secret from everyone, including superior officers, suitors, and the church?
Aldus (Jess): ^
Bill: If he's going to slip up now, how did he get through 24 years without slipping up before?
Aldus (Jess): by now elfirede should be pro at hiding his tail
Bill: ~~it goes right up the butt~~
Eliran (Halim): Oh right 
I forgot this is a major secret ™
Bill: right. For example, a serious concern with Yuria MIA is that her status as a Laguz could be revealed.
Eliran (Halim): I think Eliran being suspicious about something then 
What if elfriede wears like a shower diaper
Aldus (Jess): swim trunks eflyyyyy
Eliran (Halim): Like q fundoshi
Bill: My recommendation is to leave the laguz reveal to the two planning it, and set up your own, independent arc with Elfriede. Something you can continue even while Afina and Elfriede are TEMPORARILY separated.
Afina (Georgia🍀): A SPEEDO
Bill: Elfriede and Afina can kind of deal with not talking to each other by starting things up with the other members of the group.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Tbh I think it's fine if eliran at least suspects it
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: He's observant
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: As long as he doesn't mess with the actual Afina reveal I'm sure it's fine
Eliran (Halim): Eliran sees the tail 
"Dude really? Your a furry. Keep your tail buttpl7g out of the bathroom"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I leave it you guys. I do recommend finding the character between Elfriede and Eliran tho. I think we all can acknowledge the power of a character after Knight Light.
Aldus (Jess): the character between?
Afina (Georgia🍀): nani
Bill: Character arc.
Aldus (Jess): ah
Aldus (Jess): yea we could all use that
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bath house is gonna be a good aside I'm feelin it
Eliran (Halim): EL O EL aside todayyyy
Afina (Georgia🍀): Man I'm still not thrilled with that ship name but it works
Eliran (Halim): Question of laguz are like kinda animally
Eliran (Halim): Do they potentially have animal junk
Aldus (Jess): oh god plz no
Bill: No. Grade A anime animal people, literal only difference is ears and tail.
Aldus (Jess): thank god
Eliran (Halim): Kk
Eliran (Halim): Just wanted to check
Bill: because we're going to have different scenes going on at once, I think we're going to spread the scenes out to individual tables.
Aldus (Jess): lol desii asking about enera is going to be so weird cuz its just gonna be billy talking to himself
Bill: Weeee
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede has wolf peen
Aldus (Jess): NO STAHP TOM
Aldus (Jess): afinas never gonna take you back
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina: yeah I think I've embraced a sexuality
Bill: Or I play up Desii as a more shy character so cool guy Aldus can save the day.
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): Who's Desii asking? Afina?
Bill: Nah, she’ll likely end up talking to some generic bishop.
Bill: She’s not going to get anywhere tho.
Aldus (Jess): Aldus doesnt know alot about enera tho, desii is more emotionally invested in it i think it would make sence for her to take charge since she is passionate about it
Bill: Hhmm
Bill: We shall see.
Aldus (Jess): are we gonna talk to the creepy dude? i was informed that i missed something about a creepy dude like a month ago
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oh the bishop
Aldus (Jess): yea
Aldus (Jess): i missed that
Bill: Dunno.
Bill: Will get to that after I’m on the train.
Aldus (Jess): whooooo!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wait so what's the split
Afina (Georgia🍀): _where is nokri in all of this, that's very suspicious_
Eliran (Halim): nokri is getting kidnapped again
Aldus (Jess): probabl
Aldus (Jess): i think its:
Afina is training
Elfy and Eli are gonna do some "BRO YOU BETTER NOT HURT HER" time
Desii and Aldi are going to the monastery to see wtf up
and Nokri is going to ~~steal things~~ wader around market place
Bill: That’s basically it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I almost feel bad that nokri is alone
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~she's actually watching Afina through a window~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): She can't really be integrated into anything tho
Aldus (Jess): i mean she could tag along with aldi desii?
Bill: fuccccck this is a lot of writing.
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> <@!288513265661902858> , do you need a GM intro or does one of you just want to set the scene in the bath house and the other can enter from there?
Bill: I don't see any reason for me to guide you in this instance, you guys can rock your own thing.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Don't you mean... rock out with their cock out
Aldus (Jess): Basically
Bill: Keep dem fantasies to yourself. 😛
Bill: would it have been racist for Dain and Saila to give Aldus something to sniff out Enera by?
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): React 👌 for no and 😱 for yes
Aldus (Jess): I'mma go with no, but would say he offered rather then them having been like "hey dog boi, sniff sniff"
Bill: Tom, Hal, thoughts/
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> since he blazin.
Aldus (Jess): Damn that guy's a dick
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): wow what a split
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: guess for posts <@!288513265661902858> <@!184437198865563648>  well do our entrance and stuff while the converstaion will be an aside?
Bill: You can use the post to start things as well.
Bill: You okay with setting the scene yourselves?
Aldus (Jess): You guys ok with setting the mood for yourselves? Maybe might some candles?
Eliran (Halim): I was thinking cherry blossoms
Aldus (Jess): Oh yea with the bath? That should go real nice
Aldus (Jess): Stop and fantasy lush on your way get a bath bomb
