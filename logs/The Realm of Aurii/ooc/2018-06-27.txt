Eliran (Halim): stay out of our table

Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~thats a distinct reason for afina to go to the table~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~but Afina wants to see elfy nakkie~~
Aldus (Jess): Yea!
Afina (Georgia🍀): BOOM there it is
Afina (Georgia🍀): i cant believe eliran sees elfriede naked before afina
Eliran (Halim): lets be real
Eliran (Halim): if anybody saw Elfriede naked before Afina
Eliran (Halim): it makes sense that its Eliran
Aldus (Jess): He was in the military, other people have seen him nakie
Eliran (Halim): i meant PC
Aldus (Jess): Ohhhh ok
Aldus (Jess): Technically he not nakie
Aldus (Jess): And Afina saw him shirtless last night
Afina (Georgia🍀): _shirtless is not nakie_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina wants the whole enchilada
Aldus (Jess): Yea but Elfie still has a towel on
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~not for long~~
Eliran (Halim): ~~Eliran steals the towel~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~why do you want to ruin elfriede so badly~~
Elfriede (Tom): are they calling *that* an enchilada now

Elfriede (Tom): Both are well written 👌
Elfriede (Tom): I like the details Aldus notices and his new look ™
Elfriede (Tom): Also Afina gathering spell power from Elfriedes naked body 👌 👌 👌 👌
Elfriede (Tom): A valid source
Afina (Georgia🍀): ...... suuuuuuure that's how it happened
Elfriede (Tom): Im almost certain that's what happened 👌
Elfriede (Tom): In all seriousness it did come off as her spell got more powerful from thinking about him
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): #character development
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afrin was all "yeah I can conjure stuff cause I believe in myself" up until she got to the detonation spell, which she was only ever able to do because she feared for elfriedes life
Afina (Georgia🍀): SO by accidentally thinking about him again she could do it bam bam
Elfriede (Tom): 👌 👌 👌
Aldus (Jess): Wait what Afinas thirst for Elfriede helped her magic
Aldus (Jess): Damn I better read that
Aldus (Jess): First I have to respond to this aside in which Aldus is very confused
Aldus (Jess): *lightly touches nokris hand* "im sensing some jealousy here"
Nokri (Marisa): "don't touch me i'm gucci"
Nokri (Marisa): "anyway you were saying?"
Aldus (Jess): poor desii never did anything wrong
Aldus (Jess): Aldus is now accepting girlfriend applications please send your resume and cover letter

Aldus (Jess): things are heating up in the aurii fandom
Bill: wait what.
Aldus (Jess): wait what for what?
Bill: I haven't caught up on everything, don't you involve Desii.
Aldus (Jess): it seems nokri has a bit of a jealously problem <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): its ok desii can just stay blissfully unaware
Nokri (Marisa): nokri: lights desii on fire
desii: "oh, good morning! did you sleep well?"
nokri: ಠ_ಠ
Aldus (Jess): OMG NO
Aldus (Jess): mawisa this aside is spicy and the suspense is killing me, of course i cant talk cuz i made tyou wait all day for a respose
Nokri (Marisa): O I'M SORRY I WAS READING MANGA HERE I GO
Aldus (Jess): if you have a certain direction you want this to go tell me cuz collaboration is fun ✨

Nokri (Marisa): o wait i meant to put a thing about desii in there too
Nokri (Marisa): yehaw
Nokri (Marisa): ✨

Aldus (Jess): no not at all!
Aldus (Jess): im crying poor desii
Aldus (Jess): nokri not gonna ike aldi sticking up for desii

Eliran (Halim): How tall is elfriede
Eliran (Halim): I ask cause I think I set eliran to 6 ft and the height difference is important for what he may do
Aldus (Jess): Elfriede is 5’5” 135 lbs 23 years old.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina gonna materialize over aside two like _"Eliran don't you dare embarrass me."_
Aldus (Jess): how tall is afina?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lil bit shorter than Elfie
Afina (Georgia🍀): When they hug they're about the same height I think that's the only description I've really given lol
Aldus (Jess): i live how tom make himself shorter in PBP than irl
Aldus (Jess): o btw elfriede is wolf laguz, but hes actually a fox laguz
Aldus (Jess): hes small and has brown hair with a hint of red and from that one meme drawing is tail is a short boi
Afina (Georgia🍀): Laguz reveal gets botched cause his tail is so small that Afina doesn't see it
Bill: ~~tail~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Everyone lives happily ever after :V
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😬
Aldus (Jess): 😱
Aldus (Jess): i have t respond to this aside but im trying to do work a little bit first and also my inner aldus is sweating nervously
Afina (Georgia🍀): _inner aldus_
Nokri (Marisa): he ran so far he's inside jess now

Afina (Georgia🍀): That makes Marisa a ticking time bomb
Aldus (Jess): 😱
Aldus (Jess): shit your right
Aldus (Jess): OH NO thats cant happen

Afina (Georgia🍀): Only half that's a little better
Aldus (Jess): hopefully soon no one is racist! 👍
Elfriede (Tom): 🙌 🙌 🙌
Elfriede (Tom): I'm assuming I'm too late for break lmao
Aldus (Jess): desii is the tallest girl wtf lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg if Aldus took over Jess' body he would be way confused
Bill: huh. I didn't intend for that.
Aldus (Jess): how tall IS nokri?
Aldus (Jess): aldus: "whys my hair so short, why do i have boobs, where are my ears?!, wheres my peen, my tail, why am i short?! my hairs all wrong!, at least my eyes are vaguely the same"
Nokri (Marisa): 5' i think?
Aldus (Jess): so its nokri then afina then desii
Nokri (Marisa): a relatable height because i don't know what it's like being any taller
Aldus (Jess): Nokri: "If you like Desii so much why dont you just go marry her!" 
"NO WAIT don't"
Nokri (Marisa): "A toast! To the lovely couple!"
3/4 the wedding party just passes out after drinking
Aldus (Jess): desiis one of them
Nokri (Marisa): desii's keeps her knocked out for significantly longer than everyone else

Eliran (Halim): ~~eliran wouldn't have minded probably~~
Aldus (Jess): add him to the list
Eliran (Halim): I assumed he was near the top of the list of people willing to hop on the Aldi train
Aldus (Jess): ~~this is becoming an Adlus hared real quick~~
Aldus (Jess): yea see i thought that train didn't actually exist until like last week
Afina (Georgia🍀): Its cause we got +2 characters to aldus' sphere of influence
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eliran was like the conductor of the train from the get go
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri JUST thawed out

Elfriede got a nice view of Elirans dick probably
Eliran (Halim): I mean if he looked toward it
Afina (Georgia🍀): I was gonna say he got a threat and a face full of ~~veen~~ peen
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's an interesting scene though cause up until then Eliran hasn't really been aggressive when it came to Afina
Afina (Georgia🍀): His whole schtick was like "ah my old friend!"
Afina (Georgia🍀): But this shows he's actually very concerned with her well being, as well as their aside the night before
