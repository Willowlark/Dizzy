Afina (Georgia🍀): MMM YES POST TIME HAS COME
Afina (Georgia🍀): How's Afrin gonna take this
Afina (Georgia🍀): She could either play along and then trick the cardinal
Nokri (Marisa): Like a champ
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or just straight up FITE
Bill: ngl more interested in Elfriede, cause the Cardinal is his direct superior.
Afina (Georgia🍀): That too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe Afrin will wait for Elfie
Afina (Georgia🍀): Depending on what he does, she'll follow
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~she may hate his guts but it's obvious that he's more experienced in combat than she is~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tom hmu when you start writing your post
Afina (Georgia🍀): Gotta write in some INTENSE eye contact
Elfriede (Tom): Oo ye

Elfriede (Tom): I'm mostly done with my post now
Elfriede (Tom): I'mma add some detail with the eye contact
Elfriede (Tom): <@245270932602486784>  is there anything specific I need to know before I post? Like interaction wise?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede and Afina need to have some acknowledge of each other basically
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause Afina is taking whatever Elfriede does as a signal for her to do
Afina (Georgia🍀): Should I wait for Tom to post to roll my dice? Probably right
Bill: Dice are for *last* round.
Bill: That said, you didn't attack Morras or anything so asides from defense you can't do anything.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Man one year later and I'm still shit at dice lmao

Bill: I’m waiting for dice. She’s not going to have the will power to move without the side goal being cleared.
Eliran (Halim): Ohhh crap I didnt see that side goal
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh when do I get dice for this round
