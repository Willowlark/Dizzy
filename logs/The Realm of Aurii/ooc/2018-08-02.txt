Dizzy: GM posts come out today.

Bill: I would like to do posts today, <@!301927856240459777> if Nokri is going to do a something posting now would be good. <@!351785752197201920> is the only one awake of the satellite group, so he can post them getting closer to the fight or if he misses it it's not a big deal.
Nokri (Marisa): Ye I was planning on it when I get home I’m on my easazzaay
Nokri (Marisa): Waaay
Elfriede (Tom): Either way it's fine
Nokri (Marisa): Biru are you in a rush to post
Am almost home but might need to stop for a moment for food
Nokri (Marisa): If u in a hurry you can go ahead but if not i pinky pwomise I will post asap
Bill: nah, go ahead
Nokri (Marisa): lol @ aldus pointing out the nokri passing out thing
also were any people attracted by the explosion of their church or did it go unnoticed
Aldus (Jess): stelth explody
Nokri (Marisa): nokri sees tiny blonde girl with freckles
"uh excuse me this look is copyrighted, you owe me money."
Nokri (Marisa): biru should we expect rando townies to start showing up or nah or is that a myster
Bill: Not immediately.
Nokri (Marisa): would anyone rather nokri stay put on the ground? i was considering having her run around and try to get back inside so she can reach the second floor to get to priest guy since she isn't as dexterous as to catapult herself from a tree, but that would require her to leave the immediate area. might possibly run past hime-sama and secret dog.
Aldus (Jess): it fine wif me
Bill: Tom , you're aware that Raive is still in the room, as is Eliran and Enera?
Elfriede (Tom): Oh only some were knocked out? Kk lemme fix

Afina (Georgia🍀): Hal: "YEAH he is"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Me: "he's gonna get so angry that he becomes a laguz"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hal: "no his final form is a corporate business man"
Eliran (Halim): He wont have to fight
Eliran (Halim): He'll own the nation's economy, and make the church his property
Eliran (Halim): Like the good ol days
Afina (Georgia🍀): Gotta post for Afina guys
Afina (Georgia🍀): "She is still knocked out, RIP"
Bill: Holy fuck there’s a lot going on.
