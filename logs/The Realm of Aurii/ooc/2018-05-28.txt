Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!351471675843411978> haleeeeem will be good to aside soon
Aldus (Jess): Ok d and d is still happening but I should be able to do both?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh damn
Aldus (Jess): We're doing this thing right now where our party is split so we are kind if taking turns right now so I'll have breaks
Nokri (Marisa): “sorry guys I need a break from dnd for online dnd”
Aldus (Jess): Basically
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: We're split into table 1 and table 2 in irl dnd
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: We fell down 2 separate pits
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: The need to draw my dnd character looking angrily at my Aurii character has spawned
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede was semi based on him although they look totally different. Elfriede ended up being completely different but INITIALLY
Eliran (Halim): ello
Eliran (Halim): time 2 asid
Afina (Georgia🍀): _looks on in jealousy cause we're talking to a cardinal we can't aside on table 2_
Nokri (Marisa): be like "excuse us we have to go to the bathroom" and have an aside
Afina (Georgia🍀): /cardinal definitely assumes they're up to something
Nokri (Marisa): like that scene in gsnk where they're pretending to have a mixer
and every single time the one guy speaks nozaki is like "sakura we have to go to the bathroom" and they just go "omg what do you think about what he just said"
Eliran (Halim): i loved that episode
Eliran (Halim): they eventually all went inside the bathroom
Eliran (Halim): including the guy
Eliran (Halim): i mean 'the guy'
Nokri (Marisa): i can't find the chapter ; ~ ;
they do a real mixer later on in the manga that also goes horribly
Aldus (Jess): You're opening ya?
Nokri (Marisa): AHAV
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *wut a mixer*
Nokri (Marisa): in japan it's when a bunch of single people get together, usually an even number of guys and gals. it's like a giant blind date
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ahhhhh yeah ive seen that, i gotcha
Nokri (Marisa): [goes into aside 2 with desii and stalks the others]
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: (halims jess will brb, just finishing combat)
Eliran (Halim): 👍
Afina (Georgia🍀): wait is table 1 in trisp?
Nokri (Marisa): I don't think so? i thought they returned to where they were before but i'm not certain
Afina (Georgia🍀): theyre in the town right before trisp so thats okie, the tables will meet soon
Aldus (Jess): LOL at Eliran accusing Aldus of walking off all pissed off into the woods to wank it after battle 😂
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: Either you got some actual problem, or your masturbating
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: Theres no in between,
Afina (Georgia🍀): _no_ in between
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: Except for maybe hate sex with a clone
Afina (Georgia🍀): ***nothing***

Nokri (Marisa): !lewd
Nokri (Marisa): desii back me up here
Nokri (Marisa): thank
Aldus (Jess): Need Aldi being cute and laughing behind his hand
Eliran (Halim): Eliran: Ok time to be serious and help a bro
Eliran to Eliran: Ok but dick jokes 
Eliran: Why not both...?
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats how asides are theyre like half memes half feels
Nokri (Marisa): As a heads up that the characters don’t know
Nokri would be open to talking and would be kind
She’s just very on the fence about Desii in particular but the rest of the group she’d be an open book for
Nokri (Marisa): “Do you think there’s good in her?”
She gets punched and loses a tooth
that’s it that’s the last good she had
Aldus (Jess): Aldus morns the death of the last good part in Nokri 🙏
Nokri (Marisa): He picks it up and keeps it in a jat
Aldus (Jess): Probably
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: TwT
Nokri (Marisa): aurii chibi but everyone gets turned into a ~~furry~~ literal animal
aldus is like "sweet, finally."
afina is having a panic attack.
Aldus (Jess): 🙌
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I love it
Eliran (Halim): Is that an aside end ...?
Aldus (Jess): Yea I think so 👌
Bill: noooow I see how Alura is Afina.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani
Bill: i'm watching voltron.
Aldus (Jess): LOL
Bill: I should write posts.
Bill: One more voltron episode.
Aldus (Jess): Opp I never posted
Bill: Posts when I get home.
Bill: Sucks I have to do each paragraph of Desii posts separately.
Eliran (Halim): Rip
Also eyyyyy we've arrived
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Maybe I can find an Eraian to teach me light magic" AFINA POPS UP, WHAT ABOUT A CALLORIAN BEYOTCH
Bill: Afina: "I've killed dozen of Laguz... bandits, bandits, with my magic!"
Desii: 😱
Eliran (Halim): Afina: I thought killing with magic was bad to but MY GOD look at what it can do
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> for matters of convenience, your orders can detail you escorting Afina until she returns to Theanovene borders.
Afina (Georgia🍀): its been the assumption that he was only to excort her to trisp for a while, maybe the cardinal says like "btw youre bringing her home right"
Bill: Cardinal has nothing to do with those orders.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye he can read da paper tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): which elfriede apparently didnt _read closely enough_
Aldus (Jess): So Aldus's only reason for being here in eraia is for that flower yea?
Bill: Only reason I know of. Dain and Saila shared their tale to Aldus as well, and you can have any reason you want to be there, you're Aldi.
Aldus (Jess): Oh true yea that's it
Aldus (Jess): Na those are the only reasons
