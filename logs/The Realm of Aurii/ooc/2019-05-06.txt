Bill: As soon as everyone playing has backstory and how they got to the party ironed out, we can run the game.
Bill: I guess I'm waiting on everyone, rather than setting a deadline and running with whoever is read.
Bill: You still use that bluetooth keyboar I gave you Tom?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): No actually
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Not lately at least
Bill: ummu.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ***a new love interest has entered the fray***
Bill: I'mma have to give San a whole character bio aren't I.
Bill: Lemme know if you have any head canons you have in mind.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YUP
Bill: Like with Yuria, then I'll fill in around the headcanon.
Bill: ~~oh man is Yuria going to approve of Elfie boinking the help~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NO BOINKING
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ....YET
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Anyways San is very very responsibleand takes her duties seriously, however she is semi starry-eyed and niave with some things
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm guessing she's trusted enough to know about the family secret but she doesn't know that Afina knows.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm thinking possibly has some repressed jealousy abrewing for Afina.
Bill: Who the fuck was the guy butler. I dun't recall.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OOPS ME NIETHER
Aldus Larian (Jess): love triangle time?
Bill: I'm feeling she's a little nosy and a bit of a snoop.
Bill: ~~I fucking hate love triangles please no~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Tbh having another female character around isn't bad though.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TRIANGLE TRIANGLE TRIANGLE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao, it's unfortunately setting up for one but hopefully we can managae it more adultly
Bill: Nokri is... Nokri, and Afina is not the main character.
NüÜóri (Marisa): üî∫
Bill: Whatever happens happens. It's not like I'm going to ban it or something. If the characters do form a love triangle that just means everyone's playing their characters.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Id love for San to be tied to someone else's backstory
Elfriede Faun (Tom): At least lightly
NüÜóri (Marisa): Day one: everyone forms a physical triangle at the party
Aldus Larian (Jess): double love triangle
Bill: Oh I did put her and Nath into the NPC directory.
Bill: Still lines up with what you were saying.
Bill: I can't remember if she was a leggo.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah exactly like how she made fun of Elfriede for his beard
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You never mentioned Lego traits in dialogue but I'll leave it up to you
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I imagined her as not
Bill: Tho... if anything she'd be a cat leggo, so my thought of having her be an old friend of Aldo is out.
Bill: Nah, we can leave her not.
Bill: F for Atalantia never coming back.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): F
NüÜóri (Marisa): F
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is San trained in combat?
Bill: No.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm unsure
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Coocoo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Atalanta as npc plz
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But I'll leave her as very intelligent
Bill: She's savvy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): coocoo?
Bill: Rather than intelligent.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): she crazy?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Intelligence not the right word
Bill: Yeee.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Smart
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Not school smart
Bill: ~~Ah yes, good NPCs~~
Bill: Always exciting.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~you can still be intellegent and not be school smart js~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I think he just means the dnd intelligence
Bill: *It's not a dig at people who aren't school smart, it's to differentiate and show her strengths better*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Which means your total knowledge of thingd
Elfriede Faun (Tom): While wisdom is more of how smart you art
Bill: Afina is "intelligent". San is "Savvy". Both words mean smart, but they give different connotations as to how.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): San is definitely smarter than Elfriede for sure
Bill: Afina can learn a new spell in a day. San can figure out which politician is corrupt based on how he's interacting with the local Prince.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He's a dumbass
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And I'd be down for Atalantia becoming an npc
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Id understand if you didn't want that tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Since it is her character
Bill: It's a toss up. I don't think Allison is going to come back...
Bill: But I don't want too many NPCs involved with the party.
Bill: It's hard enough playing every other character in the world, then me playing two characters in the party as well could get hairy.
Bill: ~~I half assed playing Desii rather frequently~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): She doesn't need to be in active combat all the time I wouldn't think
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just in and out
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hi bye
Bill: Yeah. That I can consider.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Like another ninja
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ~~Is nokri a ninja~~
Bill: ~~apparently the maid is a ninja~~

Bill: ~~like you don't want to already but~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yasss character
Aldus Larian (Jess): how do i make the write
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have taken a shower, i have on comfy clothes, a soft blankie and a cup of coffee, this creates the writing yes?
NüÜóri (Marisa): have you tried turning it off and on again?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): are any cities big and maybe casually excepting of legos but not like super excepting? not in eraia tho aldus hates that place
Aldus Larian (Jess): he told me
Bill: The capitals of the Etrina and Torshan regions of Callora would work. For simplicities sake, Etrina and Torshan are the capital city as well. Etrina considers laguz second class but doesn‚Äôt do anything to them cause that‚Äôd be petty and frowned upon, and because you‚Äôre a wolf you‚Äôd have the ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs from Wynne he‚Äôs cool‚Äù effect. Torshan is particularly harsh on cat leggo, but since you‚Äôre a big strong wolf you‚Äôd be fine.
Aldus Larian (Jess): is world guide not pinned or am i blind?
Bill: New one might not be. Aurii.us
