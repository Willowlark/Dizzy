NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): this might go easier if I write it in second person (more like a choose your own adventure), but majority said they prefer third person. I could write it simpler so it's easier for everybody, but then details would be left out and it may leave more questions.

does anyone have any input or do they think it's fine as-is?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm fine with second person if it's easier for you!
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): is everyone ok with suddenly being a teenage pointy eared girl caught in a thrilling 1900s romantic mystery
Bill: Yes.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): great then biru's got dibs on cosplaying amelia at zenkaikon no takebacks
