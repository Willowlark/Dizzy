Bill: That was. Something.
Bill: Also world guide is a long fucking boi. I wrote it on vacation I think.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah,we also had numerous battles in there with mostly bandit laguz in the south
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my table just ran from everything. aldus saved nokris life once tho
Leanna: wheres the smut
Leanna: i was hoping for explanation of that
Leanna: lmao
Dirty Lego (Tom): ~~in my Google docs~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): Uhhh my and Georgias character had this flirty trust thing going on. And while they were staying in the monastery they got pretty close to doing it but Elfriede (my character back off)
Leanna: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Mostly for fear of revealing his tail to the relatively racist Afina
Leanna: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Leanna: ~~the tail sure~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Leanna: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Elfriede hates his heritage (as his whole family does) and they cut off third furry ears to pretend to be human
Dirty Lego (Tom): But the tail being attached to the spine was deemed too dangerous to cut off
Dirty Lego (Tom): (was the bullshit reason I made)
Dirty Lego (Tom): So they keep it coiled in their pants like corgis
Leanna: awwww
Leanna: thats fucked
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they keep it in their pants
Leanna: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Dirty Lego (Tom): He's not edgey tho I swear, just a little haughty
Erik: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Okay a little edgey
Dirty Lego (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Each character has their own way of fighting. Usually by using different weapons (cept Nokri)
Dirty Lego (Tom): Elfriede is a duelist and uses a rapier and party dagger
Leanna: im gonna have to make a cheat sheet of characters
Leanna: names are hard
Dirty Lego (Tom): Their will be a character page channel you can check!
Leanna: oh LIT
Leanna: ok
Dirty Lego (Tom): Ye!
Erik: THERE'S A SHIPPING CHART ASDFGHJKL
Dirty Lego (Tom): ~~also Hal's character was invloved for a while but he didn't have much story impact so don't worry about it~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): OH YEAH FUCK
Dirty Lego (Tom): FORGOT THAT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA and the fan art tab has drawings
Leanna: ~~wheres the shipping chart üëÄ ~~
Erik: http://www.aurii.us/article/2018/03/14/aurii-shipping.html
Leanna: üëÄ  i see i see
Dirty Lego (Tom): Knight Light, how could I forget
Dirty Lego (Tom): (Afina is a light mage)
Bill: Did you ship knight light?
Dizzy: I ship Knight Light!
Bill: Not you XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LMAO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
Dirty Lego (Tom): ME TOO
Bill: I forget the other triggered response.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Also you can roll dice!
Dizzy: No, it isn't post day.
Bill: Oh, is it post day yet?
Dirty Lego (Tom): /r 2d6
Sidekick: <@351785752197201920>:  `2d6`  = (3+5) = 8
Leanna: oh dear, big confuse
Leanna: we will get there when we get there tho
Dirty Lego (Tom): That fine!
Leanna: i forgot dice are a thing
Bill: Yup. No rush take it slow.
Erik: /r 3d8
Sidekick: <@386874959009415170>:  `3d8`  = (7+3+2) = 12
Dirty Lego (Tom): Our old post schedule was 2 times a week in the glory days
Erik: oh neato
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it still confuses me
Dirty Lego (Tom): And we got up to like 7 paragraphs per post
Dirty Lego (Tom): There's so much backlog ahhhh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~should aldus and nokri have a ship name?~~
Bill: Everyone needs a ship name, this is a RWBY fandom group.
Bill: Wushu didn‚Äôt help with post length. That was one of the reasons I wanted to change to Fate, Fate doesn‚Äôt require details to get dice so you don‚Äôt have to fluff your posts.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): EXCITED FOR FRESH MEAT WOOOO
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So maybe to integrate Erik and Leanna‚Äôs character, Afinas father invites some peeps or something
Leanna: ~~high key just really excited to make a character, which is my favorite part of everything~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): I KNOW RIGHT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): big mood
Dirty Lego (Tom): Making a character is dope
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): WOOOO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we could also make them connections of other players depending
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~no the best part is destroying your character~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): OH SHIT YOU AKSO RIGHT
Leanna: <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Georgia is right.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh yeah and what Jess said
Bill: Also character connections are super important.
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's Google to have backstory with other characters if you like
Dirty Lego (Tom): Even just a touch
Bill: PLEASEEEE don‚Äôt play loners.
Leanna: i dont think i could
Leanna: lmao
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I want to try to avoid the trap of one person feeling like the main character this time, so connections would be welcome
Leanna: what does that mean? like connections established before gameplay?
Leanna: ~~what is a connection~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea like instead ov everyone meeting at the party maybe another character would take you as a guest, maybe you already know them
Leanna: oooo ok gotcha
Erik: so basically you're not just some rando?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like if one of you is from one of the same nations as another player you could have a minor or major connection with them, whatever works
Dirty Lego (Tom): Or even a different nation as long as you got a reason üôå
Erik: ~~*what things should I be reading first?*~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): god i wish i knew
Dirty Lego (Tom): The world guide if you haven't but that's the primary thingy
Dirty Lego (Tom): Uhhhh
Erik: ~*makes cat Laguz that's totally not based on Blake*~
Dirty Lego (Tom): So this is Nokri
Dirty Lego (Tom): <@301927856240459777>  accurate representation right
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that is not an accurate representation
Dirty Lego (Tom): Honestly the fanarts channel had some funny ass fanarts if the cast if you wanted to take a scroll
Leanna: ....i have like a fully fleshed out character in my head but i prob cant use it cause idk how character creation works LMAO
Dirty Lego (Tom): You totally can!
Dirty Lego (Tom): Youüëègotüëèthis!
Leanna: <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you can adapt!
Bill: This game system is called Fate. Fate, unlike d&d is not number heavy. Instead it‚Äôs built around aspects, which are phrases that describe the characters key features.
Bill: So if you know your character, Fate is easy.
Bill: http://www.aurii.us/article/2018/12/27/character-sheet-season-2.html
Leanna: oof alright im gonna have to need someone to help walk me through it at some point because what the fuck am i reading
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): every time i read it my mind errors
Leanna: ok at least im not the only one
Leanna: my brain does not work this way
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I just read the tl;dr that bill posts
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~oo wheres that~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The thing in the character channel?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oooo ok yea my mind errored at that too
Leanna: same
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): rip, i just have no drive to re write my shit
Bill: I can't help with that.
Bill: What's erroring, first of all
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~like i just cant focus on it~~
Leanna: i mean for me, i just ... quite literally just have never played anything like this.... so idk where yall are getting these things to fill the chart
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive tried to read it like 3 times now
Leanna: you just..... wing it?
Leanna: what stops you from being god
Bill: Which chart?
Dirty Lego (Tom): You know the thing that says stress with the 3 empty check boxes on that
Leanna: the character build thing
Dirty Lego (Tom): That except 100 check marks
Dirty Lego (Tom): Boom
Leanna: ok so guys, i wanna become as Gods
Bill: Lets start with the easy one. Approaches.
Bill: When you do something that requires dice, you'll do so in one of the 6 ways. Clever, Flashy, Sneaky, Quick, Careful, or Forceful. You assign a number, to each of these traits. Higher means when your character is acting in that manner, you're better at it.
Bill: So, If you have a high forceful, you're really good at starting the intimidation off with a ~~Y~~bang.
Bill: But if you have a high clever, you'll probably want to trick the target into giving you information.
Erik: so similar to ability scores in DnD?
Bill: Pretty much.
NüÜóri (Marisa): YEAH THAT NOKRI GIF
Lots of good talk goin in here yehaw
Erik: üëå
Bill: You assign the following numbers. `3`, `2`, `2`, `1`, `1`, `0`.
Leanna: how do i pick my numbers? i just wing it ? and ya'll just hope im not God?  oh wait nvm i see
Bill: You add a dice roll to these base numbers, so even if you have a 0 in a method, you can still do that method
Leanna: ya answered my question
Leanna: ~~sorry, i warned bill, im gonna ask a LOT of dumb questions~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): Oh I read somewhere that the numbers were all 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 so I have to edit that on my sheet
Erik: ~~oh I will too lol I'm a "do-by-example" learner~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): I asked so many dumb questions pls ask meow
NüÜóri (Marisa): More
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): dont apologize fren
NüÜóri (Marisa): But it autocorrected to meow
NüÜóri (Marisa): Nice
Bill: ~~it means your taking an active interest so please ask as much as you want~~
Bill: Aspects are harder to describe.
Leanna: anyone have screenshots of what the actual gameplay looks like, cause im still confuse
Bill: https://github.com/Willowlark/Dizzy/tree/master/batch-logs these are the logs.
Bill: It's basically just collaborative writing.
Bill: Don't stress it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you be ok
Bill: The rule stuff will mostly be done by me.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah William takes care of the rules
Dirty Lego (Tom): Seriously don't stress it
Bill: http://www.aurii.us/article/2018/12/27/character-sheet-season-2.html So if you scroll down to the aspects section, the last section gives you ideas of what Aspects are.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> your stunt is a bit too general.
Leanna: how many aspects do you get
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> I like that you're thinking about the aspects in terms of invoke/compel, but just to be clear there's no guarantee you'll get those particular results, even for a fate point.
Bill: 3 minimum, up to 5.
Bill: Think aloud if that helps Leanna, I can help you work concepts into aspects.
NüÜóri (Marisa): jumanji done <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
yeah i have no idea what i'm doing so i just tried
Leanna: i mean i have no idea where to even start with that
Bill: Oh no, you did good.
NüÜóri (Marisa): that's why i didn't make it like "100% this *will* happen"
Bill: All your aspects seem to make sense. bootlicker is a core concept for Nokri, it represents how she goes about life. Same for habitual liar. It describes her personality, good and bad. Potion and poison highlights a skill of hers. Animal lover shows a unique feature of her. And her physical traits being a foreigner are shown in yer not from around here.
NüÜóri (Marisa): [nokri drops everything in the middle of an important scene to go pet a lizard]
Bill: that would be a compel I give you.
NüÜóri (Marisa): win/win all around
Bill: Your invoke is a little sideways, an invoke would be a benefit. So you could use it to convince a guard dog to let you by.
Bill: Invokes are basically you arguing "Because of this thing about my character (aspect), I should get to do this". Compels are me saying "Because of this thing about your character (aspect), you should do this". Alternatively compels can be a general thing like, "Because of this thing about your character (aspect), this should happen to you".
NüÜóri (Marisa): i gotta fix the approaches too. that's 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0? something like that?
i might delete the animal one i just put it in to have 5. animals are a blessing and a curse.
Bill: yup, those numbers.
Leanna: how did yall come up with names
Leanna: very important
Dirty Lego (Tom): I stole all of my names from dark souls
Dirty Lego (Tom): no shame
Leanna: .....valid, i respect that
Dirty Lego (Tom): including my sisters name
Dirty Lego (Tom): and my partents
Bill: Asides from Yuria's boyfriend, who I used the dark souls name scheme for, I use random name generators.
NüÜóri (Marisa): lots of random name generators, mashing stuff together, and then googling it to make sure it wasn't an existing word in another language.
nokri is a fake name but i forgot her real name haha oops. it's in a file somewhere.
Dirty Lego (Tom): btw Elfriedes sister is üî•
Dirty Lego (Tom): shes the better version of Elfriede in pretty much everything
NüÜóri (Marisa): afina falls in love with alfredo's sister
Dirty Lego (Tom): valid
Bill: ~~she's also a lego~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tru
Leanna: good to know <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Afina Tyndall was actually my RWBY oc name lmaoooo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Afina means blueberry and Tyndall comes from the Tyndall effect where light in a diluted substance looks blue
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Thanks physics
NüÜóri (Marisa): so she's violet from willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Bill: I can see it.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Now I need to add ‚ÄúAfina you‚Äôre turning violet‚Äù into the story
Dirty Lego (Tom): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/396381171975454730/437116142570569758/IMG_20180421_0001.jpg?width=453&height=677

this is the only concept art of Yuria to exist atm
Bill: ~~she's dating a guy whose basically cat Sun~~
Bill: Looks like him.
Bill: Henceforward Sun.
Bill: ~~get ready to call the Laguz animal races Faunus all the fucking time~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): shes everyones crush in all of Aurii
Leanna: a mood
Leanna: i can tell already
Erik: Oh I'm planning on making a ~~faunus~~ laguz
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): iiii dont even remember where Aldus's name came from
Leanna: ~~same~~
Bill: Didn't want to use the RWBY name cause we're not *that bad* but the fire emblem name doesn't stick.
Dirty Lego (Tom): WOO MOAR FURRIES
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but everytime i see "aldi" or "aldo" im like THATS DA BOI
Bill: Hurray, more furries for Afina!
Dirty Lego (Tom): Afrin is gonna love this
Dirty Lego (Tom): ayyy
Dirty Lego (Tom): Nokri, Afina and thier Furry Harem
NüÜóri (Marisa): hewwo welcome to my qwuest uwu
i honestly forgot about this until midway through katsucon when it suddenly horribly dawned on me i had long forgotten to update it and had an existential crisis
but if there's still interest it can be rebooted

BASICALLY it's a choose your own adventure game set in a semi-apocalyptic early 1900s America where rapid westward expansion and industrialization totally messed up the country and it's being reclaimed by angry nature magic. Our protagonist is a girl named Amelia who is looking for her missing uncle. To find him or get a message out to the uncle somehow, she followed a guy named Judas to the city but Judas done Messed Up‚Ñ¢ while they were travelling and is in the hospital now so she's just exploring the city on her own.
Bill: Where from?
NüÜóri (Marisa): "look at all dis furry......... alldis.... aldus......"
NüÜóri (Marisa): aldi stars in a lot of anime
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea hes famous
Dirty Lego (Tom): :3c
Leanna: ~~i literally just went and ran to my furry son and told him that im making a fursona~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'm always ready for the next episowd of Mawisa qwest uwu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ill pay someone 1 corn ship to rewrite aldi's character sheet
Bill: ~~oh my god is someone going to make a rabbit leggo~~
Leanna: me
Bill: ^
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
IM FUCKING PUMPED
Leanna: and i already wanna make fan art
NüÜóri (Marisa): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Leanna: RIP MY ASS LMAO
Bill: really, rabbit leggo?
Leanna: yes fam
Dirty Lego (Tom): YESSSS
Leanna: i say rabbit and was like "THIS IS IT"
Bill: oh this should be good.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I SUGGESTED THAT AFTER THE GAME OPENED
NüÜóri (Marisa): what corn ship is it because i don't like pairing corn with asura or her brothers
Dirty Lego (Tom): IM SO GLAD I DID
Dirty Lego (Tom): FOR THIS MOMENT
Leanna: SO LIKE
Bill: They're oppressed by the military Tom works for!
Dirty Lego (Tom): YEET
Leanna: IM
Leanna: LMAO
Dirty Lego (Tom): Cant wait to oppress yall!
Leanna: can i just copy paste what i sent jack, even if i cant use what i word vomited to him
Erik: ~~*I want to make a tiger but I don't know where that could connect to anyone else*~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OwO whats this? come racial variety? bless
Dirty Lego (Tom): *only in kenya*
Bill: So Rabbit tidbits. They're native to the south western island. Said island was conquered by the Eraian nation. There's a ~~rabb~~ellion forming on the island to remove the occupying Eraian forces.
Erik: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hPtBnhehPOU/hqdefault.jpg
Bill: Tiger and Cat laguz are the most common on the main land, you could be in a variety of places.
Bill: What else can you tell me about him?
Erik: that's all I got so far
Bill: There are rabbit laguz pirates. Afina and Elfriede were attacked by them once.
Erik: I'm still trying to familiarize myself with the world
Leanna: "so like
rabbit humanoid (basically a faunus is what im picking up from the guide) with bun/ponytail ears to hide ears in hair.

heavy accent..
takes zero shit. WILL kick your ass.

Wears militaristic clothes, has a utility belt and their tail pops out of their pants to look like its part of the belt. (hiding that theyre a furry cause the world is  apparently fucking racist )
has massive thighs and will kill you with them.
 i might wanna make them a boy
not sure yet

with like wildling hair braids and shit

This might just be my fursona, not even sure if i can use him in this rpg"
Bill: It's a lot I know.
Leanna: i made a fursona
Leanna: so like
Leanna: guess im a furry now
Dirty Lego (Tom): WOOO
Dirty Lego (Tom): Congrats!
NüÜóri (Marisa): c o n f i r m e d
NüÜóri (Marisa): also we're making a dating game of all the characters
Bill: All that would work. Laguz traits are just ears and tail.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the worlds not super racist btw
Dirty Lego (Tom): laguzs are Faunus
Dirty Lego (Tom): *dab*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): unless biru i turning that up
Bill: Yeah, not super racist.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I stg i didnt make Elfriedes last name Faun for that reason
Bill: Depends on the nation.
Dirty Lego (Tom): ...
Erik: is it faunus rules where it's either or?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like i played full on furry wolf boi and got no racism EXCEPT NOKRI
Bill: Nope, both.
Erik: oh neat
Bill: ~~Their inspired by fire emblem laguz, we just called them faunus cause we're trash~~
Leanna: oh ok, lit
Leanna: less racist than originally planned
Leanna: good
Bill: You guys saw Laguz transform into their animal forms right?
Leanna: ive never played fire emblem
Leanna: rip
Dirty Lego (Tom): oh in case yall didnt know this world was adapted from Fire emblem
Bill: ~~though rabbits transform into a weird not rabbit shape~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/b/bf/Panne_%28FE13_Artwork%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20180220024856
Dirty Lego (Tom): BUNNY LUGZ
Dirty Lego (Tom): exist in fire emblem
Leanna: ohhhhhhhhhhh
Leanna: ok gotcha
NüÜóri (Marisa): 
Dirty Lego (Tom): https://i.redd.it/xw2t5k32wyb11.jpg
Bill: Yeah those.
Bill: Ignore the human form but yeah, weird rabbit form.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): panne and yarne are my bbys
Leanna: ok thats adorable,~~a little scary~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): yarne is precious
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): precious bby boi
Bill: Cats, Wolves, and Tigers transform normally.
Dirty Lego (Tom): https://pm1.narvii.com/6502/48c0e595f4f1d67703de197dea9060ed8f6c350f_hq.jpg
NüÜóri (Marisa): he stretch
Dirty Lego (Tom): lmao
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:BOI:549661126141411351>
Dirty Lego (Tom): sorry for the fire emblem pictures, dont wanna confuse
NüÜóri (Marisa): ~~nokri talkin trash about rabbits~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): Laguz human forms dont look like that
Leanna: do they... have fur
Dirty Lego (Tom): its closer to Faunus
Bill: no fur.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what a mood
Leanna: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Erik: I feel like drawing and designing my character first will help me flesh him out
Erik: or
Erik: *fur* him out
Dirty Lego (Tom): charcters also change a bit as you play naturally
Dirty Lego (Tom): not gonna lie when i wrote my character he was such a brat
Dirty Lego (Tom): he didnt really end up that way
Bill: Wynne isn't racist at all, they've basically integrated the wolf laguz culture into theirs.
Callora is ~~bullshit~~ made up of individual city states, so it varies.
Eraia low key considers them a lesser race, but they aren't outright racist. Eraia's got all sorts of social issues on top of that by being a church controlled kingdom that's very crusade happy.
Theanovene is a melting pot, laguz racism is on a individual level.
Dreca has few laguz on it's mainland and it just invaded the Kissaelain (Cat and Tiger) Territories. So they're most racist. ~~Especially since they enslaved the occupied cities~~
Leanna: semi racist
Bill: Entirely depends on the country.
Bill: Erik you can easily find Tiger laguz in Theanovene, Eraia (the southern controlled sections usually) or Callora.
Bill: You guys saw the map?
Leanna: theres a map?
Bill: http://www.aurii.us/article/2017/09/01/aurii-map.html
Dirty Lego (Tom): it would be really ironic for Elfriede to go to like... Wynne and get hated on by a local laguz tribe for being human
NüÜóri (Marisa): it's our server logo!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wow i have no idea who i want Aldus to be anymore
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): rip
Bill: The colored sections represent what country controls the territory.
Bill: White sections don't have a strong enough presence from any nation to be called owned by that nation.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> where's your fancy map?
Bill: OH
Bill: You may want to know there are Drecian Wyvern knights and Wynne Pegasus knights.
Bill: As options.
Dirty Lego (Tom): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/396381171975454730/421469975216259082/So_how_was_the_pull_out.jpg

going through fanarts is the best
Bill: Also, you are fully able to make yourself a noble, experienced, any kind of skill level. You don't have to be a default level 1 adventurer.
Bill: And if you want to design a country in Callora you can.
Leanna: LMAO AT THAT ARt
Bill: RIP Atalantia.
Leanna: soooooo what kinda outfits do they wear, typica fantasy shit?
Leanna: ~~my priorities are in line obviously~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah pm
Dirty Lego (Tom): depending on region
Dirty Lego (Tom): ~~pm what you want~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): just try to make it fit the region or characterization

Leanna: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of info to digest right now, so im like high key just focusing in on what hes gonna look like
Leanna: xD

Dirty Lego (Tom): WAEERGEGaerthaeth
Leanna: LMAO OH MY GOD
Dirty Lego (Tom): IM SO GLAD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG
Dirty Lego (Tom): Check out Elfreides fine butt
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~tom made sure that was defined~~
Leanna: very nice
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~like took the pen out of my hand and "fixed" it~~
Leanna: LMAOOOOOOOO
Dirty Lego (Tom): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/396381171975454730/396390132695171072/Squad_1.jpg
Dirty Lego (Tom): ah that was the first art
Dirty Lego (Tom): Jess's doing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): two of these character are gone rip
Dirty Lego (Tom): Rip Atalantia, Rip Eliran
Bill: ~~No tears shed for Eliran~~
Bill: http://www.aurii.us/aurii_library/aurii-map.html new link to the map, it's now in the Library tab.
Bill: Also yeah, outfit design follows rule of cool.
Leanna: im like nervous about actually playing because im bad at dialog... but i sure as hell am hype to do fanart
Erik: so with RWBY logic, lots of useless buckles and straps and floating armor
Erik: got it
Dirty Lego (Tom): correct!
Dirty Lego (Tom): and dont worry, theres no bad way to play
Dirty Lego (Tom): unless you start just stabbing all the other cast members
Dirty Lego (Tom): that may be bad
Leanna: https://tenor.com/view/ok-okay-gif-5850917
Leanna: xD
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): even nokri is a gremlin and somehow she works
Dirty Lego (Tom): Billiam will create the overarching plot
Bill: ~~sort of works~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): wow afinas sure gonna love all these LEGOS
Dirty Lego (Tom): guess we should switch our names back soon huh.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _no you‚Äôre perfect as is_
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :3
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I CANT WAIT THISLL BE FUN
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Stunts is really trippin me up
Bill: you just need a less general example.
Bill: So it shows up in *certain* instances but not like, everything you do.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): well i thought it meant id only get the bonus once
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): afina feels flat, all she has is her knowledge and racism and dokis
Bill: The +2 version is any time the approach is used in that scenario.
Bill: The once per arc is a more powerful ability you can only use... per arc, which is a kinda fuzzy term. Probably in game day.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im tryna think that probably cause afinas magic is affected by her self confidence, maybe she can feel inspired by friends once per arc to be able to cast confidently?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): THE POWER OF NAKAMA
Bill: Sounds like her aspect. Think a little more unique. Some kind of extra powerful spell?
Bill: or a social skill, like getting papers or access to money, things like that.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): "the princess card" lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): should the friends be the +2 stat then?
Bill: pretty much though.
Bill: that overlaps with your Am the light aspect. You'd be able to say "Because of my friends support right now, I'll spend a fate point and get a +2 on this spell". The stunt would do basically the same thing.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): are you saying theyd mash up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like bonus from aspect AND stunt
Bill: They'd 'stack' and I'd rather you spread the bonuses.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hmm
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): can i pull the racist card and get a +2 when acting cleverly against laguz LOL
Bill: That would actually work. Though, it also overlaps with your laguz aspect.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): afina is too flat for this shit lol
Bill: You want to make her less flat? Add a new aspect of her personality.
Bill: I think of that, when I make characters, as what do they do when they don't have work or a mission to do.
Bill: What are her hobbies and personal interests.
Bill: She isn't JUST a magic and policy spewing princess.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah shes also racist ;P
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): time to look up a list of hobbies
Bill: ~~that's not one to lean into~~
Bill: Also relevant are causes or passions. Maybe she wants to feed the poor. Save the whales.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): beekeeping is suggested lmaooo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _starting a youtube channel_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): could i do something with her skills being a noble person?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like horseback riding?
Bill: yup, but that does touch on the princess angle.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): im trying to think of hobbies that are even available to her
Bill: Maybe it's the ones that aren't.
Bill: Give her an aspect about the thing she's always wanted to do, free herself from princess responibilies and X. Then move magic to the stunt bonus.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): F U C K
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): jk lmao
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): what hobbies do people have in the limited time period they live in
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): theres no internet
Bill: Also possibilities think about what makes her happy, or what catches her interest.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so remove the noble and laeran aspect entirely
Aldus Larian (Jess): I will attempt to revamp Aldus tomorrow.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Aldus 2.0
Erik: I plan on doing a lot of this tomorrow... at work...
NüÜóri (Marisa): bigger

Aldus Larian (Jess): Stronk
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe ill give hima  wood working hobby
Bill: SAME
Bill: S'long as I'm not in a meeting I'm available.
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe ill completely destroy him!
Aldus Larian (Jess): well see
Bill: My advice for aspects and such is to brainstorm together with the rest of the group.
Erik: boys love to work with their wood <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~Alright, Ray!Aldus~~
Bill: It makes it easier.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _can afinas hobby be hunting_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oof no i get gaston vibes
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo aldus hunts
Bill: Cept Gastion doesn't read.
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was like his job or whatever
Bill: It could be an area of research she does on her own time.

Aldus Larian (Jess): fuck it aldus is shop keeper now
Aldus Larian (Jess): "yoohoo, big summa blowout!"

Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant remeber
NüÜóri (Marisa): nokri gets aldus to do drugs for kicks because "it'll help restore your powers and stuff"
Aldus Larian (Jess): he chews mint leaves so he has  fresh breath in his feeble attempt to woo women
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): <@!184437198865563648> can i give her like, a quick learner trait?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): good guy aldus
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think he tried some drugs cuz hes desperate but when they didnt work he was like fuck this
Bill: As a once per arc she could speed read content of some kind, that sounds fine.
Bill: I liked the idea where Aldus because a roguish criminal who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.
Aldus Larian (Jess): also we got a big gender imbalance here its lookin like
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~but that also involes his father killing his mother in a rage~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): pauses in the middle of battle to speedread fanfic
Bill: Yeah I noticed, gender imbalance ~~weakens shipping~~ is okay tho.
Bill: ~~all four male characters start hitting on Yuria~~
Bill: *Yes Elfriede too*

Aldus Larian (Jess): In certain circumstances maybe Aldi and Nokri could get together buuuut she mean to him
Bill: ~~Aurii High School Host CLub~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): EXCUSE
Bill: *It's an insult to Nokri not Aldus*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aldus is totally shipable
NüÜóri (Marisa): *excuse*
Bill: I meant shippable *girl*.
NüÜóri (Marisa): nokri is ~~horrible~~ an angel but she could change for aldus maybe
Aldus Larian (Jess): üëÄ
NüÜóri (Marisa): but does aldus really not have any other bachelorettes <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): he has an ex!
Bill: We shall see... Nokri is kinda a gremlin to the core.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and there just arnt any other women
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): elfies kinda anal too not gonna lie
NüÜóri (Marisa): naw nokri has good parts. she originally wasn't this awful, she just doesn't have many parts to shine
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he only works with afrin cause they CLICHE
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~and im a loser so romance is an important aspect for keeping my attention~~
Bill: People can change in relationships.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): me as fuck

Bill: So it's Nokri and Afrin.
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe i should switch aldus to female?
Aldus Larian (Jess): but idk
Bill: You could.
Bill: More options.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but id have to like retcon him
NüÜóri (Marisa): that will really help him bond with nokri

Bill: But I need to go to bed, so more conversing in the morning.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): romance is fun
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _makes afrin a boi and ruins the game_
Bill: ~~it‚Äôs a fun thing yes~~
Bill: See if Allison wants to bring Atalantia back in.
NüÜóri (Marisa): there was a chibi about that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oh yes
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i remember
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~yea honestly it was pretty high on my list of things i wanted out of the game~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hal said "afina was packing heat"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i remember that specifically
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think atlantia is coming back
Bill: She chose to stay in the server. Hell, I think she did most of the surveys.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~my poor aldus/nokri shipping heart is hurt~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): well i never talked to her so im not just gon be like "hey come be my gf"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _hey lil mama lemme whisper in ya ear_
Bill: WHAT A MOOD
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oooo time to continue my afina playlist
Bill: ~~Ngl I gave up on Nokri ships cause Nokri is just not. Nice.~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~time to retcon?~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): ~~nokri needs a sugar daddy~~
Bill: I know you‚Äôre playing to character Marisa but Nokri is just. Not a team player.
NüÜóri (Marisa): ye
Bill: She‚Äôs tough to work with in a collaborative game.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i feel like they might have had a tiny something starting?
Aldus Larian (Jess): but idk
NüÜóri (Marisa): yeah. again, she wasn't originally supposed to be that way. there's a lot that can serve as incentive for her
NüÜóri (Marisa): yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): forget elfie, its aldus and afina hatefuck time bby
Bill: <@!350847001937707022> if you were considering rejoining is at some point, now would be prime time for it.
Bill: ~~why would anyone care enough to be nice and find the good Nokri if the forward facing Nokri is terrible~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): i can change her if it's a major problem but she isn't supposed to be impossible mode to work with. like she works well with afina. i think people kept calling her out on lies but that's her character? and it kept escalating to fights. it been a long time i'll have to go back and see what all is wrong
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i mean i dont want anyone to change their character for me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~Nokri and Aldus hatefuck~~
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): <@!184437198865563648> i might be able to start back up soon, trying to finalize a lot of stuff lately so im booked solid till end of march
Bill: That‚Äôs what it‚Äôd have to be tho.
NüÜóri (Marisa): are we doing homestuck shipping now
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i dotn know what that means~~
Bill: We‚Äôve been hiatus for awhile, but we‚Äôve started looking into reboot. Keep it in mind.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): in homestuck theres soulmates but for hating each other
Aldus Larian (Jess): it depends on what the story is this time around too
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh right you said that before
NüÜóri (Marisa): nokri can genuinely change. she just had no role to play. there was the part where she was kidnapped to change her and that did alter her personality towards the rest of table-1 but then desii kind of took over any usefulness nokri could provide
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): nokri murdered desii confirmed?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i could see why you felt that way
Bill: Nokri is just. The true form of tsundere. Too mean to even see the dere.
NüÜóri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): well, lets just see what happens
Bill: You‚Äôd need god mode patience (or to be an anime protagonist) to ship with her.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lucky charms cereal?
NüÜóri (Marisa): leprechaun shipping
NüÜóri (Marisa): wait yeah what happened to desii she's still there right?
Bill: She‚Äôs gone.
NüÜóri (Marisa): WHAT
Bill: Left during timeskip.
NüÜóri (Marisa): WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think she went home cuz her quest was complete
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeet
NüÜóri (Marisa): ~~we were planning to accidentally murder her though~~
Bill: Sure whatever we want to say she did.
NüÜóri (Marisa): retired to be a peaceful cow rancher
NüÜóri (Marisa): <:water_flower:412308257378533376>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nokri did get jelly over aldus hangin out with desi
NüÜóri (Marisa): "who'm'st am i supposed to poison now"
Bill: ~~because she lost the money she was going to make on curing him~~
Bill: If you want better interactions with little change, consider giving Nokri a new motivation. To own a ranch, revenge on Dreca, fill out a passport, whatever it is. Money doesn‚Äôt connect you to others, nor does it become a common goal.
NüÜóri (Marisa): all of nokri's stuff was made to be double-sided. not wholly good nor wholly bad, and very open. it's not just money she's after. it could be a good reputation or a good word in with someone. that's why she's helping aldus - obviously not a lot of people have his issue so it wouldn't be profitable to cure, but she'd sure make a name for herself inventing a cool new medicine. she's like a kid where if someone waved a dollar and said "can you do this task?" she'd jump on it for the dollar. 
with her backstory i can't really think of other motivation without changing her whole character, other than like getting a dragon or something.
Bill: (To be clear, you are playing Nokri REALLY WELL. That‚Äôs what makes her so hard to play with.)
NüÜóri (Marisa): but the dollar can also be "i'll tell my friends you're cool" or somethin
NüÜóri (Marisa): ~~i'm sorry she's hard to work with üò≠ i'm tryna make her looser and easier to play with~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you can also consider any development that shes had in the timeskip too
Bill: She‚Äôs always about her. That‚Äôs a bit of it.
NüÜóri (Marisa): post-near-death she'd also keep an eye out for aldus now
Bill: I actually need to sleep fuck. Can talk more tomorrow.
NüÜóri (Marisa): and afina she would perish for afina
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): afina: then perish
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): jkjk
NüÜóri (Marisa): anyone with money or power
NüÜóri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
NüÜóri (Marisa): nokri: dies
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i think that bugged me too like aldus literally saved her life, but then afina just has money ans she was like "oh i love you"
NüÜóri (Marisa): the key to cooperation is literally "hey nokri it'd be super cool and we'd sing your praises if you did this for us"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): aldus and nokri can kiss and make up at the festival of light <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~then you can contribute to the smut pool as well~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~whats that~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): technically
NüÜóri (Marisa): nothing it doesn't exist
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wrote the first smut
NüÜóri (Marisa): no pools here
Aldus Larian (Jess): its in my character boi
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): TRU
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): is that why you yelled at tom to write in the boner
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im gonna retire from aurii and just write smut
NüÜóri (Marisa): <:woah:543194447345876998> üò≠
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
NüÜóri (Marisa): i feel like nokri is really similar to maomao from that manga i've been talking about but i think i started the manga after making nokri
NüÜóri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): well just see where things go, i dont wanna push anyone
NüÜóri (Marisa): i can change i promise i can be a better person don't dump ~~me~~ nokri
Aldus Larian (Jess): id never dump you! ~~maybe nokri~~

Elfriede Faun (Tom): dont forget yall can just create back story characters too :3
Elfriede Faun (Tom): you can even be already twice divorced!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): when did Afina become Yona with all these beatiful doods
Bill: So for the old guard, you know how I‚Äôd occasionally go into theory craft on how to build characters and stories? Would it be helpful to put that into its owns channel rather than here?
Bill: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/table-top-babble/id1187771163?mt=2&i=1000430086046 this is a relevant podcast.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think you fine
Erik: ```Theanovene is neutral to every other kingdom in the world.```
Erik: Wow, my kind of city
Aldus Larian (Jess): Our characters are allowed to use more than one type of weapon right?
Erik: Trying to decide hairstyle for my character. I couldn't unsee Thundercats with the style from last night. So I tried doing an undercut but then it turned into Scarlet David and Sienna Khan's love child
Aldus Larian (Jess): hawt
Erik: 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hawt
Erik: and yes, I gave him cargo pants
Bill: ~~is that what scarlet has been up to?~~
Erik: ~~doubt it because he's a gay~~
Bill: Scarlet?
Erik: ye it was confirmed he doesn't like ladies in the manga
Erik: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdmU_2wVQAAxxpT.jpg
Erik: ~~I need Gavin to read this line because I can't hear him saying it. It sound more like Aoyama's English VA~~
Bill: Huh. didn't know that.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): Our characters are allowed to use more than one type of weapon right?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just not at the same time
Bill: Oh yes, sorry I missed responding to that.
Bill: Getting to work has been a fucking trip.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you mean Aldus cant use a bow and sword at the same time? shit
NüÜóri (Marisa): Not with that attitude he can‚Äôt
NüÜóri (Marisa): Fire a sword using the bow
Erik: was going to say that lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): imma do it
Bill: ~~this isn't Fate Stay Night~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): WE USIN FATE AREN'T WE?
Bill: TOTALLY different but also GOOD point.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~its not related?~~
Bill: Not at all lol.
Bill: Fate Stay Night is an anime.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea but there wqas a game right?
Bill: Visual Novel yes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH i thought it was like a game game
NüÜóri (Marisa): The mobile game!
Bill: It's gotten games, but the original was the VN.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I thought it was related to babe it's okay
Bill: Which brings up
Aldus Larian (Jess): wheres the 40 iteration of saber?
Bill: pissh, they only have *20*.
Bill: Two things from my morning podcasts. Characters are able to have a character arc when they change in the course of the story. So, assuming you want a character who evolves with time, it may help to think about what part of them will change as they adventure, unconsciously or consciously.

Food for thought. Has Nokri crossed anyone's moral event horizon? IE, has she done something unforgivable to that character? Has anyone else crossed someones?
Bill: Simple example of the prior, Yang goes from 'I punch shit' to thinking during a fight. Those kinds of evolutions are üëå
Bill: I realize it might help you to consider this a story Leanna. It's a story with multiple authors and main characters, and there's a random element involved via dice and rules, but effectively it's a story of these characters. Literary (as well as improv and theater) terms can often be used.
Leanna: Ye that's what I picked up from the scripts
NüÜóri (Marisa): Nokri‚Äôs done some atrocities in the army and scammed a lot of people
An angel
Bill: Me: not running any games currently
Me: failed to setup any in person games in the last two years post college
My Friends: people interested in straight D&D
Also Me: *Let's kickstart this indie ruleset I'll never play*
Bill: Should I bring back the office hour thing?
NüÜóri (Marisa): pwofesow biru
NüÜóri (Marisa): might be better if we just bother you whenever and you respond whenever?
Bill: I when I drive home is just best time to get me on voice specifically.
NüÜóri (Marisa): ooooo tru
