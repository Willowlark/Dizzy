Aspects:

Tactical Thinker: Has been in many arena battles with his brother so he will size up opponents and use what is the best strategy for the group.  Can sometimes treat real battles like arena battles and not think of the consequenses.

Moves like a cat: Tikur learned the ins and outs of his wolf form with his cat foster parents. He moves and fights more like a cat than a wolf, light on his feet and graceful. Sometimes his larger form keeps him from moving the way he needs to though.

Balanced Fighter: Has used magic and swordsmanship in many battles and is very comfortable and quick to switch between his magical tome and the sword. He's just sometimes not quick enough..."you wanna know how i got these scars?"

Showman: Due to galavanting around with his brother to different arena battles Tikur has picked up some crowd wooing techniques; he'll put on a show if the mood is right..or if you get a little liquor in him.

Others Come First: If there are people in need of aid Tikur will help them without a second thought.  With his family gone all he has left to do is help others..

Stunt: 

Electric Boogaloo: Because I honed my magic for combat, I can eat a focused lightning pill and get a +2 to magic damage. (Tikur will only use it when he is sure to win a fight, because it will make him tired and lethargic after it wears off.)
