Aspects:
1. **Lyall is(n't) a priority** Elfriede (and most of his family) does what he can to keep up appearances, and has even convinced himself otherwise, but his loyalty to Lyall doesn’t run all that deep.
2. **Knight’s Code** Will stick to the basic chivalrous knight code… mostly.
3. **Avoid that eye contact** Will get really embarrassed when he fails.
4. **Hide the truth.** Elfriede will try his best to hide his tail from everyone
5. **My parents are lawyers.** A bit sassy, especially to those he deems lower than him.

Approaches:
Careful: 0
Clever: +3
Flashy: +3
Forceful: +1
Quick: +2
Sneaky: +1

Stunts: 


**Knight duelist training** Because of his obsessive training (especially under house arrest), gets a +2 quickness whenever dueling someone 1 on 1 while he has both his dagger and his rapier (no other distractions).

**Knight Light** Despite everything.., once per arc due to his traveling and time spent with Afina, he can nod to her where she can see him and she'll know almost exactly what he is thinking.

**Inquisitor's gaze** Elfriede really looks up to his sister. Because of such, whenever she is observing him doing something, he gets a -2 to careful but a +2 to flashy.
