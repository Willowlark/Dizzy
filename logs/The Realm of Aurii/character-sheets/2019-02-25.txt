**Aspects**
BOOTLICKER
Nokri will stubbornly suck up to anyone in a position of wealth or high authority. She will wheedle her way into where she doesn't belong for her own personal gain. 
When invoked, Nokri will become a trusted ally of the superior group and have access to limited resources and information.
When compelled, Nokri will abandon her teammates to take the side of whoever she's brown-nosing.
HABITUAL LIAR
Nokri has a habit of lying to cover her trail, from minor omissions to painting an entirely new identity for herself.
When invoked, nearly everyone can fall for one of Nokri's elaborate tall tales.
When compelled, Nokri can't help lying about something minor that backfires and domino effects into big trouble.
POTION AND POISON ARE BASICALLY THE SAME
Nokri has an extensive healing knowledge thanks to her upbringing. She has experience in physical surgeries, healing magic, potions, and salves. She doesn't much care for it, however, and tends to get sloppy in her healing practice unless she's highly focused.
When invoked, Nokri can heal an injury or sickness, or create a very potent poison.
When compelled, Nokri will do... something. 50% chance it helps in some way, 50% chance it hurts.
ANIMAL LOVER
Nokri prefers animals to humans, especially reptiles. She has a soft spot for anything that can't talk or comprehend human language.
When invoked, Nokri will wander off in search of an animal to clear her head.
When compelled, Nokri will ignore the people in her surroundings to focus on an animal.
YER NOT FROM AROUND HERE
In certain areas, Nokri sticks out as a clear ~~outsider~~ tourist.
When invoked, Nokri can make use of this and get people to show her around town or offer her aid.
When compelled, Nokri winds up running from an angry mob in one form or another.
