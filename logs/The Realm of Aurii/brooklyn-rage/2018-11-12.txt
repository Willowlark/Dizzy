To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): poor hunter
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): you could see all over his face today that he really doesnt want casey to leave
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he was trying to make jokes like "haha what would i do without casey" but if you pay attention its obvious that it really hurts him to see her go
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): yeah
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): well of course
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo ya
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and he got all serious as they were leaving like "ill bring casey by rutgers this week so you can say goodbye and still study while everyones at ANYC"
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): yeah...
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): it really blows
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): *love hurts plays menacingly in the background*
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): when she leaving
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): the sunday of ANYC!
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): it got bumped up so soon!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh wow 😮
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): ooof..
Bill: He should tell her.
Bill: I say, currently dying inside. But, he’ll never get closure and be able to move on if he doesn’t.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): maybe even HE hasnt realized it
Bill: He’s going to be miserable either way. May as well do it right.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like,,, this doki in my kokoro,,,,,, what is it
Bill: The urge to not be a home wrecker is pretty strong in most people.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): SCREAMS ALL THE THINGS GOING ON IN _HALS_ LIFE WHAT BULLSHIT
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ahem anyways
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yeah
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he was a sad boi
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he had melancholic eyes all weekend
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and him and casey are in such sync hes like "i forgot my meds" and she was like "nope i got it!" and she was like i forgot my phone and he was like "nope i have it"
Bill: Yes, believe it or not Hal’s moved on too.
Bill: Good friends doesn’t mean romance... but he may as well try. Idk, we’re biased because we dislike Ethan, but...
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): im just saying hes dealt with his grandma in the hospital and he dumped someone, and chooses not to go to class which is why his grades are skipping
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): my other grandpa was just given less than a week to live the other day and you dont see me moaning .-.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): hunter would be better than ethan lets be real
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ethan pushed this whole move thing onto casey cause he didnt wanna choose between texas and her
Bill: He would be. But it’s still wrong to ask out a girl in a relationship. As much as I feel he should... it is wrong.
Bill: It’s disrespectful to her preferences.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he doesnt have to ask her out per se
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he could just be like "this is how i feel, i just want you to know"
Bill: Yeah, no, you don’t just sit on a confession.
Bill: Just saying it doesn’t help matters. If anything it gives you hope they may return them.
Bill: It’s the answer back that gives closure.
Bill: Casey will feel pressure to give him a response, or avoid him so she doesn’t have to.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): considering casey, shes the avoiding type
Bill: And she has a perfect way to do it.
Bill: Fuck love am I right.
Bill: Poor guy is damned anyway you slice it.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): sobs into a lean cuisine why is life so hard
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): why cant hunter be a gorgeous millionaire that whisks her away
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): also like
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): crossing ethan is
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): hmm
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): :///
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): That’s the guy who had the prop printing company he closed right
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yuuuup
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he an anger boi
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he texted me saying that we could be friends again now that hal was gone
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OH YEAH AND HE USED YOU FOR PERSONAL GAIN
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I’m gonna beat him up
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): what does Greg have to go with anything
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): ethan didnt like hal
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): for undisclosed reasons
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he says hal is a know it all
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and is too immature
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): 🤔
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): **hmm**
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): tho my dad, not knowing that ethan made that judgement, said the same two things last week
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): **h m m **
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): **I M F E E L I N G I T**
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ethan and i are cordial but i recognize that casey is adamant about him being a big part of her life
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ~~are you feeling it now mr krabs~~
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): **IAM**
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): So she’s moving across the country for him?
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): but yeah.. idk whats gonna happen after Casey nyooms.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Is Casey the small one or do I not know her
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): all casey friends are here :((((
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): im imagining hunter video calling her
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): casey is pretty smal
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): and ethan being all wierd about it
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): No the small is reiley I can’t spell the name. The ruby you had last night. Right?
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): a big problem is i think ethan is gonna try and keep her from everyone
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): 
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): that casey
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): we been friends like three almost 4 years
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OH that Casey! Thank I don’t think I’ve met her then
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ruby from last night is reiley lol yes
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): she tiny and nice
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): they*
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): but ye, v small, 4'11
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Oops sorry thanks for correcting
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): i was the tallest there among the 4 of us
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): casey is 5'2 and leanna is 5'3
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): but yeah even ethan admits like he doesnt have friends there either
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Reign among them and assert your tall authority
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he had no halloween plans cause he didnt know anyone so he just sat there alone
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): i was like "you wanna hit up people from the con circuit?"
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Is he already in Texas?
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and he was just like "nah i just dont know anyone"
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ye he prepped the house
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like if it were me id be like "HELLO FRIENDS I AM HERE, LET US HANG"
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): but he arrived in texas with the same mentality and............... no friends
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): That’s when you go out to a public Halloween event at like a skating rink or something and meet people
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Or go trick or treating to introduce yourself to your neighbors (don’t get candy because adult but it’s an easy way to meet everyone)
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Reverse trick or treat
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Give THEM candy
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yeah and honestly??? i could move to texas right now and easily have like 3 friends
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): maybe thats cause im a nice person not like hIM
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): but still
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): we made a ton of texan acquaintances by going to RTX twice
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): How long has he been there?
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and he hasnt hit ANY of those people up
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): a couple months
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like 2 or 3 i think
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Oof yeah that’s plenty of time
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Not even any coworkers or anything to spend time with? Yikes.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I never spend time with people ever but even I knew a few people in Japan before moving here and was able to make friends through school/work once those started
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yeah! no friends through work
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he bought her a kitty tho
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): named pandora
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): 😻
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): she smol and black
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I’d move to Texas for a cat
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): well the cat was a gift separate from texas
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the gift of Texas
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yo why the chats always get lit like .2 second after I'm not around 😂
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): You gotta stay *forever*
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): i mean is ethan drama anything good at this point
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yo Ethan is red flag city, how many times did he call Casey this weekend? Cuz I've noticed he always seems to call whenever I've been around her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): And I always hear he answering the question "who's there?"
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): omg
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yeah
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he did actually
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like at least 3 times
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ive never had a significant other call me that many times just for no reason
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and he never seemed to call with a particular reason?
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): hes prob a little possessive and a little lonely
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea he's def possessive. Prob loney too but it's his own fault
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Does he call multiple times an hour
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't think so
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Ok it can still get worse in time.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): hal is pissing me off so bad in this nsfw chat but if i drop out of the conversation im conceding to being angry
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): theres a lot of things that i feel like hes taking a dig at me for
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): yeah i noticed
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): im gonna punch this kid in the MOUTH
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): im surprised eric idnt wake the fucc up to bitch slap him about his tiny dick compensation comment
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Yeah he’s acting like what the conversation is about
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): the tiny mouth and big peen comment was definitely an @ me
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and he was like "i have testimony" like fuk YOU BITCH
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): im seething omg
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): What’s something he hates I can try to change the convo
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): hes also just dragging on the same topics too much like
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ~~ask if hes been going to class lately~~
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): alright it was funny time to move on
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): "dont you have a starbucks shift to sleep for"
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): oh man i was like maybe hes pushing my buttons with the first few comments but the small mouth one
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): OH I KNEW
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): that ho
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): im love u marisa
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): And yet he’s still typing something I may have failed
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): omg that messAGE
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): IM GONA FUCKIN MURDER HIM
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I’ll help clean the blood
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): HE WAS DIRECTLY TRYING TO @ ME
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he said i would be annoying when he said no to sex
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): so i only saw him every 2 weeks and we still wouldnt always get to do anything
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and frankly it made me feel unloved
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): cause all these rutgers randos thought i was hot but he never wanted to like?? do it?
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and its an intimacy thing
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): OOF IM SO ANGER
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): openly discussing sexual experiences,in a discord, with your Ex in it, is very rude
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Yeah seriously. And he posted that lewd text message. He seems a bit socially oblivious
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like i couldve been like "haha yeah now i have a partner that actually concerns himself with me feeling wanted, ive never had that before!"
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): but like i DIDNT
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): _i couldve_
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and meanwhile hes throwing underhanded insults at me
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Georgia the better person 👌
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): my knee jerk reaction wants to message him and be like "thats very immature of you" but i know better than to do so
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): yeah that wont get you anywhere
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): hell just deny everything
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Yeah he’d just use it against you and complain about “crazy ex”
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like "whaaat noooo those were just general comments :)))"
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): yeah that
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): at least he has to hide his relationship with meg to BNE cause he knows everyone would judge him
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): he's gotten notciably more toxic lately, i dont even wanna see him at NYC
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Is that why there’s been no mention of it anywhere? Good that restores my faith. I thought people in BNE knew and were ok with it
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): nah i dont even think were supposed to know
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760> but we do
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): well casey know
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and ethan knew cause couples know everything
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and ethan likes to shit talk hal so who better to do so than hals ex
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ethan also thought casey already told me
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and then i told everyone :))))
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): ❤
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): YE now almost all fo BNE knows so its this elephant in the room with more of them
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): everyone at halloween knows SOOOOO yeah
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): so i guess hal talking is just him making more of an ass of himself
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like everyone picked up on the fact that meg didnt start being active in the discord until hal
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): HMMMM SUSPICIOUS
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): ye, like im sure a few dont mind but
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): ok i aint sleepin yet but DAMN what a ho

To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): sometimes i worry i AM crazy-ex-girlfriend-ing
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): but moments like these i realize im valid
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Noooo not at all. Yeah he’s totally the crazy ex in this situation
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): yeah, you are taking everything very well tbh
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): and you are making smart decisions
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): he cant turn anything around on you
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): because you've done nothing wrong
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): but you know hed try if you did
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): and thats no good

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Is she still Like That™
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): she issss
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): everything is so much better now that shes been gone tho
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like noahs come to just chill, and he talks to kiera (my other suitemate) about music and stuff
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): which, im glad for, he doesnt have many friends cause hes shy
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Yaaaay! Do the other roommates feel the same way?
O that’s awesome
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): If he talks with your roommates that mean they chill with people coming over
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Sweet
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): they feel bad but agree her minimizing time in the room is probably for the best
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yeah! and kiera is thinking about joining noahs band now too
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I can understand that. They were all friends ya?
WOO BAND
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and i hang with them during practice, they sound really good
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yee they were
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): do they make original songs or covers
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): original!
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): theyre learning covers to play for geekweek tho
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): geek week paid a band 1K last year to play so im gonna propose we split the funds by having an opening band
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): geek week had a budge of 25K last year <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): WOAH that’s a lot of money
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): The professor I had over the weekend told us to follow him on Twitter and there he was complaining about being paid a lump sum and reimbursed for airfare all in cash lol
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): “Thanks for coming here’s 50,000 yen in cash”
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): o wow
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): he a rich man
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): so how are you marisa? is japan still good?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Ya! It’s not bad, I’ve got a ton of school work and stuff so I can’t go out and do much, but I’ve got the Yona play next weekend~
Buildings keep blasting either the air or the heat so everything is either super hot or super cold
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): My train stop is coming up in a bit so go get some rest if ya need it owo
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Jump to PM so we can gossip about the bois ;3c
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Brushes teeth
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Gets in bed
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Jess wakes up
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Asks, I explain
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Now Jess is mad too 👌
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I AM AWAKE, I've been summoned to pay witness to this BS.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm being given the highlights
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Play by play
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I just found a super cute store with Japanese aprons if anyone wants to be max anime in the kitchen. They’re $7
Bill: I don’t see anything in nsfw... did someone go and delete all the things or...
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): dream memes
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): that's where the horror began
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's aaaaalll still there
Bill: Ah.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Yeah that’s what you’ll scream when you read it
Bill: I never understood what you saw in him, and all the more so now that he’s acting like a fool on top of being stupid.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Managed to ask the house manager to check out the hot water. He’ll come on Wednesday. I’ve tried manually heating up water but it just cools off too fast. Freezing baths suck. 

There are two public baths in walking distance but one is closed by the time I finish school (it’s more a spa place so it’s expensive) and the other doesn’t like foreigners according to google reviews, plus it’s closed on Tuesdays.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Being a minority sucks <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I love walking around sensouji but walking through today I heard no less than four shocked exclamations of “wow there’s a lot of foreigners here”
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Classmates were talking about racism in japan the other day and our Japanese classmates were like “no way that doesn’t happen” and everyone else was like <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if anyone knows any entitled racist people send them to live outside of tokyo
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): or actually literally anywhere outside the US/US 🤔
Bill: Japanese are too polite to be racist.
Bill: Also house manager is stupid, you check that out ASAP.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): asap: wednesday <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> and hope it's something he can fix and i don't have to wait around longer
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's a weird racism. it's a bit different than racism in the US, but the inferior feeling is still there. a lot of japanese see foreigners in one of two ways.
1.) attractive white people. funny rich dancing monkeys from fairy tales who do dumb things and are like TV stars. 
2.) everyone else. morons who trash everything, are dirty, are impolite and ruin the country.

no matter which category you're in you're still scary and hard to approach. people get fear in their eyes just seeing you. I get so many stares. also people refuse to sit next to you on the train unless they absolutely have to. they assume you speak no japanese (reasonable assumption since 95% of foreigners here don't) and they get so uncomfortable that it makes things awkward.

not everyone is like this (am i being racist 😱 ) but a considerable amount. like, I can't go to the sento because they'll probably find me a scary nuisance that will freak out their other guests and make a huge mess and break all the social customs of the bath.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): which i probably will but i just wanna be cleeean
Bill: You’ve got conversational Japanese skill though... once you start talking you can disarm them.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): have you ever seen that video
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): of uhhh
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLt5qSm9U80
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's 100% true, i'm technically qualified for business japanese and even if i was fluent people would be like <:lenny:395307171539189760> "pls leave"
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): well actually they can only ask you to leave if it's a store or a restaurant. otherwise they just make you feel really unwelcomed.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the places run by foreigners though are SUPER welcoming they're like "hey we saw you get discriminatory service there. come here we'll give you the best service ever."
Bill: Pfft.
Bill: Never seen that.
Bill: *Its 2018, white people speak japanese*
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): えぇぇーー！？何？うそ
Bill: Backtracking for a second, you shouldn’t care if Hal pisses and moans. And some point he must have realized he alienated himself from the best thing that ever happened to him, which had to be *dumb* luck it happened in the first place because you are so much better than him. If he’s bitter about it, he lost. You dodged the bullet of his toxic ass showing up 3 years into the relationship and the bullet of dating he who will always be a deadbeat working Starbucks. You haven’t even *lost* anything, since you have a presumably far better guy now. It took less than a week for a better person to find you. Be thankful he left, cause you’ve lost nothing and gained much more.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): tis a little suspicious how fast he and meg got together
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): (actually that sounds really horrible im deletin it
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): CUTE APRON
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): YEAH IT'S FUZZY ON THE INSIDE AND HAS A BEAR POCKET
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): OMG AND FUZZY
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yo I could fall back to sleep last night because my mind was making counter arguments to hals BS
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): what were they? owo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im gonna re-read it just to make myself fired up again
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): do a live commentary
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): everyone be like "icy hot condoms exist?" and im like ~~i ve known that since i was like 15 I am curropt~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "Does Kiris dick get as hard as his body?" of course it do
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): icyhot condoms suck if anyone wants a first hand experience pm me
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ***jess***
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im sorry mawisa
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): https://media.tenor.com/images/55c089a4480108dde4b5bec69b48be5b/tenor.gif

has NOTHING to do with the body part itself but is a combination of cleanliness and the persons diet
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and hormones ofc
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it has to do with the phases of the moon and how recently you've buried a frseh acorn in the dirt
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): valient effort on trying to keep that convo relevent <@!351785752197201920>
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): I tried
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hal needs to be Scienced on how thw body works
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~boi up in here acting like he a sex master or someshit~~
