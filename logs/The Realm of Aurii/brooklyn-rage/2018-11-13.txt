Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Everything else is just flavah
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ye. I wrote an e-mail to the boss that was a bit personal-ish (outlining that I've got 6 classes and no time for work anymore, they knew when hiring me that I was a student and allowed me to prioritize school), and then I've had an actual letter sitting in my files for like 2 weeks that I attached as a formal statement of resignation. I just changed the date on it owo
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): That sounds perfect
