Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The roads are so bad ðŸ˜­
Bill: Iâ€™mma do a concern, especially given my areas hills.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea understandable
Bill: Was expecting rough travel, was not expecting blizzard conditions.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I don't think the town's were ready at all.  I called work to leave a message that I'd be late and one of my managers picked up and said he just gave up and is gonna sleep at work ðŸ˜‚
Bill: Jeezus.
Bill: Call out tomorrow.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea. And he owns a 4 wheel drive truck
Bill: I know theyâ€™ve been alive twice as long as me and dad literally taught me how to drive in snow, but I worried.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's still dangerous tho
Bill: Yeah, I mean theyâ€™re more equipped to deal with it than I am, so itâ€™s not like I need to help.
Bill: I donâ€™t like not being about to *do* something when Iâ€™m bothered though.
