Total Nok-out (Marisa): **Part 8**
Minnie barely made it to the table in time before dropping the bowl and its piping hot contents on a trivet. Her journey back to the kitchen was spent shaking her hands to cool them off before picking up the next dish. “Let me lend you a hand,” Amelia insisted, whisking an item away from the stove before Minnie could protest. The dish was *hot* and she hoped the skin on her hand wouldn’t blister from it. Nothing fell out as it was partially thrown onto the table, and Amelia considered that a victory.

Lured by the scent of food, people began gathering around the table. First was Walter who nodded and took a seat, followed by Doris who chimed “There you are! Sit next to me, here,” and pulled out a chair at the overly cramped table.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Minnie came along with serving utensils and began dishing out helpings just as Abe and a young man, presumably Judas, entered from a closed bedroom. Abe was a gruff man several man Doris’s senior and his age seemed to be catching up, streaking his long brown hair with tufts of grey. He had a heart of gold concealed within a steely exterior. He sat at the head of the table and eyed the food hungrily. “Oh. What are you doing here?” he asked Amelia bluntly, as though she were a giraffe in an aquarium.

Doris took over before Amelia could open her mouth, regaling him with events of the last few hours while Abe just took it in. The young man with slick stone black hair and muddy green eyes smiled charmingly and sat down across from Amelia. He was impeccably dressed and obviously paid careful attention to his appearance. “Pleasure to meet you,” he said, laying a pair of white gloves across his lap while reaching out a hand. “Judas Donner. Sounds like you’ve had quite the day? Glad you’re in one piece.” He looked Amelia over, easing any tension between them with the silly gesture of making sure she was ok while also thoroughly examining her. She was glad she re-did her hair.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Minnie interrupted the chatter by signaling it was time to eat before the food got cold, now that everyone had a plate in front of them. Chicken soup with biscuits and a chestnut and vegetable salad. Amelia’s portion was considerably smaller than the rest of the family’s. Her soup was mostly broth and her salad was mainly chestnuts, which were easily obtainable in this season within the town. Judas’s food was also lacking, though had slightly more than Amelia. They were both topped up with tea, and a hush fell over the table as Abe said grace. 

After a moment’s silence, Abe picked up his fork and began to eat, and everyone else followed suit. “Delicious as always dear,” Walter said as he pecked Minnie on the check.
“Yes, exquisite. Thank you for your hospitality. And good game, Mr. Butch, I look forward to our poker rematch” said Judas - revealing what the two had been doing in the locked room - before turning to Amelia. “Pardon my rudeness, but I didn’t catch your name.”
Total Nok-out (Marisa): *TLDR; It’s dinnertime. Everyone chows down to eat. Amelia meets Judas, and they both have less food than the rest of the family.*
