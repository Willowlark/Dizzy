No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): **Part 23** 🌇 🐦 🦁 🌳 🐡
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): The trio sat silently munching for a few minutes. Eating in company was more pleasant than eating alone, even if the company was awkward.

"So, Miss Robin? Where is this place?" Judas asked innocently with a wince as he carelessly tried to move his lame arm. He preferred conversation with his dinner. Robin rolled her eyes and cracked a nut open, flicking its shell in his direction.

"Looks like a village? But an old one," Amelia said, peering outside at the setting sun. "Have you always lived here?"

Robin started, "this was a town. At one point. I visited it as a kid but I guess everyone left or died. Dunno when. All of our towns are getting like this now and it sure sucks. I wanna preserve it if I can."

"There are more like this in the forest?" Amelia marveled.

Judas was impressed. "We didn't pass any roads or paths. They're just, there?"

"Sure are, but I won't say where." Robin served Judas another heaping serving of disdain. "Aren't you familiar with this forest?" 

"Not too much, only from the outside, truthfully." Amelia admitted. "How far is this from the city?"
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "Not far. You'll find out tomorrow." Robin winked.

Judas tried to nudge his way into Robin's favor again, asking "are you really the only one here? Don't you get lonely?"

"Well if you *must* know, yeah. It's me. Sometimes someone else will pop by. Lost kids, but also some friends I know on occasion. It's rare and it's because you all destroyed this nation. Wasn't like this before!"

Judas raised his eyebrows, nodded, and decided to let Amelia do the talking.
"So you stay here by yourself? Do you ever leave the forest?"

"Oh, I leave. I wander. But there's no place like home, y'know? My family's lived here - this forest - for generations and I don't want to leave that all behind. Call me sentimental."

"But..." Amelia was hesitant. "This place is... kind of a mess? I don't even see any items that are really salvageable...."

"That's what these are for." Robin held out her arm and pulled up her mantle. Judas started choking on the jerky he was slowly chewing, and turned around. He became extremely focused on slowly drinking water from their supply and chewing his food extremely thoroughly in the opposite direction while Robin was showing off her tattoos. They were black and intricately done. Some were artful masterpieces and others had the shaky uncertain movements of a beginner. "Each of these tell a story," she explained.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "Wow!! I've never seen such a thing." Amelia traced one along Robin's wrist. "Did you do all of these?"

"A few," Robin sheepishly admitted. "But obviously I can't reach my back."

"Didn't it hurt?"

"Pfft. Hardly."

After several very hydrated minutes in which Robin explained each piece's meaning and how they were etched into her skin, Judas timidly spoke up. "This is all very fascinating and I do love hearing the process, but have you finished going over the tattoos yet?"

Before Amelia could respond, Robin strongly cursed him out. He nodded understandingly. "I think I'll turn in early. Still uh. Not feeling the best." Judas had barely touched his food and packed up the partially eaten remains as best he could before leaning back and shutting his eyes. He opened them again quickly. "This *is* where I'm sleeping, right?" After an affirmative grunt from Robin, Judas smiled in thanks and shut his eyes once more. He looked very uncomfortable.

Amelia wanted to help, but knew Robin would object, so she decided to wait until Robin left. In the meantime, she was still filled with curiosity and still in the process of filling her stomach.

"So how do you live by yourself in this forest?"
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Robin snorted. "What, like it's hard?" 

"I mean, you were able to be so friendly with our griffon right off the bat! What's your secret?"

The griffon in question was currently curled up outside. She was free to come and go into the tent as she pleased, but preferred the outdoors.

Robin thought for a moment. "There's no trick. Lots of animals are friendly like that, they just like scritches and cuddles. Be nice to them and they'll be nice to you, y'know?" She spoke as though all animals were big hug machines.

"Yeah, I guess. Maybe I smell bad. It might take a while yet for her to warm up to me," Amelia sighed dejectedly. "What about those river things? The eel-like ones. Are they friendly too? They tried to kill us."

"The waka-game?" Robin was incredulous. "Uh, yeah! They're *super* friendly. A little standoffish but they won't do you any harm. They always help. Their predictions are always accurate so heed their warnings. Saved me once from an infection, too. They're probably furious at you because *somebody*," Robin raised her voice and Judas flinched, "was shooting them for sport. Honestly, what is *wrong* with you?" 

She scarfed down the rest of her dinner and stood up hastily. "I'm going to bed. Amelia, our tent is the one in the center of camp." Then she left, angry footsteps fading away into the dark and starry night.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): **TLDR:** Robin talks about herself and doesn't hide her hatred of Judas. Judas's arm is lookin' bad and he's not eating. Time for bed.
