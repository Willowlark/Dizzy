one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Part 4 💍 

“Hey!” Her voice was stern and commanding and rumbled like the thunder outside. “What in the heavens is going on up here?” One of the bats spread its wings and began to squeak as if to say *shut up, we’re trying to get some shut-eye.* Amelia ignored it. The squirrels also continued to ignore her until she marched right over and plucked the object out of their furry little paws. It was weightier than she expected, as though there was something inside. “You critters have dinged this up enough. It isn’t a nut.” Inspecting it closely, Amelia realized she had no idea what it was. A decoration? A container? “Where did you even get this?”

There was some confusion on the ground now that the squirrels’ prize had been pilfered. Most of the gang scurried back to their nest, aware that they were now overpowered by a bigger creature. Two brave souls angrily began to nip and scratch at Amelia’s legs. One managed to claw its way up to her thigh and leave a nasty bite before she impulsively swatted it across the room. Mini skirts were not the most protective of leg wear, but that is the price one pays for fashion.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Amelia winced partially due to the pain and partially because she accidentally dropped the object she was trying to rescue. It thudded against the ground with a sound like a limp basketball, chipping the top. She scooped it up in her arms and hurried for the ladder downstairs, kicking any squirrels that tried to latch back onto her leg. The sudden quarrel roused the colony and as Amelia grabbed the ladder’s top rung, the attic was covered in a veil of flapping black wings which blocked the aggressive squirrels from her view.

She descended the ladder swiftly. Of course she forgot about the missing fifth step, tripped, and fell the rest of the way down, but the object was now snug in her arms and did not sustain further damage. The attic was hastily re-sealed and by some miracle nothing had followed Amelia into the bedroom. She put the object with the rest of her possessions and breathlessly threw herself onto the big bed to regain her composure. The sudden bolt of lightning which struck right outside did not help. The back door could be heard rattling in the fierce wind and rain pelted the building, making the buckets and bowls of rainwater in the front room sound like percussion band practice.
