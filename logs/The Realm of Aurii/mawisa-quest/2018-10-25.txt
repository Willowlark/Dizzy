Total Nok-out (Marisa): **Part 7** 🛑
Total Nok-out (Marisa): “Have you seen the state I’m in? I can’t possibly meet someone like this! Stars above!” Amelia planted her feet firm on the ground and grabbed on to the chair for support. 
“Nonsense, you’re as cute as a cabbage. Men love a damsel in distress, he may get instantly protective.”
“Not when they’re the source of distress!! Oh, Doris, at least let me comb my hair!”
The raised voices broke Walter’s concentration and he turned around in his seat. “What’s all this? Ma, what are you doin’ to the poor girl? She’s had a rough enough day.”

With a *harrumph* Doris begrudgingly nodded and let go. “Alrighty. You’re right. Maybe I’m jumping the gun on this a bit.” Amelia also nodded and breathed a sigh of relief, letting her shoulders droop, while Doris continued. “Fine, fine. There’s a basin in the washroom you can use, ask Minnie for a spare robe and we’ll dry your clothes. You go freshen up a bit and I’ll set the scene.” Amelia nervously smiled, unsure exactly what was meant by *setting the scene*, but she knew a break when she saw one and decided to just go along with it.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): “Thanks again Walter, I owe you twofold,” she called as she exited the room in search of Minnie. Minnie was not far. In fact, she was just a step ahead and greeted Amelia with an armful of fabric. “Just an old apron, but it oughta fit you. It’ll work fine until your clothes are dry. Leave your outfit hanging on the door after you change and I’ll hang it over the fire for you.”

In the bathroom, Amelia undid her hair and let it droop. The humidity made it frizzy and uncooperative, but at its full length it went to her knees. For around twenty minutes she just sat, brushing and relaxing and worrying about what Doris would do when she was done. She took her good old time re-styling the hair into buns, and wiped down her oily skin with a cloth, taking extra care to blot her eyes back to a normal state. When finally content, Amelia put on the thin dress and apron she was given, pulling the collar up high as was her style. 

By the time she was finished it was dark, and supper was being set. “We’re going to eat in the dining room, but mom was waiting for you first,” Minnie squeaked as she hurried by, shifting an extremely hot bowl between her gloved hands.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): TLDR; Amelia is squeaky clean!
