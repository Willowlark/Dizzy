Total Nok-out (Marisa): **Part 5** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 

Amelia moved to her bedside and quickly wrapped its contents up in the sheet they sat atop of. She wanted to protect the possessions before water damage began to affect them, especially the portrait. She didn’t quite know what to do, but knew that staying in the house any longer would be risky. Access to the front room was blocked so Amelia and her sack of items climbed out the back wall.

The ground was covered in roots and wet leaves, and the well-worn paths that were usually safe to walk on had become excessively slippery with mud. The nearest neighbors lived in a duplex a hundred feet away. Amelia set out for that house next door, overly conscious of her footing and blinded by the rain. Halfway there she heard the splashing of something approach, and glanced up.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): A man with curly brown hair drawn back into a ponytail approached. He was hurrying, and Amelia graciously accepted his aid when he shielded her from the storm with an oversized coat. He guided her into the left half of the duplex where a thin woman with similar shoulder-length brown curls waited anxiously at the door, opening it as they reached the porch. She was jittery and wouldn’t hold still. “Oh deary, are you alright? Are you unhurt? We saw out the window and it gave us an awful fright, we feared the worst might have happened. What an awful noise it made. Scared the daylights out of me, I was just about to go rushing over myself. Come inside, quickly, quickly.” 

Amelia was ushered inside the tiny room, which was warm and well-lit and welcoming. The man from before was removing his boots by the door and taking off his own coat. “Thank you Walter, I really appreciate it,” Amelia told him as she laid her sack of possessions against the wall. She was soaked from head to toe, and took off her mud-soaked shoes.

“Think nothing of it, just glad you’re alright,” he replied with a smile. “Minnie spotted you coming around back and basically threw me out the door to get you.”

Minnie herself was walking into the room carrying towels and hot drinks. She was Walter’s wife, the epitome of a good caretaker, with wavy brown hair that fit right in with the rest of the Burch family. She had a special way of making people calm with her quiet demeanor and always smelled of flowers, which might have been in part due to the yellow buds sprouting from her right ear. People say she smelled delightfully before those grew in, though. Her hair only reached chin-level, indicting her status as a newlywed.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Amelia walked around to Minnie’s left side to thank her and the girl smiled demurely. The jittery woman, Walter’s mother Doris, pushed a chair under Amelia’s legs and a cup of tea into her hands. “Here, sit by the fire and you’ll dry faster. Can’t have you catching one of those awful… vireses… that people have been going on about.”

“Right you are,” Walter chimed in as he downed a cup of tea to warm himself back up. The storm continued to rage outside. “Are you unhurt? We’ll set you up somewhere to rest for the night, though we’re a little overbooked right now. Pops is in the other room with a guest from out of town. Friend of a friend it seems. Business matters.”
“Son of a friend,” Doris corrected. “Such a nice fellow.” Her voice dropped, “might I add he’s a looker, deals in trade, and possibly looking for a lady friend?”
“Oh, mother! Leave the poor girl be!” Minnie’s voice was teasing but her statement was firm and she tenderly patted Amelia on the shoulder. “Can I get you anything? Another towel, more to drink?”
Total Nok-out (Marisa): *TLDR; Amelia makes it to the neighbor's house. They are nice people.*
