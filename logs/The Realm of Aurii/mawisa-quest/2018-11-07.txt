No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): **Part 13** ❔ 

Amelia had never seen anything like this creature in her life, though she’d heard tales of similar things. “I… I don’t know what you’re talking about. What is yours? What do you want?” she asked curiously, not wanting to offend or aggravate it.

It paused, as though inhaling. “Sunet. My sunet.” The creature rattled and shook discontentedly. “I made it. Making it took a long time. Then it was gone. It was stolen and I want it back. It wasn’t even finished yet. Give it to me.”

Amelia had absolutely no idea what that was. “What does it look like?”

“It’s one of a kind. It’s my sunet, there are none others like it.” This answer was not helpful.
