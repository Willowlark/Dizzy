N🆗ri (Marisa): **Part 28**
N🆗ri (Marisa): You move towards the overturned carriage in the middle of the road. The driver is already trying to prop it up with his shoulder, but he wasn't the strongest of men. Traffic begins to pile up behind him as people gripe and groan, calling for hi to hurry it up. People have places to be, you know!
The driver laughs as you come up to aid him. "I've got this covered lass," he tells you, out of breath and obviously not in control of the situation. Before you have the opportunity to get your hands dirty though you are softly pushed aside by the bald streetfood man and several others. "Leave this to us." They sound exasperated, as though carriages often tip over in this part of the city, and they're always left to clean up the mess. You stand behind them for a minute still determined to help, but there isn't even space to grab the carriage with all the people now helping, so you retreat.

Your attention now shifts to the map of the city. It's beautifully ornate and still perfectly readable, if obviously weathered. They must repaint it every year. Even though the area you're currently in is called the downtown, it's more centrally located. The hospital you came from is clearly labelled several blocks over, as is city hall, the fire station, and numerous police stations. The further from the center something is, the less detailed it is on the map, until the outer city limits are just a swirly blur of paint.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The communications center seemed to be a fifteen minute walk northeast, in the business district. It would take at least an hour to go and come back, possibly more if they were busy and had long lines in wait. However, it was also near the guild headquarters, where someone surely knew Judas and could be told of his circumstances in the hospital.

Something labelled nickelodeon caught your eye, right down the road. You had heard of these so-called theaters but never been to one yourself, and just so happened to have a few nickels. But if you were needed at the hospital it would be hard to reach you inside.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pick one!:

📬 : Go to the communications center to get in contact with your uncle
