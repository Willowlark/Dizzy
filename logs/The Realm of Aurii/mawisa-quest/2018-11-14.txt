No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): **Part 16** 👫
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): "I'm going to go with you," Amelia said. Judas did not argue.

With a mere stick and the early stars to light the way through the young night, Amelia and Judas walked down to the riverbank together. Amelia wasn't sure what would happen, but was apprehensive to leave Judas to do it alone. In whispers, Judas asked about the last place she saw the creature, and she led him to the spot. The pair peered through the darkness from the shelter of the treeline. The being was still there, eyes closed and unmoving. Coiled around its so-called sumet.

Judas motioned to stay low and inched forward. Autumn leaves crunched under his feet while Amelia was more light-footed and silent. With a deep exhale, Judas took aim and fired at the creature. The shot was deafening in close quarters and Amelia wished he had warned her. The boom echoed and startled some birds in the distance, then everything but the river fell silent again.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): The creature started to emit a high-pitched wail, like a child's scream. A distress call. Judas swore under his breath, exhaled again, and fired twice more. When the wailing abruptly stopped he stood and fired one last shot, then rushed over. Shiny tar was pouring out of the creature from bullet holes in its head, and from the sumet underneath it. The creature was so thin that the bullet went right through and into the container, finally piercing through. It emitted a rancid rotting smell so horrid that Judas threw up several times trying to pry the creature off of it, and Amelia's eyes teared up as she remained along the treeline. She had a sinking feeling that something would go very wrong. "I think we should go," she voiced. "Now."

Judas nodded and motioned that he'd be right there. The limp creature was in his hands, covering them in tar. With a tight grip he dipped it in the water as though to wash it off. "What are you doing?" Amelia hissed. He couldn't hear her from the water's edge, but as a leather trader he had a great interest in the creature's hide and hoped it would fetch a nice price.

A shadow passed in front of Amelia and her blood ran cold. It was another of the same creature filled with bloodthirsty intent. Its sharp fangs were not just for decoration, and more were surely following.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): *TLDR; creature is dead. danger approaching in the form of more creatures.*
