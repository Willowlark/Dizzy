No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): **Part 9** 🚗 🎴  🍛
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): “Oh! Pleasure to meet you! Were you playing cards just now?” Amelia asked, reaching out to shake his hand. Judas nodded quizzically. “Yes. You see, Mr. Butch was showing me a thing or two, poker’s a common pastime among salesmen… He’s truly skilled… Ahem.” He picked up his fork and began to dig in.

“Don’t be modest, you’ve got a good poker face there,” Abe mumbled in between slurps of soup. “Tripped me up good a couple a times. You’ll run a fine business if ya keep it up.”

“Really?” Walter perked up. “If you’ve got time later I’d fancy a round against you.”

Judas brushed off the complement and agreed to the new challenge while Amelia kept up the chatter. “Doris told me you’re heading out for the city in the morning? It may be abrupt of me, but may I join you?”

Whatever poker face he had was not in play now, as Judas’s eyebrows jumped up in surprise. “Why yes, I do intend to leave bright and early, weather permitting. Why? Are you interested in the city? That is indeed a sudden request, Miss, uh… hm…”
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): “Amelia, dear!” Doris interjected. “This is Amelia, Amelia Fitzotto. Please pardon her, she’s had a rough day, as you’ve heard. Dear, hurry and eat before your food gets cold, you need to regain your strength.”

Amelia blushed and nodded, stuffing some greens and chestnuts into her mouth to hide her awkward wince.
The name rang a bell to Judas. “Fitzotto, the oil traders?” 

“That’s the one! Her uncle’s the breadwinner of the family but he’s been gone for some time,” Doris explained.

“I’d like to go to the telecommunications center and put out a message,” Amelia stated between bites.

Walter, Minnie, and Abe began their own discussion about what a good idea it was to patch up the roof earlier that week. Judas thought for a bit while chewing. “I have nothing against it, but are you sure? It’s dangerous, it’ll take a few days. Would you be comfortable with that?” His implication being, *are you comfortable travelling with a man for several days?*

Amelia nodded. “There’s not much I can do here unless my uncle returns.” She scooped the last of the soup into her mouth, leaving the bowl so empty it looked clean. “Minnie, could I bother you for seconds?”

Minnie hesitated for the briefest of moments before accepting the bowl. She scooped a ladleful of soup and returned it to Amelia alongside another plate of chestnuts. The soup was entirely clear broth, with no chicken or solids whatsoever. Doris gave Amelia a side glance, as though worried about her mental state.

“Well, if you can meet me ready to go at dawn then we can set out,” Judas said. The atmosphere felt a bit strained, and Amelia remained silent after saying her thanks while Walter and Abe discussed the best local fishing spots.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ------------
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): After dinner, Amelia and Minnie cleaned up while Doris rigged together a resting spot for Amelia in the living room. The night became quiet as the storm faded away, but Amelia had difficulty sleeping anyway. She rose easily with the sun and quietly changed back into her own clothing. Minnie was the next to rise, to get the house’s affairs in order to start the day. Judas emerged shortly after, followed by Walter. “Ready to set off?” he asked. “Our ride is parked in the shed. I was planning on cutting through the forest to make the trip shorter, but that could be risky for a maid like yourself. Would you prefer to stick to roads? It’ll add maybe three or four days to the trip.”
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): *TLDR; Dinner is awkward. Amelia manages to cover her lack of manners up by using her stressful day as an excuse. Judas agrees to take her anyway.*
