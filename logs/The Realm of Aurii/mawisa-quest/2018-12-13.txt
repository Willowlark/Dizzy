秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): **Part 25** 🏥
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): “Officer! He-hey, officer!” Amelia clambered down from the griffon while the cop took out a pad of paper and began writing. “We need medical help, please. My friend here is in pain and is gravely injured and – is there a hospital around? A doctor, anything?” 

As she continued to pepper the silence with small squeaks of “please,” the officer looked up at Judas’s slumped over figure and bandaged arm, then to Amelia’s puppy dog appearance. His blank gaze lingered on her face for an uncomfortable amount of time. There was roughly a minute of awkward silence. “I don’t mind the ticket, I just need to get him some help first. Please sir.”

The officer spoke again in the same monotonous tone as before, “you remind me of someone.”
*O…. kay? Someone good or someone bad?* Amelia thought, lost for words. *We don’t have time for that. Is this guy really a cop?*

“He has a deep bite on his arm and I think he’s been poisoned. His entire arm’s gone black and blue. Please, time is of the essence,” she reiterated, stressing the importance of how badly they needed medical help.

“A T six-three eleven A. Only the main hospital is equipped to handle such an emergency.” The cop finally broke his weird eye contact to put away the notepad. “It is north of the commercial district. I can escort you, please follow me either on foot or mounted. And be sure to obey the traffic laws this time.” Without hesitation the officer turned and began to walk away. The gaggle of curious onlookers scattered like roaches as he left, leaving Amelia to scramble back to the griffon in confusion.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): TLDR; Cop is weird and stares at Amelia until her repeated insisting makes him offer to guide them to the hospital.
