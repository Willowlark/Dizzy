No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Part 11 🚰
A fire was lit and Judas began to toss various nuts and plants into the flames, roasting a late meal for the travelling duo. Among his luggage was a canteen and several small pots. “I’ll head down to the riverbank, get us some fresh water,” Amelia told him. The river was close. Even if it wasn’t visible, its steady current could be easily heard from their camping location. 

“Oh, I appreciate it,” he responded. I’ll make the beds then. You think it’s gonna rain tonight? Should I tie up a cover?”

Amelia glanced up at the cloudless sky. “Naw. Shouldn’t. The only thing we should worry about falling from the sky are owls. We should be okay?” She appreciated that Judas was taking her opinion into account. Any time a decision was made, Judas would request her input and seriously consider it. He attributed it to being unfamiliar with the area and being cautious, but it was still nice. “Holler if anything happens,” he said as Amelia walked off, carrying the canteen and two pots.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): The water reflected the setting sun beautifully, its currents rippling and sparkling. It was fresh and would not need to be filtered. This forest was pure. Fish would occasionally pop out and glisten in the light before diving back into the water with a splash. Amelia walked parallel to the river in search of a good spot to gather water. Getting too close without a good foothold would be dangerous. If she fell in, she probably would not live to climb out again. Fifteen minutes into her walk, a silty beach came into view. It was right at water level and tiny waves drifted off from the current to wash up on shore. Perfect.

The canteen and pots were topped up with fresh water, and Amelia took a long drink to rehydrate herself. She admired the view for a little before a thought struck her. Aside from the occasional fish, she hadn’t seen any animals near this river. No birds or rodents or even a bug of any kind. The sky was turning purple and Amelia had the sudden desire to get back to camp immediately. The canteen was tucked away and she went to lift the pots, but paused. Something could be heard moving ever so faintly. It sounded like the wind and the waves, almost unperceivable, but sent a chill up Amelia’s spine. She knew she was being watched, but there was nothing around.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): TLDR; gonna get water but something is off. Something is near?
