No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): **Part 12** 🚶 

Amelia continued forward as slow as molasses. Goosebumps popped up on her arms quicker than she could take a step forward. It would take her hours to return to Judas at this rate, but better to be safe than worry when facing an unknown adversary. She managed to take a few steps forward when something spoke, hardly a whisper. “You have something of mine.”

This confirmed that Amelia was not alone. Yet again, she could not find the source. Not until it revealed itself first. Amelia spotted it and jumped, spilling water on the already wet rocks. The being was about three feet away and was roughly six feet in length, hovering stilly above the sand. Its eyes and skin were black as night. It looked like a garden eel with a mouth of uneven, razor-sharp protruding teeth. Amelia could not see it before because the creature was thin. So thin - thinner than paper from the front - that it was practically invisible unless viewed from the side. It did not blink or move any further, just observed her in the corner of its vision. “Give it to me,” it spoke. Its mouth did not move when talking, but seemed to extend, enhancing its teeth that would make any dentist faint.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): TLDR; what the fudge is that thing? it wants something from Amelia.
