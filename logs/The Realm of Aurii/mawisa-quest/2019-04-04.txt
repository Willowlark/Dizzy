N🆗ri (Marisa): **Part 30** 🛎 🙂 
*Ding!* The bell on the counter is louder than expected, and rings throughout the building. The voices in back speed up for a bit before coming to a halt. Several loud footsteps later, a tall man emerges. He has black hair streaked with grey, tied up into a messy bun atop his head that looks as if it would spill out at any moment. His sideburns and beard are similarly long yet neatly groomed. He greets you with a gravelly "welcome, welcome," as he walks towards the counter, as though a lifetime of cigarettes has permanently altered his voice. "How can I help you, miss?"

You smile calmly, asking "Is this the guild of Judas Donner?"
The receptionist scoffs at you, and was that an eye roll? "He's out. Business trip, won't be back for some time. Try again in a few weeks. Can I help you with anything else today?"
"Oh, yes. I know he's out. But this is his guild? You are...?"
"I am Charles Day, the master here. Donner is a member here, yes. If you need him for anything you can ask me, but otherwise he's not free." He states this sternly while staring you down.
"With all due respect sir, Judas is in the hospital. I've brought your griffon back here if you need proof, but he's got a nasty bite. I just thought someone here ought to know."
Charles's eyes widen and he looks past you to the open door, then back to you. He considers this a moment. "What exactly happened?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): You recount the story in simple terms. "Well I'll be," Charles says. "That better be some pelt he's brought back or I'll bite 'is arm off myself." He belly laughs and it echos the same way the bell did. "Aah. Well, thanks for comin' all this way to tell us. We better send someone down there to look after him." Part of the counter swings up, startling you and causing Charles to laugh again. Seems he's quite the prankster. "You're welcome to come back, sounds like you've been through quite the ordeal. Looks like it too. We can get you something to drink and a towel as thanks for not runnin' off with our bird, or leavin' Donner for dead." He begins walking away.
N🆗ri (Marisa): **TLDR;** The guild is now aware that Judas is in the hospital. They offer you some refreshments.

Pick one!:
🍵 : Accept the offer and follow the guildmaster
🤚 Decline the offer and go to the communication center
🏥 : Decline the offer and go back to the hospital yourself
🤑 : Realize your missed opportunity and go back to steal what the griffon is carrying
