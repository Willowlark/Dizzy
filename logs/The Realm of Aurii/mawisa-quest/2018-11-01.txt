No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): **Part 10** 🌳
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): The Burch family gave their regards to the two with a quiet yet hearty sendoff while the sun was still rising. The day was cloudless and crisp, with a blanket of condensation covering the ground. Walter helped Amelia carry her bag to the shed where their ride waited, bantering with Judas about manly things. “Have a safe trip then. Oh, and Amelia, send us a letter when you get there.”
“I certainly will. Thank you for all your hospitality, I really owe you,” As Walter headed back, Amelia turned to Judas. “I really appreciate you going out of your way to take me.”
“Think nothing of it,” he said while fiddling with the shed door. 
“No, truly. I don’t want to be a burden, so lets stick to your original plan of going through the woods.”
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): “Are you certain?” Judas sounded slightly taken aback, as though he expected Amelia to take the cushy option instead. In their brief interactions thus far he had thought of her as a spoiled, sheltered girl.

“I’ve lived alongside this forest for years, there’s nothing to worry about inside it if we keep to ourselves and hurry through.” Amelia’s tone was confident. She trusted that the forest would not harm them.

Inside the shed, their ride perked up its head. Amelia gasped at the rare sight. A large griffon which took up most of the space inside the shed struggled to squeeze itself out of the doorway. The fur had been trimmed extremely short on its muscular feline body, and its wings were clipped. “This our ride?” Amelia asked breathlessly.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): Judas chuckled. “Isn’t she pretty? First time seeing one? She belongs to our guild, the best watchdog and travelling companion you could ask for.”

The griffon stretched and observed Amelia through a glistening gold eye, digging its front talons into the soil like a cat kneading a blanket. Judas outfitted her with a saddle and side bags to carry their luggage, which tucked away neatly under her folded wings, before hoisting himself up. “It’s like riding a horse or a chimera. Can you do it?” Offering a hand, he hoisted Amelia up and she settled into place behind him.

---------------------
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): The two travelled all day, stopping only twice to rest and relieve themselves. They munched on roasted chestnuts, and Judas had dried meat for their chauffeur to consume. The forest was dense but the griffon was able to navigate it swiftly with little issue, weaving through the trees and trampling over the dense leafy understory. Amelia was fascinated by its muscles. Her and Judas chatted about many things, such as the griffon and the current state of the leather industry. 

When the sky was tinged with orange and pink and the sun was at the edge of the sky, they decided to stop. Several hours before they came across a river and followed its winding path. “This here will do fine for the night,” Judas said as he halted the griffon about 150 feet from the riverbank, midway up a small grassy hill. “I have some old pelts we can use for bedding, so feel free.” He unclipped the bags and set them down while patting and praising the griffon for a good day’s work, offering her a salted and dried lizard from their rations. Judas’s own stomach let out a long rumble, and he and Amelia laughed. “Feeling hungry?” he asked her. “Lets get some light going before the sun fully sets.”
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): TLDR; Forest travel begins, Amelia and Judas are riding a cool griffon through the woods. They move all day and finally stop to camp out for the night.
