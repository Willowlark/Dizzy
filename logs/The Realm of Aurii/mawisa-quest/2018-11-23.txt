No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): **Part 19** 😮
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "Wwaaaiiit wait wait wAIT!!" Amelia moved forward, wanting to grab the girl but not wanting to face the end of her blade. "Don't hurt him!" The girl turned to face Amelia as though she had suddenly began shouting about tartan couches or some other insane topic. Her face seemed to say, *huh?*

"He's helping me, I need him," Amelia explained. "It is *very* important and I will be *very* troubled if you hurt him. Well, any more than he already is." The commotion seemed to be rousing Judas from his slumber of pain, and he groaned like a drunk waking up in the morning.

The tattooed girl made a face and reluctantly let him go. Juda's injured arm hung limply. "Fine. I won't go breaking whatever contract you have with him. Doesn't look like he's much help to you like this, though." Her face showed she was curious about what exactly this important favor was, but unwilling to question Amelia. Amelia realized she had been mistaken as some kind of faerie, who are quite cunning and whose secrets cost very dearly. This might play in her favor.
