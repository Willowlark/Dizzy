秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): **Part 24** 🔻
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Amelia watched Robin leave while sitting still, finishing up her dinner by thoughtfully munching a leaf. Robin was a nice girl, but still a stranger she knew little about. Judas was a man, but he was also quite injured and posed no threat to her, so Amelia resolved to stay with him for the night. Judas had already fallen asleep, and so Amelia curled up as snugly as she could and hoped that things would turn out better tomorrow.

It was a misty morning, the air thick with water droplets small enough not to soak one's clothing but noticeable enough to be a nuisance. Robin's shadow could be seen through the fabric wall playing with the griffon. "What time is it?" Amelia asked groggily. 
"Time to go," came Robin's response as she peaked her head inside. "Why'd you stay here last night?"

"Must've just fallen asleep after eating," Amelia fibbed. Judas was stirring but could barely even lift his head. His entire forearm had turned a nasty shade of purple from wrist to elbow, and the bite wound oozed. Amelia, with reluctant help and lots of "ew, ew, ew"-ing from Robin, managed to secure him onto the griffon, and then off they went on their merry way.

The trip was surprisingly short. Three hours at most, throughout which the girls made pleasant idle chatter. In due time the trees began to thin. The ground turned bumpy in sections where dirt concealed buried concrete, and rusting signs jutted out from leafy clumps. Soon enough inhabited buildings began dotting the landscape. "We have arrived at your destination," Robin chimed. She hesitated for a moment before jumping down, apparently forgetting she did not own the griffon. 

"You're not coming with us?" Amelia asked.
"Why would I? This was the deal. I'll be seeing you again."
"Wait! Could you at least point us towards the closest doctor or hospital? For, y'know..."
Robin stared blankly at Amelia. "I haven't got a clue. I hate this place. Unless there's anything else I can do for you, I'm out."
Amelia's shoulders sagged and she looked like a lost puppy, but she smiled and thanked Robin anyway, ignoring the guilt pawing at her chest. "Thanks anyway Robin. Be careful."
With a casual wave, Robin started walking back towards the woods, kicking stray chunks of concrete along the path.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Amelia didn't wait until she was out of sight. Instead, she willed the griffon to go swiftly. Buildings began to get bigger and closer together as they neared the city, and the closer they got the newer the buildings were. Brick wasn't fully encased in moss or chipped away, and the road became paved with minimal wear and tear. People were scurrying about from one residence to another on the drizzly mid-afternoon day, paying them little mind, and they all looked so busy Amelia didn't know who to ask.

Despite still being on the city's outskirts, she began to slow the griffon down with the intention of asking someone for help when a single shrill whistle cut the air. Amelia flinched, covering her ears from the loud noise as it approached. A man in an ironed blue uniform and black cap drew near, holding his hand out in a stop sign. "You, stay there," he called out in a deep monotonous tone.

He was a little taller than average and had dirty blonde hair. Like, really dirty. It looked as though someone had dumped a bucket of soil over his head, and maybe his hair was actually a light blonde. Even his face had discolored splotches where dust clung to his skin, and he smelled earthy from a distance. His uniform, however, was fine.

"Do you know how fast you were going? Far above the speed limit." He said in the same monotonous tone. Passerby were beginning to stare at the cop, the griffon, and the passed out passenger, letting their imagination run wild as to what happened.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): **TLDR**: You've made it to the city! Robin has left the party, and you've been pulled over for speeding on a griffon while Judas is, like, dying.
