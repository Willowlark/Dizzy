N🆗ri (Marisa): **Part 29**
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone at the guild was surely expecting Judas and would be worried if he didn't return on time. You decide to head there and tell them of his unfortunate circumstances. But first, you need a ride.
You retrace your steps to the hospital where Judas's griffon sits, grooming its arm feathers under an outside overhang. Popping inside for a moment, you find that Judas's status has not yet changed and that they're still operating. Figures. As you leave you tell the receptionist where you're going and of your eventual return, and she nods at you warmly. 

Getting the griffon to cooperate is still a monumental task. It looks annoyed and is slow to respond. But soon you're plodding through the streets at a mediocre pace, careful of getting another traffic violation and keeping your eyes peeled for landmarks to prevent getting lost. The trip goes well and the buildings change from tall, flashy glass storefronts to more subdued brick and concrete with few exterior markings. Moss reaches up the walls and algae stains the roofs. The people are less dressed up and donned in clothes more appropriate for manual labor. The next street, your supposed destination, is dotted with carts and crates and plenty of movement. An overwhelming mix of smells fills the air. Paint, wood, stone, dirt, metal, paper, rotten food, and more join forces to overwhelm the senses. It's unclear which building belongs to the clothworkers. All the men are in similar attire and the buildings seem to blend into one another. But as you hesitate, the griffon unswervingly moves forward and quite literally drops you off at one of many grey buildings, this one located near the end of the street.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The door is propped open, though no one is coming or going, and you knock twice as you enter. The room is well-lit and lavishly furnished with all sorts of expensive fabrics. A bear-skin rug lays in front of a spotless leather couch next to a circle of armchairs for guests. A counter covered in tapestries and fabric samples stands in between this room and an adjacent hallway. People are unmistakably talking further inside.
