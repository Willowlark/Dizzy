Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): If this was a presidential election the furries would have won
Aldus (Jess): Lmaoooo
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): So based on majority and combining the most popular results:
take place in the **past** (60% votes for past and 40% votes for present/future, so perhaps the **near past**)
the setting is **fantasy** (80% votes)
the main genres are **adventure** and **romance** (4 votes) with a bit of **horror** (3 votes). Some other lesser genres with 2 votes will get sprinkled in as well throughout time.
Told in the **third person** (60%, with 40% for first person)
Our protagonist is a **female**, aged between 15 and 24 (votes were tied between two categories) so they'll be around **18/19** years old.
Magic exists in the world, but our protagonist will have very little magical power (60% a little, 40% none).
Non-human races do exist and that's no secret. Furries, however. That is still up in the air <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Lemme know if anyone has major objections. Gonna start making the second survey in a bit.
Also!! if anyone is interested in a **post-apocalyptic** setting, react here with 💥. If you prefer a non-apocalyptic setting, react with 🕊.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Survey two! My brain is a bit fried but I figure the basics are there? And anything else can be worked out through the story. Companion may or may not be present from the start.

Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Oki. I have a general, very flexible plot outline and character draft that I made during the first half of class. I’ll make a world write-up and color image of the character when I get home tonight. If people are willing I can get the ball rolling on the quest this week. 
If *anything* seems wonky at any time at all or if you are against anything, please bring it up! I’m hoping this can be mildly entertaining and I’m not the best author so I’m incredibly open to any and all feedback 24/7 for a reasonable fee.
Elfriede (Tom): 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌

Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): gosh typing up a world guide is hard how do u do it biru
i have a pic of the protag y'all can critique while i type up this sham of a world outline. i cheated and used a character creator eyyy
Aldus (Jess): yay!
Bill: Do you need a world guide? I figured you were going to quest it and improv the lot of it.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): I have a basic world set up, I'm thinking most of it will be explained in-text as it goes along but some background would help.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): since this will end when aurii starts up again I have a few paths in mind for stories but those are also flexible
Bill: oh right I should start on that.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ~~hey guys here's my OC~~
since this is everyone's character and she'll be based around the answers given in the survey and the world setting (which i'll get to in a bit) she's still open to changes and critique so go ahead. questions also welcome.

Amelia Fitzotto. A human, albeit one with pointy ears which isn't so strange. She is 18 and lives in the remnants of a town bordering a dense forest. She lives with her uncle who appears to have gone missing after the natural death of his spouse. They are in the lighting business and so deal in oils and candles, an important staple in the town. She has long hair that gets tied up, a boyish reputation among girls her age, and somewhat unsightly birthmarks (a dot below her left eye and a long mark along her neck). However, she is not one to go searching for trouble and has a basic sense of duty.
Aldus (Jess): im love
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: What a perfect human
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Our world is an alternate Earth, in the first decade of the 1900s. Our protagonist resides in North America.
What national government that exists is weak. Instead, people are governed by their religion, the rules of nature, and the 'magic' within. Magic is the lifeforce within everything. People believe it is what causes the grass to grow and the wind to blow, and that these natural phenomena are conscious of worldly happenings. Religion is strongly policed within society. Magic isn’t necessarily something that people can control, but it can be persuaded. People can be blessed and cursed at nature’s whim, and a wide variety of creatures big and small exist.
Colonialism and competitive westward expansion have ravaged the land and innumerable wars and squabbles have tired out the population. Nature does not appreciate being claimed in the name of man and destroyed for selfish reasons. Buildings that have been built to last are being reclaimed by nature and are in dire need of repairs. As manpower is low and resources scare, repairs are only done when the building’s structural integrity is seriously threatened. There are many means of travel but it can be far from safe, and communication that is not done face-to-face is rarely trusted.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: So pre world wars but electricity is used and small inventions like toaoters and stuff exist? Or does power not function cuz it's post apocalyptic?
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Just curiousities
Bill: Sounds like electricity is part of the natural order, and since nature is pissed at human expansion electricity won't want to work.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): 1900s technology exists! i'm only familiar with how widespread electricity was in early 1900s japan so i might've mistakenly been thinking of that and i'll have to check what tecnology 1900s americans had. ~~i did a lot of research about cans for no reason~~.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): radio def exists.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): its reliability of getting a signal is another matter
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah it is also post apocalyptic so
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Generators I'm guesing
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: But bad ones
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> <@!350855105123319808> you're the history buffs.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: All homes in the us didn't have power til 1925
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: But electricity was discovered and utilized
Tikur (Kurtis): Really bad homemade generators wouldn't be bad
Tikur (Kurtis): Or like wind power
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: True windmills
Tikur (Kurtis): Yeee
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: That's not bad
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Or water wheels
Tikur (Kurtis): Mabey civilization it based on how much actually power you can accumulate
Tikur (Kurtis): Like if you live in the plains with alot of wind and you have a power "stockpile" you have more power
Tikur (Kurtis): Ah NVM just saw the world summary leeme read that
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): due to AU Earth settings i'm just gonna say 1900s america is equivalent to our earth's 1900s japan technology.
I'll say electric lighting was a novelty and just barely making its way to rural areas. since electric lighting is quite bright and messes with one's natural clock, beings that are close to nature are none too fond of it and religious folk are wary of artificial lighting in fear of angering something beyond their control. more newfangled people (like crazy inventors) and desperate colonialists may still use it.

similarly it may depend on the area. cities might make use of electric lighting more than rural areas, and our protagonist will be pretty rural. rich people have phones and there's definitely at least one or two in every village/town. gas and oil and coal (and a little bit of faith and wind too i guess?) are the main sources of power for generators. ~~we don't need to get too specific about where the power comes from kek~~
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): does that sound reasonable maybe
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): i enact the story rule of suspendible belief
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah for sure
Tikur (Kurtis): Yo this sounds dope as hell
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: It was more just curiosity than anything else
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: It just sounds really neeto so I wanted to know more
Bill: 
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): *kurtis join it*
all you'd have to do is vote for every new post
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): o last night i was looking up pictures to get a vibe of how the world might look let me see if i can find them again
Tikur (Kurtis): I'm down love me some au disaster earth
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Someone tag this boi next time there's a vote
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): so a large, still-functioning city might look like this minus the car and with sizable pathways (since people would still inhabit the city)
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): 
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): sights like this would not be out of the ordinary
Bill: So last of us.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ye but more inhabited
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I think it's closer to ughhhhhhhh
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: ***madeinabyss***
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: **calloutpost**
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): i spent so much money on made in abyss today don't do this to me
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): actually tho that's not a bad comparison. Made in Abyss's world, they still have technology but it's limited and rather old fashioned. imagine the town but with more nature
Bill: ~~tom doesn't like using pre existing anime worlds~~
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): 
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Made in abyss is an island
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: And is also a really fucking cool world setting
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: And really fucked up 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): can't wait for the movie 👌
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): I'm hoping the world will become clearer through the story, though of course you're free to ask questions any time
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yep yep
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): unless otherwise stated that something is *really weird*, it's probably normal. not an everyday occurrence, but also not totally out of the questoin.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): so when u guys wanna start <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): do we rush in blindly asap
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Whenever you want
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): while i get the first post done (i might wait until morning idk yet) i'll give time for those that aren't caught up to read stuffs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this sounds BA i likey
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): I'm typing up the first post now. This will need to have kinks worked out, but basically will go as follows:

The post will have multiple options at the end. All you need to do is vote for which option you want to happen the most. You can only vote for one option. If you think another course of action is more suitable, you can recommend it and others can choose to vote that instead. If there is a tie between votes, a compromise action will be made. The same might happen if the votes are really really close.
For example:
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): It is morning and Amelia wakes up.

🛀 She goes to take a shower.
🍞 She decides to make breakfast.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): [recommended action by a player] 1⃣ She goes back to sleep
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): You can only vote one but I'll put all the reactions at the bottom of the post to make voting easier and my vote can be disregarded.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): here we goooo ~~i hope this works critique is always welcome~~
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ```
As far as communities went, Pillwood was nothing special. The dense woods to the East provided a nice barrier against invaders who were unwilling to traverse the thick vegetation, and fresh water could be obtained from the river which flowed through town if you knew which polluted sections to avoid. Roughly six hundred folk called Pillwood their home and piled into its church twice a week. Without being boastful, the Pillwood library was also the town’s pride, having amassed the largest collection of intact volumes for miles around. But this was closely guarded as if word got out, surely pesky invaders would come for it.
Women kept the town afloat while most of its men ventured out in daylight to gather resources and worked to keep the place in running order. On this day, the usual smell of mid-afternoon lunch and dinner preparation was hampered by strong winds and a steady rain. Most citizens were indoors save for the odd errand-runner. A large storm was clearly en route.
```
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ```Amelia was home alone placing buckets strategically under holes in the roof. The house was originally made of brick, yet the mortar eroded and vines creeped their way inside like they did most places. A wooden roof was patched over with thatch and mud where it was still intact, and a musty smell had recently pervaded each room. Customers would ordinarily stop by to purchase candles to weather out the storm but it was well known that the Fitzotto stock of goods had been steadily dwindling, and now only the teensiest wells of low quality oil were left for sale. New goods should have been in a fortnight ago yet there had been no sign of return from Amelia’s uncle, and any calls to his usual suppliers in other towns to inquire about his whereabouts turned up fruitless. 
*He’s good-for-nothing,* she thought frustratedly as droplets plopped on her head. No doubt she was worried. He had extended his business trips before, but never like this. After her aunt’s death, his jaunts only became longer and longer, and now it seemed like he might never return. The house was in a state of massive disrepair which Amelia simply could not patch up without him, and she questioned whether it would stand the whole night. She had been subsisting on stale bread and tea for the last couple of days, and that was also beginning to run out. Other households had nothing to spare – they could barely keep themselves dry and fed. Her situation was growing bleak and there was little she could do aside from keep her ears tuned to the radio for any kind of distraction.
A draft blew through the living room as she placed a glass jar under the newest hole. Something had to be done.
```
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): 🏡  Stay inside to brace the house for the storm.
👱  Go outside to seek aid from the townsfolk.
🗺  Consider going to search for your uncle.
