Bill: 🌎 Throw the rock into the attic
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): **Part 3** 🙄
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Roused by curiosity, Amelia reached for the string that would open the attic doorway on the ceiling. She wasn’t short, but she was also not tall and it took a few jumping grasps until she finally caught hold and tugged the string down. She sidestepped right in time to avoid the rickety ladder as it slid to the ground. Frantic scratching now emanated from above, giving her a good idea as to what was causing such a racket. Amelia gripped the ladder and began to climb, paying special attention to the missing fifth step that always tripped her up.
 
The attic was musty and damp from rain. It was a triangular room with exposed beams and large branches twisting through the walls. Amelia had moved anything of her aunt’s that couldn’t be sold or traded up here, and those possessions occupied the corner closest to the ladder. A broken chair, a pile of tools, and boxes of winter clothes sat in other parts of the room, covered in cobwebs. *I should begin packing up the summerwear,* Amelia reasoned as she properly hoisted herself up into the room. *It will soon get chilly and those coats can be brought downstairs.*
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Her attention was drawn to the east end of the attic where a boot-sized chunk of the wall was missing. A colony of bats would regularly enter through this hole and spend the day lodging in the house, but they tended to be a quiet non-issue and Amelia always let them be. With them around, she no longer woke up to bity eight-legged surprises on her bedsheets too often. Along with some bats, this section of the attic now appeared to be occupied by a nest of squirrels. They had made themselves quite at home and must have been there for days given the size of their nest, a lumpy drey of dead leaves and grass and protective sticks that would prevent the bats from carelessly trespassing. Their presence was not too concerning, though her uncle wouldn’t be happy to discover an attic full of freeloaders on his return. 
 
Tiny eyes bored into Amelia. The bats were sleepy but kept awake by the riled-up squirrels, and now the appearance of their landlady only delayed sleep further. Even as Amelia entered the attic, the new furry flat mates scurried to and fro with no regards for the young lady. The reason for their agitation appeared to be a big nut-shaped object smuggled in from outside. Big for a squirrel, anyway. It was the size of a grapefruit and capped like an acorn. It was the color of sand, dotted with dirt and grass stains which covered up the fractal pattern spiraling around its outside. It was like no nut Amelia had ever seen.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): The squirrels were trying to crack this object open by knocking it off furniture and bouncing it against the floor, causing the ruckus. A single one of them was unable to pick it up alone. *How did they lug that up here?* Amelia wondered. She watched three of them cooperatively roll it up a wall, then let go and allow gravity take care of the rest. The object showed signs of cracking but did not break.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 🤷 : Leave and allow the squirrels to carry on. 
⛔ : Shoo the squirrels out of the attic.
🏈 : Help the squirrels break the object. 
💍  : Rescue the object before it is broken.

*Note: If you pick option 🏈 (break the object) or 💍 (save the object), you may also additionally vote ⛔ to shoo the squirrels out after the first course of action.*
