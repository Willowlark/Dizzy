N🆗ri (Marisa): **Part 27** 🛍 
Amelia loitered for a short bit to see if the nurses needed anything more, but they quickly forgot about her as they focused on work to be done. As she might only get in the way by staying, Amelia made her way back to the front of the hospital. "I'm going to step out for a bit," she told the receptionist, who smiled and nodded and told her "sure thing dear, he's in good hands now."

The stench of the city was strong outside. Two adolescents, a boy and a girl, stood a stone's throw away. They both had greasy black hair combed back neatly, and sing-song voices. "A penny for a posy! Perfect for ya' peach, they'll make her cheeks go rosy. Just a penny each!" sang the girl. The tune was excessively catchy and likely to stick in the heads of each man she walked up to, showing off a blue or pink bouquet of slightly wilted flowers in a big ribbon. The boy carried a basket of papers as big as he was and touted the signature "read-all abou' it!" paperboy cry. "Weather forecasts! Winter predictions! Giedion's new policies! Erry businessman needs to hear about this! Exclusive! Interview with the Bristol Brags! Need I say more?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): Amelia skirted the line of newspaper buyers and avoided eye contact with the girl to get to the street and just started walking. She didn't want to stray too far from the hospital on the chance she got lost. But it was rare for her to get out of Pillwood and this was quite exciting. The department store on the corner was a whopping eight stories tall! It loomed over the surrounding buildings, which were still of considerable heights. The first floor display window featured an array of soaps next to an intricate children's railroad set next to polished wooden walking canes next to a wool sweater collection. Any woman would recognize the work of the Square Sweater company. They were currently all the rage to combat the winter chill. Stylish, but pricey at a cost of $5 and up. Amelia gazed longingly at the sweaters for a few moments. She wanted the burgundy one with tiny reindeer.

The scent of something fried and delicious soon tore her away from the window. A large bald man was battering up sausages and expertly tossing them into a pool of boiling oil which hissed and sent drops of hot oil flying through the air. A loud crack caught everybody's attention as a hundred feet away somebody's wheel broke and their carriage tipped over. Nothing spilled except a string of expletives from the driver as he got out to push his cart out of the street. Next to the incident Amelia spotted a newly painted wall mural, spanning three connected buildings and detailing a stylized map of the whole city.
N🆗ri (Marisa): **TLDR; Amelia walks around and sees city life.**
