Total Nok-out (Marisa): **Part 4** 🏥 

Amelia rolled over and noticed fresh blood on her leg. She jumped up at the sight, uneager wash the bedsheets again if they happened to get stained.  Luckily the scrapes were not too deep. If someone asked, she could simply say “I fell,” instead of reliving the bizarre and embarrassing squirrel incident. *No one must find out about what happened today.* 

She hoped the cuts would heal quickly and moved into the connecting bathroom to splash water over them. Wounds were quite unbecoming on a girl of marriageable age after all. The water dripping from the ceiling finally came in handy and Amelia spent a considerable amount of time washing and drying each scratch over the bathtub. The government had begun warning citizens of something called a *virus* that could be transferred through blood, including the horrific wereplague which caused the inflicted to sprout animal appendages, go moon crazy, and reek something fierce. A friend of a friend of a friend caught it last year and Amelia had heard the wet dog smell was impossible to remove from the girl’s clothes even after being cured.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): There wasn’t enough clean gauze to cover everything, but Amelia made do with what was available. The mindless work was relaxing to her and a good way to pass the time, putting the storm out of her mind. As she put on a pair of thick stockings to cover up her patchwork legs, a deafening noise filled the air. Louder than thunder and certainly not caused by lightening. The bats in the attic screeched and the walls creaked under a heavy burden. Amelia gasped and ducked behind the bedpost, covering her head with both hands and relying on the old wooden post for support.

 A stray branch narrowly avoided Amelia’s head as a large tree fell upon the house, bringing the roof down with it. The recently-tidied floor was papered in leaves, twigs, dust, and crumbled wall. Much of the kitchen and front rooms were gone now. Wind from the impact swept up a cloud and sent debris flying to every corner. Amelia shook, stupefied at the scene. It took a few minutes for her to regain common sense, during which the storm outdoors now raged indoors as well. There wasn’t much of value in the house. Regardless, her uncle was not going to be happy.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): TLDR; cuts are clean, house is totaled by tree.
