Total Nok-out (Marisa): **Part 6** 😲
Total Nok-out (Marisa): “Thank you Minnie,” Amelia responded while shaking her head. Minnie disappeared into another room with a courtesy smile. Walter turned his back to the rest of the room and began shelling a bag of nuts, discarding the waste into the fire, a process it seemed he had been in the middle of doing before Amelia came by.

Visitors to Pillwood were pretty rare unless they were salesmen, so this guest piqued her interest. “A trader? Is he here to sell? What’s his deal?”

Doris smiled like a poker player certain of her victory. “Oho, don’t you worry dear he’s not gonna run you out of the market. Fur and leather, that’s his trade. Boy dresses like every day is church day. He’s returning from Chicago – can you believe it? – just finished up some big deal to wrap up his apprenticeship. He happened to pass through at the same time as this squall on his way home. Can’t hurt to help the boy. Speaking of, I take it your uncle…?”

“Not back yet. Not so much as a peep.”
Total Nok-out (Marisa): “Not a peep…? How unlike him, though he’s always been a flakey fellow. I’m sure he’ll show up any day now. Now, you on the other hand. Do you have money? Have you been eating well? I do so worry for a young thing like yourself living on her own.”

“Oh Missus Doris I’m perfectly fine,” Amelia laughed. It sounded a little forced as she was still wound up from the shock earlier. “This fellow you’re harboring, where is he from?”

“Oh! Yes, Judas. His name is Judas, how rude of me. I believe he’s from Bristol. The closer Bristol, to the West, not the dump up North. He’ll be heading back in the morning and… and… Oh, Lia, dear,” Doris used Amelia’s pet nickname that friends and family only used when trying to butter her up. “Why don’t you see if you can go with him? See if he can take you to the telecom center in the city? See if there’s a telegraph from your uncle or anyone who’s seen him recently. I hear that’s the place for missing persons reports in our region. What a fantastic idea. In fact, you know…”
Total Nok-out (Marisa): “Doris, wait just-“

Amelia rose from her chair at the same time Doris stood up. The motherly woman grabbed Amelia’s upper arm with the strength only an overly protective parent could use and draped a nice towel around her neck. “Enough of this gossip, I’ll introduce you two right now. Plus I should tell Abe you’re here, you know how he hates surprises. Let’s see.” 

Amelia was still partially soaked. Her hair was falling out of its ties and her eyes were puffy from stress. *She wants me to meet him in this state? Has she lost it?*
Total Nok-out (Marisa): TLDR; Girly gossip leads into a sudden introduction.

🛑  :Protest meeting until after freshening up.
😩  : ~~Un~~willingly go along with Doris’s scheme.
👋  : Call to Minnie/Walter for help.
