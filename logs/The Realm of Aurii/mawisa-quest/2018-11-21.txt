No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): **Part 18** 🚙
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "We can't stay here," Amelia proclaimed as she grabbed their possessions and started repacking. It was relatively simple work and only took mere minutes, but she was worried that every minute counted when a person was wounded. The griffon was none too pleased they were gearing up to leave. It let Amelia load their bags, but she was thoughtless in her haste and the griffon repeatedly nipped and squawked unhappily. 

Judas sat up and began to mutter "It's okay, I c-" but was quickly interrupted by Amelia grabbing his shoulder and hoisting him up. After putting out the campfire and plunging their surroundings into darkness Amelia sat herself in front of him, holding the reigns and willing the griffon to move, but it didn't budge. "We have to go, we can't stay here," she cooed while patting its head. No reaction. She floundered and nudged to no avail, desperation creeping into her actions.
"Give me the reigns," Judas said. 
"You can't even move your arm!"
"She's not going to listen to you."
Begrudgingly, Amelia handed over the griffon control rope. In the hands of someone more familiar, the griffon was more willing to move and they were on their way.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Within several minutes Judas was in too much pain to keep a grip on the reigns so Amelia took over, and the griffon luckily permitted this. Their progress was painstakingly slow, in part due to exhaustion and in part because they had to stay silent to hear the river. The griffon's eyesight was incredible so there were no worries about running into trees. But occasional shadows would peer at them from the dark and angry cries were carried from the river on the wind.

A little past dawn the river made a steep curve that they hadn't noticed, and when the sound of water faded entirely the gang had to backtrack. "Are we lost?" Amelia whispered to herself. Judas had fallen into a fitful sleep where he would mutter incomprehensibly. They were moving practically two miles an hour, at this rate they would never reach the city. Amelia decided to halt for a quick break.

She left Judas and the griffon alone to refresh herself for a few minutes and think about their predicament. She came back to a new surprise. A shirtless girl in a short mantle and baggy pants was attempting to woo their griffon, speaking softly and warmly as she crept closer while aiming an obsidian blade at Judas's throat. The girl had cropped black hair and tan skin covered with tattoos. She jumped at Amelia's sudden approach, turning the blade towards her and raising an arm defensively towards the griffon, as though Amelia was going to rush at and attack the creature.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): The mystery girl opened her mouth and a young-sounding voice emerged. "You better g--"
 She had been scrutinizing Amelia from head to toe and noticed Amelia's unusually pointy ears, which stopped her threat mid-sentence. "A fae?" She relaxed and withdrew her blade, turning back to Judas. "I mean you no harm. This settler is threatening our forest, I'm just going to get rid of him and free this captive." In a lower voice, she added "what a beauty you are" and patted the griffon on its beak. The girl pulled at Judas, trying to get him off the griffon's back to cleanly slice his throat.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): TLDR; the going gets tough and everyone is tired. A new person appears who is about to kill Judas, they would have killed Amelia too but mistook her for a spirit/faerie. 

(You can pick multiple of the following options as long as they make sense together (or suggest your own of course))
🔪 : Let the girl kill Judas
😮 : Tell the girl Judas is with you and you need him
👧 : Tell the girl you're not a fae, you're human
❕ : Command the girl to stop and ask why she's trying to kill Judas
🥊 : Wrestle the knife away from the girl
🌲 : Tell yourself you're going crazy and walk back into the forest
