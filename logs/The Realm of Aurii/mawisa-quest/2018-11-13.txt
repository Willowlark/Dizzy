No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): **Part 15** 🐟 

"Yeah. About that..." Amelia recounted the recent events while Judas listened intensely. He sat up straight and dug around in his bag.

"Are you alright?" he asked once Amelia had finished. "I can't believe-- why not tell me? What if it had followed you?"

"It probably won't," Amelia responded sheepishly. "It's content now, and it seems bound to the riverbank. I didn't want to alarm you before so I didn't say."

Judas took out a pistol. It was already loaded, though he double-checked to make sure. "Can you light me a torch? You've still got the lighter, right? I'm going to go find this thing and make sure it doesn't come looking for you again."
