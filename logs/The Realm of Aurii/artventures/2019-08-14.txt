Bill: I finished it!
Bill: It's like, three parts (C B and A support <:pew:543202259085950996> ), do I post them spaced out or just all at once.
Nokri (Marisa): How long is each part
Bill: short. Whole thing is 2.5k.
Nokri (Marisa): All at once then I think
Bill: feels kinda silly to make them separate chapter then actually.
Bill: Lysithea isn't in the FF.net character list.
Bill: for shame.
Bill: Ao3 is winning me over.
Bill: I need people to appreciate my ship. =T
Except the only people who know the golden deer route are people I barely know on Instagram and I‚Äôm not going to be like ‚Äúread my fanfic fam‚Äù

ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): BUTE
Aldus Larian (Jess): tfw u brain has 4 ways the next scene can go down and hasn't picked one
Aldus Larian (Jess): we pullin out the semicolons now fam. I'm almost 80% im using them correctly
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I shit you not, recruiters have called me back for things because I used a semicolon in my essay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): A STRONG SKILL
Bill: The power of fluff is strong apparently.
Bill: I think the one shot has gotten more favorites than AKA.
Bill: Bonus props to me for never implying if Byleth is M/F Byleth.
Bill: This is a strange review.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I didn't care about the story at all but I'm reading fan fiction
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): ?????
Bill: He didn‚Äôt. See the epilogue the fic is based on.
Bill: I mean good on him but.
Bill: Fics more popular than AKA tho. Overnight no less.
Aldus Larian (Jess): writing 2 or more characters of the same gender in a scene feels so odd sometimes because it just feels like you're repeating their names over and over again as to not do the whole "which he is he?" thing
