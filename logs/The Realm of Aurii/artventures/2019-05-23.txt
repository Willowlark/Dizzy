Nokri (Marisa): there are a lot of bugs on my bed and i am Terrified but also i found a song that reminded me of a senpai from the manga club and you can't ever go back on a promise made to a senpai i guess
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ahh bugs! ðŸ˜­
But the that drawing is super cute!
Bill: Thatâ€™s SO cute.
Bill: I love the watercolor look.
