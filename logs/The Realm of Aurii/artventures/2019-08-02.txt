El氣電e Faun (Tom): Ashe and my boss have pasta makers too
El氣電e Faun (Tom): I'd have to do some research for Japanese style ramen noodles
El氣電e Faun (Tom): So we can make
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Prob egg rice and wheat?
Nokri (Marisa): there's 4 main kinds of ramen and they all differ by the broth
miso, pork, salt, and soy sauce
El氣電e Faun (Tom): But the noodles are the same right
El氣電e Faun (Tom): And the ramen stands do usually make thier own?
Nokri (Marisa): ooo for the noodles you don't need eggs, ye they're the same
the stands might make their own? <:thinku:543194478614413318> it probably depends. more traditional ones definitely would, like at the beginning of the day and then freeze them, others might order refrigerated noodles in bulk
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Truuee
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Refrigerated noodles true
El氣電e Faun (Tom): We don't really have that available
Nokri (Marisa): yo forget drawing software, microsoft word is where it's at
