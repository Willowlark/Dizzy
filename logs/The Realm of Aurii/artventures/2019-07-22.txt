Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt get to work on it over the weekend tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good smut 汨
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Agreed with Bill. Sexy but not too explicitly graphic
Bill: You've got the like "I'm obviously talking about the dick here but I call it something flowery and indirect" language going on.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOO!
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i didnt wanna go too hardcore
Bill: Ye the flowery language is definitely what it is for a reason.
Bill: I can't imagine anyone sounds good writing 'he nailed that puss'.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea  i mean like sometimes people use dick or cock and honestly it sounds fine. as long as you dont use like "meat stick" or other cringe ass words for dick
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): None of the ||*"Saeyoung took his throbbing cock and shoved it into Mi-Cha's dripping pussy."|| kind of smut

Bill: Ye.
Aldus Larian (Jess): *tastefull*
Bill: Porn with emotions and passion, not a dick in a pizza box.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~oh no, but he'd so do that~~
Bill: but because it's him, not because he's a generic dick in a porno.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"She took his meat stick in her hand and brought it to her lips before putting it in her mouth. She took a bite, savoring the salty spiced flavor of the Slim Jim Saeyoung always brought for their post-sex snacks"*
Bill: oWO
