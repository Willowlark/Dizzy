Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Jisun was originally Jisoo but that's the lead singer of Blackpink lol~~
Bill: The flower note is cute.
Bill: You should put a flower in all the chapters that means something from the chapter.
Bill: That'd be super cute.
Aldus Larian (Jess): There will def be more references to flower meaning. Prob not every chapter but def more
Bill: Is good chapter.

Aldus Larian (Jess): Haha yeaaaa
Bill: I'm worried this chapter gets a little all over the place with snarky!Blake's personality but. If I go back and read it I know I'll hate it and stop so.
Bill: Yolo.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Nokri (Marisa): Yolo
Bill: Not because she's being snarky. Snarky works. Had to do the whole 'who is  Adam/Kilgrave'  discussion and I dunno if she's being bitchy ENOUGH.
