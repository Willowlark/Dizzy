Aldus Larian (Jess): i wrote only wrote 4 pages all weekend ðŸ˜­  which is better than none i was just hoping to get more done.
Bill: you did fine, can't always be productive.
Aldus Larian (Jess): multi chapter fics are hard D: but i re watched the secret endings for inspiration which worked cuz now i have more ideas
Aldus Larian (Jess): plus id still consider 4 pages productive, maybe not optimal but still productive
Bill: ~~I'm just trying to support you since you seemed bothered by it~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 4 pages is stil productive! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
