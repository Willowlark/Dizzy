Bill: Tis okay den. I’ve been on the fence over an Adam POV section like how Kilgrave gets screen time to establish his crimes, but I’m terribly uninspired with it (at this point) so I’m leaning Skip it and let the talk of him build the threat factor. Was asking to see if his threat factor comes through in the discussion OF him, versus seeing his acts.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Adam pov would kinda be coo? But he's gonna be more threatening through actions I think
Bill: Ye it’s just early for him to go batshit, and I think too early to have him communicating with Blake.
Bill: Part of me wants to go rewatch for inspiration, but I’m trying not to pull any more from Jones so that I get some originality into the story.
Bill: Adams proving the hardest person to write for.
