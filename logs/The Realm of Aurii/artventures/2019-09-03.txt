Aldus Larian (Jess): Chapter 5 is over 3000 words, im thinking maybe ill split it in two? my average chapter is 1500-1800 ish
Bill: A lot of my favorite fics started short but got longer as they kept writing. The authors notes always look like “oops I wrote a triple length chapter I just can’t help myself”
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea but also i wont feel the RUSH to write the next chapter cuz ill have one ready to go already lolol
Bill: oops am I supposed to feel the rush?
Bill: RIP Aka.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think I've gotta re write my outline. and i have alot to figure out for next chapter so having a chapter in the barrell would prob make it easier for me to feel less pressure
Aldus Larian (Jess): less self inflicted pressure lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): or maybe ill just post it all IDK im an indecisive mess
Bill: Nah, splitting it'll probably make you happier long run.
