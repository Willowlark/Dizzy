Aldus Larian (Jess): I would give this person my firstborn
Nokri (Marisa): "brynnakat, you are named after the best person i ever knew"
Aldus Larian (Jess): *is suddenly overcome with motivation*
Nokri (Marisa): You are filled with **Determination**.
Bill: inb4 I type Laguz at some point instead of Faunus.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo you can run a find and replace! i tend to spell the bois names wrond with Sea instead of Sae so i run that
Bill: Oh ye,  I mean like I don't notice.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye! so you run it just incase
Bill: I'd have to use regex though because it's overkill and I love it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): weird flex but ok
Bill: regex is what find and replace is.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i get that
Aldus Larian (Jess): i only use google docs so i just use what they have
Bill: *Sorry I just love regex it makes no sense without googling it and it's beautiful soup*
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea it just seemed like you were saying it was somewhat inconvenient to use cuz you said "id have to"
Bill: Oh lol nah, I *love* regex.
Bill: I'd have to as in I'd have to because I can't resist.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo yea but anyway you could use that to check for anything you might be worried about misspelling or something
Bill: ~~if I go back for spelling errors I'll have to read my own work and I'll psych myself out~~
Bill: `log = commands.Log(pattern='(log) ([^ ]*)')` All of Dizzy's commands are implemented via regex~
Aldus Larian (Jess): *Is it Cute, or Cringey?* a novel by me
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Cringe culture is toxic unless someone is legitimately making a fool outta themselves so you good
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~what if the character you're writing likes to make a fool out of themselves~~
Bill: Is there a name for dem short short jean shorts?
Bill: Them?
Aldus Larian (Jess): short-shorts
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk thats what i call um
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Jorts? Daisy dukes?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Short shorts ye
Bill: I thought daisy dukes too, but I think those are more slutty?
Bill: idk I don't fashion.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lowrise demin ultra short-shorts XD
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Micro shorts
Nokri (Marisa): those shorts are literally so short the pockets are sticking out, idk how daisy dukes would be any worse <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: fair.
Nokri (Marisa): women's pockets are way smaller than men's
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea shorts like that are pretty short ~~i have them~~
Bill: They cute!
Nokri (Marisa): help i'm lost i can't remember where the shorts discussion was
Nokri (Marisa): wait this is it
Nokri (Marisa): i found it but i'm still lost help
Aldus Larian (Jess): you've arrived! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): recalculating route
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "short shorts" would probably just be best, "cut offs" (if converted from jeans to shorts), "jorts" (if you *really* want to use the word "jorts" in your fic), Daisy Dukes (if Yang's going for an "ass out" kind of look)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "denim booty shorts"?
Bill: I just went with short denim shorts.
Bill: ~~I guess bees is happening because lol~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~because capitalizing on the fandom most popular ship is just good marketing <:lenny:395307171539189760>~~
Bill: I mean, spoilers Yang is the Luke stand in so...
Aldus Larian (Jess): and is good ship so
Bill: But they don't get together and I don't actually want to change that.
Bill: So I'm not advertising bees.
Aldus Larian (Jess): aww rip
Bill: But like. Blake's just drunk and admiring Yang's assets and I'm like 'well this is as gay as it gets'. (Blake being bi.) 

I dunno what's happening in this story anymore.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yang's *ass*ets? * wiggles eyebrows *
Kaio Vermino (Lee): üëÄ üêù
Kaio Vermino (Lee): "Ass-ets"
Aldus Larian (Jess): and boob-sets
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and vagina-sets
Bill: ~~you'll need to turn to Jess for your Bee smut needs~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~at least there would be one less leg to account for~~
~~one less arm too~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~when did one of them lose a leg?~~
Bill: ~~she means the dick~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): earlier in the week i made a terrible joke about how writting smut is hard cuz you have to figure out where 4 arms and ~~4~~ 5 legs are gonna go
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~oh~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): pretty bad i know XD
Nokri (Marisa): get one of those twister spinners. problem solved.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats how its done
Nokri (Marisa): "they kissed and she put... uh... she put..... her........"
spins wheel
"left...... hand. she put her left hand on"
spins wheel
"green."
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats how it works
Bill: Writing advice: "every scene should have purpose"
me: "this scene involved Blake going over her options for finding Adam, then getting distracted by Yang."
Bill: correction. *distracted* (<:lenny:395307171539189760>)
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats a purpose
Nokri (Marisa): I started writing a thing and keep getting distracted by future scenes and now I don‚Äôt know where I am
Aldus Larian (Jess): ass is life
Bill: Don't love it. Feel like Blake got drunk quickly and Yang manhandles her a bit too much. Blake's gotta have some bite back.
Bill: Idk.
Bill: But there's no need to narrate over how many drinks Blake had and her thoughts over that time.
Bill: so.
Nokri (Marisa): Why don‚Äôt you show Blake at an anti alcohol rally doing charity work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Blake looked up from her notes and saw Yang doing maintenance on her robotic arm. She never realized how cute Yang's stump arm was as she diligently lubed up all the joints.*
Nokri (Marisa): [whispers] don‚Äôt
Bill: No robo arm.
Nokri (Marisa): Just the stump
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): yall are killin me XD
Bill: ~~I'm low key disappointed actually, I like robot arm but Adam can't cut it off at Beacon in this story so~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): he can cut it off another way
Nokri (Marisa): Yang: ‚Äúyou wanna know how I lost this arm? you wanna know where the rest of it is?‚Äù
Blake: looks away embarrassedly
Aldus Larian (Jess): or she got it another way
Nokri (Marisa): Bike accident
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Blake wondered how it would feel if Yang used her stump to... Her face flushed before she could finish her thought.*
Nokri (Marisa): To mash potatoes
Bill: I don't know if any of you read the first two chapters, but since that was technically the last scene of the 3rd one I'll share it before posting. If everything with Yang feels weird, tell me once I get on the train. https://www.dropbox.com/s/amzvpd3xkr3t0l5/AKA%20From%20Shadows.rtf?dl=0 (this is all three chapters)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): exactly!
Nokri (Marisa): Blake was flushed because it‚Äôs warm and humid outside and the potatoes would expire quicker if they didn‚Äôt mash them soon
Aldus Larian (Jess): i read chap 1 haven't read 2 yet but im kinda jammin on my ~~smut~~ writing right now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~debates whether I should write Summer Lovin' smut~~
Nokri (Marisa): Don‚Äôt do it
Aldus Larian (Jess): DO IT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~oh wait, I need to write my Aurii post still~~
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs the spirit
Aldus Larian (Jess): *chuckles nervously*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||*Taiyang unzipped his pants revealing Xiao Schlong...*||
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO

Nokri (Marisa): Can‚Äôt believe Erik is banned wow
Nokri (Marisa): Wow
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||*Exasperated, Summer looked up at him saying "I swear to gods, Tai, if you call it that one more time..."*||
Nokri (Marisa): That better be a handwritten apology under there
Nokri (Marisa): To mr Obama himself
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||*"Taiyang Xiao Long? More like, Taiyang *how long* amirite?" Tai chuckled, congratulating himself on that pun.*||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||even better: How Tai runied his chance at a threesome||
Nokri (Marisa): I love church
Nokri (Marisa): And church things

Nokri (Marisa): Do churches do oneg after Friday night services
Nokri (Marisa): I love doing tzedaka at church
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||Okay, then change that to Raven saying that while Summer finds it cute. Raven get immediately turned off and walks out, picking up a vibrator on the way out||
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg yes

Bill: Ugh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: More about the Yang thing.
Bill: You being lewd is normal. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH lol
Bill: I know I'll hate it if I rad it myself.
Bill: So I guess I'll just troop on.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can read when I get home
Bill: If you want. That's not meant to be a like, PA request for someone to read it. I'm just lamenting how I am.
Bill: So long as the writing itself is fun right? If I start worrying about 'how do I make sure people like this' I'll burn out.
Aldus Larian (Jess): So like do you want me to read it and.make suggesteions or you just post and say fuck it
Bill: If you want to, I'd wait on posting that until you read it and gave me feedback, if any.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Okay should I skip 2 and go straight to 3? It might take me awhile of don't
Bill: No rush on my part, it's your choice.
Bill: whatever you'd be happier doing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh ok I was thinking you were looking to post asap
Bill: I mean, I would. But I won't die if I don't.
Bill: I wanna have the third chapter up by friday, technically.
Bill: Cause r/rwby does a fanfic friday thing and I'mma post on that.
Bill: Me: not confirming Bees

Aldus Larian (Jess): sometimes it be like that i spose
Bill: Ye.
Bill: Characters doing shit on their own.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ayyy thats how i got jisun at all! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oz is hogarth right?
Bill: Called it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): cant believe ozpin is cheating on his wife
Bill: ,... If I had ANY motivation to include Salem in this story, that would be a TRIP.
Aldus Larian (Jess): are u describing yang in outfit up yonder ^
Bill: Ye.
Bill: Slightly different than the image, but it just kinda happened to look the smae.
Aldus Larian (Jess): instead of hoodie id go with "open half jacket"
Bill: ye intentional difference.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hoodies dont usually include a boob view so it kind of feels like it cancels that clevage out
Bill: Oh, I should say zip up.
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe "low cut hoodie"?
Bill: I meant like an open zipper hoodie.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooo
Bill: Good catch.
Aldus Larian (Jess): *narrow eyes*
*is this a mystic messenger reference*
Bill: Not an intentional one.
Bill: Whatever you see.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hehe ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have a problem
Bill: is it the savior line?
Bill: I have no idea.
Aldus Larian (Jess): directly after the "With her blonde hair haloing her frame, it‚Äôs almost like
she‚Äôs a ray of sunshine."
Bill: || It‚Äôs been awhile since I was with a woman‚Ä¶ alright, with anyone, but that is a woman that can make anyone consider bending.  ||?
Aldus Larian (Jess): what about it?
Bill: is that the reference?
Bill: *I need to know*
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no no i emant it was the one i posted along with the savior line
Bill: Aaaah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): the savior line comes only a little after not directly after i was exageratiing lol
Bill: Yeah no then lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): but with the one u posted, do u mean bending like sexually or?
Bill: Like opposite of straight.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo
Bill: maybe could find a better way of sayin that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think it sounds like yang!
Aldus Larian (Jess): i only skimmed chapter 2 cuz i got alot stuff to try to get done tonight but i think yang is good
Bill: Mm. Blake not too OOC tho? I mean, snarky drunk Blake isn't in character but I feel like she went from snarker in chapter 1 to ball of panic in 2 and is now drunk and lovestruck in 3.
Aldus Larian (Jess): blake feels like jessica
Aldus Larian (Jess): i only skimmed chapter 2 tho
Bill: kk. Thank for that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): the parts about her being concerned for others feels like blake cuz i feel like that a big deal for her. im not super super into the rwby's characterizations but ya
Bill: Oh that good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): also its hard to imagine blake throwing down shots but thats for the crossover
Bill: She's Seen Some Shit ‚Ñ¢
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): ||late but, i once read a interview of a dude who lost his arm and how it affects sex||
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): ||he said: "They always think they want the stump... they dont want the stump...||
Bill: ~~I don't know why I assumed that would be on topic Tom always playing catch up lol~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO
Bill: Also oof.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ohhh noooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): ouch
Bill: me: should add authors notes
me: has nothing to say but
