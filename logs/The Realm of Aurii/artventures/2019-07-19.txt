Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok so
Writing smut is easier when I'm writing "couple that's been together a long time" rather than "couple that's doing it for the first time" but I will tell you it's still hard as fuck
Bill: *Well better hard than soft*

Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): || ~~would anyone be willing to read it for me when I'm done? It's ok if you're not because it's literal sex that I wrote and I understand that could be awkward~~ ||

Bill: ```The Queen of Jurassic Park - Invited to the world's preeminent theme park, Yang is tasked with aiding her uncle in his duties as game warden to better familiarize herself with the animals she will be working with upon graduation. Her sister Ruby tags along unable to resist seeing the newest attractions, but the new stewardess of the island has little patience for them or any unfortunate mishaps as she rebuilds the once great kingdom. (RWBY x Jurassic Park AU)``` what
Bill: https://old.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/cfcgfu/fan_fiction_friday_july_19_2019_what_have_you/eu8ya5k/ Reddit does a fanfic friday thread, I posted AKA From Shadows on it.
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo
I thought it was that, but the other time you posted it was a direct link so I only saw the one comment
Bill: Could go well. Or poorly.
Bill: But what the hell.
Bill: Now I'm going to spent the next 24 hours anxiously wondering about responses on that thread/story rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats the fun part!
