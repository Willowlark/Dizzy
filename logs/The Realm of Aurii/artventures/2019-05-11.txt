Aldus Larian (Jess): I took a break and came back and its just deacon
Elfriede Faun (Tom): DEACON!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): i forgot about him
Bill: Oh that looks good Jess.
Bill: Wow you both improving so fast.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh hold on I'll get you the update that is no longer deacon
Aldus Larian (Jess): Its still sketchy and it needs more work esspecially the hair but
Bill: IT Seven.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA his hand is still bit it's good and I don't wanna erase it to try to make it bigger lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHH I wanna work on my drawing but I'm gonna be out all day ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): draw on faces
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@!301927856240459777> have you ever used clip studio paint?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!! that's my main program now. it's neat
Elfriede Faun (Tom): it came with the tablet and it says: "FOR ANIME AND MANGA DRAWING"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): unsure if i wanna continue with photoshop or try out that one
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ill install it at least
Nokri (Marisa): it has a nice correction feature that i still have to figure out how to fully use, and it has a nifty coloring thing where it colors in everything even if the lines aren't perfectly shut
Nokri (Marisa): WOAH THAT'S SUCH A DEAL
Nokri (Marisa): i much prefer it for drawing over photoshop but they both have unique stuff
Nokri (Marisa): ~~also because i can't get pen pressure to work in photoshop~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yo same tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): photoshop a butt with penpressure sometimes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ill try out both
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): autodesk sketchbook is pretty lit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pen pressure always works, and you can download free brushes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and they have free tutorials
Nokri (Marisa): if you like copics they have a really nice autodesk copic edition i think for free too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): is that a free program?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea its all free now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i used to pay for it cause i liked it so much
Elfriede Faun (Tom): neeto!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but they recently made it free for everyone
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): -----------------------
Elfriede Faun (Tom): sorry im cleaning my keyboard
Elfriede Faun (Tom): and absolutely everything is falling out
Nokri (Marisa): ---------------------------------
Nokri (Marisa): bam now you're in jail
Elfriede Faun (Tom): shit
Nokri (Marisa): how much lost money is in your keyboard
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its a really clean interface too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): am bad at anime pls no judge xD
Nokri (Marisa): **it's so amazing though**
Elfriede Faun (Tom): im judging and its amazing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): jfhsdja oh thank you ðŸ˜­
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but uh.... yea the copic marker brushes are pretty great
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ooo so
Elfriede Faun (Tom): whats copic mean
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you know those really expensive markers that comic artists and manga artist use?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they like are good for blending and getting a solid color
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and are like 5 dollars per marker
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ive never seen those in my life lmao xD how did i manage go to school for art and miss that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): one kid in our class actually might have used that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they were like the Weebâ„¢ marker
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): anyone who drew manga splurged
Nokri (Marisa): they're like, the only kind of marker you can find in the art section of anime stores in japan
and in regular art stores there were always manga supplies right next to the copic section
Elfriede Faun (Tom): they look dope not gonna lie
Nokri (Marisa): they're so nice
Elfriede Faun (Tom): are they basically just skinny tipped high pigment markers?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theyre alcohol based i think and they draw like this:
Nokri (Marisa): only like $1.50 apiece in japan, i stocked up

they have varying nib sizes, and you can 'layer' the color by drawing over the same spot with the same marker. it's kind of like watercolor painting with markers?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Nokri (Marisa): *did you draw that*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no , i wish
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i havent drawn since highschool ngl
Elfriede Faun (Tom): really neet!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): aside from this rwby thing
Nokri (Marisa): any colored akatsuki no yona art is always done in copics (and on rare occasion watercolor, but kusanagi says she usually draws with copic)
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....and some portraits
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ye jess said she wanted water color markers too
Bill: I used to have a dozen or so Copics.
Bill: I thought having good gear could help me improve.
Bill: I gave them to Katy years ago.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yeahh... same tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ALTHOUGH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): having the different boldness of pencils has ben very very nice
Elfriede Faun (Tom): that way i can sketch and detail wont be lost
Elfriede Faun (Tom): and i can accuratly shade things with the light pencil and not worry about drawing heavy lines
Bill: Glad you were able to make use of them.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~im a liar, i realized ive drawn quite a bit... just not nearly as much as during school. woops~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :3
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yeah i didnt even know you drew
Elfriede Faun (Tom): i dont think youve mentioned it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont really draw anime much
Elfriede Faun (Tom): also i watched some videos of the copic markers, i suppose they are light and blend really nicely
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i tend to do like realistic stuff. or like SUPER sketchy stuff
Bill: Fred used to sell them through his store.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That is, Ofc, fine! Real stuff is just as valid
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i draw like once in a blue moon, which is a drastic difference from being in com arts and drawing daily
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yeeee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): also pali wouldve got his woopin stick out if he caught anyone drawing too much anime
Nokri (Marisa): you only draw realistic stuff? so like, the girls chests are only 1/3 the size of their body?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA HE WOULD LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he HATED anime
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea fam, girls chests are normal size
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its weird
Elfriede Faun (Tom): this one girl uhhh i forget her name
drew a picture of herself in her underwear and pali refused to look at it but he said nothing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WHY WOULD SHE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sdajkfhslda
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fucking yikes

Elfriede Faun (Tom): so a FRESHMAN
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Pali's like i stg i dont want a half naked 15y.o. up in here
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

Elfriede Faun (Tom): anyways im pretty sure that girl ended up leaving tech
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): uh.. probably for the best
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yeeeeeaa
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Pali also called me either: Tommyboy or Jess's Ex name
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *dabs*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh NOOOOOO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im so sorry xD pali was.... something
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NAHH I FORGIVE HIM WHO COULD HATE PALI
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He was something ofc
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he was kinda like a himbo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): a little bit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but we loved him
Bill: He got the anime club off the ground... I didn't know Vantresco and we needed someone to take the bullet from staff.
Bill: If I hadn't gotten the backing the first year I tried to make it work, it never would have made it to the next year.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea that was hilarious ngl because pali hated anime so much
Bill: Always will like him for that.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): IKR
Elfriede Faun (Tom): i cant believe he agreed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we were all like "PALI IS DOING WHAT NOW???? HE YELLED AT ME FOR MY EYES BEING TOO ANIME IN THIS DRAWING???"
Bill: I couldn't tell you how I convinced him.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): did you bribe him
Bill: Alpha Leo powers.
Nokri (Marisa): if you crush something it will grow back stronger. he was watchin' his own back.
Nokri (Marisa): controlled it before it became a monster
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I always said
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Miyazaki is Asian Pali
Elfriede Faun (Tom): and vice versa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMFAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its true
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Pali: Anime was a mistake
Bill: Ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh same
Bill: Shame the club fell apart when I left.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): oo the color transferring thing from mark to marker is cool with the copic markers
Bill: We were the single largest student organization in my last year.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fun fact: my smol group of friends talked about joining all the time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): while you were running it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but we never did bc the weird kids who wore tails were in it
Bill: Understandable, you then saw me talking and ran <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Bill: yeee Leneah and Cait.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMaO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): i saw leneah at my sisters graduation but she wouldnt even look at me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we looking into the room and saw their tails and were like "mmmm better not"
Bill: Yeah idk what was up with Leneah.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): her name was entirely too close to mine
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and the office would get us mixed up
Nokri (Marisa): tails
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): leneah millar, leanna malure
Bill: fun fact, right around graduation I realized I had a crush on her. Tried to keep in touch during freshman year, which was terribly unsuccessful and she started ghosting me.
Bill: Last time I saw her she was working at Byram Mcdonalds.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): She might dislike me cuz i didnt understand that Cait was trans and i said something about not understanding
Nokri (Marisa): tail girl? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): leneah is trans too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): also they were fighting at the time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but idk what their name is now
Elfriede Faun (Tom): she wasnt yet tho
Bill: ~~the entire anime club was~~
Bill: or will be.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lgbt tend to gather together
Nokri (Marisa): we'll finally get magical girl biru
Bill: There's a serious overlap between lgbtq and anime.
Bill: even outside of cons.
Nokri (Marisa): because anime is traditionally an 'outsider' hobby, but it's also a very expressive subculture with many creative outlets
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Bill: *Wow that sounds so wise, like you're a sociologist or something* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Ye.
Bill: I mean, I'm only stating the fact. That wasn't meant to be an opinion on it.
Bill: In HS I had no idea though.
Bill: Dense as fuck.
Bill: I still have a few things Leneah drew.
