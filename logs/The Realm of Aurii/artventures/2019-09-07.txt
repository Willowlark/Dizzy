Aldus Larian (Jess): I owe Brynnakat my life.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~which one of you is posing as Brynnakat?~~
Bill: ~~I’m so glad I’m not the only person who assumes that, I did about the the reviewer yesterday~~
Bill: Not I. I haven’t even kudos’d your works.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah I see this person comment on alot of fics in the MM fandom so unless one of you is going real hard to try to put up the front I think they're legit
Bill: It’s not a logical thing, it’s a “there’s no way what I wrote is liked this much by a stranger, I need a different answer” thing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye lol I got another comment that was just hearts but it still made me feel good <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: Woo!
