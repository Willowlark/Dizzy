Bill: Woo posting without reading!
Bill: ~~if you happen to read it and it really bad tell me~~
Bill: I'm a thousand words from the minimum length story I would read.
Bill: I usually filter out things under 10k.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im only at 3,900 lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): but it takes time to build a word count for me i reread everything like 6 times lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~its alot easier to write when you're ripping content from 2 things at once~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): *screams*
Aldus Larian (Jess): he only started writing when i did ahjefanofjn
Bill: That fine, i'm just weird about criteria for fics. I should reread but I know I'll stop writing if I go back and check it.
Bill: ðŸ˜…
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ill get it over 10 itll just take more chapters
Bill: I just realized my ao3 username is different than my fanfic user name.
Bill: and willowlark is taken on fanfic.
Aldus Larian (Jess): an imposter
Bill: *Ao3 only allowed _ as special character and FF allows . and - so I can't even use special characters to make them match fuck*
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo and remember to tag any ships if youll have any unless is secret
Bill: I dunno if I wanna get into shipping so haven't put it down.
Bill: Will do though.
Bill: I can use pawkun on Ao3 but *that's my old screenname and I dun't wanna use ittttt*
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe pick a newname for both?
Bill: I could do. will*0*lark.
Bill: bleh tho.
Bill: Oof new name.
Bill: It took a decade to move off of Pawkun.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah it kay just have more than one user name
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have like 3 parts tot he next chapter started but my brain keeps jumping around
Bill: ðŸ˜­
Aldus Larian (Jess): some of this probably should have been in the last chapter now that im thinking about it but
Bill: Meh as long as you're having fun.
Bill: ~~which is why I won't read back~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like to write it and then leave it and then read it again and be like "i wish there was more" "wish this person would make more"
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then im like fuck thats meeee
Bill: I'm worried I'd judge myself into oblivion. XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i think i want some smut next chapter but like light smut~~
Bill: Jess: I want more
Other Jess: more of what
Jess & other Jess: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~smut is hard to write tho~~
Bill: It's just like the brush thing. Take inspiration from real life. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill just bull the fade to black
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean ~~i do~~ but its still hard even with that
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like ok you got 2 heads and 4 arms and ~~5~~ 4 legs to keep track of
Bill: Less is more.
Nokri (Marisa): charmin ultra
Bill: You only need to describe the focus. Let the reader's imagination fill in the rest.
Bill: I don't read smut tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean I *do* its not like a "move right arm to green circle"
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): the focus tends to change alot
Bill: So follow that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i do
Aldus Larian (Jess): its just still alot lol
Bill: It might be harder with the third person perspective too. <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have 4 pages of one written (standalone)
Aldus Larian (Jess): that ones third the and then the other is second person(cuz thats a big mm fandom thing) and that ones 6 whoops
Aldus Larian (Jess): but its not all smut theres other stuff in there too
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): its not like pure smut theres allot of feelies in there too
Bill: I'm only teasing.
Bill: Write that smut.
Bill: I ship it.
Bill: ,... Yeah, I mean. Even more than V and MC. I like the V/MC thing but.
Bill: More for the storyline than the ship.
Aldus Larian (Jess): jess/smut ship of the year
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~im assuming you mean MC/seven tho~~
Bill: Oh yeah.
Bill: Sorry that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whooo
Bill: I gotta get in Adam's head before I continue.
Bill: weeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): come back safe
Bill: Eh, it'll be fine.
Bill: He's fairly simple, the trick is figuring out what his next move is.
Bill: ~~I basically wrote out aspects for him and Blake and that's been really helpful~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have an idea of where this fic is going (at least I thought I did) but I have no idea how it's gonna get there and both chapter 2 and now 3 have completely come out of no where. So basically it has a mind of it own so hopefully it doesn't crash and burn <:rise:582318089228648456>
Bill: That's a huge fucking mood.
Bill: 3 more Kudos and a *review*
Bill: > I want comments like Jess got
> we have comments like Jess got at home
> comments at home:
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is a review different than a comment? <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> I don't understand fanfic . net lol
Bill: me either, I thought reviews were like comments but it's more like a story specific DM I think.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh that sounds terrifying
Aldus Larian (Jess): what was the word supposed to be? cacoon?
Bill: Cancun.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooo y people gotta be like dat
Aldus Larian (Jess): i read a fic that mispelled saeran as satan and i didnt correct the person
Bill: I mean, lol, w/e.
Bill: It means someone actually read it.
Bill: That's something.
Aldus Larian (Jess): tru!
Bill: Now to focus on work for a change of pace.
