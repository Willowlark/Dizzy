Bill: I have been playing with the idea of a Rwby Jessica Jones crossover and had some really good concept ideas. Blake is Jessica, Adam has Kilgrave's powers as his semblance and that's the divergence that brings RWBY canon to the Jessica Jones setup of Blake is a PI and Adam is her kryptonite.

I need to motivate myself to try writing it but I'm not much of a writer and that's intimidating.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo that would be neat
