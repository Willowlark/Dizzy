Nokri (Marisa): the hate begins!!!
Nokri (Marisa): there's a big fight in the invader zim fandom right now
Aldus Larian (Jess): about what D:
Nokri (Marisa): i didn't think it'd happen this quickly lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait legit???
Nokri (Marisa): yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTF ughhh 😭
Nokri (Marisa): <:pew:543202259085950996>
~~do you guys think it's weird?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): it doesnt even scream ship art though
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!
Nokri (Marisa): i don't even ship them romantically
Aldus Larian (Jess): its more of like threatening then ship
Nokri (Marisa): i ship them but as frenemies
the creators of the show also posted a video of puppets of zim and dib making out so what does that say
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes, because good ships involve threatening someone with a knife <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): i think it's mainly one tiny group policing the tags
this happens in literally every single fandom
Nokri (Marisa): im tryna find the puppets
maybe i'll join the zadr discord just to spite them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/ghostbustersmovies-ghostbusters-original-xT8qBmNrpCOTWvkQi4
Nokri (Marisa): oh here it is
the voice of zim and the show's original creator making out with puppets
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea it really does though, its super annoying
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone def tag crawling
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone who needs something better to do
Nokri (Marisa): zim gouges out a kid's eyes and steals multiple people's organs, including dib's brain, in the tv show. but my art is questionable <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO srsly
Nokri (Marisa): the main argument they make is that it's pedophilia, maybe it's not obvious but i tried to age dib up?
anyway here's the discourse tag for any interested parties
https://www.tumblr.com/search/zadr+discourse
Aldus Larian (Jess): these same people prob read twilight and had a grand old time
Nokri (Marisa): i think user awful-invader-zim-ideas is the one behind most of the messages
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao wtfff
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ignore that degenerate
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's because they have awful invader zim ideas
Nokri (Marisa): i think i'm mostly upset because i don't want to be labelled a pedophile and i figured no one would say that based on what i drew. is it too lewd? i honestly have no idea, everything relating to sex is absolutely repulsive to me. I am gonna ignore it on tumblr but I don't want it to blow out of proportion and get me banned or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): its not lewd at all!
Nokri (Marisa): this person knows where it's at with their big bold letters <:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nahh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And even if it was which it isnt it doesn't matter cuz he's aged up
Aldus Larian (Jess): its. not. even. ship. art.
Nokri (Marisa): it was nice knowing you guys, can't wait until i'm banned from the internet. could happen any moment now
Aldus Larian (Jess): NAH ignore them
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean id prob freak out too
Aldus Larian (Jess): but that doesnt mean you should!
Nokri (Marisa): no no
this is a sign
we're really back to 10+ years ago, these are the giant tumblr shipping wars all over again
Nokri (Marisa): the discord link is gone, i think the drama probably spread to there since it was a public link
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHH
Aldus Larian (Jess): tumblr plz
Nokri (Marisa): my blood has been stolen, the hats are complete, and i'm all out of fabric for hairpieces for the day, next is the pokemon pillows but there isn't a sewing machine set up so those'll be made tomorrow

so what should i draw before my tumblr gets deactivated <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): it not gonna get deactiviated!
Nokri (Marisa): u right it's gonna get banned my bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): NUUUUU
Nokri (Marisa): i've have to start my life over on one of my many alternate accounts that've been gathering dust one the 10 or so accounts on here go
Nokri (Marisa): 11
Nokri (Marisa): i have 11 accounts on my main tumblr <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): :O!
Nokri (Marisa): most of them are canon artemis fowl accounts in anticipation of the movie womp womp

Aldus Larian (Jess): like urls?
Nokri (Marisa): ye!
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa!
Nokri (Marisa): i think bias tape and box pleats were ideas i had when i was considering changing kasei cosplay but then just. didn't. eyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just put all my garbage on one blog and call it a day
Nokri (Marisa): i know i have at least one other account that was for hunting down art thieves, but it was on another email
Nokri (Marisa): because that account caused drama
Nokri (Marisa): the only other url i really used was animeauthority and that's been dead for a couple of years, but it still gets asks! about once a month someone will come asking for help identifying a show or finding an old manga and i'll help them
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh thats really cool!
