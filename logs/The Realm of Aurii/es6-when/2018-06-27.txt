Bill: 10 bucks, figured it'd be like wildlands but with less open space.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: This isn't link lol

Aldus (Jess): oh yea it exists
Elfriede (Tom): Oh yeah plenty of zelda
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): 
Bill: God I want a Zelda centric story.
Bill: I'd pay bank.
Bill: Fanfic even, they don't even have good Zelda as the lead *fanfic*.
Nokri (Marisa): in the future i'm going to make dolls of the different races kids. before i left i gathered a ton of references and made patterns that still need a lot of tweaking, but i was gonna sell them at an artist alley at some point in attempt to make bank. probably won't sell as well now that botw hype is calming down but will still be a fun project
rito, goron, gerudo, and zora child plushies
Nokri (Marisa): i wanted to make them lifesize like my pokemon but bojo would kill me
Nokri (Marisa): tagged: prince sidon
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): does anyone watch the Game Grumps
Nokri (Marisa): an excellent moment is the last minute or so of this zelda episode
https://youtu.be/4GQXoNvRL8w?t=656
Bill: 
Bill: and for Georgia specifically,
Bill: 
Bill: ~~Though it's weird without the beard~~
Bill: 
Elfriede (Tom): Who is this man and why is he everywhere ❤
Afina (Georgia🍀): MY GIRL
Bill: Star Guardian is still kinda Madoka, but regular Lux is nice.
Aldus (Jess): wait
Aldus (Jess): what man?
Bill: probably Fish guy.
Aldus (Jess): OH NVM i get it
Bill: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/06/26-1/the-world-ends-with-you-final-remix-dated-for-switch-in-japan I CAN'T WAIT~ ❤
Bill: I wonder if it'll get cosplay activity. It was a really underground game, but it's such quality.
Bill: Is pokemon go hard core coming back? <@!317526103591747585> <@!184440044822462464>
Elfriede (Tom): I was thinking of picking it up myself again too
Bill: My account got deleted tho.
Bill: yup. I'd have to start from scratch.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I think me too
Bill: The AR sucks less.
Bill: https://store.steampowered.com/app/410320/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_41_The_Shadow_of_New_Despair/ It's still 20 bucks, but I still kinda wanna play this.
Bill: it's like, campy ridiculous murder fest. Gotcha force graphics and just... memes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Back 2 Nier
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also yesterday lily said a legitimate strategy when fighting the escaped yorha androids was to make 9S just a ~~human~~ android shield
Afina (Georgia🍀): And accidentally said "like a meatSNACK" instead of meatSACK
Afina (Georgia🍀): And lily was like, you right, he's cute AND he shields you from swords he's a meat SNACK
Afina (Georgia🍀): moral of the story, everyone find you a nice meatsnack
Aldus (Jess): What did you say? 9s is a snack?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean lily said it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Not me
Afina (Georgia🍀): I meant to say that he was a human shield but accidentally called him a snack
Afina (Georgia🍀): So now he's both
Bill: lewd.
Bill: probs.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like Nier isn't great at keeping all the missions in one place
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like all the stuff I have to "do" isn't necessarily listed on the quests tab
Afina (Georgia🍀): And the map is confusing to read to find objectives
Bill: There's alot of missions in the field too.
Bill: you find karate bot yet?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah
Bill: He awesome.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _9S has been lost_
Bill: ooooh, after freaky fish guy.
Elfriede (Tom): yeeee
Elfriede (Tom): *wonder where he could be*
Bill: > Jess slamming closet door
> "I, uh, have no idea"
Aldus (Jess): No one keeps 9s in the closet
Afina (Georgia🍀): Now playing just seems a _little_ bit lonelier
Afina (Georgia🍀): HUH
Aldus (Jess): OH YEA
Aldus (Jess): Yeeeeeee
Elfriede (Tom): 💔
Bill: *It's symbolllic~*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Symbolic?
Bill: reference a persona 4 meme, but everything is symbolic in that game.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i am in a white world omg_
Bill: ooooh, the copied city is awesome!
Afina (Georgia🍀): ITS DAT BOI AGAIN
Aldus (Jess): adam?

Bill: Adam is glorious.
Aldus (Jess): he so fucking pretty though
Aldus (Jess): i mean thats the only thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lily: Amen to that
Aldus (Jess): to him being hot?
Bill: Has Lily been watching you play the whole time?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye
