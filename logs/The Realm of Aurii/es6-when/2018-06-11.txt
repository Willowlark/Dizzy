Aldus (Jess): Good name billy
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: ‚ù§
Bill: I'm honoring your salt.
Bill: It is worthy.
Aldus (Jess): Friendship with Bethesda has ended Cheritz is my new best friend
Nokri (Marisa): cheritz at e3 when
Bill: Cheritz: Mystic Messenger for Alexa.
Aldus (Jess): Like I am feeling 1/10 on the hype scale
Bill: I'm like, 5ish.
Aldus (Jess): ~~mystic messenger 2 when?~~
Bill: Maybe 4. Entirely for 76, and i'm tentative.
Bill: We don't really know much.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): fallout is such a love of mine i feel like im being messed with
Nokri (Marisa): *worldwide ssum release when*
Aldus (Jess): Like... They told us nothing about what 76 is actually about
Bill: Just multiplayer.
Aldus (Jess): Like we are building stuff? Whoo?
Bill: I won't hate it for multiplayer, I'll hate it for being minecraft.
Aldus (Jess): ~~i will~~
Bill: I need some story, or NPC factions that do stuff.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I'm like 3 to 7 for fallout 76
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Like all over the fucking place
Aldus (Jess): Yea true
Bill: I need details.
Aldus (Jess): Ok I'm 1-3
Bill: too early to call it anything.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: ES6 I'm glad for but not hype yet obv
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Space Skyrim sounds cool
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): yeah tom i feel that
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): im all over like 4-8 too
Bill: ***ES6 available on N64***
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Plz
Aldus (Jess): I'm more excited for the hope of starfield/es6 then 76
Bill: ~~you'll still play it tho~~
Aldus (Jess): It's like post apocalyptic destiny
Aldus (Jess): With building
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Like.. I'll prob get fallout 76 on PC and play with Kurtis, Jared and Dave... Let's be honest... And then it'll die out like pubg..
Bill: üëÜ
Bill: ~~Also fuck you I wanna play~~
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): /sits on ps4
Aldus (Jess): He didn't include me either
Bill: you aren't excited for it.
Aldus (Jess): Yea but I wanna be included too
Bill: and FOMO will get Jess playing.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Prob will wait for it's release and judge the public
Bill: Ye, going to suck for Georgia unless crossplay, which modern games *should* have.
Aldus (Jess): RIP the days of sharing game library
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Yeah it should...
Bill: get a PC Georgia, seriously.
Aldus (Jess): Idk I need to know more, but yea it's not piquing my interest
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: It's not gonna happen dude
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Like... I *would* get it on ps4
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: But that give Jess no hope of ever playing with me
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Cuz obv we don't have 2 consoles
Bill: I was think that.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): _console rules_
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Otherwise I would
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): it ok
Eliran (Halim): bae get a pcccc
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): ill play alone **like a bethesda game should be**
Bill: when's Last of Us 2 come out, cause that's when I buy a ps4.
Aldus (Jess): "console rules" says the grill that can't play with anyone
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: How the fuck are you supposed to play alone tho like
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Yeah I'mma lower my hype
Bill: too bad my old box was basically dead.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Like a 4 or 5
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): i dun have monie for compooter
Eliran (Halim): i mean it doesn't sound like its meant to be an mmo tho
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Pvp shooter reskinned with fallout
Aldus (Jess): I'm leaving in 20 mins to drive to Todd Howard's house and make him change this shit who's coming?
Nokri (Marisa): tell him i said hi
Bill: It's not an MMO. If it's PvP fuck it. If it's coop questing with all the flavor I love of fallout, hype.
Bill: Like, Borderlands but more open world survival.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): ^^^^^
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Fallout 76 doesn't even feel canon
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Which is the worst part
Aldus (Jess): The fans wont take it seriously...
Bill: Yeeeaaaah, especially if they do events and stuff. Like, what if the players support the brotherhood in something and the brotherhood nukes DC? Whoops fallout 3 not canon.
Aldus (Jess): Alot of them don't take 4 seriously allready
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Can't wait to see this Facebook fallout group shit storm üëÄ
Bill: I'll have to catch up in the morning. I'm up way too late.
Bill: tomorrow going to be *hell*.
Nokri (Marisa): it's only noon <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Bioware: we ruined our series worse than anyone!
Bethesda: hold my beer
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): if they just took out the online aspect i would be happy
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): i like the premise of being a "prequel", i like new mutants, ill even take the new building mechanic
Bill: ~~because you wouldn't have FOMO~~
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): u shut ur face
Bill: üòõ
Bill: I love new enemies.
Aldus (Jess): I agree
Bill: I'd be fine with more faction wars too. Really have the world shift and change.
Bill: since you can nuke the fucking place.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): yeah like more violence
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): yeah i like the missiles
Aldus (Jess): New enemies look cool, wv lore is cool, gov secrets are cool online is shit
Eliran (Halim): ~~I like the way fallout 76 looks and was excited about it~~
Bill: Depends on the type of online, and the way they express the lore.
Aldus (Jess): I like the way it looks
Bill: Like I'm not game with fetch quest the game.
Aldus (Jess): But I have no interest in another online game meant to be played with other people from a series built on single oalyer immersion
Aldus (Jess): That's just the kind of game I like personaly, I hate pvp
Bill: oh FUCK PvP.
Bill: it can be an option, sure, but if it's a required component I'm out.
Eliran (Halim): I doubt PVP is gonna be the primary thing
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): it better not
Eliran (Halim): it looks much more co-op and PVE
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): i like the series for its immersion too
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Hal have you played other fallouts?
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): >w>
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: *specifically3andNV*
Eliran (Halim): not extensively 
Haven't had the time or money to put into a game like that
Eliran (Halim): plus
Eliran (Halim): find a good mmorpg and you get a game thats just as immersive and fleshed out
Tho they don't have many good shooter ones
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): yaaa
Eliran (Halim): i much prefer fantasy as a genre anyways ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Eliran (Halim): whenever es6 comes out i'm ready
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): true
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): 20 years from now lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I'm walking away from this experience more confused then when I walked it
Aldus (Jess): Oh yea me too got fantasy
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I really like fantasy, but the video game I got the most immersed it was 300percent NV
Nokri (Marisa): rune factory 5 when
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: YEAH BETHESDA
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: WHEN YOU GONNA RELEASE STARDEW VALLEY 5
Nokri (Marisa): *hisses*

Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: How dare
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): **excuse me** ***what***

Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I completely beat disgaea 1 and 2
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Never got to play any others
Nokri (Marisa): bravely default's opening was strange, the game came with a card you had to scan on the 3d camera to see a prologue or something

Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I wanted to play that
