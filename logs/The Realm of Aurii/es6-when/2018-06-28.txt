Elfriede (Tom): 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): I found the robot cult of the abandoned factory
Afina (Georgia🍀): The robot cult reminds me eraia
Aldus (Jess): Lmfao
Bill: Become as gods.
Elfriede (Tom): remind you of Eraia lmaoo wutttt
Afina (Georgia🍀): Because they're all freaky religious people
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmm spider thing in the factory killed me
Bill: You must not carry enough heals.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I doooo they just gank me so quick that it wipes all my health
Afina (Georgia🍀): What's the diff between retrieve and repair
Afina (Georgia🍀): MMMM THIRD DEATH
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why is this one spider thing so hard
Afina (Georgia🍀): FOURTH
Afina (Georgia🍀): omggg
Afina (Georgia🍀): My hand actually hurts I'm callin it for now lol
Bill: Maybe you need to do some more side quests.
Bill: There’s a bit of level grind aspect.
Afina (Georgia🍀): That may be it 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): It feels like I'm more late game than early game too
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm level like 22
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I'm taking a break for now
Bill: You’re moving through really fast iirc.
Bill: I’m surprised.
Bill: Spider thing is close to late game too.
Bill: Go see if you can get overclock somewhere. Overclock slows everything down when you dodge an attack, except you.
Bill: If you have like +3, you can pretty perpetually keep the enemies slowed.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Damn
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's sweet
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm like way deep in a factory tho I don't think I can leave
Bill: I... don’t know actually.
Bill: Try fast travel.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah it won't let me
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also justin is playing and he's also liking it
Afina (Georgia🍀): _he said he has the cosplay feelies_
Bill: Guess you’ll have to fuck him up at level 22.
Bill: But for who is the question.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah once my dang hand stops hurting
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's pretty obvious I'm more videogames than anime fan at this point huh 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which, nothing wrong with that, but Idk what anime I last watched before Yona
Nokri (Marisa): are u ok
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i play videogames marisa_

Afina (Georgia🍀): it's all over kids, georgia is cosplaying Nier
Nokri (Marisa): oh, you're a gamer, huh? name 10 different songs they've released
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ur a fake gamer Marisa how bout dah :V
Bill: If were being honest, your primary motivation to play the game at all was to cosplay.
Nokri (Marisa): omg i'm telling my mom
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah that's true tho I see now it's a dank ass game
Afina (Georgia🍀): Prob would've bought it eventually
Nokri (Marisa): i can play nintendo games owo
Nokri (Marisa): something something rick and morty reference
Afina (Georgia🍀): _a show for intellectuals only_
Afina (Georgia🍀): But yeah idk what was the last anime I watched before Yona huh
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe it was my hero, when it only had a season 1
Nokri (Marisa): georgia we're here to help what anime do you need what genre do u like
Afina (Georgia🍀): I like my anime like I like my videogames, _action with a romantic subplot_
Nokri (Marisa): Goblin Slayer maybe when that comes out? 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm like the opposite of a hipster too I really watch only the popular amines
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which I watched most of those in my YOUTH
Nokri (Marisa): das gonna be popular i can guarantee it

Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh yeah Lily liked that
Aldus (Jess): It gud
Afina (Georgia🍀): You cosplay from it, I would assume you think it good lmao
Nokri (Marisa): re:zero and magi
Aldus (Jess): My other favorite is psycho pass but that's more psychological thriller/crime
Aldus (Jess): There's like no romance but you can get yourself some nice ships you'd kill a man for
Afina (Georgia🍀): Saw magi, wasn't too into it
Nokri (Marisa): ye i didn't think it was that great either but it's colorful
Afina (Georgia🍀): I've heard of re:zero?
Nokri (Marisa): was suuuuper popular. has the blue and pink maid twins
Afina (Georgia🍀): I remember psycho pass being popular when it came out
Aldus (Jess): ~~tom had to stop watching re zero cuz the main character was such an idiot~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOP don't like ditzy animu ladies
Nokri (Marisa): main is a guy :3c
Aldus (Jess): Oh no
Afina (Georgia🍀): Unless that was a dude
Aldus (Jess): He a boi
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh gosh
Nokri (Marisa): his speech in the one episode when he finally loses it is the cringiest
Aldus (Jess): And yea me too, I do not like the ditzy girls
Nokri (Marisa): ~~*desii*~~
Aldus (Jess): I think that's when we stopped
Afina (Georgia🍀): _shes not stupid_
Aldus (Jess): Shots fucking fired
Nokri (Marisa): desii is genius and kawaii but ditsy
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmm yeah I trust the Garrity Judgement™
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah ditzy is like clumsy AND stupid
Nokri (Marisa): orly? :0
Nokri (Marisa): my life is a lie
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeeee
Aldus (Jess): I'm watching Erased rn it good so far but thats crime also
Aldus (Jess): I like crime shows opps
Afina (Georgia🍀): Jess like da crime?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lmao I see
Aldus (Jess): Ye
Nokri (Marisa): the anime of that is pretty short too
Aldus (Jess): I mean theres some romance here it's pretty cute
Aldus (Jess): I like psychology and crime thingies opps
Nokri (Marisa): do you like movies? have you seen studio chizu stuff like summer wars, wolf children, bakemono noko
Aldus (Jess): My fav regular show is Criminal Minds
Afina (Georgia🍀): I saw wolf children yeee that cute
Nokri (Marisa): my house has criminal shows running 24/7 they all blur together for me
Afina (Georgia🍀): And a lot of ghibli
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof why am I so tired, I can't nap at 9 pm that's called going to bed
Aldus (Jess): ~~i like criminal minds also because of hot skinny nerd boi with long hair~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOP
Nokri (Marisa): is that the guy who always calls the girl who's really fancy and fashionable and people call her baby girl and she's like the tech wizard
Bill: Rezero is garbage.
Aldus (Jess): YES
Bill: Nier: a really great game hidden under the directors obsession with butt.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^^^
Bill: Also have you told Justin you wanna A2?
Aldus (Jess): Garcia is the hacker girl and Morgan is the guy who calls her baby girl
Nokri (Marisa): have u ever noticed the artist for the madoka magica game has some kind of stomach fetish
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk how you do 2B Jess, that's a lotta booty to have at a con
Nokri (Marisa): ooGARCIA YEAH that's it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee I told him
Afina (Georgia🍀): He said "idk you'd be a good 2B too"
Bill: Ooooh WAIT.
Aldus (Jess): Be proud of your booty
Bill: He hasn’t played it either.
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I was like 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Bill: Ha.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye Justin's not there yet
Bill: Yeah, you guys should lock into those.
Bill: It’ll be a great... snrk... pairing.
Afina (Georgia🍀): >->
Aldus (Jess): Tell him to stop letting his man show 😱
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why
Bill: Jess know why I’m snarking.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani
Aldus (Jess): He wanna see da booty
Afina (Georgia🍀): He said it was cause she's a tsundere and I was like whAT
Aldus (Jess): So he calling you tsundere?
Bill: You don't even like the tsundere part of Weiss.
Aldus (Jess): ~~nokri/2b crossover when~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aldus is 9s?
Afina (Georgia🍀): IM NOT EVEN A TSUNDERE I'm very open about my feelings on everything ever
Afina (Georgia🍀): I wake up, I'm like damn I love my friends
Aldus (Jess): You don't even call people baka
Afina (Georgia🍀): B-baka
Bill: 👆
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean her outfit is more fashionable that A2
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I think I could swing A2 with the same material that you guys have on yours
Afina (Georgia🍀): It'd just be a matter of finding it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause that stretch latex shit that a lot of A2s have isn't flattering
Bill: You just hate latex.
Bill: Justified.
Bill: Finish the game first.
Bill: That's the best plan.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I have seen 10 whole cutscene seconds of A2 and I already love her
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof I wanna play more but I've been playing so muchhhh
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also I haven't seen spoilers but there's some nice ass pics of A2 and 2B
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😏
Aldus (Jess): ~~nice nsfw ones~~
Bill: Well, the personality plays a part.
Bill: Everything is NSFW, it's Nier.
Afina (Georgia🍀): A2's personality?
Bill: Yeah, like, she gets more than those 10 seconds.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I would think so yeah lol
Bill: so you can decide then if you're interested in 2B 2.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll just cosplay them all, throw 9S in the pile too :V
Afina (Georgia🍀): Me Tom and Jess can just rotate
Afina (Georgia🍀): Though I doubt tom would wanna borrow 2B from you Jess 🤔
Aldus (Jess): That's ok
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~even if lily thought he cosplayed that one at first~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Literally she walked down like: why'd you choose THIS game
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I was all: well tom and Jess liked it enough to cosplay it so I'm gonna try it
Afina (Georgia🍀): *2B lands after the flying thing crashes*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lily: so tom cosplays that one?
Aldus (Jess): O.O
Bill: ~~Not playing it because you want to do another group cosplay with Tom and Jess, no~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: 😛
Afina (Georgia🍀): Listen, if Hal even cosplayed Eve
Afina (Georgia🍀): What a fucking time
Aldus (Jess): but then is tom gonna be adam or 9s?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooo good point
Aldus (Jess): tiny adamxtol eve
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^^^ I'm here for it
Nokri (Marisa): cosplay both at the same time a la
Afina (Georgia🍀): NGL id cosplay 9s 🤔🤔🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not one for crossplays like, ever
Afina (Georgia🍀): But 9s for that SOFT FACE
Bill: ~~just wait till C route~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani
Aldus (Jess): who do you like mroe
Aldus (Jess): 9s or a2
Afina (Georgia🍀): Uh uh uh I think it's biased cause I've only seen 10 seconds of A2, currently 9S is in the lead
Afina (Georgia🍀): With more than 10 seconds though, A2 could be da qween
Aldus (Jess): im not talking cosplay tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye overall
Bill: That's what she talking about.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cosplay is inverted
Aldus (Jess): yea ok just making sure
Afina (Georgia🍀): _why does that feel like such a cryptic question_
Afina (Georgia🍀): _what do you guys know that I don't_
Bill: hehehhe
Aldus (Jess): na i was just wondering
Afina (Georgia🍀): All three of these bitches are on the cover so there's no way 2B is gonna have to choose between the two
Aldus (Jess): oh no
Aldus (Jess): nah that doesnt happen
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmm I wanna keep playing to find out but my hand is literally sore
Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably more gym related than videogames but still
Bill: Now I'm going to play it again.
Elfriede (Tom): wow that took forever to catch up
Elfriede (Tom): im here
Elfriede (Tom): and you arent neir the end of the game yet i wanted to clarify
Elfriede (Tom): just like... route A
Nokri (Marisa): WOOOOOOOOO
https://ordinal-strata.com/collabo/runefactory4/
Nokri (Marisa): mfw someone insults rune factory, using a rune factory gif
https://i.makeagif.com/media/2-07-2015/xwczsu.gif
Elfriede (Tom): i would never insult rune factory
Elfriede (Tom): ~~but stardew valley is superior ~~
Nokri (Marisa): (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): *they're all memes*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe2cE-eVhtg
Elfriede (Tom): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): NIER the end ahahaaaa
Afina (Georgia🍀): Alright if I get fisted by this spider one more time in making the difficulty easy
Aldus (Jess): YOU CAN DO IT
Elfriede (Tom): 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): DA BOI IS DED
Afina (Georgia🍀): Uhhhh Eve is alone at a table
Aldus (Jess): yea cuz someone killed the the only person in the world he had to talk too <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Who would do that 😬
Bill: oh shit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I'm not good at telling what is main mission and what is side quests
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I feel like my completion of this game is gonna be really low
Bill: you'll be fine.
Bill: Main missions are stuff from YoRHa command, everything else is sub quest.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah and the main missions don't appear on the quest thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk it may just be me
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmmm Eve killed me
Afina (Georgia🍀): I didn't buy enough recoveries
Bill: Oh right, use auto heal, deadly heal, and the chip that heals when you aren’t get hit.
Bill: They help a lot. Specially deadly heal.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I haven't been using chips like this whole time
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also I had one recovery and kept dying to eve
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg no I went back to my previous save
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's before the spider guy
Afina (Georgia🍀): Fuck this 😭😭😭😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm quitting Nier
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like I sucked playing this game 😱
Afina (Georgia🍀): [one ragequit later] alright I'll try tomorrow
Nokri (Marisa): that's the spirit! owo
Elfriede (Tom): Oof chips are so important
Elfriede (Tom): They help Soo muchhh
Elfriede (Tom): I don't remember, do chips transfer over to route B?
Elfriede (Tom): Oh shit I forgot if you die and don't get to your body you lose all your equipped chips
Aldus (Jess): Yee
Bill: Yeeee. But you won’t die so much with chips.
Bill: That’s why it’s been so hard Georgia.
Bill: Ye, they transfer over To.
Bill: Nice to want to blaze through the game, but you need chips.
Nokri (Marisa): People do the same things in Rune factory 
You gotta work on your smithing level but people ignore that and just buy weapons from Bado instead or rely on good monster drops but when you get to around level 80 or 100 or so those won’t do anymore and you’re way too under leveled for sharance maze to find drops there so you gotta grind your smithing and crafting levels from the bottom <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): I crafted some sweet double swords that were invisible and had super long reach and shot rainbows and also whenever it touched something it would poison, paralyze, put them to sleep, and make them sick all at once. 
My swords crashed the game a few times.
Elfriede (Tom): YEAH
Elfriede (Tom): https://youtu.be/y4-wCDFXH2A
Elfriede (Tom): I didn't know this was a mechanic
Elfriede (Tom): Just like I didn't know til end game that if you pressed jump and shoot at the same time your pod would throw you
Elfriede (Tom): Or jump and heavy uppercuts
Aldus (Jess): me whenever i lost to adam:

Afina (Georgia🍀): Mentally I was like: I'm not gonna shame these kinksters
Afina (Georgia🍀): PLOT TWIST ITS CANON SADNESS
Bill: it's not *just* a thing you like to do. It's more than that. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Bill: Well, the Blake lasted the whole story.
Bill: In very Blake fashion, she was kinda into it.
Aldus (Jess): STORY??!
Aldus (Jess): i told a whole story?!
Aldus (Jess): i have no filter
Aldus (Jess): did the story have to do with tom?!
Bill: ,... Who... else do you have stories with?
Bill: Course it was about you two.
Aldus (Jess): ~~i have exes~~
Aldus (Jess): oh thank god
Aldus (Jess): i mean still though what fuck
Bill: ~~You didn't exist before Tom started dating you~~
Bill: I mean, if it was about an ex at least you could have played it off all casual like. It was rather incriminating.
Aldus (Jess): oh no 😦
Aldus (Jess): OH i might remeber now
Aldus (Jess): i may be a terrible human being
Bill: tbh If you had offered to Blake to retry it, she might have done it. Too bad you went for Ruby.
Aldus (Jess): ok nope still lost
Aldus (Jess): im dying here
Aldus (Jess): something about sharing drinks?
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😮
Elfriede (Tom): I'm also lost it's okay
Afina (Georgia🍀): What sexual experience do you have that's "out there" and yet not remember it nani the fuck
Bill: what she doesn't *remember* is which one she shared.
Aldus (Jess): IM DYING

Bill: I know, but I was too far in to stop.
Aldus (Jess): were rwbys even there?
Bill: There was a guy ruby, I think a Blake too.
Aldus (Jess): ~~idk i thought maybe my drunk ass was like "hey u wanna 3some" or someshit~~
Bill: ~~That's the joke yes~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): :OOO
Bill: ~~Though I'm sure you'd make it kinkier than that~~
Aldus (Jess): you overestimate me fren
Bill: Maybe a Weiss? I just remember waiting hours for Tom to get Adam wig sorted out in the Grotto bar. Pretty sure we left grotto right over that, going for the indoor outdoor one.
Bill: OH, there was a cute 2B. I remember that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): CCE is gonna be a trip goddamn
Bill: Brandon and Tyler might have been there tbh. They knew guy ruby.
Aldus (Jess): tom didnt wear his wig there tho
Bill: He tried, then couldn't deal with the length and you went back to fix it.
Aldus (Jess): ~~ye that was me i was the sute 2b~~
Aldus (Jess): no
Bill: ~~it was not, not because your cute but I ain't flirting with my best friend/best friend's wife~~
Aldus (Jess): he went back to get his ID cuz you cant enter the grotto without being 21+
Bill: OOOoh, was that it?
Aldus (Jess): he didnt attempt the wig that night
Afina (Georgia🍀): NAH JESS YOU CUTE

Bill: I can say Jess is cute, I'm saying Jess isn't the 2B I was like "wow, she cute, I'd talk to her if I wasn't a *weeb*."
Bill: ~~It might have actually been chibidude's friend, if memory serves~~
Aldus (Jess): kananabread?
Aldus (Jess): some other dude thought i was cute cuz he came up to us all drunk and was like "doooood your a lucky guy"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Fuckin goals
Bill: ~~litmit test~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani
Aldus (Jess): ~~look i just wanted to make sure the moment i got married all my sex appeal didnt fly out the window ok~~
Bill: We meet up in Grotto, we left shortly after, I saw Grey getting over being sick with her then boyfriend who I just nodded to and left alone, we wanted to the front of the waterpark, I saw Dynamic Dutchess and attempted to remember her name, we did the indoor outdoor hot tub where I saw Richard, then we left that to go eat, which we drunkenly managed and that was pretty much it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Whaaat that doesn't happen
Bill: I think.
Bill: YOU are BEAUTIFUL, in EVERY single WAAAAYYYYYYY

Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye it does
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm watching legless 9S right now
Bill: ~~and I give Jess crap for the choking kink~~
Bill: Clearly I'm calling out the wrong one.
Afina (Georgia🍀): NANI
Bill: You don't pay attention at all do you? <=P The whole trolling story started from the '9S choking scene'.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye you should be giving 9S crap :V
Afina (Georgia🍀): He's the one who requested death by choking
Bill: ~~Ren and Nora are like the only duo cosplay they do that don't choke each other~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🤔
Bill: Adam chokes 2B, 2B chokes 9S, Unknown chokes 707...
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's a METAPHOR
Afina (Georgia🍀): I can't blame them
Afina (Georgia🍀): There's something very personal about choking
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like you could stab someone
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ok that's pretty personal
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or you use your OWN HANDS and kill them SLOWLY
Afina (Georgia🍀): VERY personal
Bill: Child. Choking and stabbing are very different.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah! One is more personal :V
Aldus (Jess): thank you georgia
Bill: If you think stabbing is a kink we better get Hal to a safe place. ~~Like Delaware, I hear it doesn't exist~~
Aldus (Jess): i mean knife play exists so
Afina (Georgia🍀): No thanks lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): But ANYWAYS it's poetic the choking
Bill: ~~well now we know what Electromagnetism will include~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): And in their case, two of their cosplays were enemies/pseudo-enemies
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani
Aldus (Jess): DAMN
Bill: Jess you right I'm a terrible person.
Bill: *I love it though*
Afina (Georgia🍀): NORA AND PYRRHA WOULDNT CHOKE EACH OTHER SILLY
Bill: 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): Non-canonical silly billiam
Bill: It's non canon cause Renora is a thing and Pyrrha is dead, but like... for some reason I picture it.
Bill: Not sure how they'd get there.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~who on who~~
Bill: Nora on Pyrrha. like, 80% sure.
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🤔
Bill: I'm not sure. I can see the scene happening, just don't know it'd get there.
Aldus (Jess): they are both so sweet i cant even imagine which it would be
Bill: I've never thought about a Pyrrha Nora relationship dynamic seriously.
Aldus (Jess): i mean in her actually relationship nora is prob dom
Aldus (Jess): unless theres a secret dom in ren somewhere
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🤔🤔🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): Doubt it
Bill: I dunno, I could see it.
Aldus (Jess): i could kinda see it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Naaah I don't
Aldus (Jess): like you think hes a cinamonroll but in bed hes like super spicy
Bill: It's *alot* of work to get him to want you, but when he wants you? Ain't nothing gunna stop him.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmmm nope still don't see it
Aldus (Jess): like not like kinky dom
Bill: ^
Bill: He's not going to go all Jumin Han.
Bill: Just like... *The one time he isn't passive*.
Aldus (Jess): yea like that
Afina (Georgia🍀): He's just _so quiet and passive tho_
Afina (Georgia🍀): As a _person_
Bill: People have layers. Much like onions.
Aldus (Jess): someones in bed personality can vary very much from they're regular one
Bill: especially someone like that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHAT THE FUCK 9S "MY PULSE IS RISING HUH WEIRD" WHATTTT????
Aldus (Jess): hes so sute
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg this is me actually setting my settings the first time over
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause there's long pauses from when I was texting you guys back ahahaha
Aldus (Jess): yeet
Aldus (Jess): lmaoooo
Bill: > Nora: Ren make me pancakes.
> Ren: *shrug* okay.

> Nora: Ren lets do LAPS
> Ren: if you insist.

> Nora: Ren, sloth sounds!
> Ren: I still don't know what this Nora.

> Ren: Nora.
> Nora: *turns around*
> Ren: *Kisses the fuck outta her*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Anyways, do peoples bedroom personalities really differ? 🤔🤔🤔
Aldus (Jess): its more like seeing another side to them
Bill: Ye no, Ren and Nora definitely switch places when it's intimate. Nora's shy with that stuff too, source the lyrics of Boop. So Ren's gotta step up for her.
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): thats what i was thinking too
Aldus (Jess): but like i could see him having those moments
Aldus (Jess): where he is not passive
Bill: Yup, it's just a random moment where Nora is doing something in the dorm and he's like "I love this." and he goes for it.
Aldus (Jess): but yea i mean its not like a completely different person but its like they do things you know if you told other people they did the person would be like "na they wouldnt do that"
Bill: Because you're comfortable being that way only with someone your so intimate with.
Aldus (Jess): yee
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like then he could be _forward_ but does that necessarily mean dominant?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tho I imagine dominant to be pretty intense lmao
Bill: Too intense, you reading too much into the word. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: He's just taking the lead.
Aldus (Jess): ye!
Aldus (Jess): like he aint tyin her up or anything
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooooooo that makes sense
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye I agree then
Aldus (Jess): the safeword is pancakes
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH
Bill: ~~It's Nora. She probably brings up pancakes regularly~~
Aldus (Jess): "after this, youre making pancakes right?"
Aldus (Jess): headcanon nora calls sex "making pancakes" but she says it with a different voice but rens always confusing which one she wants
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg
Aldus (Jess): ~~so he just goes for both~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Making pancakes! And making pancakes ;)"
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's the safe way to play it
Aldus (Jess): marisa is gping to come back to so much sin
Bill: Objection, the only time she would be 'making pancakes' is when she boinking Ren. Ren makes the pancakes in the relationship.
Afina (Georgia🍀): What does that _mean_
Aldus (Jess): no i mean like "hey ren,  how about making some pancakes"
Aldus (Jess): my mind is going bad places someone stop ,e
Afina (Georgia🍀): _w h a t_
Bill: *It's how Nora asks for the sex*
Bill: *That's what she's saying*
Aldus (Jess): noooo
Aldus (Jess): my mind went to 'batter' and then that went places
Bill: *How terrible of a person am I*
Aldus (Jess): havent you tortured me enough for one day
Dizzy: The jess's-kinks count is now 2!
Bill: !counter jess's-kinks set 2
Aldus (Jess): help me lord
Afina (Georgia🍀): SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT MAN CUM SMELLS LIKE PANCAKES

Aldus (Jess): yea no....
Aldus (Jess): ~~who is this man?~~
Bill: ~~Ren probably~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~does it taste like pancake thou?~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah shaun and Tushar said it
Afina (Georgia🍀): More specifically they agreed on it
Aldus (Jess): ok wait
Aldus (Jess): thats your ex yea?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nahhhh
Aldus (Jess): opps
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's the kid that was like "date me or were not friends" and I was like "ok bye" and he was like "wait"
Afina (Georgia🍀): I don't talk to him anymore cause he a JERK
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tushar's a good guy tho
Aldus (Jess): yea they were prob trying to play some trick on you
Afina (Georgia🍀): Stupid boys 😤
Bill: ~~That's a pretty stupid trick to play~~
Aldus (Jess): YUUUUP
Aldus (Jess): ive heard worse tho
Bill: I mean stupid cause it's just... dumb.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah and it's not like they see the full joke
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause logically from there I would be like "intimate lover Halim is this true" and he would be like wtf no
Bill: or... you'd google it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): So if they were messing with me they aren't even there to see the whole joke play through
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah Internet lies
Bill: I don't think the end goal is to get you to ask Hal.
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's my logical thought process tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): ANYWAYS I have confirmed it is false thank you science
Aldus (Jess): Who even thinks of that?
Bill: ~~it didn't need to be confirmed~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): College boys with nuthin better to do
