Afina (Georgia🍀): Alrighty let's try this again
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 🙌
Bill: Woo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ok I'm doing significantly better considering last time I lost most my recoveries in flight mode lmao
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: Yeee, weren’t expecting flight mode were you.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *im assuming you figured it out already but dodging just before your hit gives you the slow mo where you are immune to dmg*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: and can counter hit after
light gives you an uppercut to start an air combo
heavy is a hard high dmg strike
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ahaaaa
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also little does this game know
Afina (Georgia🍀): _im a pro with these light canon mechanics_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Alright I'm doing those two big gear spinny things again with 5 more recoveries than last time
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: wooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH HUH THE GEARS WERE ONLY PART OF THE BOSS
Nokri (Marisa): Surprise!!!

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Tom says as he's going to bed

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That 3 am yesterday is taking it's toll
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah what'd you get like 5 hours of sleep?
Bill: I’m working from home tomorrow, I can be stupid if I want.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow i wasn't gonna shoot the moose but then it charged at 9S and I was like OK NO
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yo those moose are no joke 👌 , esp when trying to hurt best boy
Bill: WHOOPS Apparently I forgot the Dresden Files had a side character named Georgia so now this cross over fic involves Pyrrha talking to Georgia.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Okay that ones pretty amusing
Bill: ,... it gets more awkward.
Bill: One of the other side characters, whose the leader of the group Georgia’s in?
Bill: Will.
Afina (Georgia🍀): LMAOOOOOO

Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): Are they really tryna blame doki doki for this
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I mean
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Did he commit suicide
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Cuz I could see that as a factor with that game 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah a person committed suicide but not because of doki doki. There’s an article saying that “he played this game once so this game must be the catalyst”
There are huge warnings at the beginning of the game too, I don’t think this would push someone over the edge.
Eliran (Halim): But Mawisa
Eliran (Halim): Its a Video game
Eliran (Halim): They cause everything
Eliran (Halim): Like they make people kill people with guns
