Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YES
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: At first I was like ah yes that's what I said, then the Reddit comments did the thing
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> is it considered bad form to button mash through the A,AA,AAA part of a combo?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: No
Bill: That’s good.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I do the same for sure, unless mine is bad form too, idk
Bill: Eh, you kick ass so it fine.
Bill: It doesn’t matter too much, unless you fail to switch to the new input in time.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah exactly
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: You get it 👌
Bill: Practiced actually doing combos when enemy is attacking. Getting there.
Bill: With Weiss anyway.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 👌 👌
Bill: Es needs work. She’s got much less combo game, at least in the trial area.
Bill: But she got a bomb ass sword so.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She's from blazblue right?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Her game is flushed out then cuz it's basically a copy paste
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She is a new character even for blazblue tho, so mayyyybe
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: What a cutie 👌
