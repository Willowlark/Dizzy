Bill: My parents think I’m drunk and I’ve had *two* drinks. Sigh.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Rip I had six ad my parents don't give a shit
Bill: Admittedly one was a 8oz hard liquor martini and the other had to be 4~6ozs bourbon.
Bill: But I’m fine.
Bill: I’ve started a BOURBON SMASH though which is nice.
Bill: Nat is my hero, she guessed ladybug from me saying Miraculous...
Bill: Best not aunt aunt.
Bill: Man am I done.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm home and ready for sleeps
Bill: Brauns just got here.
Bill: I’m just pissed with Katy for being katy and mom for assuming I’m drunk off my ass.
Bill: I’m now generally frustrated.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): shame the rest of your family for assuming you're drunk because that would never happen
Bill: It can. They just assume me happy is my drunk.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): *it would never happen*
Bill: It.... can. They just don’t understand I know my limits and I know when I’ve hit them.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that sounds annoying
Bill: Is whatever. Mom apologized and BOURBON SMASH is pretty strong stuff.
Bill: So I was partially at fault too.
