Bill: Alright, I'm the one who needs to eat a snickers.
Bill: Sorry I snapped.
Bill: A first for BNE, the voice channels being used.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hal re-added me on league and invited me to play in discord
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _weird weird weird_
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): I saw that I thought it was interesting
Did you take him up on the offer
O looks not good save
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): invisible i go
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): I wonder if hunter was talking to him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i suppose so
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): me: "this is weird, why did he re-add me"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): noah: "cause youre the shit"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats probably his attempt to reach out to me again, you think?
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Yeah that‚Äôs it looks like. Casually offering to play a game again in an attempt to reach out without directly just talking like a normal individual
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): interesting
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wonder whats going through his head that he decides he wants to be on good terms again
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Watch him be in trouble or want some kind of favor <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): "can you tell me if people are talking about me"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): "they are *logs off mysteriously*"
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ‚ÄúI need to go to space‚Äù
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): How did a smirk react on your post end up as a heart react on mine cmon discord
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its like that tuxedo mask gif
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): You didn‚Äôt even do anything or Christmas??

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): OMG MARISA

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): same wavelength
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): maybe its the secret santa
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): idk
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): maybe him and meg arent doing as well as he thought üëÄ
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): This was the other gif I was thinking of
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): the only reasons i could think that he wants to be on good terms is that 1) itll put BNE more in his favor or 2) he genuinely misses me
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): They gonna implode it‚Äôs gonna happen I bet
I don‚Äôt know enough about him to know his rationale behind stuff but I hope he knows how much you suffered and he also suffers :Fire:
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): üî• üî• üíÄ
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): statistically men suffer long after a break up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and women suffer immediately
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so while im over it, he may just be getting hit with the brunt of it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think thats unlikely but possible
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Ooo that could be it yeah
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Short foresight
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Make fun of him for his small foresight
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): I‚Äôm very glad he won‚Äôt be around our Katsu room ~~watch them get assigned like right across the hall or something~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ye me too that was a little eh that he was gonna be rooming with us
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): it wouldve detracted from the experience for me at least
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its kinda nice not having a boyfriend to have to stay on top of for con stuff
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i would have to tell hal he needs to figure out what to wear so he has time to make it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and then he would always procrastinate and never get it done
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like _i dont have to do that anymore_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): actually i was talking about making plans for "a big convention in february" and noah was like "oh katsucon?" and i was shoo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _he spoke nerd_
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Freedom!!
Is he going to Katsu owo
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Is he not a nerd owo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes not as hardcore of a nerd as we are
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): *a normal person*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he loves videogames but he said all the anime hes seen is creepy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like food wars
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Has he even read homestuck
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _no_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he also said i wont get him to cosplay but he was Scott Pilgrim from halloween and likes the idea of being spiderman sO
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Haha food wars
Why would a girl with a huge chest named after meat who only ever cooks meat and derives sensual pleasure from food be creepy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): id have to mother Hal tho which was admittedly annoying
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i was tellin tom and jess and bill that i had doubts about him over the summer cause our levels of organization clashed too hard
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Yikes. The reason he went to meg so quickly might be because he couldn‚Äôt function alone and needed someone else to get him in gear, though whether she can do that idk
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Organization for everything?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): lol no shes a party person
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah for everything
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): cons made it really obvious, but also life in general
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he didnt have any plans or goals or anything
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): he was too "go with the flow" to the extent that it was negative
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah he DID get with meg really quickly
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like r00d
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thought it would take that binch longer to get over someone he had talked about moving in with
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): !!!!!!!
wow yeah that's messed up!! wow
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i wonder if he was too afraid of committing to something so went with someone else who was also excessively carefree but who can't organize enough for the both of them
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): this is why cats are so much better everyone just get a cat
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah theyre like two trainwrecks laced together
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think thats probably true ya
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its no coincidence that the only trait that meg and i really have that overlap is that were generally likeable people
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~i mean i dont like her now but thats with a bias~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): otherwise were opposite
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): he only goes for pyrrha cosplayers
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): LOL U RIGHT
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): my sister's... husband? ex-husband? started getting distant one day and ran off with another woman. he didn't want a divorce and went to another state just so my sister couldn't officially divorce him. the woman he ran off with was trying to *be* my sister though, like she randomly met our mother once and got all astonished. She changed her hair to be exactly like my sister's and changed her style and got similar tattoos. she wound up murdering him and committing suicide so hopefully hal's situation doesn't end so direly but relationships can be crazy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): are you saying meg is gonna try to become me and murder hal
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): watch out, see if she switches to a physics major
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~not like i think she could do it but~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thats not even really a dig, i think most people cant do it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): just because SO many fail the weed out courses anyways
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ~~she might, watch yo back~~
i'm just tryna think of the logic behind their thought but my relationship course professor was fired halfway through the semester because he didn't know what he was doing
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ye physics is insanely difficult and competitive
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i think hes just looking for the opposite of me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i dated a really edgy guy before hal and then i dated hal which is like a teddy bear
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): no edge
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hes just a little stupid
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and now ive dated someone unmotivated like hal
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and now noah is very type A and workaholic
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ~~next on the opposite list: furry~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): veyda was a furry
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tarik was not

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): that me
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): furry is the 4th base of a relationship
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): furry is the home run
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): actually i think noah is the first motivated person ive dated
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): veyda was a high school dropout that works at ritas
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tarik failed out of rutgers and now works at 7/11
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): hal is skipping class, has failed out of his honors program, and works at starbucks
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): noah is a 4.0 student with an internship with the head of the physics department üòÜ
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _why did i date so many unmotivated people marisa_
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): a good boy for best girl
*you gotta find the diamond in the rough you just had to dig a bit*
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): it's like in noragami where hiyori's potential partners are all cultists or addicts at first and then she scores a god
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): m o o d
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ik you dont concern yourself with bois marisa
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but how is your _cat_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): does the kitty have cat drama like theres boi drama
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): yeah!!!! sometimes there's an orange cat at the back door and they fight through the glass. or for a while there was a bird that i guess was obsessed with a mirror we had out back so she'd sit and watch the bird attack the mirror every day for like a month.

she likes to play with the tabs and caps of plastic milk bottles and she has a stash somewhere but we don't know where. she just has an unlimited amount of these tabs. also before I came to Japan she lost her mouse (it's a big grey mouse toy i won at a skating rink when i was little that she loves), and I tore the house apart searching every little nook and cranny for that mouse. Couldn't find it. Bought her lots of toys but none were the same. Apparently around a month after I left she came bounding down the stairs with the mouse like it was never missing. where was it. she knew its location where had it been that whole time ? ????
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i fear she isn't getting enough exercise or enrichment because our house is mega tiny and she can only look out the back window and BoJo doesn't put youtube videos of birds on the TV for her to watch but she is eating much healthier now <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): do you have a pet?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oh cat stashes are too real
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ive seen people busting their cats stash and being like WHY
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i have none, my mom and sisters are allergic to cats :c
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): hairless cats. get a goblin
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): noah brings his dog to rutgers sometimes tho and shes cute
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): shes some kinda shepard and her name is luci
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): is she big dog?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ye she not HUGE but she definitely big doggo

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Na uh cats, dogs, boys? That's prime conversation
Bill: Fair, just not tea.
Bill: And I can‚Äôt deny I have little interest in one. üòã
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): o looks toms brothers baby momma sent me a friend request... AGAIN cuz she keeps unfriending me whenever there is drama

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): right?
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): the cooldown period gets longer each time it happens. like a level up.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): are they back together? who knows? its a mystery
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): meg wrote 5 turn-ons and 5 turn-offs in her story except she only wrote 4 turn-offs and it bothers me that the 5th is missing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I just noticed that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Also she‚Äôs tiptoeing around Hal lol
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Also she blatantly described him
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): YEAH
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): that description was 100% him
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üçµ
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i wonder if he was having insecurity issues because that sounds like pandering
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~probably~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I know she has commitment issues
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~if "misogynistic": is a turn off i have some bad news for her. hal def has internalized misogyny~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): granted ALOT of people do and its hard to kick but i get the impression he thinks he isnt
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Her answers are so obvious omg
Bill: Good, maybe they'll come out with whatever they decide to call it.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i hope someone calls them out on it
Bill: I mean... if someone was going to they would have already.
Bill: Well, I guess some anon on insta could.
Bill: THAT would be funny.
Bill: We wouldn't get to see it though, cause they won't share it to BNE cause they seem to think we don't know?
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): some random guy who messaged her and she wrote back "who dis" probably saw the "i'd kiss the last guy i messaged ;3c" post and went "!!! i bet that's me!"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "are you dating anyone?"
IDK MAYBE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like really?
Bill: Doubt there'll be ever an answer to that... commitment issues.
Bill: *You've been living together for 20 years, have two kids, and haven't been apart more than a few days in all that time*

*I dunno, maybe we're Friends with Benefits?*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): HAHAHAHA

No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): drag jared back here
Bill: I've tried.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): just fill the game chat with "hal" and nothing else just people saying his name and see how long it takes him to realize
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~jared is not a stupid fuck kthx~~
Bill: Look I love him but he makes me sad. I always feel likes he's all alone down there.

Bill: shit I was going to say the same thing.
Bill: So much for holding my spot in line minute clinic. I can‚Äôt wait 30 minutes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I wanted to get my hair done this weekend (and tom too) but losing a day of pay has got me feeling guilty about droppin like 150 on hair
Bill: Gotta take care of yourself though.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im not gonna get sick if dont get my hair done or something though
Bill: But you‚Äôll feel that seasonal depression all the worst cause your sunshine hair needs repair.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üò≠  so much money

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): #logic
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lol thats not my boss though XD he is always braggin about being rich though
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): bless my coworker, he had a meeting with my boss where he got bitched at for an hour and my boss tried to blame me for something and my co worker defended me üò≠
Bill: Good boi
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea it was over spelling errors on something and my coworker said "No, thats on ME you will not drag her into this, thats not part of HER job" 
also my coworker has dyslexia and honestly i feel bad he gets bitched at for stuff like that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~I suspect i might have it also but ive never been diagnosed with it~~
Bill: I feel like they have to be over exaggerating a little bit with these things people say to them at cons, but like, I seriously worry about how I come off with new people cause shy/lackluster social skills/sarcasm but if THIS is the bar I need to be above...
Bill: ~~why did Gen at Tom~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz of me saying I bloat so much I thought I was pregnant

Bill: I'm terribly happy I'm not the only confused one.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nah I'm still a bit confused
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean it didnt make direct sense
Bill: I thought it was some hip lingo.
Bill: ~~or something everyone whose actually been in relationship would know~~
