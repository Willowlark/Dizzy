No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): try uhhh broccoli
Bill: *i did.* kinda.
Bill: Moms been on this green tea vegetable fruit powder kick, she’s wanted me to try it. Not bad, so I doubt it’s actually a “days worth of vegetables”.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): If it nutrition related you'd have to eat well for sevel days before seeing the effectS
Bill: Yeaaaaah but like. Ugh.
Bill: I’m always dead when we decorate.
Bill: I dunno how.
Bill: ~~maybe it’s the trip it’s New York we do every Friday before~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Maybe you just don't like decorating?
Bill: Lol you right. Not really my thing.
Bill: But I’m also a member of the household and family, so it’s my responsibility to help. Besides, can’t leave the folks do all the work. I enjoy the decorations and holiday parties too, so I should help as much as possible.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i brought up the tree from the basement last night so i punched my decorating ticket
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I gotta... Do it all
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Tom will prob help get the boxes up but then I usually do the rest by myself
