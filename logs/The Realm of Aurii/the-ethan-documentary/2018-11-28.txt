No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): how do I say "no" to a good classmate if they want to use my notes?

we have a big final exam today and we're allowed one (1) cheat sheet and I spent hours cramming and organizing a ton of information in size 4 font onto a piece of paper, and my classmate sees it and goes "oh can you send that to me so I can use it too" 
some of the stuff probably won't make any sense to him because it's just for me to remember things, and he'll have no clue how the top is organized which'll make finding stuff hard, but I feel like he should make his own cheat sheet? the exam is in 6 hours what was he gonna write on the sheet if he didn't have one made yet. I said yeah because I had an extra anyway and I didn't know how to decline but it's lingering on my nerves.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _scramble the notes on purpose_

Bill: Hunters got new stuff?
Bill: If Hal has something to say, he should say it not do so over league. Wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i mean hunter confirmed hal and meg
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and he said hal hasnt been going to class
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): just low level gossip was all he told me at thy geekdom

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He acted a little strange
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh gee I wonder why

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah like I know he knows about Noah but
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He asked about him when we played
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): O RLY
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I DIDNT KNOW THAT
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hal is a gossip monger tho
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I told him that he was quiet when we hung out and he said: 
Oh that's sad, understandable tho, if you were a non cosplayer coming.to.a party of a room full of cosplayers,you'd prob be quiet too
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But that was it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Huh
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah I feel weird likeI do not want to be friendly with Hal based on how he‚Äôs acted in chat
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause he‚Äôs been a real butthead
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But he was pretty kind playing league
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He has
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And yeah he was
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Same experience
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So I get MIXED SIGNALS
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean league is when we‚Äôre as close to being alone as we gonna get
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So maybe I should take that to be the real Hal
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I‚Äôm very much annoyed by his actions as a group
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Eugh I feel weird
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I could only get a slight read on Hal
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And that was that he felt very awkward and weird, but was also trying
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I believe he genuinely wants to be on speaking terms
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah..
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Is that the feelies you got yesterday?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah pm
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Idk I thought about it last night, if he really wants to be talking again I think I would ask him like... what the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Hal  is
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He still said a select few things that made me go "hmm" I remember but nothing out of the normal for him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Just like something dumb he said but I don't remember what it was
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It sucks, I too am a gossip monger
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That‚Äôs where Hal and I really overlapped
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I remember the week after we broke up he asked me who was interested in me already
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I was like uhhhh???
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Sounds about right tho
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He did also.mention that to.me oddly enough
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That he knew people were already interested in me?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _this is an awful lot of Georgia talk what the fuck Halim_
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like, that you spoke about it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean he asked so I was like sure lemme take out my list of suitors I have on hand of course
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He had mentioned that girls from his college were interested in him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But he wasn‚Äôt doing anything for a while
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Who would‚Äôve thought Meg would be ‚Äúthe girl from college‚Äù
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Eugh I feel weird
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I do not like this conflicted feeling
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah.. it's understandable tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like I‚Äôm still very much mad at how he went about the break up
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I‚Äôm mad about how he talks in BNE
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah exactly
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But he was once someone I was intimate with, so I know he‚Äôs not a bad person
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And he‚Äôs kind and his more usual self in league
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Tho he‚Äôs not exactly the Hal I remember from the summer tho
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Aaaaaaaa I h8 boys
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): They are illegal now
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): No boys. No girls. Only cheesecake.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): O wise Marisa, give me your advice
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): *places a Yona manga offering and Pocky at the Marisa shrine*
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): I accept your generous offering 
My advice is to floss your teeth and make sure if you go hiking your shoes have good tread but aren‚Äôt brand new they gotta be broken in a little. Hope that helps.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Best idea always
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): If you want to talk with him in private it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to message him on your own terms. But he might show your messages to others so keep all your receipts in case he pulls something weird. 

Also it‚Äôs like super easy to make your own pasta. Just get some flour and water and bam. You got pasta.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): https://tenor.com/Or0L.gif
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): In all seriousness its pretty normal to feel that way I'd say
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He's back to being the way he was when you liked him the most

...at least over voice call
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Partially
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): ~~also its still only been a few months too so I could see that still being wierd~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Idk how wierd you feel about it, maybe I'm over analyzing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like I don‚Äôt still LIKE him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But he has my sympathy cause I know what he‚Äôs been through and how he is as a person
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): No it's not that, I mean more like nostalgia ya know
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Sorta
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah it is a little bit nostalgia-y
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I‚Äôm the forgive and forget type too (I wish I wasn‚Äôt but alas) so it‚Äôs pretty easy to get my sympathy to begin with
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So I want to be angry that he‚Äôs being a fUCK but I‚Äôm also like ‚Äúbut he has such a hard life‚Äù
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah....
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): ~~BOI YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT A HARD LIFE~~ 
~~flexes~~
~~marisa slides in and flexes too~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): *wierd flex but okay*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nah when I talked to him it lightened my opinion of him
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But I haven't forgotten yet üëÄ
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I MEAN HES A JERK BUTT FOR BRAGGING ABOUT ALL THE SEX HE HAS AND BERATING ME FOR HANDLING IDENTITY THEFT AND ALSO BANGING MEG SO QUICK
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Buuuuut I know he doesn‚Äôt want to be failing classes like he is, and he‚Äôs stuff under his moms thumb, and it‚Äôs not his fault that Meg is _probably_, lets be honest, a rebound
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Hal and Meg have little potential to ‚Äúget serious‚Äù with their personality types combined
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah true, idk how that's gonna go
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah I mean I shouldn‚Äôt care
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I do because like, dammit, I was a little paranoid about Meg while Hal and I dated
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And my hunch proved to be GOOD
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Anyways yeah I feel conflicted because I logically want to hate him but our history makes me predisposed to forgiving him and talking again, even if I myself don‚Äôt want to
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): :dab
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And with that I go to bed to stop thinking about it
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): The Pro strats
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): GOODNIGHT FRIENDS

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Just me and you üòÇ
Bill: You don‚Äôt have to be friends with him if it‚Äôs uncomfortable. You don‚Äôt need any more reason than that. I learned that with Ethan, he never did anything to me and seemed to want to be friends; so I felt like I had no reason to refuse. But he made me uncomfortable with how he treated ~~you~~ others, and I had to tell myself to trust my gut.
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): " HHS finalized a rule that would allow nearly any employer to claim a moral or religious exemption to Obamacare's birth control mandate" ~~and this is why im on toms insurance and not on my company's~~

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yepyepyep
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He's done all 3 of those already right
Bill: throw back to when you were going to look for a new job.
