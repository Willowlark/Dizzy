Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You’re right bill, my 4K followers will protect me from the shitstorm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lmao
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): LMAO
Bill: Not fucking at all.
Bill: Your 4K followers makes you a bloody target.
Bill: If you can be swayed, you’re a famous RWBY cosplay who supports opinion whatever.
Bill: This HAPPENED with the Mist witch hunt.
Bill: You also have way more to lose by affecting your image, which makes you “weak”.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean as long as she stays out if shell be fine she survived the mist bs just fine and this is les serious
Bill: True and true.
Bill: But Mist required plenty of damage control.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): from georgia?
Bill: Both of us helped draft messages and opinions to keep Georgia neutral remember?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but idk i dont think i see it the same way you do
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ethan is like a kindergartener chucking rocks at the college kids
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you see all this as wars waiting to happen  i think i just see it as regualr ol drama
Bill: Fair. I assume the worst so the worst doesn’t happen
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Meg is still goin
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and why do you assume the "fight" will be taken to her anyway?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Because I ran the photoshoot where both the proposals happened oof
Bill: And Ethan is NOT Mist and Jake, so the only real issue is if Ethan tried to pull a Snow ™ and name drops Georgia saying she’s related by some thing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but like just be like "as far as i kne it was just dudes proposing to their gfs"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im not saying you cant be pulled in im just saying theres no point in worrying about it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean with that mentality ethan could come after us next
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he wont though
Bill: Anyway, you may be right and it’s going to stay just drama. I’m just the type to batten the down the hatches to prep.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i dont think theres need to worry just yet
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i dont think im getting a lunch today coo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ok finally watched Ethan's
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ok watched Chocos too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hers seem like pieces are missing?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like she was talking about how he bf lost the ring before the proposal or something like that and then next video did not continue the story
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Anyway no Ren and Nora's better get married cuz that's OURS. WE OWN IT
Bill: YEAH
Bill: Wedding shoot when!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): When Tom  has a suit 😂
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm not in whatever group this started in obviously cuz I don't go to rtx but idk like to know the og convo
Bill: It sounds like it was in person.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): She said some about the "rtx attendees Facebook groip' I think
Bill: That was the photographer thing.
Bill: It was public iirc, I remember seeing Georgia comment on it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that's I mean thou
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Well I was gonna post some Renora today but I think I'll hold off
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also she didn't name names so good on her
Bill: Meanwhile he was spitting them like they were on fire.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Choke-a-waffle
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Seriously Ethan?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like he's 10 oof
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea for real
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Oh man I don’t like ethan but I gotta admit I don’t like meg more
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I have come to terms with that now
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I can admit to myself that I do not like her
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I didn’t WANT to because I thought Meg and I could be cool friends buuuuut we’re probably Eskimo sisters now so it’s just weird
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but like do you not like HER or do you not like her cuz of hal?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I think I thought I knew who she was
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And her dating hal despite her and I starting to be friends was contrary to that conception I had of her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That makes sense
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I thought she could theoretically have any guy she wants and wouldn’t be trying to poach Hal
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But I think she jumped on him right away
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea which was kinda surprising
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Soooo Idk I don’t really agree with those actions
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean maybe I shouldn’t be surprised?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She used to be overweight and shy so I hear, so maybe she’s like “oh finally I can get boys now!”
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I didn’t want to think that of her but idk now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lol I used to be overweight and shy too but like
Bill: You never can really know someone though...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea plus it's all perspective
Bill: As much as Jess says she knows I’m going to do stuff all the time. 😛
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like I used to think she was a good natured party girl
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm right alot tho
Bill: You are, it’s why I tease you. 😛
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But now she seems kinda just like an airhead
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yes she's def a party girl
Bill: That’s your perceptions being tinted.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): “Kiribaku this” And “I don’t like emotions that” and “lol let’s get drunk” it’s annoying
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Her Kiribaku thing is definitely excessive .-.
Bill: You’re fixating on negative traits to validate your feelings.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I mean she might not be your type of person but yea what Billy said
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): She hasn’t done anything positive for me though 🙄
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): If my only experiences with her a negative then of course I’m not gonna judge well
Bill: Oh yeah, but I have a good idea where you’re at. I’d do this to Hal all the time in the past.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm not saying you aren't valid for thinking like that though
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Like I thought she was a nice person by default, it was only experiences that proved otherwise
Bill: I’m not sure jealousy would be the cause of your feelings, cause I’m pretty sure you’ve moved on, but it’s the same reaction. Jess is right you’re valid, and those are examples of negative things about Meg. Just keep in mind you have strong emotions and biases playing on your observations.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I also don’t like meg because she’s the same as Hal
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And I didn’t realize I hated a lot of traits Hal had because I was in love with him
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): But without those rose colored glasses, I realize are REALLY annoying
Bill: And I could have listed all those traits on the drop of a dime at one point. You notice these things when you’re emotions are running high. The correct answer is to dig down and figure out why you have so much negativity, and work on that. Your results may vary.
Bill: You can do and feel how you want to, sometimes being petty, salty and snappy is enjoyable, but you can learn from ~~my~~ our mistakes as people older than you.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean they’re traits that frustrate me over
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The overly party attitude
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The lack of plan for a future
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I know these things don’t affect me directly but immature actions like that are frustrating
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yes for sure, I'm just saying it might not frustrate you as much if not fur her involvement with Hal
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Na mean?
Bill: Yup. She’d just be a person you occasionally see at a con drunk.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Yeah
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s probably true
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Either way, still makes me anger
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye. Understandable 😂
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So either way, I will still appreciate when she gets insulted lol
