Aldus Larian (Jess): OH GOD i mean small women can get v. lorge
Aldus Larian (Jess): but i know alot of people like the headcanon that the twins father twins also because technically having a multi birth runs in families

Aldus Larian (Jess): and yea im not usre about the twin thing. its one of those things people just kinda "run with"
Aldus Larian (Jess): weather they are accurate or not
Aldus Larian (Jess): apparently its fraternal twins thats hereditary
Aldus Larian (Jess): and it only counts if it runs in the mother family it looks like so rip everyone
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Identical twins, on the other hand, result from one fertilized egg randomly splitting in two, creating two siblings with identical DNA. Because there is no known gene that influences this process, it is considered a mere coincidence when one extended family has multiple sets of identical twins."
Aldus Larian (Jess): SCIENCE âœ¨
Aldus Larian (Jess): thanks for coming to my biology lecture
Aldus Larian (Jess): but wait theres more:
Do twins skip a generation?
If you've heard that twins skip a generation, this myth is actually based on some truth. Here's how: If a man inherits the hyperovulation gene from his mother, he may pass this gene on to his daughter. His daughter, in turn, is then more likely to release more than one egg when she ovulates and therefore could conceive fraternal twins. So the twins have, in essence, skipped a generation.
Bill: "suprise Honey you'll probably have twins!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was actually highly interesting, sorry for spamming ðŸ˜…
Bill: That ain't spam.
