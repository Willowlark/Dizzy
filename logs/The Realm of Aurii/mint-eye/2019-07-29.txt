Aldus Larian (Jess): Tumblr has like fanfic/fanart weeks for characters, this week is saeran and next week is seven's.  Each day has like a theme/prompt. I did todays on the way to ota but i had no brain power to do any more on the way home last night

Aldus Larian (Jess): UGH i wanna do a drawing for tomorrow's prompt but i art SO slowly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What's tomorrow's prompt?
Aldus Larian (Jess): either weakness or memories  you can pick one or sombine both
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok ok so i know seven technically has a canon bathing suit but hear me out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YES
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Did you art that?
Aldus Larian (Jess): god i wish
Aldus Larian (Jess): something like thats prob way more recognizable than his canon one anyway
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): new art concept: non-canon versions of their swimsuits based on their canon outfits
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): give Jumin pinstripe jammers with an accent of purple on the left side
Aldus Larian (Jess): YAAS

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Is it supposed to be his back at the top there?

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think with the angle, you wouldn't really see his back
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo good point even better then!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it'd end up more like this
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Could also try to take a photo of yourself in the pose you're trying to do and use that as reference. That's what I usually end up doing
