Bill: Seven is a mood.
Bill: “It’s bugging me” is one of the best chats I’ve ever read.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol I have no idea which one that it
Bill: It’s Seven and Yoosung... they start talking about Seven having feelings and he like falls apart and starts denying it then redirects by saying he’s been helping spread Zen online for no reason.
Bill: And Yoosung is super supportive.
Bill: Sevens like “all I wanna do is watch the CCTV feed and make gifts” and Yoosung is like bitch you got feels.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ohhh yea!
Bill: Then Zen and Jaehee in the next chat start talking about Seven having feelings and that’s like. Everyone in the public chat talking about him having feels for MC and I’m like “he can read this guys”.
Bill: Which is also a mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: YUP BASICALLY THAT
Bill: What a mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess):
