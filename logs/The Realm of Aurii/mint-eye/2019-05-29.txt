Bill: 
Bill: Okay Jess I can’t be V, definitely Jumin.
Bill: There is no way I can imagine myself as SUCH a hippie.
Bill: *its been two years no more fucking Rika metaphors*
Bill: I gotta buy hourglasses to do the after ending.
Bill: But.
Bill: *V*
Aldus Larian (Jess): J~~ust watch it on youtibe~~
Bill: ~~But if I buy hourglasses I can do Ray’s route~~
Bill: -_-
Bill: You can’t skip the common route for another story.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wait... They come together tho
Bill: ?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why do you need hourglasses to play Ray's route when you already have another story
Bill: You REALLY thinking I’m going to be able to do all the chats in Rays route lol
Bill: I must have needed a good 500 to get through V.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whaaaaa
Bill: I missed so much over nezumi and being at Erik’s show. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Maybe 500 is a little high but it was like a dozen chats at 15 a pop...
Bill: And I miss night chats every night.
Bill: V’s after ending costs almost as much as another story what the fuck.
Bill: Also we need conspicuous blue wine to give to strangers.
Nokri (Marisa): That’s illegal
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's a thing
Nokri (Marisa): An illegal thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was playing the part when Unknown comes to the apartment and the flash floods warning comes up and I'm like "get tf outta here I'm busy"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also I never realized ukniwn isn't supposed to come to the apartment but he leaves mint eye without permission <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
He's so grounded
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHY is that part not voiced?! 😭
Bill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUdSe92i_tY&list=PLInHxqSskeajNOHKDRv_MejarATFGQbj9 is list both judge and forgive?

Bill: Damn hippie #1
Bill: Vandy what
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Party at Vs house y'all
Bill: Vanderwood: “Seven take your shit when you go awol”
Bill: Seven is the intellectual ace in the RFA... Jumin the rich/logical ace... and it becomes more and more apparent Zen is the heart of the group.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm assuming by ace you mean "wiz" and not like asexual
Aldus Larian (Jess): But yea zens good at emotional stuff 💕
Bill: *Yes that is a valid definition of the word*
Bill: Wait a minute.
Bill: Ray and Seven are IDENTICAL TWINS. How did Mc not point that out.
Aldus Larian (Jess): When?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like whiile she's at mint eye?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean they have different eye and hair colors it might not have been immediately apparent to her? Idk
Bill: I *guess*
Bill: Sad Seven is killing me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like people always tell me Tom and Mikey look the same but I'm like "lol what" cuz they have such different eye colors I just don't see it half the time
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea he's miserable
Bill: MC!

Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's ok, seven tells you he wants to take you to the space station too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "im dating your dad figure and your brother is dead"
Bill: *oh I get the vandy thing now*
Bill: Vandy is such a tsundere, just admit you like the dork.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hehehehe
Bill: 
Bill: ~~Daddy~~ Jumin finds out about Sevens family and is just like “Jaehee, after this glass of wine we’re taking on a public official for child neglect and abuse”.
Aldus Larian (Jess): HELL FUCKING YEA
Bill: You do anything to Jumin’s friends and he’ll buy you the plot of land for your grave.
Bill: *I def wanna be Jumin*~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cool, wanna give me an island?
