Nokri (Marisa): tbh unless the whole group is together i don't think anyone's gonna recognize anybody. maybe seven and zen can be because they've got more specific designs but it'll still be hard
Nokri (Marisa): yeah
Bill: Yeeee oke. I just use my white button up to be lazy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i low key feel like no one recognizes anyone in swimsuit lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): or at least they don't comment on it like 9/10
