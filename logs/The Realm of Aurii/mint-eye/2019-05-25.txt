Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't even remember the flash drive ðŸ˜®
Bill: ~~I know Rika insane but~~
Bill: Four collections, trauma, something, something, reunion.
Bill: Basically, four sides of Rikaâ€™s hidden personality.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea!
Bill: And he was going to photograph them.
Bill: So she could accept those parts of herself in the pictures.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: ~~I know sheâ€™s insane but that is. A really sweet concept as a photographer and I totally understand V there~~
Bill: The little things and all that. The little things are those hidden sides.
Bill: Wow.
Bill: Obviously she needs THERAPY, Iâ€™m not saying his theory is going to WORK. But the... art, or collections themselves?
Bill: I love that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's cute artistic concept
Bill: Yoooo I made jokes about this CG before playing but in context boy is Rika... whatâ€™s the word Iâ€™m looking for.
Bill: Silver tongued.
Bill: Itâ€™s a tad too... ~~culty~~ symbolic for me personally but they made her FEEL the manipulative person sheâ€™s made out to be.

Aldus Larian (Jess): Can't start a cult of your not charismatic
Bill: My phone gallery is full of quotable V and Jumin lines.
Bill: Fear.
Nokri (Marisa): Answer your mystic mess
Bill: By the end of today Iâ€™m going to need 2 or 3 hundred hourglasses to get all the chats and thatâ€™ll put my stock to 200ish. Iâ€™ll probably have to buy more.
Bill: And... Iâ€™m so hooked Iâ€™ll probably do the big one so I can play Ray.

Bill: There were chats at like, 11, 1 and 2 last night. I sleep at 10 during the week, I miss too many chats. ðŸ˜­
Bill: And another story is long I keep putting chats off cause I donâ€™t have enough time to play them and end up missing them.
