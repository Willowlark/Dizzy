Bill: So if your status goes offline, or invisible, you leave the chat. If you go online from offline, you enter.
Bill: So idle and DnD don't trip it.
Bill: Mobile status is a flag in the new api...
Bill: I might be able to rig it so it ignores mobile status changes...
Bill: We'll have to see.
Dizzy: *N🆗ri (Marisa) has left the chatroom*
Bill: Too bad there's no way to send a silent message.
Dizzy: *Chengu Tiaowen (Erik) has left the chatroom*
Dizzy: *Aldus Larian (Jess) has entered the chatroom*
Dizzy: *Chengu Tiaowen (Erik) has entered the chatroom*
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's neat but I kinda feel like it's just gonna crowd the channel 😬
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I go on and offline like 100 times a day
Dizzy: *N🆗ri (Marisa) has left the chatroom*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Woah I’ve left
Dizzy: *Chengu Tiaowen (Erik) has left the chatroom*
Bill: Ooooooh right y’all have push notifications on for every message don’t you.
Bill: That’s.
Bill: Going to make this hell.
Dizzy: RFA mode is now disabled for `mint-eye`.
Bill: !rfamode mint-eye false
Bill: ‘Twas fun to build.
Bill: More than anything.
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0 !!!
Bill: Topics don’t show up on mobile either. That sad.
Bill: Still. If you ever wanted to rp the RFA chat, Dizzy can do it.
Bill: ~~true evil would be turning on rfamode for the entirety of BNE~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh lord no
Bill: Oooo the drawer was openeddddd
N🆗ri (Marisa): topics show up on mobile if you swipe right!
Bill: OH
Bill: I never noticed that’
Bill: I check the user list all the time.
Bill: But never looked up.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: JAEHEE WITH THE COCKBLOCK
Bill: You can *tell* Seven is the canon ship.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "maybe someone will come" 
<:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~this is an extremely secure chat room only containing your trusted confidants and you have full control of its security~~
Bill: 😏
Bill: Hahahaaaaaa mood. Jaehee.
Bill: I think I like Jumin better outside his own route.
Bill: Course he was under stress in his own route, but by comparison Seven is better the more sides of him you get to see.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "full control over it's security" <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Fair.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does mint eye even have an address like. 
"Yea it's on 45 religious cult lane"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh wait yea I remember there's no address just coordinates
Bill: We at Mint Eye!
Aldus Larian (Jess): GOOD SHIT 👌
Bill: Aww the selfie is cuter in context.
Bill: Seven and MC are so obviously canon.
Bill: ~~maybe it's cause I wasn't conning during it but in general the writing seems way better than during Jumins~~
Bill: shit's getting good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What part we at?👀
Bill: They just confronted Saeran.
Bill: Now they locked in.
Bill: Also the next chat after that has Seven's profile picture changed.
Bill: Dude.
Bill: We're locked in an enemy headquarters.
Bill: Your twin brother just ran away and *locked us in the room*
Bill: and you're *updating your profile picture?*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea but he got the see his bro!
Aldus Larian (Jess): This is fine
Bill: sometimes you're in an extremely dangerous situation and you gotta text your guy Jumin and upload a new profile picture.
Bill: Vandy hold on what.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): GOOD PART
Bill: MeAnWhiLe my FAVORITE dumbass: "Huh this looks bad"
N🆗ri (Marisa): which one is that
Bill: <---
Bill: No Marisa, for once I'm not being self depreciating. 😏
Bill: Erik got it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i thought you were v though
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmaoooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Vandy: "thats a shitty fucking disguise u got there"
Saeran: "excuse me im having an existential crises rm"
Vandy: *yoink*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"It is me, the wonderful V. I'm going to disappear now and be a useless sack of shit because everything is my fault."*
Bill: ~~I said I wasn't being self depreciating Erikku <:pew:543202259085950996>~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I know, I was just quoting that one video~~
Bill: Shame there's no way in hell I'll find that coat for another story V. That look is nicer tbh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): makes him look like detective tbh
Aldus Larian (Jess): or like some dude whos gonna try to sell u something
Bill: That and I. get frustrated with how *not* twink I am in V so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): v is far from twink
Bill: Maybe it's not worth the alternate outfit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats ok thats how i feel in unkown
N🆗ri (Marisa): yoosung is twink
Bill: Girl they all twinks.
Aldus Larian (Jess): by tiwnk he means in weight not in height
N🆗ri (Marisa): boi you don
oh. oh we're not talking about the opposite of bears
Bill: height plays into being a twink?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Twink is gay slang for a young man in his late teens to early twenties whose traits may include: general physical attractiveness; little to no body or facial hair; a slim to average build; and a youthful appearance that belies an older chronological age.
N🆗ri (Marisa): twinks are small, it's like the western equivalent of a shota but not an actual child
Bill: Hmm. V that then. Yoosung would be if he wasn't actually pretty young?
Bill: I guess it doesn't cover the others.
Aldus Larian (Jess): V is in his late twenties tho
Bill: True.
Bill: Oh well.
N🆗ri (Marisa): v isn't a twink but yoosung definitely is
N🆗ri (Marisa): ray is a twink but saeran isn't <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: Replace twink with "scrawny anime boi" or "clamp normal boi" in my prior statement then.
Aldus Larian (Jess): isnt a twink technically gay tho?
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru is coming out to us, we're so proud
Bill: Does looking gay make you gay?
Aldus Larian (Jess): An attractive, boyish-looking, young gay man. The stereotypical twink is 18-22, slender with little or no body hair, often blonde, dresses in club wear even at 10:00 AM, and is not particularly intelligent.
Aldus Larian (Jess): opps its yoosung
Aldus Larian (Jess): sept the vlub part
N🆗ri (Marisa): twink and bear are gay terms, you wouldn't ordinarily use them if you weren't talking about someone who wasn't lgbtqa+
Aldus Larian (Jess): its could be ray but ray IS particularly intelligent ~~he just doesn't knoe it~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): so actually none of them are twinks rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): in biru's case they are because he's MC
Aldus Larian (Jess): shit u right
Bill: MC is totally useless on the mission tho.
Bill: But like I also totally get why he'd bring her.
Aldus Larian (Jess): MORAP SUPPORT
Bill: YUP
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): fun fact: otter is an in-between of twink and bear <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I'm all about the bring the person you like with you just for the hell of it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): basically a skinny hairy gay boi
N🆗ri (Marisa): then what's a very large bald boi
Bill: Saitama.
N🆗ri (Marisa): saitama skinny tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH WAIT
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think MC does something in the Secret end
Aldus Larian (Jess): Something important
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like physically important
Aldus Larian (Jess): I knew someone was gonna react with that <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *Important and lewd?*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Not that! ~~although that also implied~~
Bill: *Sign me tf up*
Bill: *~~sign me tf up for MC she that good shit~~*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know what u talkin bout
N🆗ri (Marisa): we all mc
N🆗ri (Marisa): mc is u
Aldus Larian (Jess): Birus thinks he's hot
Aldus Larian (Jess): We've fooled him into loving himself
Bill: Stick a fork in my and call me Zen.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:huh:555585958146473984>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I really like how they call back to saeran running away with having him run away like 4 times in his route
Bill: Am I the only one who sees this as his eyes open but the pupils just gone?
N🆗ri (Marisa): didn't jess see that too?
N🆗ri (Marisa): some people online did
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA I think I did
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm used to it now tho
Bill: The lines are set too high for a closed eye lol, so I always think he went demon.
Aldus Larian (Jess): At least it's not yoosung's bedroom eyes
N🆗ri (Marisa): his hair is down really low
N🆗ri (Marisa): bedroom/murder eyes
Bill: ~~I thought Jumin was the BDSM one~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): yoosung winds up in a collar more
Aldus Larian (Jess): Only once right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): There he is
Bill: ~~that's not actually Yoosung~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yes it is!
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a canon image
Bill: I know but like.
Bill: Yoosung is just.
Bill: God, he can't be scary.
Bill: he's too much.
Bill: Dumb.
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's the top yandere candidate tho
Bill: guess it's the gap moe.
Aldus Larian (Jess): When are we getting Ray's after end
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im gonna throw a party
Bill: Oh?
N🆗ri (Marisa): cosplay party?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Only Marisa is invited
Bill: Oh wow okay.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You'll make fun of me too much
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao jk
N🆗ri (Marisa): only if it's in the backseat of biru's car for 5 hours
Aldus Larian (Jess): But you haven't played his route so you cant
Bill: I was going to volunteer people as the tropes for each RFA member but I sEe HoW iT iS
Aldus Larian (Jess): Secret ending screening at my house less go
Aldus Larian (Jess): Erik hasn't finished it
N🆗ri (Marisa): but we already have cosplays we don't need the tropes page
Aldus Larian (Jess): I need to see it again
Aldus Larian (Jess): You can only cosplay as a version of saeran/Ray to the Ray AE party sorry it's the rules
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah she doesn't make the rules she just follows them
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or MC that's valid
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i don't have a canon mc outfit can i just show up as casual mc
N🆗ri (Marisa): take off my glasses
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~No you have to be Ray~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): "wow the new after ending looks great" can't see a thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): God Vs after end was so good too
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's it, we sacrifice everyone to the mountain and then we get ray after ending
Aldus Larian (Jess): If they release it for the twins birthday I'm gonna be so hype
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'll just cancel all my birthday plans for that instead
Aldus Larian (Jess): "where's Jess"
"Oh she playing rays after end but have fun at her party*"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa did you do the judge ending for Vs after end?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye!!

Aldus Larian (Jess): Ommgggg
Aldus Larian (Jess): That shit was insane
N🆗ri (Marisa): may cheritz prosper
Aldus Larian (Jess): The part where they all just trolled Rika I was like <:then_perish:554720548274569246>
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I think it was a dream? I can't remember
Aldus Larian (Jess): Was still great
N🆗ri (Marisa): cheritz: hey guys! watch this harsh roast and then watch rika's tragic backstory to feel bad afterwards!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye i think was dream

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I need to finish Secret End 2
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry im a bit distracted i'm trying to free some thread from this bobbin and listen to a story of people with the bubonic plague in 2019
N🆗ri (Marisa): people need to stop eating raw dead rodent kidneys
Aldus Larian (Jess): No it's ok I gotta go back to hiding from my coworker anyway

Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): its been ages since she posted here
N🆗ri (Marisa): ages
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *they say if you play the Another Story soundtrack you can still hear her sobbing into a bag of honey butter chips...*
Aldus Larian (Jess): its true
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: LOL
Bill: https://zentherainbowunicorn.tumblr.com/post/148399920206/masterpost I don’t know if this is the same brand infinite loops but mystic messenger loops would be great.
Bill: https://zentherainbowunicorn.tumblr.com/post/150727020607/everlastingpartyindex err this one.
Bill: I can’t really read it on mobile.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its on AO3
YOU BAKA: OH it's a fanfic. i was about to scroll through it like "where the pictures"
Bill: It’s got media apparently.
Bill: Like animated chats and stuff.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea it does
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive seen it before
Bill: That wasn’t loading nicely so I’ll save it for later.
Aldus Larian (Jess): just never read it cuz it seemed like just a recount of the story?
Bill: Oh oof.
Bill: Oh well.
Bill: If it’s not the infinite loops style it’s probably boring anyway.
Bill: Infinite loops is short snippets, which makes the snippets more straight forward and humorous.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i neveer saw the appeal in rwby loops personally but i know you really liked it
Bill: It’s not the time travel that makes it so good, it’s the snarky meta humor.
Bill: Once they know they’re in the loops and are fiction they lampshade and subvert themselves so much it’s fun.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i can sometimes read fics that go along with the story of something but it needs to have varients or MORE to it than just that.
Bill: Like, I was looking for it because “Zen takes a personality test and is Jumin” sounds like a snippet idea. Or worse, Zen and Jumin switch places for a loop.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and im not really into like comedy fics that much? like i like comedy involved but i dont like it to be the purpose
Aldus Larian (Jess): id read it as a one shot for sure
Bill: Yeee. It’s the comedy that’s good. There’s some serious topics in rwby loops, but not worth reading through to find it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): my fav AU fic was supposed to update friday but it didnt 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): I follow the author on Tumblr and have seen her getting really into another game recently and I'm just like *please don't forget about your MM AU fic I will die*
Bill: Oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): im not into crack fics but the description is still hilarious: 

Ft. Saeran as a cooking youtuber with anger issues, Saeyoung as a tumblr shitposting god, Minhee as a girl determined to get a date, Yoosung as a student just trying to pass his goddamn classes, Jaehee as a very tired TA, Jumin as a very annoyed TA, V as someone with very bad ex-girlfriend issues, Zen as a very salty theater major, and Vanderwood as a landlord that is sick of finding knife holes in the fucking walls. Oh, and Rika as the girl who went missing and now has a Buzzfeed Unsolved episode about her.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well i guess its more a college AU it only has one chapter maybe ill read it
Bill: That’s. Something.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok its somewhat cringey but also hilarious i take back everything
Nokri (Marisa): that's the game!
Aldus Larian (Jess): the characterization is still good so im in XD
Bill: YEAH
Bill: Characterization is so important in AU.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats what ussually breaks it for me i think
Bill: Yeah I can’t read stories with bad characterization even if the concept is great.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok I enjoyed that alot more than I thought I would  hopefully my I hid my face well enough that my coworker doesn't think I'm nuts cuz I may have been smiling
Bill: VVVVVVVV WHYYYYY
Bill: OUCH Seven. “Rika was right to hurt your eyes you’re a terrible person”
But also me, with meta knowledge: “about that.”
