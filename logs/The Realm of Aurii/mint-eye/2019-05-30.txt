Bill: 
Bill: Jumin says kill your daddy.
Bill: Oh uh. Mika huh.
Bill: Thats not how detox works you damn hippie
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is he talking to Rika or saeran?
Bill: Saeran.
Bill: God I just imagine Saeran and V in the woods and Saeran just yells “imma kill seven” randomly all the time and attempts to wear leather at any opportunity.
Bill: Also V is SUCH a hippie.
Aldus Larian (Jess): VESUS! 🙌
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea Vs a hippies it's great
Aldus Larian (Jess): Someone let that boi sleep plz
Vs gonna cure saeran with essentiall oils, organic fruit, and flowers
Bill: He’s less of a hippie as married man!
Bill: ~~Mc thank you~~
Bill: “When’s uncle jumin going to get married”
“Never probably honey”
MOOD
Bill: But also “poor Jaehee”
Bill: PFFT
Bill: Dad!V: “daddy’s good with secrets too”
Bill: AND THATS HOW YOU WERE BORN
Bill: Child: “I need to stab my father in this video game!”
V: “oh not again”
Aldus Larian (Jess): She's adopted!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I've only had Lucy for 10 mins but if anything ever happened to her I would kill everyone in this room and then myself
Bill: You say that like Jumin would have anyone who thinks of hurting her sniped first.
Bill: That was really great!
Bill: Until I remembered V is dead!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah he's fine! Looks he's right there!
Bill: V and Saeran wandering the wilderness is a great mental image.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg I know
Aldus Larian (Jess): It gives me life
Bill: Saeran: "Alright V. You did it. You finally got me to care about something more than hating myself."
V: "Did you find love in the sun Saeran?"
Saeran: "No I miss god damn shoes. These sandals you bought do nothing on this *gravel road*."
V: "No Saeran, you have to love the beauty of your own light-"
Saeran: "It's midnight. There is no light. Why couldn't we sleep in that HOTEL? You're rich, I know, I hacked your bank account at Mint Eye."
V: "How can you come to embrace yourself with distractions around you?"
Saeran: "In a four freaking poster bed? If that's not self love I don't know what is"
Aldus Larian (Jess): You get this cg if you do the judge ending
Bill: Saeran: "That's it, I'm calling Saeyoung. I may want to kill him but he actually spends his money."
Saeran:
Saeran, looking down: "Damnit I'm holding the knife again aren't I
Saeran: "Yup."
Bill: Oh that good too.
Bill: I'm just. so glad MC makes him get a haircut.
Bill: Damn hippie.
Bill: I wish *I* could draw, I'd love to write and draw 4koma man.
Bill: I like what Rika did too.
Bill: And THAT cg is phenomenal.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The cuddle one or the family one?
Bill: The Rika CG is what I meant by phenomenal, "that good too" was cuddle.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh lol
Bill: 
Bill: Insane, yes, but boi does Rika have a way with words.
Bill: 
Bill: Also why is MC just. wearing an apron.
Nokri (Marisa): If she didn’t have a way with words she wouldn’t of been able to form the RFA and Magenta
Bill: She wouldn't have gotten anywhere.
Nokri (Marisa): MC wear a dress 👗
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like how saeran is like "you'll still love me even if I'm ugly?" To both V and seven and I'm like "boi you couldn't be ugly if u tried
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea MCs wearing a dress
Bill: I kinda see now but TOTALLY looks like an apron over a sweater.
Bill: Saeran one of those choice pretty bois after all. Girls love em!
Bill: ;;;
Bill: OH I need confirmation Vandy also starts working at C&R!
Aldus Larian (Jess): He does? :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): I missed that
Bill: They don't say it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooooo
Bill: It's mentioned iirc, Jaehee says "we should have seven and his friend work for C&R" and Jumin like "yes, enslave them to my cat loving intelligence army", but Vandy disappears from the story.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awww I mean jumin literally offered everyone a job at some point across all routes so ya never know
Aldus Larian (Jess): Except v I think but everyone else gets a job offer from him including MC lolol
Bill: Yeee
Bill: "Everyone work for me so I can protect you while also driving you insane"
Bill: I wanna know the judge ending but I don't want to watch the 26 minute video.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh it's a trip
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven at noon: omg you like water? I like water! Let's get married!
Seven at 9:00pm: I have no plans of persuing a relationship with you, I hope you didn't have fantasies of me. 

Mmhmm sure I believe you
El🆓de Faun (Tom): IS TOM IN MINT EYE
El🆓de Faun (Tom): TOM IS IN MINTEYE ISNT HE
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I KNEW IT
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ALSO I THOUGHT MINT EYE WAS JUST RIKA AND SAERAN IN A SHED
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ETHERE?S MOAR?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): THUS
El🆓de Faun (Tom): TOMS IN MINT EYE
Nokri (Marisa): "don't worry i've read bl before" <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): omg there's so much more to mint eye
Nokri (Marisa): so much
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG you saw the comic
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Im gonna headcanon that Saeran and rika are in a shed with robes around a pentagram with a single candle in the center
Aldus Larian (Jess): Valid
El🆓de Faun (Tom): and tom is around back brewing the elixer
El🆓de Faun (Tom): he gets it ready
Aldus Larian (Jess): Noooo! Tom is sevens best friend
El🆓de Faun (Tom): to pour directly into V's eyes to make him blind
Nokri (Marisa): seven runs into tom and tom's like "woah, seven! you know mr. ray?"
El🆓de Faun (Tom): silly v
El🆓de Faun (Tom): thats not how you drink
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *V furiously pouring elixer into his eyes* "WHAT?"
El🆓de Faun (Tom): wow 7 you sure do look like mr ray
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uncanny resemblance
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao the idea that mint eye is only 2 people makes the scene where v sneaks in even funnier
Nokri (Marisa): "my ex-fiance and my basically estranged son will *never* recognize me"
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *Rica squints*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): was there always 3 members in this treehouse?
Aldus Larian (Jess): And my bright ass blue hair
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I read that too quickly and read it as "bright blue ass hair"~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean... It's apparently his natural hair color so yea I guess that too?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~blue pubes~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~blubes~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: YEEEE
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): *Unknown has left the chatroom*
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: That’s not true.
Bill: V wouldn’t be nervous from that at all.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: “Is this what your darkness needs Rika? I accept this and give you my light, bath in it and feel my love”
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg MC can be SO thirsty hen sevens at the apartment holy shit XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen: hey nothing happened last night right?
MC: Unfortunately no :(
MC PLZ
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmaooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): was that in Seven's route?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven: Im gonna go take a shower
MC: OH! ill fill the bath for you

MC: seven keeps looking at me in my pjs ;)

Yea! theyre all the bad answers tho XD
Bill: I was looking for V memes... the biggest meme is to just talk about light and darkness.
Aldus Larian (Jess): sure is
Bill: > hugs lamp
> even your shadows are in my love
Bill: ~~Also thirsty MC is also bae?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): if bad endings are bae then ya i guess
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean yea its funny but in context it would be pretty manipulative of her to try to take advantage of him since hes in a pit of despair
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is this what it looks like when I threaten people?
Bill: Out of context though it nice. Girls like sex too and all that. Though I'm usually trying to feel like Seven/V/Jumin rather than MC and MC wouldn't be thirsty if it were *me* so. I never choose those answers. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean i dont either, becuase i wouldnt either even being a girl who likes sex and all that
Aldus Larian (Jess): at least not when the mood is "my brother just tried to kidnap you and my entire life is a lie"
Aldus Larian (Jess): you're supposed be MC but part of playing the game is relating to the other person aswell so that you can understand them and help them through thier issues its really not a male vs female thing as much as just relating to people in general
Bill: mm... I've been thinking about relating to some of Rika too...
Bill: Which is, you know, great.
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think you're kinda supposed to relate to all of them? in some way. ive related to rika too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they all have different personalities so chances are you can relate to each of them in some way or another
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yoosung - can relate to being a stressed college student
Jaehee - can relate to being overworked
Zen - some people have family issues, usually not based on your looks, but for other reasons
Jumin - can relate to liking cats
Seven - can relate to liking memes (but also being horribly depressed inside)
Bill: V - filling the emptiness and lack of self love you feel by obsessing over another person until you ruin everything
Aldus Larian (Jess): they're all relatable for sure it really doesn't have anything to do with your gender or their gender when you get down to it
Aldus Larian (Jess): MC you ignorant slut
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmaoo
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Dr strange love
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb
El🆓de Faun (Tom): (that's the full title right?)
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i made that meme
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I thought so!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Just that linenin particular
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Reminded me
Bill: Wow I just a guy who had Sevens glasses. Totally Seven after he lets himself go working for C&R a decade.
Aldus Larian (Jess): they're gucci
Nokri (Marisa): ^^^^^^
Nokri (Marisa): That dude was loaded
