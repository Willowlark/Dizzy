Bill: Jaehee has cute selfies!
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: Raaaaaayyyyyy nooooooo
Bill: Lol
Bill: Mood
Bill: Ray: does this pot plant REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING?!
Bill: Wakes up early
Late leaving for Armonk cause mystic messenger catchup
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think you meant pottED plant <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: For about 10 seconds I thought the joke was something to do with the name Ed.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmaoooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): best version of that meme xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Me , when I get the the first MM email for the guest list:
Bill: Currently ignoring emails <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): that's such a bad idea tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): you need at least 16 for good end in another story
Nokri (Marisa): and the responses are based on how much time passes, so the later you answer them the longer you have to wait for a response
Bill: I’ll do it toniiiigjt
Nokri (Marisa): *they're waiting for your email*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Rika would have responding instantly
Bill: Fuck Rika.
Aldus Larian (Jess): V did <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): dont do that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yoosung wants to
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nznm6KyU_Eo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Hey girl with no eyes and the prude turtleneck*
Aldus Larian (Jess): i need to watch this but i canntttt D:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *You mean that psycho bitch who runs a cult? The one with the noodle hair who keeps trying to get in my pants?*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmaoooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wanna play Ray's route now xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm 40 seconds I'm and I can't contain myself 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm watchimg this in the fucking bathroom
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's the route!
Aldus Larian (Jess): "do you know me"
"Should I" 
"I always new you were the dumb twin"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "oh that knocking sounded awfully aggressive, and the music changed too"
Aldus Larian (Jess): the monotone voices make everything so much better
Aldus Larian (Jess): "I will end you, I am strong, hulk smash."
                              -Saeran Choi 2018
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "pass me that motherfucking elixir. bottoms up bitch. give me a fucking swirly straw too"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Give me a cloak, make it a turtle neck"
Bill: ~~Not sure if I forgot to buyback this Zen chat or Zen is just entirely capable of carrying a conversation about himself by himself~~
Nokri (Marisa): yes
Nokri (Marisa): many timrs
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): rays route such a damn trip
Aldus Larian (Jess): too bad they didnt put the taco song in there
Nokri (Marisa): gotta put up with just the lullaby
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): do you recommend Ray route before or after V?
Aldus Larian (Jess): canonically V comes first
Nokri (Marisa): bbbbbbbefore because ray is cool <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): true but also, ray
Bill: ~~V cause you throw V in the trash as soon as you play the Ray route apparently~~
Nokri (Marisa): v plays a big part in ray's route
Aldus Larian (Jess): if you want more twins angst, Ray if you want domestic violence angst, V
Bill: but you'll stop shipping V after Ray shows up.
Bill: ~~I still don't see it~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~ray for a good relatable time~~
**biru is bullying ray i saw the screenshots**
Bill: ~~I have one I didn't share yet cause it's your birthday~~
Bill: These another story chats are so much longer holy shit.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah
the original story ones take like 30 seconds
another story chats take like 30 minutes
Bill: Which is good ~~when V or Jumin is involved~~ but also annoying cause I *should be working lolol*
Nokri (Marisa): if you play zen/yoosung/jaehee they're gonna be super abrupt chats
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): i went from ray to jaehee and i was like WOW short
Bill: ~~oh this is a Ray chat rip I got excited when it had a Jumin story attached~~
Nokri (Marisa): ray! ray! ray! ray! ray!
Bill: Ray: V is a dirty secret keeper
MC: so where am I?
Ray: Can't tell you
MC: who owns this place?
Ray: Can't tell you
MC: Why can't I go downstairs?
Ray: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): v is choosing not to share by his own free will
ray will probably be murdered if he shares
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Look girl idk, I just work here. But also plz kiss me in the garden"
Aldus Larian (Jess): I felt so uninvovled in Vs route
Aldus Larian (Jess): like worse than sevens
Nokri (Marisa): yeah v's route is just kind of. sitting there watching him do his stuff until he's ready to be with you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): like when stuff goes really nuts
Bill: I'd say that's both, but I am still on common.
Aldus Larian (Jess): like at the end of vs route its like "oh youre still here?"
at the end of rays route its like "mc what do you think we should do?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Vs route is good , I just felt less important to the storyline i think?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!!
Bill: ~~well there's no fucking reason Ray should have contacted you anyway~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~thats any route tho~~
Nokri (Marisa): because *destiny*
Aldus Larian (Jess): anndddd he contacted you cuz rika told him too cuz she started a cult, becuase shes nuts, and V had her going to therapy but then she said "no wanna, i hate u" he was like "ok bb, go start a cult this is fine"
Aldus Larian (Jess): V and Ray are both problematic AF
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is there a different prologue bad ending in AS?
Bill: I was wondering that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or is there even a prologue?
Bill: There is.
Bill: It's.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: about as realistic as OS.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its basically the same
Bill: "Go to the place on the word of a total stranger and don't leave for two weeks"
"Okay"
Bill: Cept this time you're BLINDFOLDED
Nokri (Marisa): there are two bad prologue endings in another story. one is you get kidnapped and become a second Ray, the other is you report him to the police and go home to eat chicken
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): GO MC, you get dat chimken
Aldus Larian (Jess): in rays day 10 you can call him and tell him his girlfriends been kidnapped
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh how the turn tables
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh nvm its an incoming call
Nokri (Marisa): ye i think you pick up and are quiet and he's like "hewwoo??" and you can be like "it's me tehehe!" or "*pay $20,000 in 5 minutes or you'll never see her again"*
Aldus Larian (Jess): "but i dont even have any money"
Nokri (Marisa): evil tehehe
Aldus Larian (Jess): wawit you can do it to him twice it looks like damn, revenge time
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes like "did u kidnap yourself? <:lenny:395307171539189760> "
Nokri (Marisa): "i have an identical twin, surprise!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): then he asks if he should crash though the wall to save you bless chertiz
Aldus Larian (Jess): opp gotta make a meme
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jumin with the real truths over here
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does anyone know what seven says in his heart emoji? He says he loves something but idk what
Nokri (Marisa): he always says it so fast
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven reveal your secrets
Bill: I should finish the user stats feature for dizzy...
Bill: I could make a !heart command so you can give hearts ala MM for replies you like.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but you can just heart react?
Bill: ~~dizzy, did you mean MM rp assistant?~~
Bill: User stats would keep track of the hearts you’ve earned.
Aldus Larian (Jess): y tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can they be exchanged for hourglasses if you earn enough?
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Cause then Marisa will be buried in hearts and it’s quantitative evidence of love!
Bill: And cause I’m a dork and it sounds fun.
Aldus Larian (Jess): then only marisa needs the function!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): !heart mawisa
Bill: It’d be universal.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can they be color coded?
Bill: Not really as a generic tool.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😔
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Bill: With the update I could have it trigger via react on the message, or via command, or via like !❤️
Bill: Not sure how you’d color code it. Aside from the 5 heart colors in base emoji.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I want red or purple!
Bill: But how would that display...
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have no clue
Aldus Larian (Jess): i never use dizzy anyway
Bill: I guess if Marisa were to check her relationship meter she’d see “Jess: 💜x30” or the kind.
Bill: “That’d he almost as crazy as me being a replacement for someone’s cat”
Bill: 
Bill: Whenever 👏 Jumin 👏 and 👏 V 👏 talk 👏 it’s 👏 like 👏 I’m 👏 talking 👏 to 👏 myself
Bill: No shit Jumin.
Bill: She just wouldn’t have gotten with you V!
