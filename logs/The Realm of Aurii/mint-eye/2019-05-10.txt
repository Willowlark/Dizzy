Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea that was Savage
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven can be so savage
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's ok he goes off on Rika in Vs after end and it's amazing
Bill: V you edgy boi noooo
Bill: ~~I get what you‚Äôre doing~~ but no!
Aldus Larian (Jess): V is like a child trying to hide something 3 times the size of them behind his back
Bill: Das my boy!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Finished Secret End üò≠
Aldus Larian (Jess): How was it?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wild
Aldus Larian (Jess): Absolutely
Bill: V: makes everyone sad

Boi.
Bill: ~~what a mood~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAY
Bill: The chat after he says I‚Äôm gone?
Aldus Larian (Jess): How is that mood
Bill: Making people sad. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): You don't make people sad
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Who do you make sad?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Not us
Nokri (Marisa): OH i thought you meant the game was making people sad
Nokri (Marisa): wrong react
Nokri (Marisa): the idea of you making people sad was so ludicrous it didn't cross my mind
Bill: Wow I totally feel like I just fished for compliments.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Not my intention.
Bill: Just. Felt like mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nope
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I got the drunk call!
Aldus Larian (Jess): From Yoosung and zen?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Das a good one
Bill: It was!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): good shit
Bill: If. We‚Äôre not going to the party. And still chasing Saeran. Am. I on a bad end?
Aldus Larian (Jess): No! That's good üëç
Bill: I guess the secret ending are more ‚Äútying up huge plot loose ends we left‚Äù than bonus material.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Not incorrect!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Actually yeah it's basically continuation of Seven's ending but also tying up loose ends
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But it GOOD
Bill: I can do them tomorrow problem.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is tomorrow party day? or today?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea the secret ending is sevens after end basically
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's pretty important
Bill: Today.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven *does* have an actual after ending tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): forget if the Secret Ending unlocks after main story or after ending
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think the after end?
Aldus Larian (Jess): In therapy I guess you could just play the after end and ignore the last minute of it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah after end isn't that great
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wait but isn't the bed scene in the after end?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think you right...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I literally just watched it yesterday lol but I forget
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like that part
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they need to update the game because I'm tired of seeing the V proposing CG every time I launch the game lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea they either keep changing for 40 yrs or 2 days
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like it's been that since February? and then they changed it briefly for Zen's b-day
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~the rest of the AE is cute even if it's not real but then saeran is like "you must spend 500 hourglasses to unlock an semblance of true happiness"~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||oh yeah after end starts with bed scene where Seven suddenly is wearing a black dress shirt unbottoned||
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||then there's the "chat" where everyone's planning to go visit Saeyoung at his toy shop||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||yea! Which is a dream rip. And then people are like "oh saeran said in the game he isn't interested in women" and I'm like YEA cuz that was a dream seven was having about him "baby brother"||
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||that's the part that I didn't like because you're not even participating in the chat so it just draaaaags||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||ohhh yea I could see that. I didn't mind it but I can understand||
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||and then it just ends so if you're not paying attention you miss the end of it lol||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||everyone's happy! No reason to spend more. Money!||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||is the church cg in the after end too?||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||cuz that's a good one||
Bill: Y‚Äôall realize I spoiled most of this game for myself already right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea but likt
Aldus Larian (Jess): What if you forgot the spoilers
Aldus Larian (Jess): And we just remind you of them, then I'll feel bad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||there's a church CG?||
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||oh, that's normal ending||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||OH SHIT you right. It's good though||
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||I read the summary on the wiki and still sounds like a good ending lol||
Aldus Larian (Jess): ||yea the normal ending are usually still good||
Aldus Larian (Jess): I need to draw seven wearing this
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's just cringey enough for him to wear
Bill: It IS
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's too good üòÇ
Bill: Cute dream sequence.
Bill: *I like the ending*
Bill: Did party and after ending.
Bill: Sevens speech on the bed is beautiful.
Nokri (Marisa): youre probably not talking about the secret ending dream sequence are you
Nokri (Marisa): I
Bill: Excuse me imma go memorize that cause I get ALL those feelings and he put them into words way better than I could. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Secret endings will wait till later.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes talking about seven AE where at the end saeran is like "PSYCH"
Aldus Larian (Jess): part of the weight of his words is that he could literally die in the next few hours. tho
Bill: *I can feel the wuv tho*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE
Bill: I want da love man.
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHH I trying to find a specific art but i can't
