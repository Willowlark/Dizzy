Nokri (Marisa): ANIMAL CROSSING MYSTIC MESSENGER YEAH
Bill: Anyway yeah psychology woo.
Nokri (Marisa): Am waiting for the new game announcement still aaaaaaa
Bill: Make mint eye in animal crossing.
Bill: Aww I do wanna go back and save Ray.
Bill: Rika coming in as soon as I say “what if you come to the RFA” is hard core red flag.
Bill: ~~I mean, I know Rika is manipulating him but this is an in story example~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): shes like "say what bitch"
Bill: “Take your elixir honey”
Nokri (Marisa): should i see what the sims rfa are doing or should i do something useful <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Those are both useful things. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Dizzy: You should choose something else
Nokri (Marisa): !choose RFA sims, something else
Nokri (Marisa): ok
Dizzy: You should choose try to draw
Nokri (Marisa): !choose try to draw, work on cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): ok thanks dizzy
Aldus Larian (Jess): I suppory all those things
Nokri (Marisa): i support u
Nokri (Marisa): oh i'm gonna make a meme
Bill: So...
Bill: V...
Bill: Yeah okay I’m still lost in metaphors with why his and Rika’s relationship bombed.
Bill: Like. All this devil crap means something but I’m not quite there.
Bill: V cared about her too much, and rather than accepting...? her flaws he idolized her? And offered himself as a trade off, with all the abuse me stuff and what not?
Bill: What a trip.
Bill: Terribly confusing.
Nokri (Marisa): he accepted her flaws, that was kind of part of the idolizing issue. he thought everything about her was absolutely perfect rather than treating her like a normal person, and rika was used to being thrown away most of her life and couldn't handle that kind of adoration
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wack.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's complicated
Bill: Riiight I’m seeing that right now, he’s not actually thinking when he says “I love you even if you stab puppies”.
Bill: He’s so adoring, so altruistic?, Rika was like this can’t be real. Let me. test this.
Aldus Larian (Jess): V takes "unconditional love" to the next level
Nokri (Marisa): yeah it ain't healthy
Aldus Larian (Jess): But it's like not love
Bill: Yeaaaaah my boi needs a firm slap from Jumin.
Bill: But everything happened in secret.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's just idealizion and obsession and damn they all need help SOMEONE HELP THEM
Bill: Since Rika wore a mask with everyone else about her issues, V was the only one to know about the issues. If someone else was in the loop they’d realize the perfect couple that was being shown outwardly was not right.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well alot of people tend to keep their pure emotional selves to only those closest to them
Nokri (Marisa): they were both members of very high society, it'd be bad to let anyone else into their business for fear it would leak out and destroy their reputation
Aldus Larian (Jess): Esspecialy in Korean culture
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's like a big thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did you know Korean men arent supposed to cry at funerals?
Aldus Larian (Jess): But woman are expected too
Bill: It’s just the scenario, not a comment that they should or shouldn’t have shown those sides to friends.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea I wasn't taking as it
Bill: Also nitpick, but they often talk about “I love you right now and the future doesn’t matter even if it changes” and like. accepting change is a huge part of growing together?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn hippies
Bill: Oof. It wasn’t intentional by any means... but everything started with V.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Rika’s fucked up but.
Bill: I mean, it’s also bad luck that the two of them met.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's not like fully his fault or her fault they are just absolutely volitile together
Bill: But Vs “unconditional love” sets off Rikas illnesses, and his selflessness in trying to be with her anyway actually. Makes it worse.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ding ding ding
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also they started dating at like (estimated 16-17 ish?)
Aldus Larian (Jess): So like theyve have a long as time to fuck up shit together
Bill: V supporting her is one thing... but putting her first in EVERY scenario is too selfless. Like, no one should be okay with being blinded by a loved one.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like they're a way to accept your partner but not condone them
Bill: That’s EXACTLY it yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Crazy kids
Bill: Yeah he had like, no boundaries for himself.
Bill: And with Rikas brand of crazy... she took that to levels that *turn into thrilling visual novel routes*.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea which probably happened partially because of how lost he was in who HE truely was
Bill: He started to define himself via her!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Exactly
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good times yall
Bill: They talk in so much symbolism like I really want to understand their relationship and what it was but devils sun and stuff don’t make sense to me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's all metaphors
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did you happen to catch a part where Rika goes off on him for not trying to get her to sleep with him? And he's like "it's not like that?" Cuz I'm trying to remember where that's from
Bill: Nope. I just got a flash back of them in bed.
Bill: And they were quite happy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I know it's somewhere
Aldus Larian (Jess): I just gotta find it
Bill: Like the obsession bit I relate to, so it makes some sense. Her devil thing is... her bad/negative/destructive feelings and thoughts not feeling validated?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean I think it's normal to be somewhat obbsessive at first but that usually the part that wears off after a few months
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have obsessive tendencies too so like I get it but it lasting like that it not typical
Bill: Yeah, V is too far. There’s obsessiveness in one sense, but he’s putting the obsessing ahead of himself.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or healthy lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Esspecialy cuz they like lived together and everything like damn boi you literally think the sun shines out her ass
Bill: They say an addiction is an addiction when it negative affects your life and keep doing it. Ie an alcoholic goes to work drunk.
Bill: Vs obsessing was at the cost of his own health. And self identity but he had those issues before.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~And then for them to just pull the twins into their shit~~ <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Mm.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's like that couple who's like in Highschool and their like "hey let's have kids and live together and make our own little world for just you and me" and then they do that it's just terrible for everyone
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~like Tom's half brother~~
Bill: Oof lol
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: It’s something.
Bill: V’s a mess but understanding him is good.
Bill: FINALLY starts cleaning room like I said I would today

Aldus Larian (Jess): Awwww yeeee
Bill: Vandy the best. Cause he DOES NOT understand what’s going on and it hilarious.
Aldus Larian (Jess): If you don't compliment him he gets all "guess I'm not your type, like that guy with the blue hair, ugh"
Bill: ~~apparently blue hair is Vandy’s type~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: He keeps “eyeing” Vs hair color and asks if it natural.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Bill: Cosplaying Vanderwood would be a trip. The memes.
Bill: So many memes.
Bill: Vanderwood commenting on MC telling V to stop trying and fix everything himself, that it’s still him obsessing his great. “Oh that was a good dig” “nice one miss”.
Bill: 
Bill: V: “too hard, imma go get Rika to cut my hands off so I can’t paint again!”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Basically
Aldus Larian (Jess): the real most relatable thing about V is how he has no faith in his artistic ability and hides it from everyone cuz of his artist shame  and hoe he wanted to have a fine art career but settled for "more acceptable" yet still creative career. like wowie
Bill: Naaaah
Bill: 
Bill: Definitely most related.
Nokri (Marisa): are u on invisible

Bill: So I didn’t notice.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm gonna beat up a tree

Aldus Larian (Jess): I accidentally clicked into he answer that was like "well zens face does make the world a better place" and he was like 💔 "i understand, he's much more attractive than me, and not sketchy like me plus he can sing and act"
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
