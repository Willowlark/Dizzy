Aldus Larian (Jess): lol i always forget Rika was a Zen fan too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen "hey V thanks for saving my life how can i repay you??"
V: j"ust dont die or my gf's gonna be really sad"
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait... why is sevens calling card cheaper than anyone elses? his is 3.49 zen and jumin are 5.99 each jaehee and yoo sung are 4.99 each and ray and v are 6.99 for both
Aldus Larian (Jess): wack
Aldus Larian (Jess): i guess that technically makes v and ray the same as seven if u divide it in half
Nokri (Marisa): I think because he’s the most popular and the “canon” guy to end up with? So he’s cheaper or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): i would amuse hes be more expensive cuz of that
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe once people see how good seven’s chats are they’ll buy the rest <:thinku:543194478614413318> or it encourages them to buy all the seven related dlc
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo like the secret endings you mean?
Nokri (Marisa): Ye! Secret endings and Valentine’s Day
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo ye valentines day! i still havent done those
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
We gotta getchu some valentines dlc
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oooh Zen V-Day is :pepper:
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have 300+ hourglasses im trying to dave for rays after end whenever that becomes a thing
Nokri (Marisa): Zen’s birthday on the other hand is just a chaotic mess <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
