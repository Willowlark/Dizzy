N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw i go to share something to jess and jess is the one who reblogged it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): What was it 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jaehee Protection Squad™ 👕
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): That was so good
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ohhhh that makes sense
Aldus Larian (Jess): Biru prob knows that already but ya know
N🆗ri (Marisa): Reset theory confirmed
Bill: I didn’t actually.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YAAAS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Should be Zen though
N🆗ri (Marisa): isn't there already a canon image of zen doing that <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Where the canon image Marisa? 👀👀👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): the bad stuff is out of frame
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did he smoke during that scene? 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bad boi
Aldus Larian (Jess): He looks so cross eyed in that
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's hilarious
N🆗ri (Marisa): same pic feat jumin
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's trying to look at something on his nose
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen and V smoke, Saeran says he smokes in the secret end but it could have just been a lie
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz he's like "ya I gotta go out side to have a smoke <:lenny:395307171539189760> "
Aldus Larian (Jess): And sevens like "ok fam have fun" ~~like a dumbass~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): That was hilarious tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wanna play MM 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): live your dreams
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can't 😭 my stupid conworker always watchin me. ~~i do go to the bathroom alot as is tho~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): make him play too
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao he likes.... Sports
N🆗ri (Marisa): just like...................................................
uh. driver kim? idk does anyone in mm like sports
N🆗ri (Marisa): rip him i guess
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't think so 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jumin plays golf
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Badly
N🆗ri (Marisa): an athlete
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA my coworker likes golf
N🆗ri (Marisa): perfect
N🆗ri (Marisa): a match made in heaven
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yoosung is an e-athlete <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom was watching this thing about this like 17 yr old korean Tekken player who skipped all his classes to go to the tournament and his parents didn't knoe and I was like "o yoosung"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow a yoosung documentary
Aldus Larian (Jess): Right?
Bill: Day 8, Jumin: “hi Jaehee, I’m here. Jumin’s just being jumin and working all day.”
Day 8, Seven: “hi Jaehee, I’m here. Jumin’s just being Seven and working all day.”
N🆗ri (Marisa): jumin's just being seven <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Wow Yoosung coming in from being with that chat about his mom leaving and how she was sick.
Bill: My heartstrings.
Bill: Was a good chat.
Bill: I’ll talk to you about it later.
Bill: Also SERIOUSLY they don’t seem to understand that *leaving the building with a live bomb* is a good idea. I always thought MC was locked in.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but what about the next chat, you have to stay up for that
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's dangerous to leave the building because the bomb might explode if they leave
Bill: She’s not, they just. Seem to think party planning is worth the risk of death.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the bomb has feelings and gets lonely and blows up if mc leaves
Bill: No it blows up if Saeran enters.
Bill: I just.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my mystic messenger account is almost old enough to start preschool i'm so proud
Bill: Party planning == SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I believe the tropes page calls is "fridge logic"?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Why TF does the security system recognize saeran as an intruder anyway~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): boi isn't supposed to leave his room
N🆗ri (Marisa): he has work to do
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bit Rika tells him to leave! That's is his work!
Bill: Yeah it’s under fridge logic.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Man's just trying to do his job
Bill: Though less fridge and more “five seconds after it happens and you go Ooooh shiiiit what if they did”.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ugh I wanna replay sevens route so bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's tomorrow 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): Fuck
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna see if that chibi maker from recently can be used to make mm emotes
N🆗ri (Marisa): *do it*
Bill: Not enough variety in facial expressions.
Bill: For mm.
Bill: Imo.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it seems ok if photoshop would just load
Aldus Larian (Jess): That one chat in the April fool's dlc where you can call out unknown for leaving you in read was gold
N🆗ri (Marisa): gotta work on them effects and it's not the same as mm but it's similar
https://im4.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-4-102ed24e408f.gif
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ahhh cute
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~how tf did I even manage to get good end for the April fool's dlc~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): being pro
it took me like a million tries
Aldus Larian (Jess): I trolled like have the time and when unknown showed up on was like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): And then I continued to troll him also
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good times
Aldus Larian (Jess): 2 white haired Bois in a chatroom
N🆗ri (Marisa): Five deer apart
Bill: Ugh I wanna strangle Seven.
Bill: Seven: I can’t be happy 707 anymore
Seven: I can only be bitter and angry Saeyoung
Seven: and you can’t love Saeyoung. 

Lol mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I thought e doesn't tell you his name till like the very end? 😮
Bill: He was talking while MC was asleep.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA
Bill: I know it’s the trope with otome games, but MC in both Jumin and Sevens route just seems to content to do nothing, follow whatever orders the guy has, and compliment him all the while. So passive.
Bill: Both routes had following his lead but Sevens also has significant amounts of taking no for an answer and both taking no for an answer and being told what I can and can’t do are thing I am bad with. So I wanna kick seven, even if I understand his good intentions.
Aldus Larian (Jess): haha yeaaaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): she is passive idk she has like her own brand of strength? that prob makes no sense but yea
Aldus Larian (Jess): mc is like the voice of reason, she all cool calm and collected wile everyone else freaks out
Bill: I get it. She’s very strong in that she’s more focused on Sevens life problems than a bomb.
Bill: Tb give her credit, MC is better than any otome series I ever looked st.
Bill: Not that I can’t see myself saying some of the things Seven is in a similar scenario too, being overly protective and giving up on my wants cause it’s “better” for her.
Bill: 🤔
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like in rays route MC completely psychoanalyses him and is like "boi I know exactly whats going on there" and hes like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> "shit u right"
Bill: Ye she very insightful and emotionally intelligent.
Bill: That’s across all routes, and it coming off differently is a mark of just how insightful she is. Different people need different approaches.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i think shes pretty good granted she still has to feel blank enough to be "regular girL"
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~in another story u get to tell rika off man that shit is great~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): The games really funny if you think about it cuz MC doesn't technically see the backstory scenes
Bill: I dunno, it’s probably just the people around me but I don’t consider “passive, does what you say without question, and constantly supporting your every moment” regular girl.
Aldus Larian (Jess): no it isnt
Aldus Larian (Jess): but like its still the most relatable i think?
Bill: I don't find it so, but by this point in the game Seven and MC are supposed to be 'in a relationship' of some kind ~~*I guess this is talking in Korean haha*~~ and I'm comparing that to friendships.
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk. shes def not perfect but i find her relatable.
Bill: Maybe I'd see how that's more relatable comparing it to an actual relationship.
Aldus Larian (Jess): she also doesnt always do what tthey say?
Bill: Nope. The reason I say this now rather than during Jumin's route is in Jumin's route she's like "okay hon, I'm not getting in *a cage*."
Aldus Larian (Jess): like sevens telling her dont talk to me dont care about me dont try to get to me and she does. in rays route one of the route tips is litterally "do not be submissive"
Bill: Ye. and I'm not knocking her, I like her quite a bit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i find it more like silent strength? like "ok honey imma let you think u in control but we both know thats not what happening here"
Bill: yeeeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): especially with jumin and seven i feel tho. its been awhile since i did anyone route tho sept jaehee
Bill: I totally see that. I'm familiar with that, but yea, not something I've experienced.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and of course *its a game* so its under no obligation to be realistic and is basically a romance novel
Bill: mm. Lord knows how the *actual dating* part will ever work. This is just the spicy fun of the chase stuff.
Bill: thas why Horimiya was so good.
Bill: You got the dating part of the relationship.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't quote think there is a dating phase in mystic messenger. it goes from "who r u" to "we're destined soulmates" in 11 days and there's no dating
N🆗ri (Marisa): like sure they go on dates but they also are already basically married
Bill: that's what I mean.
Aldus Larian (Jess): what do u mean thats how it works right <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ya
N🆗ri (Marisa): just like irl
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea just like that!
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> <@!386874959009415170> https://www.dropbox.com/s/p94jd58b2gr740x/Mystic%20Messenger%20Original%20Sound%20Track.zip?dl=0 Mystic Messenger soundtrack. Finally went and found it.
Bill: ~~<@!301927856240459777> wouldn't want this though right~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just listen to it on Spotify
Aldus Larian (Jess): rip no another story
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Unless there's other songs?
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's available on youtube
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do i report someone for dropbox violations
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i listen to the main story soundtrack on spotify if i ever want to
Bill: what, I thought it wasn't on spotify.
Aldus Larian (Jess): main story is.
Aldus Larian (Jess): another story isnt
N🆗ri (Marisa): i remember someone sharing a spotify playlist of it yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): another story is where all the best song are tho aside from geniously hacked bebop
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://open.spotify.com/album/22TnaaEazIX4J3dhE8rJn0?si=Y2lh57p_SjGLwv_NxI2z1g
Aldus Larian (Jess): srsly considering buying the special believer package to legally own the soundtrack for AS and also that sweet sweet saeran backstory info
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you haven't played another story don't go looking up the soundtrack though because there's one song you gotta listen to in-context for the first time
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): *you know exactly what i'm talking about*
Aldus Larian (Jess): at 1:30am
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh THAT song?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!
N🆗ri (Marisa): that one song
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He are the toughest
N🆗ri (Marisa): sHHShDsffwm
N🆗ri (Marisa): sdhh
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Thou art the swolest
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): jSHhshDHhh
N🆗ri (Marisa): sh
Aldus Larian (Jess): you gonna make me choke on coffee
Bill: *YooSuNg you're so pure*
Bill: God he gets such a bad rap for his route, no one mentions he's the purest of bois in Seven and and Jumin's route.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes actually just the purest of bois
Aldus Larian (Jess): he gets a bad rap for rika but yoosung is a good boi ™
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's also the one with biggest yandere potential
Bill: “Women cant protect themselves duh”
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean...
Aldus Larian (Jess): ma doesnt have a great track record on protecting herself
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: you mean it's NOT a good idea to download random applications where unknown people tell you to enter apartments alone?
Bill: Hold on I gotta uh.
Bill: Call a cab.
Bill: MC "I like you cause I like you, I don't care about your problems" 

Me, crying in the club
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn yoosung is ripped in that pic
N🆗ri (Marisa): have you been staring at it the whole time <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): no lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was hiding from coworker
Aldus Larian (Jess): biru is this the hug scene?
Aldus Larian (Jess): good scene
Bill: Yup.
Bill: ~~I was just complaining about MC being a bit unrealistic but I'll take that hug~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): shes like "no u dumbass u dont get to choose whether i love u or not"
Bill: That's so nicceeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bonus points for it being Erik meme
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaoo
Bill: Me: "Maybe I should play visual novels, so I can pursue girls"
Me: *Looks at the maids, tsunderes, lolis, rich girls, and other generic VN trope girls that are one dimensional and fill a basic trope*
Me: "I'll stay with Mystic Messenger"
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): bang dream? 👀
Bill: Idols are some of the most generic trope girls there are.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but when combined with *another* trope you get a 2d girl <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): what about huniepop
N🆗ri (Marisa): or sakura wars i have that on the wii
Bill: Did seven just call me from across the room.
Bill: Guy's hopeless.
Bill: Zen, anytime a man is near MC: "MEN ARE WOLVES"
Also Zen: "Just look at my ab selfiess anytime babe 😉"
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg yeah you should call him sometimes too
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin does that too
Aldus Larian (Jess): or maybe thats an outgoing call i can remeber
Bill: Zen: "I trust Seven with my life, how could V hurt him like this"
Also Zen: "Seven could theoretically hurt you while he protects you MC are you sure you don't want to run away ~~into my abs~~?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): seven's emotionally unstable and zen's thinking seven will hurt her physically ~~and emotionally~~ which is valid
Bill: For the record, this is Zen growing on me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen forgets women also have sex drives and its hilarious
Bill: YEEEE
Bill: That's a thing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): TRUE
then again: 
Sen on Saeran route : "I have just met you, but i will risk my life for you, we will be good friends"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "We were enemies 2 days ago"
Bill: I really hope the Jaehee route has
Zen: "You and MC are spending alot of time together huh Jaehee"
Zen: "MC watch out that Jaehee? Totally wants to use you for *sex*"
Bill: Also Jaehee's theme is my favorite.
Bill: hmm. there was something else I wanted to wisecrack about in that chat, I can't remember tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen: "MC I have a boner now so you have to go home now or we might have sex"
MC: "I'm not seeing the issue here"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen: <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: crazy stuff.
Bill: 🇫
Aldus Larian (Jess): who the f for?
N🆗ri (Marisa): For everyone for have lewd intentions
Bill: me lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wot
Aldus Larian (Jess): what
Bill: V voice: "We'll talk about that later"
N🆗ri (Marisa): What time later
N🆗ri (Marisa): Reschedule now
Bill: "Sorry the signal is bad I
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): classic V
Bill: *Right*
Bill: Gotta up my V game and *run from everything*
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: I'm not trying to say anything, but FUCKING APPROVE of that gif.
Bill: I wanna rewatch that show.
Bill: That was *the most savage* 5 minute deconstruction in history.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Voice actress of the year award right there
Bill: Damnit my copy of that show was corrupted at some point.
Bill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHd3xfDzTg8
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://mystic-pen.tumblr.com/post/182561816820/yoosung-zen-jaehee-jumin-seven-jihyun-saeran
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone else please read these because they are midly entertaining
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive seen other ones that are mean but these are funny lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): don't ask another guy
Aldus Larian (Jess): "am baby"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I read them
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): im tryng to find a specific meme but yall are gonna get the rest while i intermediately look for it along with hiding from my coworker
Bill: hiss at him if he looks in your direction.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant tell if hes looking in my direction 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: I should have Dizzy do join part messages in this channel. So it can be like "Jess joined the channel" and be more RFA like. Maybe see if she can change the topic of the channel to the users who are logged in.
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/13010898/android/sticker.png;compress=true
Bill: But I need to update her API and doing more code on the old API is a mistake...
Aldus Larian (Jess): that would be kind of annoying tho
Bill: True!
Bill: *Authenticity though*
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz im on and off like every couple of mins
Bill: And Marisa would never be online.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *i would be if you let me rejoin*
Aldus Larian (Jess): like on a different account?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee
N🆗ri (Marisa): i had my status as online for like 2 minutes yesterday and chris immediately noticed
Bill: What... makes you think I wouldn't?
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA rejoin on new account so we can has u online!
Bill: You never asked.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i asked ages ago
N🆗ri (Marisa): when the problem first started persisting
Bill: Did you ask 'I want to do this because I'm *getting stalked online and won't **use the damn block button***'; or did you say "two accounts for memes woo"
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a bit hard now though because this account is tied to a lot of important channels i won't be able to rejoin
the first one, i said i could rejoin to be online on an account chris won't bother me on and you said it was too much hassle or too much something
N🆗ri (Marisa): you didn't want multiple accounts even though i would've left the server on one
Bill: Well whatever the explaintion was I misunderstood. I am all for you distancing yourself from your freaking stalker.
Bill: You could always *block* him though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm in 18 discord servers and he's in 3 of them
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wouldn't be able to use those 3 servers anymore
N🆗ri (Marisa): not like i do anyway right now because of him
N🆗ri (Marisa): but. i like them
N🆗ri (Marisa): look they renamed one "Beef and Tuesday" that's so cute
Bill: Blocking a user isn't the same as leaving a server...
N🆗ri (Marisa): even though i haven't chatted in ages they still include me in games <3
ok but it will cause drama
they'll notice i won't respond to their messages and call me out on it in the server
N🆗ri (Marisa): they'll continue to talk to me in the server
Bill: you'll be able to see those.
Bill: You can block DMs.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes exactly
Bill: Right, and you'll see the chats in the server still.
Aldus Larian (Jess): just let her rejoin yo
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes
Bill: Which you are already ignoring so?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't want to ignore the server though
Bill: Is there actually a difference?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like the people in the server
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes
Bill: You don't have to.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it'll go from "you have 6 new DMs!" to "hey @Jampire why aren't you responding to my dms? hey @jampire what do you think of this? hey @jampire what are you doing?"
(which are all totally normal questions, i just can't deal with 500 of them a day that's my issue)
N🆗ri (Marisa): borrach is a good person
they just talk sooo much and i can't keep up
Bill: Blocking prevents this guy from DMing you. If he talks at you on the server, you can still reply. There's nothing you can do about server messages. If you want to use the server and not deal with the guy, you have to either ghost him or not go on the server.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes now you know what i've been doing
Bill: You could at least suppress mentions from that server.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and that's why blocking him is pointless and will create unnecessary drama
N🆗ri (Marisa): but that's mean
Bill: *I don't care he's stalking and harassing you*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm already being mega mean by ignoring him
Bill: If they are mean, it's no longer bad to be mean to them.
Bill: But.
Bill: I will digress. If you did want to make another account, I'll absolutely give you an invite link for Aurii.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is there some way to have two discords open at once? it's a little late now
Bill: I don't think so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: ~~but if you're already ghosting those servers cause of the guy, does it really matter if you're in them?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah because they still talk to me
N🆗ri (Marisa): and i get updates from the server about things happening
N🆗ri (Marisa): two of them are gameshows
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're fun to watch
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's not just those servers. i'm in some important staff servers that they probably wouldn't reinvite me to because some of the people who run them are hard laced like that
N🆗ri (Marisa): plus i'd have to rejoin bne, genderbengers, and your photography one as well
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274> no win anymore
Bill: Whatever you decide to do.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i want to go online but i want to wait for chris to go offline 👀
Bill: Apparently blocking is a little stronger than discord makes it out to be.
N🆗ri (Marisa): look they remember me on the other site!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): they remember my jiggle
Bill: owo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The jiggle <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *what is this?*
N🆗ri (Marisa): epicmafia!
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's that game werewolf but online

N🆗ri (Marisa): no?
N🆗ri (Marisa): the demoman was murdertrain aretduyfi how did i not notice he was in this game aaaa i'm horribl
Aldus Larian (Jess): No
Aldus Larian (Jess): U nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): murdertrain gave me their detonator and died and i didn't even jiggle for them <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): PJ designs!
N🆗ri (Marisa): **PJ Designs!**
N🆗ri (Marisa): they all match :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
