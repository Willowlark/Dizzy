Aldus Larian (Jess): I made a meme to express my dilemma
Nokri (Marisa): ***do not***
Aldus Larian (Jess): how did I know you would say that?
Bill: ***do it***
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just found like 5 MM depression/self deprecation memes that have my cracking up but i feel like weve talked about depression enough today
Bill: naaah lampshading depression is fun, articles that are way too real are sad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok prepare for spam
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): its good my coworker isnt in here cuz i was dying
Bill: Oh no the Seven one's are mood.
Bill: turn back!
Aldus Larian (Jess): are you sure the other ones wouldn't be a mood if i put them on a picture of seven <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I was talking about the text though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i thought you were just biased
Aldus Larian (Jess): my fav is "i dont know what im feeling but theres alot of it"
thats a mood for me
Bill: I haven't another story but I definitely feel like Seven brand depression is more me than Ray brand Depression.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i feel like kurtis is seven brand of depression~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): its ok they both hate themselves. plus you havnt met ray yet hes not like unknown
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: Oh I see that.
Bill: bout Kurtis.
Bill: We'll see how much of a fit I really am for V, I jumped on the 'obsessive' part of things but I'm sure there's so much ~~worse~~ more.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ray is obsessive too ðŸŒˆ
Aldus Larian (Jess): plus seven doesnt actually self deprecate in canon all that much? or talk about being sad?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow the "loner who doesn't want to be alone" one hits hard
Aldus Larian (Jess): you not alone! we love you!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~unless you mean like psychically alone, we live very far apart ðŸ˜­ ~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Now that's a fucking mood
Bill: ~~Yo you pushing the Ray depression you already compare him to me or something?~~
Bill: XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah
Bill: Also gasp are you saying I self depreciate too much to be Seven? Well I guess that makes me a fuck up. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i still think you're most like jumin honestly, but i also think you compare yourself to character ALOT and its prob a bit unhealthy
Bill: I like people/characters like myself.
Bill: Though I uh. Don't want to be in route Jumin so.
Bill: hmm. Though Jumin's problems are more external stimuli than internal right?
Bill: None of it would have really happened if Sarah didn't show up?
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk he talks about his "tangled threads"
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think alot of it internal
Bill: The ~~cage~~ possessiveness and over protectiveness I suppose.
Bill: Hmm.
Bill: Now that've played two routes I definitely feel like Jumin didn't get the depth Seven did.
Bill: Seven had more content, so there's that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): V gets the same amount, Saeran likely will too
Bill: ye.
Aldus Larian (Jess): they didnt have the funds to makes everyone an extended route like seven at first. I wish they'd go back and do it for all the characters.
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumins a damn hero in V and Rays routes tho
Bill: he is in Seven's route too.
Bill: "Let me spend my money to protect you"
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA thats what he do!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~he gives saeran and mc an entire ISLAND in his normal ending~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): another story is lit
Aldus Larian (Jess): its such an emotional roller coaster
Bill: something something what about V.
Bill: But ditto, the other bois need full routes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): he drinks alot of wine in vs after end but he gets. shit. done.
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin is the voice of reason basically in vs after end while everyone else is running around screaming
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH and vandy
Aldus Larian (Jess): also voice of reason
Bill: ~~Jumin is the voice of reason in Seven's route too~~
Bill: GOD I love Vandy.
Bill: He's so just.
Aldus Larian (Jess): vanderwood route when
Bill: Not in the loop.
Bill: But hilariously so.
Bill: "Wait that dead chick from the RFA... isn't dead."

"Oh she has a cult too."

"wait the blue blind guy is a cultist?"

"Oh no wait he's just in love with the cultist."

"how many cults are your friends in?"

"what's this about your brother anyway?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): vanderwwod is a fucking star in Vs after end
Bill: I wondering how much I'll associate with V in reality, as opposed to when he's boiled down to 'obsessively in love' (that but to the tune of that Shrek 2 song). I kept zoning into his flashbacks in the secret endings looking for insight to my own mind.
Bill: ~~probably a bad idea but he gets better in his own route so it'll be fine~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): im mean hes still obsessively in love with her on like day 9?? soooo
Bill: ~~he gets better by his after end~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA he fix everything <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: And if that donâ€™t work:
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Vs route isnt "get V to love me" 
its "get V to not love Rika"
Bill: ~~relevant~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then mc just goes and flirts with vanderwood
Bill: Huh. I might like seeing characters go through scenarios and have traits I relate to because I like to gather opinions on a problem I'm dealing with, even internal ones.
Bill: insight!
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea remember that time you had to save that girl from that cult
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): Itâ€™s a new excuse every single time
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHY DID I DO THIS TO MYSELF
This scene was wholesome, it was so wholesome and now theres just a perfect opportunity for it to turn to sexytime. <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: DO IT
Bill: RAY NEED LOVIN
Aldus Larian (Jess): Its just staring me in face and its like "you dont want this cliffhanger"
Bill: let them fuck!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Saeran, having never once seen a naked woman: *"wat do?"*
Aldus Larian (Jess): *puts hands over eyes*
"MC you forgot to get dressed, its ok ill just keep my eyes closed"
Bill: * "MC you forgot to get dressed *again*"
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Do you want me to set a reminder for you to get dressed?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~oh no that brings up the dilemma of have they fucked before, or is this the first time.~~
Bill: *in anime everyone is a virgin or a slut*
Aldus Larian (Jess): MM isnt anime thanks
Bill: It it talks like anime, uses honorifics like anime, and has husbandos like anime... <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): welp
