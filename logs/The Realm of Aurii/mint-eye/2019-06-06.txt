Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: I wonder how often MC goes missing after the main story.
Bill: Like every month she gets kidnapped by some new party planning organization cause she HAS to accept every offer to "playtest" a "game" she gets.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bold of you to assume MCs respective boyfriend/girlfriend would let that happen
Bill: Bold of *you* to MC boy/girl friend can stop MC from wandering into random cults.
Bill: Her ability to attract pretty boi suitors is too strong.
Aldus Larian (Jess): But she allready got a boy/girl no sense in talking the chance anymore
Bill: *Would that stop a cultist with, as you proclaimed, no social knowledge due to being raised in the woods by a crazy bitch?*

Bill: Not to pick on ray but I live for MC wandering around accidentally getting kidnapped/locked in places so much the RFA wants to kill her.
