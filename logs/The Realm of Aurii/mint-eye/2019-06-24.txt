Nokri (Marisa): Oh
Is this because I got kicked from the mint eye server
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~theres a server?~~
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah I was kicked for inactivity, it’s a role play server
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH WAIT i got invite to a mint eye server on tumblr but i never clicked it
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA THAT
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!! That!
Nokri (Marisa): WOO
Nokri (Marisa): ~~you didn’t want to click on the random link from a stranger?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt know anything about it so i just ignored it lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA didnt MM teach you anything
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was like low key interested but if its just role play then w/e
Nokri (Marisa): It’s an RP server with someone as rika/the savior and 90% of the other characters are mentally ill teenage girls
It’s super culty in an irl way
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT WHHYYY
Aldus Larian (Jess): is there a V? or a Saeran?
Nokri (Marisa): The way everyone talks to the savior in the ooc chat and how everyone talks to each other as though stuff in the rp are real
I think there’s a ray, I don’t think there was a V. They had a rule about no spies.
Nokri (Marisa): I didn’t get access to the actual rp channel because I hadn’t made a character yet, just the ooc
Aldus Larian (Jess): how?? do you even?? ok w/e
Nokri (Marisa): I was kicked this morning and last I saw last night, one girl was apologizing for being unable to attend some ball they were organizing in the rp to welcome all the new members because she had real life stuff and everyone was like “oh well, make sure you attend the next one”
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTTFF
Nokri (Marisa): You have to swear an oath when you join, that’s separate from agreeing to the rules. It’s great.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT T HE FUCK
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i love mm but sometimes the fans scare me~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~why fandoms so scary?~~
Nokri (Marisa): Little isolated pockets of the internet are great and super messed up
Aldus Larian (Jess): welp, glad i didnt join XD
Nokri (Marisa): My main regret is not being able to view the role play channel to see what goes on in there
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~joins rp as seven but undercover, in drag~~
Nokri (Marisa): Like was it like Aurii where they make big posts, or is it mainly dialogue with occasional actions? Everyone had their name set to their character with no real names or usernames and they kept track of who never posted despite there being a lot of people so I’m thinking the latter
Aldus Larian (Jess): welp, i hope they have fun and uhhh dont take any drugs
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The mint juice
Aldus Larian (Jess): cant believe you got cleansed marisa
Nokri (Marisa): Minty fresh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Disolve gum in water
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Boom
Aldus Larian (Jess): its just mouthwash
Nokri (Marisa): Meanwhile other servers are like
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol was gonna say, that's just listerine
Aldus Larian (Jess): discord is a scary place
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👅 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): The original Mystic Messenger 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also one of those dudes is Chris Evans
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's it that's the whole game
