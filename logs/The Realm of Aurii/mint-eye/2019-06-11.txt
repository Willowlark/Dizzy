Aldus Larian (Jess): "while I study abroad" mhmm sure...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unless my lip syncing was just bad in the beginning
Nokri (Fopdoodle): noOO your lip sync is on point!!! it looks perfect on my end but i'll check again tomorrow
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's like only the very beginning for me
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like my first part is a tiny bit off but then everything else is fine
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also all my annoyed looks are acting so plz don't think they are actually directed at you cuz damn I look like an ASSHOLE 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): We did gud Mawisa! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's already perfect ❤
Nokri (Marisa): i was checking my youtube account just now and it has 0 videos and almost 500 subscribers what is this
Nokri (Marisa): my other account has 100 subscribers but over 100k in video views *what is this*
Nokri (Marisa): screams into the 2011 void
Nokri (Marisa): THIS ONE TOO
HOW MANY YOUTUBE ACCOUNTS DO I HAVE AND WHAT'S WITH THE SUBSCRIBERS
Aldus Larian (Jess): Post post post <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>  I didn't get to check it again cuz I still haven't got to lunch but I'm sure it's fine
Nokri (Marisa): EAT LUNCH ARE THEY STARVING YOU???
Nokri (Marisa): i'll post it around 6pm, prime tumblr time
Aldus Larian (Jess): I ate lunch I just didn't take a break cuz there's a meeting in 2 mins
Nokri (Marisa): frick there's a frame where you can see the bed i have to re-render it
Nokri (Marisa): OK i had to save it like 5 more times and one of the video files somehow ended up being 23 gigabytes BUT it's now queued to post at 5:30
Nokri (Marisa): i'm considering posting it to instagram but i don't know how to get the video on there, and also it might be too big <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think Insta limits video to like a minute? or minute and a half?
Nokri (Marisa): ooo yeah this is over double that rip
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but you might be able to post the full thing if you separate it into sections and then do a multipost
Nokri (Marisa): oo i wouldn't want to take up people's timelines that much and annoy them ;u;
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no like, I think you can post multiple videos in the same post
Aldus Larian (Jess): POST YAY! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
