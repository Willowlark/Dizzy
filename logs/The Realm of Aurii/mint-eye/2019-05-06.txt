Aldus Larian (Jess): For 600 hourglasses
Bill: I love how they all use their statuses to be passive aggressive to each other.
Aldus Larian (Jess): In another story you get V hearts for support other members of the RFA lol
Bill: V you selfless boi.
Bill: Fucking hell I answered the 20 emails before sleeping and now my phone won’t stop buzzing from responses.

Bill: <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: I mean my answers are prescripted but.
Bill: *if I say I feel a particular way it’s cause I do and if you disagree doesn’t change my feelings*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ha haha buckle up kiddo
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Same energy
Bill: LOL
N🆗ri (Marisa): meanwhile jess is holding a gun in the mirror

Aldus Larian (Jess): Life imitates art that imitates art
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are Thier slippers a fruits basket reference?<:minathink:544567715931750405>
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0 !!
i don't think so? <:thinku:543194478614413318> maybe?
it's a Yotsubato reference lets check their slippers <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Bill: Ye that look like yotsuba.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh idk what that is
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmmm no they're wearing sneakers
Aldus Larian (Jess): Double reference?
N🆗ri (Marisa): we gotta go deeper
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I've seen a Taiyang/Yang/Ruby version of that post
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it cute
Bill: Zen: wow Seven is really depressed huh
Zen: enough about that tho
Zen: my abs are fantastic in this photo aren’t they?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg I have 3 of these hacking emails this morning at work and I'm cracking up cuz the first one is like 
"Hey your account was really easy to hack, please change your password so other people can't do what I did 🌸"
And the next was like "You should probably chose harder passwords 👀"
And the last is like "Change your password right the moment!  😠"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's the most Ray vs. Unknown vs Suit Saeran shit i seen
Bill: From gender bend ave there group, since spoilers are apparently free range now I said I replaced Instagram on my apps drawer mystic messenger.
Bill: I’m not disappointed.
Bill: Seven's route: where all your friends ship you openly and freely with their other friend
Bill: 
Bill: I love Jumin.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i love that part XD
Bill: He was *really* all over the place in his own route, but him without the *massive possessive streak* is a lot of fun.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cheritz is doing a children's day art event today through the 20th and I kinda wanna participate but I've never drawn a child
Bill: Draw Marisa.
Bill: Same thing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol it has to be an MM character
Bill: ~~Marisa is Ray what you talking about~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~but Ray was a personality created by saeran at the age of 19 and was never a child~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): DRAW THE TWINS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): BREAK HEARTS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or draw kiddo Jumin and V
Aldus Larian (Jess): How do I child?
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHH I want to
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): big head, smol body
Aldus Larian (Jess): But scare
Bill: *I was walking into work earlier and I was like “I really should get a pet I can direct my affections towards” and I realized that would just make me rich, possessive, easily jealous, controlling, AND misplacing my emotions towards an animal.*
Aldus Larian (Jess): i want to draw all the babies
Bill: Oh it's window breaking day *nice*.
Bill: I wonder if any after end has Jaehee getting Zen.
Aldus Larian (Jess): na
Bill: I mean, she's either bi or a lesbian if her own route is taken into account, and doesn't realize it (I think)... But she does have quite the crush so it sad it doesn't go anywhere.
Bill: if she's bi, rather than lesbean.
Bill: Not that I could picture them actually together though lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jaehee doesn’t like zen that way, she’s his fan 🎏
N🆗ri (Marisa): Her main route is also pretty platonic, in routes she ends up romantically with MC like the Christmas one it’s usually MC making the moves?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think shes bi? cuz like she mentions having experience but i cant remeber if she says its with men specifically
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive only done her main route but it feels super platonic
Bill: ~~they're only friends duh~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): basically in korea its illegal to CONFIRM anything as gay but cheritz has heavily hinted obviously that jaehee is gay or bi and also hinted that seven is also bi in the RFA collectors package i think?
N🆗ri (Marisa): The original route was platonic because Cheritz didn’t want to rock the boat too much and YEAH that
Bill: yeah I remember.
Bill: Her being a fan of Zen is a big part of her general routes so... I just wondered if they ever gave the relationship a shot.
Aldus Larian (Jess): seven "jokingly" hits on the boys all the time
Bill: The series as whole doesn't really focus on the relationship, more the chase. Which is typical.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah. her route made me ship them a bit tho
Bill: Ye. I can't imagine it myself, but gotta respect the feelings.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and rays route gave me jaehee/seven vibes with the "damn boi nice arms" thing and the taco song. but main story jaehee finds seven annoying so rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo heres what it says in the book about seven being bi if anyone was interested
Bill: lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jaehee/Seven is more viable than Jaehee/Zen hehe
Bill: Zen x Zen when.
Aldus Larian (Jess): rays ultimate after end: is him with MC and seven with jaehee
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s just a whole shipload of workaholics
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG MC would have her hands full with "yall gotta eat and sleep"
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Just five more hours. Then I’ll take a 15 minute break.”
Bill: Tangentially, Zen's growing on me, with the way he acts when things are serious, but his *overwhelming ~~narcissism~~ self confidence* in casual conversation is just so much.
Bill: ~~although maybe I'm a little jealous of it~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): if it makes you feel any better its all a farce <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: oh no that doesn't at all.
Bill: Let happy people be happy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bold of you to assume anyone in MM is happy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Captain America’s school pep talks but it’s Zen instead
Bill: god you right.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHHH 😭
Elfriede Faun (Tom): SPACE
Aldus Larian (Jess): him teach
N🆗ri (Marisa): That looks like a scene from Hanako-kun aaaaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): All the parallels between Seven and Hanako are coming to light
Aldus Larian (Jess): "hacking for dummies" is on the floor lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): now I'm curious what honey butter chips blended with Dr. Pepper tastes like
N🆗ri (Marisa): Death
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like the conspiracy lines in the back
Aldus Larian (Jess): same energy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Cinematic parallels
Bill: Fixed it.
Aldus Larian (Jess):

Yoosung: wow sure wish Sherlock Holmes was here. 
Yoosung: ...
Yoosung: so while you’re stuck not exploding, wanna invite him to the party?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): MC: Yeah sure!
Bill: If you have time to update your status, maybe you should drive faster.
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe hes stuck in traffic
