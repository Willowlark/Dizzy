Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I want to art that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yaaaas
Bill: This dumbass saying “Seven got the coordinates” like V didn’t encrypt them himself.
Bill: They’re talking about marriage... Jumin you lock MC in your ~~cage~~ penthouse without a thought to her family.
Aldus Larian (Jess): RFA to V:
Bill: Why does Rika let me keep texting her enemies, discussing how we’re going to free myself and V from her cult.
Bill: Rika.
Bill: That’s dumb.
Nokri (Marisa): because she wants you to join her of your own accord
Aldus Larian (Jess): And she wants you to convince the retbif the RFA to eventually come to mint eye too right?
Nokri (Marisa): yee!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeee so she doesn't exactly see them as "enemies"
Aldus Larian (Jess): In fact I'm pretty sure she still calls them her friends
Nokri (Marisa): i think so yeah? she doesn't hate them, she just thinks they're 'lost'
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea. Even Ray says he's fine with everyone else except for seven and V and hopes they all come to mint eye and live happily ever after ✨
Bill: Too tired to continue.
Bill: Started nodding off in a flashback.
Nokri (Marisa): but u gotta continue
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whooo. Did u meet Vs mom yet
Bill: I mean she’s been in the last few days of flashbacks.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yay <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: V just invited her to go to a gallery or something cause Jumin said to form your own opinions about people.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did u get the V baby cg yet?
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He a duck
Aldus Larian (Jess): I really like how it just looks like sevens like "hey bro I know you wrecked your shirt but chips will fix it"
Nokri (Marisa): use chip to scoop up ice cream
Aldus Larian (Jess): Life hack
Bill: You sound high Jumin.
Bill: Hmm. I think I read one of Rikas rants as she feels V loving her unconditionally makes her feel owned? Not independent?
Bill: I’m not sure whose crazy that is, Rika for misconstruing support as possession or V for her being right.
Bill: If you don’t know what it is don’t use it, idiots.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's the mental illness <:pew:543202259085950996>  (for Rika comment)
Bill: Yeah. But V also said he didn’t love her in his elixir haze, he was obsessed with her. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeet
Bill: Ahaha.
Bill: Ray you have no friends! How!
Bill: So I know you’ve praised the writers for their detail work in writing psychological illnesses...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Bill: They uh. Take ALOT of artistic liberties with the “hacking”.
Bill: And the app.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea
Bill: Basically all the tech stuff.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I know
Bill: It’s pretty cringe sometimes.
Bill: Seven putting admins commands into the app chat direct like?
Bill: Aaaaahh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Im already in danger guy whats a little more.
Bill: *loud cheering*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Semi doctor
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Of
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Course
Bill: Huzzah!
Bill: I am caught up!
Bill: It took two and a half hours!
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: Constant mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~seven I've played your route I know who saeran is just go save him damnit~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did u get to the v and Rika let's go talk in the woods part yet
Bill: V still recovering from elixir OD.
Bill: I REAAAAAALLLLLLY hope Saeran joins a chat with Seven, uses his emote, and Seven is just like WHAT.
Bill: I want the stupid emoji to be the big reveal.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao sorry boi
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think by this point seven kinda knows he's just in denial?
Bill: I could see that.
Bill: Yesterday some 14 year olds asked me and Leanna if we wanted to join a “flower cult” and I just said “I’m not drinking any elixir”.
Bill: They didn’t get it or probably hear me.
Bill: But I thought I was hilarious.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think by the time you reach the cabin sevens figured it out. Did he see him? I can't remember
Bill: Nope. V asked “did you see the hacker”.
Bill: Which isn’t suspicious at all.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmfao
Bill: Did they kick Seven from the messenger?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awww ye here we go!
Bill: “Another story characters only sorry”
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): How about
Bill: Gay.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sept it's when he's all anger boi
Bill: Anger gay
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~its still gay but dont tell him~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mc: "saeran did you boot everyone from the chat so we could be alone" <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
Saeran: "why TF would I wanna be alone with YOU"
Mc: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Seven, in a bad Saeran cosplay: “let me into another story messenger, I’m totally... Ra...Ryan? Ryan yeah.”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah his name changes to saeran when he switches
Bill: I’m getting that yeah.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: More moods.
Bill: Oh that chat was something.
Bill: So much yikes.
Bill: Wish V could be a *bit* less metaphorical about “refusing to accept her darkness”.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:rise:557579163511554050>
Bill: Me @ mystic messenger
Bill: ~~Vs the one~~
Bill: Oh fuck I read the signature as Rika
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm out with me friend and her 1.5 year old and she started pulling on my 707 pin.
Me: "that's a pin!"
Her: "pin,pin!"
Me: "yea good job!"
Her: *pullss again* "who's that"
Me: "his name's Seven"
Her: "pretty!"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Pretty!
Nokri (Marisa): They grow up so fast
Aldus Larian (Jess): Fast learner 😂
Bill: V falling apart now that he doesn’t have secrets to keep and it’s still mood.
Bill: *as I say that* they asspull and say elixir withdrawal gives depression.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol I don't remember that.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nice 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean that is a drug withdrawal symptom but like Vs already depressed  si
Bill: Yeah I liked that. That he finally lost control and just.
Bill: Lost it.
Bill: I relate lol
Bill: So like I don’t want the elixir to be the reason for it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What are day 9, 10?
Nokri (Marisa): ye what the day?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does MC ever take the elixer? <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Nokri (Marisa): in bad endings 💃
Bill: 8?
Bill: 8. V back on his bullshit too cause Seven asked if he knew the hacker and V was like “nnnnnnoooooo?????”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol then why is seven like "aw mc you worry about v first?" Like yea bro I didn't get drugged
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: Lol
Bill: Shit I’m on the wrong route.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I get resume playing tonight 🎉
Aldus Larian (Jess): If I can stay up past midnight
Bill: I have like... half a dozen V screenshots of things I’m waaaay to familiar with feeling, and that was just one chat.
Bill: This game is oof.
Bill: Also I’m starting to see the cracks in Rika’s opinions. She’s still being played as a victim (or trying to be seen that way rather) but lines of manipulation are making their way through.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777>
Aldus Larian (Jess): You mean you didn't see that in sevens route
Bill: True she was bat shit in the end of that.
Bill: I guess in terms of her and V.
Bill: Cause all day the chats have been he said she said.
Aldus Larian (Jess): they even hint at it in jumins route
Aldus Larian (Jess): rika *knows* jumin has a crush on her and shes like "oh ahah hehe what if i had ended up with you instead of V" in a flashback
Aldus Larian (Jess): and jumin is "please dont joke about that"
Bill: Hmm. I saw that as showing how loyal Jumin is to his friend V.
Aldus Larian (Jess): it did, but it also showed that she not nice
Bill: Hmm...
Bill: I didn’t read that much into the statement.
Bill: I wonder if that’s odd of me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean just cuz you read it differently than i didnt doesnt mean tis odd
Bill: I suppose yeah.
Bill: It’s just a what if.
Bill: Like... Georgia’s mom thinking we were married.
Bill: It’s funny because it doesn’t compute to you or I.
Bill: Or Tom for that matter lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Georgia's mom isnt one of closest friends tho XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): like V Rika and Jumin were pretty close as a triad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and Rikas whole thing is like "people person" i just the she knew that and wanted too see his reaction
Aldus Larian (Jess): but dat just me
Bill: But even if you said that, I’d write it off in the same way entirely because we’re so close. I know you love Tom, and the idea to doubt just. Wouldn’t work.
Bill: So like. Jumin is so secure in Rika and V are hella gay that he treats it as a simple statement.
Bill: I TOTALLY see how she could be fishing for answers of course.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but he got defensive
Bill: Mmm... that’s true.
Bill: I probably should replay jumin, I was so behind on chats I guess they’re a blur and I didn’t really connect with him in the moment.
