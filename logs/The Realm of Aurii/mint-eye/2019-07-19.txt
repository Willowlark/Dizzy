Bill: *fruit by the foot is illegal?*
Aldus Larian (Jess): *quits cosplay forever*
Aldus Larian (Jess): But also:
*Whinny saeran voice* "get outta my room!"
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs the face of someone who was just trying to look up marinated chicken recipes and messed up the computer big time by falling for a ‚Äúcongrats! You‚Äôre the millionth visitor!‚Äù pop up.
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): He sneaks into saerans room to use his computer and fucks everything up and then calld seven for help

Aldus Larian (Jess): https://han-jumins.tumblr.com/post/186330705356/kasiona-never-prank-zen-like-that-for-your-own
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm honestly really excited to cosplay Zen. I've wanted to for a while and I think I'd have more fun than as Jumin
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA Zen's great! all your selfies will be canon
Aldus Larian (Jess): you can channel all his self confidence <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I love Jumin, but his outfit is pretty generic unless you really notice the pocket square and the cat. Also not having a good with and using my brown hair didn't help
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea zens pretty recognizable I'd say?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik):

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you might know who she is lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): OwO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's amaranthinebunny. She's kind of part of the New England crew. She's the one who did our Marauder photos at Katsu
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I initially followed her for her Blake
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but apparently she's MM trash as well
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yo she super cute
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I ~~creeped~~ scrolled through her older posts and she did a few MM coslpays
Bill: Hella dude you make this shoot happen.
Bill: *tHiS cOuLd Be YoU*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~should I invite her to do MM with us at CCE?~~

Bill: *Like Jess before Ray* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~inb4 she comes to the mystic messenger shoot and promptly goes to war with stanning Zen versus Ray~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Me?!
Bill: Zen was your first MM love right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea but I wouldn't get into a war over it
Bill: Oh no, not saying anyone in particular.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): MC has *two hands*
Bill: What. are you implying there with that?
Bill: My thought was she showed up and it was the V fangirl from last year, but I realized that make no sense cause she Zen fangirl.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): for *holding hands* obviously
Bill: <:rated_lewd:391242351198339093>
Bill: That's basically sex ~~in rwby~~.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Plus she has pics with seven and saeran too
Bill: It's just a joke.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she also cosplayed Zen and Jumin... like, not publicly I don't think... but they were still good too
Aldus Larian (Jess): All MM Bois are worthy of stanning <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> just not the the point of fighting with other fans
Aldus Larian (Jess): I saw Zen!
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wanna follow but I don't want to look suspicious
Aldus Larian (Jess): WAIT
Aldus Larian (Jess): I forgot the most important question
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is she single?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:itisamystery:601092590368063523>
Aldus Larian (Jess): We must dig deeper
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Not sure honestly. I think last I knew she was? We're friends on Facebook but she deactivated her account
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I *think* she was? ~~last time I creeped on her profile for that exact reason~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nice :dab:
Bill: Could always ask Will or something. üëÄ
Bill: unrelated
Bill: Run with it anyway. Set it up, chat about your mutual love of Zen, share progress, and when you get to CCE then chill. If it works out, you follow up.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Talk to her about how happy zen looks in the new title screen~~
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Lmao that sounds like a business deal
Aldus Larian (Jess): Make her a PowerPoint on your best traits
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > opens MM
> got signed out
> has to remember which email I linked
> gets it on the first try
> gets 30 hg for the anniversary
> has a bunch of notifications because I forgot I started a new game weeks ago
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oops
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): on the plus side, I'll get to experience a bad end <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tell me all about it I'm too chicken to get bad ends
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ugh.... have to go through aaaaaaall of the chat
Aldus Larian (Jess): you can reset without having to get an end
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I want the end tho~~
