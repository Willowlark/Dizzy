Glonk: Gotta find that meme tom sent before, it would be perfect right now for your flight
Glonk: Can't find, ideally you do the adult thing and leave for the airport now and wait for your flight.
Aldus Larian (Jess): My cousin keeps complaining he's having twins cuz he already had 3 kids and I'm like "if only there was something you could have done that would have prevented this <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> "
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You know what they say
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Abstinence makes the heart grow stronger
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Or.. maybe they don't say that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is that what they say? Shit.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow so I'm kind of pissed at myself now because I was trying to hard to find a later flight out tonight so I wouldn't have to miss too much work and my boss comes in asking "So what time are you leaving? Like, noon?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so like... I probably could have gotten an earlier flight -_-
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and gotten out of work earlier
Aldus Larian (Jess): shiiiiit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could have gotten to Milwaukee earlier and actually like, relax for a bit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm basically going to be checking into my hotel around midnight, going immediately to sleep, to wake up, shower, get breakfast, print my boarding passes, and check out before going to the expo for a few hours, and then going back to the airport
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not really much of a trip, but hey, company is paying for it
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh damn üò¶
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA! and no work tomorrow
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's why I'd like to do the MillerCoors tour üòì
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have about 6 hours from the time the expo starts and when I need to start heading back to the airport and I think the tour might be like, an hour long?
Aldus Larian (Jess): you could prob knock out the expo pretty quick if u wanted
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If I see all that I want to see by like noon, I think I could make it work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.electricalwireshow.com/wp-content/uploads/files/pdfs/expo-wire-floor-plan.pdf
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can blow through that in a couple hours
Aldus Larian (Jess): you said they only wanted you to hit up 3 booths right?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but there's other I'll probably hit up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because we use their stuff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have no idea really what to expect. Could get bored quickly, could get super absorbed by some kind of robot thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn those botths are cheap af
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the expo is free to register so I'm guessing they have a shit ton of money to be able to put on this expo so cheaply
NüÜóri (Marisa): Insidejdndjw abstinence makes the heart  grow stronger gkdixnxcjsvwidbwisn
did you mean absence makes the heart grow fonder 
that first one is absolute art though
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I MEANT WHAT I SAID
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and he said what he meant
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Tom is faithful 100 percent
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea definitely
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
NüÜóri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Glonk: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooo my gosh I realized what always subliminally made me suspicious of chocowaffo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I never realized til today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs cause she doesn‚Äôt have established friends she cosplays with
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs just her and Stephen
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk how long she‚Äôs been cosplaying but she never posts pics with other people unless she hopped in them kinda spur of the moment
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean it‚Äôs been at least a year since last RTX and she doesn‚Äôt seem to have any reoccurring cosplay friends
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk if that‚Äôs judgey but I find it odd
NüÜóri (Marisa): People she cosplays with, or just people who cosplay in general that she hangs out with?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she's pretty active in that massive Messenger group
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but everyone in that group is scattered across the US
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): As in, she doesn‚Äôt seem to post pics with anyone except Stephen
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She's kind of a loner. I think the only cosplayer local to her is echoblaze
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So she doesn't really have the established group that we do or the NY crew or the New England crew
NüÜóri (Marisa): Maybe she posts them in her stories when she sees people? my page is 99% posts of just me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is there just that few cosplayers in Colorado?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she probably only sees people at cons but also wants to spend most of the time with Stephen
Bill: What Georgia means is Choco doesn't seem to have a group of friend in the cosplay community she hangs out with. The assumption from that is that people don't want to be around her, be it because of drama, because of personality, coincidence... It makes her question why people aren't around her, and doing things with her, cause most people share their interests with their friends. 

Which also means, cause I know what you're thinking, it doesn't at all apply to you Marisa. It's not about the posts, it about the activity it shows. You post stories and such with us and are often *with* us. You aren't in that category Marisa.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah bill picked up what I‚Äôm throwing down
NüÜóri (Marisa): no too late i understood but also relate to the situation :3c
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): in the RWBY community, those are the only two I know of. I'm sure there's more but they don't seem as relevant in the RWBY cosplay community we're familiar with
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye mawisa you have friends tag you
NüÜóri (Marisa): Even before I posted pictures with you guys I was alone most of the time but I knew people. There were always groups of people I *could* meet up with at any time, though we weren‚Äôt cosplaying the same series so we usually never got pictures together. It‚Äôs possible that‚Äôs true for chocowaffle as well, or it could be that she is alone. ü§∑
NüÜóri (Marisa): Oooo other people tagging her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Chocowaffos tags are people just seeing her at con it seems
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i made this funny pic but it won‚Äôt send ahh_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ok like these are Marisa‚Äôs tagged pics, clearly she is loved
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess it could be chalked up to Colorado being more sparse in cosplayers
NüÜóri (Marisa): Oops I thought I erased those in my tagged section lol rip
<:woah:543194447345876998> that is a lot of pictures
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Instagram only shows cosplay content starting January 2018 so not very long
Aldus Larian (Jess): we stan marisa
NüÜóri (Marisa): I kin pocket lint
NüÜóri (Marisa): Why is everyone doing story quizzes today omg they‚Äôre really fun but also super difficult
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Because we all carry you with us üíï
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ik im pretty slick when I sleep enough
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My guess is she's relatively new to cosplay and sees these cosplayers she looks up to and wants to be on their level, hence the try-hard vibe she throws off. There probably aren't that many serious cosplayers in her area so she probably doesn't know a lot of people too personally to call a friend group. She met Stephen and got engaged and so when she goes to cons, he's the person she spends most time with.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): All good points
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just feel like I see The Good Hoomans‚Ñ¢Ô∏è absorbed into friend groups pretty quickly
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I hadn‚Äôt considered that Colorado might have a very different cosplay culture
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): As I said, she's active in that messenger chat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's a big state
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): With a less dense population ye
NüÜóri (Marisa): Midwest states are freaky
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is Colorado Midwest? I thought it was west
NüÜóri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Colorado's total population is about 5.6 million whereas NJ is 8.9 million
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and almost 12 times larger in area
NüÜóri (Marisa): And probably less anime fans who go to cons
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): CO = 52 people/sq mi
NJ = 1210 people/sq mi
Aldus Larian (Jess): and less cons
NüÜóri (Marisa): meanwhile tokyo has 16,095 people per square mile and you're making friends at a con whether you want to or not
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Truuu less cons too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thsee tru facts, I hadn‚Äôt considered these factors
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Myth_busted_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, just scheduled a tour for that apartment complex
Aldus Larian (Jess): nice!
Aldus Larian (Jess): when?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Friday!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm gonna clarify my questions and get total costs and stuff to see if it's doable
Aldus Larian (Jess): awesome! good luck ma dude
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she said utilities are not included in the rent so I would be responsible for those as well
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea utilities are hard to find included, but sometimes you'll find water and/or trash are but others are not
Aldus Larian (Jess): so def clarify
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I wanna ask about if by "cable ready" and "internet access" if that's included because that would be something that would be nice not to have to worry about
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she said I would pay electric to PP&L and water, sewer, and trash to them so I guess it would be hard to gauge cost since it's paid by usage
NüÜóri (Marisa): ask your friend because bills are weird
we have two sewer bills for some reason
NüÜóri (Marisa): one to the township and one to the state or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ugh my coworker doesn't even take his full 30 min for lunch
NüÜóri (Marisa): truly dedicated to work
Aldus Larian (Jess): then he eats at his desk
NüÜóri (Marisa): oh no
NüÜóri (Marisa): related to a story i shared in another server
```half my family was associated with mafia and would literally poison people
my father didn't believe his mom was trying to poison my mother
she would send leftovers to the house marked "JUST FOR [mother's name]" and my mother refused to eat them
one day he got fed up of her "wasting food" and ate it himself. my mother took my sister and I out of the house for a few hours because she knew it'd be nasty. came back like 4 hours later and he was gloating on the front porch when it suddenly hit him and he was toilet bound for three days```

we think my father may be poisoning people now because everyone who gets close to him dies. all of his roomates since the divorce and a few of his ex girlfriends all wound up dead.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats terrifying
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what the fuck holy shit
NüÜóri (Marisa): from what i've heard they weren't mafia themselves but they were known to harbor mafia members who were hiding
NüÜóri (Marisa): o ye i think erik and leanna joined after i explained stuff?
my family gets a bit messed up in parts. when my parents were getting divorced my father would break into the house in the middle of the night and just stand in my room, or try to run us over and stuff. fun times.
is this what they call yandere
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yikes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I remember you talking about the mafia and poisoning parts before
NüÜóri (Marisa): none of them are invited to my party <:pew:543202259085950996>
the biggest headache would be my aunt linda's drug addicted son
supposedly he's never awake during the day and so won't show up, but sometimes linda drags him along to events. he regularly overdoses and gets hospitalized like once a week. they've offered him so much free help, all wasted tax dollars.
he asked me for a phone number once over the phone and as i was telling it to him he was carving it into the sidewalk with a pocket knife because he didn't have a pen <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): well... better the sidewalk than like, his skin or something...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ugh what a crappy day i just dont wanna do anything
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): which is bad cause its finals week
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im really bummed about running around trying to get research
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and im not even super into the one i interviewed for yesterday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): theres a woman who sometimes takes researchers, im wondering if i should email her to ask about research or try to catch her in her office and ask
NüÜóri (Marisa): that sound like a good idea
Aldus Larian (Jess): putting fanfic to read infront of the book im supposed to be proof reading is the adult version of reading a book behind a text book. somethings never change
NüÜóri (Marisa): biru, hunter's not in the photography group so it won't tag him <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): the guy who writes our manuals has a masters in education but doesn't know the difference between "then" and "than"
Aldus Larian (Jess): who
NüÜóri (Marisa): **how**
NüÜóri (Marisa): my classmates weren‚Äôt even native English speakers and could differentiate them perfectly
He has no excuse
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have no idea
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh boy now i get to message some RNC member about "getting in contact with the president" on facebook üôÑ
Aldus Larian (Jess): (company facebook not my facebook)
NüÜóri (Marisa): Mistah pwesident
Aldus Larian (Jess): legit coversation i just had
Me "just move the text box"
her: "how do i do that"
me: <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Mistah Twump pwease..."*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmfao
Aldus Larian (Jess): to yesterday i figured out my office mate doesnt work al the time but unlike a normal person he does goof off on his phone or anything he just... does... nothing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): .....h....how
Aldus Larian (Jess): he just sits there
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im floored
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how is that possible
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats so....how isnt his brain like begging for stimulus
Aldus Larian (Jess): Right? I have no idea but I hate it cuz I just feel like he's watching me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whata weird guy wtf
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I hate it lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): He also has really immature humor from what I've seen?
Bill: ... Next time someone is motivated to say something showing concern for me like 'we'll grill you later', please don't if you don't intend to do it. 'Are you okay' and actions of going out of one's way for me is a priceless thing to me because it means I'm being seen, understood, and cared about which was not always the case in my friendships and it's a feeling I still crave. 

For the statement to go out and have it not followed up on is the exact opposite feeling, like I don't matter, you don't care, and it's just empty words. I don't believe that was the intention behind the statement and it's a silly thing to be bothered by I'm sure, but it does dig pretty deep into insecurities I have.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's probably because it seemed like you disappeared
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): wait what? did i miss something?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's from the chat in ooc
NüÜóri (Marisa): Oo
<@!184437198865563648> you haven‚Äôt been around today to grill
How we supposed to grill someone who‚Äôs not here <:rise:557579163511554050>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And they were mad at you for behaving in a way that seemed immature and then dipping.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It was just a misunderstanding
Bill: I apologized (though I may not have used the word sorry, bad habit) for that in the chat.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah, they just wanted to talk about it more but you left.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Arguing isn't a bad thing.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): As long as it's not all the time
NüÜóri (Marisa): grill time. everyone get out your desired bbq foodstuffs.

1.) in what way was üçø misconstrued? we're over here scratching our heads at why that may be offensive so if you can explain why it made you feel bad we'll be sure to avoid similar misunderstandings in the future

2.) what's got you depressed? your behavior this week is very concerning
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~ok i DID miss something, woops im sorry~~
Bill: You didn't really Leanna.
NüÜóri (Marisa): 3.) are you avoiding my questions <:lenny:395307171539189760> or are you thinking about them earnestly
NüÜóri (Marisa): 4.) hey <@!184437198865563648> whatcha doin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 1.) I'm sorry if the popcorn thing made you feel some type of way. I genuinely was just interested in what Jess was posting about her character. It was me showing that I was basically lurking in the chat waiting for what she was writing next.

2.) I agree with Marisa in that you've been really off lately and we genuinely *are* concerned about you
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I believe it was just misconstrued as watching him struggle with what Jess was saying
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh shit I didn't even think that it might have come off that way. I'm sorry üò¨
Aldus Larian (Jess): We are all concerned, you've just been pretty quite, not to mention on invisible. which sends mixed messages about wanting to be contacted
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh re-reading it I see how it could have been misconstrued that way
Bill: As stated I misconstrued the popcorn like Erik was waiting for a punchline Jess was leading me towards. That was my mistake, sorry about that, and it was being overly sensitive, I'm not *that* bad at being the butt of a joke (I think). 

Yes I'm avoiding the question, because part of what's got me in a funk is I can talk about things all I want, throwing my ~~first world~~ problems at everyone and nothing changes. I try and change them, nothing. I'm waiting for when everyone realizes I'm generally depressing and doesn't want me around. *Or just keeps me around for hotel bookings and photoshoots which is worse,* but you guys aren't that kind of people.

Working.
Bill: I merged 2 and 3. Is that cheating?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Def not, were all perfectly capable of getting hotels on our own.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I mean having free photoshoots IS a blessing of course, but it's not the reason no.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Friendship isn't worth 50 bucks ya know what I mean
Elfriede Faun (Tom): We'd just buy photoshoots if that were the case
Bill: the addendum is I don't believe any of you are the type of people to use someone like that, you know.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah but confirmation doesn't hurt
Bill: no, no it doesn't.
Bill: You got me there.
NüÜóri (Marisa): not cheating

if you all miraculously keep me around for some unknown reason there's no conceivable reason to get rid of you. i cry myself to sleep at night and have a suicide plan. if anything i've learned that the people in aurii are the most accepting people ever with the patience and homeliness of saints. you aren't being depressing, you're just being confusing because we have no idea what's going on.

you can talk about your problems all you want because it will change our perception of the issue and allow us to understand what's wrong. talking might also help you sort out your thoughts and see things in a new light. we're probably going to offer opinions, that's unavoidable because talking is a good way to waste time. you probably won't like those opinions, but you don't have to. they're just a way to see how other people view your circumstances. and they aren't intended to be offensive. aurii is a safe space otherwise we wouldn't be able to have conversations about the social ramifications of blackface and cannibalism.
NüÜóri (Marisa): that's my opinion owo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa that was eloquent af. Yea seriously just vent it out. More people means more opinions but talking it out is good. Keeping it all bottled up in your head is no good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): agreed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Conversely, if anyone has any issues with your behavior they prob should vent it as well. It doesn't do anyone any good creating a rift.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also Marisa I had no idea about you and I'm 1-day shipping you a lot of love, so be on the lookout for when it arrives
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH BOY
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): instead of a dmoinoes order button we need to have a love-shipping button to sent to anyone who needs it
NüÜóri (Marisa): thank u i shall forward it to biru with the power of the US Postal System <:pew:543202259085950996>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): PLEASE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): one click and that person gets a blast of love delivered straight to them

If it was new issues that'd be fine. I've had the same complaints about life for years, they're relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, I've done things to solve them which have not worked out, am still doing things to try and work it out, and I have no control over my emotions anymore so I'm just stuck in an endless loop. 

The same broken record, over and over. That's why I say it's going to annoy till you leave and why I'm so personally *sick* of the whole damn process.

NüÜóri (Marisa): i'm gonna aggressively smother you in cat dolls and head pats if u don't start venting to us
NüÜóri (Marisa): ***share your feelings***
NüÜóri (Marisa): but the knife is candy or something
Bill: my bleeding out says otherwise.
NüÜóri (Marisa): that's just red chocolate from this chocolate knife
NüÜóri (Marisa): or you can do the alternative. you continue to keep it to yourself, everyone in aurii gets continually more confused. if you do bring something up we won't understand at all, and it will cause rifts until aurii is destroyed and we all migrate to different social groups üò≠
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): there's something i want to share with you bill but i gotta wait til you see endgame. but it's really important to this conversation so just let us know the second you finish the movie and ill deliver you the goods
Bill: It better be a meme.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it is
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The Goods‚Ñ¢
Bill: Ah, the suffering of having to hold back a meme.
NüÜóri (Marisa): i wanna be stabbed in the teeth with a chocolate knife
Bill: Weird flex.
Bill: Like I said Marisa, I don't want to go into it, at the moment, anymore than i have. I've said my piece, and that covered what I did want to say. There's nothing new, or exciting, just some variant of feelings I've already had that I can't put into words at the moment. Which is the other part of why I don't want to vent, I don't know what to vent about other than "feelings suck". 

Wait I guess I just did it. Feelings suck, woohoo.

NüÜóri (Marisa): a travesty
Bill: Yeah no, the regular expression will only match a particularl pattern. In this case 

`Dizzy Trigger``headpat` `mention/username`

where `Dizzy Trigger` is `Dizzy, ` or `!`.
Bill: If there's stuff after the mention, it fails to match the pattern.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Damn you miss a lotta convo while studying
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao sure do üòÇ
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AHHH I CHANGED MY JEYBOARD TO BLUE WHAT
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AGHHHHH

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Fantastic
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nice
Aldus Larian (Jess): Y'all ever like. 
Hold your body to some crazy ass standard and like you find yourself not that great but you know if someone else showed up with the same body you'd be like "wow great!" But because you are you it's just not ok?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sorry I'm having some body image issues and just wanted to see if I'm nuts
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh same
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok cool. Not crazy. You look amazing tho!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so do YOU
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Y'all are beautiful üíï
Bill: Totally valid. I‚Äôm not in position to compare to others tho cause imma lose so I don‚Äôt do the same lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): I bought this strappy body suit thing cuz I thought it was really cute but it like hugs my hip and makes my SKIN stick out between 2 of the straps and I'm just like "ew gross"
Aldus Larian (Jess): But like I know that's dumb? I know other people don't find that unattractive? Im just like irrational
NüÜóri (Marisa): Oh yeah a lot of my costumes do that
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs photoshop and body shapers for unrealistic standards <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I just... Wanted to feel good in it

Bill: I know it‚Äôs terrible.
Bill: Beauty is suffering.
Bill: It‚Äôs a curse you have to bear. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's just frustrating. I should be proud of my body but instead I'm sitting here crying about it
Bill: üò≠
Bill: Nothing says you have to always fee happy about it.
Bill: Like when Jen and Gabon do the dessert thing, Just cause you are objectively attractive and your friends thing so doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt have a day you hate your own skin.
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I want to feel happy about it. I just feel stupid for buying something and not realizing it was going to a accentuate a part of myself I don't like. And I bought it twice cuz it's non returnable and the first was too smal
Bill: Disappointment is a bitch. üò≠
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do. Not. Want.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk I'll try it in again. When my expectations arnt so high
Bill: Clearly it‚Äôs the outfits fault though.
Bill: Oh good idea. Look at the parts of you that you do like when you do.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm holding myself to unrealistic standards
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I have extra skin. I've gotta getnober it
Bill: Sakimi üëè doesn‚Äôt üëè understand üëè real üëè bodies
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't worry, she's not my standard üòÇ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Extra skin is better than like,,, an extra eye
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): üåà optimism üåà
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean it makes my but look amazing so that's cool
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *positives!* <:pew:543202259085950996>
