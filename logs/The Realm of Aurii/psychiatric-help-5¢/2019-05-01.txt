NüÜóri (Marisa): Oh, you mean Nora?
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Next time Jess pays a Nora pic, someone should be like OMG YOU'RE LIKE IRL NORA!
Bill: Let‚Äôs not before choco tries to murder Jess.
Bill: Also unfollow her.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Walks into work
> Co-worker immediately comes up to me "Hey buddy, I need you to do a bunch of shit for me today" (verbatim)
> "Ok, *let me get settle first*"
> Congrats buddy. You made my shit list for today
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Office mate hasn't achieved the level of "don't give a fuck" that I have he's all stressed out cuz my boss isn't here and he has questions and it's stressin me out cuz he's all huffy and frustrated
Bill: He young?
Aldus Larian (Jess): 23
Aldus Larian (Jess): he just hasnt been here long enough
Bill: first job stress maybe?
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah hed had another office sales job
Bill: like, non retail job?
Bill: ooooh.
NüÜóri (Marisa): 23 is a bit late for a first job
o ye
Aldus Larian (Jess): everything here is simultaneously really important and not a priority and its hard to get used to
Aldus Larian (Jess): My boss is MIA üòÇ
Aldus Larian (Jess): His wife doesn't even know where he is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): But the garage door was open when she left and his trunk was open so that's concerning (?)
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe he died
Bill: ~~maybe he's dead~~
Bill: Oh okay I'm not the only one who thought that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes fallen/passed out before
Aldus Larian (Jess): there havin a hush hush family talk in the kitchen rn
Bill: üëÄ
NüÜóri (Marisa): üëÄ
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh boiii
Aldus Larian (Jess): it says something about their marriage that she saw the open door and trunk and just thought "oh well"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): she said "maybe he got kidnapped"
Aldus Larian (Jess): like holy shit XD
NüÜóri (Marisa): Highly desirable bossman
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn hes here
Bill: damn.
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe i earn brownie point for asking where he was and causing his family to panic
Bill: "none of your damn business, damn nosy women constantly having to gossip and chitter chatter back in my day they stayed in the kitchen"
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/13010904/android/sticker.png;compress=true
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah he said thanks for worrying actually
Bill: oh wow.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Speaking of Anna and Pasquale I feel so bad thinkin bout how she was like ‚Äúyeah he‚Äôs not forever boi‚Äù
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause he dealt with a lot of craziness at Katsu
Bill: She said that?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah when he left the room
Bill: Like, legitimately or like ‚Äúhaha cause me and Mag gay‚Äù.
Bill: Cause I had a lot of respect for him, he‚Äôs a good guy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Legitiy
Bill: Highlight that comes to mind is dancing with her even when he clearly wasn‚Äôt into it. He took interest cause it made her happy.
Bill: Wow.
Bill: I‚Äôm no longer worried about Anna for Katsu.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean it wasn‚Äôt in a jerky way
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They had very different future goals
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She‚Äôs willing to go anywhere for work and he won‚Äôt leave Long Island at any cost
Bill: Ah. That‚Äôs a bit better.
Bill: He‚Äôs a good guy. I don‚Äôt know the depths of the relationship so I can‚Äôt say it actually should be long term, but at the least I know he‚Äôs a good man.
Bill: And I‚Äôd hope Anna sees that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "he's not forever boi" as in she knows they're not gonna be together forever?
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò¶
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I mean I think they‚Äôre just havin fun and enjoying each other‚Äôs company
Aldus Larian (Jess): shes made a few offhand comments about him in that same fashion
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I get it, I wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice nasa for Noah
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean, tbh im on the same page with anna though. it's good to know where youre at, and she expressed similar feelings at ice skating when pas was there
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think they are on the same page
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd still feel shitty if I knew my girlfriend was saying things like that.... but that's just me
Aldus Larian (Jess): as long as they are on the same page i guess its ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): but if he doesnt know then id feel bad
Bill: =/
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im jaded, ya'll probably have the correct feelings on the matter
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same sentiment
Bill: If he doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm not happy about it, if he does I don‚Äôt understand it.
Bill: Well. I guess. Suppose it‚Äôs better than them being alone.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sometimes you just wanna enjoy someone else even if you both know youre not suited to be together the rest of your lives
Bill: But they also are committing to something they both assume is doomed to fail so that‚Äôs... wasted time?
Aldus Larian (Jess): people date casually it perfectly fine just as long as they both know the deal ‚Ñ¢
Bill: Haha yes. Enjoying someone else who cares about you is something alright.
Bill: God feelings/love is bullshit. People do stupid things all the time. Hopefully just more stupid good than stupid bad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): just cause people dont stay together doesnt mean its "wasted time" or a "failure"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): especially if both people are agreed on the "not forever" thing  i think
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean..... tbh.. just because of being jaded from life. I tend to look at all relationships as  "not forever" until its discussed that its serious
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i, personally, am upfront about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i cant speak for anna
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hot take: enjoying spending time with a person doesn't necessarily mean you have to be dating ü§∑
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): def not
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless im dating all of you. shit.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and if it's just that plus maybe to occasional sexy time, isn't that just FWB?
Bill: no we're married.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i guess? i mean obviously there's feelings involved for them which is why im guessing they are exclusive
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~except with Mag~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Id prob have a different view if i was still dating. its hard for me to imagine my perspective on starting new relationships.
Bill: I just... fall too hard for what they're doing I guess.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm sure if I were in their situation it would be harder for me to think about it than how I am now. Like, right now, logically, if I don''t see an end in sight, it makes sense to just not be together. But when you're actually involved and have those feelings, the feelings can make you think otherwise
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Leanna you ain‚Äôt jaded I agree with you lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): For me the end goal is getting married and if I don't see that happening, I'd rather not waste either of our time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which is why getting back into dating is hard for me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because there have been plenty of girls who have been interested in me, but for one reason or another I just couldn't see us working out so I'd rather not pursue it
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea me too (big surprise) but i know alot of people arent interested in marriage or ready for it or consider it a "goal" at all
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): valid
Bill: mm.... Less about marriage but more about the commitment behind it though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): basically my whole perspective on everything it just "you do you, as long as all parties involved are agreed, and no ones getting fooled"
Bill: Yeah. I'm not going to hold it against Anna *if* Pasq is on board.
Bill: if not, she's stringing him along and that I'll judge.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think he knows
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, i used to have marriage as my goal, and would look at relationships as a means to get to that goal. But, my ideals have since changed drastically. I don't think i value marriage as much as a lot of other people do and would be fine never getting married. 

But, I really like to get to know people on a personal level that only comes from relationships. 
When i'm in a relationship i'm committed to them, not cheating or any garbage. But, i also am upfront when i begin a relationship about how I'm there to have a good time and if it lasts forever then great, but if it doesnt for whatever reasons then thats fine. 

It seems like Anna is similar. But, obviously I cant really say if shes been open with pasq or not. I just hope she has been.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They had this look when they were talking about Long Island
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the way she talks when hes around though makes me believe he knows
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and that hes just happy to have the time with her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah that sounds right
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats totally valid
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They‚Äôve been dating two years it must‚Äôve come up
Bill: Love is totally different for everyone yeah. Which to parrot Jess, to each their own.
Bill: You can't tell someone they're loving wrong. ~~rip Casey~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooooff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): **o o f**
Aldus Larian (Jess): love and let love, peace and no war ‚òÆ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /Raises hand but ethan tho?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): War is ok then?
Bill: ha. Well, there's no rules in love and war.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ethan will prob self destruct eventually
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theres SOME rules
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~like dont abuse your partner~~
Bill: ~~but is that love~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~to people who arent aware theyre doing it , yes. still isnt right though. theres some rules~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): leanna bring the big truths
Bill: ah fair, my assumption is they knew they were doing it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): most abusers dont know
Aldus Larian (Jess): most abusers dont? from what ive gathered
Bill: I couldn't tell you. I just know the Anna and Pasq thing doesn't line up with my definition of love (to me it's... wanting to be with them in every experience and moment, wanting their happiness as much as your own, knowing that thick and thin you'll always be better with them) which is why it's jarring to hear about. They're definitions are just different. I just hope it doesn't hurt anyone involved.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): People have different priorities
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Relationships are of probably third or fourth importance to me
Bill: tis what I said.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): L
Bill: L
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): L
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I didn‚Äôt mean to send L y‚Äôall suck
