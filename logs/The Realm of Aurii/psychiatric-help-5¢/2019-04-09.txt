Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ..... anyone know what the tea is with nathanial? Because him and melissa (accentkisses) went to some weeb concert together.... and I thought he was the reason she and her fiance broke up and now I'm confused and curious
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he apologized to literally everyone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): me included
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho i didnt feel particularly wronged
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And everyone forgave him I guess?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was angryjigglypuff that did all that shit wasn't it?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye that was what came to light
Bill: Southern rwbyies are a mess.
Bill: why do people only ever want to get India and Japanese food.
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz it good
Bill: I barely eat food as it is, like, don't make it *harder*.
N🆗ri (Marisa): おいしい
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if my bosses go out to eat, it's either Thai or seafood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they took me out for Thai after my first week....
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: Like.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): was not a fan
Bill: Why does no one want to get a pizza.
Bill: Ever.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof yea my old boss took me for Thai food on my first day and i was really not into it
Bill: Like it's awkward to refuse but. I ain't only eating meat and cheese for fun.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I also didn't know how to eat it so I was just eating straight up curry. My boss goes, "You know, people typically pour that *over* the rice"
N🆗ri (Marisa): why not eat more 🇺🇸**AMERICAN**🇺🇸 food
N🆗ri (Marisa): *you ate curry without rice???*
N🆗ri (Marisa): how?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ??
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): to be fair i also didnt know how to eat curry when i had it the first time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the rice came on the side so I thought it was a side dish 😭
Bill: Fuck if I want to risk some random guess at a keto food being coated in a sugary glaze from india like.
Bill: ~~if I were to blow it I'd rather do it on breakfast or pizza hut anyway~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): do they know your on a special diet?
Bill: Yeah, and they don't hold it against me.
Bill: I just hate to refuse the kindness.
Aldus Larian (Jess): alot of times they have just meat dishes like shikabobs and stuff
Bill: in who knows what sauce or glaze with india food, and then take into account I'm already a picky eater...
Bill: It just not worth the stress.
Bill: ughhhh
Bill: team lead comes out of meeting: "So we going out for lunch?"
team: *nods and affirmations*
team lead: "Did you invite Bill?"
me: *once again repeats there's nothing I can eat on diet*
team lead: "aaaah"
Bill: oof.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mood
Bill: I hate armonk man, I could have skipped coming today.
N🆗ri (Marisa): woter

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😘 👌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nah, gotta garnish it with parsley 😎👉👉
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shit you right
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do a nice little water drizzle on the plate
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *yummmm*
N🆗ri (Marisa): gourmet ice is a real kind of ice
Aldus Larian (Jess): ya'll are savage
N🆗ri (Marisa): gotta have some variety. gourmet ice will get expensive over time so supplement it with cubes and flakes as filler
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ice nuggets are my shit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): choking on crescent ice is my shit
N🆗ri (Marisa): crescent is the hardest to scoop out of the cup
N🆗ri (Marisa): i imagine a server sets a glass of water down in front of y'all and you inhale sharply, do that smile-grimance that's really common among middle and upper class white folk, and go "yeah... scuse me. can you take this back? i wanted a glass with nugget/crescent ice and this is clearly *cube* ice...."
N🆗ri (Marisa): and then they're like "sorry we only have cube ice"
"do you KNOW who we ARE? is karl here? no? well karl is going to hear about this"
N🆗ri (Marisa): and the server is just like ~~who's karl~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is the face
N🆗ri (Marisa): anyway tldr after the year-long court battle between you and the server someone publishes a book called "ice to meet you: the horrors of bussing" and it becomes  a new york times best seller
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i went on that rant about how much i hate sald the other week, but now ive been eating it pretty regularly and suddenly i dont dslike it anymore.... i actually quite like it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): weird

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yo salad is dope if it has the good shit
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And refreshing

Elfriede Faun (Tom): The good shit yo
N🆗ri (Marisa): the salad god heard u and got offended
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you right
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they were like "i heard you talkin shit"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I got the salad from Panera with the chicken and fruit in it with lemon poppyseed dressing and it was actually pretty good? I'm not usually big on salad either
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i still slather it in dressing but.... i'm sure its better than eating shitty food from quickcheck every day at lunch~~
Bill: Well Jing said I’m visibly losing weight. ☺️
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm picky with dressing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same erik
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my go-to at home is zesty Italian
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I honey mustard too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and raspberry viniagrette
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i tend to go for vinaigrettes or like.. thousand island
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sometimes ceasar
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but not all the time cause its ..so MUCH
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG im so fucking tired of people who BRAG constantly
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no
Aldus Larian (Jess): its work related so no big deal i just fucking cant
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it mr hateshiswife
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ofc

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also I'm a basalmic boi
Aldus Larian (Jess): literally never shuts up about how great he is, his hobbies are, his job as an *educator* (not teacher he will fight you* was, how smart he is, how good his car is, how good his internet is
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And how bad his relationship is
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Like it's a good thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): like SHUT THE FUCK UP
Aldus Larian (Jess): he asked "is your internet slow?" (he asks this literally everyday, yea, its slow, our work has century link)

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that guy needs to seriously stop talking
Aldus Larian (Jess): so hes like "WELL IVE BEEN WAITING THREE MINS, I HAVE REAL INTERNET AT HOME, DONT BE A SMART ALEC"
Aldus Larian (Jess): so i roll my eyes
Aldus Larian (Jess): so then he yells "I SEE YOU ROLLING YOUR EYES"
Aldus Larian (Jess): like yea bitch cuz your being ridiculous
Bill: *wow* what a dick.
Aldus Larian (Jess): our internet sucks, get used to it or quit, you literally NEVER shut up about ho you dont need this job so LEAVE
N🆗ri (Marisa): he has real internet. not the fake internet at work that relies on mice and wheels to operate.
Aldus Larian (Jess): he was like "I HAVE FIBER AT MY HOUSE"
and i said "ok, good for you?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): be like "i have fiber right here in my desk" and pull out a pack of raisins or something
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): just go big or go home and just outright poop on his desk
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "here's your fiber right here, fucker"
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh shit XD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You have fiber too tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just because it's slow as shit doesn't mean it's not fiber
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think it is tho?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It could be cable although I'm pretty sure most areas even simple.areas use mostly fiber now
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I at least know for certain that service electric is fiber
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But century Link IS something special
Aldus Larian (Jess): true
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Regaurdless he's a dick
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He acts like it's "your internet" when he fucking works there too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Like you belong to the company but he doesnt
Aldus Larian (Jess): YUP
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz "you need this job and i dont"
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes gonna get fired soon enough tho so w/e
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes on personal calls legit everyday for hours
Aldus Larian (Jess): bills yelled at hime a few times
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow good job biru
Bill: I aim to please.
N🆗ri (Marisa): if he keeps complaining about the internet, change his default mouse to the loading mouse
N🆗ri (Marisa): so it looks like everything is always loading
Bill: ~~actually genius idea though~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): opp now hes bragging about buying things from home depot
Aldus Larian (Jess): or more like NOT buying things from home depot cuz hes too good for it
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wow. A Lowe’s shopper.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s inadvertently admitting his life isn’t perfect because his house needs repairing or updating in some way and thus is not up to his standards. It’s a cry for help.
Bill: savage.
Bill: "Huh, Liyang never answered that question I sent her"
opens her DMs to ask her
"Oh it's cause I forgot to ask her"
Aldus Larian (Jess): now hes telling me how he wants to put someone through a wood chipper
Aldus Larian (Jess): if i go missing you guys know what happened
Bill: https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=bose+quietcomfort&qid=1554830664&s=gateway&sr=8-3
Bill: People stop talking to you it's great.
Aldus Larian (Jess): no they done XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): they just get mad im not answering and then make fun of me for my giant headphones
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _talking to the professor was helpful but oh my god agida_
Bill: You say that every time. You say their salary and they want to help you silly.
Bill: I am fixing something that *no one* knows about on the team it's used for.
Bill: I just.
Bill: Am terribly confused.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my sister called earlier because she was hungry but didn't want to pay for food so she called me asking if bojo was around to treat everyone to the chinese buffet
i offered to pay to spend some time with her but she wasn't interested, thus mounts the belief she hates my guts
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe she just really wanted to see your mom?
N🆗ri (Marisa): mmmaybe? but they see each other all the time. she kind of takes advantage of bojo by asking her to babysit the kids all the time. bojo leaves for work each day at 7am and twice last week she was out until past midnight babysitting for free at the last minute
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't think my sister understands how broke we are because when we were on the phone she was like "why is your mother working?" (she refers to bojo as only my mother <:lenny:395307171539189760>)
and they got into a big fight while i was in japan over the house. if something were to ever happen to bojo, my sister thought we'd split the house but bojo says it's all mine because 1.) she paid for the majority of my sister's house and 2.) we don't have any savings so if something happens to her and we sell the house i'd be homeless. that made her really mad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Isn't she also her mother?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yep
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa why would you split the house when she already has a house wtf
N🆗ri (Marisa): my sister considers her parents to be our family friends who helped raise her
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo was a bartender back in the day and often worked all night while sleeping in the day so she'd eat dinner with crissy (my sister), go to work, come home to get her ready for school, then sleep. they were living with family friends who were both teachers and couldn't have children of their own so they took care of her in the day.

i just don't think my sister knows me as well as she thinks she does, and her view of me is. odd. idk how to explain it but among most of my family i'm like. infantilized. my ex father will call and bojo tells him i'm out and he'll be like "it's 10pm why is she out? where is she?" and bojo will be like "i don't know she's an adult who cares"

i'll stop now but man stuff is messy <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): side note: i'm not actually out because i never leave the house. i'm usually listening to the conversation as it happens. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I noticed that when you talked before. I don't think they realise how old you really are
Aldus Larian (Jess): You lived in a foreign country for a year on your own what are you, 12?
N🆗ri (Marisa): actually i'm 13 🗡
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo does it too because we'll be somewhere (like a chinese buffet) and she'll be like "oh do you want food? what do you want?" and she'll start scooping food onto my plate while i stare into the camera like i'm on the office because apparently i'm unable to scoop food for myself
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i thought you were 13 and a half
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg no that's like old lady
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omf so sorry
N🆗ri (Marisa): i only have 2 white hairs
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh 13 I'm sorry
N🆗ri (Marisa): legally allowed to use social media <:pew:543202259085950996>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Idk why I've always had this image of your sister but have no idea where I got it cuz I've never seen her
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's not right tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg what's your image of her
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Your sister is now a foot taller than you and has darker skin tone, and also is buff and is always on the move, speedy zoom.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my buff speedy sister woah
N🆗ri (Marisa): she is always on the move. i think that's a familial thing, we can't do nothing we gotta keep moving.
we're kind of opposites? she has tattoo sleeves and loves alcohol and is very patriotic (AMERICA)
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo yea my brothers very america too
Aldus Larian (Jess): No tattoos tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): AMERICAAAAAA
N🆗ri (Marisa): this her a few years ago
N🆗ri (Marisa): she comes off as super aggressive but she's just very straight forward
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah that's the vibe I get
N🆗ri (Marisa): she cooks really well. she can make something called a heart attack on a bun which is legendary
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Does it kill you?
N🆗ri (Marisa): only if you're weak
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg more family drama related to that though, my ex father and his mother kill people with poison
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm sorry wHAT
Bill: Your sister looks like Courtney kinda.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah so my grandmother was associated with the mafia and would always try to poison my mother. literally, send her home with leftover food that would make anyone who ate it violently ill for days. everyone around my ex-father dies so my mother think he's accidentally killing everyone too
N🆗ri (Marisa): apparently my grandmother killed her husband? or he was just being used? because i'm named after him and when i was younger she was saying my name was weird and "where did they even come up with such a name?" and i was like "I was told that i'm named after your husband." and she was like "...?" and i was like "i thought his name was morris?" and she got this real confused <:woah:543194447345876998> look on her face and i was like <:huh:555585958146473984>
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh but yeah never go near my ex-father because since he left, every single one of his girlfriends and all of his roommates have died
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: He broke the rules so I hate him.
Bill: No being mean to Marisa. Rule number 1. And 2.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Truth
Aldus Larian (Jess): Holy shit
