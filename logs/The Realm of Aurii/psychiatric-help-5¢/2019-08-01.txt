Bill: Mom: “your an adult now”
Also mom: *tells anyone who can listen everything about me as a kid and their parenting and stories from when I was kid, cementing the image of child in peoples heads*
Bill: I came home to my parents giving my life story to one of the d&d group people.
Nokri (Marisa): that's gonna continue forever
Bill: I know.
Bill: And I don’t mind.
Bill: If I’m not around, or it’s to someone who I don’t care if they see me as a child.
Bill: I’m supposed to be a member of this gaming group, not “the DMs son”.
Aldus Larian (Jess): did u talk to her about it?
Bill: I’ve mentioned it before.
Bill: She has a habit of not listening when I talk to her about things. She’s where Katy gets her stubborn streak.
Bill: ~~it’s why I don’t talk to her about things I want opinions on, rather than advice about~~
Bill: Haaaa
Bill: I’m okay with always being their precious child, just. Not with people I want to be an adult to. Like the gaming group. Realtors. Apartment managers. 😑
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats tough :/
Bill: It’s not that big an issue, really. There’s only so many social circles I share with them.
Bill: But where it does come up I get annoyed quick.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that should get better when you move out? hopefully?
Bill: Oh yeah. I mean, it’s just cause it’s *my Dads* gaming group. So it’s a circle with my parents.
Bill: I don’t hang around the church, cause it’s their circle.
Bill: That kind of thing.
Bill: ~~like she wants me to talk to a girl at the church because she likes her but this girl was also *right there* as my mother gives parenting advice to the pastor about finicky kids. That’s not a good impression and she doesn’t get that at all~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats not gonna help your image to anyone
Bill: She means well. Just doesn’t get it sometimes.
