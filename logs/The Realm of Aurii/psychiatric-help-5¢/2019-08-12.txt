El🆓de Faun (Tom): THEBOOK
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The book ™
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Already dealing with bullshit. Trying to clarify a connector on a BOM and I suggest the correct part and the customer says "yes, it should be that" and then puts a different part number on the BOM. I reply saying that it still says the incorrect part and they say "yes, it should be that part" and then I check the part. It is not for the correct gauge wires *and* it's a non-stock item like, everywhere. Just flat out told the dude "THIS IS THE CORRECT PART NUMBER"
Nokri (Marisa): My skin is as dry as a nuclear desert yet my fingers are still oily enough to end fossil fuel usage once and for all
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): "can you print me 22 30page booklets?"

Bill: Think I’ll be doing the move this weekend.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): woo
Bill: Movers are fucking expensive.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I'm free if you want help
Kaio Vermino (Lee): It's my birthday this weekend so I might not be around but if I am I'll come help out if you still need it?
Bill: Birthday come first yeah. 

Help would be appreciated, the current thought is getting everything IN the apartment with movers and the help for getting the place situated. There’s some heavy stuff involved so I’m worried about having us + my dad doing it, cause stairs. But that’s if I’m able to do movers cause a thousand dollars is a *bit* much.
Nokri (Marisa): are you in a rush to move?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof I have plans this weekend
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You could probably check craigslist or something for people that just do it for side cash. When my ex was moving, she hired some dude and his gf to help move shit. They did it for extra cash and to get exercise from lifting lol. Not sure how much they charged, but I'm *sure* it was less than $1k
Bill: Found something for 535, cause they charge hourly rather than by item.
Bill: Is doable.
Bill: Done, actually. Booked it for this Friday.
Bill: Get all the big stuff moved in the truck, anything left over can be brought in a car. Which is the “rush” portion of it.
Nokri (Marisa): but why rush?
Bill: I get the keys on Friday? I’m paying for it and all my shits in boxes already. Why wait?
Nokri (Marisa): are you okay?
Bill: Yeah. Twas a good weekend.
Bill: Anyway it’s not a rush. Packing went quicker than I expected this weekend and all that’s left is the less dense part of my room.
Bill: Ye so I’m going to get everything in the apartment Friday, go shopping for essentials with my folks and crash either at their house or my place (if I wanna make up the bed), then Saturday  and Sunday I’ll be starting the unpacking progress. @everyone is welcome to come help with the deboxing, I’d understand if you wanna skip tho, not terribly interesting. You can come see the place put together later.
Bill: Speaking of packing, I got a bunch of older clamp esk books and magazines in Japanese from a friend <@!141729881779077121> / <@!301927856240459777> . Would you have any interest them? No pressure, but they aren’t from series I like and no library around here will take them so I’ll be tossing them.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~dibs if it’s something I don’t have and you’re throwing them out~~ <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Bill: Kk.
Bill: I’ll take pictures of them when I can to show you.
Bill: (Just let me know if you are coming by Saturday)
Andrew: Ill take whatever is left after Marisa.
Nokri (Marisa): We share <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Andrew: Theyd be more your thing but if you already have then im fine with extras.
Nokri (Marisa): 遠慮しないで
Andrew: And Bill I have free days I can spend soon if you wanted me to come up.
Bill: You can if you want. Though if you have limited time off, maybe save it if I do like, a housewarming.
Nokri (Marisa): Our radiator overheated three times on the 45 minute ride between Georgia’s and my cousin’s house and we went through two gallons of coolant despite not using the air conditioning so our car is out of commission for a bit
Bill: It’ll be more fun for you, unless you wanna go through my stuff. :3
Nokri (Marisa): Andru go find his secrets
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Frick I got something from Maryland saying I was speeding
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Radars are fuckin dumb
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): At least pay a person a wage to catch people speeding, not operate a robot
Aldus Larian (Jess): people need to learn to use the search bar on their computers
Aldus Larian (Jess): *orders things online for baby shower*
