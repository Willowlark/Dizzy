Bill: I finished parks and rec for Xth time and I was not ready to be so emotional about it, Ron and Leslie have such a great bond and I just.
Nokri (Marisa): today is a scary day
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Why is it scary?
Nokri (Marisa): an unwanted visitor showing up and banging on the door and leaving stuff in the door again
one of the doctors called me about a test but i never pick up my phone so it went to voicemail and now their line is busy so i can't reach them. is it normal for them to call about tests. i heard that they usually don't bother calling and just wait until the next appointment to give results unless it's something big.
Bill: Yeah it normal.
Nokri (Marisa): they didn't call about any other tests aaaa
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Yeah it's normal
El氣電e Faun (Tom): I swears
El氣電e Faun (Tom): I've had them call before to let us know theres nothing wrong
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Or like your blood sugars low or high or something
Nokri (Marisa): aaaaaaa not the sugars aaaaa
Nokri (Marisa): o the doctor himself called back wanting to make an appointment that's sooner than the one i already have <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
