Bill: ....ahahaha. Sigh. You know, it definitely feels like the more emotions I get in touch with and more open I am, the uh. More toxic a human being I am. üòÖ
Glonk: You gotta make your own moves and not rely on an app
Bill: Not really about the app but! 

Roger Blackbeard!
Bill: What ranks do those guys even have?
Bill: Operative?
Glonk: No clue. "The best of the best of the best...sir"
Bill: Yeah that you!
Bill: But... I kinda miss the days where I was just all anime all the time. It was lonely, but I didn't hurt people so much. Aaaand I just sound like V.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Brendan: well I jumped on going to firefly because I assumed I'd have a place to stay

Me: <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:then_perish:554720548274569246>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Brendan: I want to go still but now it's really inconvenient for me
 
Me: shouldve thought about that and asked before buying a 100$ ticket, huh?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:then_perish:554720548274569246>

Aldus Larian (Jess): My office mate just told me that he has to go to wedding tonight and that his fiance didn't tell him. Then he mentioned his fiance is a bridesmaid. 

So I was like "there's no was she didn't tell you"

And he was like "oh no she told me I just forgot"

Don't lie to me boi I know how these things go
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think the energy shot in my smoothie wore off because now I'm crasing
Aldus Larian (Jess): this prob applies to no one atm but like i think its just good advice so i do a post
Bill: good stuff.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I came to the park to draw in lunch but the wind is too much üò≠
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ofc
Aldus Larian (Jess): And there's no sun  üò≠
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So production only works until 11 on Fridays and I always think I'm gonna be more productive because no one's here but then I become even less productive for that very reason
Bill: ~~that‚Äôs cause Rika is ‚Äúdead‚Äù~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Plus it's Friday afternoon and I want to go home
Bill: Mood.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh no there's sun here
Bill: Plus you‚Äôve got hype for tonight I‚Äôm sure.
Nokri (Marisa): wait where'd the rika thing come from
Nokri (Marisa): o
sun?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've got hype, but like, a tired hype lol
Bill: The fact that our finger guns emote is `pew` and BNE's is `fingerguns` confuses me every time.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i watched anime all morning i feel like a useless slug
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i need to be productive but physics is done and my mom has no chores for me_
Nokri (Marisa): anime is good
what anime u watch
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): seven deadly sinsss
Nokri (Marisa): oh yeah!!
Nokri (Marisa): meliodas is so messed up
Nokri (Marisa): just something about young-looking casually mega perverted characters is unsettling
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeaaah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont really like him or elizabeth
Nokri (Marisa): i feel so bad for elizabeth she's just a big pushover to him
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Idk why I just couldn't get into seven deadly sins, I tried
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I didn't like the main girl, for the same reason I never liked Lucy from fairy tail or the girl from samurai champloo
Bill: ~~because they exist to look pretty~~
Bill: I was going to read fairy tail until I realized the main character is Natsu(?) not Lucy.
Bill: Japan has issues with strong females.
Bill: Case: Uraraka.
Nokri (Marisa): The US has issues with strong female characters
Nokri (Marisa): Uraraka is pretty neat
Nokri (Marisa): There are far worse examples
Nokri (Marisa): Or better? Examples? However it‚Äôd be said
Bill: Both are true facts.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so the x key broke on my laptop
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and my laptop is out of warranty so to repair it would be 60 dollars flat fee plus cost of repair
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _damn_
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damn..
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Although that's not too bad for a laptop repair
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if its just a key broke off? üò¨
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): depending on your laptop you might be able to self-replace if you buy a new keyboard
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I replaced a keyboard on my old laptop and it was pretty easy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): well so what happened is my individual keys have little hooks that hook onto the plate underneath
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): did it actually break or just pop off?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its just that the hooks broke off the underside so the key wont stay on now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooooh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thankfully its only the x key, probably my least used key lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I had a similar thing happen but it didn't actually break so I was able to snap it back on
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *until you go to cut and paste*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): or type a lab report with variables in it OOF
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what laptop do you have?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you might be able to get replacement keys
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.replacementlaptopkeys.com/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah thats also part of the problem, i cant tell which type laptop i have
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i know its an asus p seres
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ASUS P-Series P2440UQ-XS71 Business Laptop, Core i7, FHD Display, 12GB, 512GB SSD, Windows 10, GeForce 940MX
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but the site doesnt have "P2440UQ-XS71" leading me to believe i cant just buy a key
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): turnarond time is 7-10 days, not including shipping, if i send it to ASUS too oof
Bill: Chocowafflo is that you?
