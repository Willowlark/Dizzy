Bill: There is a correlation between happiness and how focused you are on what you are doing. Research shows the thing that hold a persons attention most is Sex at 85% of the time. 

Fun facts. ‚ÄúFun‚Äù.
Nokri (Marisa): gross
Nokri (Marisa): why not skittles
Bill: Do you focus completely on eating skittles?
Bill: Cause I dunno about you, but I sure don‚Äôt.
Tikur (Kurtis): How about sour gummi worms?
Bill: My back HURTS man how were those people able to sit on those pews and focus on mediation like that. Dear and fluffy lord.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Wait. Ok genuinely, a question from an ace person. 

Do people really think about sex that much??? How do yall enjoy life if that's all ya think about??? I'm genuinely shocked
Bill: I‚Äôm not the person to ask.
Bill: The topic is too snarled up in my various issues for me to be a good example I mean.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah i focus completely on skittles because either i want to see how each skittle varies from the next or because i dump 90 of them in my mouth at once and i have to focus on not choking to death
Bill: At the least, the 20 senior citizen women all seemed to agree with him.
Nokri (Marisa): old people are perverted
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~crosses Steve Harrington off cosplan list~*

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm like 85% anxiety
Aldus Larian (Jess): Def not.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like that's saying people think about sex 95% of the time? Or that when they are having sex it takes up 85% of thier attention?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cus I def read it as the second, which seems to more realistic
Bill: The latter yeah.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~nope that‚Äôs still 85% anxiety~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not because of a partner, that‚Äôs just me existing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What‚Äôs the other 15%? ü§î
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): thinking about mac n cheese
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I frequently realize how hungry I am
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ERIK YOU REAd my MIND
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I think to clarify it means while having sex 85% of people won't think about other things and focus completely on the sex
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or is it 85% of the sex, your brain thinks sex
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the other 15% you‚Äôre distracted
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I don't thinks that's what the stat meant but that also sounds correct
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): CLEARLY these statisticians have never seen endgame cause I focused on that movie 99.99%
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): TRUE

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I didn't even realize how bad the rain was last night.... One of the local Wawas had to be evacuated because it was flooding. Someone just shared a video of water gushing into an apartment *from the air vents*
