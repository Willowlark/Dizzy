Aldus Larian (Jess): Mr. Marisa
Aldus Larian (Jess): my wine fridge malfunctioned causing one of the bottle's to pop open and got everything in an around it wet and its got me in a funk now.  it might be shot, which i mean isnt a huge deal but it was a gift and im sentimental af
N🆗ri (Marisa): your what
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i know its extra XD when i lived at home my dad bought me a small fridge thats just for wine bottles for christmas
Aldus Larian (Jess): and its like really dumb im upset about it
N🆗ri (Marisa): nooo not dumb it was a gift!
N🆗ri (Marisa): your water bottle cooler yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): but it was legit the only time he ever went out on black friday cuz he wanted to get it for me that bad and it was on sale
N🆗ri (Marisa): Water In Nice Extra cabinet fridge
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk it just feels dumb to be upset about it...
Aldus Larian (Jess): and i really hope the temp change didnt fuck up the good wines i had in there D:
Aldus Larian (Jess): like I had the one from our honeymoon in there and i was saving it, so i hope it didnt mess up the flavor or whatever
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont even know if that happens to wine
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea its shot 😦
N🆗ri (Marisa): it shouldn't? as long as it wasn't incredibly warm i don't think?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i put it in the fridge fridge for now. i dont even know if ill replace it
Aldus Larian (Jess): its not something i really *need* and it takes up space in the living room since theres no room in the kitchen
Aldus Larian (Jess): anyway thanks for listening to my first word problem, i know you don't support the drink but I appreciate your understanding <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Bill: Awwww. I completely understand that Jess.
Bill: The thought put into a gift is SO MUCH better than the gift itself.
Bill: I’m sorry it broke.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thank 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye like its not the fact its my wine fridge its just the fact that my dad got it for me and he was really proud to give it to me, when he ussually lets my mom pick all my gifts
Aldus Larian (Jess): see ya'll dont ever give me a well thought out and planned gift cuz i will cry if it breaks
Bill: It's such a mood Jess. 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): pour one out for the ruined wine 😢
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): I just filled out too so now I have like 7 bottles of wine that have to go in the fridge 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Guess I should drink this wine that I don't have a fridge for anymore"
2 glasses later: "wheeeeee"
N🆗ri (Marisa): I was invited to an exclusive party on the rooftop of Diver City aaaaaaaaaa
That’s so fancy and cool, everyone knows Diver City, but it’s on the other side of the planeeeet
Bill: WOW you famoose.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I wish
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s the building with the giant gundam outside aaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): this place?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just love reorganizing my to-do list and getting immediately overwhelmed
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s another section of the building that has a big ball thing I think that’s where the party is
N🆗ri (Marisa): Thought that said RFA at the top not gonna lie
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa u popular
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): off the hook for driving Rebecca this weekend 🙌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but gonna need to leave Sunday at like 9:30
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!245270932602486784>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sounds Gucci 👌
Bill: ~~dude you're supposed to say that *before* work starts~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): In addition to allergies, I’m so tired too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah’s roommate sets his alarm for 7 am, and for 10 minute intervals after, and sleeps through them til 9
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I wake up (somehow) to almost all of them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how the fuck
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i dont know_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah’s an even lighter sleeper than me so he’s woken up to ALL of them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how hasnt noah killed his roommate
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So Noah’s taken to lettering his alarms ring
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So at 7 am I heard Sais alarm and Noah’s and I wanted to DIE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I was like _shut it off_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Noah was like “no I gotta get Sai up” and just covered my ears lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s gotta talk to Sai tho, cause this is wasting everyone’s time and sleep
Aldus Larian (Jess): can you guys sleep in your room? no roomate right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah tho Noah ends up workin on stuff later than me, so I knock out and like an hour later he climbs in too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I should tell him to talk to Sai or we’re sleeping in my room
Bill: “Light sleeper” “you”
Bill: You have no roommate still, why wouldn’t you go there.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Valid, I don’t know
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When we started dating I slept in his room to avoid Sarah and the habit just stuck
Bill: *obviously cause you do nothing you would want privacy for*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YUP
Bill: hehehe whoops. New girl at lunch was like "Oh I'm vegan" and I was like "Oh we have another weird eater" and there was like a half second of people being like 'dude what' and then I finished my bit about how Gord has coffee for lunch, Vincent eats Avacado like it's crack, and I only eat meat and cheese and people where like "oooooh like thatttt".
Bill: Did specifically say like 'Not judging you, we're ALL weird is what I meant' and she totally got it. But that half second was a stressful boi.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Bill: It's hard being the sarcastic one. ;;
Bill: I got a lot done today.
Bill: I can stop working now.
Bill: right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): never
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I see Ethan's in a Trump supporting mood today 🙄
Bill: I don’t cause he blocked me on Facebook and I don’t follow him on Instagram cause 🛠
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its only in close friends too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but YUP
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): -huge sigh-
Bill: I think after get ice cream for the new hire, imma just work on Aurii.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've actually made some decent progress on catching up with quotes but there's one we've been having issues with the customer and now they want it today
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's been really rough because they sent the drawings and BOMs but the BOMs didn't list the manufacturer part numbers which we need to get material pricing and then some of them weren't even complete and it just boggles my mind how incompetent their engineers are
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I really fucking hate Siemens
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ***Customer**: What is the status for this order we pre-paid for in January but have not set a due date for yet?*
***Me** (in probably a DGAS tone via email): We have yet to begin. Was there a date you needed it by?*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Me, a year ago would have been freaking out trying to think of a response that doesn't make us sound incompetent.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wow that's a mood
Bill: > going out for new hire ice cream
> go to McDonald’s cause sure
> company buys
> at lunch discussing: “oh I’ll skip the food and come for the company”
> on the way there: “not having any?” “No”
> sends someone over from the line: “you sure” “yes”
> comes over after ordering: “you sure”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Such is the life of a dieter
Bill: If I was going to put myself a week behind in my endless plateauing, it wouldn’t be for a fucking McDonald’s ice cream.
Aldus Larian (Jess): They're being polite they don't want you to feel left out
Bill: Yeah I know. The fourth time was like oof tho.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Good willpower tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And agreed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It would be for cliffs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow, a McDonalds with a functioning ice cream machine?
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds fake
Bill: Trust me I want to have a flat gut far more than I want any ice cream.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk how people do it, I’d be too much of a jealous type for polyamory
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Snows GF just posted about meeting a THIRD partner and I’m like hooooly shit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh wow
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats a lot of people in one relationship
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i cant even handle one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’d be like “but I’m your favorite right”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I don't get how people do it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is _probably_ frowned upon in polyamory
Bill: me either, but I can't get the *regular* version to work either so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think for poly they don't have favorites, everyone in the relationship just brings different qualities
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I’d _want to be_ the favorite
Bill: As it makes sense to me, being with someone in relationship should imply you're their favorite.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like there’s no question in monogamous relationships, you gotta be the fav
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Polyamorous well you got other peeps to “compete” with
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My competitive and jealous parts prevent polyamory oops
Bill: The fact that you consider it competing is probably why you would never be able to do it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _maximum attention_
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee because it isn't competing, that's why there are multiple people
Bill: The term people interested in that would use is probably more like 'everyone loving everyone'.
Aldus Larian (Jess): definitely frowned upon, there cant be a fav.  I saw an analogy that kinda put well.  like in monogamy one person is your sun, moon and stars. and with polyamory its more "this person is my sun, this other person is my moon, and this other person is my stars"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How the fuck do Valentine’s day’s work
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That becomes like another Christmas
N🆗ri (Marisa): big date
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hue game of thrones reference Jess
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): real talk, who even has that much love to give out
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like one person is enough
Aldus Larian (Jess): is that what its from?1
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea sort of
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know a few people in poly relationships, all con friends
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL YA khal drogo says it to Dany basically
Aldus Larian (Jess): like i dont "get" it in the way id wanna participate but I get why it works from some people
Bill: It's a to each their own thing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean "you are my sun, moon and stars" isnt exactly an original line
Bill: Lord help me if I crush on two people, one wrecks me enough.
Aldus Larian (Jess): people done been comparing love to the sky/space for centuries
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): multiple crushes suck, but thats a point where i understand polyamory. i just dont think i could do it personally. I dont have the energy to give attention to more than just one person....if i even have the energy for that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's a hard concept to grasp when it's not something you'd ever even think about doing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i guess it works for some people
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I still sometimes get multiple crushes, but it's more of appreciating their physical attractiveness and their personality because I think whether or not we'd actually work as a couple and more than often decide it wouldn't
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have a lot of love but it’s more like a sniper rifle than a grenade
N🆗ri (Marisa): this conversation has lost me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): take the shot
N🆗ri (Marisa): pull the trigger piglet
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean like i've had crushes on multiple people at once but it was always like "hmmkay this ones the main plan and if that dont happen, this ones next"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye a list >.> ~~this is where the list joke came from~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): like bog ol crush on person and small crush on others
Aldus Larian (Jess): anyway, ye not for me but neato for others good for them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Side note tho I’ve never had multiple crushes that probably plays a role too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m either not actively pursuing ANYONE or one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _like a lioness_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): #leo pride bby
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does anyone else doubt that those FAQs on chocowaffles story arnt actually FAQs?
N🆗ri (Marisa): what they say? :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): "are your eyes grey like ruby's?"
"Is your hair actually orange?"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): "are you Polyamourous?"
"Are you a suprano or Alto?"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): BSHSHSHHSHSJSJJSJS DID SHE REALLY
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like idk just seems like some mad specific questions. And more like answers she just wanted to give out
Aldus Larian (Jess): For the eye one she was like "no, they are blue like Weiss or Nora!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like really? <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus Larian (Jess): In other news. Ethan's fav thing about Casey is apparently her butt? So that's.... Cute...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I PUT MY FAV THING ABOUT NOAH IS HIS HUGS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ethan and Casey is just a time

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I'm just like *cool*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:hmm:543194383885926403>

N🆗ri (Marisa): i have to throw out all my rwby cosplays
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't think I can do any of my cosplays anymore rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): except neon she doesn't have a canon height i'm safe so far

N🆗ri (Marisa): basically every country except russia gets it before/at the same time as the US lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wtffff
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa you still got alotta manga to get through there
N🆗ri (Marisa): Lot less than this morning. <:pew:543202259085950996> Some of them are new ones that seemed ok and some of them are series I don’t really like but feel like keeping up on anyway so I’m procrastinating reading them <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had to go back and reread a few too because all the isekai are so similar except for one or two points that they start blending together
I didn’t know which “reincarnated as a rich lazy boy with immense magical potential who doesn’t want to do anything so cheats through life” and “summoned to another world as a cure summoner girl with a weird outfit who’s strong but embarrassed and still getting used to the outfit” had updated, I had to double check those
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why do you do this to yourself
N🆗ri (Marisa): I gotta read the manga it’s law
N🆗ri (Marisa): Anyone who wants to lose weight should use my scale it keeps going down
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did you eat?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did I?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had a couple crackers this morning
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa pls eat
Aldus Larian (Jess): You gonna has dinner?
N🆗ri (Marisa): We have potatoes and crackers <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mawisaaaaa!
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Das me!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Dizzy order Marisa a pizza
Aldus Larian (Jess): She can't eat pizza <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): NO it’s Passover that’s yeah I’d die <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): We have potatoes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH RIGHT I SORRY
N🆗ri (Marisa): Boil em mash em stick em in a stew
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are u gonna eat da potato?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): serious question, what cant you eat on passover?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What can't you eat because of passover
N🆗ri (Marisa): Im gonna eat the whole potato raw
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bread, and usual jewish stuff like pork and beef/milk or chicken/egg combos
N🆗ri (Marisa): In ancient times when Jews got chased out of Egypt they didn’t have time to let the bread rise so that’s why there’s matzah for Passover
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ooooooooooooooooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo my coworker gave me a macaron yesterday? It was good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats interesting 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): M a c a r o o n s !
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA that whoops
N🆗ri (Marisa): Macarons are better than macaroons I think ahh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I knew about the matzah thing grin ~~Rugrats~~ religion class in elementary school
Aldus Larian (Jess): Some flatbreads are ok?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or nah?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Idk, I don’t think so, I think only matzah since it’s like the most basic of basic bread components. Using matzah to bread stuff is pretty good tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The article I'm reading says you can eat chicken,  beef, and eggs?
Aldus Larian (Jess): :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just not together usually
You can’t eat a child in the blood of it’s parents or something, so beef and cheese/milk or chicken and egg is a no go
