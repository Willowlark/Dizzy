Bill: 1 hour into day and I question myself for volunteering for another day tomorrow.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): one of my friends from like 6 years ago, i aporadically talked to
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she asked "are you still dating ozpin"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i was like like "nah that guys a ho"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and she was like "oh no what did ozpin do"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "ozpin fucks ALL"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OOF
Bill: Talking with Jing at lunch... she’s really fucking done with my old project and Gord isn’t doing too much to get transitioned.
Bill: He might lose her at this rate.
Bill: Which would be a shame, I find her the best to work with from the data science  team.
Bill: The team doesn’t need her anymore either, pulling her out won’t even be a negative.
Bill: Gord mentioned once that he thought I was particularly suited to contracting as a personality... I think he’s right. Everyone else seems frustrated by ibm’s lack of focus and sporadic ideas, being more business than technically focused... meanwhile all I care about is doing what they need to be happy. If I do that in the same 3 ways I have been, it’s okay with me, I don’t need new techniques every day to be engaged.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whomp
Bill: That may be IBM specific though, I’ve only worked with them as a client.
Bill: But at the very least the rest of the team is deeply frustrated they can’t do bigger and better data models on their projects cause the ibmers only focus is satisfying the stakeholders and making their yearly goals.
Bill: I'm going to forget what actual working is like from all this discussion.
Bill: I was about to complain about the lack of break but huzzah break.
Bill: I don’t wanna go back upppp
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pretend you died
Bill: I’m already dead tho!
Bill: *they just keep talking*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sorry dude, that sounds like actual hell
Bill: Just gotta remember it’s going to make the next 3-6 months easier.
Bill: And twoish hours left.
Bill: ~~today~~
Bill: I’m just wired cause of the chatting before.
Bill: I should go out in white plains tonight... I'm a few blocks from the downtown.
Bill: ~~so much for editing photos on the trip~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea go out!
Bill: If I have the energy to 😅
Bill: Tomorrow is only a half day workshop!
Bill: I am MOST DEFINITELY leaving early!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WOOOOOO
Bill: Some of the IBMer execs came in for a summary of the workshop, and Anand STILL has that obnoxious high pitched phone ring on max volume going off.
Bill: Those are your BOSSES guy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "Can you help this man find lamb dog food for his dog?"
"NOT LAMB, DOG! I don't know why she keeps saying lamb food!!! I NEED DOG FOOD FOR MY DOG."
"ok sir, so what flavor are you looking for?"
"Lamb"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/the-office-stanley-hudson-leslie-david-baker-eye-roll-rolling-eyes-gif-4492265
Aldus Larian (Jess): holy shit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....am i in hell
Bill: No I am.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/hopeless-disappointed-ryan-reynolds-facepalm-embarrassed-gif-5436796
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we must be on different levels then, bill
Bill: oh that gif is from the proposal. Good movie.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): asgdasdj LMAO
Bill: ?
Aldus Larian (Jess): sounds like your both in hell
Bill: I miss music while working.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i almost just had a heart attack cuz my coworker was like "you dont have enough vacation days" and i was like WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): but she forgot about my floating holiday <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: The interns joined the workshop today... The girl has been trying to follow and even contributed like twice, the guy definitely gave up. XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): i gotta switch my tatics yall
Aldus Larian (Jess): i handed my time off request directly to my boss and he approved it right away but that probably because he's in this weird mood where he feels bad about always cancelling meets wow what a win-win
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo my niece might need heart surgery 😭
Bill: Ooo seemed like something exciting but that’s not exciting it worrying 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea :( her one valve never closed up properly she had double hernia surgery last Friday too, her over was out of place also
Aldus Larian (Jess): Poor kid
Aldus Larian (Jess): So Marisa PM'd me earlier but she's decided to take a break from the server for a little while. she told me that if anyone has questions about her party that i can message her on facebook 😦
Bill: She actually left...
Bill: 😭
Bill: I hope she’s doing it for herself and not cause she thinks she’s annoying us...
Bill: Hell I’m more trouble than she is.
Aldus Larian (Jess): she said "leave for *awhile*" so im guessing that means she plans on coming back.
Bill: I’m sure she does.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hope it's soon
Aldus Larian (Jess): me too 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): i am big sad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): me too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I miss her already
Aldus Larian (Jess): ME TOO 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 😦
Bill: We have to believe she’s taking steps for herself and her wellbeing. She’s been depressed a... long time, she’s must know what she needs to take care of herself. 

That’s how I’m going to think of it. I don’t know if it’ll be any comfort to you but...
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I think she still thinks shes doing for us
El🆓de Faun (Tom): but i hope its what she needs
Bill: If she is... well, that’s what DMs are for.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): dm her every day
El🆓de Faun (Tom): with a screenshot of all the channels
Bill: I have every intention to.
Bill: I’ll give her some time if she’s ACTUALLY look for space for herself... but if she’s like “I’m so glad I’m not annoying you” at her party she’s getting DMs every day to make it explicitly clear I want to talk to her.
Glonk: 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm crying over this yall. But i dont wanna tell her cuz i dont want her to feel worse
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~im channeling it into working on her present~~  but im edging on tears too
Bill: I’m in... sort of the “fix it” mood, but I know there’s nothing I can do I’m just like... ready. Does that make sense?
Bill: Serious and pensive.
Aldus Larian (Jess): me too 😦 i thought i had convinced her not leave but i didnt and now i feel like i failed
Bill: You didn’t fail. You couldn’t convince her anymore than I could.
Bill: No one could.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i know but it make the sad
Bill: Mm.
Bill: It’s.
Bill: Very sad.
Bill: I want to message her... but I have to respect her choices.
Bill: I was going to go out.
Bill: 
Bill: She said the same thing she’s been saying, that “she’s bringing us down” and “she bothers us” when I sent her the invite. As far as I’m concerned, DM the crap out of her.
