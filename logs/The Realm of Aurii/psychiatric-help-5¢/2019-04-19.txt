Elfriede Faun (Tom): DEATH BY PORK CHOP
Bill: Cross fingers that when I wake up intermittent fasting is actually the plateau breaker and it wasn’t coincidental I dropped when I did it yesterday. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It does help so I've heard
Bill: Mhmm. It’s a good thing to try, Gord’s been doing it for ages. I’m just hoping it’s more effective than I expect it is.
Bill: I was supposed to do more of it, but I needed a base line of eating information to show trader so I couldn’t get in the habit (cause I was recording what my normal habits were)
Bill: What the fuck is with me I got up early and my mind has been all over the place. I try and understand about I’m feeling and it just disappears into some new random thing.
Bill: Weird trip and I hate it.
Bill: ooooh it worked. Assuming the Starbucks isn't also party of the formula I think I can break da plateau with dis.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woooo!
Bill: Me: it's rude for Matt to ask Hunter for finished photos
Also Me: Hunter will likely never give him the photos if he doesn't ask about them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hunter
Bill: and Matt.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean both yea but
Bill: Such facepalm.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "oh yea i just forgot "
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Well hes a guy so lower priority
Bill: It true.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ... does ethan send anyone else these long ass chain videos of him singing or am I just the only one unlucky enough to endure this?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh good you poor thing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He just sent me 12 in a row
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Why this
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I never respond
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wh

N🆗ri (Marisa): “You know what Leanna would really like? Definitely this.” -Ethan
Aldus Larian (Jess): YUP

Aldus Larian (Jess): Tell him your phone can't play videos anymore
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's super convincing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Left on unopened
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yes.... give it up..... pls give up......
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof yeah he didn't even send *me* that surprisingly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also I'm just really curious how long Hunter will go before he gets mine and Georgia's photos back
Bill: Eating dinner at home is getting annoying... just cause I finish my meal in 10 minutes, mom in 15, and Dads still fucking making his salad at that point and he’s the slowest eater of all of us. So I end up just sitting here getting bored and irritable cause it’s just him eating and mom ends up on her phone and... ugh.
Bill: Part of that is he does his insulin before dinner and that takes time but. It’s frustrating.
