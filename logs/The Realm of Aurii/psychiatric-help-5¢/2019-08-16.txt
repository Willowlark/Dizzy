Bill: Fuck. I just cancelled the moving company. We were looking into the company more and theyâ€™re info doesnâ€™t match what they told me. 

The ACTUAL company theyâ€™re registered under is a huge scam.
Bill: Fuckity fuck.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Nokri (Marisa): did you give them any money or bank info?
Bill: No.
Aldus Larian (Jess): das gud then
Bill: So long as they get the message I left and donâ€™t show up tomorrow morning.
Bill: Not that they can bill me.
Bill: Trying to find someone else cause dad and I canâ€™t move all this.
Nokri (Marisa): you can rent a uhaul for like $30 plus another $1.50 per mile you drive
Nokri (Marisa): but since you're just one person moving into an apartment i'd assume it just takes one trip
Bill: Like I said, me and my dad cannot loft everything to the second floor apartment, from second floor in my house alone. Itâ€™s too much for just me and Dads not as spry as he thinks he is.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): nice catch
Bill: Bless Mom asking questions again. The place clearly uses a different name to hide their bad rep.
Bill: Itâ€™s *really* bad.
Bill: Might have luck with someone Mr Brain recommended last minute. Maybe. If not.
Bill: <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> internally

Bill: Anyway. I have a headache and half now.

Bill: Both.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Meds time!
Bill: Sleep time.
Bill: Guys too busy tomorrow to fit me in. So itâ€™s me and dad and mom. Mom canâ€™t do steps and books. Dad thinks if we rent a truck we can do everything but the couch, 200lb tv stand, and bed.
Bill: Wooo what a mess.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Wooo yeah everything but big furniture probably, damn
Aldus Larian (Jess): 200lb tv stand?! <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn son
Bill: Ugh.
Bill: Donâ€™t want Dad killing himself either.
Bill: Playing it by ear on how much weâ€™ll do ourselves tomorrow.
