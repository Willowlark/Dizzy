N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo broke her toe today and won't go to the hospital despite a really messed up foot
good ol' american healthcare system
Bill: Oh no. That not good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't think there's much they can do for broken toes though?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's what she said
"why would i pay several hundred dollars to go to a hospital when i can do the exact same things myself"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Which toe is it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think her little toe, or the one next to it. she didn't say which but those two were the most swollen
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe the one next to the little one
N🆗ri (Marisa): it looked kind of messed up
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did she tape her toes together?  I
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think that's what they do. 
Just google dat shit
N🆗ri (Marisa): no, she said she wrapped them but when she got home it was just her sock, and the sock was putting too much pressure and felt too tight so she took that off?
she dropped it at her first job and then went to her second job and then came home where i threw ice at her
Bill: Yeah I’m told you can’t do anything with busted toes. Just tape em and they heal.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! Poor bo jo! Def ice and tape and maybe an anti inflammatory?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee that's a good idea, i'll see if we have any that aren't 5+ years expired
N🆗ri (Marisa): she took a bunch of pills too
Bill: A (particularly incompetent) GMV user just dropped me a message "This doesn't work and I was supposed to send it today, can you tell me whats wrong". Except he didn't include the other file I need to test.
Bill: And he's been ignoring the message(S) I've sent to him asking *for* that file for two hours.
Bill: So.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds fake but ok
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have reached official creep tier
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was told I could find a certain professor for research between 1 and 2
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I’m just camped in the sitting room near her office with my business casual and my resume
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _let it be known that Georgia has tried so hard for research_
Elfriede Faun (Tom): IT IS KNOWN
N🆗ri (Marisa): you sound like the the protagonist's nervous assistance friend who's always working in a romcom movie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh my gosh I am
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait no 🆖  means no good 🙀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): gg good good
N🆗ri (Marisa): we gotta counteract it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I tried to find another letter to use for N lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): good great
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okay so every ten minutes I’m gonna check if she’s in her office cause I can’t directly see her from here
N🆗ri (Marisa): 📍 🇻 = n
N🆗ri (Marisa): good

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ♑
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There’s the last N
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🤡 📯
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 🇰 🇳 🇴 🇼 ♑
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wonder if I should knock on the office door, usually professors leave the door open if they’re in there
N🆗ri (Marisa): is there a secretary or a student worker? when i worked at rowan we knew where all the teachers were and usually kept track of the students coming and going in search of professors, but my desk was in a weird spot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah this is the general physics building so it’s just straight up offices
N🆗ri (Marisa): ugh japanese universities are like that it's so weird
N🆗ri (Marisa): rows upon rows of doors but they were always shut
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): One of the professors walked by and idk his name I just know he spilled seltzer all over his shoes at the physics bbq and still hung out for his burger
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 1 PM: not currently in office
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If it gets to 1:20 I’ll knock
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): For now I’m just gonna spot check 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And if I don’t catch her by her meeting at 2, then I’m gonna try when it’s over at 3:30, and if that doesn’t work, it’s EMAIL TIME
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My tutors boyfriend works for her now and says she’s trying to fill two positions with undergrads so I’m especially determined for this one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also because it’s the exact research I want, NUCLEAR ☢️
Bill: Nothing bad can happen from knocking. If she's there, you found her, if she's not, no one will no.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okay 1:10 I will knock
N🆗ri (Marisa): no one will know because she'll erase all witnesses
Bill: Ask the secretary in the office.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it is 1:10
Bill: Secretaries usually know where professors are at.
Bill: also totally fake Erik ma boi.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There’s no secretaries here it’s a lawless land
N🆗ri (Marisa): she said there weren't secretaries how horrifying 🙀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I knocked, no answer oof
Bill: Oh I skimmed things. Marisa has support covered I yeet away now
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no don't leave me here i don't know what i'm doing uh

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh my tutors boyfriend has an office right next door to her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He was v nice we talked while the physics building was on fire yesterday and everyone was evacuated
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He was the one that said I should definitely try to find her before her 2 pm meeting
N🆗ri (Marisa): casual fires nbd
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was a dumpster fire so there wasn’t technically a reason to clear the building for so long
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's just the US education system as a whole
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ve just been rereading the poster outside her office now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s like a different language
N🆗ri (Marisa): pbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpb
N🆗ri (Marisa): that feel when you read something too many times it loses its meaning
memorize it so if she asks something you can't answer you can just recite that and impress her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): PbPb is gold gold
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): pp is proton proton
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They’re the two things you can smash together
N🆗ri (Marisa): moon moon is moon moon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh no I have to use the bathroom
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okie I’ll wait til 1:20

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 🅱️lease
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HA I GOT HER
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she said she was interested in taking undergrads and would send me a few papers of hers to see what I think. And from there we would “keep in touch” about work for next year
N🆗ri (Marisa): GOTEM
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So let’s hope this goes somewhere 🙏
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Now I sprint to a review session I’m late for because I waited around
Bill: Follow up with her on the papers and you've done everything you can. Pat yourself on the back and move on.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yes indeed
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): As long as I’m trying and putting my best foot forward, that’s all anyone could ask of me
Bill: Anyone includes yourself.
Bill: Waiting game is hell of course, which is why it's best to play all your cards on the table, then forget about it till you need to check back.
Bill: Ignore me though, I'm unprovoked lecturing again.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m still havin a nervous sweat oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s like yo calm down body there’s no chance of dying anymore
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/26052489/android/sticker.png;compress=true
Bill: Welp I was right, the dumbass who forgot to give me files this morning?
Bill: HUGE pain.
Bill: The files are all wrong, I can't even run them to *reproduce* the error, let alone debug THAT.
