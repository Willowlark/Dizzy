Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Scott doing the thing cosplayers say **not** yo do? More likely than you think* üëÄ
Bill: Not sure where you were going with that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): a lot of cosplayers preach not to say any one person is *the best* at being a character
Aldus Larian (Jess): ‚òù
Bill: aaah, that's what you meant
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and yet, here's Scott doing exactly that
Bill: I didn't make the connection.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and he's usually one to do preachy things like that, so I just thought it was a little hypocritical lol
Bill: Oh yeah I don't follow him.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah that critical role group at Katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Couple people to avoid all grouped together?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _convenient_
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just thought about how cold katsu is and got sad lmao

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don‚Äôt really care either way about Meg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal was a heckin weirdo last year, waltzing up to me at a private shoot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _Snow_ no thanks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _Scott_ eh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Snow thanks* <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Honestly seeing Hal walk up to me from an outside perspective was probably hilarious
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like the photographer was taking pictures and he just trotted on over with his ukulele
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ‚Äúheeeeey what‚Äôs up‚Äù
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): pfffffft
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bonus awkward because he was wearing Jaune
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm like tryna not to move like ‚Äúhey‚Äù
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): would have been great if you were in Weiss
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): canon interaction
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like trying to talk to someone while their shooting is like the dentist tryna talk to you while they have stuff in your mouth
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it should just be proper etiquette to just like, not bother a shoot in progress?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _you would think_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm not the type to go out of my way to talk to exes either
Aldus Larian (Jess): üçµ
Aldus Larian (Jess): was this at ota? what did i miss?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah Katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow this share for share, seeing Snows face everyone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Oof
