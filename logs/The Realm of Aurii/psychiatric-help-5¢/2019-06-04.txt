Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Don't want the group to get too big. What a fucking mood, Scott

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you're very not wrong
Bill: Move group avengers to a New York meetup (fittingly) and do core at Katsu.
N👌kri (Marisa): japan has a lot of big cosplay groups at events, but also the events there are *just* for cosplay. there are usually no panels or concerts or dances or anything, and people have to change at the event so they only pack one costume or two very light costumes. (maybe a concert at choukaigi but no other events i can think of.)

there was one bnha group at fuyuket though that was just kind of milling around. they were too disorganized to assemble in under 10 minutes when someone asked for a picture of them all
Bill: *SCREAMING*
