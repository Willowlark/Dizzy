N🆗ri (Marisa): Called into the meeting and there’s so many people talking over each other that you can’t tell what’s happening. Also they didn’t mail out the PowerPoint again so we can’t follow along. <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): The people calling in are on mute, it’s the ~10 people who actually physically showed up that are all talking over each other
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Ethan: (to Georgia) "Your husbando [Peter Parker] is a 16 year old?" ~scoffs~
> Also Ethan: "Toga is best girl"

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 27?
N🆗ri (Marisa): WOW
N🆗ri (Marisa): 4 year age difference tops 10/11
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 28?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wow he’s older than I thought
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no he's 27, almost 28 in July
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and he always says things when he hangs out with us like "Ugh I'm so old..." and I'm like, you're *not* that much older than me... Maybe you're old compared to Georgia and Casey....
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but like, you're not that old. I hang out with people older than him
N🆗ri (Marisa): *how old is casey*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 21-22ish?
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): that puts a lot more uncomfort into their relationship
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's not too bad but. <:hmm:543194383885926403>

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tom Holland is 22, try to gripe with that ETHAN
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I thought he was 27. Don't matter either way
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So changing the subject, I think I might start seriously looking at apartments soon
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I went to a friend's apartment yesterday and it was really nice. I checked online and saw they had some vacancies starting the end of June and rent is $1100/month which I think could be doable for me (just gotta actually check my other monthly payments)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's only like 10 minutes away from my house, but I really would like to move out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And the job search has been slow lately so I'll probably continue to suffer there for a while
N🆗ri (Marisa): Does the rent include utilities?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t know how common that is but that’d be sweet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not sure but I sent the complex an email asking
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could probably just ask my friend lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooo an e-mail means serious!! That’s a good way to show interest as a prospective renter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but for a 1 bed/1 bath it was really nice. Had a washer/dryer which is really nice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.apartments.com/victoria-crossing-apartments-wyomissing-pa/83615b0/
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo comes with internet and cable and some apartments are already furnished
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Cosplay made by _____" bitch that's the same costume I bought off Amazon
N🆗ri (Marisa): it sure is omg, first result on amazon
did yours come with the collar and bracelet?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yup! It's the exact outfit lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): i looked up the person she tagged, it's a private account but has a link to a nsfw patreon where all the costumes are purchased
maybe she got the outfit secondhand and assumed it was made <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rooster Teeth's Xbox app is garbage
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They moved all of their Minecraft let's plays its  own series on the website but it doesn't show up on the xbox app and the search bar is useless
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also constantly logs me out for no reason
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh wait I found the minecraft
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): App is still garbage though
