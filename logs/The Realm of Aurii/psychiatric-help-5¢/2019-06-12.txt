I feel so bad for her
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Luckily though, on the bright side, shes too young to remember any of this traumatizing stuff.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And as she gets older her body will get stronger too. Hopefully that means less complications

Nokri (Marisa): how far away do they live?
Aldus Larian (Jess): they live close maybe like half an hour, the nicu shes been at is about half an house also. the surgry hospital is in Manhattan
Nokri (Marisa): you could make them food, or send them food
or offer to take care of house things like laundry, cleaning, walking pets if they have any
they might reject your help but if you see them struggling it's best to just do them anyway
Nokri (Marisa): when they get back from the hospital it might help to come back to a clean house, with warm food ready
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats tru
i had considered that but their dog is big boi and pulls me down really easily so i cant really walk him. im also just big awkward with stuff like this but thats a whole other issue 
they come home every night, she lives there but they arn't staying there my brothers been working the whole time, shes on maternity leave
