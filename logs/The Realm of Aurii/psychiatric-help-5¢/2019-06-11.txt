Nokri (Fopdoodle): o no yeah that wasn't me that was some guy named anh
i have learned valuable info
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nonsense! Don't believe only the random dick 🙏 
That's a super scumbag move by them and on top of that so many people think youre super pretty. Thats our non biased opinion too, not just because we love you
Aldus Larian (Jess): WAIT
Aldus Larian (Jess): That guy's a dick
Aldus Larian (Jess): Random guy opinion no matter
Nokri (Fopdoodle): valuable input from unbiased third party
Aldus Larian (Jess): We kill him
Nokri (Fopdoodle): no!!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🗡
Nokri (Fopdoodle): that's murder!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ⚔
El🆓de Faun (Tom): They are biased tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): They were gonna say that to the first person they saw I'm sure
Nokri (Fopdoodle): o was it because i was alone. because he walked past a bunch of people but they were all in clusters
Aldus Larian (Jess): Probably
Nokri (Fopdoodle): i got an autograph tho so it's cool
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah that was probably why
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Autograph from him?!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Let's make a voodoo doll
Nokri (Fopdoodle): noo from aimi!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh good!
Nokri (Fopdoodle): i got his facebook info though i was gonna just let it sit forever 👀
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:mew_face:498866691963355137> <:mew_face:498866691963355137> <:mew_face:498866691963355137> <:mew_face:498866691963355137> <:mew_face:498866691963355137> <:mew_face:498866691963355137> <:mew_face:498866691963355137> <:mew_face:498866691963355137>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🔪
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Facebook voodoo doll
Aldus Larian (Jess): He added you on Facebook?!
Nokri (Fopdoodle): yeah on the spot, he tried to get me to send the request but my internet sucked inside the con so he had me send the request from his phone
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~He sounds like a tool~~
Nokri (Fopdoodle): yeah he said he was the one who dumped his girlfriend, i felt bad for her
Bill: Why did you talk to him in the first place.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "my girl was a 10 but I dumped her"
Nokri (Fopdoodle): he came up and talked to me
Nokri (Fopdoodle): yeah!!!
Nokri (Fopdoodle): that's essentially how the conversation went while looking at pictures of her under a pretty tree
Bill: *say Applebee’s*
Nokri (Fopdoodle): that would do literally nothing though
Bill: That’s why you need safety friends.
Bill: To cosplay with too!
Nokri (Fopdoodle): everyone already left though you all had better things to do and it would have been unfair to make anyone stand around with me for over an hour. additionally, cosplaying with people only disappoints them and i let them down big time.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nop
Aldus Larian (Jess): When was this?
Bill: Nope. Every compliment I gave your cosplays was truth.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cosplaying with you made my whole weekend
Bill: Shooting you was the only good thing at the con Sunday!
Nokri (Fopdoodle): noo my cosplay are bad and i hold everyone back from full potential
meeting anh was sunday around 4:10ish
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nah better than mine for sure
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah mawisa i wish i had more time to hang with you!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but i liked getting to see you ❤
Nokri (Fopdoodle): TOM URS IS SO GOOD THO
sorry for hogging most of the bed again oops and for piling my junk all over it
El🆓de Faun (Tom): NAH BUT THANK ILL TAKE THW COMPLIMENT
Nokri (Fopdoodle): i kept trying to clean up throughout the weekend and put my stuff away but there were always a lot of people around until saturday night
Nokri (Fopdoodle): and i didn't want to get in their way too aaaa i kept getting in rayna's way she was nice
Aldus Larian (Jess): Rayna is sweet bean I'm sure you weren't in da way
Nokri (Fopdoodle): i ruined aliens 3 oops
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao Dave was just saying.today how you.made alien and cosplay wrestling halarious
Nokri (Fopdoodle): nooo
alien cubed was ruined forever and cosplay wrestling was improved due to those two girls near me who were losing their minds
Nokri (Fopdoodle): such good commentary
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He said alien was 10x better cuz of you literally like 7hours ago
Nokri (Fopdoodle): it's basically hentai
Aldus Larian (Jess): Your poor mother
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OH NO IT IS?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wait alien?
Nokri (Fopdoodle): ya
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Jess confused me xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoopa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ignore me fam
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I actually haven't seen any aliens so I cannot refute that
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Well I mean face huggers exist
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So yeah I won't refute that
El🆓de Faun (Tom): https://i.imgur.com/tI4Zm2i.jpg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Customer emailed today with changes to two assemblies they ordered. Luckily, we're so behind that we hadn't started it yet <:pew:543202259085950996> but since the assembly changed, I needed to update the price. So I sent them a revised quote saying please send a revised PO at your earliest convenience. I get a call from them about an hour and a half later asking if we could just add the additional charge to the shipping cost when we invoice them because it takes 5 or more days to update a purchase order.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I'm just like, uuuuhhh....... I can ask and I'll let you know
Bill: What is fopdoodle Marisa.
Nokri (Fopdoodle): my legal name
Bill: -_-
Bill: This isn’t some kind of dig at yourself is it.
Bill: Cause that’s not allowed.
Bill: Rule number 1: be nice to Marisa.
Bill: ~~do I just take that as confirmation~~
Nokri (Fopdoodle): do i need to provide my birth certificate
Bill: Yes.
Bill: It would be illegal to lie about your legal name. 🚓
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mawisa no
Bill: Fixed.
Nokri (Marisa): name broken
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Creative insult tho
Nokri (Marisa): yeah biru how did you come up with this name?
Bill: Marisa? Well I thought of one of the most precious people in the world, someone who touches the hearts of everyone around her despite her own struggles and the word just came to mind.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): x2
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Skilled in the art of insult
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So talented waow
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Honestly perfect in every way
Nokri (Marisa): i think Gudgeon fits a lot better
Bill: ~~I’ll give you props for creativity though and not just calling yourself a piece of shit like the rest of us~~
Nokri (Marisa): That word is illegal <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Glonk: 👆
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I just noticed that the casing on one of our microwaves looks kind of banged up and isn't completely sealed (ie, there are gaps you can clearly see light coming out of) so that's probably not entirely safe
Bill: When has that stopped me?
Bill: My work laptop can’t hold a change anymore!
Bill: 😑
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37248049?SThisFB
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He wasn't dead already?!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah that article is 3 years ago
Nokri (Marisa): That happened in 2016 yeah
Bill: lol what.
Bill: Peter troll me.
Bill: Remember fancy intern?
Bill: I’m living for the fact his my primary role is to write documentation.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there have been so many articles of old celebrity deaths circulating around as if they're new
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): someone posted one for Kurt Cobain yesterday
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was like BRUH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): lmaoo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Still haven't gotten an email back from apartment guy. Checked the availability and still no 1 bed, but they added two new 2 beds
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~sigh~*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh god I slept so late
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): customers keep calling me about things.... I've had to take 3 calls today
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which is also distracting me from getting my actual work done
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because they're calling me about things that are lower on my priority list which is getting me side-tracked
Nokri (Marisa): what's gonna happen with the thinking channel
i'm honored and appreciate it but also it makes me feel incredibly reprehensible, guilt-ridden, and horrified
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHEEZES I GOT AN INTERVIEW FOR A TEACHING ASSISTANT POSITION THIS SUMMER
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THEY WANT 5 REFERENCES holy shit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oof welp im gonna call to schedule an interview lets see what happens
Nokri (Marisa): ye teaching positions are super demanding
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AH THEY WANT TO INTERVIEW ME ON THURSDAY WHAT
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wpah
Nokri (Marisa): it's a summer teaching position right? it's summer!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye thats still cray!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i feel like i need to wear a power suit but i know its just a phone interview
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oof that guy had a strong accent
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i have to submit a lesson plan ahead of time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i have 24 hours to make and submit a lesson plan what
Nokri (Marisa): it's ez you can do it!
how long are the lessons? i've had to come up with 40 minute lesson plans on the spot i can help if u need
Nokri (Marisa): all lessons basically follow the same formula and then you just mix and match activities based on what you're teaching
Nokri (Marisa): also depends on who you're teaching to
Nokri (Marisa): all ages are basically the same though except for high schoolers because they're edgelords
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What exactly is a lesson plan?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is it a PowerPoint?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or just an outline of a topic that you’ll teach?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And they’re high schoolers lol
Nokri (Marisa): a powerpoint would be material for your lesson plan
it's basically a timeline of how the lesson will go, let me see i have any of mine brb
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH here's one i came up with for somebody else to teach english learners so it's not quite physics, but it gives you an idea of what a lesson plan looks like
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): You break the lesson down into chunks and say "here's the warm-up, here's what i'm going to teach, here's how the class is going to apply that knowledge in an activity, here's how we'll review and gauge how much the students have learned at the end of the lesson"
Nokri (Marisa): any powerpoints, handouts, and notes that the students get or that the teacher shows to the class would go at the end of a lesson plan as necessary materials
Nokri (Marisa): 24 hours is a lot of time to come up with a lesson plan for someone who's regularly teaching, so if you feel uncertain i'd recommend doing some research into lesson plans and get an idea of some common activities you can cycle through so you feel more confident coming up with stuff on the spot, because a lot of teaching interviews also ask you to do a mock lesson
Nokri (Marisa): think back to the lessons you take and the lessons you had in high school!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooo yes thank!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Today at work be like
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t think my pot is big enough for this week’s food <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): I have more potatoes that need to go in
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): noah said a weird thing today <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he said i shy away from challenge and he doesnt know how to feel about that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he was like "obviously i love you and i have no plans to break up with you, but i didnt realize that about you til now and it makes me feel weird"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and now _I_ feel weird
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i feel weird but mostly sad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Why does that have anything to do with breaking up? That's the part that I don't get
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think he saw my face when he said it and i looked very sad/scared
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so he assumed that i assumed the worst
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also I don't think you shy away from challenge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah i didnt really think so either
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont think i could be a physics major and shy away from challenge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You've been putting yourself out there to try to gain some sort of experience to further your career... you applied for an internship at NASA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, *that* is a challenge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *you majoring in physics is a challenge in and of itself*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah i told him that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was like "i dont get what youre saying, i barely skirted by on Cs last semester, and challenged myself with the second course in the sequences and got B+s"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Did he give you examples of challenges he thought you shied away from?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like he said i havent practiced guitar in a long time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i pointed out that i started january not knowing ANYTHING
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and now im pretty ok
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): even if i hadnt picked it up in the last two weeks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): honestly i think its cause hes miserable at his internship that hes saying weird things
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like he has NO friends there and he HATES the work
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so hes in a sad pit and wants to just see the bad in everything
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was hoping it wasnt me at least .-.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah that could be putting him in a mood. Still doesn't excuse him being a poopyhead
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah it was a weird comment to make!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he said he went to bed feeling weird last night when he came to that realization
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i was like w h a t
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then he told me today and he was like "i understand if me saying that makes you mad, you dont have to visit me, i just wanted to be honest with you"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): which saying 'you dont have to visit" when i know thats one of his lifelines right now... sounds like self sabotage
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): which is depressed behavior
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean he still ended the convo with "ill talk to you later, i love you"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://media1.tenor.com/images/d8c45e8b73e46686c0794ea88cc56076/tenor.gif?itemid=8562082
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): boys are weird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You're not wrong
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im only 20 and kinda sick of dating too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i just want one to work out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its really tiring letting people into your life and then booting them out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and ive only done that three times so far LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): now i feel weird still, im gonna go for a run
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good idea
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if anyone has more commentary plz lemme know cause i feel weird still
Nokri (Marisa): How long has he been there again?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): three week
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no frands, bad colleagues, bad work
Nokri (Marisa): before this point was he somewhat optimistic? or was it just a straight nosedive
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): seems kinda like a nosedive
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hes never been an optimist, more a realist
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): now he seems straight pessimist
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he says he doesnt have any motivation or find physics exciting anymore
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): note: _anymore_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *welcome to the real world*
Nokri (Marisa): im thinking this is some kind of culture shock hitting him. saw a lot of people undergo this in japan.

changes in location are stressful, no matter what. if you move to a new house, or start a new school, or a new job. any major change in your location is going to add stress to your body, even if it's a good change!!! you can be the happiest person in the world going to live in your dream house and it'll still take a while before that weird stress goes away. some feel it more than others.

there's also a time when someone moves where their "honeymoon period" starts to end and they face reality, and that's when the bad feelings hit their hardest. i was gonna say that maybe noah's honeymoon period with his new situation is over, but it sounds like instead he's done *adjusting* to it. the adjustment period is over, reality is settling in, he doesn't like it and the disillusionment stage begins. this is also a period that everyone who moves to a new place experiences, but noah's might be especially harsh since he hates his surroundings
Nokri (Marisa): having no motivation and finding priorly loved hobbies boring is a definite sign of depression <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): thanks for coming to my ted talk i'll go back to soup now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thank mawisa!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah i think its the depression hitting him too hard
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): when i would get p depressed id just want to push everyone away
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok i run now to stop thinking the bad thought
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Now that’s what I call Anxiety™️
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo noooo yeah sounds like he's just depressed and potentially irritable?
