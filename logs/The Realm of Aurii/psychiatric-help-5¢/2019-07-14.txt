Nokri (Marisa): The power went out again 😭
Nokri (Marisa): It might’ve been the microwave, but I made sure to turn the TV off before using it so I don’t know the true cause, because usually the microwave is fine to use if the TV is off and everything else is unplugged
Nokri (Marisa): And there’s a wasp nest out back where the circuit breaker is aaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh nooo! 😭
Nokri (Marisa): omg but I hear a noise upstairs Sylvia might be playing with her favorite toy for the first time since I washed it. A silver lining
Nokri (Marisa): SHE IS! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): Power’s back on, and it looks like our neighbors are siphoning our electricity again which is why the bill is so high
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG what?! I'mma fight someone
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok no I'm not cuz I'm a whiny but that's bs
Nokri (Marisa): I’m very happy about the toy situation yay
Yeah the neighbors do that sometimes <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Nokri (Marisa): Fight! Fight! Fight!
Nokri (Marisa): “Pls hire me to be Otakon photographer so I can pay for my neighbor’s electricity” lol
