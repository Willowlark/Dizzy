Nokri (Marisa): i always joke that our house is like a dangerous sweatshop, but we just got a really good offer that really would make it a sweatshop <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
this woman wants to sell clothes and asked us to make 100 jackets for her to sell
Nokri (Marisa): within 1.5 weeks
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's insane. Is that even possible
Nokri (Marisa): if you're a sweatshop it is <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò≠
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This intern party started at 8
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The intern that was supposed to pick me up swears he‚Äôs on his way
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I should‚Äôve ubered or stayed over cried
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Me waiting outside: <:thenflourish:564838295108976680>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Me remembering alligators are active at night: <:then_perish:554720548274569246>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He swears he‚Äôs now 15 mins away
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Did he get you?
Bill: He doesn‚Äôt seem reliable at a party then. Make sure you have Uber on your phone.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye he got me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm pretty f‚Äôed up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): These nasa interns are so cool
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> Did you get home safely. You gotta be careful about getting ‚Äúf‚Äôup‚Äù when you don‚Äôt have people nearby who can watch your back, you just met these other interns, they don‚Äôt qualify.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Me: Maybe I should post my lineup on the CCE Facebook page to see if anyone else is matching up with me
Also me: Nah, that'd be kind of lame and attention-seeky
Me: But it'd be cool to meet some new people and make new frie--
Also me: YOU HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS TO KEEP TRACK OF AS IT IS
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol so remember that giant fucking 50 foot cable in the big ass conduit we had to make a couple months ago?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that weighed almost 200lbs?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): customer wants to know if we can reduce the price (after telling us at the beginning that cost wasn't going to be an issue for them)
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I‚Äôm good I got home at like 3
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I had a DD
Bill: Wasn't the driving I was concerned about. Be careful drinking around strangers. You can't trust them to take care of you if you get too far gone and, god forbid, can't trust not to take advantage of you. No offense to your internship friends.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Plz I know better than not to overdrink
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think the Hal incident scarred her from ever doing something like that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Bill: Don't have to drink that much before you miss someone putting something in a drink. Think like a pessimist with trust issues (thanks personality tests!). 

I just got worried, you may have been perfectly safe and I'm the ass for not trusting you to be, and if you weren't it's not a scolding. Just be safe, that's all. QED.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL THE HAL INCIDENT yeah I never want to be so bad that two dudes have to drag my naked ass somewhere
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I mean you did say "I'm pretty fucked up"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh never THAT bad tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): On my own sale

Pawlitics: Hahahaha omg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It took until Kurtis chimed in that I saw what Marisa was going for
Nokri (Marisa): Someone messaged me and I told him I was having fun ironing at the moment and he said ‚Äúyou must enjoy it because you‚Äôre a girl‚Äù and now I‚Äôm gonna murder
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Iron his face
Bill: kill.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): kill him absolutely
Aldus Larian (Jess): Murder is the only answer
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Just be like " you must enjoy being a complete dick because you have one then huh?" Then proceed to stab him
