Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so there’s this dumb ranking system professors have to do on grad school recommendations
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So if one prof gives a lot of recommendations, it means less weight/less help for you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So you’re unfairly punished by asking a popular professor for a recommendation
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So a bunch of physics kids were talking about it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And this one bitch (a known jerk) pushes up his glasses and goes “well we can’t ALL go to grad school”
