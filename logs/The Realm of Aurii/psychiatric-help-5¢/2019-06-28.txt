Bill: WOW tho. So. Chris and Meina got low key drunk at the social. Meina is totally okay with cheating on her boyfriend if it's to "follow her heart" and Chris is lowkey (actually lowkey) sexist, and believes the only reason not to cheat on your wife is cause it's too much effort.
Bill: Normies are SHIT
Bill: They were like, about to start INSULTING each other over "cheating isn't good cause common sense" versus "Cheat cause follow your heart" and then Meina suggested another bar and I was like 'sorry gotta go home but you guys have fun'.
Bill: Also according to Chris and Danny, men have no emotional connection to sex and women only do it if they want to be in a relationship.
Bill: Also shitton of commentary on if it's okay for a woman to sleep around since a man can in his 20's and still be considered 'prime material' for marriage around 30.
Bill: Danny and Chris were like "surrrrrreeeeee" "It's not GOOD but it's okayyyyy"
Bill: So.
Bill: This was amusing, normies are apparently shit. Good two hours of listening to discussion about this.
Bill: and now I get to drive home from Hoboken cause I drove in today.
Bill: (I'm good and sober)
Bill: But uh.
Bill: WOW what a trip.
Bill: Apparently love is 'just how I feel, I don't care how they feel I love who I love right now' or 'not love, I just respect my wife too much to ever cheat'.
Bill: I can't even.
Bill: Oh I forgot one more gem; men wanna fuck everyone. Period. Attractive to them or not. Just by seeing the back of a women, men wanna fuck. 

I‚Äôm so utterly appalled by these opinions I‚Äôm amused.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): After hearing horror stories about Matt's friends. This is a pretty universal normie ideology unfortunately
Bill: This is less amusing and more personally depressing after a sleep.
Bill: Uuu.
Aldus Larian (Jess): fuck all that
Tikur (Kurtis): It wack
Aldus Larian (Jess): I just? No?
Aldus Larian (Jess): like the idea that "men have no emotional connection to sex and women only do it if they want to be in a relationship." is so unhealthy for both men and women.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah that's fucked
Nokri (Marisa): fueled by a lack of education and the perpetuation of false stereotypes
Aldus Larian (Jess): like its not even a gender issue? there are *people* who want to have sex to have fun , and *people* who only want to have sex in a relationship
Aldus Larian (Jess): and people who dont want to have sex at all
and everything in between! AGH

Aldus Larian (Jess): damn i wish i had pee conjuring powers like men
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs why we go to the bathroom in packs, other women can help by shouting out directions to the bladder maze
Aldus Larian (Jess): we have to perform group seances to conjure the pee with our combined minuscule power
Nokri (Marisa): oooOOOOoooOo
Aldus Larian (Jess): the lack of sex education these people have had is terrifying
Nokri (Marisa): These are the people who become politicians owo
Nokri (Marisa): There was a story I read a few years ago about a girl who interned in DC and she wore a white skirt but got her period early and asked to go to the bathroom. Her boss was like ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm sick and tired of women trying to get out of work with their period‚Äù and she responded with something akin to ‚Äúok I‚Äôll just bleed all over my new skirt and the chair then‚Äù and the guy was like ‚Äúwait, you can‚Äôt control it? ??‚Äù
He had a wife and several daughters and he thought that people could just control when their period happened
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTFFF

Aldus Larian (Jess): like i just? how do argue online about things you have obviously done no research about or even asked about before?
Aldus Larian (Jess): like its really not hard to google "how does sex work?" "how do periods work?" "how do women get pregnant?"
Nokri (Marisa): they're clearly experts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Girlfriend ain't had period since got pregant"
Aldus Larian (Jess): like idk but if im gonna argue a point on the internet (which i dont do but like if i did) id make sure i knew what i "knew" first
Nokri (Marisa): or you could be like that guy who refuses to change his newborn's diapers when she's on her period
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Lmao ohNoooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): im sorry but like how sheltered were you to think like this?
Nokri (Marisa): when girls see one of these all-knowing studs walk up
