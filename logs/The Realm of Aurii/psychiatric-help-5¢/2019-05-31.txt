El🆓de Faun (Tom): I've just been stairing into space for 2 hrs yo
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I think half the reason i dont speak my mind when im upset about anything is i cant physically say the words without crying and interupting myself
Bill: Wow Jess is right you are adorable when you cry.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): marisa and i have communicated in me sending bitmojis of relevance and her reacting to them
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was gonna make a shitpost but it was for Marisa so there's no point in posting it 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): just send it straight to her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It makes me sad when she thinks she's bothering us ._.
Bill: Tell her that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wish her brain would stop being mean to her
Bill: She won’t listen.
Bill: ~~she cant listen~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I hate depression 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, I want to tell her but I know she won't listen. I also don't want to overwhelm her because I know we have good intentions of bombarding her with love but sometimes it can be overwhelming and have the opposite effect
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Depression sucks andd I hate it
Bill: I need to stop staying in suites.
Bill: The last time I stayed in a suite, it was the night Georgia told me about her parents divorcing and I didn’t sleep at all. I just paced in concern.
Bill: And that’s where we’re at now.
Bill: These hotels are jinxed.
Bill: Outside is not better. I walked into a tree branch distracted.
Bill: Marisa and a beer are getting me pretty close to that crying bar so there that, for anyone in the “he’s an emotional less robot” camp!
Aldus Larian (Jess): So only yourself?
Bill: “Unattractive cause he’s emotionless robot”?
Bill: Allllright I’m just dragging myself never mind.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm sad yo 👌
El🆓de Faun (Tom): This is gonna be like that episode of teen titans
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Where Starfire gets sent to the future
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And the Titans devolve and fall apart because Starfire is what held her together
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And she'll come back someday and find me, 50 yo beast boi in the circus
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Work tomorrow is gonna be rough
Bill: I’d complain that Rei is doing stuff on their own in BNE when it’s supposed to be democratic... but I just don’t care about BNE.
Bill: It’s only a half day but I dunt wanna go in to the building. 😭
Bill: The lots are mostly empty.
Bill: I think ibmers also work from home fridays a lot.

Bill: Barcade.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ~~b~~arcade
Bill: I mean yes, it's a bar, but they need to be to stay in business. As many machines as the place in Morristown and it's like a quarter a play.
Bill: You have to convert to tokens tho.
Bill: Workshop done, early lunch... call with Gord 12:30 to 1... think I’ll be bailing by 2.
Bill: Also watched the office maintenance staff freak out on a guy for plugging a power strip into a power strip.

Bill: <@!141729881779077121>
Andrew: Ou bou bucknam
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof I had a bad dream my dudes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I went to someone’s funeral and I couldn’t figure out who it was for
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I kept trying to figure out without explicitly asking but no one would tell me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I woke up and my palms hurt cause apparently my nails had been digging into them, my fists must’ve been clenched
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO 😭
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I know! I couldn’t find anyone at the service except Noah because he was apparently my +1 so I was so sad not knowing who it was for
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :(((((
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Bad dream 😭
Bill: Intern guy plays on a national soccer team in the Philippines.
Bill: Damn.
Bill: https://instagram.com/nicolewinhoffer?igshid=kdqj5vmv38ik and this is his sister? was on something called revenge body with Kim Kardashian?
Bill: This guy is like.
Bill: Damn.
Bill: Is this an actual like, rich kid scion?
Bill: Workshop officially called, so I might just yeet after this call with Gord.
Bill: God That sounds good.
Bill: I can go home.
Bill: Probably die for a bit.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): the hole in my nieces heart is causing her lungs to fill with fluid 😭
Glonk: You must have been seeking Justice in your dream, trying to find out who the killer was and if they showed up to the funeral. ...Was anyone wearing loafers by chance <:lenny:395307171539189760> ?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OH NO BABE
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): so still going with the plan for surgery within 2 weeks maybe sooner not sure
Glonk: At least with modern medical practice, she'll be fine in no time
Bill: Hopefully sooner.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah it'll be okay thats just so stressful
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea its like every time im like "cool shes fine" shes not fine 😭
Bill: Mood
Aldus Larian (Jess): I uhhh dont think thats really a mood but ok
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye doctors are smart people, they’ll fix her right up
Bill: I was thinking about Marisa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~its still not really a comparable situation~~
~~although both are very important~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Jess do you want some Oreos"
"No I'm good I'm trying to be better about my eating"
"Oh right bikini season is coming, that's why I'm glad I'm a man I don't have to worry about that"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lul what bro
Bill: Eyyyy guys can be ugly shirtless too
Aldus Larian (Jess): according to him they dont care tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): and im like "well i know guys that def care"
and hes like "oh cuz they're young"
Aldus Larian (Jess): so i was like "ok whatever im not gonna have a gender studies discussion over a cookie"
Bill: Long drives are not good when I’m already sad. 😭
Bill: Up(?)side, I can actually refute the numbers game/plenty of fish argument. It IS a numbers game, but rather than the numbers being dates it’s people who are actually willing to try a date. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: WHY is there traffic?!
Bill: Auuugh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So remember that issue I had with my customer concerning a miscommunication in cable? Probably not, but anyway they returned them for us to fix and I'm doing that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is what we sent which, as you can see, is really impractical looking
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is what it looks like fixed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which makes way more sense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Except I think they tried fixing it on their own first because the jacket had been cut in one spot and actually cut through one of the wires (dumbasses) so I had to put new wires in
Aldus Larian (Jess): that is a funky looking cable
but yours looks more logical at least
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Well, technically the first one is mine too because that's how I told production to make it based on how I misinterpreted their drawing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooo well the second one looks better! im gonna go ahead and blame their drawing <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good, that's the correct culprit
Aldus Larian (Jess): i had to whisper to my coworker (the one who sits outside my boss's office) twice today about borrowing period supplies and im wondering if hes gonna think i was like hiding something and then be like "WHAT WERE YOU @ TALKING ABOUT" cuz he does that
Aldus Larian (Jess): low key hope he does so i can make him really uncomfortable
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): MY VAGINA IS BLEEDING
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Omg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I just got a notification that Erik's vagina is bleeding
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And I just woke up so I was hella. Concerned
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OMG
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmfao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Did the nap help at least?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea it did xD now I'm just groggy lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's ok, my vagina ia fine now 👍🏻
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh good!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just told it to man up and stop being a pussy <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~will that work for me?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~if you believe hard enough,  maybe~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): My brother and sister in law are depressed cuz of everything with the baby. Depression better square tf up
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ://///
Bill: Can we kill depression?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: ~~anti depressants for everyone!~~
