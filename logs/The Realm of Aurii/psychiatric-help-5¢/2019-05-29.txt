Bill: One of the guys in the workshop has his phone set to a high pitched ding and it keeps going off at max volume.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I love Anna but like why does she take everything I say and make it her own and then take credit for it.... <:hmm:543194383885926403>

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I made a tweet about how I have so many jokes about anime con culture and weebs and how I want to do a roast

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like I know she looks up to me in some ways but like.... can you chill out with trying to steal my thunder in everything I do
Bill: *I'M GOING TO SMASH HIS PHONE HOLY FUCK*
Bill: Sorry yes.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm too exhausted as a person lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She also is taking full credit for the genderbend avengers idea even though it was me, georgia and Erik who started it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Which is hella annoying ngl
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *and she keeps recruiting*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:exhausted:577177500153544724>

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): Anna does that a lot I‚Äôve noticed ;u;
I gave her advice for an argument she was having on twitter and she wound up copying and pasting everything I wrote to post
Nokri (Marisa): Something something taste of her own medicine
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She doesnt think for herself a lot, but likes to be in charge. It bothers me.
Nokri (Marisa): The f is for you and the boi is for her
Bill: hmm.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üòÇ
Bill: She doesn't try and override me when I'm charge, I don't think.
Bill: There's been a few scenarios she could have recently.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): This isnt a diss, so dont take it as one. But, does she look up to you?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It seems like she does it to people she wants to be more like
Bill: You think it's related to that?
Bill: Hmm.
Bill: (No worries I see what you mean)
Bill: If she does it's photography but she only talks about using her camera and never does so. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Bill: I doubt it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea that's what I mean.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She doesnt seem too interested in photography so I can see how she wouldnt exactly look up to you in the same way
Bill: Ye. I was thinking about 'liking to be in charge' in a vaccum.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye, I getchu
Bill: And I believe someone said once Hunter finds me intimidating ~~hopefully just~~ when I'm running things so...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She loves to be in charge, dont get me wrong. But I think she likes it the most when its overpowering someone she thinks is better than her. Or by copying them
Bill: I was wondering if that's why she doesn't go up against me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I dont think you're intimidating
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Maybe when you're grouchy xD
Bill: I'm not sure if I want to be or not lol
Bill: I'm dying.
Bill: Too many data classifiers and I already have a headache
Bill: there needs to be a breeeeaaaaakkkkkk
Bill: wow this new guy "popped in" and I think he's an exec.
Bill: And when asked 'is there anything you want to add' he just spewed out a bunch of generic statements about the project.
Bill: Fakeist thing I've ever heard.
Bill: <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Pleas give me enough time to do the party on lunch I need a breakkkkk
Bill: I've completely zoned out as we approach hour 7 of the workshop.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): props to you for lasting that long
Bill: I didn't lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd've been gone after an hour
Bill: I don't remember a thing from the eco model discussion.
Bill: Everyone's slowing down though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn that's a long ass day
Bill: day 2 of 4!
Bill: And I really should stay at IBM for friday, cause if I was called into this I'd get *nothing* from it.
Bill: I woke up like 4 or 5 times last night, I just wanna sleeeeeep
Bill: Oh god this actual hell. 2 hours.
Bill: 2 more hours.
Bill: I dunno if I can keep from passing out, this isn't engaging content, it's 60% irrelevant to me and if I can't focus on it it may as well be white noise.
Bill: aaaaahhhhhhh
Bill: Apparently when I get tired I make. Breakthroughs in machine learning models.
Bill: Which.
Bill: Is odd.
Bill: Like, breakthroughs in public forums.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh it's hailing again. great
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): tornado watch
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE us too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if I die at work I'll be so pissed
Aldus Larian (Jess): not hail but tornado
Bill: wow when we came back from a break Sheema was like "so bill came up with an interesting model"
Bill: I'm not a data scientist, the fact that I came up with with this and it's possibly a serious plan for the next few months is kinda awesome.
Bill: I‚Äôm way smarter than I give myself credit for~~ ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Bill: Im committing to staying through Friday up here.
Bill: It‚Äôll suck gave 4 days of 8 hour meetings but phoning in just won‚Äôt work and the planning work is too key to let them handle alone.
Bill: Oof.
