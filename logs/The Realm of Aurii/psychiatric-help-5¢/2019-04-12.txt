Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just cannot bring myself to answer
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh God
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whomt
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *nuzzles you*
Is coming next
Bill: *don't!*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): *they missed you* have you ever even met them oh no
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My mom just shared an article about Amazon employing people to listen on your conversations
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Through Alexa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): where can i apply
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omgggg
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh noooo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Momma plz
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh no wonder it's written in a scare-baiting tone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's from the Daily Wire
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.dailywire.com/news/45879/amazon-employs-thousands-people-just-listen-your-emily-zanotti?%3Futm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=benshapiro
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is it true at all? Or is it just straight up bs?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~that shit probably in the terms of use but no one reads them~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I haven't properly fact checked it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but there is an option in the privacy settings to use it to help with voice recognition
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which can be disabled
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but whether they listen in even when you're not interacting with it, I have no idea
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ohhhh no my Amazon Alexa's going to hear my terrible singing, "what's for dinner", my groaning at things I don't want to do, terrible jokes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i know its fact that the listening feature is always on, i don't think they hired anyone to listen to you talk to alexa. But the OS is always listening, otherwise it would not be able to pick up "alexa, _____"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my entire history is "turn on/off my lamp" "turn on/off my stereo" and "play Spotify"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because that's all I use it for lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'm sure they use that information for data
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but like, idk, i dont understand the fear
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if youre not doing anything like...murder
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): then does it matter?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I guess if you're having in depth conversations concerning personal info?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): even if you were murdering people i dont think alexa would pick up on it lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but like I think there was like one (1) instance of someone saying something jokingly that alerted 911 or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I do t Alexa bit I have "ok Google" on my phone and it's the same shit I'm just kinda like "oh well"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, its in everything now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but if youre afraid of the personal info stuff...then how do you shop online or anything? like everything you do online takes personal info for the most part
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and im sure amazon/googl already have that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): BiG bRoThEr Is WaTcHiNg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fuck dude, he sure is
Aldus Larian (Jess): He's gonna be bored watching me
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn this bitch been sitting on her phone looking at memes for 3 hrs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"She's playing this game **again**???"
Bill: https://www.google.com/maps/timeline
Bill: If you're worried about big brother, that should be far scarier.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh shit dude
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea known about that for awhile
Bill: You can pause it. Still tracks locations, but based on check ins and maps directions.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): fuck it has all of my location history from back when my ex was living in Harrisburg...
Bill: You can also delete it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🎶 I always feel like, somebody's wacthin me 🎶
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I think I turned mine off since then because it doesn't show anything recent
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): all of these locations are from like 2015
Bill: As for smart devices, what matters is if they log the information they scan for trigger words.
Bill: Do they? Prooooobably.
Bill: But voice recognition isn't the most sophisticated are of language processing at the moment, and imagine going through about a million minute long clips trying to find information.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh also, I told my boss I'm doing the career day thing *today* and he got really excited about it, told me I didn't have to clock out, and wants me to try to get some kids to work here over the summer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that last part I'm like *no, I won't make those kids suffer*
Bill: "Run. Run you fools"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ha haha
Bill: https://giphy.com/gifs/maudit-maudit-gandalf-lord-of-the-rings-ONostKY8aj8bK
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean the production side probably isn't as bad because they don't really have to deal with our shitty mess of management
Aldus Larian (Jess): When people come here for interviews I just wanna be like "don't do it y'all"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just come in, sit at a bench and assemble, take breaks, have lunch, talk with people while you work
Bill: https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-1iSaZtCdYhxg4
Aldus Larian (Jess): i used to do that! as long as its not assembly line its not so bad but it can DRAG
Aldus Larian (Jess): conveyor belts *shudders*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I had an assembly job during my summer and winter breaks my first two years of college and it wasn't too bad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just had horrible sleeping habits so going to bed at 1-2am and waking up to get to work by 7am was not a fun time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but that was my own fault
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I liked the people I worked with
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Students? Work? 👀👀👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Kk still waitin on nasa
Bill: you work the summers.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Only cause I don’t have a job more relevant than car sales oof
Bill: Assembly isn't relevant to Jess's graphic design, and quickchek wasn't relevant to my Computer Science.
Bill: The point of summer jobs as a student is to learn work ethic.
Aldus Larian (Jess): neither was my making sandwiches, or selling shoes
Bill: ~~I say, having slept till 9 and starting work, at 9~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I just had a big freak out last night cause idk what I wanna do after college
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wanna go to grad school but I don’t feel good enough
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There’s some crazy talented kids in physics and I’m starting to get the impression that physics is the type of discipline that demands literally all your time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I don’t want a career like that
Bill: mmm... So at least to the not good enough, I wasn't an A student. I was far too comfortable getting Bs and Cs, as long as I was passing I was good. I got into grad school and made it through. You work a lot harder than I do, I am *sure* you'll be able to handle grad school. Just because you aren't one of the study robots that are so common in STEM doesn't make you lesser.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But grad schools are so competitive
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And im competing against the study robots for a spot
Aldus Larian (Jess): it depends on where you wanna go with it probably
Bill: They don't just look at your transcripts. They look at your other collegiate achievements, and they look at the letter you write which is going to be 100x better than the study robot's.
Bill: It cannot hurt to apply either. Rejections suck, yes, but they don't matter to your own worth.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeaaah I think nasa positions getting filled is starting to stress me out
Bill: If they don't realize what you can do, it's their loss from their alumni programs.
Bill: STEM does require work though... Admittedly I make it look lazy but my job is definitely unique thanks to Gord. IBMers work till 8 or 9 because they like(?) it and have meetings all day keeping them from doing any of the work.
Bill: IBMers are also... well, robots, and kinda weird by nature.
Bill: It's a weird company.
Bill: If you know what job title you'd be looking at, google it. See if you can find a reddit AMA for a NASA engineer.
Bill: But if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
Bill: *if you only like what you do, you'll be pretty neutral about your days but you aren't miserable*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): goals
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So for career day, they have an area set up for guests with food. Last year they had like hoagie trays and stuff. Since it falls in lent this year, I'm curious what meatless options they're going to provide
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably tuna salad 🤢
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Fight me with my tuna salad
Aldus Larian (Jess): why is my boss such a whiny baby man child
Aldus Larian (Jess): my boss went into the bathroom like 20 mins ago, maybe he died
Aldus Larian (Jess): dear coworker please finish your cookie before telling me how many days left until Columbus day 10 years from now, thanks
Bill: Lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): w....what
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea idk
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone save me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmmm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anger
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Love that bitch but sometimes Noah does so well in school I just want to die
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 4.0, 2 research positions, and now he just got handed the slot on physics club executive board
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That I had wanted
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof and ugh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugf
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh boi
Bill: You're going to have to work on not comparing yourself to him.
Bill: You'll drive yourself insane.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea trust me its no fun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I know I had this whole deal about not feeling good enough last night
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And now he drops that bomb that they just handed it to him today
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea ive been there, I still struggle with honestly. So i totally get what you mean
Aldus Larian (Jess): for me its about re-framing it into "us" although it may be too soon for you to do that just yet
Aldus Larian (Jess): if you stay together for the long term, his success is also yours
Bill: You don't give yourself enough credit Jess. I can't imagine Tom without you anymore tbh.
Bill: That may not be a success that comes with a trophy, but I wouldn't be as close to Tom (and you of course) if not for you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~this aint about me~~
Bill: So you've touched my life. ❤
Aldus Larian (Jess): thank
Bill: No it isn't, but I can still remind you you're amazing.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah it’s just so hard
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think we all struggle with feeling inferior sometimes, georgia. But, just because Noah has success doesnt mean you don't/won't as well. You're very talented and hardworking and incredibly smart too. 

The stress of waiting for internships probably is really hard to deal with right now too.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I feel like I’m working my ass off and not getting results
Bill: You're in the same field as Noah, and comparing yourself to him is going to be as toxic for your mood as comparing yourself to the drop outs from freshman year. You have you own skills, talents, and specialities in your field. Learn those and be proud of them. Accept that there are things you aren't good at too.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmm class has started but I’m hiding in the bathroom til I can calm down
Bill: I would have failed out of grad school if I didn't acknowledge Nick and John were just better than me in mathmatic based topics. It's a hard lesson to bite down on, *prideful Leo* as you are. I know, as another *prideful leo*.
Bill: Look at *Georgia.*
Bill: Not Noah.
Bill: Unless it's his ass or whatever.
Bill: then look at his. 😛
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It just makes me so not excited for physics
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I used to really like it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Now I just feel like I can’t do it
Bill: As I recall, you told us you were in the upper percentage of your test grades for the class last weekend.
Bill: That's not someone who can't do.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And now I’m cryin in the bathroom stall like a total cliché 😞
Bill: 😭
Bill: If there's anything I could do for you I would.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ok for now I need to calm down so I can go back to class
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How do
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): deep breaths and water
Aldus Larian (Jess): deep breathes
Bill: deep breathes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye that leanna got this
Bill: *lol breathes*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i find drinking something helps more than breathing, at least for me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it regulates your breathing patterns
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea water for sure
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Looking at lights I think is supposed to help too?
Bill: Weeby as fuck, but draw `人` on your palm.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): can you go outside for a minute?
Bill: It's a japanese idiom for stress.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Billiam I have a phone and a bathroom stall
Bill: With your finger goofball.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): get some fresh air and sun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Theoretically but I need to get to the point of no more tears to exit said stall
Bill: The feeling of your finger on your palm is strangely relaxing.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s mostly ticklish
Bill: gives you something to focus on other than your thoughts.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Staring at the light helps
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I am moth
Aldus Larian (Jess): just dont hurt your eyes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah they don’t pay for bright lights at this school
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thank god I can play most of this off as allergies
Bill: 
Bill: 
N🆗ri (Marisa): not very helpful but if you need an immediate anti-cry fix try pinching between your thumb and pointer finger, or splashing your face with water
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh no but I have the make ups
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _chilis memes_
Bill: *blessed by Chilis*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Does chilis actually not serve chili?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wtf
N🆗ri (Marisa): i forget the word for it but there's a scientific reaction where if you have water on your skin it has a calming effect and alters certain functions so even if you avoid your eyes the water on face might help
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh oh yea! whats that called
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like cuz we used to live in da womb
Bill: *fuck it us*
Bill: https://www.redbubble.com/people/lukowskisar/works/29619404-hi-welcome-to-chilis-vine-meme?p=t-shirt
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have acquired drink
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thank you mom for putting money on my school ID
Bill: what are they called at rutgers?
Bill: Is it as cringe worthy as Boro Bucks?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao ruexpress
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not THAT bad
Bill: How you?
Bill: We aren't far away Georgia, and never. If you need us, for a shoulder or a distraction... we'll be there. ❤
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE BOI
Aldus Larian (Jess): GURL*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > annoying co-worker comes into my office
> needs to pause After Story
> she starts blabbing about how she was disappointed about the grand re-opening of one of our local grocery stores because "It looks the same as last week!" ~~no shit, the grand opening isn't the day after they finish remodeling~~
> starts talking about how much she doesn't want to work and just hang out with her friends
> *omg get the fuck out of my office*
> "I'm just gonna bug you for like, 5 more minutes"
> *audibly grinds teeth*
> I continue working, ignoring her while she yaps about all the movies she wants to see
> *get. the fuck. OUT. of. my office*
Aldus Larian (Jess): what. a. mood.
Bill: Glam Choi is that you?
Bill: That could be tonight too Georgia, if it’s what need. I can get dust candy for Hazel at any FYE after all.
Bill: Someone make sure to remind me to do a video of dumping a whole bag of dust candy in my mouth like an addict, by the way.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thanks guys 💕
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And nah it’s okay I’m going home for dinner tonight
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think getting out of the Rutgers bubble helps
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bill, screaming and then dumping pop rocks into his mouth
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): True patreon content
Bill: Mhmm. Burrow into the couch and watch a movie.
Bill: ~~you plan on subscribing~~
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: God. The thought of a meme patreon filled with things no one wants to see but the selling of it is SO good people subscribe anyway to be in on it.
Bill: Sheema wants me to go to Armonk mondayyyyy
Bill: 😭😭😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bless my short week next week
Aldus Larian (Jess): I almost called out today. almost
Bill: Why short week?
Aldus Larian (Jess): We get off good friday
Bill: Oh damn.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): SHE CAME BACK
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Well, it's the last half hour of the day..."*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yes it is, please leave
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Thank fuck she left
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn son
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is she just bored or what
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because it's Friday and we're the only ones that stay the whole day
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Honestly don't know why she does
Bill: ~~or thirsty~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she comes in at 7 every day like the rest of production
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm pretty sure she's said before that she's a lesbian
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, hard pass
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she's like in her mid 30s but looks like she's straight out of college
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that perpetually young looking Asian thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): She doesn't get in trouble for like being around you with no purpose?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): boss man peaced out like 2 hours ago
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she's our person that handles purchasing materials so we usually have to talk when it comes to upcoming projects and quotes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and it was one of those things where I used to enjoy talking to her but then she got progressively more annoying
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ohhhh oo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I get that 😂 there used to be a woman here like that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she likes nerdy stuff and is a veteran weeb so we clicked on stuff like that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but now she comes to talk to me just about every week about upcoming movies she plans on seeing and new places she ate at
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like "ok cool?"
Bill: “How are you Mr Han”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I'm just like *I really couldn't give less of a shit, please leave so I can go back to talking to my friends on Discord*
Bill: LOOOIOOLLL
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea alot of people talk to be about shit I couldn't care less about and Im just like LEAVE
Bill: Mood cause our office expanding has Given me a chance to make office friends, but I really don’t want to and would much rather sit on Discord all day then talk to my coworkers.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sometimes I'm like downright rude even but they just come back
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I had people I truely did like working with and was friends with but they all get fired or get fed up and quit so not I almost try not to make friends here
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I've cried because my friends leaving here like at least 3 times so now I'm like
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nope
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've started just looking up and saying "What's up" as if I'm expecting something work-related and when it's not then I just kind of look back at my computer and pretend like I'm working on something while she blabs. Then when she's done talking, she looks at stuff on her phone in silence for like... *a good while* until she finally leaves
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hold that thought for a second:
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ok carry on
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are you *sure* shes a lesbian
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wh
Did he really post that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also LMFAO leanna
N🆗ri (Marisa): Owait did you add the picture
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea she added it
Aldus Larian (Jess): I still have like 9000 things to do but my boss left so I'm just staring into space
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg I got that notification and I was like w h a t
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dropped my highlighter pallete and it broke and now I'm big sad
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's pretty new
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Use alcohol to mush it back together
Aldus Larian (Jess): The case broke too 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Use alcohol to ease your pain
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): can you tamp it back together
N🆗ri (Marisa): tamp tamp
Bill: Yo I’m on Kirsten’s close friends list?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Who's that
Bill: The Neo cosplayer who I did shoot via Georgia with.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ohhhh
Bill: She was nice enough but we haven’t done more than wave to each other since that one shoot. 😂
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I FIXED THE CASE GUYS
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just after Jess left
Elfriede Faun (Tom): All is right with the world
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thank babe
Bill: Fuck me sideways Atkins bars are 8.99 now.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know this person named hori and they're an artist who teaches people how to draw and he gets a lot of foreign clients and posts his stuff on instagram, and someone was scolding him on insta for using bad english grammar
when are people gonna wake up and realize that people don't learn english for the sake of speaking english
Bill: Never. People are dumb online.
