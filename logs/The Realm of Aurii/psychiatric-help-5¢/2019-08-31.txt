Bill: I almost passed out in chili’s and am being checked out in the ER now. Something to do with my blood pressure dropping. 🙃 Feel pretty much fine now.
Bill: 🙃
Bill: Parents with me tho, glad I went to dinner with them.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn :/ hope everything is all good then
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh shit, hope you're ok
Tikur (Kurtis): Oh shit, you aight?
Nokri (Marisa): how did you feel during dinner? 😱
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): whoa yeah i hope everythings alright
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Holy shit <@184437198865563648> hope you're okay 😟
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also you too <@245270932602486784>
Bill: I had my heart racing at first, noticed and watched my heart rate being high on my watch. Then it tanked from 120 to 59, which made me light headed and clammy which is when we tried to leave. The dizziness in doing that had me unable to see and I sat down, mom called 911... started to feel better by the time the ambulance showed. Still had another drop in pressure while I was sitting still getting checked in the ambulance, so here we are.
Bill: Been a time.
Bill: Have no idea what the hell happened.
Nokri (Marisa): ooo it's really good you had that heart monitor
Nokri (Marisa): you'll probably be there all night, but at least it's safe
Nokri (Marisa): are your parents staying there with you?
Nokri (Marisa): also georgia idk where you are in the path of the hurricane but make sure you have spare water (maybe freeze some plastic bags and containers) and fill up any tubs/buckets/containers you have with water so you have stuff to drink and things to flush/clean your hands with if the power and water go out
Bill: Should be able to leave if the tests come back fine. Parents stayin.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yup! i have a case of water, 2L bottle of water, a flashlight, a lantern, extra batteries, a battery radio and extra foods!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh jeez I hope everything is ok
Bill: Tests all came back normal. “Near Syncopse Unknown cause”. So basically they said “this just happens.”
Bill: So I’m heading home, probably going to my parents for the night to not tempt fate.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): body went "404 cannot response" on you
Nokri (Marisa): Wow that was fast
Bill: It was unusually so.
Bill: I mean, from what others tell me. I have not spent any time in a hospital.
Bill: Mom said it was a really quick turn over.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What hospital?
Bill: Dover st Claire’s.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo never been there
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea that's really fast. Like I'm jealous because when I was in a hospital last I thought I was dying and yet it still took 2 hours before they even had a doctor see me and another 2 hours before I got morphine for pain <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Glad you are ok though
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Hope it doesnt become a normal thing for you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh i went to the hospital once and it only took an hour
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): did our moms karen us into special treatment
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: No, just the way it happened.
Bill: Thanks all and please god I don’t need randomly passing out as a trope.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Maybe instead you'll randomly power up
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Sudden onset of super powers
Bill: Nah fam.
Bill: But I’m not dead so. That was pretty spook in the moment.
Bill: Gotta make an appointment for a cardiologist (Dad has one) to rule out some rare edgecases but I guess I’m fine. Gotta change my allergy meds too, unrelated, since they’re apparently not working.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So it’s been a while since I’ve been on my gossip BUT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Looks like Hal couldn’t find anyone to stay with for CCE til he asked Peter
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wonder what happened to Delaware squad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Idk. I know he and Meg are doing casual BNHA at some point because Meg asked if I wanted to join them for that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I'm taking care of my sister's cat while they're away this weekend and HOLY SHIT am I ready to be on my own schedule after moving out 

Like, every weekend my family has the same routine and even though I'm in no way obligated to join them, since I live at home still, I feel like I should? But it's been getting very tiring these past few months and my mom's always farting around getting ready in the morning that by the time we're all ready to go to brunch, it's like 11 and the day is half gone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But today I was up around 8, showered, got ready, went to the farmer's market myself to pick up breakfast for myself as well as something for my sister, picked up a package at the Amazon locker, went to my sister's, tok care of the cat, ate my breakfast, watered their plants, and chilled on their back porch for like half an hour.

I just got home and my parents are just leaving for the farmer's market and I'm like, wow I already have been up and doing shit today, this is nice
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeeee
Bill: Yeaaaah I know that feeling.
Bill: I had the same thing.
Bill: Gotta switch to decaf. Good I bought some for the apartment so Tom would have something to drink when he visits. XD
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao niceee
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Although I drink decaf only at night
Bill: That was the intention yeah.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Welp, replaced my tablet battery
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Turns out the battery was not the issue
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So. I'm calling it dead.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): now to see if I can return the battery kit and get a refund
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then gotta go take my laptop to Best Buy for recycling
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe this is the universe helping me purge the last remnants of my ex from my life since she bought me this tablet...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): only matter of time before the xbox goes too...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and the keurig...
Aldus Larian (Jess): :o
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and turns out in the 4 years I've had it, barely any of the things I saved and photos I had on it were saved to the SD card <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok well, camera photos seem to be there but mostly everything else was saved to the device which can no longer be accessed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :///////
