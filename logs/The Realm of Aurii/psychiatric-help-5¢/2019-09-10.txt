Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've reached a point of not caring about getting quotes approved by my boss because I never know if or when he's coming in so I'm just sending them off on my own whoops
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, I have a list if things that *need* to get done before I leave tomorrow but other shit keeps popping up that's preventing me from getting to it 😡
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And it's like really dumb shit that's becoming a bigger deal than it should be
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Group lead: "This gasket on this cable isn't as tight as it usually is, can we add a zip tie to prevent it from falling off?"
Me: "Let me ask the customer..."
Customer: "How many assemblies is this affecting?"
Me: "All of them"
Customer: "Take a few measurements of the cable OD from 3 different assemblies"
😑

when i removed the gauze from the bloodwork earlier there was a LOT more than usual, usually it's like a pinprick but i think i kept bleeding out while wandering around walmart
Bill: Maybe they did a poor insertion. =/
Bill: That happened to me once.
Nokri (Marisa): and then everything (4 hours of sleep + no food + loss of blood + walmart + no medication because i couldn't eat + dehydration probably because i never drink lol) kind of added up and messed me up. bojo came back from her first job and said i looked way too pale so cancelled her second job for the night
Nokri (Marisa): the blood taker today was really really nice but she seemed new so maybe?
Nokri (Marisa): i don't recall seeing her before
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea you need some food and water for sure.
Nokri (Marisa): i got a shower using only water <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): i didn't get a lot of sleep last night but i did get to watch sylvia jump from the third floor to the second floor a few times
