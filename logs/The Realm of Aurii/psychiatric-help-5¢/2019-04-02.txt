Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I'm doing the career day thing at my high school again and I'm replying to emails to people I've known since I was a kid and I'm trying hard to remember that I'm an adult now and don't have to call them Mr./Mrs. so-and-so anymore and can use their first names xD
Bill: Lol mood. I’m having that problem cause my parents refer to family friend with first names, and I’m doing it, but when they’re around I’m like wait what do I call you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): dear coworker, PLEASE STOP TELLING PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE ABOUT TEAM VIEWER
Bill: lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): youre gonna have to murder them, it's the only way
Aldus Larian (Jess): like???? are u dumb
Bill: why tho?
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz i goof off all day and its the only thing that makes this job bearable
Bill: looool
Bill: you teamviewer to home?
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just know what it is
Bill: Was going to say, I used to use it alot (less so cause my primary machine is a laptop and not on all the time) but it's not great for goofing off. Too slow.
Bill: I just fuck around on my work machine.
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: I asked Gord what I could put on the work machine and straight up said "anything but child porn".
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont wanna be watched D:
Aldus Larian (Jess): weather its while working or goofing off
Bill: ooooh, yeah, no, your boss is too fucking dumb to use teamviewer to monitor your machine.
Bill: Teamviewer is for remote controlling, not snooping. There's better software for that iirc.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but his son isnt
Bill: he's coo though right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye but i still dont think hed appreciate me literally spending 7/8 hrs a day on tumblr, discord, amazon, etc
N🆗ri (Marisa): peeps who're cool can still be super freaky and have weird habits
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >.> oh god same
Bill: 
Bill: I literally dedicate my entire second screen to chats XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): woah why discord look so big
hi biru's workplace
N🆗ri (Marisa): you don't have aurii at the top <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: True I don't.
Bill: ... why tho, Jared's server is pointless.
Bill: I couldn't move it now though.
Bill: Aurii, BNE, and ASPN can't move cause I click them all the time and if they shifted I'd get super confused.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow your desk is so clean
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): das mine
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Me: selects "prefers to be organized" on every personality test
> Also me:
Bill: I don't do alot with paper being in tech. Probbaly helps.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i really gotta go through those vitamins and get rif of some
Bill: oof your desk looks like hell.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah... needs a cleanup badly
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mines somewhere between jess and erik
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have to clean my dek off and put everything away at the end of each day or i go nuts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I always get it organized and then work starts piling up and I end up just putting shit wherever and yeah...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so many waters <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Nice full screened discord.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😄
Aldus Larian (Jess): stay hydrated
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hey! same paper rack!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just different colors
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA
Bill: Yo what do you need all that *stuff* for.
Bill: Like, I can't imagine using more than the one pen and pad I have.
Bill: You and Erik, like, just the concept of not doing everything on my computer is foreign to me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my favorite part of my desk is the fragile box full of CBD that one of my sales reps gave me for free because i  "looked stressed"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that i havent touched since she gave me it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and its just been sitting there for like 4 months
Aldus Larian (Jess): NICE
Bill: Lol a desk phone.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh and bill, i have a lot of catalogs for pet suppliers and everything here is done by printing shit out
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this place is like 30 years in the past
Bill: It looks out of the Office tbh.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): except my boss isnt likable in any sense
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...and neither are any of my coworkers
Bill: ~~everyone after Micheal wasn't so~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😄
Aldus Larian (Jess): prob cuz when u work in an office everyday people come give stuff on paper
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~true~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have alor of paper also its just in my desk
Bill: I have to travel with my work too. I work from three different desks in any given week.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and i tend to go through it and throw stuff out every other week or so
Bill: So that can contribute to my clean desk.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats why you dont have paper. my boss is 80 he can barely opperate word
Aldus Larian (Jess): he will print a news article out and give it too me, ask me to use a stat on the article and when i ask for a link instead hes like ????
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh, word?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I print a lot of stuff out because it's easier for me for writing notes
Bill: I only use paper for frantic brainstorming.
Bill: Usually I need the ability to manipulate what I'm looking at when it comes to data.
Bill: But I work in big data so.
Bill: I write out code logic though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): but the best is when he types up multiple paragraphs then prints it, doesn't save the file, but instead prints it, gives it to me to retype into a new document instead of just emailing it to me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Bill: OOF
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats my life
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then ill get yelled at for making spelling errors
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Invest in this: https://smile.amazon.com/Scanmarker-Digital-Highlighter-Scanner-Version/dp/B072MKKJFP/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=pen+scanner&qid=1554216329&s=gateway&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or something similar that's cheaper
Aldus Larian (Jess): i should
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): see if you can write it off as a business expense lol
Bill: I also have view.
Bill: ya'll don't have much nerd stuff on your desks.
Aldus Larian (Jess): o i had mroe but i took alot home on a day i almost quit XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): my desk when i work at home is literally just a pule of nerd stuff
Bill: Well you're at home of course.
Bill: My desk at home is much messier.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): organization at its finest
Bill: I got the neirs and totoro, plus...
Bill: 
Bill: which is not the impression I should give off to my workplace but it so true.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've guit Post-It Nopes
Aldus Larian (Jess): I made them buy wme a bulletin board so I could do this
Bill: OH CROP
Aldus Larian (Jess): which i need to re do and add prints from cons
Bill: I"M DEAD
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): i also have this one
N🆗ri (Marisa): jay peg
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: *Peg Jay* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): and this one
Bill: I'm very proud that every desk photo posted has Discord on the monitor.
Bill: Jess and Leanna win for having Aurii first.
Aldus Larian (Jess): babys first server
N🆗ri (Marisa): my aurii is at the bottom because it was the first server i joined :3c
Bill: oh? Wasn't Jared's first?
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah
Bill: You know you can reorder them right Mawisa?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i got discord for this
N🆗ri (Marisa): but if aurii is the first why would i reorder it
N🆗ri (Marisa): every time i join a new server i'd have to move them again
Bill: I dunno why I'm still in the other servers I have tbh... I never go to them.
N🆗ri (Marisa): You can see the cursed third floor from here and it’s ceiling to floor anime coverage above one of the wig boxes
Bill: Megatokyo cause if I wanna talk to them I gotta open irc, Sakimi I'
N🆗ri (Marisa): lewd chat
Bill: Ash's group should make a group DM rather than a server.
Bill: Yes, lots of lewd.
N🆗ri (Marisa): where's the nsfw yaoi
N🆗ri (Marisa): gender equality
Aldus Larian (Jess): now im looking at design memes
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: ~~it was hidden cause I muted it~~
Bill: There's so many people in that server I just don't care though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think i got cat saliva in my eye <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): not recommended, going to disney is much better
Bill: Sakimi has an entire channel dedicated to commission pricing help. <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: And it looks like the irc group has not transition to discord so Megatokyo is pointless.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG STAPLES PROMOTIONAL SITE GOT WORSE
Aldus Larian (Jess): i click on "blue" its fucking bring purple
N🆗ri (Marisa): blurple
Aldus Larian (Jess): this is like fucking magenta!
Aldus Larian (Jess): its supposed toe be dark blue
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fucking yikes
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg that's as blue as my hair is green
N🆗ri (Marisa): i mean. maybe they were looking at a rainbow and got really confused and went "go lower. lower. yeah that's a good dark blue." "that's purple." "no it's under light blue so it might be dark blue."
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's symbolic. it's symbolic of people playing V (blue)'s route, and yet pining for ray (magenta) the entire time. according to aristotle, the matter is
Bill: ~~bashing ya'll for dumping V for Ray is my job~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): my cowoker comes in and is like "why are u looking at magenta shirts?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): im like "its blue"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hahaha
Aldus Larian (Jess): low key wanna be responsible for a class ful of guys getting stuff with pink shirts but also not
Aldus Larian (Jess): "neon yellow"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Shaggy green
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's exactly what neon yellow looks like when my glasses are dirty and i have a black veil over my face and the lighting is weird
Aldus Larian (Jess): I shouldn't be trusts with light color pants
Aldus Larian (Jess): prayer circle im allowed to order through custom ink and safe myself trouble and worry that these shirt will show up in magenta <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m tryna contribute to the desk discussion but I don’t have a work desk lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): your thread rack is so pretty
N🆗ri (Marisa): your desk is something out of a furniture catalogue
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): woah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thank ☺️ I live an aesthetically driven life
Bill: While I'm clearing photos out from my phone cause I wanna replace mine. 

Left is like, last week, right is end of year vacation, so just before I started dieting. Not that much difference. =/
Aldus Larian (Jess): Me:"I cant use staples site it suck to bad can i use custom ink?"
Boss: "yea you can get them from there, use the staples account"
Me: "thats not how this works"
Bill: shame,
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive seen the difference in person tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): the jacket on the left seems thicker but there's still a difference
Bill: Bout the same.
Bill: I could be change blind but I just. can't trust Mom/Katy/Doctor saying 'you look great' cause I know they'd be supportive no matter what. XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): your face has definitely slimmed down quite a bit, and there are definite other changes in general too.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you're doing well, give yourself some credit
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea ive def noticed a change
Bill: Thank.
Bill: 😊
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye face definitely slimmed down!
Bill: It's not really discouraging, to be clear. I'm actually pretty comfortable doing things as I have. Picky eating weaponized.
Bill: I forgot to check this morning, but I think it’s 24 pounds now so...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yoo good job!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wooo
Tikur (Kurtis): Woo!!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah can def tell
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Even in the pictures
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Changes order to “no spicy mustard, mayo instead”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Gets double spicy mustard
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thanks Panera
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bill, if you want to subtly give Rebecca photog advice, you can always ask her to help you with shoots and then you can spread your wisdom by explaining things you have her help you with <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: We've just about broken the barrier. iirc she's been shooting longer than me, I don't want to act like I'm better than her unless she... is okay with that? ~~I must confirm senpai status before I act senpai~~
Bill: Which I will, when it comes to photography and teaching.
Bill: We'll see what happens.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just because she's been shooting longer doesn't necessarily mean she has more experience. I think you might have more because you shoot more frequently than she does. You also have a lot more tech knowledge since you've had a better camera longer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so like, you'd probably know more about different camera settings and whatnot
Bill: Yeah, I'm not underselling myself, I just don't want to 'asset' my superiority cause that rude and could hurt her self esteem shooting.
Bill: ~~there is one photographer I consider myself rivaled by, Rebecca is not them~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Who dat
Bill: I'll tell you if you guess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): your evil twin
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Our wedding photographer <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Nah. Though I had major lens envy. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is it Ben cause of that one pic?
Bill: ~~fuck~~
Bill: ye.
Bill: He good. He full time photog iirc, but still good.
Bill: (also to be clear, rivaled by just means I'm like, jealous by their existence. Everyone on the lists I've made is good, that's a given.)
Bill: (I'm looking at you Marisa)
N🆗ri (Marisa): saywhatnow
i hide behind a fake potted plant
N🆗ri (Marisa): roll for disguise
Bill: *I wonder if I'm so jealous cause it's Georgia, or cause of the photo.*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That one photo is pretty lit 🤔 but he literally climbed into a tree to get some of those fall Pyrrha pics
Bill: It's the one photo I hate so much.
Bill: *Sigh* it's probably because it you. Photo is great, but I guess I've had a thing for taking the best photos of you. I should shake that.
Bill: I wonder if the same thing would happen with Tom and Jess, since I shoot them as much as you. ~~They've never shot with anyone else as good as me so we don't know~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye Ben is really odd
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s got like the hunter “I would like to be photographer full time” attitude but he’s really shy and doesn’t have any friends
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like he has his own website and networks well but he’s too afraid to reach out
Bill: You do have a habit of dragging shy people into things.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pew:543202259085950996> that’s the georgia way
Aldus Larian (Jess): we shot with our wedding photag
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ben also has a job at his dads construction company and makes bank so he has a lot of rich kid tech
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think he recently started selling his car tho so idk man
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But when hal and I met him at the balloon festival the biggest trait was that he seemed shy and lonely
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And excited to make friends
Bill: *yes, you have a habit of finding those people*
Bill: *cough*
Bill: Only you could find a diamond in the rough photographer on a date at a balloon festival.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My photo-dar
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah it’s more like shy-people-dar
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BUT the camera is a good talking point so I don’t feel too shy myself
Bill: *ew cringe*
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's the context is that just a random cosplayer from the photo
N🆗ri (Marisa): is byakko the other neo
Bill: that is the guy whose got a rwby oc, won't shut up about it, followed *everyone* from the shoot, attempted to friend me (and I believe everyone else) on facebook when the shoot was created, dumped his sob story on Georgia when thanking her for the shoot...
Bill: Just.
Bill: One of those dude.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh oh gosh wow
N🆗ri (Marisa): am glad i didn't wear blake that day <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I am not.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mood marisa
Bill: Neeeever thought there'd be a scenario I'd be happy to be mistaken as Georgia's boyfriend, but so long as he thinks that hopefully he doesn't become an Austin or something.
N🆗ri (Marisa): who's austin 👀
Bill: Creepy guy from over a year ago.
Bill: *Ethan likes him though*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He tried to bad touch
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We don’t like Austin
Bill: ~~Time to go Jumin Han on Georgia to keep her away from creeps~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uhhh?
