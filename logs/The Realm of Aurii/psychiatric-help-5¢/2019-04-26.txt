Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was a fool and woke up this morning to insufficient quantities of underwear for the weekend so I had to start laundry this morning
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Insufficient quantities of underwear, that‚Äôs an album title if I ever heard one right there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But yeah you might wanna do that

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I took a few bits and was like *this does not taste normal*
Aldus Larian (Jess): why cant my boss understand that every time he interrupts me it kills productivity?
NüÜóri (Marisa): Have a voodoo doll and stab it every time he enters to prove your point
Aldus Larian (Jess): like i got back from lunch and got back in the groove of converting these 6 manuals from quark to indesign (which takes forever) and hes like "hey stop doing that and lets have a meeting right now"
Aldus Larian (Jess): like bittchhhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ethan said to bring my guitar so he can show me stuff
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do I actually tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): all these updates need to be done for like an $80,0000 order "asap" but he wants me to design 3 fucking post card mailers
Aldus Larian (Jess): you should def forget it
NüÜóri (Marisa): Oh no
Accidentally forget guitar
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): do not
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh God please no
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): by "show you stuff" he probably means "watch me play this death metal song and try to guess what it is"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Please dont subject yourself to Ethan " helping"
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea seriously, dont bring it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ethan has already expressed to me that he will be "sloshed"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And I just went...."...ok"
Aldus Larian (Jess): like upon arrival?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): great way to start a party someone threw for you
Bill: *you forced someone to throw for you
Bill: Oh man I was just thinking man today kinda dragged. But now I have the the fact I don't have to list to Ethan *talk* for 6 hours to comfort me.
Bill: bah. But I have laundry and packing a back to do.
Bill: I just wanna play minecraft all night.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He asked me if I was excited and I said I have a headache thanks to the weather. And he said alcohol fixes everything and that he was gonna get sloshed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like... lmao... ok then
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof
Bill: <:5142_then_perish:554720548274569246> <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): if ethan asks why im not there just tell him it was too late of a night for me with the con in the morning and also allergies are kicking my ass.
Aldus Larian (Jess): not lies but ya know
Bill: hmmu
Bill: He won't ask.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): If he asks I'll be shocked
Bill: But do I care what his opinion of me is.
Bill: sigh, probably since he's involved with you lot I have to play nice.
Bill: are we doing anything for sure on Sunday?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Going home
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom and i prob not gonna stay over
Bill: oh?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Depending how tired I am after cpac I might head home afterwards. I really need to finish arryns robe and I dont really have time during the week xD so Sunday is like prime work on costume day
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But I'm not 100% certain yet, just fair warning
Bill: So sunday isn't a hang out day, and saturday night could be a bust. Erik leaving in the morning and I could head home.
Bill: hmm.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Saturday night is mostly for people to not have to drive home late at night
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I won‚Äôt be offended if everyone leaves Saturday night anyways
Bill: Hmm. Then I don't really need to stay. Not that'd mind, for friendship and all that jazz. But don't really need to.
