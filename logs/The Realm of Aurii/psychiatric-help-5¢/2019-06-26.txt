Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I got a hit on Hinge... she commented on my Jumin wine cosplay photo with "Hey handsome"
> looks at profile
> every photo has snapchat filter, pass
> sees she smokes and partakes in the marijuana,hard pass
> sees she went to my high school, curiosity is piqued
> searches Facebook and finds her
> the name vaguely rings a bell 
> remembers that she did theater like once and was annoying AF and the only thing I can really remember is her talking about getting underwear and super expensive perfume from Victoria's Secret
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so overall, a very "yikes, hard pass" hit on Hinge
Bill: lol. How'd it go with Kirishima girl?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): uhh.... convo died
