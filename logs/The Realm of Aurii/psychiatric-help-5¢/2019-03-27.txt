Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): a bit better. made it into work at least. trying to sleep last night was awful despite going to bed before 11 and having taken NyQuil
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my whole nose was stuffed so I couldn't breathe except through my mouth which I think my body has been trained not to do while sleeping
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh nooo 😦
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I went to bed around 10:30-10:45ish and woke up the first time about an hour later... then again about quarter after 12... then again around 3...

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like you ate something bad?
Bill: Special fuck you to the guy presenting a problem to me and sheema but is too freaking stupid to show all the files that explain the problem on the screen share.
Bill: "I'll just explain it"
Bill: *No dumbass we work on big data*
Bill: I feel bad for saying it but I just. can't follow a strong indian accent. The words blend together and I lose track of the sentence.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's tough. I have a customer from India that sometimes calls me and I have a hard time understanding him
Bill: Sheema's accent isn't too bad but this other guy has a strong one and the two together is just damn.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i make it a point to make a joke about it with hopes that he will be like "ah yes maybe this is a problem"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like a joke at his expense >.>
Bill: I always saw him in sweatpants, just assumed he was that type of guy.

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Was it Rebecca?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i went back and checked the website but it doesn't say <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah Rebecca had me!
Aldus Larian (Jess): And I had had her! 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): watch it be Hunter
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm already mad at him for ignoring me and starting beef <:hmmph:543192410402848769> if it's him i'mma be infuriated
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, i would be thankful, but if it is him and he's just continued to ignore me that just rubs salt in the wound
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hunter had ethan i think
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which is hilarious
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea he did cause he kept asking me what he should get him and i was like "dude idk, some waifu thing"
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg
Bill: that checks out.
Bill: I remember that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): who did ethan have? what did they get lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): was he at the party or was he in texas?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he had monica
N🆗ri (Marisa): oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hope she got nice stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): she deserves beautiful and nice things
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think he got her something Salem-related
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like a t-shirt or something
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea a salem t shirt, he sent it to me as well as a gift for rei
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and a yikes shirt for me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which ... is fitting, but then i felt obligated to buy him something
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dang social customs
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why do I feel like it was Snow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I had snow and I don’t remember who she had
N🆗ri (Marisa): the mystery continues <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I know hunter had ethan
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ethan had Monica
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Did Casey have you?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): casey mightve had marisa, you might be right
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): In which case whoever had Casey left the gift for her at my house
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I have her gift hostage￼
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow I just woke up from a nap so that was some good deducing
Bill: ~~Keep it hostage till she breaks it off with Ethan~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): So forever?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: It’s win win. You either save Casey from a lifetime with Ethan via the magic of Christmas, or you get a 10-20 dollar gift for nothing!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hmm those things seem inequal in value but ok
