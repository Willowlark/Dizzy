Aldus Larian (Jess): I might be wrong I check receipt later if I can find it
Nokri (Marisa): i'd store it in my house
i can put them in boxes/totes on my bed
in plastic wrapped totes in the backyard
piled on the third floor where they hopefully won't melt
Nokri (Marisa): i have stuff on my bed now but i can put the stuff on my bed on top of the totes and hope i don't get crushed to death in my sleep
Nokri (Marisa): i just finished a logic puzzle for the hoh contest i'm in very logic mode rn
