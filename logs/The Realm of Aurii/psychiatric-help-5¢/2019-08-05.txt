Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh yay, our internal servers are down so I can't access any of my work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): apparently it's only my computer?
Bill: I said otherwise saturday, but it's entirely possible Travis and Rebecca aren't dating. Probably shouldn't joke as such, in the case they aren't. Could hurt Rebecca.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im getting "she likes him but he doesnt like her" vibes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or he at least likes her, but like, only platonically
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i mean "like-like"
Bill: You'd know those better than me. I just saw the picture again this morning and thought it could be like that... and that'd hurt. 

But I'm also not a ray of sunshine today so you can just ignore me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): if they are dating i feel like Rebecca would be out about it?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): could also just be taking it slow for now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, just hanging out a lot and getting to know each other before making anything official
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which is like, how I would want to start dating someone
Aldus Larian (Jess): true, theyve been at it awhile tho so i feel like someone would have heard *something* by now
Aldus Larian (Jess): but, to each there own. i just hope she isnt getting hurt or anything and they are being up front with each other
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and if they do become a thing, I'll be super happy for them
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea def!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I haven't done anything work related all day...
Aldus Larian (Jess): are your servers still donw?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): computer must have just had issues connecting. I restarted and it fixed it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've just been really lazy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm fucking falling apart y'all... last week I hurt my neck and upper back, yesterday I did something to my lower back, and today I just did something to my right upper back
