I hope the sign museum has ample signage
Nokri (Marisa): The ultrasound lady was a little odd after my appointment today. It started normally but when I was leaving she was acting differently. I’m either dying or I acted so weirdly she was disturbed by my behavior while laying down and staring at the ceiling.
Aldus Larian (Jess): or maybe she just has something personal going on that started to bug her
Nokri (Marisa): Nah I’m a dying freak probably
Nokri (Marisa): At least the tufts of hair on the side of my bangs have regrown to anime length
