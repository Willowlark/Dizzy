Nokri (Marisa): How long has this ghost-looking picture been hanging up in my house
Nokri (Marisa): I was staring at the wall with Sylvia when I just noticed it and I think it’s been there for years but I’ve never really seen it before
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats terrifying
El🆓de Faun (Tom): WOAHH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ask your mom *why* for me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): With the italics
Nokri (Marisa): "hey mother, *why* do we have that picture? where did it come from?"
"how did you say those italics out loud"
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like this:
El🆓de Faun (Tom): "*Why*"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:rise:582318089228648456>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We’re putting all the coffee haters into timeout for being weenies
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also meg be like “don’t talk to me about coffee” but still has the coffee wars story highlight
Nokri (Marisa): why do boss people want me to work at 10:30pm
Nokri (Marisa): i have otakon stuff to edit and manga to read
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do ota stuff and manga
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Will got in a car accident 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He's fine, but his car might not be.
Aldus Larian (Jess): While he was doing the coffee thing?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): No, probably on the way home after doing his trading review. He said he looked down to fix something on his passenger's seat (probably the coffees) and when he looked up there was a car stopped and with the rain he wasn't able to brake fully in time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That would be really upsetting if he got hurt for the coffee thing
Nokri (Marisa): am back from work <:rise:582318089228648456>
oh noooo, a lot of people in the cosplay community seem to be getting into car accidents this week 🙀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): No one else is allowed to get in an accident this week or any other weeks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I will die for Will Hermonat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HES JUST SUCH GOOD VIBES
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m so sad for him
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Saaame
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He might not be able to go to CCE now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh. ok

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *left on read and unaccepted*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): my coworker (the annoying one) wont shut about getting drunk with his friends at the shore this weekend and all the stupid shit they're going to do
Nokri (Marisa): something died in the car ;A;
Aldus Larian (Jess): like an animal? or a part?
Nokri (Marisa): animal
yesterday bojo said when she started it there was a really loud and freaky sound and what she now realizes was probably screaming, but didn't know what it was? and it stopped after a minute. so she thought it was just the usual things falling apart, but after sitting a day when we turned the car on suddenly rancid air came out and triggered our gag reflexes eyyy
i feel so bad for whatever animal it was, we don't really have animals around here aside from ducks so i can't imagine what could've gotten under the hood
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe a chipmunck or mouse?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I found a mouse next in my air filter compartment once
Nokri (Marisa): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Nokri (Marisa): we gotta get the car to the wash but it just reeks so badly
Aldus Larian (Jess): ugh D:
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :(
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah probably a small animal
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I wonder where it was
Nokri (Marisa): i don't know much about cars at all but probably in between some gears or something? like it got absolutely shredded alive under the hood
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh god
Bill: So we were talking about shooters cause of that training session this morning at lunch. Jayeeta, whose indian, at a table with three white guys, said 'I just gotta say, whenever a white person gets arrested for these things it gets called mental illness but never anyone else.'

Which I mean, good point, BUT. Any kind of commentary on that would *absolutely* be grounds for some kind of harassment if you brought it to HR.
Nokri (Marisa): how is it harassment?
Bill: Cause it would be racial commentary.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~it's true though~~
Bill: Technically, she's racially profiling white people (which no one cares about) but I don't mind having such a discussion (white people are bullshit), but *not* in a workplace setting.
Bill: I said it's a good point lol
Bill: Just not for the workplace.
Bill: Too risky.
Nokri (Marisa): maybe it's just me. i hear that literally all the time and at rowan i did presentations on that, it seems more like a fact than racial profiling, like how there are more black people in jail than white people.
saying that white people have mental illnesses and nobody else does is more racial profiling for non-whites, because it assumes they're murderous maniacs
Bill: Oh yes, it's totally fine to talk about. The point is where the conversation is taking place.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I believe this is where the term "white privilege" comes into play
Bill: mhmmmm
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just realized the new guys name is Richard Wood
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dick Wood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's like my sister's student whose last name is Woodcock
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I said it'd suck if his first name was Richard
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): i thought you had mentioned something like that recently
