Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): here we go again with *photato dump* returns via discord 🙄
Bill: 😛
Bill: That one of Lissy is the worst of the lot I think.
Bill: Yours with the backlighting is FAR better.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEAH!
Bill: It’s the best of the lot.
Bill: He had ISSUEs in the editing I see.
Bill: The carry photo is incredibly contrasted and over sharpened if you open it.
Bill: The sitting together and even the carry have haziness issues.
Bill: Which. Okay yes, I’m pointing out flaws which isn’t nice.
Bill: But also are issues I handled as well.
Bill: But I don’t dare presume I can give hunter advice.
Bill: ~~poor Lissy~~
Bill: ~~if she wants another shoot with you you come to me~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Damn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If I poke fun at  hunters return time in this chat do I get photos next
Bill: ~~*Do you want them*~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wanna know if I look good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also hunter had some nice pose ideas that I think went well
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I’d like to see that they came out well
Bill: I’m sure you looked fine.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s always so sad when a pic I wanted to see just doesn’t make the cut
Bill: It’s the image that doesn’t.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The purple one and the one at the table are the best but the purple one looks like a random candid. Are the other images okay
Bill: Nah purple doesn't feel candid to me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Not to be a dick but, these are some of his worst photos
Bill: If you open it it's also a little fuzzy from the haze.
Bill: That lighting was not easy to work with. Look at Taiyang and Catra, they aren't *great* just passing.
Bill: It *needed* front lighting.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait not purple I meant table
Table looks candid oops
Bill: It took me two days to realize that, I doubt Hunter got that far in figuring it out.
Bill: ~~why am I defending him~~
Bill: OH yeah the table looks like it may as well be a hallshot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Looks like he blurred the wall a bit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why so fuzzy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ... he should have done photos somewhere else
Bill: mmm... but same could be said for me.
Bill: Though I wasn't being paid and I said 'we're ExPerRiMeNtInG' at the start.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ... idk dude I think a few of yours were like REALLY good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And these are ....
Aldus Larian (Jess): I like the last 2
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Well...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Not great
Bill: That uniform grain is shadow grain. He had similar issues to me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And they paid a lot of them
Aldus Larian (Jess): But very dark
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg yeah weren’t these $50? He has more pictures than what he posted right?
Bill: ~~probably not~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I hope
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But probably not
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think my own personal favorite of the bunch is Erik carrying lissy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But that ones really grainy
Bill: Okay yeah my shoots there are a lot better and I'm not even counting Georgia's.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🙀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And the lighting is off
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But like... its the most dynamic shot
N🆗ri (Marisa): This one is nice but the colors. I had to put so many layers over it just to see the cosplayer
Bill: I can't with that.
Bill: ugh. No. The contrast is SO high it's SO unflattering and creating unnatural shadows...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The pose is the best though
N🆗ri (Marisa): He shoulda touched up the faces a bit it a cute photo
Bill: It's kinda candid looking, but.
Bill: IS the only dynamic pose.
Bill: Still Lissy a pretty girl, I hope she doesn't think her Slayer Yang looks terrible and never do it again.
N🆗ri (Marisa): who lissy is she the yang
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Nah I think lissy likes the photos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Which is fine. But compared to some of hunters other photos these are def not worth the price
N🆗ri (Marisa): That one of her is 100% desaturated except for the yellow rip all other colors in existence
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like sometimes he gives back really good photos. Other times... not so much
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's like a lottery
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did y’all have to pay to get into the restaurant for the table photo
Bill: I'm not trying to be sarcastic, I'm taking an interest.
Bill: I know I like that.
Bill: And I'm the only one whose going to be able to tell what he did.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Well we only wanted to go to him with stuff we knew he liked cause we wanted to get the most of the shoot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But that meant we all brought him bees and that’s it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He ran out of ideas pretty quick
Bill: ~~I can out shoot him in bees~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): True lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And that’s prob also why he returned the non bees ones first took
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He only has so much bee idea
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So his ability to only really put effort into what he knows best combined with his price kinda shot him in the foot
Bill: I shouldn't even cross that out, I absolutely can out bee him. I shoot *Tom and Jess* best couple ever.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t think I’ll really be booking hunter much for the future
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): For a lot of factors but it was a lot less fun to shoot too 😦
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I dIDNT do the THOT SMILE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that’s how you know
Bill: Yeah you only do that with me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The wat
Bill: The smile she doing here. I may have dubbed it the thot smile at some point last weekend. 😅
Bill: She’s been doing it since... Next’18 at least, in most of her test shots.
Bill: So I see it a hell of a lot.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tho it’s not even a smile and is only mildly thot-ish
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It has been dubbed, thot smile
Bill: *just mildly*
Bill: ~~totally a smile, you just need to force it awkwardly~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he.... he's gonna upload more.... right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo lissy is someone in bne? did i ever meet her? <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
do you want me to try and ask if he'll post more. like, "woah!! that's cool! are there more shots from these shoots?" or somethin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *I'm trying to find where he stated how many photos he'd return because 5 photos is not worth $45 for someone of his skill level*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s on that google form probably
N🆗ri (Marisa): how long was the shoot? it looks like you went to several different places
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It was supposed to be basically an hourish long
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like we rushed through a lot of it though
N🆗ri (Marisa): con photography standard is one hour = ~8 pictures
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): mainly focusing on getting to duo shots and solos of her because I also had my shoot with Georgia next
Bill: Don’t forget the 15 minutes blown in showing you pictures from earlier shoots.
N🆗ri (Marisa): usually every 20-30 minutes is 2-5 pictures. like i paid $40 for 6 pictures in 20 minutes and it was super rushed but that's standard and we had arranged the location and mood ahead of time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Me and Eriks was kinda meh too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo so erik and the yang had a shoot and then erik and georgia? so if hunter has more pics then after that should be you right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *waiting for those additional 2-5 photos*
Bill: Depends on the edits but. Those standards about right.
Bill: You probably have to say something to that effect...
Bill: If you really care about it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Can’t wait for the last of em!”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll wait it out for a little
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at least until after he posts the ones with Georgia
Bill: Or talk to him about it in a dm. If he says he has no more you can accept that, advising him clients aren’t going to be happy about that... or maybe he’ll give you some amount back or offer another shoot ~~not that you need that~~.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like I did way more with Georgia than I did with Lissy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and yet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I did the $45 tier with Lissy and the $30 with Goergia
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And we spent most of the shoot tryna find a location oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I liked that park I was lowkey tryna budget hunter to go there, it was cold but it will probably yield the best photos
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): with you we did the hall, the garage, and trekked to the courtyard
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): with Lissy it was the hall and then really quick in the lobby restaurant
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like hunter wasn’t prepared
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he was not
Bill: He’s trying to be a pro without acting like it. I’ve said that before.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which won’t do if he’s tryna go pro
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yuuuup
Bill: God I wanted to go outside.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i usually rack up 3000+ pictures per zenkai and this year i only got 150 <:rip:369476083248267274>
95% of those are georg and jes, but sorry they're bad, and then 4% are the moon
N🆗ri (Marisa): it doesn't show up red like it did at the con ;u;
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: White balance.
Bill: You were staffing!
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah but even while staffing i'd get a few thousand pictures. this year just really sucked
N🆗ri (Marisa): through the power of photoshop i make red. totally realistic copyright 2019 donut steel
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do i white balance the moon
Bill: Camera does it automatically.
N🆗ri (Marisa): im gonna need more curtains
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Big oof y'all
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I forgot to tell my boss that I plan on ducking out for a few hours tomorrow for my high school's career day... whoops
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoops
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he thought it was really cool that I was doing it last year so I don't think it'll be a problem. I put my availability for after main production left so it's not like anyone's really going to need me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): went to start working on a customer quote only to find that none of the BOMs list the manufacturer part numbers again 🙃
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and my Spotify wasn't working for a while but now it's back
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea mine wast either
N🆗ri (Marisa): Reddit was down last night for a while it was tragic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ok I really just do not understand snow
N🆗ri (Marisa): like water but colder
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She says she’s irl summer rose but I don’t get how you can identify with a character who hasn’t even spoken
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): What happened now LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh yea shes like skinning a character with no discernable personality
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But also she posted that she unironically worships the Greek gods and that’s the first I’ve heard of someone doing that
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe she's dead inside
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): KINNING
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): NOT SKINNING
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _skinning_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OHHHH NOOO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Zahshhshsh
Aldus Larian (Jess): hoooo boi
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Summer Rose skin suit <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YIKES
Aldus Larian (Jess): ERIK XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's ruby
Aldus Larian (Jess): i almost chocked on coffee
Bill: claim your "I'm this character irl" now.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also isn't she usually like, struggling financially? How is she in Greece
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg really
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I also dont understand why that's a thing... like people tell me " oh wow you're just yang irl" and I'm like ???? No???? I'm leanna
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~same goes for Hal traveling to England~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Snows family is wealthy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~Hal’s family probably paid~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *You're Leyannga*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And her mom works for an airline so they get free airfare
Bill: They’re young enough that’s still a thing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): [then perish meme]
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:5142_then_perish:554720548274569246>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaa people who same "Im irl (character name)" i do not understand
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah! And especially for a character we’ve had all of 2 seconds to see!
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea seriosuly....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think it’s cause summer rose isn’t legitimately hated so if snow feels she aligns with her then she’ll be more likeable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just a guess tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Its ... weird
N🆗ri (Marisa): how old is she because this sounds like something a fresh teenager would do
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like all we know about summer is that she had silver eyes and was a mom
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and baked cookies
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh yea and that lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Very important personality trait
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and Snow gets baked... so... I guess that's a correlation....
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG ERIK XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): snow int even a mom
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think at least
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean i dont know much about her maybe she got a baby somewhere
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~for the theoretical baby’s sake I hope not~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I legitimately can not understand how snow thinks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t always agree with others but I can usually understand where they’re coming from
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah I saw the Greek gods thing and I was like "weird flex, but okay..." but then I always have to remember everyone's entitled to their beliefs and you shouldn't shit on them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Snow? No idea, no clue
Bill: That's not news.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah she’s entitled to her beliefs but it’s just odd to see it’s such a minority as far as popularity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s like someone saying they’re in a very specific cult
Bill: It's why I was never like Snow... I couldn't get a read on how she is.
Bill: Liar? Victim? Brown noser?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....shes....manipulative
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and attention seeking by any means necessary
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea shes got them big compulsive liar vibes
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone who hurts you but then turns it around on you
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats just an impression i keep her arms length ~~or further~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, like not saying this just to be mean to her or whatever but she definitely has some personality disorder
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Bill: it unlikely she'll try and befriend you Jess. You and Tom are very much tied to me, and I unfollowed her at one point. She noticed, cause she unfollowed me and refollowed when she posted an image I did.
Bill: So my unfollowing must have pissed her off. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): she always seems really excited to see me and tells me she loves me so idk
Bill: it's fake.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah she would say that to me too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ^^^
Bill: Pleasantries.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i know
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And she goes through phases of being obsessed with people
Aldus Larian (Jess): but im saying she doesnt hate me just cuz u unfollowed her
Aldus Larian (Jess): has she ever been diagnosed with anything?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she follows and unfollows me on the daily
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so like thats not really anything
Bill: Oh, Snow will never outwardly hate you.
Bill: It'll always be behind closed doors.
Aldus Larian (Jess): or at least have a therapist?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she told me she has BPD, but like.. so do I... i guess it's the fact that she doesnt even try to fix herself and I do
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she used it as a crutch to use against me during th drama
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): as well as her disabilities
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >.>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i was going to say she seems to give off the impression of BPD
N🆗ri (Marisa): her disabilities can explain behavior but it don't excuse anything
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea
Bill: ^
Bill: @ everyone at conventions ever
Aldus Larian (Jess): she needs therapy
Bill: Outwardly hating someone gives them ammunition against you. The nice and sweet girl is *never* mean, and anyone who says she is is *obviously* the bully. Hating only forms a bond with a common enemy, if you want to manipulate people you always want to be the nice friend who couldn't hurt a fly.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeet
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's just weak you gotta volunteer to murder someone on occasion
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I always just try to be nice and keep the status quo because potential suicide risk :/
Bill: ~~is it weird I like the techniques and 'study' of manipulation and appearances?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): did someone threaten suicide when you talked to them??
Aldus Larian (Jess): snow has had multiple suicide scares
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no, she's had several suicide scares
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru you'd like murderer documentaries
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean not really its pretty common to be interested in that kind of stuff
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s fascinating to see what people do yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): its all psychology and its highly interesting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Game of thrones is all manipulation and look how popular that is lol
Bill: Eh. Murder isn't really something I'd associate with. It's the smaller stuff, petty high school level I find so amusing.
Bill: I hate that about game of thrones though XD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What part do you like then, the diddlies <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But yeah it’s interesting seeing how very different personalities interact
Bill: I.
Bill: Don't like game of thrones.
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw see murderers usually have that stuff down pat. john wayne gacy, rodney alcalca, jeffrey dahmer, ted bundy. all highly respected in their community.
one of dahmer's victims even escaped his house and ran away naked, and the cops gave him back to dahmer because he played it off like a lover's quarrel and then killed the guy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): imagine running away from a killer, begging a cop for help, and the cop just sends you right back to the killer and you die. that sucks.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~whens the next season of criminal minds~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): wasn't season 15 the last one?
Aldus Larian (Jess): o idk i watch on nextlfix
Bill: Again I... don't associate with that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it's done forever sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): you dont need to associate with something to find it interesting
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i hate criminal shows yet that's the only channel our TV is ever on~~ if you need info about serial killers hmu, bojo's always been obsessed with them and i know everything
Aldus Larian (Jess): i havnt seen season 15 so i still get more whoo
N🆗ri (Marisa): in the final episode the criminal mind kills you
Bill: Gen said she doesn't have the credit limit for booking Katsu rooms... It's one night deposit, so that's only (only ha) 250~325 bucks depending on Atrium room or not...
Bill: Is. There a point to a credit card that low?
Bill: My first credit card was 500 bucks.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mine was 300
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe she uses it to pay bills
Aldus Larian (Jess): she might be almost maxed out tho
Bill: Yeah true.
Bill: To both.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I use mine to pay bills
Bill: If she uses it day to day, the Katsu charge would eat up her limit.
Bill: Same.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Gotta get Dem points
Bill: YE boi.
Bill: It makes sense though I guess.
Bill: I was imagining some kind of 100 dollar credit limit and I couldn't see the point in it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): free $100
Bill: *You have to pay it back*
Bill: Well.
Bill: Steal my cat and call my Jumin.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how does the card take the money back
N🆗ri (Marisa): if it has no hands
N🆗ri (Marisa): the dollar is bigger than the card
N🆗ri (Marisa): it can't eat all that at once
Bill: Always try to use credit in place of money you have, not money you don't have. It's far safer
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bold of you to assume we have $100 combined
Aldus Larian (Jess): its safer but not everyone can use it that way
Bill: I did say try.
Bill: I know it's not always possible.
Bill: I corrected the way my parents always told me the same thing because I understand that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bold of you to assume people exist
N🆗ri (Marisa): I wonder what makes people cross the line from “I identify a lot with this character and see myself in them” to “I am the literal embodiment of this character”
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s a recent thing that only noticeably began in the last 5 or so years I think
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea its the hot new thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): Buff misty cosplayer followed me immediately after I followed them I am truly #blessed <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hunter has messaged me bout zenkai
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh since rebecca couldnt make it to the one shoot, hunter is gonna send me what he managed to get but hes refunding the cost
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i guess he didnt get enough of me and mag
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's very nice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at least he's refunding you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but still, I'd be kind of disappointed
N🆗ri (Marisa): how long was the shoot? if he only needs 4~5 pictures there should be something to work with
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he said solos came out well but no pairing things
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he said those kinds of returns would personally disappoint him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so thats why
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah im a little disappointed but with rebecca sick, we only snagged a few of me and mag
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and honestly it was kinda hard to shoot with mag cause i dont know her enough
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i didnt know what she was ok and not ok with
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): valid
Bill: heeee should have filled in the gaps with that, "knowing" you both.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): maybe he felt he didnt know us well enough either
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its easier to shoot with people i know better cries
N🆗ri (Marisa): what were you cosplaying?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like shooting with justin is easy as hell
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): beeeees
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://media1.tenor.com/images/723268d8dfa4fb25a7600044164e28b1/tenor.gif?itemid=4653907
Bill: That’s more your comfort level than his I’d say. 😛
Bill: The Rebecca shoot you just kinda told him what to do and he did. He was really out of it though.
Bill: I dunno tho I get the feel Hunter considers Anna/Mag and you regulars?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): justins not good with coming up with pose ideas cause he hasnt had enough shoots tbh but hes comfy with most poses
Bill: At the very least friends so he could have filled in the gaps.
Bill: Posing with you is quite easy.
Bill: Even I find it easier.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): posing in the photo with or posing via camera
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean both are probably pretty easy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont even know how many shoots ive done in total now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HUNTER HAS SENT THE PHOTOS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeaaaah i think that hallway was a bad spot for him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525901685864923136/565941011537461278/IMG_4490.jpg
N🆗ri (Marisa): he didn't post them in discord? :0
oo he did
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525901685864923136/565941039114879001/IMG_4501.jpg

N🆗ri (Marisa): are u ok ur fallin out of the window in that first one
N🆗ri (Marisa): second one is nice it's like you're breaking in the window to save someone from a burning building
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525901685864923136/565941548131418112/IMG_4503.jpg
Bill: Light is better in that last one but the composition looks candid.
Bill: Third one.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like the setup of the fourth one but also looks kind of candid and would've worked better in another location. the contrast of the wall is nice and matches your outfits but makes it look like two pictures photoshopped together
Bill: Posing you is easy for me, but that’s just knowing what makes you look beautiful. You kinda fill in the gaps and we make magic. I meant posing with you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525901685864923136/565941019548581908/IMG_4498.jpg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this angle makin me look skinny ye boi
Bill: It’s only been the one time I think but you have an air of confidence that’s helpful.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that best one so far
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats a good one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow you got more photos back than I did 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): gotta put on my resume "air of confidence"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and it was also a 30 minute slot_
Bill: He did a better job on your stuff than Erik and Lissy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and theres like 3 more
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): erik we love you but you got gypped
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's not fair to erik yeah
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): and you got refunded
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): will not be doing shoots with Hunter again unless I'm not paying
N🆗ri (Marisa): come shoot with me i suck but am free for friends <:rise:557579163511554050>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes plz
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you take good photos
Bill: Shoot with Marisa YE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): your photos are great
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): sniping people from across the Gaylord
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): much skill
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MARISA VERY FUN TOO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): shes gives words of encouragement
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and many good photos back
N🆗ri (Marisa): im still laughing over shooting you on the balcony and then going in the room like "is georgia ok i have this picture of her and she looks sad"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg what xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was amazing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): omg yes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _sniped_
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was on the gazebo level or something and i saw them on the balcony and was taking pictures from across the atrium :3c
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498334550645145600/564302649672073236/unknown.png
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *the balcony of their hotel room, mind you*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): same energy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah she suddenly busts into the room and goes "IS GEORGIA OKAY?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): that looks like the cover of some romance mystery young adult novel
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that is my life yes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oop he do the dump thing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh the punch one is cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): o the punch one yeah das neat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YE
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ONE PUNCH woMAN
Aldus Larian (Jess): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): REALLY i wasnt a huge fan of that one
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can feel the brutality of it on the other side of the screen
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea ngl i like that one the most
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and the straight on one second best
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, looking back at mine, the one of us at the table, Lissy is VERY out of focus
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): arms crossed one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): makes me feel like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/b/b0/Big_Fist.png/revision/latest?cb=20180505144809
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye arms crossed is my fav
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk, why did hunter poo the bed when it came to your shoot?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yaoi hand
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh she blurry
Bill: He did do better with you.
Bill: Upstairs he blew out the window for front lighting, a normal thing... the bench one is boring...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/e/e4/Jumin_Sticker_02.gif
Bill: Omg
Bill: Amazing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *maybe I'll just "forget" to tag him when I post them*
Bill: Don’t.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *oops*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ERIK? STARTING TEA?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _WHAT YEAR IS IT_
N🆗ri (Marisa): you could be passive aggressive like "here's the *best* image i got"
Bill: Ah. I think he shot Georgia’s hallway shots further in than yours. The ones I shot in all had windows facing them; that gave better front lighting. Time of day also applies, Georgia was morning and you guys were afternoon.
Bill: That’s why Georgia’s hallway shots are cleaner.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or i mean you could just be like "hey i was expecting to get a few more than what you returned, do you think you could return a couple more, or maybe give me a partial refund since i only got back 4(?)"
N🆗ri (Marisa): was there a panel going on? that hallway was filled with a lot of lines at certain times of the day
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they were waiting for the one event at Tellus
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and PubForge
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So total I got 5 photos and 4 meme photos out of my shoot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *for free*
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait he only returned 4 for you erik? even tho he charged full?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): unless some of them were lissy singles
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I paid for the $45 tier which is supposed to be 7-10 photos. He returned 5 but one was a Lissy solo
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): you paid it? did lissy pay anything?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I told her I'd cover it
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: 💜
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: But you know, oof.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Obligatory Jumin daddy comment
Bill: The most generous thing you can do is tell Hunter that you're disappointed that you didn't get the full returns you thought you were going to get.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah I'll probably ask
Bill: Let him either apologize and make amends himself, or excuse himself, or whatever the case may be.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think he was also struggling with coming up with pose ideas because he literally had three bee shoots and probably didn't want to do the same things for each
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not saying that justifies insufficient returns, but it was an observation
Bill: Just because he has three shoots, doesn't mean he needs three different sets of poses though. If you have the same pose as Mag or Georgia has the same pose as Lissy, they have different (theoretically) followers and aren't going to be confused.
Bill: He won't be able to use the same pose in *his* portfolio, but you are paying for the shoot so if there's an AWESOME photo idea, he should reuse it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): with different groups of people tho they could've all been very different. can't just consider the character you gotta consider the cosplayer too and how they'd lend different strengths to different poses
Bill: YuP.
Bill: There are poses that Jess does great that Georgia can't do.
N🆗ri (Marisa): handstands
Bill: Obviously I have a leg up in that scenario because of familiarity, but as a paid pro you need to make judgements based on someone's build to know how to flatter them. Which is an experience skill.
N🆗ri (Marisa): one woman i worked with at katsu a few years back would tell me to do a pose, and then be like "suck in your gut more your fat is showing" and i was like *i am sucking in my gut what else am i supposed to do*
different pose woulda worked better
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill fucking fight her
Bill: yeaaaaah you dooooonttttt say that.
Bill: holy shit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank u photog lady i am sure am having fun
also my wig cap was showing in every picture <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg THAT is something i wish people were more comfortable telling others to fix
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the amount of photos i hate of penny from katsu because my wig fell back
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): PLEASE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): TELL. ME.
Bill: I just don't notice sometimes.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i put in wig clips now so it wont ever happen again
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but the hall shots i saw of myself i was just like omg....im embarassed
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i don't notice it during the shoot i edit it in photoshop
N🆗ri (Marisa): at natsuket my makeup was running because it was sweltering hot and i was using dollar store makeup. people were taking my picture but not being direct telling me to fix my makeup. they kept saying "do you want to take a break? you can take a break you know. are you sure you don't want a break?" and i was like "??no i'm good?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): if its something someone can fix immediately tell them
Aldus Larian (Jess): its its something they cant fix (like their weight)  dont
Bill: Ye, good policy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like ok, EXAMPLE because im so mad about it:
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): please someone should have told me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i look like pinhead
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fucking help
N🆗ri (Marisa): hehehehehehe that is a little funny
maybe they didn't notice and thought your wig was supposed to be like that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I MeAN MAYBE but like FAM
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): anyone here
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if you ever see me with a wig like this
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): please
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i wont be mad
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): just tell me xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): mood
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is one of the fat pics
gurl if I suck in my gut anymore I’m going to collapse in on myself like that black hole
Aldus Larian (Jess): wtf is she talking about
Bill: that's a shitty photo too damn.
Bill: Bring back Nowi.
Bill: I'll shoot it 100x better.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd like to fix the cape now that i have stuff to make it stand up better/properly, and actually surge the tights, but i still have everything and know where it should be
Bill: Back to photos for a hot sec, I low key wanna book Zeikani, Rebecca, Mawisa, ~~not Hunter~~, David, and Lissy for something like Big 3 and just. Compare.
N🆗ri (Marisa): lets do it
Bill: I don’t have a mirio wig right now lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): u wot
N🆗ri (Marisa): *u wot m8*
Bill: Leanna... low key... demanded... I do not style wig and let her do it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I ordered an arda wig to style for you but it's on backorder
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So bear with me lmao
Bill: I ain’t rushing you.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 🐻
Bill: Getting David and Lissy around at a con is hard too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): O ok that’s fine I got worried that you were just wigless forever
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Also <@245270932602486784> hunter is asking if hes invited to Casey and ethans "party"
Bill: But like. Ultimate shoot out.
Bill: I could theoretically do the shooting side too but like. ~~I already know I’m da best?~~ 😎
Bill: Holy fuck. I keep typing things and wanting to put an MM emoji after them.
Bill: I need to commission a set.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We gotta make RFA emoji
Aldus Larian (Jess): couldnt you just like make them into dicord emojis?
Bill: I mean like. I want a set of me. Drawn.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OHHH ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): Too many people in the server and not enough emoji slots for everyone owo
Bill: ^
Bill: But those look better bigger so I’d put them as dizzy commands.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Could dizzy do YEAH
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/55sx3FG.png
Bill: Dizzy, tsun
Bill: Like that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): so lorge tho
Bill: If the raw image is sized correctly it’ll be fine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): if the photography thing is done, would it be possible to have an anonymous vote? like, all images are uploaded in random order, mixed in with one another and everyone is polled for their favorites and why? it'd be neat to see what's popular and sticks out
N🆗ri (Marisa): and worst photos vote i wanna aim for the bottom
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Should I let hunter come?
Bill: Only if it’s not for competition purposes Marisa. The point would not be to make one person feel inferior to the others.
Bill: Should look into the way actual photography contests are run.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no not for competition, to see what people like and dislike about photos. like how georgia said she didn't like the punch one but the rest of us did
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also Bill, yeah I kind of want chibi emojis of myself too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I see people with chibi profile pics and I'm like *ooh I kind of want one of those...*
N🆗ri (Marisa): surprised no one's made a custom rfa emoji maker
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh there's bitmoji and stuff but those are a little freaky
Bill: Yeah!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 👀

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hestia, aphrodite, areas
N🆗ri (Marisa): she wants to be a hot angry housewife?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Probably

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just got a FB friend request from a friend of ChocoWaffo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Brittanie is the only mutual friend
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:hmm:543194383885926403>

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m just gonna use a rule of thumb to not trust anyone who refers to themselves as “irl [character]”
