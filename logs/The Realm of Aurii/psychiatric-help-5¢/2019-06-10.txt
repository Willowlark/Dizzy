Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *I hope they confiscate them for not having an orange tip*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LMAO
Nüëåkri (Marisa): u no he‚Äôs under arrest
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ERIK "nope, I'm good thanks"
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Hdjdjdjjdjdhxhxh
Nüëåkri (Marisa): Peer pressure assemblies have raised him well
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was debating painting them, but I'd rather not risk it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg i hate this latin america clas
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she decided to add a forum post to yesterday, a SATURDAY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i missed it because she doesnt send out email blasts, she just expects us to check the website every day omg
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Yooo that's dumbbb
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wooooooo our person that takes care of order entry and customer service is on vacation this week so guess who gets to take over her job as well <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: So you‚Äôre doing... 3? 4 people‚Äôs work now?
Bill: Humidity must be high... or I‚Äôm getting sick cause I feel all clammy.
Bill: Yuck.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then she's taking another week the week before I do so that'll be a fun week leading up to my vacation lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so our one customer that sends us a fuck ton of assemblies to make small batch orders obviously copy and pastes a lot of things in their drawings which leads to mistakes that I have to catch. I've had to send like 5 different emails to their engineer to clarify because the wire charts make no sense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's stuff that with common sense you can assume what it's *supposed* to be, but you're really not supposed to assume things
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): BUT if you make them per the drawing, it'll spark a whole series of issues in the future with returns and reworks which is a big fat waste of time and money
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The apartment I want still hasn't been listed. He said second week of June. Maybe I'll email him later and ask
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But there's also a 2bed/2bath for $170/month more........
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which comes out to an extra $2040 for a year's lease.... which isn't that bad...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): could have a cosplay room...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly, the price per square foot is cheaper...
Bill: Oof. My stomach hate me today.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üò¶
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): any thoughts on whether or not I should go for the 2 bedroom? I texted my dad about it thinking he'd give some input and he just replied with "sounds good" lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the rent would be $1,315 but that includes all the utilities minus electric
Aldus Larian (Jess): id email the ugy for the first one but also det up a time to see the second one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they're all pretty much set up the same way so I'm not expecting anything different other than an extra room and bathroom
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooh ok i didnt realize it was that same complex. the extra space in the 2 bedroom will be nice id say if you can swing is comfortably than go for the 2 bedroom
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my thinking is an extra room for cosplay and music stuff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.apartments.com/country-club-reading-pa/6xxt2fv/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you can see the 3D layout of the 2 bedroom
Aldus Larian (Jess): it has 2 bathroom? :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 250 more sq ft for $170 more a month
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i think you could use the extra room for sure!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): put it up as a poll on my insta so I can ignore everyone's input and go with what I want lololol
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Flip a coin and ignore the result üëå üëå üëå üëå
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): fuck how do I let Dizzy choose
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think its
Dizzy: You should choose 1 beroom
Aldus Larian (Jess): !choose 1 beroom, 2 bedroom
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my sister is saying the same thing lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, I *could* do either
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's an extra $2,040 a year which is doable, but might still be worth it to just stick with the 1 bed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): couuld put that $2,040 towards cons
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or food
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or emergency money
Kaio Vermino (Lee): If it's just you living there with no plans to get a roommate I would say go for the 1 bedroom
Kaio Vermino (Lee): The extra space is nice
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But
Kaio Vermino (Lee): In the long run it's just extra space for clutter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): true
Aldus Larian (Jess): good point
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~lord knows thats what i do with mine~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Saving money is always good especially in case of emergency/vacation(con) funds.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): could also put that money towards furniture
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But I think growing up in a place where we co instantly had extra space made me realize how unnecessary it is unless you truly need it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which I'd need
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Furniture yes
Bill: The option for having a roommate is something though.
Bill: I know I was thinking I wanted two bedroom (and probably have to give up on that cause jersey rent)  for an office but I work from home.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): we have some stuff in our storage locker that my parents said I could have which includes a coffee table and two end tables as well as a liquor cabinet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bold of you to assume anyone lives near me to room with...
also would prefer being alone anyway
Bill: Def would say the second bathroom is going to be a pain tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): second bathroom will prob be a waste, we have one and we never use it
Nüëåkri (Marisa): a friend in japan lives in a two-bedroom apartment by herself and the space is really nice
cosplay bathroom and regular bathroom
Bill: Ditto, ditto, but option is there if you change your mind or want to split rent.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its just and extra thing to clean
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wouldn't have to clean it as much if no one uses it <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WOW
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): BRANDON
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): BRANDON MONEYBAGS SELL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): said I should $ave dat money
Bill: ~~he watches stories?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah shockingly
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Wow damn
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): He hath spoken
Bill: My stomach has not settled with food... >.<
Nüëåkri (Marisa): BANG DREAM IS ALL WEIRD AND DIFFERENT WHAT HAPEPNED HERE
Bill: I might take an early train home. That seems smart.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): feel better Bill ‚ù§
Bill: Ye we out.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): The good good üôè
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Don't forget to buy crypt of the Necro dancer and play it for 5 minutes once you get home
Bill: I wasn‚Äôt doing anything anyway.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): It's 3 bucks üôè
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Gotta practice for cadence of Hyrule
Bill: Isn‚Äôt it on switch?
Bill: Pray I make it to Hoboken for the 2:27 train.
Nüëåkri (Marisa): run
Bill: Fuck. I will have one minute to get from path exit to train.
Bill: Fucking path schedule.
Bill: And if I miss it the train after that is at 4.
Bill: üò≠
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof üò∞
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I hope you make it!
Bill: I did!
Bill: I sprint.
Bill: I don‚Äôt eva sprint.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Wooo!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: I‚Äôm falling sleep. Or rather have been asleep.
Bill: I try to avoid that on train cause what if someone takes my stuff while I‚Äôm out or I miss you station but.
Bill: What a wave of exhaustion.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Yeahhhh
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Oof
Bill: Dover. Not too much further.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Almost time for some Necro dancing
Bill: Ye I wanna lay in bed and be dead thanks.
Bill: Oof.
Bill: ‚ÄúA wish and a goal, while similar, are still different. A wish is something for another to grant; a goal is something you reach for with your own hands.

To turn a wish into a goal is one of the greatest achievements in life. To go the other way is soul-crushing.‚Äù
Bill: Oh that‚Äôs deep and sad.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lol a couple minutes after david posted about cosplaying with me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hal messaged david
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and was like "WE should cosplay together"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and david straight up told him no lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): good lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): david was like "i know he only wants to ask, cause he wants to use me, to make you jealous, and i dont wanna cosplay with him OR be used"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): smart boy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ew just ran a mile for the first time in forever
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That time puts me at ‚Äúaverage athletic ability‚Äù almost in ‚Äúathletic‚Äù
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 0-6 minutes is very athletic, 6-10 is athletic, 11-15 is average, leaning towards becoming out of shape, 15+ is very out of shape
Nüëåkri (Marisa): file me under horrifically out of shape
Nokri (Fopdoodle): shoutout to that guy yesterday who was showing me pictures of his ex while i was trying to get somewhere in a hurry and saying "my ex was a perfect 10 but you know, i'd settle for someone who's like a four with a great personality. do you believe in love?" and who walked away when i said no <:pew:543202259085950996>
