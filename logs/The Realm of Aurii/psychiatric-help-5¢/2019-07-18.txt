Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Once again, I gave to ask our customer to provide the manufacturer part numbers for the components on their assemblies. Usually when I have to do this, they'll ask for which parts I need and I'll send them a list of their internal part numbers, but there's like 10 assemblies and I don't have time for that bullshit so ig they ask I'm going to be *very* passive aggressive and just attach their own BOMs and say "Please see attached"
