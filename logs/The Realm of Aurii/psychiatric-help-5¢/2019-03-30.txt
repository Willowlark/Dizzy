Bill: Boi I hope Mark is not only watching goblin slayer, but watching it with his family cause that’s the weirdest image ever.
Bill: I stood up to get a tissue in the orthopedics office...
Bill: That’s an old fucking picture.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just spent at least 10 minutes trying to remember what orthopedic is
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I still haven’t REMEMEBRED
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s grease lighting
Bill: Foot doctor.
Bill: I low key wish I could say I look totally different.
Bill: It’s just the hair style and not that god awful tech hoodie.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is that the picture they have for you
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wat
Bill: I've been going since I was a kid. I didn't even know they had a picture.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Guess who needs a ride to Ethan and Casey's party 🙃
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh boy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh no
Bill: what happen?
Bill: OOOOH wait I thought your CAR broke it's Rebecca isn't it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She just texted me 😑
Aldus Larian (Jess): Big yikes
Aldus Larian (Jess): When is that again?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We're planning on a sleepover too right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yee friday into saturday
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe she won't be able to because work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll have to see
Bill: Could always say you have a thing after so you can't drive her this time.
N🆗ri (Marisa): "if you drive with me you get stuck with ethan for many more hours. how desperate are you?"
Bill: ~~why does she even want to go anyway it's Ethan~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i want to go to watch the tea storm~~
Bill: *You'll hear all about it*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): When you see a dude post a photo and their collection of cosplayer prints is showing in the background and you recognize one as someone who was probably underage in the photo (not lewd though) and then you check and the dude is 29... <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I guess not technically illegal since they're not lewd but still kinda creepy...
Bill: It’s... kinda weird to have cosplayer prints at all imo.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): TRUTH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yeaaaaa that's why I didnt spend any time or energy to make prints or sell then at geekdom
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I feel weird about randoms having my photos in physical form
Bill: Like... obviously I’ve put photos up of me and friends in cosplay, but I’ve never put a cosplay print up there, even in a “this is how good I can be with photography” way. The only time I could ever seen hanging a print was if I had a studio space specifically.
Bill: *print of friend even
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same which is why I didn't want to be involved in Hunter's print sale
Bill: Hmm. I was going to snark that anyone can print what you post but. Instagram ruins print quality due to it ruining photos.
Bill: So you’re fairly safe from that, in reality.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, if they print a shitty quality photo, as long as they don't tell me I really don't care
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, if they pay real human dollars for a picture of me to hang up, then I find that weird
Bill: It’s... definitely odd.
Bill: I don’t know anyone who does get them, thinking about it.
Bill: So I can’t even say there’s X person whose normal who does it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I agreed to hunters print rh ing because I knew no one would buy mine LOL
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So I'm supporting him without actually having consequences
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Not to be a dick but
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I know I'm not popular enough to sell prints
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The only ones hes gonna have luck with are prob Georgia and Casey sandera
Bill: Mhmm. Mostly Casey I’d guess.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Casey is his saving grace with that I think
Bill: Well. We were speculating that he wasn’t getting the sales he wanted based on how pushy he got for shoots pre Zenkai.
Bill: So may not so much grace.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And face it, if people want to buy prints of Casey, they're probably going to do it straight through her
Bill: If he wants money for shoots, he needs to advertise to the Facebook groups damnit. Riding Casey’s coattails isn’t going to get him far. I forget when we were talking about it but she isn’t really that famous. I’m starting to see that.
Bill: (Good for her, fame is a pain in the ass)
N🆗ri (Marisa): if y'all didn't talk about her i'd have no idea who she is
Bill: And Jake is doing photos now so Hunter won’t get paid for shoots with Casey, So material for sales is going to run out....
Bill: Ugh the boi is trying to be a pro because he knows people and all it really takes to be a pro is a photoshop ad on the Facebook groups.
Bill: Waiting for people to request shoots from you is a huge mistake.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm curious how many prints he's sold because i'm sure some people bought them to support the cause but i doubt it's very many
 ~~not that he would probably say if anyone asked <:hmmph:543192410402848769> ~~
Bill: Hell, I got caught up on that for a good while with *friends* and it wasn’t healthy.
Bill: With strangers and friends of friends?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He does even charge casey
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Bill: He’ll never get the affirmation he wants.
Bill: Does he?
Bill: I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm honestly trying to think of a redeeming quality about him but i'm sorry it's evolved to hatred <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: Though, he could easily be on a kick “I can’t shoot for exposure anymore I’m too good” and start charging her.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh woops I meant he does not
Bill: His methods are like, all wrong imo and I should really *tell him* that because *its not like I care if he hates me for it* and I’m saying it to help him reach his goals.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo very different statements
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Too many drinks sorry
N🆗ri (Marisa): water yes
Bill: 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yeaaa water <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I need me some medicinal booze probably yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): can anyone honestly tell me anything good about him to change my hatred
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't like hating people
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:huh:555585958146473984>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Uh
Bill: OOF
Bill: Figured you guys would be the best bet for a positive thing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He likes good RWBY characters <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): so he's just a druggie photographer who uses people and ignores everyone else and is somehow popular
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He..... doesnt talk any shit about anyone and genuinely enjoys people as a whole..?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah!!
i feel bad about speaking bad about him now. oh no. really bad. i'm sorry.
but he doesn't talk bad about people he just ignores them <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: When it’s not related to cons he’s just a hyper active guy yeah.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea I mean... hes just a LOT of a person idk what else to say that's positive really lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hes fun to hang out with sometimes
Bill: I wouldn’t describe him as someone who uses people either... He’s going that way, but it’s not... intentional?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm gonna bury myself in a pit omg i said such harsh stuff
Bill: I don’t think he realizes it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i don't think anything he does is intentional which is the sad part
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea he doesnt mean to use people
Aldus Larian (Jess): We won my a pizza plushy at CCE cuz I couldn't get it with the claw machine!
Bill: Oh yeah he did!
Bill: He’s a terrible person though for ignoring Marisa. So I guess he can’t live up past that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the handful of interactions i've had with him have all been negative but everyone seems to really like him so i want to give him a chance. but he's really blown every chance so far and he probably thinks of me like a disgusting cockroach.
Bill: But before you write him off completely, wait till there’s a party at Georgia’s you’re both at Mawisa. In a non con setting you may get a chance to talk to him for real.
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk, if he didn't talk to me when i was standing *right next to him for several minutes* i doubt he'd talk to me at all
Bill: ~~you keep saying everyone really likes him, I don’t, Erik and Leanna couldn’t come up with anything positive to say, no one else chimed in like who~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): everyone's interactions with him, people always asking him what he's up to and what con's he's attending, he's kiwi's favorite as he messaged me about for like 10 minutes.
that's pretty much our only interaction, him messaging me about how much kiwi loves him and that fight he was pickin' in BNE when i was asking about anext stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): am i jealous? yeah probably <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Again, everyone is...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jealous of him?
N🆗ri (Marisa): people talk of him often and that comes off as popularity in my mind
Bill: He’s the type to pick fights. It’s one of the reasons I’m loathe to ever tell him my opinions, cause he’ll argue to prove he’s right ~~and as an alpha Leo I have to be right~~. You need a higher “social navigation” stat to deal with his type. (Ethan one of them ftr)
Bill: We talk about you all day silly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:woah:543194447345876998> i'm sorry what did i do
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it what i said about him because i really do feel awful about it
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can repent
Bill: You touched our lives in ways we’ll never forget.
Aldus Larian (Jess): No I mean biru, you think everyone is jealous of him?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh ew
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/pBTIX3l.gif
N🆗ri (Marisa): !lewd
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm personally not jealous of him
Aldus Larian (Jess): Me neither
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa don't be jealous of him u way cooler
Bill: Wait I think whose jealous of who?
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's because we turned the air conditioning on today!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I like hunter, I wont say I dont, but I feel marisa because I have an unfathomable hatred for accentkosses ever since she purposely ignores me last katsu so i genuinely understand that
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm a bit peeved at kiwi for breaking the rules for him also, other cosplayers should've been able to use that escalator space and not just the rwbies because it was a "special favor"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But I do think you should give him one last chance outside of a convention like bill said
Bill: You are so much more fun than Hunter.  You have the AURII love and that’s what matters ~~cause BNE could implode at some point~~.
N🆗ri (Marisa): grab ur pitchforks we're hunting accentkisses
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And if he still is a dick to you then I think we all need to reevaluate our friendship with him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Also yea I like you way more than hunter xD
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:minathink:544567715931750405> i give one (1) chance
because i gave him several at zenkaikon and he had no reason to mess them up
unless he was drunk/on drugs again because it was sunday morning and sometimes people get messed up saturday night?
N🆗ri (Marisa): WAIT WAIT I HAVE MEMES
Bill: Mawisa I love that you respect the rules, (except the rule about no hating Marisa, you’re a repeat offender) but *let them slide when it benefits ~~me~~ is*.
Bill: People are scatterbrained at cons, distracted, busy. He had a shoot schedule for Zenkai and that may have been stress.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I GOT HTE MESMS
Bill: It’s hard to really know people at the con.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm prepraed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Confirmed that’s leanna, I took that picture at Geekdom.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): if he's really that out of it then i propose a test
if i meet 'im at a party and get ignored i'll use my powers of ninjutsu stick a meme on his back and see how long it takes for him to notice it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Just do that to everyone tbh
N🆗ri (Marisa): "hey who's the chick with the doge on their shoulder?"
"oh she's the sister of dude with chuck testa on his back"
Bill: Marisa loses she broke the meme chain first! The loser is showered with love and affection till they DIE (of natural causes).
N🆗ri (Marisa): I HAVE ONE COPIED I WAS DEBATING POSTING IT OR NOT NO I NCA'T AHVE LOST
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm coming in with the big guns
N🆗ri (Marisa): DOOT DOOT
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's more impressive in person it just seems tiny in the jpeg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik):

Bill: Marisa still loses!
Aldus Larian (Jess): What is going on on in here <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): just u wait until my mom hears about this and calls all of your moms and brings it up at the next PTA meeting
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i ran out of memes this is just the first thing on my tumblr dash~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Cute potted plants? I'll take it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~this is the first thing on my dash and oh shit it's really cute~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The first thing on mine is brie Larson pelvic theistic 400lbs....so ... that's about where I stand in this
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mines this:
Bill: Disappointed that’s not an actual bourbon bottle.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well it's a stock photo so
Bill: Jessica Jones used real bourbons!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea cuz they prob got permission
