Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Thanks Hal <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Even though it's from the Endgame spoilers chat, it's regarding Avengers 1 and Captain Marvel, so don't freak out Bill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /everyone proceeds to ignore the large chunk of text
Bill: I stopped reading yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom explained to me that I completely misconstrued Marisa's comment the other day so now I feel less bad about my drawing but still kinda bad
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to kill everyone except jess and tom including myself
Aldus Larian (Jess): But not as bad. Now I just feel like I have a complex about having bad art and not so much having bad art
Aldus Larian (Jess): NOT ALLOWED
Bill: You are an artist then.
Bill: Megatokyo’s fred bitches 24/7 about his art talent being shit.
Bill: I own 6 published volumes of his work.
Bill: I’ve never met an artist whose confident in their own work. If I did, I’m pretty sure their work would be terrible.
Bill: I think the heavy self criticism somehow helps artists grow.
Bill: Even if it’s fucking terrible.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hmm see but I critize my art so much it cripples me from practicing
Bill: *learn to love your self loathing*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I literally draw, look at it, get embarrassed and not want to draw anymore
Bill: Yeah. I do the same thing. The fact that you keep doing it as much as you have is impressive!
Bill: Photography sealed the nail in the coffin of me ever learning to draw.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~its impressive cuz my art is terrible but I keep struggling anyway~~
Bill: ~~now you sound like an artist~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Bill: Lol it’s just what I observe from all the people I’ve met who draw.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean I know that other artists feel the exact same way
Bill: If you want to do more anime arting, would you like to borrow the books I have? I’ve got half a dozen books on drawing manga style.
Bill: I couldn’t learn from them myself though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk maybe
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just kinda wanted to vent about not so much "solve the problem"
Bill: Somewhere recently someone said that doing regular anatomy is helpful too, even for stylized stuff like anime. I never did that.
Bill: I promise, not trying to solve the problem. ~~lord knows I need to break that habit~~
Bill: Just putting the offer out if you decide.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also I wanted to apologise to <@301927856240459777>  for misunderstanding he comment in my moment of weakness
Bill: The books just gathering dust in my house anyway.
N🆗ri (Marisa): noooooo is ok, is me for saying something that could be construed as insulting
i'm preparing a shallow grave for myself as we speak
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess is an angel who can do no wrong
Bill: No dying Mawisa.
Bill: I have an IRREFUTABLE way to prove you shouldn’t.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it sylvia
Bill: ~~living is the real suffering~~
Bill: Sylvia is the real answer.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||yee she's one of the two things holding me back <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> ||
Bill: But also I dunno what I’d do without daily Marisa conversation either.
Bill: ❤️🧡💚💙💛💜
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nuuuuu I was the worng one to even think you would say something less than complimentary
N🆗ri (Marisa): daily mystic messenger <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Marisa > mystic messenger
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am a ball of mean rage who tears apart the feelings of others
Bill: You don’t ask if I ate every five seconds.
N🆗ri (Marisa): brb changing my instagram to "mean girls irl"
N🆗ri (Marisa): *but you do* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *did you eat*
Bill: *my trigger finger is itchy*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i got a jar of pickles today <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> i can still taste the vinegar
N🆗ri (Marisa): i also made a ton of soup because we got groceries but when it was done i put it away and made curry instead
Bill: Food for later is good.
Bill: *You ate the curry though*
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's gonna sit in the fridge for 3 months and get moldy like the last soup <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo snacks all day instead of eating meals, and i don't like to eat without bojo because it's a breach in etiquette and she might be hungry later. so what happens is the good food we get will sit untouched for weeks since each of us is saving it for the other, and it goes bad <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Look there was even space on the counter for it
Bill: You’re so silly.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOA FOOD
Bill: *Did you eat the curry*
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye owo
Bill: I can close the dominos app then.
Bill: Apparently dominos is still open!
N🆗ri (Marisa): that must be a glitch
N🆗ri (Marisa): they all permanently closed
N🆗ri (Marisa): like blockbuster
N🆗ri (Marisa): except for maybe one independently run one in alaska
N🆗ri (Marisa): am trying to think of party food. idk if we should go with cupcakes or make an icebox cake
Bill: *1am*
Bill: *2pm on weekends*
Bill: *good to know*
Bill: You should email @chef about it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): chef ram g-sama
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh they sell macaroni at the dollar store we could do a big tub of that
Bill: Owo!
N🆗ri (Marisa): my sister did tacos at her party but the tortillas stuck to each other so maybe nacho bar
Bill: I can’t wait to have a party for Mawisa.
Bill: *Will I be able to fit all the gifts in the car*
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes because there will be no gifts
Aldus Larian (Jess): We bring food!
N🆗ri (Marisa): is ok! no need to go out of your way and spend money or bother yourself!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa I just watch Tom cook a whole platter of stuffed peppers at 10:00 at night for a work party.
Aldus Larian (Jess): We bring food
N🆗ri (Marisa): the 10:00pm Mood
Bill: Okay. I won’t bother myself, and I won’t go out of my way to spend money.
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is leading to something. i feel it in my bones.
N🆗ri (Marisa): a premonition.
N🆗ri (Marisa): change of topic before it gets there i'm thinking of activities and i'm considering maybe trivia maybe charades idk
Bill: I will buy things for Mawisa because I am bothered when I don’t and I won’t go out of my way to spend money on Mawisa because it’s *easy to spend money on mawisa.*
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe synchronized dancing
Bill: I’ll have you know I laughed aloud at your premonition.
N🆗ri (Marisa): new fun game idea: sneak presents into the cars of people who bought them
Bill: Imma have to get more sneaky about giving Mawisa things.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm inviting harrison he's a cop
Bill: Arrest me for giving you things.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know i have Your Name somewhere but if i can't find that idk which movie to put on for potential post party film
In This Corner Of The World <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: That would be illegal cause it’s not s crime.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh that's on my Netflix list
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!!! it is on netflix!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea!
Bill: Imma bring so much dominos to this party.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo maybe wolf children but my aunt and uncle have seen that already and idk if they gonna stay to gossip in the back
N🆗ri (Marisa): could watch Maquia but that was such a letdown
N🆗ri (Marisa): boy and the beast!
N🆗ri (Marisa): summer wars! patema inverted! lady hokusai! so many choices
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Perfect blue
N🆗ri (Marisa): tragic wwii films are fine but Satoshi Kon films are where i draw the line
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe i can find a copy of Fuse Teppou Musume
Bill: K-on movie good idea.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know what we're gonna watch
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6plfatHWGwI
Bill: ~~Eiken movie~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): There's just something about a little girl talking about getting head from her huns
N🆗ri (Marisa): we're going to watch boro the caterpillar so i can see what it's like for a roomfull of people to die on the inside
N🆗ri (Marisa): WAIT WHAT
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Have you ever read the lyrics to this song :3c?
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I HAVE NOW
N🆗ri (Marisa): hhhhhhhhnjmhgwtfgrhjmk
Bill: Is this gap moe?
N🆗ri (Marisa): there are tears
N🆗ri (Marisa): the shock
N🆗ri (Marisa): i need
N🆗ri (Marisa): anything except that video
N🆗ri (Marisa): courage to tell a lie 10 hour loop here i come
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnLGWph0VZ0
Elfriede Faun (Tom): perfection
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***i know the lyrics to this one***
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AMMAMUMAUMUAMUMMAMUMAU DESU NE ARARARARARGI SAN
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think there's a microphone at the office
karaoke
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Plz send me fun questions to answer on Instagram
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My ear is killing itself
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Congestion is real
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I hate allergies, how is it that people can be allergic to nature
Bill: The outdoors wants to kill you.
Bill: That’s why I got me an indoors career.
Bill: Also I’m not continuing open conversations via Instagram lol
Bill: *although that could be an amusing challenge...*
Bill: I do love saying things only via the subtext. It’s like code.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am out of the loop and confused <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Sneaking crap under the radar. Then turning doing so to convey the original message.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the rain in spain falls directly on the plain
Bill: It’s hard to make an example, but like... let’s say I asked a question to Georgia. Because of some knowledge she knows prior, she understands what I’m talking about. But without that shared piece of information, the question looks like it about something else.
Bill: Then imagine having an entire conversation like that.
Bill: On a public scale of Georgia’s Instagram.
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's so passive aggressive
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain
N🆗ri (Marisa): ow yeah that's odd THAT'S IT THAT'S THE QUOTE
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk what i'm thinking of i've never seen the movie <:lenny:395307171539189760>
how cultured
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was one of my lines/songs in My Fair Lady!
N🆗ri (Marisa): you were in it? :0 a play?
Bill: I’m not even talking about some dark secret, like discussing dinner plans but keeping the entirety of Instagram from figuring it out.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was Henry Higgings
Bill: Which is why it’s a challenge.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yooo das neat. an actor woah
Bill: ~~in my paraphrase before I realized that the concept is actually very similar to a cryptographic algorithm used in computers and that’s crazy~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): like what they use in war?
Bill: I mean. You use it whenever you go on amazon too.
Bill: Cryptography is everywhere.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): look at this blurry photo of us doing that song!
Bill: Just call me God Bill, Defender of Justice. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): too poweful for the stage
N🆗ri (Marisa): too much good energy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Plz stop
Bill: ~~I know no one cares about this but I just realized another parallel to another cryptographic algorithm and that’s really exciting to me~~
Bill: Seeing concepts that take place in computer system come from a source in reality is so *cool.*
N🆗ri (Marisa): wouldn't all computer concepts come from reality? :0
Bill: True. But they don’t originate from the concept.
Bill: Cryptography is founded in math.
Bill: You look at the math in order to improve cryptography.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _gotta go fast_
Bill: What.
Aldus Larian (Jess): We all know math isn't real
Bill: These comparisons show the logic behind the math. That if you hold a shared secret you can communicate without revealing the information to anyone who hears the normal message. Computers use math to do that. People can use knowledge to do the same thing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Logic is a lie
Bill: What else do we do as people that can be reflected in an algorithm? Is it a better way of doing “the math” than anyone has ever tried?
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's just a variation of language, or a new language.
using math as a language
that's why math isn't real
Bill: Rather than improve the math, change the methodology.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~Someone ask me how I’m doing better than I was a few months ago, that’s subtext for Hal~~
Bill: Hal doesn’t read subtext.
Bill: I’m going to kill my self in the morning for still being up.
N🆗ri (Marisa): literally or
Bill: Not literally.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can't wait to see him post these before giving Georgia and me ours 🙃
Bill: Nyahaha.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: ~~we should shoot Yang and Taiyang and I’ll do the photos quick and release them in the channel before he does his~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Wow bill thanks for such a quick turnaround time!”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is there such thing as petty photoshooting
Bill: Why not.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): No we need to do bees again
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then it'll be *really* petty
Bill: Oh wait right, you did bees.
Bill: I meant to say the same shoot.
Bill: *i don’t pull da punches*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): let's just go back to Lancaster and shoot in the same spots
Bill: Snrk.
Bill: It’s surprisingly tempting, and landcaster isn’t my favorite place to shoot at all.
Bill: It should be ESPECIALLY obvious the whole thing is a dig at him cause my turn arounds are usually weeks.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LIKE I just feel!??? Like he didn’t really give a shit???? That hurts the most because the slow turnaround when everyone else has gotten photos back just reinforces the point
Bill: I’ll also be sure to say I was excited to post about the gallery so I finished and returned them first cause that’s what you do.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): especially since he seemed bored and burnt out while we were shooting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He wasn’t prepared beforehand, the shoot was over so quickly, he wasted time showing us OTHER photos, and now he’s taking forever to get back
Bill: He’s not professional.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): indeed he is not
Bill: He’s treating it far too casually, even if he was burnt out on the shoot.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like he could shoot like that as a friend but if he’s tryna make money he’s doing a bad
Bill: I wouldn’t do that to a friend. >.>
Aldus Larian (Jess): How was he on your shoot with kissy Erik?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye if money was paid it should be treated professionally, even if done with friends
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn it phone
Bill: Even if the shoot came out bad, I’d *say that* to you as to why I’m not getting much back to you.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I could talk to him about it ... constructive criticism. I dont think talking like this behind his back without ever expressing your feelings or even asking him about the photos is going to help him in any way
Bill: But also the expectation of paying a photographer is you get quality work in their style. He needs to be able to produce something for everyone who pays for him, it’ll be bad for his “brand”.
Bill: Leanna is absolutely correct.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i had a shoot with paul williams once, the guy who keeps posting in the animenext photographers page. it was a great shoot and afterwards when he sent me the edited photos he said he didn't like them and refunded all of my money, and promised that if i booked him again with the same costume he'd do better
that's mega professional <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He most likely doesnt think it's a problem because no one has ever said anything to him. But, you guys really should say something about it
Bill: He’ll never learn from the mistake if it’s not told to him.
Bill: I considered bringing it up... but we aren’t really friends so I don’t know how well he’d take constructive criticism from me, on a topic I’m unrelated to.
Bill: And my want to help him is less than my urge to not rock the boat in BNE.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like I probably ahpuldnt be the one telling him, but if you guys dont want to I'm all for taking that bullet
Bill: Leanna defender of justice
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Communication is important
Bill: It should be you two though.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I did mention something after he posted about his post doing well
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Especially with hunter, who probably just doesnt realize hes doing anything wrong
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): doubt he saw it
Bill: You can even tell him so much as you aren’t planning on shooting with him again because of the experience (if you aren’t but I get that vibe). Really give him the bad yelp review experience.
Bill: But he may take it personally.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, it wasn't blatantly asking him for them, but it was kind of subtly hinting that we're anxious for them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Did you say it to him in a DM? Or like... directly Express that you expected photos back before he posted one himself? Because passive aggressive doesnt get through to him
Bill: Can always state “this isn’t about our friendship, this is about our professional relation ship as client photographer”. That’d drill the point home he needs to be more professional.
Bill: Yeah the PA thing wasn’t strong Erik.
Bill: At all.
Bill: I wouldn’t have read it that way if I didn’t have the context from here.
Bill: And being PA wont help him.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea, same. Like I get that it's scary to confront people but, it's better to communicate your frustrations than to just sit on them and stew. 

It's fun to be petty sometimes, but it really isnt helpful in this kind of situation where it genuinely is something hunter needs to learn from.
Bill: She right.
Bill: I’ve been enjoying it a bit too, cause I was jealous y’all were shooting with him whoops.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): DM'd him
Bill: But there’s no reason to not try and help him.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Good! I think that's a way better approach
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Hey so I know you're probably tired from the weekend and bust with other stuff, but since you posted one of the photos from the shoot Georgia and I did with you, I was wondering if you were close to finishing that set yet? We're really eager to see the rest of the photos. Thanks"*
Bill: ~~asides from the part where he bailed from the photography friends server~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's much better Erik. I think that conveys a lot more than the message in BNE did
N🆗ri (Marisa): the server thing was funny
Bill: It was.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Lmao
Bill: I know the server is dead right now.
Bill: But guy that was SUPER OBVIOUS.
N🆗ri (Marisa): do you know how long he was in it for
Bill: Nah.
Bill: Minutes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): just sucks we gotta tell him tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah :/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): feels like he didnt really care from the beginning of the process to the end
Bill: I mean.
Bill: Kinda.
Bill: Which I can *somewhat* get, by making it more professional it may have felt like work for him.
Bill: But by making it more professional you are promising you’ll provide work of a certain quality.
Bill: That’s why you’re getting paid to do it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I understand editing and returning photos takes time, but it's been 6 weeks...
Bill: Consider you telling him a good deed. A better good deed than the one for Scott.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and he only works part time doesn't he?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I get that, it does suck. But, hes ..... kinda ditzy and needs to be told things straight up sometimes. Hes struggling to transition from doing free friend shoots to being a "professional"
Bill: School and work.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh right he's still in school
Bill: ~~if Hunters work is worth 40 bucks imma easily say I could charge 60~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And if no one ever tells him anything hes doing wrong, hes going to continue doing those things.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah im worried that the returns arent even gonna be good tbh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he didnt get THAT many photos
Bill: Nope.
Bill: He took like two in the garage and was like “I’m good with this spot” and I was like “whaaaa you didn’t even try a different pose”
Bill: It’s like he did hall shots in a variety of locations.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): well the garage we kinda got kicked out of
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah he'd do like one pose and take a couple shots, mostly to get lighting right, but once he got one (1) he was happy with he moved on.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> you’ve shot with lots of photographers, when you get a time slot of X minutes, is travel time between locations usually included? Or do they usually stay in one spot?
Bill: Or does it count as part of the time you’re paying for?
Bill: To me I feel like if I want to travel, it shouldn’t cut into the paid time.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): well he was shooting all day... i feel like he shouldve known where to meet us to shoot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I wont lie, I prefer that to getting a bunch of poses in one location. But is it worth what hes charging? No probably not
Bill: There’s nothing wrong with moving during a shoot, don’t get me wrong.
Bill: I’m just thinking about if that’s “billable” time in the industry.
Bill: ~~I’ve set the bar for photographer too high is all~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I liked that we did get a few locations which is why I feel like we got more than we might have. We only had two locations with Lissy and we didn't even get the number of photos back we were supposed to
Bill: :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmmm. depends on the photographer. i usually do 30 minute time slots, sometimes they'll stay in one spot or the same general area the whole time even if it's not quite working out. sometimes we'll go all over the con and run around.

it's rare to not take pictures in the spot where we meet up though. a lot will base the meetup spot on the character so we can begin immediately. usually the only time we move to another location is if it's outside the con center or the con doesn't have any easily identifiable landmarks, like how old otakon had indoor and outdoor fountains.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but with Georgia we had 3 locations
Bill: Yeah even if he turns around and has the shoot for you... you should still tell him all the things that upset you.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Agreed
Bill: He needs to know the things you didn’t like.
Bill: For the ones you travel, how much of those 30 minutes is spent shooting versus moving?
N🆗ri (Marisa): like the last 3 times i've shot with sam:
1.) Neon we met just outside the con and started taking pictures there, then moved to another location
2.) Selkie we met at the con center but moved to another location a few blocks away and shot there the whole time
3.) Katarina we stayed in one spot the entire time, which was the meetup spot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it felt like 20 mins moving for 10 minutes shooting man idk
Bill: I think it’s gotta be at a minimum 50% shooting.
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm. the only time there should be that much moving around is if you're not on any kind of timer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably seemed longer to me because I had back-to-back shoots
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and he spent like 5 minutes showing me photos of meg lIKE DUDE
Bill: Yeah your example Mawisa are pretty straight forward. Meet at either the location or a public place to move to the location, shoot, transition if you’ve used the main spot up.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he also cut mine and Lissy's short so she could go do her other thing and was like "I have you for another shoot so I can get your solo shots then"
N🆗ri (Marisa): the only paid shoot that had a lot of travelling for me, we walked to a chapel near the con center that took a little while to get to, but nancy didn't have anything else going on for a while so we were able to shoot as long as we wanted

yeah showing pictures of other shoots is unprofessional. if you're at a shoot that means you already know the photographer's work
Bill: Yeah. I’ll wander with no schedule, which I like doing.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I dont mind moving a lot if it means getting good photos back. But if the photos arent very good and you're unhappy with them then I think that's a problem.
Bill: I also catalogue shoot locations as I walk the con to know where to start a timed shoot.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like if you consistently get a good set of photos back and you spent 20 mins walking and 10 shooting, then the travel time doesnt really matter if you got back great shots.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But if you get back shots that are ... bleh
Bill: Yeah....
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah! if a photographer isn't familiar with the con center they'll usually text/e-mail the client beforehand once they've arrived at the con and scouted a good spot
Bill: ^ done that
N🆗ri (Marisa): old otakon had so many good spots <:rip:369476083248267274>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): not gonna lie, not really a fan of the parking garage
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so unless the photos come back amazing i think its just gonna feel lame having shot there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i imagine the only good ones are gonna be in that park bench brick area
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the only cool thing I remember was my ribbon blowing in the wind
Bill: ~~the light is terrible in the brick area so he’s going to have a bitch of a time with those~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): rwby shoot when
Bill: Has to do with all the brick as far as I can tell, it bounces the light weirdly.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he photos good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but as far as being a _photographer_ professionally he has a lot to go
Bill: Only way that’ll change is if you tell him so.
Bill: Oof. I’m still jealous you guys thought he was worth the 40 bucks, ngl. Not that I ask for or want compensation, but like... I guess it’s the sense of value being attached to you being willing to pay that. =T 

It’s not a competition though, different people bring different things to the table. Imma try to remember that and give the snickering a break.
Bill: I’m not getting more than 5 hours of sleep tonight and I’m an idiot for it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes you're busy though, or you don't like the shoot content, or you have a lot of shoots already
and ye sometimes gotta spice up the pictures by trying a different photographer
so much would be solved with communism why must it be so flawed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): overall, this has just been a learning experience for multiiple parties
Bill: ~~I’m a jealous SoB~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think part of the reason was like, he's trying to make this a career so I wanted to support him by being a customer... but after this experience, it's unlikely I'll book with him again :/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which is odd because the Summer Lovin' shoot I did wasn't as bad an experience and the GB RWBY at CCE (which Will paid for) was actually a really good experience?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so idk :/
Bill: Burn out?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah i wanted to support him starting a career, and give money to his top surgery, and when he tries he can produce some cool content
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i like diversity of photographer styles
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think if I want to throw money at a photographer, I'll go with someone else
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like kaseicosplay!
N🆗ri (Marisa): misspelled tilt worm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah! Kaseicosplay!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): KASEICOSPLAY!
N🆗ri (Marisa): tilt worm and then kasei cosplay shadows him from behind a tree 3 stories up
N🆗ri (Marisa): literal sniping at work
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hunter is very hit or miss imo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m forever in love with these two photos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I don’t really care for some of the other pics he’s gotten of me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, this was cool as shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I think what sparked his obsession with colored gels
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Even though these were just lights that cycled through colors in the one bar
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OWO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so hunter did the photos all along, he just forgot about them
Bill: Still not professional, but just incompetent as opposed to maliciously so. That’s better, should have gave him benefit of the doubt.
Bill: *still appreciate you local ~~gunfighter~~ photographer tho*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh garage one is weird but mostly because I'm so tall and it looks like I'm hitting my head
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Selfie one is cute tho
Bill: Best one is the sitting on the bench one.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm glad we at least got the maximum number of photos returned for the package we paid for
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): compared to his other shoots that weekend i think those shots are pretty good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the change of scenery i think helped a lot, so it mightve been worth it to be walking around a lot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye
Bill: Mm.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~at least it wasnt 5 more photos in front of the hallway lights~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~^^^~~
Bill: He didn’t manage them as well as I did. And even at that, I only really clicked with it for the last shoot there. ~~which was Georgia’s~~
Bill: I don’t know how anyone chooses which 8 or whatever to return in a set. That’s another layer of stress like, why.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wasn't there a photographer Marisa worked with whi would send a few thumbnails and she got to choose which ones she got back? Or am I thinking of someone else
Bill: We talk about that, it’s fairly common practice for photographers to do when talking about prints.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because I think that would be a good way to do it. Let your customer decide which ones they get back
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because they could have been excited about a certain pose they did only to not get it with the returns
Bill: Contact sheets.
Bill: That’s what they’re called.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah those
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my photographer at katsu did something similar, he gave me all the photos he took back in a folder and asked me which ones i would like to have fully edited by him and the rest were fair game for me to edit myself as long as i credited him for the photo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think that worked out pretty well
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and that was 40 dollars and i got 2 about 20 photos back, 3 edits, ~~and also a whole second shoot for free because i smuggled him into the buildin... but thats not part of the deal lmao~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah that's a really good way of doing it
Bill: If the photographer is comfortable with you doing edits.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, they took all those photos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i mean i always ask first obviously
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and wouldnt edit them if he didnt want me to
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but even without edits they were still pretty solid
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i just like to brush up lighting and get rid of like...wires showing in penny
Bill: Mhmm, no doubt. I’m saying some photographers wouldn’t want edits done by other people.
Bill: Not all of course.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i get that, but if thats the case i would hope they would return more than 3 edited photos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): for that amount of money
Bill: Mhmm.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): unless its like a minishoot
Bill: Depends on the extent of the editing too.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): true
Bill: 3 edits with flames and lightning and shit is a lot more time per image than color/light corrections.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh yea, thats valid as fuck
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but you still know what youre getting beforehand, usually
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my point was basically that hunter needs to either allow people to pick which photos they want, or have a more consistent return rate
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i might bring that up, just as a personal complaint
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): to him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause that seems to be an ongoing issue
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): where often people who shoot with him really look forward to certain photos and then never see them in the returns
Bill: It seems like he didn’t get enough keepers from the shoots, to me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): still something to discuss
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not just about zenkai
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): just in general
Bill: It took a lot of experimenting and testing for me to get every shot I was doing with the wall lights, him rushing that area probably left him with nothing worthy enough to return.
Bill: Which is a real fear.
Bill: You can’t let that happen as a pro, but.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, paid shoots shouldnt really be for experimentation
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and if they are you should get the cosplayers permission to use their paid time for that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or reimburse them >.>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think he needs to decide on a set number for returns rather than a range
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea he does
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like someone could pay $30 and get 6 photos back or $45 and get 7 (~~or 5 in some cases~~) and where is the fairness in that?
Bill: They can be, but you have to guarantee something first. Shoot somewhere safe to start first, or if the new cool thing flops, offer to continue the shoot past time to make sure they get the minimum number of shots they paid for.
Bill: Wow fuck this. I don’t pay three times the cost of the subway to not be allowed on the upper deck of the ferry.
Bill: Just what my morning needed.
Bill: I haven't shaved in a week, and while I still don't have anything beyond neckbeard it's been heckin itchy today.
Bill: I want to try and go at least two weeks to see if I can get *something* going.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): When someone from high school hits you up on Hinge <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: Hey at least it’s a match.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She had a crush on me back then and I didn't really reciprocate. She was nice though. Maybe wouldn't hurt to open that friendship back up
Bill: ~~they say you’ll on average match every 2-3 days on dating sites but I’ve never seen that~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I got two other ones yesterday, but I wasn't really into them~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~oof I'm sorry Bill~~
Bill: See now that’s what I expect from you tho my guy. You not getting matches on bumble was weird to me, you’ve got a good look.
Bill: And tol is apparently a turn on for people.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it depends how picky you are i think
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if you swipe right on everyone then you'll obviously have better chances of matching, but if you hella picky then your chances are a lot slimmer obviously
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like chris is super picky and he hasnt had a match at all ever and has been using bumble for like 6 months
Bill: ~~dating apps are entirely judgements based on appearance so there’s a handicap there~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and on top of that he has it set for both men and women
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm very picky
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think thats good though, being picky is better than just swiping right on everyone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They can be a little personality based
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): mhmm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m not on apps but I see all the time that people say their hobby is Netflix
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NETFLIX ISNT A HOBBY
Bill: I did redownload hinge when you mentioned though. I quickly remembered why I dropped that. In this area it’s apparently the app for trans guys, people who think a single photo of their dog represents them entirely, people who take selfies of their eye and put nothing else down...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea^ i wont swipe right unless their profile is good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the office is not a personality trait
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah one pic and no bio is an instant nope
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeeeeep
Bill: Pretty cringey stuff. (Not the first one, that’s just not my speed)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): snapchat filters on every photo is also a nope
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): as is sunglasses
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or group photos
Bill: Mhmm. I read the profile too.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): UGH GROUP PHOTOS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “Which one r u tho”
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL YEA
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i wont even go any further into the profile if their first photo is a group
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's when I really realize that basic white girls really do all look the same
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dlshfskdh THEY DO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I, a blonde haired blue eyed white girl, can agree
Bill: Mhmm. Lots of common tropes in profiles.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Vape cloud is instant nope
Bill: ~~since when do you use dating apps~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I made Tyler and sams profile
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Sam just went on a date with a girl he matched with!
Bill: Anyway I'm glad you're getting hits Erik. Like I said it didn't make sense to me you weren't.
Aldus Larian (Jess): IF YOU KNOW TOUCHING WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE IS "POLITICALLY INCORRECT" THEN. DON'T. DO. IT.
Bill: sounds like someone in your office needs to get hit by a car.
Aldus Larian (Jess): a few
Aldus Larian (Jess): every guy over the age of 50 touches me when they talk to me
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/4519885/android/sticker.png;compress=true
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then they try to like "make fun of" being "politically incorrect" to lighten to mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): what the fuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): dont. fucking. touch. me. ugh a guy at the bar the other night bumped into me and then apologizes and then proceeded to rub my shoulder for like way longer than needed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...... not to be like .. a man hater.. but .....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Bill: what the fuck you just. Apologize and move on?
Bill: Don't... do more of what you just apologized for?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): specifically men who dont understand boudaries
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck off with that fdghkshdl
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bite them
N🆗ri (Marisa): Angrily
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): can we make "fuckboi" and "gross old man" their own genders to separate them from the actual decent men out there?
Aldus Larian (Jess): taste like old man cologne tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): valid erik
N🆗ri (Marisa): There was an incident in an Otakon room where a guy was trying to get past a girl adjusting her wig in the mirror, and put his hands on her hips to move past her. She appropriately caused a ruckus and then he complained the rest of the weekend she was too sensitive.
Aldus Larian (Jess): like my youger male co workers NEVER touch me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): those are very specific types of people and they dont deserve to be called men
N🆗ri (Marisa): clown babies
Aldus Larian (Jess): like i just find it annoying that they litterally point out its wring and then laugh it off like "haha stupid PC BS"
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maintain very intense eye contact the whole time to establish dominance
Bill: Nothing says sorry by saying “I didn’t have to apologize anyway”.
Bill: ~~and to think, these guys are married~~
Glonk: Mainto very intense eye contact and t-pose the whole time to establish dominance* ftfy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Mmm. Our internet got shut off in the middle of my work. Rest in pieces.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Iiiiii don’t know our account number to pay and  get it back on <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I guess it’s cosplay time
Bill: Oof
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Big oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): the internet is back <:rise:557579163511554050> 
i went *outside* ugh it was disgusting but i had to ask bojo where the unpaid bill was <:lenny:395307171539189760>
was also able to get pictures of the meeting hall. worse for photos than i remember rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ughhhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ALSO IS THAT THE PAR TAY ROOM
Bill: grab me if anyone asks a (non stupid) question about the laser tag thing (looking at you Matt). I'm not feeling so hot so I want to close discord.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH it smells a little funny like old meeting halls do but maybe if i throw some cinnamon around it'll not smell
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WE PARTY HERE??
N🆗ri (Marisa): YE IF PEOPLE WANT TO COME
it has walls <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> and chairs
it'll be decorated i promise
N🆗ri (Marisa): gotta have that american flag
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im dumb, what was the occasion again?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean we dont need an excuse to party but if its thematic i need a thematic card
N🆗ri (Marisa): graduation/birthday/random occasion to dance
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): when mawisa birth?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've got a card from japan i've been meaning to give you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HOW OLD YEBE
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was years ago, centuries
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am old now
N🆗ri (Marisa): brittle bones
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): June borth?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i sit in the garden and think about life
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw may, but the party is on the same day as my graduation would be and it's close enough
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NICU
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): color theme?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): do i gotta wear a color?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): murder mystery?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): bring my own knife?
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg is color theme really so important
bojo's been talking about that, she's bought red and white stuff because that's tumblrs colors
N🆗ri (Marisa): teMPLE
N🆗ri (Marisa): TEMPLES COLORS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what should we cosplay?
N🆗ri (Marisa): there u go that's the real question
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am torn because on one hand it's fun to get all dressed up fancy
but on the other hand a lot of people i'm inviting are giant slobs who don't own clothes nicer than regular jeans (which, not knocking them or putting them down, but it clashes with a formal attire theme)
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok i wear maroon and white
N🆗ri (Marisa): fashion <:woah:543194447345876998>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): masquerade theme
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): decorate your own mask
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /just wears ladybug
N🆗ri (Marisa): fun party ideas: an "about [party person]" quiz with weirdly specific questions

1.) what was [party person] doing at 6:54 on January 5th 2008?
2.) if [party person] was extremely thirsty and running late and missed their intended train, and decided to take a different train in 3 minutes, and knew there was a vending machine 1 minute away, what would they do?
N🆗ri (Marisa): LADYBUG PARTY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mawisa trivia?
N🆗ri (Marisa): am trying to think of ways to keep everyone entertained
N🆗ri (Marisa): might do bar style trivia for everyone and have a paper trivia about me to cover my narcissistic tendencies
N🆗ri (Marisa): trivia about my cat pls
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and pass BNE the answers rightP_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): is there dress code?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i wear cute clothes? _or cosplay_
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmmmm probably not
*wear all the cute cosplay* 🙏 
there's not really an area to take pictures but there is a playground outside
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, my sister wore a button up shirt to her own wedding
i'd like to make it a fancy dress party but that probably isnt happening
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): we can make it happen!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): at least for us
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i has cute dresses
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): fancy bows
N🆗ri (Marisa): *free bows for all*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHOA REALLY
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can!!!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cool party favors!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): is sylvia the guest of honor? does she get a cool throne and we line up to give her offerings
N🆗ri (Marisa): finding activities for everyone is a pain because we're sending invites to phd-holding university professors, people who literally own universities, and rednecks who steal things for a living
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): do we get to pet cat
N🆗ri (Marisa): sylvia is always the guest of honor
she won't be there in person 😭 but she'll be very near by!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): a framed photo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): we leave offerings
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i wear cute dress then ok that good
N🆗ri (Marisa): the stealing things is also not a jab, their self professed occupation is "selling things that fall off the back of trucks"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiG_dfBuYfiAhWQg-AKHQJSAM8QjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fgallery%2FtleVt&psig=AOvVaw0njbzN901i4hnhSx5HflPN&ust=1557250816592607
N🆗ri (Marisa): dress code: cult robes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://imgur.com/gallery/tleVt
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ill have my cult robes dry cleaned then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _we dance?_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://i.imgur.com/uHDzq2l.gif
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *fucking finally*
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye! i'll be sure to leave space for dancing
i gotta come up with a playlist that fits normies and weebs
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MACARENA
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was wondering what was happening with the cat pictures i was in such suspense
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no matter what itll definitely be better than the zenkai formal
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm going to make any high school friends that show up suffer by playing the music they made us synchronize dance to in gym class
N🆗ri (Marisa): electric slide
macarena
alley cat
N🆗ri (Marisa): flashbacks to the thick existential dread that filled the gymnasium when cotton eye joe would come on
Glonk: 1 hop this time
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _3000 hops this time_
N🆗ri (Marisa): that song "our house in the middle of the street"
but the version that just goes "our house in the middle of our house in the middle of our house" on loop for an hour
N🆗ri (Marisa): gangnam style
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 🎵 and they dont stop comin and they dont stop comin 🎵
N🆗ri (Marisa): why don't i just play the shrek soundtrack
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): kick the door in some-BODY
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀 yes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That reminds me someone replace the chained ogre in sekiro with Shrek and it's amazing
https://kotaku.com/shrekiro-1834490477
N🆗ri (Marisa): free him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 25 minutes early for an interview phew
Bill: Good luck.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I am Scared™️ but I typically interview well so here’s to hoping 👏
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good luck!
Bill: You’ll be fine.
Bill: Just don’t introduce yourself as wezrez cosplay.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What a weird interview
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The lady was really scatterbrained
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I interviewed the best I possibly could
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I left that interview just feeling weird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): :/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hate those kinds of interviews
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I'm sure you did your best
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my parents keep freaking out about what time I should be leaving for the airport tomorrow. Like, I'm being very conscious of it too because it's like, an hour away and I need to factor in traffic, but they're acting as though it's going to take like 5 hours to get there
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've been checking Waze at different times and it always says it's going to be close to an hour. Like, it's still rush hour and even then it says it'll only take 51 minutes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The was a meme about that

Something like: "My dad leaving for the airport at 11pm for a 10am flight"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And it was like a dude drifting
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like I plan on going in to work an hour early so I can leave an hour early. That means I leave at 3:30. My flight is 6:43 so even if it took two hours to get there, that still gives me over an hour to check in, go through security, and get to my gate
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeee always gotta get to the airport as soon as humanly possible
N🆗ri (Marisa): what airport are you using? newark or philly?
Bill: Lol Erik no where near Phili.
Bill: Newark!
Bill: Newark I meant Newark.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm nowhere near newark but i've flown to japan out of there because it's sometimes cheaper <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): quadruple the driving time but saves $100
N🆗ri (Marisa): you gonna check luggage?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've got the airport scare fever. i gotta get there as early as possible. i was stressed in japan that i couldn't leave my apartment until after 10am, meaning i wouldn't get to the airport until noon for my flight that left at like 4 or 6pm or such
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm going to ABE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lehigh Valley
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean I want to get there early too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I think leaving at 3:30 for a 6:43 flight I *should* be fine
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can't wait to get there before 5 and text them saying "made it to the airport" and them be like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:woah:543194447345876998> i've never heard of that one
no idea there was another international airport around <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: That makes sense.
Bill: Info’s corroborated on other pages too.
Bill: Yikes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's someone in my backyard 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Did you wave at them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Maybe say hi
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't know them <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
but i think they're fixing the fence?
N🆗ri (Marisa): the gate on our fence has been laying on the ground for like a month
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone else broke it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): New friend!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i guess someone got really fed up with our gate being on the ground and is fixing it lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was just vaguely horrifying to turn around and see someone behind me, even if it was through a window 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ugh now mom's like "Make sure you dress nicely. You never know who you could be sitting next to! Could be your future spouse or your next boss..."
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😑
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *she said I should wear a polo....*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yuck
N🆗ri (Marisa): on the plane? that's so old fashioned :3c
Bill: ...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): once I sit down, the earbuds are going in and I don't talk to anyone
N🆗ri (Marisa): could be sitting next to your worst enemy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my flight home I chose a solo seat for that exact reason lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): tell your mom "i always dress nice" <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I'll be wearing my Crocs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): to get through security faster
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): should I wear my neutral brownish ones or my bright red ones
Aldus Larian (Jess): bright red go all out
