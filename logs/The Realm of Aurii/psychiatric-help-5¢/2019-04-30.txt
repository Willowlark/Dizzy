Bill: Oof only Rebecca replies about photography discord.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i wanna join but i dont do photography, i just am decent at editing
Bill: That’s valid too.
Bill: I suppose it’s only Hunter and Lissy outside of her anyway, Lissy doesn’t check it and Hunter probably considers himself above this kind of thing.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hunter also hasnt been online
Bill: True.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): id say give is some time, ill go comment on it to kinda boost it again xD
Bill: I drafted an insta post for it earlier but figured it’d wait and and do BNE first.
Bill: I’d hope I can get Zeikani and maybe David.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jamie can be flaky... I hope she doesn’t flake on this group 🙏🙏🙏
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): luckily i think tony might be a popular one if anyone else ends up joining

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~really wish anna wanted to do tony~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~she would suffer through an Iron Man build~~

Bill: Smart.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If he reaches out to you about it, then you're in trouble
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But that would mean he would have to actually cosplay a different character than Nora
Bill: That reminds me I should unfriend him.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he also has never spoken to me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): other than this comment
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so im just going to ignore it

Bill: Yo Denville must spike their blonde roast damn.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so we have a "Workman's Comp Audit" today and I was instructed to only work in my office today so like, no going out onto the floor to do anything
Bill: Lol.
Bill: I saw a Nissan Altima with a Texas plate and did I a drive by to check if it was Ethan. Was not.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought he drove some shitty VW?
Bill: I was pretty sure it wasn’t based on his observance of the speed limit.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof I’m definitely dying
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Allergies are so bad today
Bill: Yeah I could smell the pollen coming into my car.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I took Allegra, did a salt water gargle, took Flonase, and have a stash of cough drops
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was so bad I couldn’t talk this morning
Bill: oof. The parking lot walk alone has me feeling crappy again too.
Bill: Stay inside best ye can.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Walking to class will murder me oof
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): become bubble boy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _do you ever feel like a plastic bag_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Because I fucking do with all this pollen
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its perfect for you
Bill: HUH.
Aldus Larian (Jess): pretty sure i have a throat infection caused by allergies which is now causing an ear infection
Bill: I didn't mention last week, that photographer girl from the workshop did eventually message me back 'thanks, should do some photo stuff soon' to which I asked 'what do you have in mind' and she didn't reply again.
Bill: I just got another message about asking if I want to second shoot a wedding.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do itttt
Bill: I've been saying I don't want to weddings since before we've met Georgiaaaa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But there’s no pressure it’s just fuuuuun
Bill: I'm only googling what second shooter even is now, but it doesn't sound no pressure.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no pressure, just taking photos of the most memorable day of someone's life. no bigie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye but you ain’t the main photographer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There’s no pressure on you to get EVERYTHING
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof I’ve landed in my seat now I won’t move for a long time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.tomrobak.com/edu/how-to-be-a-second-shooter-at-a-wedding/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): might be a neat experience to just try
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and if you get paid that's an added bonus
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's such a bad name for a job position
sounds violent
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): take the shot, bill
Bill: oof that was bad.
Bill: soooo many work messages this morning holy fuck
Bill: Trends for second shooting...

Just shooting, no post. 👍 
Either 'be creative' or follow specific instructions for shots (the latter would suck but I can ask beforehand)
Be assistant for lead photog, which is okay I guess, but not my thing.
Take absolutely no credit for anything what so ever.
N🆗ri (Marisa): so it's an internship
Bill: aaaaah work soooo annoyyyyyinggggg todayyyyy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh gosh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ..........yikes
N🆗ri (Marisa): There aren’t even 15 canon variations <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Can she really do the voice?
Bill: ~~rwby is big on non canon variant cosplay~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no she cant
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but she thinks she can
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and its honestly the most annoying thing about her
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the rest of her i can just pass off as social awkwardness and attention seeking
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but the fact that she like REALLY thinks she can do nora's voice....and cant
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and she screams a lot as nora
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yikes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like..... please be quieter
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nora doesn’t scream there’s a difference between being loud and screaming
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): her nora voice is..... not even close to canon
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and she just ..yells to compensate
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just hate the IRL Nora schtick
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same
Bill: She annoying.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The only canon cosplayers are characters modeled after real people like Nabeshin <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): People saying they’re “IRL [cosplay]”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OOF
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s just kinda elitist
Bill: Mangoloo too?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “I’m the real version of Nora” like w h a t she’s fictional my friend
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea it comes off as "im better than all other x cosplayers"
Aldus Larian (Jess): like no you aint
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Casey never claims to be irl ruby at least
Bill: True. I know she gets the comment occasionally, but she doesn't *constantly scream it*.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the difference is that people tell casey shes canon ruby, casey doesnt say it herself
Bill: ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): brittanie says it herself....constantly
Bill: Mmkay.
Bill: Cause I don't find Casey annoying.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also Casey's been super branching out from Ruby
Bill: Brittanie is annoying as fuck.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea
Bill: lol Casey is just doing her monster swimsuits, Ruby, and Cammie. That it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): caseys fame was stummbled unpon, britnie is trying to make her own
Bill: Oh actually borderlands.
Bill: Yeah, Brittnie fake as fuck.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah Brit's Nora voice just sounds like she's super congested
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ITS LIKE SHE CLOSES OFF HER NOSE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and talks from her throat
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ad like
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there was like one video she did where she almost sounded kind of vaguely Nora-esque
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOAD

Aldus Larian (Jess): self dubbed
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh nooooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/ok-okay-gif-5850917

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): FULL STOP
Bill: RtX sUcKs
N🆗ri (Marisa): I remember the episode where Nora randomly starts opera singing. Totally.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she sings opera, has Weiss so naturally she's also IRL Weiss
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O O F
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dont even say that erik she might hear you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /adds to bio “also irl Weiss”

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): woah
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): galaxy brain
Aldus Larian (Jess): if shes canon nora does that mean shes an orphan too?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like if you have to say you’re irl whatever then clearly you’re not
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OMG
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _can she also jump 100 feet in the air_
Bill: Yeah those characters are sisters and he drew them older/younger but the body types are too different.
Aldus Larian (Jess): does he eat floor bread?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so.... if lightning were to strike her.....
Bill: *lets find out*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Poor Stephen too, he clearly likes cosplaying Neptune and got roped into Ren I think

N🆗ri (Marisa): Crisis mode activated
N🆗ri (Marisa): all this rwby talk makes me wanna finally restyle my wig
N🆗ri (Marisa): And escape from whatever spawned Nora/Neptune 
Is it because they both have N at the beginning
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh gosh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Everyone on social media being a dumb today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This person I follow literally asks for money every day
Bill: so they're not dumb today, they're just dumb.
Bill: Why do I recognize that name?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh

I don’t see how people can ask for money like that it comes off as so entitled or shameless
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They cosplay Nora

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have a hunch that they’re paid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Who's Pike and why is she the IRL version of them?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Critical role I believe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *79 posts*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): definitely paid
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Her posts get 1K likes but they’re all mostly from the same angle and I think she pays for those too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You’ve seen same face syndrome now look at same pose syndrome!
Bill: Oh her account looks like Lulu's. all selfies.
Aldus Larian (Jess): pretty sure new office mate just punched his desk twice and then wen to lunch?
Bill: WOW what a mood.
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s training for the battle
Aldus Larian (Jess): like damn boi i know this job is bullshit but plz

Aldus Larian (Jess): more likely #dumbboss but ye
Bill: Both valid.
Bill: I basically got to tell an annoying client “you need to stop messaging me, you have to contact this person with your big requests going forward”.
Bill: That was fun.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh boi I. Late to the Nora bashing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Well.. Brit bashing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same thing tho rite?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): What's amusing is I hate Nora's actual voice too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they both bad
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMaO
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao, i did nora impressions tom would murder me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we all would
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we love you, but oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): her voice is like 😬
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its so annoying
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its why i tend to not like nora.... but like its really just her voice that annoys me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): her as a character isnt bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): its so shrill
Aldus Larian (Jess): completely understandable have a nice day
Elfriede Faun (Tom): If Nora had a better voice she'd prob be my favorite
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Simalar reason I was resistant to like ruby
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh valid
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But Nora's is worse
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea it is
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes so cute though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like why
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahhh,
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I remember ep 1 the first.time Ruby spoke I was immediately like ..oh no.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same with Adam actually in the Blake trailer
Bill: Ruby’s voice has gotten tamer over the course of the show.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The voice actors have gotten better I think, at least ruby and Adams but Nora's... It's the valley girl thing and the felceto while singing (if that's how you write it)
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaaa noras voice is always the worst liek no matter what
Elfriede Faun (Tom): (Adam past tense lmao)
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but ruby still has an annoying voice too xD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh yeah for sure yo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Out of team rwby I think Weiss has the best voice performance
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i agree
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): blake i think is second, then yang, then ruby
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I agree 👌
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): barb has gotten better tho but it used to just sound like barb yelling xD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahhhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Out of jnpr
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh.. god
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They all suck
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEa
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Jaune probably
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nora is Nora, Ren doesn't even have lines
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pyrrha sounds...
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oof
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i hate noras voice so much that ill always put her on bottom but pyrrha is pretty bad too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like not annoying, but just.. not good VAing
Bill: Jaune JUST because he has more lines.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oz has a good VA I think
Bill: Yeaaaah I like Oz.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea
Bill: I haven’t watched any rwby in awhile. Binge watch when.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's funny because I don't know who any of the voice actors actually are
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cep VIC
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i only know the main 4
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and vic
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): unfortunately
Bill: I don’t pay attention to voice actors cause they were always Japanese and I couldn’t care less.
N🆗ri (Marisa): do you think ruby and sun sound different after they had their kid?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://youtu.be/88bfah_cFy4?t=54
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I liked Ruby's V1 voice better. It's gotten so much higher pitched
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): agreed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it was still annoying
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its worse higher pitched
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh man Sun and Ruby.. wack
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): was Sun's different? I never noticed. It just sounds like less angry Michael
Bill: *passive aggressive Facebook posts aren’t professional my guy*
Bill: *Wait no one tell Hunter*
Bill: oops I'm crashing guess that super coffee from this morning wore off.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Probs
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof. New office mate beats his head on the desk when he's frustrated
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): uhhhhhhhhhh
Bill: ,... That's a bit excessive.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NOOOOO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Not one of those
N🆗ri (Marisa): so metal
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Abort abort
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:huh:555585958146473984>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Please save me
Elfriede Faun (Tom): God noooooooo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I was friends with someone who did that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He also pulled his hair
Aldus Larian (Jess): I've never seen an adult do it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah exactly
Bill: Like... that's not healthy...
Bill: Less brain cells aren't going to make the work easier guy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is he autistic
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like yesterday I told him "sometimes I'll take to myself if I'm trying to figure something out so just ignore me"
And he was like "oh yea sometimes I beat my head of the desk"
Aldus Larian (Jess): But today he actually did it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I thought he was kidding
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh wow
Aldus Larian (Jess): Doesn't seem to be
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh man at least he knows
Aldus Larian (Jess): He seems normal besides that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think the kid I was friends with was tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hope hes like... emotionally ok
Bill: ye that's a bit extreme my guy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its an autistic trait usually, or a form of self harm
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so im kinda concerned
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I would automatically assume autistic
Bill: ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): At least I know he doesn't own a gun. Unlike Howard who pictures people's faces he doesn't like when he does target practice
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea me too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But Ive never met him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh god
Bill: *How's freelance looking now lol*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Anyway meeting time
N🆗ri (Marisa): have fun don't forget to call and don't stay out too late
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean he functions normally in the office bsides that so I haven't really seem anything else to suggest autism?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe he just thinks it's hardcore
Bill: Could be very high functioning.
Bill: ~~I'd assume he'd have to be for you boss to hire him, he seems the type to ignore equal opportunity laws~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ESCUSE
Aldus Larian (Jess): My boss hired me
Bill: *and does he treat you roght*
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't think I'm getting what you're saying here....
Aldus Larian (Jess): Def doesn't care about equal opportunity he won't even hire black people
Bill: Pretty sure the guy who says “women get hysterical too quickly” when you suggest something to him is also the kind of guy who would refuse to hire someone with autism.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo ok yea I read that wrong
Bill: So if your office mate is, he must be high enough functioning your boss didn’t realize.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I thought you meant "must be autistic"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Anyway actually meeting now bye
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or not
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa this has definitely become an ear infection, everytime I talk my ear hurts/itches. Good times
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof I'm sorry Jess. Ear infections suck. Hopefully it gets better soon
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thank I made an appointment for tomorrow night cuz I think I need antibiotics
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah. I used to get them as a kid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Had these pink chewy tablet things
Aldus Larian (Jess): A good time ™
Aldus Larian (Jess): I called the doctor and told them I was a new patient and gave them my name and they were like "oh you're not new you were like 10+ years ago" <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
