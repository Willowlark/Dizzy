Aldus Larian (Jess): I actually mean a staycation
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz I have so much to do in this house
Bill: Ooooh lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just I'm so tired after I get home from work, and I'm busy both days of almost every weekend. I just need a few days to catch up on stiff around the house but it's so hard cuz I need all my days for cons
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like yesterday Tom and I spent miuch needed quality time together but today I got nothing done cuz I just needed to chill and the tomorrow I'm busy with family and I'm just stressed cuz maintaining this whole house is hard on a full time schedule 😭

Aldus Larian (Jess): Or energy
Bill: I need to spend tomorrow getting my desk clear again but it’s just so hard to want to. I wanna get rid of the hutch too and figuring out how to do that is mentally draining.
Bill: I feel you SO much.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea. Now imagine a whole house. Like I don't wanna whine cuz having this whole house is amazing but it's alot to clean, organize and keep up with
Bill: Yeaaaah. I get you.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i been feeling that way too jess
Bill: I wasn’t too bad with the apartment, but it’s because I mostly lived in one room.
Bill: Living room was pretty easy to keep neat cause I only watched tv there.
Bill: Mecurio’s house is kinda a mess too like.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Living room isn't hard, every cabinet, clost and draw needs to be reorganized
Bill: Oof.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The yard looks like shit, the garage looks like shit the basements a mess
Bill: Every basement is a mess tbh
Aldus Larian (Jess): Doesn't matter I don't like it the way it is so it still stresses me
Bill: Oh ye. Not saying that as a who cares just like. Everyone’s feeling that mood.
Bill: It’s not spring enough to motivate spring cleaning damnit.
Bill: Give me consistently nice weather.

Bill: Woo!
Bill: Do you have a lot of places to go for Easter like Christmas?

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Umaru is a glorious child
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That nsfw holiday block of text thing is getting really old
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And in really poor taste for Easter
Bill: It was old when he shared it here for the first time.
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/13010904/android/sticker.png;compress=true
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's the mood
Aldus Larian (Jess): I find them entertaining sometimes hit yea that ines offense af
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It was funny for like, Halloween and 4th of July
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's funny like... once
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Now it's just the same thing over and over again, at inappropriate times
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea for non religious holidays it's fine. I would even find it less offensive if it just focused on like the Easter bunny only but like 😣
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hal: ~does something offensive~
Everyone: That was offensive
Hal: <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: He’s probably just running on “it was funny last time so it’s funny now”
Bill: Or he’s a raunchy guy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): More like Hal: *does something offensive and then doesn't come back to the server for another 3 days so has no idea it was even offensive*
Bill: Also true.
Bill: What a loon that one.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then writes a big 5 page essay apologizing
Aldus Larian (Jess): At 3 in the morning
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): To which no one will respond for another day
Bill: I throw him a bone before it gets to that these days...
Bill: If he's putting himself out and apologizing, it better to reward the good behavior than ignore it and leave him further upset.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): This brings up something I should say, I grew up in an abusive household where religion was used solely to punish me.

 I'm working on being very accepting of other peoples religions even if,I ,myself dont participate due to personal reasons. But, if I ever say anything that might be offensive to you or anyone please let me know because I'm trying to better myself and correct any residue bad learned behaviors! C:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm really sorry you grew up in a situation like that. Religion should never be a means of punishing :(
Bill: Aww don’t worry. You’ve never said anything to offend me, I promise that. It’s a personal thing to everyone, anyone using it for terrible purposes like your experiences, or just people who are *pushy* with their beliefs are the one warping things.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But thank you for letting us know. I try not to like, overly push my religion because I understand it's not for everyone
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm sorry to hear that :( I will let you know if I notice anything. It's completely understandable why alot of people are against religion so I try to give people alot of leeway with it.
Bill: Oh ye you’ve never done anything pushy imo Erik.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea, none of you have xD yall are great. I just wanna make sure I'm being respectful and I always take constructive criticism of any bad behavior I might let out. 

Unlearning conditioned and learned behaviors is hard without help xD so ye, please let me know IF I ever do anything offensive.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 💕
Bill: Course. I gotta return the favor for some *brutal honesty* :pew
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Thank you! <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah you're fine, props on be self aware enough to realise you may be prone to that sort of thing 👌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hal: Thought I'd just pass it on like the others 🤷
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😒
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🤷
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😣
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hal: Let me know if I ever do something to upset anyone. I'm trying to better myself
Someone: This was inappropriate to post
Hal: 🤷
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg I missed the hal drag session
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _damn_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh gosh I actually read that now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That would’ve been maybe tolerable if it was just eggs and bunnies but the holy dick part is uhhhhh UHHHHH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Love that shrug emoji response
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The "holy dick" and "Jesus is cumming" parts are what really struck a nerve
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This is kinda counter productive that he’s like “tell me if I offend you” and then just shrugs
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea that's the part where I was like "hay, can we not?"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bunnies fucking joke: overdone but acceptable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bringing in religious figures inappropriately: that’s a no no
Bill: Oh good my parents think I’m so drunk I’m making up words. Coherency is in fact a word and you can fuck off thanks.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow i can't believe you're so drunk and incoherent to the point you're making up words like coherency
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo says there was a time in high school when i went to therapy every week for 3 days a week for over a year but i don't remember ***any*** of it 🤔 
i don't remember going, or the office, or the woman she described or anything and that's freaky
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no 😔 maybe you blocked it out
