Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): RWBY OC dude from Zenkai
Bill: The one who gave his life story about how the rwby shoot helped his depression and his moms death and so on
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): YESSS
Bill: Hahaha I bet you would.
Bill: The friend of that girl I knew at Rowan for a bit that I shot at GSCF.
Nokri (Marisa): what happen :0
Bill: That's it?
Bill: I haven't gotten to his photos cause I have a backlog ~~and have limited motivation for photos~~ and I ain't giving him raw files.
Nokri (Marisa): o
Bill: I had some motivation this morning to edit though and I should. DO IT.
Bill: ~~I was going to do all the non friend ones first to avoid these awkward scenarios but now I'm too salty to actually do his~~
Bill: There are too many photos from Next am intimidated.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ooo chocowaffo again
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Lol...
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I would care... except shes throwing around the word bullying so much that it's become a joke.... and refused to reveal who drew porn of her
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Shes protecting someone who is potentially a predator.... because she doesnt want to be seen as a "bully"
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea ok
Nokri (Marisa): omg someone drew porn of her? That‚Äôs super messed up

It‚Äôs not just porn of Nora is it
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Its nora
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And weiss
Nokri (Marisa): Then
That‚Äôs not her <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
It‚Äôs still messed up but it ain‚Äôt her
Yikes
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Like its definitely a "parody" of her specifically because it's in the location she was in in her cosplay photos and the nora has the exact shirt she made herself
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Like its definitely supposed to be her
Nokri (Marisa): Ouch
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But shes protecting the person
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Backhanded appreciation for her following
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I really.... hate her lmao....
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Shes infantilizing herself and making people baby her
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And throwing around the word " bullying" every time she speaks
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Like ok, its its obviously fucked up that someone drew porn
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Of her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Where did you see the art?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But for her to protect them
Kaio Vermino (Lee): On twitter
Kaio Vermino (Lee): She made a post with the art
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And blocked out the artists name
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And in the comments is acting like a literal child
Kaio Vermino (Lee): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yikes

Kaio Vermino (Lee): ...... <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Big mood
Bill: All she wants is attention. In her world she can milk this for more of it, so why not.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Of course
Kaio Vermino (Lee): It's just so... annoying
Bill: She‚Äôs got like, a fetish for being a victim.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't even follow her Twitter and I muted her IG stories
Kaio Vermino (Lee): All the people in the comments treating her like a baby
Bill: Well, the biggest way to stick it to her is to unfollow/ignore her.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Shes 25 years old and should be able to handle things like an adult
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh yea I unfollowed
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And am not touching this situation with a ten foot pole
Bill: I mean, it‚Äôs pretty fucked up.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): It is. But the way it's being handled is too
Bill: ,... unless... she made the whole thing... up. 

I hate that I had the thought, and that I. Believe it could happen.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ... no wish messaged me the exact same thing
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Theres no reason for her not to reveal the artist
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I want to believe shes not THAT desperate for attention though
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And that this is a real situation that shes just too immature to deal with as an adult
Bill: Especially if she heard about the fanfic porn about Casey. Whose... her idol and I wouldn‚Äôt past her to want to have this ‚Äúcrime‚Äù against her.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): .... ugh gross... good point
Nokri (Marisa): Does she draw? Does that art look similar@to anything she‚Äôs posted before
Bill: I thought about trying to find it but.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ... I feel like I've seen art similar to that before but ifk if it was hers
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But idk if I care enough to check lol
Bill: That‚Äôd be giving her attention and that‚Äôs what she wants.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ^
Bill: Besides, I don‚Äôt want to find out if she‚Äôs that fucked up.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Biiiiig mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Someone else found the art and brought it to her attention
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also would not reveal who it was
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: That humble brag.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Bill: Soon as you go south of DC the rwby community is batshit.
Nokri (Marisa): That means Otakon will be fun yay
Bill: I dunno how many of them are going.
Bill: I don't follow anyone outside of Casey and Jake.
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs the second biggest convention in North America so presumably a few
Nokri (Marisa): There are a lot of people who like rwby south of DV
Nokri (Marisa): Including the creators of rwby themselves eyyy
Bill: I'm thinking of specific people.
Nokri (Marisa): O
Bill: HA
Bill: Fittingly, Ethan is now a southern RWBY cosplayer.
Bill: He has been placed on the correct side of the batshit line.
