Aldus Larian (Jess): Ain't gonna lie I feel like a waste of space right now. I did do yard work today but after I finished all I did was sit on the couch, watch TV and eat enough carbs to feed a small nation. My periods completely knocking me.out and I've almost fell asleep multiple times today
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but at least you did yard work! that's an accomplishment! you deserved to be lazy the rest of the day! and you get a pass because periods suck.
