Kaio Vermino (Leanna): NOPE BIG MISTAKE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my tattoos are dark so like unless i wear another shirt underneath you can kind of see them through the shirt. and like even if people cant see my bra or anything ....its weird and uncomfortable to think they can look THROUGH my shirt to see my tattoos

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ive just been internally screaming since then
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thank god my day is almost over
N🆗ri (Marisa): We got BoJo a new phone and watched it being delivered, the box was cut open in transit and is empty <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omfg??????
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ahhh I don’t think there’s anything we can do about it. We called and they basically went “oh well” but it’s taken us like two years to save up for her phone.
N🆗ri (Marisa): If anyone can do anything about it it’s my sister in law
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): What company?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sprint, it was an iPhone 7
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's bullshit they've gotta be able to do something. 
What company delivered it?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Whatever company delivered it you need to contact
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They can't just say "oh well" and you're out of your money. Also contact the seller
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They need to send a replacement or a refund
N🆗ri (Marisa): USPS I think? Or UPS? One of them. I was helping my sister with dinner inside, my mother and sister in law were outside walking the kids and that’s how they saw it being delivered but weren’t able to get a picture because they didn’t think anything was amiss, until they picked it up and thought “wow this is light”
N🆗ri (Marisa): We’ve called Sprint, the woman had a super strong accent so it was really hard to understand what she was saying and she wouldn’t transfer us, basically saying nothing could be done
Aldus Larian (Jess): You should be a letter to see what company delivered it with the tracking info
N🆗ri (Marisa): They know who delivered it, just not *who* like the truck and the person
Aldus Larian (Jess): That doesn't matter. Shipping companies have insurance to cover that sort of thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah but there’s no proof we weren’t the ones who opened the package
N🆗ri (Marisa): My sister in law is very stubborn she’s been on the phone since she came in, if anything can possibly be done she’ll figure it out
N🆗ri (Marisa): Even my sister was like “my wife will handle this”
Aldus Larian (Jess): There has to be something. I hope she can get it straightened out.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WOWW
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah it'll be fixed
N🆗ri (Marisa): They’re telling us to file a police report and then call back with the report number, which might take two days to get
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :/
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTF 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): We called the cops and our cousin showed up lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): He was very annoyed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Omg
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Delivery company says they can’t do anything, the request has to come from Sprint
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Did you contact Sprint yet?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yep that was the first place we contacted, we’ve called back three times so far
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rutgers has a carnival going on and I feel bad cause I did so much better than Noah at all the throwing games and stuff
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like every booth
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): His poor masculinity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I got this squish boi as a prize tho
