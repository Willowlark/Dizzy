Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ugh my computer is running slow today. today's not going to be great
Bill: Both eyes pretty swol and dry now. I look like some kinda addict. Going to see if I can get an appointment at my old optometrist instead of Hershfield since he basically said "it dry, take these drops and yeet" both times I brought this to him.
Glonk: Have you made a doctor's appointment since your er visit
Bill: ya. Saw GP on Saturday morning, Mom's going to the cardiologist this morning for a stress test so she's making me and Dad appointments when she's there. Eyes are more than likely a different thing lol, I've had this happen in the right eye twice recently. Whatever Hershfield gave ain't killing it.
Bill: That eyes on drugs meme but it’s fire emblem.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You actual eye balls looks fine to me
Bill: is more the lids and such.
Nokri (Marisa): at least I was able to finish Carole and Tuesday before the Netflix got shut off ;u;
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nuuuuu
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just passive aggressively made an assembly procedure for a product that's literally a wire that is stripped on both ends
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because my boss thinks we need one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Step 1: cut and strip wire per customer drawing
Step 2: Submit to QA for inspection
El🆓de Faun (Tom): We have assembly instructions exactly like that too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We finally finished our meeting. One of our common CAs usually involves internal audits not getting done. We have three people trained to do it, but it's not our immediate priority because it's me, our customer service person, and our purchasing person and we all have other things that we need to do
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Our solution for conducting our internal audits is to hire an external auditor to do our internal audits
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Potentially from the same company that conducts our annual external audit
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh. ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): my coworker doesnt know how to put something on a flash drive...
Aldus Larian (Jess): im sorry but WHAT you are 23, how do you not know how to do that?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ...excuse me?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): how
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have no idea!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"How do you turn the bluetooth on? What do you mean I have to plug it in?"*
Nokri (Marisa): oooh. that maintenance worker who took time off for mental reasons died. i don't know yet if it was suicide or unrelated reasons but ouch.
Nokri (Marisa): they're saying it sounds like suicide
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oh shit
Kaio Vermino (Lee): :/
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :(((
Nokri (Marisa): BoJo is kind of devastated because she made him promise to call her if he was going to anything
Nokri (Marisa): She cancelled work for the rest of the day and the evening classes we have
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Noooooo 😭
Nokri (Marisa): I spent so long thinking I broke the bathtub and clogged up the drain, I used so much drain cleaner and the snake thing. The water wouldn’t drain no matter what I was freaking out. 

Turns out the bucket just flipped the little “dont drain” flip up when someone filled it up to flush the toilet. I just had to flip it down again. Crisis averted. <:rise:582318089228648456>
