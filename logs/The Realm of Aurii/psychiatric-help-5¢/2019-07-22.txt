Nokri (Marisa): im sad now
Bill: y?
Nokri (Marisa): sbbb stuff. i knew it'd happen, but the person who did it is a real jerk.
Nokri (Marisa): or rather is being a jerk about it
Bill: in game jerk, out out of game jerK?
Nokri (Marisa): it's a bit of both
Nokri (Marisa): the game and reality are connected
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My students were such jerks at study hall
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :(
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How dare they
Nokri (Marisa): the police gave me headphones I feel a little less sad
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Good!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Are they at least beats by Dre?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ice actually been productive this first hour 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hopefully I can keep it up
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Woo!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because I came in to two more quotes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): One of which was just different quantities of one we did last week so that was quick to get out of the way
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooooh I see what chocowaffo was talking about
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Big pics in the nsfw chat even tho they censored
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Alright the bullying thing I didn’t quite believe but this is pretty upsetting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmmm don’t like that
Nokri (Marisa): yowza
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~that's not how fundraisers should work~~
Nokri (Marisa): one of the people who booked a shoot with me at ota wants to extend it to an hour
and i think i have time for it. i might miss a panel i really wanted to see if it fills up, but i can make more money so i guess it's ok.

I wrote on my ad that it's $15 per half hour, and she wanted to know how much extending 30 minutes to an hour would cost. i already feel like it's a lot of money and i feel really bad if i were to charge $30 for an hour, but my therapist got upset with me for charging so "little". i want to give her a discount for an hour but should i stick to $30 for an hour?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ya $30 for an hour
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Agreed, $30/hr is good
Nokri (Marisa): it's not too much? it seems like a lot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's not too much
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's a very reasonable price to ask
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Good
Nokri (Marisa): for professionals probably but hhhhhhhhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How many photos are you planning on giving back to her?
Nokri (Marisa): as many as i can
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then yeah, go with $30
Nokri (Marisa): hhhhhhhhhhh
jess how long did we shoot for at katsu? was that a half hour or closer to an hour
Bill: You definitely can charge 30 for an hour.
Aldus Larian (Jess): it was prob around an hour?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Marisa, $30 for an hour of shooting, plus however much time you spend editing "as many as you can" is not an unreasonable amount to charge for your time and talent
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You do good work. Don't under sell yourself 💕
Nokri (Marisa): ain't got no talent though that's the thing
i just want people to be happy but i also don't want to die and have our house keep degrading because we don't have money
so i guess i could tell her $30 and hope she isn't mad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, I wanted to shoot with you at some point too but I don't think I formally scheduled anything. Do you still have any availability?
Nokri (Marisa): ye! i've got saturday evening and most of sunday
Nokri (Marisa): for u is free
Nokri (Marisa): aurii is free
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can I donate money or buy you a merch/art instead? :3c
Nokri (Marisa): nah <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): i probably won't be able to do a costume chance on friday until like. 6pm or 8:30pm. kagura's gonna get a lot of wear ahhh
Nokri (Marisa): She said $30 might be too much and she’s not sure if she’s getting paid so it’ll be a “maybe” ;u;
Nokri (Marisa): sorry Madoka cosplayer hhh
Bill: Stick to your guns. 💪
Bill: What happened with moving your Yona shoot?
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah I can’t change the price now that I’ve told her but I feel so guilty
Yeah that’ll have to be moved sorry
Bill: To when?
Nokri (Marisa): if you still wanted to do it, the only time i have free before sunset is 5:30 or 7:30 ;u;
unless i don't get into a certain event, then i could do it any time between 4:30 and 6
Nokri (Marisa): unless i change into yona early in the morning
Bill: I already have commitments during those those timeframes. 😭
Nokri (Marisa): i could do blake until 11 and change and go to nano and then ooo sowwy it a no-go then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I got my 6 pm Mawisa spot 😎👉
Nokri (Marisa): geowgia would you be able to take a picture or two of my yona?
Nokri (Marisa): i would be forever in debt
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I can take pic!
Bill: I might be able to do morning, just not past 4:30.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I took pics of bill this weekend and they weren’t trash
Nokri (Marisa): a lot of my schedule is dependant on how popular something is, so i might have time if something is so popular i don't get in it
or i'd have about 15 minutes to shoot yona if i change early enough
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can I do a Saturday evening Marisa spot? :3
Bill: we'll play it by ear then, if you text me I can see what I'm doing at the time.
Nokri (Marisa): ye!!
let me post my schedule so you can pick a time
Nokri (Marisa): anything in white, though i'm gonna try and change into yona before georgia's shoot so i can at least wear her if i haven't changed out of blake by then
Nokri (Marisa): ooo right there are two trigger autograph sessions
but with how popular they are i doubt i'll get into either session
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can I do 8?
Nokri (Marisa): Ye! That’ll be right at sunset 🌇
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That'll be cool for Kiri photos
Nokri (Marisa): punch the sun
Bill: I think you have more shoots than I do. 😮
Nokri (Marisa): 🔫
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wanna know what the colors means
Nokri (Marisa): Blue is stuff I wanna do, red is paid shoots, yellow is free shoots (or the rwby meetup I’m helping with), the orange/pale red is a paid shoot that’s been paid for already
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh you should switch mine to red <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760> nah that’d go against the laws of the colors
Aldus Larian (Jess): change da law
Nokri (Marisa): That’s illegal
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah! is progress!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mine should be red too 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): Naw don’t worry is also yellow
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): holy shit today is speeding along
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 40 minutes until lunch hell yeah
Bill: Same here.
Bill: Mawisa if me and Jess do V^2 you should get some meme photos for us. *Put it down as an extra red shoot.*
Nokri (Marisa): A green shoot. I pay u guys to let me take pics of u
Bill: No no no.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo i dont know what time yet tho! i wouldnt want mawisa to set aside time and then we be a weiner and and end up not doing him
Bill: That's what I gotta pay you for Chise photo.
Bill: Me either.
Nokri (Marisa): I pay y’all for the privilege of even thinking about shooting u
Bill: ~~if we have the move/cancel we can just pay Marisa for being perfect~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh good point
Bill: right?
Nokri (Marisa): left
Aldus Larian (Jess): i prob just use V as my pocket "I wanna change to be more comfy" cosplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): pocket V
Bill: When would the best time friday for you Mawisa? I'm guessing 6, since that gives you a half hour buffer getting to the game show still? I should consider getting some photos of Barry, even if it's a solo thing.
Nokri (Marisa): Oo for V shoot? I was gonna change at 6, is a night shoot ok?
Bill: Nah, Barry Burton RE.
Nokri (Marisa): I could do 6 potentially
Nokri (Marisa): Oo
Bill: I could do 5, but I don't want you to miss your panel.
Nokri (Marisa): Ye trigger is popular, 5 was going to be dinner while waiting in line
If Madoka doesn’t want to extend her shoot to an hour I could do 4:30
Nokri (Marisa): She’s on the fence about it
Nokri (Marisa): Gameshow will probably have many seats I can do 6. I’ll just hope Kagura isn’t a sweaty mess
Nokri (Marisa): Oh wait shoot the trigger panel is likely an hour long my bad
Nokri (Marisa): 6:30
Nokri (Marisa): I have to check the schedule again aaa
Bill: Let it rest on Madoka. It not sooper important to get pictures for this cosplay and maybe Jess’ll do em.
Nokri (Marisa): I have failed yooouuu
Bill: Nope. With a popped P.
Bill: I’d never forgive myself if you missed a panel for me.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It took me a while to realize you meant you were saying "nope" in a way that the P makes a popping sound
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And didn't mean "with a popped pussy"
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **Watthefuck**
Bill: Uh?
Bill: Never heard that one before.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m with you Erik LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof how do I tell heather I’m having a thing but I’m keeping it small ahhhhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s really nice and got me a cute gift last year but I just do not have it in me for more than 15 people
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😬
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i guess just be honest?
Bill: “Too busy prepping for my internship to host a big party”
Nokri (Marisa): What if she’s planning a surprise party
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Followers that feel the need to send a follow up message if you don’t answer fast enough 🙃
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Bill: ~~I do that with friends sometimes...!~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk 3 hours is a little fast
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like especially on a week work day
Bill: ~~followers aren't entitled to any response~~
Bill: I have been complimented by strangers a few times recently. If it was just Saturday I'd chalk it up to nice outfit, but I've been complimented on battered tee turtle shirts (which I guess is a compliment on the shirt rather than myself, but that could apply to everything) a few times too. I wonder why. Different air about me or something?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you seemed happier on saturday than youve seemed in the chat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): granted thats also online v. in-person presence
Bill: That's also a pretty easy scenario to be happy in, all things considered.
Bill: It's just been weird.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I went home on lunch to shut the windows at home and its pouring so hard out. my pants and shoes are soaked and i couldnt even see the rd ont he way back to work
Bill: Oh yeah it's insane here too.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :(
