Bill: Never been so thankful to be at work; this entire three hour drive my depression has been on overdrive and I’m so, so drained.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's also just been straight darkness for like 3 says straight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof I'm sorry Bill. Hopefully work can distract your depression
Bill: I wish it was just the weather. 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah... I'm sure it don't help tho
Bill: I’m not sure but the getting sick doesn’t seem to helping. I should have turned around after 45 minutes on route 80.
Bill: Route 80 between exit 25 and 35.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof ethan texted me asking if running the RWBY shoot is a bad idea because of chocowaffo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao why does he care?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's very unlike him
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea he's usually like "fuck everyone idc"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He says he doesn’t want drama?
Nokri (Marisa): i'm sorry to do this today, i don't want to put a sour mood on jess day so you can ignore this if you want. but i want to get it out of the way while i'm reasonably rational. sorry to butt into the ethan drama, you can ignore this again. i don't want to create drama but i know this will come across as dramatic and i'm starting to ramble.

i've had a major psychotic break and have been experiencing continuous psychosis. i'm constantly scared, paranoid, anxious, and crying. which is nothing new but this is for days in a row without relent. when i haven't been working at home for the last however many days it is (i can't even tell anymore, i can't keep track of time, i only know what it currently is) i've been in and out of various doctors getting blood tests and scans that require me to not eat for long periods of time. i constantly feel sick and my head hurts and my chest hurts and i want it to end so badly. i sometimes get little rational breaks where things are somewhat calm like right now but they don't last long.
Nokri (Marisa): i don't want pity or condolences. i've been avoiding aurii because of paranoia that you all hate me, that you talk behind my back and make fun of me and that i'm a useless annoying sack of shit. yeah i'm rude now. i know that's not true, you could've kicked me out at any time and you still can. i value all of your opinions and feelings to the extreme on an unhealthy level because i see you all as far above what i could ever hope to be as a human being. i don't want people to be sorry for me. i don't know if after i type this you're all going to go into another chat and talk about what trash i am. i don't think you're the type of people that would do that but i'm so paranoid and scared and anxious anymore that it's hard to discern reality from what's in my own head. i know what's wrong and i know what's fake but it all seems so real and i can't get it to stop or go away. i'm sorry for writing this and i'm sorry for being like this i don't know what to do and there are so many tests and they're so expensive and i'm melting down again i'm sorry. this is a mess and i know it's insulting to you guys and i'm sorry. i don't mean to be this way.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s okay Mawisa, we understand you’re going through a tough time, but we love and support you irregardless!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We love and hang out with you because we want to, and because you’re a kind friend and a great person!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Marisa, I really don't know the best way to respond but we do love you and we don't talk about you behind your back. I know your brain doesn't let you believe that but I really hope you are ablet o get the help you need and get better. We all love you and are all here for you ❤
Aldus Larian (Jess): Let me start by saying that the only time we talk about you "behind your back" is basically just saying saying how we lobe you, think you're cool, or wish you could see how great you are. There's no reason to appologize although I know you need to, in which case, it's perfectly fine we're all here for you and we love you. I hope all these tests can help you get some answers ❤️
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sorry about all the commas I have an addiction
Nokri (Marisa): and now he’s here I don’t know what he’s doing here oh god
Aldus Larian (Jess): Who?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ditto what everyone else said 🙏 I won't broken record it, we love you.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also I'm guessing Father's day?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Unfortunately
Nokri (Marisa): i think he left medical card copies in the door and walked away but i was so scared i got sick. i'm a little more lucid now. i'm not going to check the door, but i got him on tape so i know he was real.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's ok! I'm sure that was the last thing you needed today 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm glad he left though
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Good he didn't come in yeah
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn sorry you got sick 😷 :/
Bill: Marisa we love you. I know you can’t believe it it but I swear it. We’re here to listen whenever you need, and we’ll still be here while you adjust. We love you just as you are, you are worthy of us, and for everything you’ll become. ❤️❤️❤️
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): For every one (1) task I finish at work, three (3) more get added onto my list
Bill: I did the “what should I cosplay” going around but I ended up deleting it cause I didn’t want to deal with the sad that comes from no responses... but I can’t help till being curious if someone would have said something. Hazel came from that hot tub guy at CCE after all.
Nokri (Marisa): magical girl
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hawkeye so you can carry around a bow and arrow <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ....ghira?
Bill: ~~I can't handle how I look in a half length jacket, what am I going to do with a magic frilly skirt~~
Bill: lol you don't have to force yourselves to come up with stuff. I just can't help the curiousness.
Nokri (Marisa): magical girl snoop dogg
Bill: I don't smoke enough weed.
Nokri (Marisa): ***enough?***
Nokri (Marisa): would i be good at cosplaying anything
Nokri (Marisa): a sim
Bill: You're good at cosplaying lots of things.
Bill: You have moeblob types down pat, plus idols.
Nokri (Marisa): I’m really bad at idols
Nokri (Marisa): you should try
Bill: You aren't though? Your favorite pose is classic idol.
Nokri (Marisa): sticking hand out does not an idol make
my favorite pose is facedown on the ground so people only see the costume
Bill: You’ve never done that so can’t be your favorite.
Nokri (Marisa): i have
Nokri (Marisa): nice
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I think my favorite of Marisa's is Raven and Dani
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It is dani right 🤔
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'mma think in it for you Billiam
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I know I've tjight of characters in the past but I forget them atm
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wheres your Largo cosplay at
Bill: SNRK
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Tbh Levi would fit you well
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But you didn't watch SNK so
Bill: Snrk?
Bill: Snk?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): No-no just happened to be similar
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Shigeki no Kyoujin
Bill: Isn’t that a fighting game?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yes it is lmao but not what I meant
Bill: Sorry never saw the abbreviation via the Japanese title lol
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If I say it in the Japanese name it'll take you slightly longer to realize I meant Attack on Titan xD
Bill: Isn’t Levi the sharp eyed black hair dude?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He's op
El🆓de Faun (Tom): At least where I'm at he's the No1 scout
Bill: I don’t get the feelies but like you said I haven’t seen it lol.
Aldus Larian (Jess): His personality fits you
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He's actually pretty cool not gonna lie
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I thought about cosing himtoo
Bill: And to answer before, Hawkeye I’d do if I can square off my build more, and Ghira... catdad would be meme worthy but I don’t quite feel it.
Bill: Ngl afaik he’s kinda dick? Hardass pragmatist?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ghira or Levi?
Bill: Levi. Only from hear say tho.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He's really only hard on Eren lmao
Bill: Ooooh he the lancer maybe.
Bill: Cosplaying largo would require massive property damage.
Nokri (Marisa): I like that people are recommending the tallest people to cosplay the shortest character
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Marisa cosplay the collosal titan
Nokri (Marisa): i only have hanji's outfit and i'm several hundred meters too short
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I was reading the wiki and I spoiled something about potato girl <:lenny:395307171539189760>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oops

El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'll do it
Bill: Oof my guy.
Nokri (Marisa): tom will do it
Bill: I love you my guy but motivation for that hat’ll require girlfriend XD
Bill: I still need to cosplay a not villain from RWBY. I’ve only ever considered Hazel, Roman, and Cardin. Pilot boi doesn’t count.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There's men in rwby?
Bill: Jaune and Ren bout it. <:pew:543202259085950996>
