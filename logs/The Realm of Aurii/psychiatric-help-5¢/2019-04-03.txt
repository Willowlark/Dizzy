Bill: You know what’s a look I’m jealous of? Headlines around  neck. I can’t do it, doubt I could even losing weight.
Bill: It’s so convenient.
N🆗ri (Marisa): until there's a spider in the headphones and it crawls out onto your neck
Bill: Better my neck than my ear?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd pay for some spiders to eat my brain
Bill: And that’s why you’re the token furry.
N🆗ri (Marisa): are spiders furry
wouldn't that be vore
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just want my death to be helpful to the spiders <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Man Noah is awesome but I can’t keep pace with his healthy eating
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I got back from the gym and he’s like “I got you dinner, salad and steamed veggies!”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awwww
Aldus Larian (Jess): He cares about your health ♥️
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I just said “oh thanks...” took it back to my room and put it in the fridge to eat Mac and cheese
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'll take it
N🆗ri (Marisa): where the chocolate
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He does care but I dont eat veggies every meal like he does
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My parents let me grow up eating kinda whatever
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So my eating habits are a little trash
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I like carrots and spinach and lettuce
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I can’t stand tomatos or peas or stuff
Aldus Larian (Jess): My parents were very "you don't have to eat this, but if you don't you are on your own "
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I was always very unpicky
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _he tryin so hard and I feel bad but I just can’t be that healthy_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof I was always picky
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I’m like “oh ha maybe get some pasta next time” and he’s like “dawww you had carbs for lunch tho”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I’m like dammit man let me die by processed food
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof I would die, I feel you georgia
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I rarely eat veggies. I've been trying to do better but just.... ugh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he spends like two hours at the gym like yo I do an hour and call it good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _he too healthy_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's how he stays looking good for you tho <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TRUE I just can’t keep up oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he’s like “you don’t have to do as much as me just stay healthy”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Still Feels Bad Man™️
Bill: Sucks.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It probably gets easier the more you do it though and even you trying is great
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): Even a little bit is good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yaaaa it’s true
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk feels weird still
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah somehow does it all I’m just like how
N🆗ri (Marisa): secretly goat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean he sleeps 6 hours a night .-.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But it’s crazy seeing his schedule is perfect to just include working out, school, research, girlfriend, and that’s basically it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Makes me kiiiinda not envy him
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We need to introduce you to roasted vegetables. That's the good shit 👌🏻
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or *grilled* vegetables
Aldus Larian (Jess): Veggies are lit man
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Grilled green beans and asparagus are the shit
Aldus Larian (Jess): Grilled zuchinni 👌
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Not a huge fan of zucchini but I think it's because my brain thinks it looks like cucumber and then it's not and it's offputting lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo yea tgat would make sense
Elfriede Faun (Tom): veggies are lit fam
Elfriede Faun (Tom): remember we did that picky quiz?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): wanna do it again <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I lose, weee

Aldus Larian (Jess): Im the reigning champion
N🆗ri (Marisa): octopus so chewy
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NAH ME AND JESS WERE TIED

Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh shit were we damn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Actually veggies from hibachi are always good

Aldus Larian (Jess): Grilled
N🆗ri (Marisa): the power of japanese food
Bill: Both vegetables.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oops still forgot to answer hal
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im beyond caring anymore
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh well

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): welp, Mark was 100% right about him being autistic
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unfortunately I feel like alot of people who end up coming across as creepy at cons are autistic 😥
Bill: Maybe be dickish of me to say, but I don't think that means you have to hand hold them whenever they want to be friends though. It feels dickish, but it's not like I'm paying for a hotel and badge and so on to babysit someone with no social skills.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Alot of autistic people just want to be told what they are doing wrong. But that's hard to do cuz I don't want to offend them even though it's possible they wouldn't even take it that way
Bill: *Most* people don't take criticism well, it's a safe assumption to be polite and not say anything.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Georgia, if you choose to respond to that, you could probably just say something simple like "I'm glad you had fun at the shoot. Hope you have fun at the next one!" and just kind of leave it at that. Kind of defines a good end to the conversation
Bill: You can shut down a conversation by 1) not providing new information and 2) not asking questions.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And *if* he keeps pressing about his the bad things in his life, that would be a time to bring up that mentioning those sorts of things right off the bat are uncomfortable
Bill: ^
Bill: he is at least uncharacteristic in keeping mentioning your 'boyfriend'. It seems to usually be these guys don't acknowledge your 'SO' (so they can imagine you like them more than other people) unless you beat them over the head with it. (If you *did* that at Zenkai when I wasn't in earshot, I'm not offended and you can use that as an excuse for your perceived safety at any time)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): His name is David Simpson right?
Bill: yup.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): creeped on his profile. says he's in a relationship (and photo in his Insta seems to confirm that)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also beserker_byakko isn't even his cosplay account? so watch out for azure_storms55 as well
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *that's his OC's name fuck lol*
Bill: OOF
Bill: Maybe he created his oc when AIM was still a thing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😬
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): according to the tags on some of his posts seems like maybe he's part of a RWBY D&D campaign? He tags stuff with #rwbydnd
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He seems harmless. Just a bit annoying
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But still be wary, ya never know
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like Todoroki guy 😬
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok well maybe Todoroki guy is a bit more because I don't think Beserker came to say hi and butt in your conversations every time he saw you throughout the weekend...
Bill: *he want that bellabooty*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Except he always finds me when I'm in Taiyang*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): luckily ~~genderbent Nora~~ Bellabooty kid didn't bother me this year
Aldus Larian (Jess): he also needs a new tshirt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YES
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Unless he has like, 5 of them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I somehow doubt that
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i dont think so XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): its prob his only fandom tshirt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he doesn't even have any posts on his Instagram so he essentially he just scrolls through his feed of the 90 people he follows
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I'm going to let my story run dry outside of my close friends list for a while and then put the people who constantly respond to them on the hide stories list 😬
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): i only respond to friends and once in a while mutual's stories
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was adding more people to my close friends list and came across one of the more famous cosplayers in my suggestions and I was like *oh shit, she actually follows me?* O.o
Bill: Well, you are surprisingly popular for a male cosplayer.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I remember her liking like, one or two of my posts before. But of her 48.5k followers I'm one of the few she follows back which is kind of neat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not that she actively follows me or views my stories or anything
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I actually ended up muting her story because she's *one of those* that posts the same ads for her Patreon every. single. day.
Bill: ha. Yeaaaah.
Bill: Casey doesn't follow me, that's as famoose as I get.
Bill: Or not get.
Bill: oh, the weiss from Kotori tagged my facebook page (a rare occurence).
Bill: Is apparently going to geekdom?
Bill: iirc peachy (the weiss) posted something super sketch to her story and I was like 'oh okay you're weird'. I think it was kinda anti LGBTQ? Not sure anymore. The Ruby was cute. *And married*.
Bill: mahahahaaaaa It worked.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ?
Bill: Rebecca.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ah
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hhhhhhhhhh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): there was an awkward part of zenkai at the marvel shoot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): snow was like...attached to my hip
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and a photographer wanted to take us aside for a couple duo pics
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i reluctantly went
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😬
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and im really fucking salty that they came out pretty decent
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like can we not
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he had us literally straddling eachother for like 10 straight minutes, luckily none of those photos made the cut
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooo those are nice
but yikes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~probably because my "doneness" was written all over my face in those~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i am salt
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:dva_salt:365521119534645254>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo those are neat tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <@!350855105123319808>  we dropping our next mixtape
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH GOD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that venom cosplayer patrick

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): k-"this is the clingy ex?"
s-"yea and what about it?"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/justin-timberlake-stare-gif-4160811
Elfriede Faun (Tom): LMAOOO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NICE
Bill: Yeah those are pretty good photos.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG
Bill: Gotta stop being such a good cosplayer so no one asks you for photos. :3
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if she would stop trying to do couples cosplays with me that would also be great <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: True lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): gotta get Rebecca and Snow doing couples cosplays together
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): did i tell you guys about how they tricked me into jdoing a couples cosplay with snow AGAIN at CCE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): now what
N🆗ri (Marisa): w o t
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): rebecca started a She-ra swimsuit group and asked me to be catra
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i was like YEA DUDE
Bill: What the Catra thing?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and since anna had expressed interest in doing adora i thought she was gonna be adora
Bill: Yeaaaah I remember that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and then like the next day they made a full thing on instagram stories
Bill: ~~just. Bail~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): with snow as she-ra
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and snow messaged me like "OH LOOK THEY MAKE SWIMSUITS ALREADY THAT WE CAN BOTH GET SO WE MATCH REALLY WELL"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i was like
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): " mmm no im gonna make mine, and im not 100% sure im doing catra anymore"
N🆗ri (Marisa): is rebecca in on it or was it just unfortunate coincidence
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have no idea
Bill: I doubt it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats all squid squad
Bill: And even she was, she’s not like... the type to push a relationship like that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): monica was hella pushy with getting photos of me and snow at the marvel shoot
Bill: Especially since you’ve long moved on.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so im kinda like suspicious now
Bill: With you two or of you two.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): monica is never pushy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): of me and snow together
Bill: Oh that weird as fuck. Monica is the good one.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like solo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that marvel shoot was really weird
Bill: Well. Don’t make plans with BNE. Best way to avoid it I guess. ~~Goes against the point of BNE but~~
Bill: When rwby isn’t involved eh.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaaaa im being like extra careful now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because i know snows not even in bne discord, so they are relaying info to her >.>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which is fine, but....pls stop pairing her up with me for cosplays
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'm long past over *that*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah Monica is usually the chill one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but she and Snow were hanging out together most of the weekend
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WTF THAts SO WEIRD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like a “why you so obsessed with me” weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): basically, like i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and be like "oh shes just being friendly" but ...that marvel shoot was... odd
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s heckin weird
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Exes need to crawl off into some pit and just sit there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s really bizarre that snow deliberately tries to match with you
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): right???? thats definitely weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she wanted to do nuts and dolts pictures at katsu but after i told her i wasnt really comfortable doing them with her she changed her lineup to do summer that day instead, so at least she did that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah but I don’t think she even planned to wear silk on Sunday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She just pulled some last minute thing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And like yo props to you, if hal got a picture with Noah like Kurtis did with snow, I’d be dying of awkward
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Actually I am dying of secondhand awkward
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she also didnt own Vol 2 ruby until katsu
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and expressed zero interest in doing vol 2 huntress ruby
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because she thought the outfit looked weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): until i finished penny >.>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but yea im having a lot of awkward. that entire marvel shoot i was having awkward death
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that photo is so awkward its hilarious though
N🆗ri (Marisa): didn't penny die before ruby's outfit changed?
N🆗ri (Marisa): be like "sowwy i can't cosplay that with you it's not canon"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nope
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this is what she wanted to do
N🆗ri (Marisa): my rwby timeline is all off i gotta rewatch
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SNOWS SO WEIRD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s totally been up Megs butt
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She comments on all her pics and I’m like yo stop bein tHIRSTY
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Rent changed outfits twice so maybe that's why your confused?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she's very clingy
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH I FORGOT she does have 3 outfits
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Snow is mega clingy yeeeaaah I’m getting that impression
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s just weird to be so chummy with an ex like that idk
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i meannnn tbh im very good friends with...a lot of exes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): snow is not one of them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes one i try to keep away from
Bill: Ohhhh Otis Casey. I’ve met him before.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he goes to a lot of comic conventions, not so much anime
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hes nice, albeit awkward. as most people are at cons
Bill: Wait is he personable or quiet?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): very quiet
Bill: He’s at most rwby shoots.
Bill: Believe it or not.
Bill: Man I wanted to shoot at the park again...
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHhh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh.

Bill: “New phone who dis”
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO

Aldus Larian (Jess): OHHH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://genius.com/Blackway-and-black-caviar-whats-up-danger-lyrics
Aldus Larian (Jess): that would make sense i didnt see the movie
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh good
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I always get confused by lyrics without music notes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ok but
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Heart emoji
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh yeah i knew the lyrics
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _the heart emoji isnt in the lyrics_
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ya know what
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it might just be spiderman
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): because i remember hal tryna enthusiastically tell me that he was gonna cosplay peter b parker
Bill: *everyone* said that.
Bill: If you weren't cosplaying spider qwen, you were cosplaying ~~Nick Miller~~ Peter B Parjer
Bill: > Code: Doesn't work
> export code to local format to test on
> exported code runs perfectly
> Go back to original code
> Doesn't work
> *It's the same thing though*
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: I fixed it!
Bill: Everything works now, including the new code I was testing!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good dig at Hunter <@334090409389195266> 😂
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I saw my chance and I took it <:pew:543202259085950996>
