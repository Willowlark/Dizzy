Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I am sad because I just visited an apartment that I really fucking like. It has it's own dock on the Delaware river. And is dog friendly. And like... everything is included in rent.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So like fucking rip
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Story of my life

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Pay me more.
Bill: You could tell her Monday.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm going to
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like I think I should just ask for a raise at this point.
Bill: Be like “I really liked it! It’s out of my price range now hint hint”
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEAH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): SAY THAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thank sounds the like the dream ™ def see if you can get a raise

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:thenflourish:564838295108976680>
Bill: Yee
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@334090409389195266> did you decide whether or not you're going to Heather's thing tomorrow?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its kind of extremely far for me

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm probably gonna go
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll probably also be live tweeting here the whole time lol

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _then done come_
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *biiiiitch**what*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Wtf
Bill: Moms been on the phone this entire 2 hour drive.
Bill: Woman has no concept of not working anymore.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao isn't your mom the one trying to convince your dad to retire?
Bill: He knows when he’s going to retire lol.
Bill: I forget if it’s because of his benefits or they just calculated how much money they wanted.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh for some reason I thought your mom was like trying to get him to retire earlier or something
Bill: Actually last I talked about it with them she wants him to work part time cause he’s the type to get bored not having something to work on.
Bill: Wow she managed to talk the whole trip.
Bill: >.>
N🆗ri (Marisa): My neighbors are celebrating 4/20 I’m so upset
N🆗ri (Marisa): They aren’t even going outside like we requested last time so our house reeks
Bill: Call the cops?
N🆗ri (Marisa): What are they gonna do
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’ll just make the neighbors retaliate against us in some damaging revenge scheme
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea that's probably not safe judging from the things Marisa's told us about her neighborhood 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): BoJo got her car illegally towed on her birthday because she’s on the homeowners association committee board thing, and someone *else* on the board didn’t approve of something another resident wanted. So they towed her car in revenge
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~my car that BoJo uses~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): You've told us about gang activity and drugs being sold out of ice cream trucks
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh yeah!! We got a new ice cream guy, we at least knows how to sell ice cream
N🆗ri (Marisa): But he’s been going around since like February-early March when it was still freezing so he’s gotta be selling more than ice cream
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think the guy on our other side is also a drug dealer unless he just has a lot of friends who stop by for 2 minutes and stay in their car while he comes out to talk with them
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea sounds about right 😣
N🆗ri (Marisa): Luckily the gang stuff is mostly on the other side of the development <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Still too close for comfort 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Keep a box or bucket of glass by your front door so if someone tries to get in you can pour glass on the ground and hope their shoes are thin
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have a sword
N🆗ri (Marisa): And you didn’t murder me??? <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ESCUSE
Aldus Larian (Jess): I would never
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Obtain a family of skunks and put them in their house and see how they like the smell
Bill: Why am I so tired.
Bill: We’re sitting and chatting with the Mecurio’s which is usually fine but I’m just like. Extra tired.
Bill: They have a cute cat but it hasn’t been around since we got here and I’m sad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I feel like I went through a war I hurt my knee/hip during roller skating last night, and this morning Tom accident elbowed me in the nose like really hard so I have a head ache and my nose hurts 😭
Bill: Mood.
Bill: My heads so cloudy but I’m trying to be attentive and now they’re talking about someone they knew in college and that’s making me zone more.
Bill: Uguuuu
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): **Status Report:** Been here almost an hour... still waiting for people... we're just in the food court and people are eating

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok now we're just walking around the mall. We're in Hot Topic
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sweet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i just had the most psycho old lady
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she called saying she needed to schedule service for a flat tire and i said ok nj dealerships are closed on sundays but i can schedule you got monday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and she starts crying and saying she cant go to church tomorrow then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i say "well you could try a local repairshop"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and she goes "no i only go to costco or my dealership for tires"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then i go "well i can schedule the service and then you can take an uber or lyft to get to church tomorrow"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and she snaps and goes "are you CRAZY? i pay for a CAR?? why would i use THAT"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and im like 😬 "im trying to create a solution where you get your tire repaired and go to church" 😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then she goes "you dont know what youre talking about transfer me to a manager"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): God forbid she pays like $20 round trip for a Lyft while her car gets a repair that's probably a couple hundred...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its just a hole in her tire tbh like she could easily get that patched!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How is it possible to spend 20 minutes in Hot Topic... it's not that big and the merch isn't that great...
N🆗ri (Marisa): scrutinize everything
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I went back to the food court because I'm thirsty as shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And now we're waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And now they're browsing Claire's
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Holy fuck I'm ready to leave
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this is not an erik scene...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you can say youre not feeling well
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and ditch
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *I could have been playing Minecraft this whole time*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *I could have made a path to Marisa's by now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've gone through 25% of my phone battery already
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Now we're in Spencer's
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@301927856240459777> needs this shirt
N🆗ri (Marisa): that shirt speaks the truth
N🆗ri (Marisa): they *r* bad
Bill: Well do it like a girl on a first date, We’ll call you and you can say family emergency.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Matt, David, and I are sitting in the massage chair things because there's like, no benches or anywhere to sit in this mall
Bill: Welcome to the boyfriend but not really club.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What happened to the arcade place?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We still have yet to go
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's attached to the mall
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _accessory male friend_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's not even that. Heather and David are the only couple that's here
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *on the move again*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not trying to throw shade at anyone becaue wigs are hard, but.... ginny's weiss wigs bangs need help and i want to help her
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but shes also an incredible cosplayer and intimidates me
Bill: I’ve had three glasses of wine and we’re talking about church politics.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof, is that a good thing?
Bill: “Accessory male friend” is fucking hell man.
Bill: It’s not an argument. And I’m more conservative than most so I’m not offended.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh ok, not an argument is good
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: Reminding me parents actually are rational adults, rather than when it’s a short conversation where it sounds like they aren’t.
Bill: I very much like the Mecurio’s as well. They’re snarky, sarcastic, and straight forward.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We have finally made it to arcade
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Reloaded my card and immediately got alcohol
N🆗ri (Marisa): bad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Significant improvement in events
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHOA WHERED YOU GET DAT KIRI BOI
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): SHORK
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~im tempted to come~~
Bill: I’m at Easter dinner but otherwise <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): all my plans for the weekend have been cancelled so now im like.....hhhh need friend
Bill: Oh?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my mother is sick apparently, my brother has work at 12 tomorrow, so easter is cancelled lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i was supposed to head there today but not doing that anymore
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg that's so cute
Aldus Larian (Jess): The pic, not canceled plans
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): come hang with me leanna :3c
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean im leaving work soon and then having dinner BUT THEN im just dickin arond
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Bill: Ye go. Have good time.
Bill: That sounds awesome.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): or hang with PA squad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~prob awk with snow tho~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i just remembered snow is there so now im like nvm not worth the 1.5 hr drive
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): man snow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she so fake it make me mad sometimes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mood, even wish who is like not even connected to this group at all has commented on how fake she is xD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _omg really+
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _wish still did some problematic things at katsu but points for noticing that_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^ valid
Bill: Is things better with Wish Lee?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Snow seems less fake in person, at least when I chill with her. Maybe because I'm not Leanna or someone whose butt she's always up,  idk. Whenever I hang out with her she's fairly lax and normal :/
Bill: She doesn’t need anything from you.
Bill: Also you’re with her comfort group right now. She doesn’t have to fake it with squids.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea wsh is fine now, she has a gf so shes lax again
Aldus Larian (Jess): bless
Bill: Bless indeed.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): was dodgy for a bit but thankfully it passed xD
Bill: 🙏 getting over crushes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Valid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like normal Snow which I think I experience more often which is why I don't dislike her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So the girls decided to go *back* to the mall to do more shopping
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm probably going to peace out soon. Future brother-in-law is having a bonfire at his house that sounds much more appealing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We *were* going to do karaoke but now I'm not feeling it
Bill: Booze required.
Bill: And being the “accessory male friend” must suck.
