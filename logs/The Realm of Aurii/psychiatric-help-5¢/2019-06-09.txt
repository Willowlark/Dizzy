NğŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): Iâ€™m home but there was an incident with some kids in a dumpster filled with broken glass and it tipped my pent up anxiety and gave me a nervous breakdown and a psychotic outburst so that was great.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! ğŸ˜­
ElğŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oh no!
NğŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): I made some nice gashes on my arms

Aldus Larian (Jess): Mawisa! ğŸ˜­

Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! ğŸ˜­
Aldus Larian (Jess): You should def trim them. Are you ok now?
NğŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): I donâ€™t know
NğŸ‘Œkri (Marisa): If I trim them it would probably make things easier to scratch I did that to apples as a kid <:lenny:395307171539189760>

ElğŸ†“de Faun (Tom): You put some ointment on those bois?
