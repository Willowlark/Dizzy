Bill: Der was a cute girl on the ferry today. Too bad I couldn‚Äôt come up with a single thing to say other than ‚Äúyou‚Äôre cute‚Äù and I don‚Äôt consider that a conversation starter. It‚Äôs also the morning commute and people don‚Äôt talk during those, but putting that aside it‚Äôs a <:hmm:543194383885926403> moment.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uhhh maybe compliment something she's wearing or something
Bill: Couldn't find anything about it that was like, particularly popping.
Bill: Or a pin or something.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Do you take the ferry often?"*
Bill: oof
Bill: "Do you drive to work often?"
Bill: Anyway small talk is the most intimidating thing on earth.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): id prob just compliment her hair or eyes but im a girl
Bill: Yuuup, totes different.
Bill: Cons are at least easy mode, people wear their interests and if it's for photography purposes complimenting their looks makes more sense.
Bill: ~~the latter still doesn't *go* anywhere but~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): do we have a negativity jar?
Bill: No.
Bill: I didn't even mean like *that*, there's no flow of conversation from "your hair is nice" "thanks".
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea small talk hard especially if your never gon see that person again
Bill: yup
Bill: <:f_respect:575713016297947157>
Aldus Larian (Jess): eh. not really a loss
Bill: since when do we put meaning on the *F emote*...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also means you have nothing to lose <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Except having what little self confidence you have shattered like glass <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Not that I have enough to talk to a random stranger in NYC, ESPECIALLY not without a common thread like "Oh your a photographer". ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Aldus Larian (Jess): wut
Aldus Larian (Jess): how does not talking to one girl on the ferry shatter your confidence?
Bill: She could ignore you, say she'd rather not talk to you, actually say leave me alone...
Bill: All sorts of great stuff.
Bill: Facial expression, etc...
Bill: I'mma just work on smiling rather than looking away if we make eye contact. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): that prob a good place to start
Bill: we being any other simliar scenario, not like, that one person.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > makes eye contact 
> smiles
> she smiles back
> ~hacker voice~ *"I'm in"*
Bill: *That's it, that's how it works*
Bill: ~~then I invite her to my cult right~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no you have to ask her to break into someone's apartment to return their phone
Bill: HAVE seen a girl photographing, like, not touristy photographing, by world trade on the way home twice. Them I regretted not saying something too.
Bill: Gotta remember ~~Jason Bourne's~~ Matt Damon's best quote: "20 seconds of courage is all it takes for something amazing to happen".
Bill: From that movie where Jason Bourne and Black Widow run a zoo.
Bill: ~~we bought a Zoo is super cute watch it~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~speaking of Matt Damon, did anyone ever see Downsizing?~~
Bill: Nope.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): me neither. I just remembered it existed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i watched the first 20 mins and it was bad
Bill: my knee is trying reaaaaally hard to scab over and it's super uncomfortable. üò≠
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I KEEP FORGETTING TO SHAVE THE OTHER LEG IN THE SHOWER DAMMIT
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Well it‚Äôs _too late now_
Aldus Larian (Jess): what a mood
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): did you become todoroki
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): one side warm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Am I the right way to be a hair Todoroki hm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nope I‚Äôm inverse lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....maybe you are correct because he needs hair on the cold side to keep him warm
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BOOM I like that logic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): emailed that professor back after reading her articles bang bang
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hopefully this correspondance continues and culminates in a job offering weeeee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hopefully
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): whoa, desktop Discord uses a revolver gun emoji while mobile uses the water gun
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): why flights so expense
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): visiting noah between flight and hotel alone is clocking in at 650
Bill: ¬¨
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 350 flight is cray
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): holy shit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): why tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): not many flights fly to indiana apparently
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so the flights can get mad expense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Timing also factors in. You planning on going soon or in a while?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because last minute trips can get v expense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also try using Hopper because it'll let you know the best time to book to get the best price
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ooo ya lemme check hopper
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im hoping to fly out june 28 and come back the 30th or july 1st
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i guess booking from a little over a month out is sorta meh cause my flights are expense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok, yeah there's a chance flight'll drop before then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): downloading the app now
Nokri (Marisa): prices also drop a lot in the days right before the flight but then you run the risk of it getting sold out
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i cant imagine theres a buttload of people going to indiana though~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): why wants to go there amirite
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): could always road trip it <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): except dumb boys that get really sweet internships building parts for a collider
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THAT WAS THE PLAN but my mom was like "i dont want yo driving that far"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then reiley has peeps in ohio so they could ride with me til columbus
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i only drive 5 hours alone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my sister's fiance is frmo Indiana and they drive out there all the time to visit his parents
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah i wanted to make a road trip out of it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but my moms like _no thats so far_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~your mom and Rebecca would get along~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My mom??? Is being so unreasonable??? Telling me to get coverage for work Saturday so I can go to my aunts dinner. When I need the money. AND she didn‚Äôt tell me until today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not only is that nepotism but I need the money
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _because now I gotta pay for a flight cause she won‚Äôt let me drive_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
