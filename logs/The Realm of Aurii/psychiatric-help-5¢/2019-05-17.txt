Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So.... I just went off on Ethan and unfriended him so.... <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna):

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He just confirmed he supports the bans in Ohio and Alabama and Georgia wowee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Didn‚Äôt even try to justify his support
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Destroyed him and waited a few mins to make sure he saw it and then immediately unfriended him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And I'm gonna block him on insta
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm done with his shit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Constantly trying to argue with everything. Fuck off.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): How do you come on to my post and just say "why even have this post if you're still friends with me, I support bans"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "Bye bitch"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "thanks for telling me, bye!"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): How easy is it to block someone's number
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>

Nokri (Marisa): Oooo such good tea
The US is so messed up anymore
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its pretty effed
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like i dont understand people being pro-life, but i can accept if thats their own stance
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but to force it on other people is downright wrong
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its like banning you guys from eating peanut butter if im the only allergic one
Nokri (Marisa): i almost killed a friend in high school because i ate a peanut butter sandwich near her haha oops
Nokri (Marisa): people in the USA can be extremely closed-minded and don't understand other people's points of view
there's one girl i met in japan when i went in 2016. she was from texas, the first week as the group was getting to know each other we learned she was extremely staunch republication, mega conservative, super trump supporter. she chose Japan at random to go to and didn't know any japanese.
6 months later she was a totally different person. different outlook on minorities, hated trump, leaning towards liberal democrat. now she lives in australia with her taiwanese girlfriend of 2 years. when they started going out she was in awe of herself because a year beforehand she was against lgbt.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): dayum
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah experience really can trump (pun intended) a place a hate
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): usually the hate comes from not understanding
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woah <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: Good for you Leanna.
Bill: For ditching Ethan, not the choco friend list. ~~what fans does she think she has to hide her Snapchat from?~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She added a fucking warning about using filters
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also Grumpy Cat died
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what an awful day
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg NO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omfg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): welp im sad
Bill: I did not know smoking Ben affleck was an emoji and tbh that‚Äôs. My reaction to everything this week and I‚Äôm here for it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i had to add it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because its a constant mood
Bill: Ahahaha
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: Really is.
Aldus Larian (Jess): We should have all called out and went to the beach
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's too nice to be inside
Elfriede Faun (Tom): üëÜ
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò≠
Bill: It‚Äôs not too late.
Aldus Larian (Jess): uhh yea it is
Aldus Larian (Jess): im literally at work
Bill: Your <relative here> just died.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i am a very bad liar
Aldus Larian (Jess): and hes all pissed off today already
Bill: oof. That's okay, I dun't need to be shirtless today anyway.
Bill: Besides the ocean is probably still cold.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): people on the radio are talking about how theyre all in puerto rico and now i want to go....
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah May is kind of early for beaching up
Aldus Larian (Jess): well tom doesnt swim so its good for him to get before it gets too hot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same
Aldus Larian (Jess): more like hang out on boardwalk and stuff
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's more pleasant before the summer crowd hits too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...or after
Aldus Larian (Jess): yee
Bill: Say the word.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bird
Bill: Good meme but also I'm the one who constantly want companionship, better the people with lives decide when to go. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I only have time memorial day weekend, which is when the beach is a zoo
Bill: I read this this morning and was like 'oh relationship trouble', but now I see their girlfriend (the other Steph) posted on it and got a heart react and now I'm confuse.d
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz depression is powerful and can make you not feel needed even if you have all the love in the world
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz there are other people they may not feel needed by other than thier S/O
Bill: It's more about how that vague post sounds very high school...
Aldus Larian (Jess): alot of lgbtq people lag behind in figuring themselves out since they weren't given the same opportunities and freedoms as straight/cis kids
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean that in the nicest way possible, because its a shame its like that
Bill: mhmm.
Bill: No I totally get it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and also depression and its shitty thoughts know no age limit, it may not even be vague. they could literally just feel that no one needs them
Nokri (Marisa): the hyperbole and a half comics have the best description of depression i've ever read
idk if i've shared it before, probably, but if anyone is interested in reading them i can post
Nokri (Marisa): http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html
Nokri (Marisa): http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html
Nokri (Marisa): she hasn't updated the site since 2013 but i hear she's doing ok now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I love her. Have you read her book?
Nokri (Marisa): aaaaaages ago, i remember reading it but i don't remember what it was about <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
all her stuff is gold tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lots of stories of her childhood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I remember one about her eating an entire chocolate cake
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I love the shitty MS Paint illustrations. They're what really make it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *HOW IS IT ONLY 9:45*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....mood
Aldus Larian (Jess): i only read part 1 so far but yea accurate
Nokri (Marisa): there was like a year in between the two comics because she relapsed back into it
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like
1. sad
2. Mad cuz sad
3. Sad cuz mad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): emotions suck
Nokri (Marisa): and then the second one goes into the next stage
||4. nothing! absolute nothingness.||
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò≠
Bill: Oh I don't like those steps.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG THE FISH
Nokri (Marisa): <:mood:543191222127296522>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/10/menace.html#links
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): here's a funny one to liven the mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ugh someone saved one of our ISO documents as the wrong file name which overwrote the file with that file name...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm the only person that really deals with the one that got overwritten so there's a possibility it might have been me...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ...but somehow I doubt it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): How much younger is Casey than Ethan?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): If anyone knows
Aldus Larian (Jess): umm 7 years? 8 years? i think? not possitive
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think he's 27 right
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And she's prob like 21 ?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ya know, i have no idea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he's 27, I think she's like 22?
Aldus Larian (Jess): from his views on womens rights I would have guessed he was at least 65
Bill: I'd say zing but it's not even funny how true that is.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof that concert I wanted to go to is not as cheap as I expected... $46
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *plus fees*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if it was a weekend, *maybe*, but not worth it for a Tuesday night
Aldus Larian (Jess): Boss: "this has some weird mark on it you need to get rid of in the digital file"
Me: "Thats pencil"
"no its not"
*picks up pencil, erases it* "yes it is"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok, so I want to start by apologizing for the block of text that I‚Äôm about to dump here, and I hate doing it the day before laser tag in case it makes things awkward, but I‚Äôve been having some really shitty thoughts lately with the whole abortion topic. Every time it comes up it depresses the ever living shit out of me.

As y‚Äôall know, I lean towards the conservative side but I try to stay neutral in things to avoid confrontation and debate (which I guess differentiates me from Ethan). But abortion is really really hard to stay neutral on and I‚Äôm gonna throw this out here in case you haven‚Äôt guessed yet, but I do consider myself pro-life. I see the whole stance of ‚Äúlife begins at conception‚Äù because that‚Äôs literally where we all started, but I get that people don‚Äôt see the zygote or embryos as ‚Äúpeople‚Äù when so early in development so I get why people also don‚Äôt see it as I do. I hate abortion and I hate that it‚Äôs a solution to unplanned pregnancy, but at the same time I really hate the idea of putting restrictions on women‚Äôs reproductive rights. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair and I know that women are constantly getting the shit end of the stick of life in general and I‚Äôm sorry. So you can see how torn I am in this issue and it‚Äôs really fucking tearing me up inside.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This might also be a result of me struggling with some other shit lately and I‚Äôve really been questioning my faith which really hurts because it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve grown up with my entire 25 years of existence so it‚Äôs really hard and painful when you start questioning things you‚Äôre so accustomed to. I‚Äôm confused about a lot of things at the moment and I don‚Äôt know what to trust right now. I‚Äôm scared of losing my faith and I‚Äôm scared of losing friends and honestly I‚Äôm just not in a good head space right now and I‚Äôm trying really hard not to lose it at my desk today. 

I don‚Äôt normally post things like this out of fear of losing friends and I‚Äôm not really opening up for debate. I‚Äôm just trying to work on expressing my emotions more rather than bottle them up every time something like this pops up. I‚Äôm sorry guys. I still love you all.

TL;DR: Being neutral is emotionally and spiritually exhausting and I‚Äôm not okay right now.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You don't have to apologize! It is indeed a hard thing to stay neutral on and I understand your struggle with it. I've struggled with it aswell and have my own personal views when you really get down to the core of it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Aww that‚Äôs okay Erik, abortion is just a lose-lose topic for you it sounds like. You‚Äôd hate for abortions to happen but also hate to regulate what women do, so there‚Äôs not really any way to have a comfortable opinion on the topic
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wont go further because you said you dont want to debate, and i dont want you too feel attacked.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We love you too though, we aren‚Äôt gonna think you‚Äôre a dumb poo poo head like Ethan
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I get it, its not an easy thing to come to a be-all-end-all on
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea theres a big difference
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Literally crying right now. You have no idea how much I love and appreciate you all. Thank you
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no, youre doing a me!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aww! we love you too!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _quick Erik, try to make it sound like you‚Äôre laughing to yourself_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately but that's my own stupid fault for staying up so late
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ya I think I saw you online at like 2 when I was still up lmao
Bill: It's an absolutely shitty break. Always remember that the world is not with us or with them, black and white. There are shades of grey between the two extremely vocal extremes in every scenario. There's nothing wrong with being in the grey, and imo I think you're a more well rounded person TO be considering both sides.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its not the have a moral dilemma that is the problem, its staying willfully ignorant of other others views that is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah I've been going to bed between like 2-3 for like, the past week... and then some before that...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~yeah ethan probably has no remorse about women‚Äôs rights been restricted~~
Bill: Ethan's a giant Uraraka boot.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): LMAO
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yes he FUCKING is
Bill: ~~Well if it's anything like before he ain't fucking much~~
Nokri (Marisa): The whole state of the US right now is a mess and that isn‚Äôt your fault, you just go on livin your best life üòé 
It‚Äôs the neeners like Ethan who are at fault
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Bill: You're a good man Erik. It's not an easy scenario to be a good man in, you'll automatically get pushed one way or the other. Your neutrality is a struggle but it just shows how much you care for people.
Bill: Ain't you ain't losing friends over this. Hell, even if you did, you wouldn't lose.
Bill: ~~Ohana~~ Aurii means Family.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üò≠
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah woo friendship!
Nokri (Marisa): I think that‚Äôs part of the issue. People are making complex topics Black and White when there‚Äôs a lot of grey area in between that isn‚Äôt being acknowledged
Bill: #politics
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah it how it be :(
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): literally took me like 10 minutes just to hit send on that message and my heart was racing the whole time and I felt sick
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awww no!
Bill: you get used to it!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I had a feeling you would feel the way you do
Bill: The anxiety of expressing emotions thing!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same here Jess
Aldus Larian (Jess): I noticed your topic change this morning and I was like "oh erik is prob haing some problem with this"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, I know it's bad to be ignorant of what's going on in the news but it's just so goddamn depressing and I don't need that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I'm right there with ya
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea I understnad
Bill: If it's an consolation I ignore the news.
Aldus Larian (Jess): some of these laws are just downright terrifying though esspecially as a woman
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I can understand prolife but I can also understand prochoice, so that just leaves me shrugging
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can't imagine what it must feel like
Bill: Hard enough to be happy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so like, bless the women out there
Aldus Larian (Jess): I heard that ohios rule may even prevent access to birth control altogether? but i havent had a chance to research
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Big oof yo
Bill: Time to move!
Aldus Larian (Jess): people shouldnt be forces from there homes over something like that though...
Nokri (Marisa): O im sorry if the conversation earlier was uncomfortable üôÄ 
At least you‚Äôre not the guy who was so ignorant he was like ‚Äúim not pro life or pro choice! I don‚Äôt care what people do, everyone should decide their on their own!‚Äù And people were like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs called being pro choice you Baka <:lenny:395307171539189760> ‚Äú
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I never understood the limiting birth control thing, who cares if you wrap your willy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But yeah the news right now is big sad
Aldus Larian (Jess): preventing ovulation isnt abortion ahhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Big Sad, capitalizes
Nokri (Marisa): They have new bulletproof hoodies
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....gonna be real with ya'll, i'm not gonna stop talking about it even if it makes people uncomfortable... it's really important to me.

But, being pro-choice doesnt mean pro- abortion, it just means allowing a woman to make that choie for herself. 
I don't think abortion should be used as a form of birth control, and shouldbe be abused. But these laws are horrifying to me, as well as many other women, because its taking away our human rights. 

But, with that said, erik you are nothing like Ethan, and nothing like a lot of these other people. Youre not gonna lose me as a friend, and i wont ever shame you for what you believe as long as youre not rallying to support the laws
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): üëèüëèüëè
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): One thing that I will throw out there is that there is a natural form of birth control that's Catholic Church approved‚Ñ¢ and is *allegedly* just as effective if not more than other forms <:pew:543202259085950996> 
It's just way more complex and a little awkward to monitor <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats basically how i feel aswell, not a form of birth control but there are situations where i think it should be a choice
Nokri (Marisa): I WHOLLY SUPPORT ABSTINENCE AND I THINK EVERYONE IN THE US SHOULD GET ON THIS MOVEMENT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~is it having the diddle at the time of the month~~
Bill: ~~It's overrated.~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wasn't talking about abstinence lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs just fucked up that that 11 year old that got raped has to be a mom now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Creighton Model
Nokri (Marisa): making kids is disgusting
Nokri (Marisa): ***WHAT***
Aldus Larian (Jess): according to the church It's better if i dont use that method <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): abstinence or death
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OH IS IT ANAL
Bill: https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-3CU5tmCJy8zMoN3mMD
Aldus Larian (Jess): no its abstinence lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just having sex during non ovulation times but not during the period
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh the period tracking yeah I know people that do that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no, it's tracking the consistency of your cervical mucus to find out when you're actually fertile <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): whooo! I do that too
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean
Aldus Larian (Jess): abstinence ya!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~gotta do that to know when it‚Äôs least risky to do it without a peen baggy lmao~~
Nokri (Marisa): i honestly can't wrap my head around why anyone would want to do the lewd. it sounds so gross and awful
Aldus Larian (Jess): im sorry üò¶
Nokri (Marisa): are you apologizing to me? :0
***jess did you do the lewd. impossible.***
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It is kinda gross ü§î
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jess can‚Äôt do the lewd, Tom is a Virgo!
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _Dont <:ishetho:573830887485997097> me, it‚Äôs kinda gross sometimes_
Aldus Larian (Jess): yes i do the lewd
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao it totally is
Elfriede Faun (Tom): In theory
Aldus Larian (Jess): in theory
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THANK YOU TOM
Aldus Larian (Jess): but so is like any human bodily function
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But instincts say otherwise
Nokri (Marisa): u got me there
Nokri (Marisa): not the instincts thing i don't get that
Nokri (Marisa): the human thing

Bill: LOL OH MY GOD
Bill: That would literally cause me to PANIC
Bill: I felt awkward about AUDREY for *months* and I knew her Dad.
Bill: I'm a single, overweight, 25 year old man with a camera like. If I saw a child of mine around anyone with that description *I would be a little concerned*.
Bill: I get it.
Bill: ~~Ya'll have safety male to keep creeps away, I have safety female to inform the world I'm not a creep~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Pfft mark loves you dude plzz
Nokri (Marisa): one girl at katsu who was like, 15-16? was really rad though. she was an emma cosplayer and her mom was cosplaying isabella
Bill: *I know* and I was still concerned!
Bill: She added me on facebook and I was like <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881>
Bill: Even though I already had her dad.
Bill: So ye.
Bill: I get SUPER concerned about peoples age.
Nokri (Marisa): we're so old
Nokri (Marisa): i think the younger crowd is more likely to go out and meet people at cons whereas older folk already have established circles so they're less likely to go searching for new people. not that it means they don't want to meet new people, just that they aren't constantly seeking it out like younger ones.
Bill: Yeah that sounds about right.
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> üò≠
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): first time going to Tanoshiicon I got talking with a girl cosplaying fem!4th Doctor
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): eventually found out she was in 8th grade and I was like üò¨
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò≠
Bill: MUCH oof
Bill: Lol
BNE: ‚ÄúErik and Leanna never complain in vent anymore, they must be in a really good place
Meanwhile, in Aurii:
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: ~~only you two specifically cause you weren‚Äôt in Aurii originally~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/party-onfire-pizza-shocked-shook-gif-5168995
Bill: All of us kept our real shit here.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): aurii vent
Bill: From the start.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): to be fair, bne never has anything thought provoking to say in the vent channel
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaa
Bill: True.
Bill: You have to imagine the squids have their own private channel.
Aldus Larian (Jess): BNE too big
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they do, its instagram group chat though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so less superior
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how the heck do they solely communicate with that
Bill: Oof insta.
Aldus Larian (Jess): inta chats are so bad
Bill: Yeah BNE has always been too large for real depth.
Bill: It got worse when we went from 20 to 30.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i need like... 6
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this chat is like the largest groupchat i can function in
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): agreed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): without getting overwhelmed
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaaa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): anything beyond that becomes memes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Nokri (Marisa): we're teetering on the edge of memes <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): TRUE DAT
Bill: Though we have quite a few lurkers.
Bill: Andrews working his way out of that I‚Äôm so proud.
Nokri (Marisa): BIG BUG
BIG BUG AAHHHH SYLVIA WONT RUN AWAY FROM IT BUT I CANT ABANDON HER
Nokri (Marisa): In theory if I go downstairs she will follow after a minute or two but I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôll get hurt in that minute
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lunchtime for Sylvia <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): I waited on the stairs just out of sight but where I could still monitor her and she came over and we have evacuated the second floor. Guess it can never be used again.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WHAT KINDA BUG
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): a big one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lorge
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): A Motherfucker :TM:
Nokri (Marisa): Bigger than my index finger probably?? It has wings and a weird shaped butt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm so tired now
Aldus Larian (Jess): food coma
Bill: yyeeeeee
Bill: emotions coma.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lack of sleep coma
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I closed my eyes and legit started daydreaming
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): all of the above
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): time for a nap
Bill: you need some sugar my guy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nah because sugar is carbs so counterproductive to carb coma
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *time to pop some excedrin for caffeine boost*
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was bloating so bad the past week and it all went away this morning
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hoorah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thanks hormones for making me think im ballooning
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oof finally got an email from that cosplay club
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it sounds so... vague
Aldus Larian (Jess): ITS IN COMIC SANS
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHH
Bill: don't go alone.
Bill: All I got for you.
Bill: OOooh Erik, Hunter has Shutff?
Nokri (Marisa): It doesn‚Äôt sound so bad, just vague 
Great font choice
Bill: Oh that's actually pretty cool.
Bill: Hmm. The shapes have pretty obvious artifacting around the outlines.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so disorganized
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AND comic snas
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ITS SO VAGUE WHAT IS THIS EMAIL TELLING ME TO DO
Nokri (Marisa): Accept the membership invite and email them if you wanna work on the mysterious promotion project <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but its mysterious!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh the things Hunter posted are neat but the lines are so pixelated
Bill: yeah, it must be because he's new at using an ipad.
Nokri (Marisa): Looks like he just magic wand‚Äôd it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yikes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you gotta spline select that shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or refine edges at least
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): looks like he magic wanded a picture of the emblem and deleted it because there's still white bits
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is it bad that I want to steal that idea and just... do it myself?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea I saw that last night
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Soooooo.....looks like lissy and meg have their own avengers GB group forming
Bill: looool
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And I'm squinting at them like ????
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I mean OK
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lmao
Bill: Most the GB group formed on discord and they don't use Discord.
Bill: They probably have no idea.
Bill: ~~except I'm sure Snow told them~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Some of us have posted about it on insta
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And twitter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Snow probably dropped ours to join theirs
Bill: yup.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Snow probably left our group to join megs
Bill: They can have her tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I really like lissy though so I feel bad being salty
Bill: that's a universal mood Lissy is great.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She and Meg have done fem Cap and Bucky before
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Pretty sure that was one of the first cosplays they did together
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm sure shes gonna look fantastic, go lissy. Meg will be great too, I'm just confused as to why they're specifically planning a second GB avengers group for the exact same convention
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Just to be petty?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ü§∑
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh well
Bill: Beeeecause they don't feel like they're part of BNE and it's branch ground?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~who's Lissy doing this time?~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's no ones fault though, they alienated themselves
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Lissy is doing thor
Bill: Both because of distance and all the drama.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): NICE
Bill: And Meg doing Iron man, full iron man.
Bill: Well, the nicest thing to do would be to say "Hey, I'm doing Cap and I'd love to take some pictures with you guys too! Would you want the info for our group as well?"
Bill: You know, olive branch it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea I'm tempted to be petty back... but in the kill em with kindness kind of way
Bill: ~~I don't think their being petty~~
Bill: based on what you said, maybe I'm missing something.
Bill: There is no way in hell Meg is going to think she welcome in a group Georgia is core in. ~~She probably isn't.~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): .... I do. Because I think between snow and hunter the info got to them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And only after I told hunter did meg post about doing iron man
Bill: Hmmmm.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I know some of y'all are iffy about Meg, but it would have been cool to have her as our full Iron Man. I'm sure her suit is gonna look fantastic
Bill: Snow being manipulative is a thing true Leanna.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOOOOO LETS SHARPEN THE WORBLA SPEARS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): what a coincidence
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats crazy them doing a genderbent after we posted all over social media about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea... like its sketch seeing lissy post about thor right after snow leaves
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): whered they post about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Twitter
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): nyoom to see for myself
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She retweeted a thor post and commented "WOOO THIS  IS GONNA BE ME KATSUCON 2020"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean i like lissy but
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:ishetho:573830887485997097> meg tho <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Bill: ^ Mm, which is why I‚Äôd guess they don‚Äôt feel welcome. Package deal.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): whats the bets that they know of the group
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean they must know by now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They definitely know
Bill: Pretty good they do.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's just funny to me that instead of asking about it or commenting on Anna's post or one of mine or something( about the characters we're missing). that they instead just start a whole second group <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): To be fair I could have asked them myself but I didnt want to rock the boat
Bill: If it was an Instagram post I‚Äôd consider asking what her plan is, but I don‚Äôt use twitter so. She‚Äôd be able to smell something up.
Bill: Well, if it was just Meg and Lissy, would you be open to them joining? Lissy and Georgia would twin but that‚Äôs beside the point.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But like that's so ... obvious xD. Not that it's a totally original idea or anything, but if theres already an entire group happening??? Why not try to join that group??
Bill: (They also may have assumed the characters they want to be, as main characters, are taken)
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm not against them joining, in just worried about others who have an issue with meg, more specifically Georgia. I dont want Georgia to feel unwelcome because I obviously care about her more than i care about meg or lissy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): are they making a group or is it just them two?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Seems like they're trying to get the Delaware peeps to do it
Bill: Might be the new Darling group
Bill: Ye, I was going to say if you didn't want them it's kinda a moot point if they asked to join or not before making their own group.
Bill: Maybe ask Hunter if he knows whats up?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's not that big of a deal to me, I just thought it was funny to see that snow left and then see lissy join meg on the GB marvel train
Bill: Meg had a story post about Iron man before Snow left.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I just dont want to deal with any kind of dumb rivalry for no reason
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea before snow left but meg made that most after I told hunter
Bill: Just take the high road and it'll be fine!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): In my head I'm just seeing the civil war poster
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But like our group vs mega group in like the dumbest war imaginable
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Megs*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üòÇ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg and then it is cap vs iron man
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _yo_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Bill: It's not Civil war BNE edition until Hal joins a Meg's squad.Then it would be Civil War II.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üëÄ
Bill: But also lets *not* have drama going into Katsu.
Bill: *We already cut out Scott*
Bill: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: We, I.
Bill: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Basically my reaction to this is " pls no"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Please dont make this a Thing‚Ñ¢
Bill: Ye no thing. Just everyone do everyone.
Bill: Actually so...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~watch as hal joins as valkyrie~~
Bill: Endgame is the biggest thing this year.
Bill: ~~You have Andrew as Valkyrie you're safe~~
Bill: Since endgame is so big, I'm sure Saturday of Katsu is going to look like NYCC.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It is, and I can see how we all got to the same idea, its just *funny* üëÄ
Bill: ye I just realized myself.
Bill: ~~I'll be super original by being Jessica, haha~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That they are all planning for katsu and not any con before that üëÄ
Bill: Well, that is group cosplay con.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Btw I realize this seems like I'm like " omg they cant do the same thing as us" which isnt what I mean, everyone can cosplay whatever they want, whenever they want. Totally cool. It's just the timing that made me just go <:lenny:395307171539189760> <:minathink:544567715931750405>  "ok then"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like kinda in a cheeky way
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Not an "I'm upset" way
Bill: Yeah I get chu.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm excited to see their costumes o3o
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nah watch Hal do Widow but he'll probably try to be thotty with it and try to Spiderman meme with me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AHAHAHAHA
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh lawd lmao
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): JSJDBDB
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AHAHAHAHA IM LAUGHING SO HARD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HAL WANTS TO BE ERIK SO BAD ITS SO FUNNY
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMFAO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LITERALLY literally its so obvious
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): with the whole totty denki
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hal saw it was popular on erik and obviously wanted to copycat
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH THAT WAS FUCKING HILARIOUS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): erik is the man on the pedestal for hal
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hal likes to be well liked with people
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hes not really well liked with most people now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): erik, well liked
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): therefore, hal copies erik
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg please i want to see that he does widow now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~if meg even lets him in her group~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ugh I have to drive to Delaware for a friend's grad party but I'm so tired lol
Nokri (Marisa): this late? :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah not really sure why it's tonight. Graduation was today so maybe just planned to have everything the same day
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I also had selected "maybe" on the event page
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But just switched to going
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): my sister got her SAT back for the second time, 13 points behind me lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): shes running around yelling 13 POINTS WHY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~granted i took it one off, this is her second time and she had a private tutor but shush we wont tell her that~~
Bill: Someone is proud of her score.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i have to be the smart kid otherwise i have nothing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lily plays 5 instruments and kate gets athetlics
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i need _something_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lmao
Nokri (Marisa): literally who in this world goes "instead of taking pills or using a condom or another birth control method, i'm going to spent a LOT of money to get IMMENSELY painful surgery that will make me bleed and feel sore for several days and give me temporary depression and/or PTSD."
Bill: Loooool he‚Äôs regretting it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea because I dragged him and then blocked him from contacting me on any media and through text
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So he cant explain himself or take it back lol
Bill: Good(?) news; he likes you!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So now hes publicly posting
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I mean, yes I know, but the thing is... I dont like him
Bill: eyyyyyy
Bill: No complaints here.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe he'll finally learn you weren't joking when you said you didn't like him
Nokri (Marisa): that's just a thing friends say to each other. real casual.
