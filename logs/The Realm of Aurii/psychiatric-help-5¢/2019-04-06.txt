Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👀👀👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She originally said she'd have the first draft in 1-2 days... 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HAL POSTED SONG LYRICS TO A SONG I EXPLICITLY TOLD HIM I LOVED
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What thE FUCK
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Literally he would always text me saying he doesn’t like the song but he always thinks about t
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Um... not to be that guy, but.... if hes ARO....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that song doesnt exactly ... apply
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That song is kind of a stretch in regards to answering the question
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He knew what he was doing in picking it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yeaaaaa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yikes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Weird
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mixed signals dude
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hol up I gotta listen to this song
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Is it the country song?
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm listening to country for Georgia
Aldus Larian (Jess): I've def heard this song before
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _ok it’s because my dad is from Kentucky so he would play country music in the house so hearing country music makes me happy because I think of my dad_
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol this def seems like a stretch for him
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye my whole family listen to country Sept me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): #sussexcounty?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BUT YEAH WEIRD RIGHT
Aldus Larian (Jess): #youknowit
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea that seems like a real stretch
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _hal boi you really want my attention dontcha_
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's like some secret message shit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah really
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Whatever it is, it’s goin over my head LOL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Is it because the song has literally nothing to do with love?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Watch how he blinks maybe he’s trying to send you a message in Morse code
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t know?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is he trying to be sentimental like “hey look remember this good memory”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or is it like “BITCHES LIKE THIS SONG U JERK”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Reality is probably somewhere between
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm just gonna say, if it ever comes to light that he has regrets breaking things off, I won't be shocked
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEEY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I remember tom sayin that too 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If he ever sends me a “can we get back together” text I’m printing it out and framing it on my wall to laugh at
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea we've both said that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like he'd at least have the decency to not do that while you're in a relationship... so just... don't break up with Noah lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No plans to 👉😎👉
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I never realized how many things about Hal that were a problem til I dated Noah tbh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like sometimes I’d get upset because of a bunch of built up things and hal would just kinda argue back at me, and Noah already knows me enough to go “ok so what’s really been bothering you, talk to me”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And that’s 1 year versus ~7 months relationship
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🎉
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Jess remember Memorial Day where I was like “idk if hal and I are compatible” and then resolved to work through it?? Hal just quits at the first sign of trouble
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Y E A H
Aldus Larian (Jess): You get to spend more time with Noah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah definitely
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Long distance is hard to begin with and sometimes Hal just wouldn’t talk to me about things
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I already realized he never credited me for the Chestnut Hill Pictures 😡
N🆗ri (Marisa): the neighbor's dogs have been barking for an hour and won't stop <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
they also aren't supposed to have any dogs
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HEART REACTS FOR GOOD LUCK ON GRE PLZ AND THANK
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good luck!
Bill: I. Could be nice to Hunter.
Bill: If he has an interest in talking to wedding photographers/assisting... Ron is moving to Georgia pretty soon, but he's still been doing weddings around here for 20+ years.
Bill: It'd also be a *little* mean because Ron does NOT know how to shut up.
Bill: But they both love photoshop, are eccentric... Ron's day job was teacher so he can put up with Hunter being, well, Hunter.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hunter also doesnt know how to shut up
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Might be a good match
Bill: Lol yup.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The lightbulb started to flicker. Soon it will be pitch black and there will be no more light. When that happens no one better steal my amazon packages. Tell my stories.
