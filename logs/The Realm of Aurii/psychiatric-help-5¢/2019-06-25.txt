Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So last week when our customer's engineer came, he informed us that at some point in the future, their facility in California is probably going to be switching to a new company to buy certain cables from (because the system we have in place now is super inefficient). But, they have other new cables they want to give us to make to compensate so we don't lose too much of their business because we're on pretty good terms with these guys. So anyway, the cables that we eventually will stop making will be the cables that have plugs that keep breaking and I'm so fucking relieved lol
Nokri (Marisa): Doctors visit was only an hour long but I need *another* blood test and an ultrasound and he gave me more stuff <:rise:582318089228648456>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): anything bad?
Nokri (Marisa): They’re still looking but they have me on a lot of stuff now and this is the fourth blood test this month
Nokri (Marisa): They’re also suggesting a spinal tap but hhhhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yikes 😧
Nokri (Marisa): Basically, almost every major physical and mental condition that could cause depression, from hormone deficiencies to a lack of neurotransmitters, I have. <:pew:543202259085950996>  And it all leads to other issues that are causing my body to shut down. Eyyy.
Nokri (Marisa): And major heart risk but I don’t think that’s anything new
Nokri (Marisa): They’re recommending that I not go to Otakon but I already got the ticket so they’re saying maybe I should visit a specialist while I’m down in DC.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Specialist for deficiencies? Or?
Nokri (Marisa): I’m not sure, the doctor just said he knew a specialist around DC, didn’t say what kind. I assume on depression caused by low/high levels of everything
Nokri (Marisa): They gave me one of those little finger heart monitors I can bring and we can all pretend it’s an alligator biting our fingers
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are you gon be ok tho? Anything we should be on the lookout for at ota?
Nokri (Marisa): no no don't mind me it's ok have fun
Nokri (Marisa): i won't bother anyone i'll make sure of it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Plz don't die fren, you not bother. If there's anything you need me to bring for you let me know

El🆓de Faun (Tom): :///
El🆓de Faun (Tom): A spinal tap sounds a bit over kill
Nokri (Marisa): they want to look at the brain juice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was going to make a *This Is Spinal Tap* joke but I'm not sure if it's appropriate for this conversation
Nokri (Marisa): parks and rec?
Nokri (Marisa): o it's a movie :0
Nokri (Marisa): it's a highly rated movie? :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): omg I just checked the rating and it has an 8/11 on IMDB
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's a mockumentary of a fictitious 80s hair metal band. One of the classic jokes is that their amplifiers go to 11
Nokri (Marisa): oooooo that makes sense
8/11 sounds like an interesting scale otherwise
Glonk: <@386874959009415170> I had the same thought

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rowing machine
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s a full body workout and that did me a hurt
Nokri (Marisa): O I asked earlier and the doctor said they don’t test blood types or keep records of those at all, they said no one really does anymore because the only time you’ll need to know your blood type is when donating or receiving blood, and they’ll test it on the spot. 
Makes sense because blood is a lot more complex than “a/b/o” and there’s a lot of factors they have to check for, so they don’t waste resources checking unless it’s necessary.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or when there's a pregnancy complication because sometimes the baby's type is in compatible with the mothers
Aldus Larian (Jess): If your blood type is O and your baby's is A B or AB your body may attack your baby
Nokri (Marisa): Nooo don’t do that
Aldus Larian (Jess): You can determine if that's a risk by getting both parents types a ahead of time <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think there's something you can take to correct it as well?
Nokri (Marisa): Is it blood
Aldus Larian (Jess): Some sort of shot. 2 doses one at 28 weeks and 1 within 72 hours f birth
Nokri (Marisa): slurp
