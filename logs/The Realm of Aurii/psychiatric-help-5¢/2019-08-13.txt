Bill: oh I'm salty.
Bill: I came up with this idea in the workshop for the us to evaluate our different sources based on the their estimates versus what actually happens. Basically analyzing how good they are guessing.

I didn't implement that, it was given to an intern for the team. Which is fine. But now Sheema saying it was the intern's idea. =T
Bill: Not that I understand this insanity, but.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nice big Es
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): technically they're nice big S's
Bill: ~~fuck math~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I got an email from Rooster teeth about my FIRST membership being renewed in November at the current price and then 4 hours later received another email saying it'll be billed at the new price?
Bill: I got the same thing.
Bill: The new price is ridiculous too.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's technically *only* $2/month more, but like, since it's billed annually, that's a $24 increase
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): fuck that
Bill: it's what, 12 a month now?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): $3
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): current price is $36/year
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): being bumped up to $60/year
Aldus Larian (Jess): what the fuck
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): RWBY is on VRV though, right?
Bill: "We're increasing the cost to improve the animation quality of our top shows."

"Genlock."

"You want us to improve genlock right?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): >increases FIRST price
>people start cancelling FIRST memberships
Bill: I might.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): RT: <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I probably will. RT's getting greedy. They're trying to grow too quickly
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just emailed support to clarify
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm pretty sure RWBY gets uploaded to VRV at about the same time as RT? A week later maybe? Will probably just continue from VRV
Aldus Larian (Jess): i saw an ad for rwby on crunchyroll
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah it's on there too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): VRV is run by Crunchyroll
Nokri (Marisa): Do they still post it on YouTube?

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): didn't Lee say that she told Casey she wasn't going to be her MOH?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea I did, i apologized to her and said i didnt want to be MOH because of Ethan. 

It's possible she never told him? Or was uncomfortable telling him because I said it was because of him?
