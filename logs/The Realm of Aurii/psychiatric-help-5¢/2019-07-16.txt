Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH
Kaio Vermino (Lee): by a stalker "nice guy" who played games with her and talked on discord a couple times
Kaio Vermino (Lee): he was apparently jealous because she was supposed to be going to a festival with some other dude she met over discord
Kaio Vermino (Lee): and he lost his shit and stalked her and put her in his car and beheaded her, took photos and posted them to his instagram story

Bill: Spending more up front for the hard disks in the NAS will result in faster read/write from the NAS than the smaller disks which matters to me but I don't really need the extra 4tb/100 dollars a disk but I want the speed and it's good to future proof and I need to decide before the sales end or the whole thing is a wash and I'm already stressed so like? fucking disks.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My gums are so fucking sore from this morning. My dentist *really gets in deep* with that metal pick, scraping away...
