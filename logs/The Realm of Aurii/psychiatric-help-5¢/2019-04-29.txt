N🆗ri (Marisa): I have to start making invites this week <:hmm:543194383885926403> would anyone like one
Like a physical non-Facebook one. You can get one even if you have no intention of coming. Make it into a nice party hat for a later occasion.
Bill: you realize we'll absolutely come to a party in your honor right.
N🆗ri (Marisa): You shouldn’t it’s far and boring
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i would like one owo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): can i get the date again so i can put it in my calendar
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can get them to play an anime movie after boring lunch to make it worth your time but I gotta figure out how to work the projector
N🆗ri (Marisa): June 2nd, I think is a Sunday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): okie i have saved the dae
N🆗ri (Marisa): I am thinking of ways to make it less boring. Trivia is a possibility but there will be a very large gap in knowledge among attendees <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): They changed the date on the calendar emoji woah
N🆗ri (Marisa): It used to be March something but now it says July
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): o good sunday is more convenient for me, that is a sunday nice
Bill: *hanging out with you will be all the entertainment I need*
Bill: Maybe I'll see about visiting south jersey all of that weekend.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Good idea if you come bring entertainment like a kid on a road trip
Bill: I need to see Jen and Jeremy too.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also YE WE WAN COM
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Assuming we not busy yo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wat is party for?
Bill: Mawisa graduating.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Congraduations!
Bill: > person behind me in line keeps bumping my bag
> step forward
> they keep doing it
> look over shoulder 
> it’s a couple and they’re bumping into me cause they’re holding hands
> 😑
N🆗ri (Marisa): those must be some giant hands to take up so much space
Bill: Or they forgot what personal space is.
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe they're on drugs, that happens to people on drugs
they'll be behind you in line and literally just keep pressing themselves against u each time you move up
Bill: They’re tourists.
N🆗ri (Marisa): horrifying
Bill: I’m a block from world trade.
Bill: That’s normal.
Aldus Larian (Jess): not being able too goof off sucks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mood
N🆗ri (Marisa): time for a body double
N🆗ri (Marisa): dont you have two other jess's in your office that you haven't slain yet?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea the one is the one behind me now, i.e. reason i cant goof off anymore
Aldus Larian (Jess): except when hes in meetings like rn
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***what are you waiting for, slay them***
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like not being in jail
N🆗ri (Marisa): have you ever tried it
3 meals a day and free healthcare
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/television-the-office-aZeFIjI9hNcJ2
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof Matt only got 3 photos back from his shoot with Hunter?
Bill: I guess? Unless Hunter DM'd him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Possibly
Bill: It's Hunter, he doesn't care about not bees and men and Matt both.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But Hunter usually does his returns via discord
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I imagine Matt probably got two more than we saw back in DMs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wonder how many we're gonna get back
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And when
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If at all
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeahhhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Forgot bout our photos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Probably so did hunter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly I wanna see how long it takes him
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): To validate his unprofessionalism
N🆗ri (Marisa): did he put a turnaround time in his contract?
Bill: To be fair, if return time is the sole bar for professionalism I'm the worst kind of person.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have pictures of flora from 2016 i forgot to return
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but you don't charge real human dollars for your photos and I know it's a hobby for you so I never expect quick turn-around from you ~~except for the April Fool's one~~
Bill: True, one pays with an expectation in mind. You do have to make it clear tho.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and what I meant was moresao if he just forgot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because if you forget about a client and they paid you already, that's shitty
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I believe 6-8 weeks was in the sign up somewhere
Bill: For the record, I will (usually) give you an advance shot from a shoot if you ask. I don't really mind, I just need to have my photo drive and such on me.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s been about 6 as of this week I believe
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wonder what order he’s going in
Bill: From the sounds of it he was disappointed by 90% of his Zenkai stuff so his motivation may be down.
Bill: I get that.
Bill: Way less often though. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: ~~Meanwhile my Zenkai galleries are so large I'm avoiding them and doing newer, smaller galleries first~~
Bill: All the ones with the sync symbol need to be done still. 😭
Bill: CPAC and Kogara are done tho.
Bill: My 100% complete list has gotten rather impressive looking though. Noticed that yesterday.
Bill: And the non cosplay is growing too.
Bill: Was feeling Boudoir next as of yesterday, so. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: But today is Aurii writing day.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i really enjoyed doing non cosplay stuff that one day
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we should do more of those kind of trips
N🆗ri (Marisa): huNTER JUST ACCEPTED MY FACEBOOK FRIEND REQUEST

N🆗ri (Marisa): "Free shipping sale until 12/31/2019" sign me up
Aldus Larian (Jess): better hurry
Bill: Yeah Leanna. I’ve got three in mind for another trip like that, including ring wood manor.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): love that place
Bill: Van syke castle ruins in the woods, Paterson waterfall, and ring wood.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lot of trash at paterson waterfall, gotta be tactical with shooting, but if you do it well then photos will come out good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): chris used to live 1 min away from it when i met him
Bill: Ooooh. And Jess wanna do buttermilk falls at some point.
Bill: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HVDEpKSmRWukN61k0H4cyFQOPP7u_ynT&usp=sharing All the yellow and blue are places to confirm. Blue are rumored good, Yellow someone confirmed good but I haven't been, green is good and free, red is good but costs money to use.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Do you mean actual trash or the people
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): when we doin a dapper shoot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): suits for everybody
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO no i mean actual trash
Bill: why suits? The manor?
N🆗ri (Marisa): suits shoot 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if dapper suit shoot instead of party
just a catered photoshoot with onlookers nbd
Bill: We having party to love and appreciate you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): in this party we love and appreciate suits
N🆗ri (Marisa): the U is for Usain Bolt
Bill: You realize you can’t beat me in a reaction game right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): but i can play the waiting game
Bill: *I can play the ban you from reacting game*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Umm, no
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m going to not do any of that thanks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Georgia's anti-Big Three
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah this dude is on my "annoys the shit out of me" list
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg do you even know them
what a crass way to talk to someone you don't know wow
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He interacts with me a bit but like, I don't personally know him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What the fuck that guy guesses Shazam on mine
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Another gem from a past convo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was scrolling through and I leave him on read A LOT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lol mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can't really see but you can see enough how much I don't respond lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): this guy messages you more than i get messages in a year yikes
N🆗ri (Marisa): obviously you're bbfs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *I didn't mean it in a negative way, but that's how he took it*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm surprised he hasn't tried to add me on FB yet because we've been in the same thread on some cosplay page
N🆗ri (Marisa): o oops i didn't realize rebecca was being rocket now i'm embarrassed
N🆗ri (Marisa): dropping out of bne to hide in shame
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought she was doing Dr. Strange
N🆗ri (Marisa): o
o yeah she did talk about that
i do an embarrassed confusion now
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do i tell hal i already have a naofumi 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think Anna meant your name
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rebecca hasn’t spoken in a while
N🆗ri (Marisa): rebecca come back and clarify your intentionssss
N🆗ri (Marisa): bless ny'all
N🆗ri (Marisa): if she wants to do rocket tho i don't wanna take it from her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm *waiting* for Hal to say he'd do Valkyrie
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm *WAITING*
Bill: OH that's Valkyrie.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I FUCKING THOUGHT THE SAME THING
Bill: She has a name doesn't she?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was like _is this bitch about to volunteer to **match me**-
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah, it's Valkyrie
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wait
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Brunnhilde
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but she's the last remaining Valkyrie so she just goes by Valkyrie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If Hal wants to be Valkyrie I’m gonna eat my own foot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There are many other girls to genderbend that aren’t directly related to me
Bill: You just need someone else to fill the role.
Bill: Her outfit is literally just a leather jerkin and pants. No genderbending even required.
Bill: At least in Ragnanok.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I had to mute BNE today
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk if imma unmute it 😬
Bill: Talk about the genderbend group.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa i uh didnt even kniw about that
Bill: Which part of me is like 'whenever it happens I'm going to wish I was doing it' but also like... I'm not terribly motivated?
Bill: Quite the dilemmma.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Started with just me leanna and Erik
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Per usual, snowballed
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): Neato
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's ok I have BNE muted all the time too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _no apologies this is good thing_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have most channels on BNE muted lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im assuming thor, cap, and loki are taken?
Bill: Iiiiis Gen involved?
Bill: If not then Loki available.
Bill: Thor and Cap are Georgia Leanna.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Monica mentioned doing Loki
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because I think she already does him
Bill: Well, she already does Loki.
Bill: Yeah.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So far we got Leanna as captain America, me as thor, Erik as widow, Anna as Bucky, Rebecca as strange, Monica as Loki
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mawisa did you wanna do rocket?
N🆗ri (Marisa): if no one else wants to do him
Aldus Larian (Jess): Opp ok then.  have the fun peeps
Aldus Larian (Jess): Stange or bucky would have been my next to ask about XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): i could do thanos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dfgfdgdfgfdsg
N🆗ri (Marisa): not avenger tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): 💪
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OMFG THO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): DO THANOS
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao do thanos
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess u do rocket?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no
Bill: Marisa be the furry you want to be.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dont really have an interest in cosplaying him i sowwy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jess be Antman and Tom be Wasp
Aldus Larian (Jess): We havent seen it 😬
Bill: lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Neither have I lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~rocket is easier to make and put on than thanos but i don't mind being whatever~~ <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's on netflix i think
Bill: *Be what you want to be*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Its fine guys, im not bigmon genderbends for myself anyway
N🆗ri (Marisa): b a r b i e
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna fill in whatever people are missing because other people cosplay better and i can help complete an otherwise incomplete group 👍
Bill: Hush you are rocket raccoon.
Bill: I will kill anyone who tries to be rocket instead of you.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Little extreme but be a *little* selfish damnit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): can we just have a whole army of rockets being sassy to each other
Bill: As long as you are one of them
N🆗ri (Marisa): if we get a hoarde of rockets i'll be thanos in clunky armor waving my hand at them
Bill: Cap Marvel is good and snarky but like. Bodysuits. And I dunno if I care that much.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): could do leather jacket or something
Bill: Thought bout that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dont feel pressured into doing it though, maybe being in the group will make you more inclined but you absolutely arent required to cosplay to be in on the fun
Bill: True.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ideas for dudes
Bill: WAIT AMINUTE
Bill: Jessica Jones.
Bill: Snarky bourbon drinking alcohol, it’s already me.
Bill: Also my think against shooting would be that I don’t want to responsible for the group as a whole’s photos. I have more fun doing solos or small groups where I get time to work with the people.
Bill: If I’m not the only photog I can do my think.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we will figure it out as it gets closer
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): for right now we just figuring out whos doing who and... starting making the coslays xD
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow can't believe eraserhead is in the marvel universe
Bill: Easily could have Hunter shooting and if I actually make good on this photographer community can bond with more that way.
Bill: But Jessica Jones is tempting.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): true hunter might be interested in it/we could pay him
Bill: Watch me dump a bottle of cheap bourbon and fill it with good bourbon so I can wander around drinking from a bottle.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ill drink the cheap shit
Bill: I can think of a few other people too, and it’s mostly to split the load.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dont waste that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Bill: Iiii meant for the photography.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fair
Aldus Larian (Jess): *does 1 free-lance job*
*Remembers why I don't freelance*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh wow thats a fucking mood
Aldus Larian (Jess):
