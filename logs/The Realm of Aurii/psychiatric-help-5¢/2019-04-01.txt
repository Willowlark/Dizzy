Bill: Take my 5¬¢, I truly need psychiatric help. 

Anna almost has me wanting to look at my old sketchbooks.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Draw! Draw! Draw!
Aldus Larian (Jess): My old sketchbooks make.me feel either embarrassed of how bad they are or jelaous of past me for being better at things
NüÜóri (Marisa): You should draw more and show old you who‚Äôs boss
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): I bought a tablet that alot of artists recommend for cheaper alternative to the fancy Wacom ones and it's commingled tomorrow so hopefully that will help me get back in the groove
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wooo nice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Is it like an actual screen tablet or just one that hooks up to your computer?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Actual screen
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Noice
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have a drawing tablet but I can't get used to the disconnect not seeing my drawing under my pen
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah it's challenging
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What tablet did you get?
Aldus Larian (Jess): The Samsung Galaxy tab a with s pen, a co-worker recommend it to me cuz she got one a few months ago for drawing and likes it alot, alot of artists say it's pretty decent so I'mma give it a shot
Bill: Ooooh I tried that once. I had like, the first generation of the Samsung pen tablets. Good idea.
Bill: Also WOO MORE ARTING.
Bill: Explore those hobbies.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm really hoping it works out ü§û
Bill: Is the one you have the old wacom I ~~pawned off~~ gave you?
Bill: Or did you toss that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You gave me a Wacom?
Bill: I thought I did.
Bill: But the drivers didn‚Äôt work or something.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You gave us a tablet keyboard
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't remember a Wacom tablet <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Bill: I gave the bamboo to someone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The one I have is Tom's that his grandparents got him for his birthday like 8 years ago
Bill: Who‚Äôd I give the bamboo to then.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Itsamystery.jpg
Aldus Larian (Jess): What color was it?
Bill: Grey.
Bill: Shitty cable connection.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ours is grey but def from Tom's grandparents, Marisa has the same one
Bill: I could have swore I gave it to you...
Bill: Oh well.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Perhaps you gave it to your future self who is an astounding da Vinci
Bill: You haven‚Äôt seen my deviantart have you.
NüÜóri (Marisa): üëÄ 
You‚Äôve been hiding a gold mine from us??
Bill: I‚Äôm it hiding it.
Bill: You just don‚Äôt know where it is.
NüÜóri (Marisa): dark internet share is the deviantart
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do you guys remember last spring when that group of girls kicked me out of their suite so I joined the suite I‚Äôm in now?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Apparently Noah tutors the girl that messaged me asking me to leave
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Double crazy, that girls dad is super important in the Rutgers nuclear physics department
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The world is too small for me sometimes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Forreal
NüÜóri (Marisa): Aww man Greg don‚Äôt be startin this drama at bedtime man. Wait until everyone is awake.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like how you still just refer to him as Greg
NüÜóri (Marisa): Nicknames are forever <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): (now it just looks like hes copying meg)
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Dont know if thats true, its just what it looks like :/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOW
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He even private messaged me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah‚Äôs laughing cause he thought Hal dumped me cause he was gay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI WAS ALMOST RIGHT‚Äù
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HE AND MEG BROKE UP TOO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow that full Tellonym is RUDE
Bill: He grossly overestimates how much people gossip about him. I could care less whatever he is, whatever floats his boat.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sorry, not sorry, but "my faith in your understanding the end of our relationship is still slim to none" is quite possibly one of the rudest sentences ever conceived
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He's acting as though you're the jealous ex girlfriend who isn't over him and is spreading blatant lies about your breakup...
Bill: He‚Äôs always had a bit of an ego. Yes get arrogant with me back when he was in this server ~~and get shut down~~ too.
Bill: But. *ready for it.* Who am I to judge; guys aromantic, is broke, probably failing school again, no career, and a handful o toxic personality traits and he‚Äôs had two (2) girlfriends in recent years. A) I‚Äôm somehow worse than all that, or B) looks really are all that matters to getting a foot in the door.

Bill: There‚Äôs probably a lesson in that somewhere cause lord knows I give a lot lectures. It I‚Äôm just blowing off steam.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damn Hal,that's extremely rude
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and again i don't understand his level of defensiveness
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's like hes having an argument with himself
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but is just sending it to a bunch of other people for validation
Bill: Hal sees BNE specifically as a line of people laughing about him.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye he's really defense about it when BNE is full of a wide variety of LGBT and around/ace spectrum people like... I.e. the last group you need to be worried about judging you based on that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think his concern is more that he doesn't want it becoming another rumor as to why he broke up with Georgia
Bill: ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tru
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but he's still being *very* defensive about it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also.... Georgia understanding is slim to none cuz he never fucking explained himself to her.
Bill: T r u
Bill: He‚Äôs always going to be defensive with BNE cause it‚Äôs Georgia‚Äôs friend group now and he doesn‚Äôt feel welcome,even if he wants to.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also true
Bill: Hell never really get the chance to fix that either... cons too busy, he can‚Äôt fix it online, he won‚Äôt get invites to off con things...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I thought that first sentence was hella rude too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like dude why would I still give a heck ya know
Glonk: Heckin heck
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): how do i even respond?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): noah said to leave him on read for a week and then go "oh i didnt see this"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Read 2:27AM*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Honestly, I feel like leaving on read might not actually be a bad idea, because I feel like any sort of retaliation might come off as hostile and spark something worse
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, tbh i would leave him on read
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): at least until he's less hostile
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or passive aggressive thumbs up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): actually probably don't do that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because right now it seems like hes trying to look for a fight that just isnt there lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeaaaah youre right
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): a fight is still attention
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): even if its negative attention
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i thought something like "thanks for the heads up, but no ones talked about our break up in months." wouldve been fitting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but you right imma leave him on read
Aldus Larian (Jess): He might also see leaving him on read as a type of retaliation also tho <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Yeaaaah ghosting is far worse cause it lets him imagine the response.
Bill: Which would likely be you running around to everyone in BNE, showing them the message, laughing about the tea, planning a prank on him, undermining his friendships...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'd say
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): make a comment
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): in BNE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so you're not ignoring him
Bill: * which being his imagination
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but also not feeding in to him talking about your breakup again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ugh that first line was so aggressive i wanna bop him
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's smart
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): especially after that first sentance >.>
Bill: You... can, tell him you were offended by his words.
Bill: You just have to be careful about it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i want to murder him with my own words_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so whats the good compormise lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe something along the lines of "Thank you for letting me know, however I don't appreciate that you assume I don't understand the reasoning for our breakup. You made it clear that it was for [X reasons] and if your being aro had nothing to do with that, then it wasn't. I would also appreciate it if you would stop bringing things up about our breakup as it happened several months ago and we have both since moved on."
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ugh erik thats so eloquent and nice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): much nicer than anything i wouldve drafted
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho still kinda savage
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'd leave him on read if it were me, or fight him but that's prob not the best option
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like you should at least reaffirm with him that you know his reasoning for breaking up and also that it is in the past and you've both moved on
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): is it too rude to tell him that no ones talked about our break up in months so hes being paranoid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): a little
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _probably is huh_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeahhhh
Glonk: I wouldn't think it's rude, can't keep dwelling on the past or think people are constantly bringing it up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would at least not mention the paranoid part
Bill: Yeah. If you tell not as a dig, but as an affirmation so he can take soulice in it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~i dont want him taking solace~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): eriks draft is probably right
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ill leave him on read a little longer while i get my work done today and then use eriks response later today
Bill: Even his draft is a bit hard edged. But. You‚Äôve yet to set your boundaries about him with him.
Bill: Maybe it‚Äôs time you did that.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think theyve kinda become de facto politely ignoring each other
Bill: Draw them in the sand so there‚Äôs no assumption. Better for him and better for you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so add to eriks paragraph by saying... what?
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Thank you for letting me know, I'm glad that you are coming to terms with who you truly are, I've struggled to understand exactly why our break up happened but i know understand it was [for x reasons]. I think we both have some to terms with what happened and would like to propose no longer talking about or bringing up the breakup unnecessarily so that we both might obtain some closure."
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~if u thought eriks was nice u gon hate mine~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok imma frankenstein the two together
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thank you for letting me know, I'm glad that you are coming to terms with who you truly are. That‚Äôs basically the point of dating, to figure out more about yourself and others. However I will say that I don't appreciate your assumption that I don't understand the reasoning for our breakup. You made it clear that it was for [X reasons]. If that has nothing to do with your sexual identity, then it doesn‚Äôt, plain and simple. Also, as it has been months since the break up, everyone has stopped talking about it, and both of us have moved on to better things. There is no need to keep rehashing why it  happened, all that matters is that we both learned from it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thoughts????
Bill: it's good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i think it may still sounds a lil hostile but im a peacekeeper ‚Ñ¢~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): to be fair, his was hostile
Bill: At this point Georgia needs to be a little hostile.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i will say, technically aro is a romantic orientation so maybe just drop the "sexual" part so he can't fire back at you for not "understanding"
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea im just more in the arena of diffusing the bomb rather than letting him blow up
Bill: she's not peacekeeping anymore, hasn't been for a long time, and in a private conversation she can be a little more straight.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I didnt say she couldnt/shouldnt fight back, i was just giving my personal opinion, since it was asked for
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oooo good catch leanna
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye i appreciate the marketplace of ideas goin on right now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think what i wrote is the right balance of sounding like myself, being straightforward and truthful, and giving a little pushback
Aldus Larian (Jess): hal is a lit fuse, if u wanna fight, fight just be ready for him to fight back
Bill: I‚Äôm not saying your wrong, I‚Äôm saying my thoughts.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): whats the most aggressive part of what i wrote tbh? which is most likely for him to come at me?
Bill: No idea.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i would say the "I don't appreciate" part
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): "both of us have moved on to better things. " that sounds the most aggressive tbh but like... whats he gonna say, that its not true? üòè
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the general tone of it is aggressive, but i don't think its too much
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its more like youre setting boundaries
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and done playing games
Aldus Larian (Jess): literally
Aldus Larian (Jess): (league)
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): TLDR of it is "great, thanks for letting me know you found yourself. But, i'm done talking about our breakup and this has nothing to do with it, so please drop it"
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh but yea switch sexual to romantic so he cant call u out on not getting it like leanna said
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I did
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think that‚Äôs the tone I‚Äôm going for Leanna
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, it works
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would say if he starts to fight back you can just say "I'm not discussing this further" and if he keeps pressing you can break out the "Please stop talking to me"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if he decides to fight, i think thats his own insecurities that he needs to deal with on his own.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and if that leads to his ass getting blocked....
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:5142_then_perish:554720548274569246>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I feel like I can be a little aggressive in tone cause he is the whole time he sent the message?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And like, he didn‚Äôt have to be?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, definitely
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you're matching his energy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but also being respectful and not just rude about it, so i still think you are taking the high road
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The funny part of this is, way back when, he said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù firSt LMAOOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/fandom-i-did-a-thing-why-you-always-lying-jMS9a9pYesZnW
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anyways yeah I‚Äôll send that later today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If he gets impatient that‚Äôs his own fault
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if he gets impatient you can just say you needed time to think how to respond
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~I need to study, unlike, ya know, public policy majors~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but he's having fun and doing touristy shit in London so he shouldn't be worrying about your response
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hal stop worrying about this bullshit and go met girls in bars in downtown london
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or boys ‚òù
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~shit u right~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): In other news
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Who saw the him and meg thing happening
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/hand-raise-karen-smith-amanda-seyfried-gif-7717611
Bill: Being on vacation doesn't mean you don't worry about messages~~
Bill: When I was in Canada I spent half the time stressing one.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i knew that wasnt gonna last
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the second i heard they were dating i was like :
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 3 months was Hal‚Äôs batting average before me so he‚Äôs gone back to that I guess
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): 3 months is that standard amount of time it takes people to start seeing flaws
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wonder who dumped who with hal and meg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôd bet my money one way but idk if that‚Äôs the reality
Aldus Larian (Jess): hal seemed alot more interested in her than she seemed in him but i cant say for sure
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): agreed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üê∏üçµ
Aldus Larian (Jess): frog tea
NüÜóri (Marisa): Do you think this is maybe a big messed up April fools joke
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah i dont think so but lol

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Haha April fool's right?!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hoho Greg's so funny

NüÜóri (Marisa): What else would you do in a perfectly good afternoon in a foreign country
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): why explore when you can just sit down and play endless hours of LoL
Aldus Larian (Jess): hal plz
Glonk: Sometimes you just gotta play games
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hal isn't Zen...
*he's Yoosung*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If I start playing now I guarantee irregardless of his angry message he would ask me to play
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!184437198865563648> you didn't post your Monday work post in your story today <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>

Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Introvert is low.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WONDER WHY
Aldus Larian (Jess): whenever my friends exes like my post im like <:lenny:395307171539189760> üó°
