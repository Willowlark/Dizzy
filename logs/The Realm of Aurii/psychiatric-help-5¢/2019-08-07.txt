Nokri (Marisa): lol
Nokri (Marisa): It just keeps getting better
Nokri (Marisa): Hacker voice im in
All the sidewalks and roads are flooded, we couldn’t see while driving
Nokri (Marisa): The meeting with the mayor seemed to go very well though and my therapist sprayed someone with mace which was interesting
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm glad your meeting went well tho.
Nokri (Marisa): Ye
So I was sitting in the lobby while the doctor closed up and it was just us two in the building and some guy who was shaking with red eyes came in saying he needed help. We thought he was crying at first so she said “we’re closing for the day, what help do you need?” and he said he just needed an iPhone charger or some money. Got continually more aggressive and started shouting when we said we didn’t have anything and he wouldn’t leave so she took out her mace and got him. Didn’t have too much of an effect, he was probably on meth or something since mace doesn’t affect people on certain drugs, but it got him to leave. He was about to harass a lady next door leaving the pizza place until a car drove up and scared him off.
Nokri (Marisa): Apparently they’re common in the area, they hang around the 400 club in the same shopping plaza and harass people all the time
Nokri (Marisa): When we went out there were two more like him wandering in the parking lot
Bill: Your therapist is a badass owo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OMG NO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah good job therapist
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn son
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Scary 😬
Nokri (Marisa): I didn’t have any mace but I had some blade 🔪 e
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh yee you always got the blade
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Marisa the great will always stab someone for us if she had too 🙏
Nokri (Marisa): Flashback to Otakon bag check lady, “you’re fine, I don’t think you have any knives or explosives with you.”
<:lenny:395307171539189760>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): *fool*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I mean look at your avatar,there's at least 14 knives in those sleeves let's be real
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like that girl from monogatari
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I don't know much about monogatari but I know that one girl has knives and scissors and stuff
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo in her skirt!! Yeah!
Nokri (Marisa): New cosplay. Gotta make it accurate.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Trips and 32 knivesfall out, "eheheheh I can explain"
