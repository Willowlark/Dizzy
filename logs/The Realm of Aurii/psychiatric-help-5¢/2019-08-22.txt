Bill: And I still haven't had a really good night's sleep in the apartment...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ahhhhh my dad switched the tickets so we would be flying for 7.5 hours
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m sick of running around and told my mom I’m not coming
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s upset but she gets it, and if there’s bad weather Sunday I won’t make it to work on time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm so tired of doing quotes for customers 😩
Bill: You got any sick days/time off to spare? You definitely need a mental health day.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have one vacation day left and 2 personal days
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn son
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That's not including conventions I'm assuming
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): well, technically 2 vacation days left because I haven't requested off for CCE yet
Nokri (Marisa): Biru it’s gonna be a while before you have a good nights sleep in the apartment. It’s a new place that you’ve never been to before, your body is gonna take a few weeks to adjust to it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooooh finally under a month until I'm in mine
Bill: Mmm, You right Marisa. Had slept better monday or tuesday but it didn't last.
Nokri (Marisa): There’s a mysterious bag in the backyard and someone’s been messing with our fence again aaaa
Nokri (Marisa): Now taking guesses on what this could possibly be
Aldus Larian (Jess): garbage? 😮
Aldus Larian (Jess): hopefully not a dead animal
Nokri (Marisa): omg it looks too bulky for a dead animal I hope not
Nokri (Marisa): Dirt and sand <:rise:582318089228648456>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh boy
Nokri (Marisa): It’s a big bag of dirt and sand and hopefully nothing else wooooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): that so weird
Aldus Larian (Jess): my boss said i had good ideas in the meeting <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): You’re the boss now!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): god i wish
Aldus Larian (Jess): he said something else i took offence too but i dont remeber what it was
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh he said "trumps a very smart guy" that was hard to keep a straight face for
El🆓de Faun (Tom): My dad says that every day of his life xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooooh I'll bust out my moonshine. let's get individually lit tonight fam
Nokri (Marisa): ***what?***
Aldus Larian (Jess): *nice*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: So I hate one of the neighbors. Like. Much fury. But the fury you smile the whole time. Older woman, hasn’t done anything to me. Handicapped, some kind of walking issue my guess. Which whatever right, I don’t judge. 

But she does. She does. First day I moved in mom parked in the handicap spot at the apartment. There are two. She has real trouble walking and doing stairs with her knee. You know, the kind of person handicap spots are for. 

This *bitch* pulls up next to the car. Goes into her trunk. Pulls out a handwritten note saying “these spots are for residents only” (they’re not, we checked with management) and that she’s “being kind by not getting the police involved” (a handicapped person has. EVERY right to park there, all a cop will do is tell bitch she’s wrong). We can see her do this from my apartment window. 

I’ve seen her twice in person now. She introduced herself as *”Miss Pam* which, I mean, fuck off, I’m 26. I’ve left both meaningless “hi neighbor” encounters with a strong “punch you in the teeth” feeling because mom now feels awkward about parking in the spaces there when she really should be parking there and mom wants me to play nice with her (which is the thing to do but) and.
Bill: So anyway. I wanna punch a bitch in the teeth.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ye she seems a bit rude
Bill: It’s always the same two cars in the spots too. Which leads me to believe she thinks handicap means reserved parking spot. That’s not it you bitch.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And you're sure it's not? I saw at my complex, some of the handicapped spots had apartment numbers on the signs reserving it to those residents
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Doesn't excuse her being a rude ass old lady though
Bill: I spoke to the assistant manager of the entire complex.
Bill: There are absolutely no reserved spots.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ah
