Nokri (Marisa): Our office literally goes through one lifeguard a week. Usually for behavior issues or such but today’s was interesting.
Nokri (Marisa): the person who was supposed to train her never trained her, so when people came to use the pool she had them write down the time instead of their house number. people can bring guests to use the pool for like $5 a day or such, and the money gets put in an envelope.
when they went to collect the envelope today, it was all disorganized like the money had been thrown in there instead of counted as it went in. The bills were all crumpled and whatnot. so the secretary on duty takes it all out and starts flattening it out. there was a rolled up $5 bill and when she opened it, a bunch of cocaine fell out.
Nokri (Marisa): so that new lifeguard will probably be fired
Nokri (Marisa): yup there goes the order to fire her.
i get that she wasn't trained so she didn't know what to do, but. if your job includes taking money, isn't kind of common sense to count the money when you get it? or confirm that it's real? or at least put it away properly? she wasn't a teenager she was older than me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): oof
El🆓de Faun (Tom): big oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): everyone's real suspicious now, they think someone might be trying to frame the office
El🆓de Faun (Tom): whatttttheeefuckk
Nokri (Marisa): like, who stores cocaine in wadded up bills of cash (the paper absorbs the powder so it's the worst storage container) and who gives it away without immediately realizing they just gave it away and coming back for it
from what i heard, it was a pretty decent amount for being wadded up in a five dollar bill
some people think someone was trying to frame the housing association as a drug front and try to use that bill as proof
Bill: Lol Anna recruited another one to the marvel group.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Have made it to Cleveland
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Went to check into our room at the hostel and only one bed was available. Turned out someone was in the wrong room so they had to wake everyone up in the room to figure out who wasn't supposed to be there
Nokri (Marisa): o yikes that sucks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Everything got sorted out though
Bill: Looking at two apartments and a condo today. Let’s see what happens. I’m not in a rush, but it’d be nice to have a clear picture of what it’ll run me moving out.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Indiana smells like Pennsylvania
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Weird
Bill: First place is pretty nice but they said the prices are really high right now and to wait till fall.
Bill: WOW glad I looked at other places cause the original place sucks.
Nokri (Marisa): it's a bit odd they asked you to wait for the price to fall, that sounds shady
Bill: They were telling us how market price works so we can save money.
Bill: First place was nice.
Nokri (Marisa): what's the difference between original place and first place
Bill: Oh so much.
Bill: I’m on route to look at something else but so oof.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yes apartment prices always go down in the fall
Nokri (Marisa): so you're saying

Kaio Vermino (Lee): ..... I'm not usually one to do drugs but since I'm in Colorado i decided to try recreational weed because it's legal here. 

Boy was that a mistake. I took it at 9 30pm last night and I'm STILL feeling weird
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I also took 45 selfies last night.... and started tweeting about yipper ( yang as a zipper)
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ahhhhaaaaa how do people function normally like this??? I'm really so scared of humans now
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YIpper oh man
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I tried to go to sleep last night and ended up in a OCD cycle
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And coulent fall asleep until like 4 am
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): How do people do this
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I have nothing to input in this but I will add your experience to the ol don't do drugs bank
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea dont do drugs kids
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I always kinda wondered, I feel like it'd give me a panic attack ngl,
Nokri (Marisa): They take it so often they get used to it and find real life to be the scary thing
El🆓de Faun (Tom): When they used laughing gas on me for my wisdom teeth surgery I almost had a panic attack
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I'm kinda having a panic attack now
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I sat up and gasped for air
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Because the effects wont go away
El🆓de Faun (Tom): They will I'm sure!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And I'm just like trying to eat freaking McDonalds in peace and I feel like I'm floating
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yall. Dont. Do. Drugs. 🚓 🚓 🚓 🚓
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I know caffeines half life is actually 24hrs so I won't be surprised if it takes a full 2 days
Nokri (Marisa): It stays in your system for a few days that’s normal
But never ever do it again or I’m calling the police
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But it should be mostly gone soon
Bill: Don’t panic, it will fade... or else pot heads wouldn’t constantly be in need of a dealer.
Nokri (Marisa): (I’m not really gonna call the police on you we love u)
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I love you toooo
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But oof. Experiment fail.
Bill: Did you smoke or eat?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Eat
Kaio Vermino (Lee): 1 gummie
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~she can't call the police anyway it's not illegal in CO~~
Nokri (Marisa): Eating em is way stronger than smokin em
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea I've heard those are serious business
Bill: Aaaah that’s it. I was told in college weed eaten is way more potent and lasts longer than smoked.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ... she technically can because I'm in new Mexico currently
Bill: Though they ate brownies.
Nokri (Marisa): You’re like a celebrity, traveling the country while high
Nokri (Marisa): That’s what celebrities do right
Bill: Lol true.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Incredible. I think I'll stick to alcohol from now on though
Bill: 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
