Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So the bridge of my new glasses is shaped like this so those 2 sharper curves are digging into my nose, causing me discomfort
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm trying to file them down so they're not digging in as much
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm in this rut of wanting to get so much shit done but also wanting to not do shit at all and I hate it
Nokri (Marisa): if there's something really pressing, count down to do it
if it can be pushed off... until later... then... <:rapid:607237006539489310> 

but don't be like "i'm going to do this in 5 minutes" or "i'm gonna do that at 2:30." you gotta be like "ok. I'm sitting here, and in 10 seconds I'm gonna get in my car and drive to walmart and buy a single tomato. 10... 9... 8..."
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Most of it is "I need to clear a path so I can walk in my room" and stuff like that but I wind up lying on my bed looking at my phone for hours
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or I put on a movie in the background while I try to do something else productive and then I end up just watching the movie
Nokri (Marisa): oooooooooo the path is a mood. rip
Nokri (Marisa): watch psychedelic yule fireplace it's the best movie
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just put Guardians of the Galaxy on <:rip:369476083248267274>

El🆓de Faun (Tom): They thicc bois
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I have a bad habit of
Sending messages
One bit
At a
Time
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But it's so much more dramatic
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): when you type stuff with
like
pauses and whatnot?
it's. the same as this. but... more drama
Nokri (Marisa): so intense
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Send
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Each
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Separately
Nokri (Marisa): exactly
it keeps people on the edge of their seats in suspense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Guardians of the Galaxy is over. Now I can start to get stuff done for the day
Nokri (Marisa): ~~did you know there's a sequel~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I do~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I'm doing a productive thing now!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): sort of
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm spending dollars
Nokri (Marisa): *taxpayer money*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm buying a battery replacement kit for my tablet since it ded
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I'm *guessing* it's the battery since it won't even turn on to charge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not sure what happened to it. I went to go use it one day and it just wouldn't turn on
Nokri (Marisa): oh nooooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I might have had it plugged in too long and it fried the battery?
Nokri (Marisa): **is that a thing that can happen** screams
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm pretty sure leaving your devices charging too much kills the battery
Nokri (Marisa): time to go unplug **everything**
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my old laptop suffered a similar fate
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I got a new battery for that one. but then my charging port started to crap out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but then I got a new laptop!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my first laptop was part of a scholarship for college so it was free and had a 4 year warranty on it. Had to have it serviced twice. First time I fried part of the motherboard from a static discharge into the fingerprint sensor. My keyboard stopped working and replacing the keyboard didn't work. Second time there was something wrong with my fan and it made this awful grinding noise.
Nokri (Marisa): fingerprint sensor!! <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah it was this little rectangular sensor you'd swipe your finger over to unlock your computer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I went to do it on a cold, dry, winter day after right after taking off my jacket, the friction creating a static charge that discharged right into my computer <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it zapped my computer off and when I turned it back on, my keyboard didn't work. luckily I had an external keyboard I could use
Nokri (Marisa): that's a superpowe
Nokri (Marisa): rr
Nokri (Marisa): that's shazam
Nokri (Marisa): you're shazam
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:woah:543194447345876998>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So i know that was a thing that used to happen but i read most chargers nowadays have a workaround so it essentially stops charging it after its full
El🆓de Faun (Tom): thisis all hearsay so idk if anyof it is actually true
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's a 4 year old tablet so idk when that went into effect. But yeah I notice with my phone, once it hits 100%, the charging icon stops
Bill: Yeah it’s not an issue anymore I think.
