Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *sigh*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hold on, there's a rant about a customer coming up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok so *for a while now* there has been a part on one of our customer's assemblies that has gone obsolete (went obsolete in like 2015/2016). We finally ran out of what we had in stock for that part and we're trying to explain to the customer that we can no longer get the part. Blah blah blah there's a lot of confusion about what the part number is because they're claiming it's a different part number. Turns out when they made the revision change *back in 2016* they never changed the part number on the BOM they sent *us*. But, and here's the kicker, the part it was *allegedly* changed to isn't even the correct size and not meant for the wire gauge we're supposed to be using.

I was on the phone with their buyer who I think also had one of their engineers there trying to help out as well. I can hear their buyer, kind of a condescending German guy, saying *"I'm sure I'm right..."* and meanwhile I'm thinking *I'm sure you fucking aren't...*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): From what their engineer said, it sounded like their BOM was updated with the "substitute" part mere days after they sent us the "new" BOM so it never got the change
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but the change is a wrong sized connector anyway
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And then another customer is getting antsy about some quotes that they requested last week (which no one filled in for me for while I was gone, so had that to come back to)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and they sent even more on top of that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and there's another big quote my boss was going to work on but then decided to give to me when I came back
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and another smaller quote
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I have a few dozen assembly procedures to make
Aldus Larian (Jess): dude just burn the whole building down at the point
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I want to die
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I know I've been dicking around on Discord quite a bit, but at this point I'm just so overwhemled I can't concentrate
Bill: Eh, breaks are good for you.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and once I start concentrating on something someone pulls me away to check something or ask questions
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): don't go on vacation kids
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because no one covers for you and you'll just have twice the work to come back to
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and my boss has been sort of hinting at me to work overtime and I'm just like nah
