Bill: I'm sure he meant no harm by it.
Bill: Whatever it is.
Bill: He's just that thick headed.
Nokri (Marisa): thicker head means you just need something blunt

Nokri (Marisa): ~~it's certainly an option if you wanna crack someone's thick skull tho~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *creeps into the chat*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): O.O
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Basically started with AccentKisses posting a link about being careful about posting Amazon wish lists because if the item if from a 3rd party seller, it sometimes sends a confirmation to the person who bought it for you, with your info
Peter made a comment alluding to getting a gun for self defense
Blew up into an "I shouldn't have to defend myself. People should just not be shitty" argument
Bill: Yeah, that sounds exactly like Peter.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh whoa
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I wouldn't consider owning. Firearm insensitive tho
Bill: Gun control is a hot button issue between left and right leaning people.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you wouldnt but anti gun advocates would
Bill: Peter a conservative, most people in the con world lean left.
Bill: While it shouldn't be an issue to discuss, it's not a smart idea to bring it up.
Bill: Like the old saying says, don't discuss politics or religion in polite company
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was less of a gun control argument as it was a "people shouldn't rape/stalk/hurt/kill anyone for existing" argument
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I mean yeah ofc wouldn't everyone agree on that?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo like 
"Hey guys watch out for creeps"
"you wouldnt have to worry about creeps of you had a gun"
"Well yea but i shouldnt have to go that far"
?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): True that would make sense
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I see it now
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That totally could happen
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And is probably what did happy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Peter was prob underhandedly referencing that others should buy guns too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): "that's why I own protection" or something
Bill: yeah.
Tikur (Kurtis): Y'all this patienta pink eye mixed with another infection and became pink eyes badass grandma.  It's so bad it has epidemic in the name
