Bill: I need CCE to be relaxing. 

If it窶冱 not tacky cardy syndrome, which is a rare thing and unlikely, but getting a test for this weekend, I pretty much caused myself to pass out via anxiety according to the cardiologist. Mom thinks I might have had a panic attack over the high heart rate which triggered the drop. 

So I need to relax at CCE.
