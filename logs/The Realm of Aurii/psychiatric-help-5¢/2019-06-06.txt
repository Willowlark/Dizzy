Bill: ohhhhh noooo my dear sweet intern; his name is Anand and *he's in the channel you're asking in*
Bill: DMs 👏 exist 👏 for a 👏 Reason!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LMAO
Bill: ~~no wait I'm wrong whose the idiot now~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yes Dungeon Masters exist to keep gameplay structured and keep the story rolling <:pew:543202259085950996>
N👌kri (Marisa): ~~hunter shouldn't be breaking the rules to give attendees badges aaa~~
Bill: ~~I don't want to stand in line though~~
N👌kri (Marisa): but that's the whole purpose of a line. he's abusing his power as staff.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but then he wants people to help bag books <:pew:543202259085950996>
N👌kri (Marisa): that's a staff job
N👌kri (Marisa): that's something he should be doing instead of making people skip the line
N👌kri (Marisa): it's like walking into starbucks and the barista goes "hey, you can be served first but i need you to clean all the tables"
N👌kri (Marisa): unprofessional for a corporation
Bill: I don't think he's actually going to force anyone to bag stuff.
Bill: He'll just do the badges.
Bill: So it's more like walking into starbucks and they start making your drink while you're in the line cause they know what you're ordering.
Bill: Which I see happen.
N👌kri (Marisa): but in that case you still have to wait in line
N👌kri (Marisa): in that scenario it'd be fine ~~but also what if you want a different drink and they waste ingredients~~
Bill: Not if you paid in advance, like on the app (or in this case prereg).
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's like mobile ordering <:pew:543202259085950996>
N👌kri (Marisa): thursday is prereg only, everyone will have purchased ahead of time so it's not fair to everyone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): already paid for, you walk in, grab it without talking to anyone,. and leave
N👌kri (Marisa): that's the pre-reg line!
N👌kri (Marisa): i'm just salty because he shouldn't be doing it
Aldus Larian (Jess): and if u miss prereg you can appartly pick up your badge at con ops
Bill: You're just to pure and good for the world Mawisa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): das what it says on the email i got today anyway
N👌kri (Marisa): ye that was odd it does say that
Bill: Hmm. I doubt that applies to tonight. Only say so because there's no programming beyond prereg tonight.
Bill: The late pick up is usually for people who come late friday after reg closes while the con is still going on.
N👌kri (Marisa): con ops is always open, it opens on like wednesday. usually attendees aren't allowed there though
Bill: oh wow.
Bill: Didn't know that.
N👌kri (Marisa): ye it's literally where the con is run
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just killed a smol spidery thing. almost thought it was a tick at first. grabbed it with a tissue and squeezed it and it POPPED and it grossed me
Bill: now I'm grossed out 🤢
Aldus Larian (Jess): bleh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh whoops I didn’t pre reg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sucks to suck lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): womp
N👌kri (Marisa): w h a t
Kaio Vermino (Lee): lobby con it until you need to do something with a badge
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Should’ve pre reg’d but it really just slipped my mind
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow 75 bucks for a badge at door
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I know I should’ve paid in advance but cons are really jacking up prices since I started attending
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I remember when AnimeNEXT was like 46
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s weird, going to cons long enough to see con culture evolve
N👌kri (Marisa): ye it was like $40 for prereg, $55 at the door in 2011
N👌kri (Marisa): my first zenkai was $25
N👌kri (Marisa): wait no, $20 according to the site history
Kaio Vermino (Lee): omfg anext is 75$???????????
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): otas like what 90?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yea and thats fucking crazy
N👌kri (Marisa): over $100 depending on when you buy
Kaio Vermino (Lee): my wallet burned buying my ota pass
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why are cons amping up prices so bad like wtf
N👌kri (Marisa): that one's always been pretty pricy though, it was in the $60s when i first started going
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 85 when I went to Otakon in 2012
N👌kri (Marisa): whaaa
Kaio Vermino (Lee): nothing has changed in the programming so idk why theyre so much money, unless the venue rent is going up which is entirely possible
Bill: Ota has always been pricey yeah.
Bill: Ota moved to DC, that could change rates.
Bill: ~~Otakon is for profit too~~
N👌kri (Marisa): guest prices, venue, staff accommodations
N👌kri (Marisa): yeah otakon is for profit. they did a lot more in baltimore though, like the thursday matsuri and they rented out the football stadium
N👌kri (Marisa): or baseball
N👌kri (Marisa): whatever stadium
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If I ever get rich I’m making a con that’s totally cosplay focused 😭
N👌kri (Marisa): it exists and it's horribly elitist
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause im basically paying 75 to go to the formal, rave, and buy shit
Kaio Vermino (Lee): :/
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Guests probably eat into the budget a lot which is understandable but I usually don’t care for whoever they get
Bill: ~~so Katsu~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH IM MAKING KATSU
Kaio Vermino (Lee): yeaaaa same lmao
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i also just am not personally awestruck by  "celebrities"
N👌kri (Marisa): one of the cosplay-focused cons is around the same time as zenkaikon, from what i've heard/seen of it it's incredibly elitist and competitive? handmade costumes in the thousands of dollars
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oof?????
Kaio Vermino (Lee): where?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Katsu can get a little elitist too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If there wasn’t that undercurrent of partying lol
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ^
Kaio Vermino (Lee): a lot of big cons are hella elitist on the surface
N👌kri (Marisa): i honestly can't remember what it's called aaaa i'll ask penny or dizzy this weekend if i see them, they go to it
N👌kri (Marisa): it's up north
N👌kri (Marisa): imagine katsu but 100x more pompous and stuck-up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’d want a con with like the formal and rave, and the cosplay museum Zenkai had, and lots of meet ups
Bill: C2E2.
Bill: Ginny goes.
N👌kri (Marisa): animenext has the museum too!
N👌kri (Marisa): c2e2?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): meanwhile CCE is only $50 for the badge ~~but a shit ton more for th ehotel~~
N👌kri (Marisa): that's the chicago comic con right?
N👌kri (Marisa): c2e2
Aldus Larian (Jess): CCE was likw 35 2 years ago
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless thats just hte time based thing
N👌kri (Marisa): the costuming con i'm thinking of is essentially 75% masquerade, it lasts all day
Bill: Kalahari has a great group rate.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): how many people for a group rate though
Bill: CCE is the same cost as Ota and Next and you get the water park included.
Bill: You get shafted on the extra person fees though.
Bill: C2E2 is the cosplay con.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Otakon is pretty bunk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hotel and con is expense
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): AnimeNEXT it’s both too by otakons tickets are like 100
N👌kri (Marisa): that's not it <:thinku:543194478614413318> might be another one but that's a comic con
Bill: <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: ~~why do we have three think emotes~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): we do alot of thinkin
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We smart like that
Bill: I'm not adult enough to have actual life insurance.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): darn, ethan can't take anymore selfies
Bill: eyyyyy
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol
N👌kri (Marisa): I see a lot of people I know and worked with but they don’t remember me ;-;
N👌kri (Marisa): I’ve waved to several people I’ve known for several years and they don’t wave back, just look confused, and I straight up greeted and asked dizzy a question when she was chatting with megs group and she responded to the question but I don’t think she likes me ;-;
Aldus Larian (Jess): whos dizzy?
Dizzy: me!
Bill: !ghost me!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LOL
Bill: You aren't in cosplay right now right?
Bill: Maybe they can't recognize you out of cosplay.
N👌kri (Marisa): Dizzy is the woman in charge of most con masquerades and the head of Zenkaikons cosplay department who promised me a spot back and then I didn’t get a spot
Bill: maybe she feels guilty about that fuck up.
N👌kri (Marisa): Or I’m a horrible gremlin they don’t want to associate with <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: You picked up your pronoun, THEY are horrible gremlins.
Bill: I'm not going to lie, I can't actually fathom a reason why anyone wouldn't like you to tell you.
Bill: Asides from they just don't appreciate one of the best people I know.
N👌kri (Marisa): I’m weird and gross and freaky <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I wanna be like 'oh it's a blue moon and people get weird and furry now' but like? There's no good reason anyone wouldn't like you which means they must be bad.
Bill: Since when was this trip 2 hours and 45 minutes.
N👌kri (Marisa): Come quick I’ve switched lobby chairs 3 times
Bill: Woo dodged forgetting my Jessica Jacket.
Bill: That’d be bad.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): First contact has been made with tol Flareon Yang girl
Bill: Show her your guitar. Bitches love guitars.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But... puns....
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's ok they love puns too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Puns is good start
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Then you can send the ...... ~~dick~~ pick pics <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): welp, the soldering was easy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the difficult part is using this fucking software
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have no idea what I need to download and none of the resources I'm finding are any help
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm doing everything it tells me and keep getting errors
