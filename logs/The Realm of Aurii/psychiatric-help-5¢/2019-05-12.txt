Bill: Not even an oof...  Iâ€™m not posting in the vent-support channel because Iâ€™m feeling great. Not that anyone is obligated to but. Itâ€™s bothering me. Course that just makes me petty and/or needy, so even complaining is stupid.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whats bothering you?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought your oof was a continuation of the previous thought
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like the song was still stuck in your head
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Because you gave no context
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If you want to get a response from friends, you need to give context, or people are gonna assume, we arenâ€™t mind readers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea i mean having a song stuck in your head isn't really enough context and there isnt much too say.

And i also thought the oof was a continuation of that because theres no context.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ðŸ‘†
