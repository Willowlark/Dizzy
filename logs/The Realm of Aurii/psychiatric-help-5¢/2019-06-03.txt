Bill: *Wonderful* the shirts I bought at Rowan are the nail in the coffin, apparently I’m either dealing with too broad shoulders in shirts or not long enough for gut. Hard between sizes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Went to bed early yesterday and I'm still tired as shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I went to say goodbye to my mom and ended up saying goodnight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's gonna be one of *those* days
Bill: Yeah that. I’m hoping to get a little more rest on the train.
Bill: My eyes just hurt tho.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yo me too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm beat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Scott made a new IG account for their CR group lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): Y tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: I woke up to a comedian doing a bit on being polite to hide that you hate yourself.
Bill: But it’s a cat. That’s telling you that.
Bill: Jen mentioned Saturday she’s got a friend from roller derby she thinks I might like and asked if I’d wanna be set up... which is good, I certainly don’t get anywhere on my own...

Ideas grown on me a bit too, thinking about it on and off since... but like, Jens going to show her my picture I’m sure (as she showed me hers) and I’m just. Apprehensive of yet another hope spot being crushed. Not that there’d be anything wrong with her not wanting to go along with Jens idea, all on me and how whenever I try something it just doesn’t work and I get sad.
Bill: Like, I just wanna say “I’ll just have faith/hope and see what happens” cause that’s all that’s really needed, but I keep doing that and never get the good thing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Even if you guys just go on one date to see if you enjoy hanging out with each other is a good start. Hope she says yes!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Roller skating would be a cute date. That's how my parents met
Bill: Just getting to the one date is the part I can’t believe anymore lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take my dude
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It sucks to think that there’s a possibility at rejection but you get numb to it after a while
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m on my 30th-something intern application and I’ve been denied or waitlisted from all of mine
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The first rejection I cried for a long time but now I’m just like _fuck it I’ll apply to more_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just realized gen and Chris confirmed doing that critical role group
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But also committed to our avengers group
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!334090409389195266> we may want to confirm which day to cosplay it least we lose two people
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sunday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _to the dark side_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sunday?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): katsu needs more days
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh wait I’m doing Scott pilgrim Sunday oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly wouldn't be surprised if Chris and Gen drop from our group
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEaaaaaaa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): To join _scotts new family_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like Sunday is such a bad day for big group cosplays 😦
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it is
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but so far everyone in there has voted sunday or friday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wait are they doing crit role on Sunday or are we eyeing Sunday
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mostly sunday
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which when Anna said "sun... day..?" I was like *excuse me?*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _whoa really I wanted Saturday oops_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think everyone had plans for  "bigger" cosplays or something for saturday
Bill: Avengers is the big plan for most of you, make it Saturday. At least Friday. Sunday is a waste.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m putting in much time on thor I wanna be sexy on the big day
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if im 100% honest
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): us 3 should make the call
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): agreed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and just do it when we want
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause we committed
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And some people may vote and then drop out anyways
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because i kinda dont really care about the rest of the group and trying to wrangle cats
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if they do it, then they do it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but anna taking "charge" has made me kinda stop caring about it lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, I didn't put any work into my costume for this, so there's not much to show off, but y'all worked/are going to work really hard on your shit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If you set a date I think most people will fall in line
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): probably
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah Anna taking charge has really pissed me off for this group
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Erik you did _good internet research_ that deserves credit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I enjoy her enthusiasm but I feel like I’m chasing a wheel rolling downhill
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just used the same site as one of my cosplay idols and then took my own measurements <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You would be shocked how many people don’t do the second part
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao yea and then complain publicly about how their costume doesnt fit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 🍵
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anyways so setting a date
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How to choose between Friday and Saturday?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): id rather do friday or part of saturday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I split my Katsu day’s in half most times anyways
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like Saturday is _the day_
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it is yea
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean I’m probably not gonna work on anything much crazier than thor
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the only think "intense" im gonna work on is ozmas armor (hopefully)
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i'll prob wear that friday though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or for only a small time cause armor fucking sucks to wear
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Friday is the unofficial shoot day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is always better than the official one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you right
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it sure is
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe I’ll do lux on the other half of Saturday... eventually.........
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m feelin Avengers Saturday morn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or Friday morn
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'm good with either so i guess lets get eriks input and then i'll just announce it in the avengers group
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Morn is better photos because people are still waking up or getting badges
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea, im with you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would be fine either of those
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Kewlio we all agree <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): there are other photographers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fhdsajkfhklas
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hunter prob doesnt even care anymore now that snow yeeted
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >.>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought hunter was being gamora?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he says that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WILL HE THOUGH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): was honestly surprised it was Hunter who reacted first when I said Widow was delivered
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:ishetho:573830887485997097>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): god ok, i need to vent for a second because im like 5 seconds from exploding and walking out of this job.

I was out for like MOST of last week because i was sick as fuck between tonsilitis and migraine attacks.

BUT, i still made an effort to drive all the way into work a couple days to make sure the orders were placed and in and to make sure everything was running smoothly and getting done. 

I purposely came in to make everyones life easier. DIDNT get any apprciation for that, instead i just got condescending remarks from my boss about like  boss-"so no pet orders this week?" 
me- "no i came in and did them on monday before i left to go to the doctor, everything is in and ready to go"
boss- "i see."

and also 
boss-"theres a special order that needs to be in this week and you didnt do it im unhappy"
me- "no, i placed all special orders on monday when i came in to do the rest of the orders, everything is in."
boss- "why isn't there expedited shipping?"
me- "because it would cost twice as much as the product we ordered and we would be losing a lot of money"
boss- "i don't like that response, you need to fix this."
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and now today i come in and she comes into my office like "so you have no more sick days or vacation days until january, and also youre spending too much time in your office and not enough on the sales floor" WHILE HANDING ME ANOTHER PILE OF PAPERS
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THAT ALL NEED TO BE DONE ON THE COMPUTER.....**IN MY OFFICE**
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and apparently while i was out sick she was talking shit about me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): to my coworker
Bill: What the fuck.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like are we fucking 12 years old?????????????
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): are we fucking kidding?????????????
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what the fuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): what the fuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): how old is your boss?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes like late 50's
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and an absolute psycho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I. Need. A. New. Job.
Bill: Maybe your boss and Jess’s boss can get together and have heart attacks.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): She nutssss whatt
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): god, please
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ugh i came in today with like a good outlook on life
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and now im just done
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i want to go home
Aldus Larian (Jess): is there someone above her you could talk to or would that not work?
Bill: I think she’s the store owner right?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nope because everyone is like sucking her dick
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no the owners are the ones sucking her dick
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: Nani
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have a meeting scheduled by pyscho boss lady to talk with their business coach man on friday
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I did the work
I don't like that answer
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wut
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and she can bet her fucking ass im gonna go the fuck off
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats bullshit. you made tome to come to work while you felt like shit to make sure it wouldnt interfere with anyone else and you get that shit. fuck her
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like literally no one was appreciative at all
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i shouldve just not come in and let the place crash and burn
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): monday was when i was feeling my absolute worst too, like i was living in  a hazed state and everything hurt and i could hardly focus, and yet i still came in to make other peoples lives easier
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fuck thattttttttttttttttttt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): letting the place crash and burn would probably make your life harder on yourself... 
~~wait until you quit to do that~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you right
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~but god it would be so satisfying~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^^^^^^^^^^^
Bill: Set the world on fire.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i wish
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the annoying girl talks a lot about what she's gonna do when she quits and I'm just like, *as long as you don't make my job more difficult...*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Anna: *i desperately need to find us a falcon*
Me: *please don't*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg my exact thought
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMaO
Aldus Larian (Jess): *what?*
Aldus Larian (Jess): a falcon?
Bill: For the marvel group
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The superhero, not the bird of prey lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _im still mad about scott_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sayin he finds meg and her group immature and not trustworthy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Then boom “new family”
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 🐸🍵
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he seems pretty fake
Bill: Extremely fake.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and deperate
Bill: He was rude to Marisa when it was the three of us.
Bill: Boom.
Bill: bad person.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): didn't he try hanging out with the TX crew like, once? wonder if they felt the same way and never invited him back
N👌kri (Marisa): didn't georgia set that up? she asked the people in texas to hang out with him so he could make friends
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They hung out with him at Katsu cause I was there probably...
Bill: yeah, she went off with him so he'd have an reason to be with the Texas group.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause sam is the Marisa of that Texas group (as in everyone wants to love and protect him) and me and Sam are chill
N👌kri (Marisa): can we get a real falcon for the group. it can be a girl to keep with the gander bending but i think a real bird falcon would be neat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no but I thought he hung out with them in Texas once
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He hung out with them once after Katsu too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I haven’t seen that again tho
Bill: Ya'll don't like these people but pay attention to their every move. 😹
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he and Sam are both regular contributors to that mega FB messenger group
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This is tru
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I like Sam, he cool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mel is cool too but not quite as chill
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whos sam?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think i know but i wanna make sure xD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Meg’s ex, Jaune cosplayer
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh ok yes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sparrowstorm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeee
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sparrow ye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mel is accentkisses?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeeee
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): names are hard
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This is tru
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mel doesnt like me for some reason xD not sure if i did something im not aware of but whatever 🤷
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Really?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe she’s “we cosplay the same thing so I’m jealous” type
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaaaaaa it might be that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because the only time she ever was nice to me was when i wore penny at katsu, but then she recognized me in the iddle of her compliment and got quiet halfway through and i was like ":c thanks"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HUH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it makes me sad tbh xD cause i think she pretty cool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah I thought she didn’t like me for a while but I talked to her at Katsu and she’s like no I love that you’re so drama free
Bill: All the southern rwbies are weird so.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): good point bill
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think that might just be her standoffish vibe too
Bill: And buried in *layers* of drama.
Bill: Not worth the effort.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): tru
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): False, thetrashcave are great and I would die for them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): feels bad man though when people just dont like me xD
Bill: Though if I had the chance to buy Casey and Jake a drink, like, not at a con and casual like, I would.
Bill: Ye Sowwy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh well! i got you guys
Bill: ~~if you don't like my squad I don't like you <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>~~
Bill: That does extend beyond Marisa, even if Marisa is the one who needs to be reminded of it all the time.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think I ever talked to accentkisses because she always seemed intimidating
N👌kri (Marisa): i can gouge eyes out it's ok, focus on y'all
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think she finally followed me at some point?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but for the longest time I'd see her like some of my posts but wasn't following me
Bill: Oh I know you can murder faces Mawisa, I just *want* to protecc.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She liked my stuff for so long and then finally followed me!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so like, maybe following the rwby tag and they'd pop up?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dude accent follows me and likes a ll of my posts but then in person shes really rude to me and like avoids talking to me and it makes me feel so sad sgsdhjfasdk xD why ya gotta be like that ii just wanna compliment you and b friendly
Aldus Larian (Jess): what the heckie
Bill: ~~Maybe all the southern rwbies assume that everyone has an angle or is manipulating you somehow until proven otherwise~~
Bill: Sad but totally believable.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N👌kri (Marisa): o she has a lewd patreon wow
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my angle is i want to be friends with everyone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean she did get totally used by angryjigglypoop
Bill: That's because you're pure and good Lee.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this was before that whole fiasco though
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh before her post jigglypoop drama
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mhm
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so i REALLY dont understand
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): unless it really is the petty "don't cosplay the same thing as me" thing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which is like <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus Larian (Jess): my angle is like live and let live and if i get friends in the process than whoopee
Bill: You're in that camp of people I can't imagine anyone hating Jess.
Bill: You and Tom are so pure everyone loves you.
N👌kri (Marisa): did you guys miss your dnd game this weekend because of me 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah fam we did that last weekend
N👌kri (Marisa): ok wew
N👌kri (Marisa): a couple people couldn't go yesterday because of a dnd game and it got me scared you missed yours
Aldus Larian (Jess): you good fam
N👌kri (Marisa): thanks for hanging out with teresa also. the people she knew didn't come because dnd and i felt bad because she didn't have anyone to hang out with and i kept wandering, and bojo asked me to introduce her to you all and i tried and it made everything really awkward for a moment but i appreciate y'all accepting her at the table
Bill: If they love Marisa they are good. 👌
N👌kri (Marisa): she like anime
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye she drew pictures with us!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): shes really nice, i like her a lot
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea she seemed really nice!
N👌kri (Marisa): she wants to work in a museum but her grandmother is really sick and needs someone to stay home to watch her so she can't work in a museum but i think she'd do really well at a museum
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah!
N👌kri (Marisa): leanna got the highest score on the quiz 🎉 your prize will be delivered once we come up with a prize
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 😮
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is the runner up prize Marisa’s love
Kaio Vermino (Lee): the prize is your friendship and i cherish it dearly
N👌kri (Marisa): better
runner up prize can be golf pencils
first prize will be absolutely astounding
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _whoa golf pencils_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh, so apparently uniqso and ttdeye did something racist and people are boycotting? 🤔
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~those are the only places I've successfully gotten contacts~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): what did they do
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I saw that
Kaio Vermino (Lee): uniqso did??
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They tagged a POC cosplayer with the n word
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like in the tags of the post
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ..............................................................................................................................WHat
N👌kri (Marisa): WHAT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WHAT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Then apologized saying those tags were computer generated and replaced them with “pro black” tags
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is also said cause uniqso has such more diversity in yellows than Honeycolor
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _so the contacts in my eyes now are from there cries_
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ive only ever gotten uniqso contacts.... fuuuck
N👌kri (Marisa): what a stupid apology omg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And ttdeye did something last year I know, where they told POC influencers not to advertise certain contact colors because it “doesn’t go well with their tones”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oooh I vaguely remember that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t know if anything new has happened tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably just a culture barrier because all of those companies are based in Asia and might not be as conscious to things that are offensive to other cultures. Doesn't justify it, but like, just seems really out of place for a company to consciously add tags like that to deliberately be offensive
Bill: I'd have believed the computer error thing (machines are stupid and it's a believable error for a system like that, quality is based on the data not the users) if there wasn't prior cases against them
N👌kri (Marisa): ye that's what i was thinking, the tag thing could probably be a result of that, but other companies don't do that so they really must not care a lot about marketing if they make slip-ups like that
Bill: All that needs to happen is some racist accounts get scanned into the dataset, and suddenly the computer thinks the n-word is a good word for any post involving POC.
N👌kri (Marisa): does anyone know if it ended in "a" or if it was the full word that ended in "r"
because neither are acceptible for a business account but if it's the "a" version of the word, maaaaybe some black influencers would tag themselves with that tag? it's used in certain circles among poc. but the "r" version is absolutely unacceptible and straight up racism
N👌kri (Marisa): so the computer error thing has a little more validity if it's the 'a' version but absolutely no excuse if it's the full word
Aldus Larian (Jess): good point
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was an a
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which i get some POC “reclaim” the word by using it so at least there’s sort of that explanation
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): boy, I really haven't done a whole lot today and it's almost lunchtime... today's going faster than I thought
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but also it's going fast and I haven't done anything that I needed to do yet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N👌kri (Marisa): lunch break <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ooh yee Teresa was nice
El🆓de Faun (Tom): She enjoyed Kurtis and I throwing graduation caps at each other like shurikens
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And Naruto running around
N👌kri (Marisa): she likes naruto! she wore her naruto shirt because she knows i've seen an anime or two
she also made a virtual godzilla museum <:woah:543194447345876998>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): One or two <:lenny:395307171539189760>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): A few
Aldus Larian (Jess): a couple
El🆓de Faun (Tom): GODDJIRAAA
Bill: Some guy didn’t lock the door to the bathroom stall. And didn’t *say* anything when I checked the door. 

I *hate* today.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oof
Bill: I am so done.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I get so paranoid about that. I usually do the check for shoes method (as long as there's no one else in there to see me)
Bill: closed off 'rooms', not stalls.
Bill: Otherwise yeah that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oooooh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:f_respect:575713016297947157>
Bill: I am so so so so done.
Bill: Was already feeling pretty crappy cause Monday, lack of sleep, and just like, stress... Then Georgia goes off pointing I'm a buzzkill, which isn't *wrong* but it's not a conscious choice I'm making, I *swear*...  So now I feel like the local villain slash pain in the ass cause I ain't happy. Cap that off with ALL of the awkward of opening a door to find a dude shitting and. I quit. I dunno what I quit but I quit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~in her defense I called you a buzzkill not her~~
Bill: It was a really good catch all term for the topic at hand tbh.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): sorry you're having a shitty day. hopefully the rest of the day goes by quickly so you can go home
N👌kri (Marisa): Sorry to have kept you far from home yesterday ;~; try channeling your inner cucumber
Bill: You couldn't have kept me away.
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/9860498/android/sticker.png;compress=true
N👌kri (Marisa): But I did you were like 5 hours from home
Bill: *I was really worried about you and extremely glad to see you in person*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I agree it was really good to see you in person and hang out and have a fun party <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the food was really good
N👌kri (Marisa): Sorry I was a scared anxious wreck the whole time ;u;
N👌kri (Marisa): We collected everyone’s drawings that were on the tables :3c
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you didn't seem like it <:pew:543202259085950996>
N👌kri (Marisa): O that’s really good because inside I was entirely freaking out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mine was the slenderman no no no one. Sorry I didn't sign it
N👌kri (Marisa): A Masterpiece™
N👌kri (Marisa): When did we get an emoji of Winnie the Pooh’s soul leaving his body and flipping off into space
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): used a whole golf pencil tip
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WHAT?
N👌kri (Marisa): Wait nvm that’s not this server. Why is it in my recommended emoji
N👌kri (Marisa): It’s animated and pretty long
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I want to see it now
N👌kri (Marisa): A hole ~~in one~~ golf pencil tip <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N👌kri (Marisa): It’s a react of this gif how do we get this in Aurii
El🆓de Faun (Tom): WOAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Kurtis's Dracula was top tier
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And my knock off gaara
Aldus Larian (Jess): i submitted 2 mediocre anime bois
Kaio Vermino (Lee): jess i think you spelled  "good" wrong
Bill: It's that dyslexia right.
Aldus Larian (Jess): they were ok ™
N👌kri (Marisa): can’t spell good without at least several letters in ok™
Bill: *Marisa is an expert on being good at things*
Aldus Larian (Jess): o true
Bill: Since you agree, that also means she knows a good thing when she sees it. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N👌kri (Marisa): No u r good
Aldus Larian (Jess): her opinion is skewed cuz friend
N👌kri (Marisa): I am unreliable source of opinion <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N👌kri (Marisa): Unless I say is good then take it to a museum
