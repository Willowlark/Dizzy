Aldus Larian (Jess): that is was too small, dizzy so lorge tho.
Bill: ah.
Bill: I think today's work is going to be the work I did the second half of yesterday, since IBM doesn't know how quickly I can do that work now. (It took a week and a halfish the first time, but the upfront time means I was able to do a new version in half a day.)
Nokri (Marisa): Uguu the doctors office called and told me to move up my next appointment to the next couple of days because they want to discuss the results of the ultrasounds rip
Bill: oof. They didn't say anything over the phone so you don't like. worry for the next few days?
Nokri (Marisa): They told me some minor things that I should do until the next appointment but said it’d be best if I came in to discuss it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: That's something at least.
Bill: Saying "Hey, come in sooner. Just do it." HAS to qualify as bad bed side manner.
Nokri (Marisa): Walks into doctors office
There’s a wheel set up
“Hey welcome! You have uhhh”
Spins the wheel
“This disease! Congratulations here’s a free toothbrush!”
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Omg....
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And yeah I agree that makes you more nervous than you have to be talking like that
Nokri (Marisa): [doctors office calls]
“Hello?”
“Hey gurl! Whatcha doin? Whatcha thinkin about?”
“O-oh, hi doctor”
“Guuurl you will not BELIEVE these test results, smh. Get over here omg we can do mani pedis while we chat”
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yo that'd be SO MUCH BETTER
El🆓de Faun (Tom): PLZ
Bill: Cut my fucking thumb sharpening my knife.

Nokri (Marisa): sacrifice
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oof. Hope it's not too bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): plz dont die
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: Should be fine, it's just in a weird spot for the bandage.
Bill: Lost track of the sharpening though so I had to do a resharpen from scratch.
Bill: All I've done today is whittle at a chunk of wood and explain shit on a conference call.
Bill: ... time for lunch!
Bill: Oh we did have more butterfly closure things, I'm good.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Last day of class and my kids give me this! 😭😭😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): THATS ADORABLE 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): my coworker tells me the same drinking stories everyday 😭
Nokri (Marisa): they drink so much they forgot
Aldus Larian (Jess): he's told me how "tequila changes you" at least 10 times today
Aldus Larian (Jess): this morning on my way to work i was doing 70 in a 55 and people were still passing me and i was like <:huh:555585958146473984>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt even realise i was going taht fast
Nokri (Marisa): that's so fast 😱
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i know D: !
Nokri (Marisa): did you die?
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont drive that fast like ever but i was just going with flow of traffic ~~and hype music~~ and then i was lack AHH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): damn how you got hype music at like 8 am lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): IT FRIDAY NEED HYPE
Bill: 70 in 55 when it's route 15 is easy.
Bill: The speed limit is was too low on that road.
Nokri (Marisa): noooooooooooo
speed limits have big good reasons
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea until you hit a deer
Nokri (Marisa): Who are you <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nah I think 55 is good
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Too many turns and woods
Bill: You can see deer anywhere in north jersey tho~~
Bill: Though some of those turns are too sharp ye.
Bill: And that one hill is off.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Too fast
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m reading the evaluations my kids submitted on me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): All of them are very positive
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): One of my kids also noticed that I tried to play frisbee with them when they take breaks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I appreciate being noticed lol
Nokri (Marisa): kouhai noticed you
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wanna go to a school where Marisa and Georgia are the teachers
Aldus Larian (Jess): did u cry? i think i would have crie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I did cry with the card
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They’re such good kids
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Though 5 of them have requested to follow me on insta
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The rules say we can’t accept the requests, so I haven’t, but I personally don’t care
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t really understand the policy of why we can’t let them tbh especially cause I got the section of older kids so most of mine graduated out of the program
Nokri (Marisa): gotta maintain professionalism in front of students, and minimize undesirable interactions as much as possible
that could be them trying to hit on you, or them asking you questions outside of class. the latter is fine, but you want a physical trail of all interactions with students as much as possible in case some weird incident happens.
teachers are supposed to be role models and counselors more than friends. they can be friendly, but gotta be careful not to overstep their boundaries, which is why online friendships are not allowed in most cases. especially with younger kids because they dumb
Nokri (Marisa): by younger i mean under 20
Nokri (Marisa): we're so old
Nokri (Marisa): plus teachers are humans who need breaks from being a role model, so they should have a space online where they don't need to worry about their students seeing them or having to answer questions outside of regular working hours
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof I forgot how busy the liquor store is on Friday nights
Nokri (Marisa): all those petitioners to close it down, right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
