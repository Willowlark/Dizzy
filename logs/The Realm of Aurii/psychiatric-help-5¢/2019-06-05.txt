Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Am I a shitty person if I don't boycott those contact sellers?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ....I'm not gonna lie... I'm still probably gonna buy from uniqso
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Like what they did was not great but also no other contacts have worked for me without discomfort and visibility besides the sweety ones
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And contacts can make or break a cosplay sometimes.... unfortunately.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, obviously I don't support what they said or did. It was dumb on their part and they absolutely should get called out on it. But like, they sell a product that I use and can't really get anywhere else so........
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea I'm on the same page
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Like I'm not gonna promote them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok, glad I'm not the only one
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Or stand up for them in any way
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But I still need my contacts boi
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and here I was going to submit a review for Uniqso with photos
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so maybe, I'll just hold off on that......
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yeaaa probably a good idea lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): contacts are annoying because it's really hit or miss
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it takes trial and error to find ones that work for you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I *just* found the Sweety ones work for me
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Same dude
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i wanna try them next D:
Aldus Larian (Jess): but i was feeling a guilty about it too
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I've had to throw out other contacts before because they just dont work and that money down the drain. I cant keep "trying" different brands that hurt my eyes or dont show up
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Sweety contacts work for dark eyes
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And they dont hurt me cause they soft as fuck for my astigmatism
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Soooo...... unless they start selling to another company
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Or allowing direct purchases
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Then I'm gonna have to keep buying them from uniqso unfortunately
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea you both had good things to say about them and they look great on both of you so i was looking forward to trying thtm
El🆓de Faun (Tom): they did take disiplinary action against the staff involved
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And they did apologize too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and honestly Uniqso has good shipping
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yeah like 4 times xD
El🆓de Faun (Tom): granted its a normal company thing to do to cover thier bases
El🆓de Faun (Tom): they even have this cute bear bowing

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ah they did apologize that’s good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ll probably still buy from Honeycolor first and foremost and I won’t go out of my way to promote uniqso
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I might still buy from there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Honeycolor sells like no yellow contacts
Bill: One things that’s motivating me to start looking at moving out options isn’t I can’t come home and drink some beer and be *stressed* without worrying my parents.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Honey color wont allow me to pur hase because my I havent been to my doctor recently..... so .... <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Even though I have a prescription/ doctor contact or  whatever
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"If you are from different ethnicities, let us know and you can help us to understand the other’s cultures better."*
As I said yesterday, the company is based in Asia which, I could be wrong, *doesn't have a lot of black folk* so I can understand them not understanding things from cultures they may not be as familiar with. It's good that they want to learn from this mistake and learn about other cultures so they can do better in the future
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wait really?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Honeycolor never asked me for doctor stuff huh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah they didn't ask me for doctor stuff when I ordered
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yeah its also likely that the person invovled didnt even know it was a slur
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i wouldnt be surprised
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Maybe they changed it since I tried last then
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I know I was hesitant about ordering from them because I saw on their site something about having a prescription from your doctor or something, but when I went to actually order there wasn't anything about it
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea I really dont think they know it's a slur.... not to make an excuse for them. But with POC people online reclaiming the n word in videos and in their regular speech patterns
Kaio Vermino (Lee): An Asian company that's trying to use more poc models
Aldus Larian (Jess): THAT. that basically what i was typing
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Probably is just grabbing hashtags from other poc accounts
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~ill give them the benefit of the doubt this time~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I also didn’t like that they didn’t tag a lot of models sometimes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They just started doing that tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I like that change
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ttdeye kinda fucked up like a lot worse
Kaio Vermino (Lee): In a way that's not a cultural thing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah....
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which sucks because I really like the red contacts I got from them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tho they also said “our customers are primarily in Brazil and America” near the beginning of the drama I guess to try to explain themselves
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought that was dumb
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yeaaaaa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _POC live in America yall_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But they seemed to own up to it now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WOW THE IRONY
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Uniqso is having a BOBO sale on Sweety lenses until the 14th
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): as in, buy one get one free
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what awful timing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~but if you wanna try them, now would be a good time~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): that may have been part of their recovery
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seeing as this story was from an hour ago, I wouldn't doubt it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh wait no, I got the promo email 4 days ago
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh shit XD
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): holy shit i had flights
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the flight i was looking at went from 415 to 471
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and the one i booked went from 353 to 415
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and they stopped offering the economy option even tho seats are available
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _airlines are a scam_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): what the fuck
El🆓de Faun (Tom): they changed the price AFTER you booked?
N👌kri (Marisa): !?!?!?
N👌kri (Marisa): they charged you more??
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no no i got lucky and zoomed in before hat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but its still ridiculous
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im ok but thats nuts that one thing can fluctuate like that
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yaeh thats cray
N👌kri (Marisa): oooo no yeah, they do that all the time
N👌kri (Marisa): it can jump or drop several hundred dollars in 24 hours
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): fuck physics i shouldve been a pilot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Welp, one thing Dunkin *definitely* has over Wawa is their cold brew. Decided to get cold brew coffee today at Wawa and it just tastes like coffee flavored milk. Much sad.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :(
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oop i had a fight with lily last night
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she wanted to take a nap in the family room and demanded that everyone be quiet and i said thats just not reasonable and she got all angry
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and now she needs me to drop something off for school
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Bruhhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://media.tenor.com/images/7d0afb1e127cf08d1cd7a6973112a765/tenor.gif
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah it's not reasonable
El🆓de Faun (Tom): "You couldn't live with your failure and where did that bring you?"
"Back to me"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): why did she want to nap in the family room specifically? like, why not her bed? lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she told me she just didnt want to sleep in her bed
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but she told mom that shes ocd and can only nap on couches
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/in-name-last-h4Z6RfuQycdiM
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mom pointed out how unreasonable it is to ask everyone to be quiet in a public space tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): how old is lily?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Throw out her bed and buy a couch for her room instead I guess
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she 16
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ik and kate and i both napped yesterday _in our beds_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): actually Tom, not a horrible idea. Get her a pull out so it can be a couch for naps and then a bed for regular sleep
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ugh *teenagers*...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ...scare the living shit outta me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *if she's actually OCD and that's one of her compulsions and not just she's decided that*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *then she's just being a beat*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anna emphasizing she’s a single Pringle
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Guess it wasn’t a break after all
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Big sad
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oh yea she said he was also starting to sound anti-lgbt
Kaio Vermino (Lee): and it was making her upset
Kaio Vermino (Lee): so shes like "probably for the best"
Kaio Vermino (Lee): and then followed up with
Kaio Vermino (Lee): "because fucking yikes"
Kaio Vermino (Lee): sOOOOOOOO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof

Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think that might have been when i was on another medication which might have been why?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof, after my CCE post blowing up past 1100 likes, my latest one struggling to make it to 100 is kind of depressing
Glonk: Certain pain relief meds used to trigger my asthma as a child
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA I was reading that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I get that feel erik
Bill: In talking to my pastor/counselor friend she explicitly said “(you have to know) you are worthy.” and that’s the best unintentional pop culture reference I’ve ever experienced.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): For Thor?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Was this a friendly chat or another “session”
Bill: Yes Tom. Session.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I see
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Still mulling over the licensed person option?
