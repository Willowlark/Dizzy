Bill: I wonder, if my commutes were shorter, I‚Äôd be less down. As it stands it‚Äôs a lot of time for my mind to wander in depressing directions with no distraction from that.
Tikur (Kurtis): Nah, I mean the commute probably adds to it but it also matters where your head is at so if you have a bad head space then the length is not going to help
Tikur (Kurtis): Unrelated but this 10 min stretch of road has taken me 40 going on 59 min and I wanna die
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof
Bill: Ye not a cause but wondering if it a factor.
Bill: Mood!
Bill: I went up through franklin to sr23 to 287, then didn‚Äôt take 287 and took some other backroad up to 87. That‚Äôs been an hour 40, now I‚Äôm in quote ‚Äúa severe delay‚Äù for the next 8 miles.
Tikur (Kurtis): Yeah a dump truck over turned on 80 and everything went to hell.  Even back roads were back up crazily
Bill: Yuuuup. Happy fucking Tuesday.

Aldus Larian (Jess): they better cause otherwise

Nokri (Marisa): At least I‚Äôm not on pool duty where they have to stand in the sun all day and uncrumple money with cocaine in it 8)

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): vampire pirate Zen
Bill: I snorted in a conference call.
Nokri (Marisa): I forget his name I couldn‚Äôt keep reading after the giant chested ditzy bunny girl
Mint eye zen
Aldus Larian (Jess): bless u
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs actually really good until she shows up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): can i buy some bows marisa owo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): or commission some AFINA ARTS
Nokri (Marisa): Nah I have bows that I owe you I was bringing to Otakon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you dont owe me bows, i havent paid you yet!
Nokri (Marisa): I said I‚Äôd make you bows before I owe you a blue one from something
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~suit saeran is dat u~~
Bill: ~~yes~~
Nokri (Marisa): I had to sew something else today but I can‚Äôt remember what it is. I‚Äôll probably remember when I go to put it on at Otakon
Bill: I prepay for commission art, good idea.
Nokri (Marisa): Noooooo I kept intending to do Sona this week but didn‚Äôt get the chance to
Bill: That fine!
Nokri (Marisa): Am worst friend
Aldus Larian (Jess): you spell best wrong
Bill: I shoulda gave you mones ahead of time anyway, that's how all the other commissions worked.
Bill: what Jess said.
Nokri (Marisa): Noooo
Uhh hold something says it was delivered but that‚Äôs not my house in the picture
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh nooo! D:
Nokri (Marisa): I don‚Äôt even know where that is, all the houses near mine have paved walkways
Nokri (Marisa): I SAW the delivery guy out front too
Nokri (Marisa): What he do
Aldus Larian (Jess): he had one job
Bill: lol. I didn't get a package yesterday, I sypathize.
Nokri (Marisa): uuuu that was the SD card for my camera for otakon idk what to do now
i hope whoever gets it can bring it here? but idk ahh
Nokri (Marisa): maybe the drug store will sell cheap ones
Nokri (Marisa): Oh phew BoJo to the rescue
Nokri (Marisa): She found it on her way home
Aldus Larian (Jess): YAY!
Nokri (Marisa): she saw it a few blocks down and she knew the people who lived there so she knocked on the door
they asked if it was a bar of gold and she said no and they said she could have it
Aldus Larian (Jess): nice!
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Lmao what kinda question is that
Nokri (Marisa): golden standard of all questions
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How do you get Amazon to take a picture of your package? ü§î
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or when you are able to track it in real time?
Nokri (Marisa): it's random
they usually take a picture when it's delivered by one of their drivers, not the regular mailman
and i think it can be tracked in real time for certain drivers if they're within 9 stops of your house
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do you get stuff delivered directly from Amazon?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe because you're closer to a distribution center?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My stuff is always USPS
Nokri (Marisa): ooo really? :0
yeah my stuff is always either from usps or, more increasingly, a random person in a van. the people in the van take pictures of the things they deliver and sometimes can be tracked
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa
Bill: I have a handful of spare cards in my bag always Marisa, if you‚Äôre ever stuck without one I can lend one to you.
Nokri (Marisa): i'd have to borrow it for weeks though and i'd be scared of sending it in the mail in case it breaks or gets crushed or melts in the heat
no can do
Bill: None of that is an issue (except if it breaks before you BACK UP YOUR WORK), I don‚Äôt actually use SD on my camera. It takes XQD so I use an XQD and have SDs for back up purposes.
Bill: So it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue for me at all.
Nokri (Marisa): but you'd be out an sd card
Bill: One I haven't used in a year and a half.
Bill: No loss. I need to replace my spares with XQD but an XQD card costs like 150 bucks.
Bill: *I wouldn't have offered if it'd have been an issue for me it fine Marisa*
Bill: Fuck. I should have checked for sales on XQD cards on prime day.
Bill: These things are SO expensive.
Bill: but they *fast*.
Bill: Geeky fact, it's because they actually use the same interface as your graphics and other internal PC cards.
Bill: I can't seem to focus on a screen right now.
Bill: I've tried like half a dozen genres of music but I can't get my focus going.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hngh
Bill: Just don't respond woo!
Nokri (Marisa): OH I KNOW HIM
Nokri (Marisa): He‚Äôs just very very talkative
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nani
Nokri (Marisa): The Touhou guy
Nokri (Marisa): He messaged me the same way and then spoke to me a bunch while I was working at zenkai. He noticed I was busy and would leave then come back and talk later. Very talkative fellow
Bill: so don't respond woooo
Nokri (Marisa): Be aware he‚Äôs really good at recognizing people
Bill: *It's like stalking woo*
Nokri (Marisa): Naw he didn‚Äôt stalk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was able to cross 9 things off my to-do list and yet I still feel like I was really unproductive today... üòû
Bill: Were the 9 things work related? :3
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's what I meant, my work to-do list
Bill: Bet you‚Äôd feel more productive if they were from your personal to do list. :3
Bill: Special fuck you to Dropbox for adding a three device limit. I need to switch to using cloud ration exclusively.
Bill: I can‚Äôt get to my fic document to check an outline and brainstorm driving.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): do what I did and create a second dropbox account with an alternate email <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: That‚Äôd be a mess, one device would gave to locally sync the two different folders to spread across my 5 devices.
Bill: I have a private cloud via the NAS at home, it‚Äôs just a little slower so if I use Lightroom on two machines too quickly it‚Äôll create a sync conflict.
Bill: Lightroom catalog is the only reason I still use Dropbox.
