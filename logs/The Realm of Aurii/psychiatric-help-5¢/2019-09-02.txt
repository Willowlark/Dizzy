Bill: Every time I worry about something for the next 6 months I’m going to think imma pass out again. 😬🙃 Similar feelings.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): is it panic vertigo?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): do you get lightheaded?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i have that
Bill: Nah, I’m just talking about that feeling of worry in your chest. I’m the type to always assume the worst.
Bill: So Dads watch notified him of potential afib at dinner by Katy so now him and mom are off to the ER to get an ekg, since we know he has an irregular heartbeat. 🙃
Bill: It’s not a good weekend. He should be fine, but.
Bill: What I was worried about.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh no! Hope he's okay
Kaio Vermino (Lee): oh wow im sorry, i hope all is well
Bill: I think it’s a good thing if they can confirm it’s afib, cause then they can treat it... so glass half full. He’s been having a lot of issues recently with his blood sugars dropping too, way more than he ever did, so what a time to have moved out. 🙃
Bill: Moms going to Long Island next Saturday overnight and me and Katy are actually making it a point to stay at the house with him in case they drop.
Bill: Which was my parents idea.
Bill: Haaaaaa
Bill: He “looks good” at the hospital so that’s... good. 😅
Bill: And they found nothing wrong in the tests so they’re leaving. all good.
