Aldus Larian (Jess): Nuuuuu üò≠
Nokri (Marisa): i wrote the facebook page description and then bojo went in and changed things around and it's really funny. it kind of has that "someone will die." "of fun!" vibe going on
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaoo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): If I don't die what's even the point
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yo im gonna look like i just climbed out of the rainforest after 5 days
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats gonna be my attire for the party
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): bear gryllis vibes all the way
Nokri (Marisa): i hope you make it out with your arm intact <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Nokri (Marisa): afghgjfygvbhnj after painstakingly fighting over the invitee list for like an hour she just said "ok we have 12 people going, that's enough we can uninvite everyone else"
you guys made the cut <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Bill: Nice look.
Bill: What lol
Bill: To the cutting the list lol
Nokri (Marisa): she likes to invite people she knows won't be able to come, like people who live in california
i don't think she expected anyone to say yes either <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow I just got invited to this really awesome looking party
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can't wait to go!
Nokri (Marisa): woah really? freaky, i hope you have fun and enjoy the cool party
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I will!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): welp, I can feel I'm getting sick again. Got that itchy throat thing starting up
Nokri (Marisa): might've been someone on the plane <:rip:369476083248267274>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): con funk
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :(
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh boy. 
Our internet is down and they are replacing the kitchen today is gonna be a day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof what a bad exam
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The practice one looked nothing like the real deal
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Walked in confident walked out dead
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): At least everyone seems to feel the same ho
Bill: Oof. Those professors are the fucking worst.
Bill: Any other exams?
Bill: Today?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah that was just the first
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh no
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not today
Bill: The worst is going from one bombed exam right into another.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm gonna take a nap, watch some Brooklyn 99, and then study for the Monday exam
Nokri (Marisa): If everyone did poorly then maybe they curve <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Bill: I got like a low B on a japanese exam (very easy class) because I bombed a CS final just before that.
Bill: Everything in Stem gets curved after a point.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah there‚Äôs definitely a curve, it‚Äôs just a question of how much
Nokri (Marisa): **the full bullpen** that‚Äôs a good episode it‚Äôs also got the Monty hall problem
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Some kids that I knew aren‚Äôt very smart handed in the three hour test 30 mins in so hey I did better than those kids
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I have 100% on my homework‚Äôs
Bill: And that can make a hell of a difference.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yup and I come to class and ask questions
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs amazing how many smart kids that do well on exams don‚Äôt give a shit and just don‚Äôt do the homework
Bill: They suffer for it.
Bill: ~~I certainly did~~
Bill: It's a habit you have to break as professors start putting more weight on homeworks.
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs entirely dependent on the professor. I‚Äôve had some that wouldn‚Äôt ever check, but if you didn‚Äôt do the homework you‚Äôd certainly fail the exam. 
Or some professors check every little detail and homework *is* the class, no tests or anything. 
Or sometimes they just assign homework because it‚Äôs a rule from their boss and they really don‚Äôt want to
Bill: Yup.
Bill: You gotta be well rounded by the end.
Bill: I was always pretty good with test taking so I used to be able to coast on that.
Bill: Then shit got hard and the homeworks were the only chance I had in some classes. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I want coffee but i dont want to disturb the guys working in the kitchen

Aldus Larian (Jess): I coouuullldddd but then ill have to like awkwardly make 6 cups of coffee for like 5 dudes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *but it would mean less time spent at your desk*
Aldus Larian (Jess): truueeee but awkwardness
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oof, sorry to hear about that exam üò¢
Nokri (Marisa): Maintain eye contact while brewing coffee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:then_perish:554720548274569246> <:thenflourish:564838295108976680>
Bill: Oh. Snow might. Be using Hunter. If he likes her... she won‚Äôt be considerate of his kindness. She‚Äôll use it.
