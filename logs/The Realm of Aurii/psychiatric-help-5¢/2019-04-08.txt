Bill: ~~I wonder if Brittanie realizes wezrez on Twitter is some Arabic guy~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Prob not
Bill: ~~meanwhile this guy being helpful even though my twitter posts are copypasta of Instagram~~
Bill: The Pyrrha tweet got 30 likes and I usually get none tho.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NICE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I should make a Twitter if at least to hold the username
Bill: You already lost your name so.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <@!245270932602486784>cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Fuck
Bill: I gotta try and use Twitter more.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “<@!245270932602486784>cosplay”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You know what I mean omg
Bill: 😏
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ```@wezrezcozplay```
Bill: Yeah. I’m still going to tag you wrong cause it’s an automated copy of Instagram posts.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Damn how can I steal that guys twitter
Bill: Could message him for the username but? Thats an awkward conversation.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Speaking o twitter...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~im tryna be over the disliking meg thing but damn is it hard~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I meaaaannnn.... I also feel that way about ochako xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): However she uses" I could care less" and it should be " couldnt" so...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But yeah, disliking Uraraka isn't an uncommon thing so if you think she's making a dig at you, I think you might be overthinking it... :/
Bill: ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But yeah, the real crime is her grammar
Bill: You cosplay todo more.
Bill: I mean. Ochako is a crappy character, but that’s cause the author is terrible at writing women.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ye
Bill: Plus you know. Kakacho is adorable and gets good fan art so she probably got salty about kiribaku.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't understand why people feel it necessary to say things like that ngl
Bill: 
Bill: Look at this. Spicy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~not gonna say anything negative but ... genuinely curious why this is a ship? Has something happened in canon that makes it popular?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): They versed each other in the tournament I guess?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I guess that makes sense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah the tournament. He respects her as an equal
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~and then there was a part in the movie that was total Kachacco fanservice~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Is the movie part of canon?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It feels completely disconnected
Aldus Larian (Jess): It canon as far as I know
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's disconnected from the main storyline of the anime, but it's still canon
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's a standalone
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Gotcha
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and they did it in a way that you could watch it, knowing nothing of the series, and be relatively caught up and know what's going on
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they did a good job
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea it kind of felt like an introduction to the series in a way
N🆗ri (Marisa): movie takes place over their summer break, there's a manga that connects it to the main series. good way for parents taking their kids to the theater to understand what's happening.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oooo ok the manga connects it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Shouldve known
N🆗ri (Marisa): not even the main manga, it's a small manga they gave out at the theater in japan like a one-off booklet. freak.y
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh. That's weird, or is that like a normal thing?
Bill: The consistent spark people use in fanfic is the fact that bakugo is the only one who respects Uraraka as a hero candidate.
Bill: Because he seriously fought her in the tournament, didn’t pull punches because she was a girl.
N🆗ri (Marisa): for some anime they do that i think. it's not common but it's not uncommon
more common for them to give out snippets of the animation reel
Bill: Fanfic builds around that as their relationship. Bakugo sees something more in her, and with a push from him (usually trying to better himself through working with her) she finds confidence like he has and beats back his bakugoness to establish her place in the relationship.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Mmmm ok
Bill: TLDR she starts giving it back as much as he dished out.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Cant say I like that dynamic myself, but it explains why people ship it
Bill: Which I like cause uraraka a spineless blob in canon outside that fight.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So thank : o
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea I like that it gives her some oomph
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But it's such a reach that I'm just... meh about it
Bill: Like, deku and ochako feeds that too. Deku is her big strong man and she can take a back seat as his fawning supporter.
N🆗ri (Marisa): in this thesis biru will present forth both support and arguments for bakucho, as well as outline its presence in the american fanfiction community and its impact on the fandom on a global scale. according to all known laws of aviation there i
Bill: I like the independence she finds in those fics. She as a character grows, it just so happens to be because of the new person she spends time around.
Bill: Anyway.
Bill: There is NO canon backing for it and it’ll never happen. But sometimes the fanfic is better than canon.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yee you right, I dont really read fanfics myself but it definitely helps explain the backing for all the art of it and stuff
Bill: Yeah. There’s a short sad one too. It’ll wreck you. iirc that was the first one I read.
Bill: That got me into the slow burn one which was *really* well done.
Bill: That one and inch for Weiss. I don’t usually read sad but they were so well done.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): oo good art
Elfriede Faun (Tom): also people just like the whole opposites thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good point
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I like them but its more i would like to see how that ship goes if it were to be entertained
N🆗ri (Marisa): didn't uraraka bite bakugo also
N🆗ri (Marisa): in a special or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): that might've been fanmade
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oo yeah that was fanmade
Elfriede Faun (Tom): https://youtu.be/bbTGU-fsezg
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Amazing
N🆗ri (Marisa): amazing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): https://youtu.be/1PKejUcwYGk
