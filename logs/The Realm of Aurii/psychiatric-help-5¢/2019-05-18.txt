Bill: Today on ‚Äúgirls who look too young‚Äù, cute girl in bagel shop, also said ‚ÄúScience Journal‚Äù in conversation with her friend.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ‚ÄúScience journal‚Äù?
Bill: I dunno. Sounds like something you‚Äôd have to do in high school science class.
Nokri (Marisa): sounds like college level or above. journals are compilations of published papers within a field of research that people rely on for more academic papers. my masters classes required us to read ~5 journal articles per class per week. we only had to use them in high school for big projects and back then we didn't really know what they were since we just used a generic database to search for stuff pertaining to our topics. the whole "independent journal" aspect mostly came around in college.

she could've been talking about research or something she wanted to publish
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah that‚Äôs probably an undergrad or grad student
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Most college peeps wanna get published in journals lol
Bill: Maybe, still immense confusion.
