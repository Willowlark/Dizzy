Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so the physics advisor emailed me back
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he had a "make your own choice, but i would advise against taking the internship" kinda email
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): very comprehensive though and he addressed all the concerns i had
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i respect his opinion
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i think ill email the previous physics advisor to see what he thinks
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Hmm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ethan's GB Zero Two is a big yikes
Nokri (Marisa): just noticed he's not following me anymore so i'm gonna stop following him
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good
Nokri (Marisa): he's only following 56 people and a lot of bne follows him, i wonder who else he unfollowed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think he followed too many people to begin with
Nokri (Marisa): didn't he delete his account or something a while back? i figured maybe he purged all the people he was following, unless he was just that big of a neener and didn't follow people
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He deleted his business account
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hope she was genuinely disgusted
Nokri (Marisa): that's the cringiest image i've seen in a very long time
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao
Nokri (Marisa): oh it's just a tiny little mason jar. that's even weirder, that's just an effortless attempt to ride on your coattails
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Weird flex but okay
