Nokri (Marisa): Iâ€™ve got this weird fear that Iâ€™m horrible at cooking, and that BoJo and I just think it tastes fantastic because weâ€™re so ravenous that anything tastes good. So like one day Iâ€™ll make food for others and theyâ€™ll think it tastes awful and get sick ðŸ˜±
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I doubt that xD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BRUH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Nokri (Marisa): LETS START A FIGHT LETS GO
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I canâ€™t believe heâ€™s on about that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like bruh it WAS a year ago
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and he was unhealthy as hell_
Nokri (Marisa): If he remembers the exact day heâ€™s probably not as happy about it as he claims to be
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I guess it was the 3rd or something like that
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea... it's like he has an alarm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah maybe heâ€™s just salty he hasnâ€™t been able to hold down a girlfriend since
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oooooooooooooooof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow damn thatâ€™s just pathetic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I canâ€™t believe he tweeted that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like a 13 year old girl
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah that just screams immature
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Welp Iâ€™m gonna go to sleep
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I can go back to my successful life
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Interning for NASA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): While he ainâ€™t even full time at Starbucks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _lmaooooo Hal_
Kaio Vermino (Lee): SLEEP WELL! dream of all the fantastic things you're doing without him
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Okay Iâ€™m awake again and still thinking about what a petty move that is
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea seriously...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like just keep walkin man
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You didn't even do anything though? So like, how were you the unhealthy one in the relationship lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And like nobody liked his tweet so
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Looks like public opinion differs
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Rippppppppp
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Baby time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): one of the biggest struggles about working in manufacturing is that you have to assume no one has any common sense and you need to make explicit instructions to people
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): YEP
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): <:rise:582318089228648456>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So one of the die sets for one of our pneumatic crimping tools has been giving really bad crimps lately so we switched to the hand tool for the time being and the group lead comes over complaining that the tool sucks (which is valid, usually they do) because it was doing something weird to the terminal as you crimped down. I looked at it and was like, "Well, that's because you're putting them in the wrong side... the smaller part of the die crimps the conductor area and the big part does the insulation crimp"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"wElL tHeRe WaS nO wAy I wAs SuPpOsEd To KnOw ThAt!"*
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): ....
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Were.... They trained ?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah. He's been here about as long as I have. And he's the group leader.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:wot:604744067883991082>
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oh no
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): on an unrelated note, I learned a way to make assembly procedures faster by using Mail Merge in Word. I have a batch of 17 assemblies that are all relatively similar in structure (one cable, stripped on both ends, and terminated) so I'm just setting up an excel file with all the relevant info that's a pain to retype out on each AP and then set up fields in an AP template to pull the info from the Excel sheet and then I can just click a button to change entries and save each one as a different file. Will still have to tweak each one a little to finish them, but for getting started, damn, this'll be a breeze
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i use those
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My boss started doing it for filling out corrective action forms because we fill everything in our CAR log an Excel sheet anyway and would have to transfer to the actual form so he started doing the Mail Merge to save time and it was annoying to get used to at first but now I'm realizing its potential
Nokri (Marisa): *mother, please get your boss to pay for her dry cleaning in advance. I donâ€™t have another $60.*
Nokri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Did you get reimbursed for the 160 dollars one already?
Nokri (Marisa): Not yet lol
Nokri (Marisa): It was 180 ðŸ˜Ž 
How much laundry does she HAVE
Bill: Bojo should be more assertive with this person.
Nokri (Marisa): Sheâ€™s worked as their maid for around 5 years, theyâ€™re good people and they give us leftovers sometime. Sheâ€™s just kind of spacey and doesnâ€™t pay attention to when stuff has to get done. BoJo just puts it on her tab to be added to her paycheck
Bill: Yes but that leaves you broke till that paycheck. =/
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I need to complain about migraines for a second because I had yet another waste of a day due to one..bchdjdjjdjdhdh
WHY
Kaio Vermino (Lee): My anxiety spiked because I couldnt get anything done today and I had a meltdown so THATS  fun. <:exhausted:577177500153544724> <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I need cce
Bill: NEED CCE
Bill: WE GO NOW
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Let's all go early
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I need a kalahari cup drink and a hot tub
Aldus Larian (Jess): ðŸ˜­
Bill: Looks like Kiku (Marks dog) died. ðŸ˜­
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! ðŸ˜­
