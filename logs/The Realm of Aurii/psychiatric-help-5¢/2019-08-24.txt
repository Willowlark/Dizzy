Nokri (Marisa): Man why do funerals have to be so expensive
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk man. It's kind revolting. Did someone pass away?
Nokri (Marisa): O nah I was thinking about things
Bill: Those things donâ€™t involve you do they.
Nokri (Marisa): I was trying to come up with ways to get more money but my death would only cause further debt <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Increase the price on your dice bags.
Bill: Death is not on the table.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Your death would cause a debt in our hearts too ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): Raising the price will cause them to sell less
Nokri (Marisa): Death is too expensive <:pew:543202259085950996> even if I wanted to donate my body to science to save on casket costs, BoJo would want some kind of funeral and we donâ€™t have money for that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mawisa nuuuuu ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): ye even cremation is pricey, what has society come to nowadays
Aldus Larian (Jess): You can't die it's illegal
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i can't die because the upfront costs are too expensive eyyyy~~
Bill: ðŸ˜‘
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Make money selling more bows!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wore the one you gave me to the bar last night and my grandma loved it!

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SO PRETTY
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo that looks nice!
Nokri (Marisa): oooh i'm so glad it hasn't fallen apart <:pwease:555585508819075112> if anything ever happens to it lemme know i replace it for u asap
i use the highest strength glue i can and test them each by gently tugging on the bow but i'm always paranoid they'll fall off the clips
