Nokri (Marisa): Ooo the bank messed up and gave her the wrong card (itâ€™s for my account and not hers). Reportedly this is the second time itâ€™s happened even though she told them the exact account number she wanted the card for.
Bill: I hope you all know that I care deeply for you, love and consider you as important as family. Even if Iâ€™m more distant and temperamental these days, and having trouble communicating; it still holds true. Iâ€™m trying to do my best by you, I promise that much.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Miss boss got fed up with his sons in a meeting and just left it was hilarious
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like he left the building
Nokri (Marisa): **the boss has left the building**
That means itâ€™s a free for all and whoever is the last one standing gets to be New Boss
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Of he doesn't come back in 15 minutes your legally allowed to leave and not get marked absent
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah!
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wish
Nokri (Marisa): I told her about the card and she forgot and now Iâ€™m at $-184 haha
~~Iâ€™ll have money for CCE donâ€™t worry Iâ€™ll get it~~
Nokri (Marisa): *td bank is gonna murder me*
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): Who spends that much money on dry cleaning every week
Itâ€™s for her work, she takes her bossâ€™s familyâ€™s clothes that canâ€™t be washed to the dry cleaners and then her boss pays her back but Iâ€™m always astounded how high their dry cleaning bill is
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Bruhhhhh
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no are you gonna get overdraft fees now?
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah Iâ€™ve already gotten fined $15 yesterday for having the account go under a certain amount <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): BoJo is gonna try and appeal it since they messed up the card in the first place
Nokri (Marisa): But I doubt itâ€™ll get waived
Aldus Larian (Jess): ðŸ˜­
