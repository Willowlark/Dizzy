Aldus Larian (Jess): I promised a friend id do some freelance design work for her like 2 weeks ago and inhant even started 😭
Bill: Oof.
Aldus Larian (Jess): everytime i have energy to work on something im like "eyy what is i dont use it for that"
Nokri (Marisa): those better be fireworks and not gunshots
i don't like either because loud noises aaaa but if it has to be one of the two i'd prefer the former
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Early 4th of July!
Nokri (Marisa): the best 4th of july celebration i've experienced was in japan
we tried to make hamburgers but stores in japan don't sell hamburger and hotdog buns so we had to get a baguette
and we tried to make 12 burgers (one for everyone) but wound up with closer to 60 burgers
Nokri (Marisa): this was 2016 not last year
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats amazing
Nokri (Marisa): we left the ingredients planning to one kid who claimed to be a pro at getting food
he had to call ahead to a store and ask for extra ground beef because he wanted so much
he's got a huge family that always overcooks and it came out after the fact that he vastly overestimated how much we needed <:lenny:395307171539189760>
we should've known tho when he said it'd cost 1200yen/$12 per person for ingredients though oops. we were suspicious but also we just wanted burgers.
Aldus Larian (Jess): HOLY SHIT lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ooooh my god so much laundry
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s probably cause I used the sanitize option on all my sheets and that cycle takes two hours to wash <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NOT JUst for lenny purposes tho, college is also full of disease and you can sweat in your sleep
Bill: *You were the one to bring up Lenny purposes*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I know
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I clarified that it’s also for the non-Lenny
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): An addendum
Bill: ~~I don’t think anyone would assume it’s cause of your Marisa unapproved activities if you said you have lots of laundry~~
Bill: I cut up my knee pretty bad when I feel during laser tag and I’m trying to redress it....
Bill: I can’t find any freaking hydrogen peroxide in our house.
Bill: I’ve lived here most of my life damn.
Bill: Maaaan I don’t even know if we have a first aid kit here.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damn, have you never been injured at your house
Bill: I love a mostly cedentary lifestyle.
Bill: Or you being sarcastic lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wheezes I hate spray paint
Elfriede Faun (Tom): i am not being sarcastic
Nokri (Marisa): OOPS Paula kept messaging me just saying my name all day and I ignored it because I thought it was the Touhou group again gkdnfhsishs
That’s funny
Elfriede Faun (Tom): her life is incomplete with you
Glonk: I too put my laundry on the sanitize option
Nokri (Marisa): uguu

Bill: Lol M O O D
Nokri (Marisa): i didn't have dinner yesterday and i'm hungry but i'm also too nauseous to eat anything <:rip:369476083248267274>

Nokri (Marisa): Thank you though
Bill: For when you CAN EAT?
Nokri (Marisa): No I think I almost died haha
Nokri (Marisa): It hurts
I fainted while waiting for the tub to fill up and I was sitting in a fetal position and when I regained consciousness the water was a lot higher lol
Bill: !!!
Bill: That’s not good.
Nokri (Marisa): It’s normal <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: You are normal but.
Bill: Not a normie. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): did you hit your head?
Nokri (Marisa): I’m in between waves of suffering now it’s aight
Nokri (Marisa): No I was sitting and leaning my spinal cord against the porcelain before I fainted so I didn’t fall
Bill: *Talk to us if you need anything cause we love you.*

Suffering with how long it till MARISACON AMIRIGHT
Nokri (Marisa): I’m good thank. This is actually really mild for my usual symptoms but there’s a lot more shaking and headaches which is unusual
Bill: Okay, I trust you to tell us if you do need us. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  cuz of your period? Did you take anything?
Nokri (Marisa): Sorry I couldn’t move again
Yeah, I really try to abstain from ever using medicine but I took some children’s aspirin after I couldn’t pick myself up off the floor for a while
Nokri (Marisa): It’s going down now. It’s usually only for several hours, although usually other stuff happens so I’m nervous I didn’t undergo the whole cycle
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 😦 i know you literally just said that you are trying not to take medicine but ive heard from so many people that regular birthcontrol gets rid of so many symptoms, and you did just get insurance right?
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t think I’m able to take birth control because of a big family history of stroke and heart issues <:thinku:543194478614413318> I remember considering it years ago I think
Nokri (Marisa): Like did you know BoJo has had multiple strokes
Nokri (Marisa): She was super healthy before them which is why they didn’t cause too much long term damage
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea birth control brought be from cripling pain and super tampons to light cramps ant light tampons
Nokri (Marisa): Technology is incredible
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea so if you ever get the opportunity def ask a doctor of your comfortable enough to
Nokri (Marisa): When am I ever gonna see a doctor <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): Dying on the floor of an emergency room or bust <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Nokri (Marisa): I’ll knit a dakimakura to be my substitute when I die. It’ll have one of those build a bear hearts that repeats a message when pressed except it’ll just play megalovania
Bill: I refuse.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Can we get an F in the chat for the couch I just took to the curb
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That couch was 30 years old and saw many great Georgia parties
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But mom promised me a new sectional in the new house
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _wraparound_
