Nokri (Marisa): Someone is setting fireworks off literally in the parking lot out front I’m petrified ahhhh
Nokri (Marisa): catch me relapsing into psychosis because of loud booms hahaha
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do you have ear plugs?
Nokri (Marisa): no
Nokri (Marisa): i am not ok
Nokri (Marisa): im going
Bill: Can you find a blanket to muffle the sound?
Bill: Where are you going?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh no! Where you going?
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> you there?
Nokri (Marisa): Not fully
Bill: That's okay.
Bill: So long as you are there.
Bill: Talk as much you need to.
Bill: Are they using big fireworks?
Bill: I'm pretty sure that's still illegal in NJ.
Bill: Can we call the police?
Aldus Larian (Jess): We're here to talk if you need us. Or DM if you'd feel more comfortable
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😭
Nokri (Marisa): what is there to talk about there's ntohing to talk about nothing mattesr dont botehr dont care'
Nokri (Marisa): i dont think you understand
Nokri (Marisa): you odnt have to its myself ubt its scary and ithurts
Bill: Don't have to. Want to.
Bill: They're going to run out of fireworks soon.
Bill: Is Sylvia scared too?
Bill: Is Bojo home?
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248159.php
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ay I was just reading that
Bill: Is good read. Thank Marisa.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm really, really really sorry for last night. i know that doesn't excuse my actions. my paranoia is fading though and things aren't as scary right now so my head is a bit clearer and i can see what a massive jerk i am what i have an episode. sorry.
Bill: You have nothing to apologize for.
Bill: I was literally about to ask if the episode has passed.
Nokri (Marisa): i'd fight a child if i must
Bill: I'm glad you are okay, and I'm glad you did talk to us.
Nokri (Marisa): my head really hurts and i'm still hearing things a little and my memory is pretty hazy
Nokri (Marisa): i've got that nice paranoia but it's not at people anymore it's at... idk how to describe it. society? impending doom and all that nice stuff where civilization is gonna collapse at any moment, but i studied that in college and know my fears are well founded yet highly improbable
Bill: totally understandable tbh.
Bill: society is hella suspicious.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Glad you're doing a little better! Was worried last night :c
Nokri (Marisa): i'm usually fine with hearing fireworks but the ones last night were so close that if you looked outside you couldn't see the houses across the parking lot because of how much smoke there was, and the noise was so so loud and i was afraid the house was going to burn down. just sitting inside and hearing it gave me a panic attack that utterly tore my rational mind apart <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I'm sorry you had to go through that Marisa, that sounds terrifying.
Nokri (Marisa): no i'm sorry
Bill: It okay.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Glad you are feeling a bit better this morning.  We're always here for you. You are an extremely self aware person and I really admire that about you.
Bill: I'm really glad you did talked to us.
Bill: When you say "I'm going" I got a little scared for you so you talking to us was helpful.
Nokri (Marisa): happy america yehaw
it's freaky because i know what's happening but i can't really do anything to stop it? i can explain what's going on and likely reasons why it's happening but my body goes into fight or flight mode and i can't drive the thoughts out of my head. being trapped inside your own mind yay
Bill: I completely understand that.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm conscious enough to know "i need to take this pill, and do this, and go here and wait without touching anything sharp" but instead my body is like "cry!! sob and shake while you run around the house preparing a bug out bag in case you need to evacuate! but you don't need to evacute...? then collapse in the middle of the room while everything starts moving like snakes!! wooo!!!!"
Bill: Not on the same level, but what I think and what I feel are often not in sync.
Bill: Like you can't convince yourself to not do all the weird stuff?
Nokri (Marisa): not quite. i can convince myself, but it leads to more instability. like i was able to get myself to stop getting ready to run out the door with sylvia and a box of emergency supplies, and instead get under a weighted blanket which is supposed to reduce anxiety and also it's super heavy so i wouldn't be a danger to myself as much. but even though i use it every day i started feeling like i was being crushed to death and i was sweating too much to stay under it so i had to do something else, and i had to try and find middle ground between "panic and obsess" and "stay safe and calm down"
plus after a bit i couldn't tell if the fireworks were still going off or if it was just in my head, and time gets wacky and i compulsively do things that aren't necessary
Bill: I've heard of weighted blankets before! Do you find they work?
Nokri (Marisa): i like mine because i always needed a blanket to sleep under, even if it was a billion degrees, and even though it's heavy it's also not that hot so i can sleep under it in this hot weather without being too warm. but when i get crazy my body starts reacting to everything and feeling excessively hot or cold can be a part of that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Honestly I find it impressive you can manage to that much. I don't know much about psychosis but I'd imagine keeping yourself even that grounded is nearly impossible
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Glad you're doing somewhat better <@301927856240459777> 💕
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You're a stronger person than you realize
Bill: *She said thank instead of nou and I wanna cry*
Nokri (Marisa): i imagine what i'm feeling now is what being hungover feels like <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: LOL
Bill: Close enough!
Nokri (Marisa): i think it's because i studied a lot of insanity and psychology and whatnot? so i was familiar with all the concepts, and then when i started experiencing them i was like "ah. this is that thing."
Aldus Larian (Jess): Probably close enough. I've felt hung over after a good long cry and emotional episode so I'd imagine so
Bill: Ditto to Jess and Erik, your understanding of the things you face is amazing and the level to which you operate through them is award worthy.
Nokri (Marisa): nah because i still lose control. i'm just sitting in my own head aware of what's happening but not really able to control it very well. like watching TV without the TV
Bill: It's hypocritical for me to say it; but you don't always need to be in control.
Bill: Sometimes you can't be and that's okay.
Nokri (Marisa): i'd like to be in control though when losing control means i'm running out into the street with my cat and putting us in more danger by trying to drive a car to who knows where, when i can't even see because i'm sobbing and shaking so much and i'm minorly hallucinating that everything is moving
Nokri (Marisa): plus the paranoia <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): From what I've read most people don't know what they are experiencing isn't "real" at all? So I still think it's impressive you know enough to literally tell people "stuff about to happen"
Bill: I suppose the better phrase in this scenario is you were in control *enough*.
Nokri (Marisa): ooo yeah. i'm not sure how i can tell enough of what's real and what's not. sometimes i can't. the first time it happened i thought there were bugs next to me and i kept whacking stuff over, only to look at it properly and realize it was just string? like... hm. <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
I've kept the string there so i can use that as a warning sign somewhat? if the string is moving like a snake or a bug I know something is happening
Nokri (Marisa): i can take a picture of what i'm talking about if it makes more sense that way
Bill: It's like the top in inception. <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also if there's anything we could read or do or of you want us more about what you experience personally (which you're already doing) please don't hesitate to tell us. I want to do my best to understand
Nokri (Marisa): i don't want to bother you guys it's ok i'm sorry
Bill: *if she is requesting the information it's not a bother to her, she is interested*
Bill: Also requesting.
Aldus Larian (Jess): No appologise are needed. I like learning about this stuff on a personal level but even moreso of it affects someone I love.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I won't pressure you or anything cuz I understand that it's a hard thing to talk about, thank you for telling us as much as you did.
Nokri (Marisa): here's a dragon i was working on and had some thread on. it's pretty much always in my peripheral vision because i never go anywhere lol. when i experience a bout of psychosis the thread on the dragon will move in my peripheral vision and it looks like it's crawling or slithering around, so I know that if I see something else moving in a way it shouldn't or if I see something out of the ordinary, it's probably just in my head and not real.
like when i'm half asleep sometimes i hallucinate spiders <:pew:543202259085950996> but that's happened all my life, like i'll wake up in the middle of the night and think the ceiling is covered in spider but a minute or two later i'll see that nothing is there, so i've kind of gotten used to ignoring bugs when i wake up in the middle of the night
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~das a cute dragon~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bugs are scary 😭 ugh I can't even imagine
Nokri (Marisa): please don't worry about conventions and rooming together, i don't want to bother anyone and these things happen much much less often now that i have medicine for it. it shouldn't happen during a convention and if it does i can go hide behind a vending machine until it's over.
Bill: I worry about you more when your at home alone silly.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm never alone! sylvia is here!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm glad the medication is helping! If you need some time away from people at a con or anything like that just let us know. I know it's easy to feel a bit crowded sometimes. I'd image paranoia can run a little high at a con too
Nokri (Marisa): ye. cons are usually fine because i know what to expect and i know exactly how they work. since i've been going to them once a month or once every other month for over ten years they're actually a pretty safe spot for me to be. that familiarity combined with my anxiety to conform to society also counteracts everything else and makes me hold it together better than, say, being in a restaurant or wawa or walmart or such.
Nokri (Marisa): Paranoia at cons is mainly “no one wants me here so I’ll go somewhere else”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo I'm glad you comfortable then! We def want you there!
Nokri (Marisa): Omg I should do that Kotomi cosplay so if I break down it’d be in character lol
Nokri (Marisa): irl pic of exactly what i don't want to happen
https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1534/13/1534135985865.gif
Nokri (Marisa): *it's even more accurate than i remember* this is really funny
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ohh nooo😭
Nokri (Marisa): it won't happen!!!!! i promise!!!!! i wouldn't make you guys experience any of that uncomfort
Aldus Larian (Jess): Don't worry about us 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I've never experienced any serious psychosis but when I used to have bad panic attacks that's like half way there for me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Other than bugs in the perifrieal (I butchered that word) but that happens every day, more likely because of all.my eye floaties tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Anyways! Don't worry about it! I'm also glad you know what's up when it's happening
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I just work up sorry for reitterating everything
Nokri (Marisa): eye floaties!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But yeah I used to get bad panic attack in middle school cuz of blood sugar spikes, most of the time it would only happen while I was sleeping cuz I wasn't eating in my sleep and my body would sleep walk, but panic attack sleep walk
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It was wack
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I would run around the house opening cabinets and jumping over staircases while not being concious
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Some times I'd stay up late tho and get them while I was awake and oo boi
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Once I startef eating more consistent meals and cut my sugar way down they went away tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Mostly anyways
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I still have got a few panic attacks but at least I stopped sleep walking
Nokri (Marisa): ohnoooo that sounds horrifying. panic sleep walking 🙀 
that sounds like a cryptid story and must be so freaky
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH SO THE NEET PART
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Is I would wake up during it of someone fed me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Or I'd wake up the next morning
El🆓de Faun (Tom): With the feinting memory
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So if someone fed me I'd wake up,and only remember the last 30 seconds or so
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And it was a slow wake up
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It was the wierdest feeling
Nokri (Marisa): that's a fae thing. you're fae. or ghost possession.
Nokri (Marisa): irl urban legend
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Woahhhh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That's neet
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I remember my mom or dad sitting across from me at the table asking me if I was there yet
El🆓de Faun (Tom): My dad would ask me to do math problems
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And I'd answer them while sleep walking as long as they were easy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But he would purposely ask me non sensical questions and I wouldn't of just bug out if I was still sleep walking
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): what if you had unconsciously solved some incredibly complex math theorum in your sleep
Tikur (Kurtis): Y'all the line to get into the baseball game at Skylands with tickets is MCFREAKING massive
Tikur (Kurtis): 
Nokri (Marisa): dont get crushed to death
Tikur (Kurtis): No promises
Nokri (Marisa): if there is a sports event crowding incident, 98 deaths is the current highest
Tikur (Kurtis): Ooooooh from what?
Nokri (Marisa): this lil' event right here
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster
Tikur (Kurtis): WACK, that's insane
Nokri (Marisa): yeah 🙀 people often underestimate the power of overcrowding
