Bill: Oh man oof.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what happen spill the tea
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***biru***
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's stuck in a well we gotta save him lassie
Bill: Nah just that last ask from story. Required an actual, thought out answer. Nice, but not the answer I expect they wanted to hear so...
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg proof that biru is a furry
Bill: wow. I explained a problem to Yuxi yesterday that he's somewhat related to. Harleen just emailed him about. that problem.
Bill: The chain of command is a fucking mess here, it's ridiculous.
Aldus Larian (Jess): my skin is breaking tf out 😭
Bill: ooooof
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The most annoying part of my job is trying to dumb down assembly procedures as much as possible
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because sometimes the customer drawings can be a bit confusing to people who aren't as technically minded
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but even when I try, people don't fucking READ
Bill: You overestimate the typical end user.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd love to be able to make them more visual so you don't have to read anything
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I just don't have the time for it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): even when I'm not dicking around
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): making graphics takes a lot of time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and since I'm taking on the workload of like, three different positions....
Bill: yeeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have work i really need to do but i also know im going to get called into a meeting any min and that makes it so hard for me to focus on it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my boss wanted to meet with me today to discuss something and he hasn't even showed up today
Aldus Larian (Jess): what a mood
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just want to able to get into this one thing and work on it but i know im gonna get pulled away
Bill: yeaaaaa
Bill: I hate that mood.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That happens when I'm actually invested in something I'm working on and then our shipping guy comes in with a stack of CoC's for me to sign. Breaks my concentration and annoys the shit our of me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Especially when I'm working on something that I have like half a dozen tabs open trying to keep track of
Aldus Larian (Jess): biggest of moods
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think i might need a mental health day soon
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): .....i keep getting handed other peoples work and then when i dont have enough time to get it done my boss tells me im not doing my job??????????
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like???????????????yes??? i am? but im also doing 3 other jobs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and im not allowed to work overtime
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so like when do you expect this extra 3 peoples worth of work to get done?
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn wtf do they want from u
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): why do we all have shitty jobs 😭
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and also wont give me a raise even though ive been doing extra work since jon left
Bill: *whistles*
Aldus Larian (Jess): yes biru we know you arnt included in shit job club
Bill: Hey, I've done everything I can to help you guys.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ok but like literally
Me: has five pallets to check in and stock
Boss: calls me in 3 separate times to give me paperwork on 3 other orders that are not in my department and tells me to call 3 separate vendors and figure out why none of the UPCs on an 10 page order don't work
Aldus Larian (Jess): no one said you didnt, it doesn't revoke our right to complain
Bill: who said you can't complain?
Aldus Larian (Jess): its kind of implied
Bill: Uh, no. You guys deserve to complain.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and then when i say i don't have time to do it because i have a shitload of other crap to get done today she just goes "YEA wELL we're ALL swamped here and you just need to find the time, i can't help you"

Like ok... we literally have one guy that was hired specifically to do work like this and hes been pacing around talking to himself all day long, but since he wasn't here yesterday i can't use him to help get the fuckload of work that you just dumped on me done??? 

holy fuck, this is why i think about walking out every single day
Aldus Larian (Jess): if you're so swamped then they should at least let you guys work overtime
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yep
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but nope, its like highly against the rules here because theyre too broke to pay us OT
Aldus Larian (Jess): UGH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and if you stay OT more than 1 hour you get written up
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like this place is fucking insane
Bill: hmm. Workload management is a bitch everywhere, I can tell you that much at least. It's Indellient's biggest problem with IBM.

I dunno if you tried/can't do this, but maybe ask "what is the priority item in this list". I find that gets people to think about what they're asking, and when you do the highest priority item they decided on they're more satisfied. Obviously they could still be dicks, but it's something that's worked for me before.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nope my boss thinks EVERYTHING is high priority
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh mood
Bill: it's not a gaurantee, but it at least lets you say "well, I didn't finish Y and Z cause you said X was most important."
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): including ordering chocolate bars so she herself can buy and eat them
Aldus Larian (Jess): when i ask then i get "well its all really important"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEP
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg i just actually laughed a tthat wtf
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "it's all important and needs to get done before X time. So, you better get cracking"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): listen shes come into my office in a huff
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because we ran out of hersheys chocolate
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i was like "ok i'm ordering for the entire Pet half of the store right now, thats not as important I'll get it done after this"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and shes like "NO ITS ALL IMPORTANT, DO IT NOW"
Bill: yeee.... Depending on the person I can push a little and basically say 'well I only have one pair of hands, so which is most important worst case scenario', but you have to feel that out person by person. 😭
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like..lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTF
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my boss is a psycho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and also incredibly rude
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and loud
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and shes like gone off on customers before
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...in front of other customers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and get this
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes also HR
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she never gives out praise, only criticism
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and like... LOUD criticism
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could work OT if I wanted to. My boss has no issue with it. It's just I can't bring myself to stay here longer than I need to
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): o mood
Bill: ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): even if i was allowed i probably wouldnt
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i used to care about this job
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that is long gone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was once here working on a wire harness until 9pm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): never again
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): crash and burn for all i care
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh wow
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): big nope
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea me too
Aldus Larian (Jess): like they could fire me rn and id laugh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): MOOD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that was only because it was a very complex harness (for an airplane cockpit) and our customer was coming in the next day to inspect it and we were really behind
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can stay late but ive only done it a few times
Bill: I'm salary, I can't get overtime but if there's a deadline to be met software jobs expect you to work as late as required, do overnight support, etc. Everyone in the family works more than 8 hours a day most of the week too and I'm like... why.
Aldus Larian (Jess): when somethings been urgent
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there are times when I want to just quit and focus more time looking for a new job, but then I remember that I don't get any hits for interviews so not getting hits with no source of income is a big yikes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same erik
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like ok, i have enough savings to be fine for ....a pretty long time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Aldus Larian (Jess): same
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have money anxiety
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so being without income is like hell
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaaaa
Bill: I mean.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): even if this job literally makes me have meltdowns
Bill: That's not so much anxiety as common sense.
Bill: Income is a good thing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had a decent amount of savings until I blew it all on student loans lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nah like i refuse to take money from savings even when i need it because of anxiety
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its always like  "well is this REALLY worth taking money out? what if i need it for something worse?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think the only time we took money from saving was for toms car
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I still have a decent amount and with still living at home I could probably still be good for a bit as long as I reduce my spending on other shit I don't really need
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): if i were to stop doing cons and cosplay i'd be good for like a year... but ....i need cons and cosplay so i dont lose my sanity
Aldus Larian (Jess): like we *could* survive on toms income but that wouldnt be good
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaaa
Bill: yeaaaaa
Bill: work isn't the goal in life, work is a means towards doing what you love!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): exactly
Bill: Which is why unless I have to I don’t work off hours. Which compared to other devs makes me only at expectation but. Fuck it.
Bill: They need *lives*.
Bill: Relevant
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > sees Lissy post a photo from our Hunter shoot
> checks photato dump channel to see if Hunter posted
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/quentin-tarantino-pulp-fiction-vincent-vega-3o7aTskHEUdgCQAXde
Bill: Owo is he THAT bad with returns?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): idk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe it was just one of the ones he was super excited about and sent to her early
Bill: SoooOoooo fucking dark. Wasn’t the point he wanted to use his flashes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think that was the aesthetic he was going for
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he wanted it backlit with the colored gels
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Kind of like what he did with these
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it very dark tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i raised my phone brightness to see if it was just me
Bill: Those. Are still dark as fuck though.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like I said, that's what he was going for
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): would they look better with additional front lighting? probably yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the problem with it being Yang's color is yellow which just kind of makes it look like a poorly lit photo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): with poor white balance
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i wish i knew what order he was doin photos in
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so in applying to NASA you actually apply to 15 projects at NASA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and are considered on an individual basis for each one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): meaning youre rejected from each project on its own
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): first rejection from a NASA project today 😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it was one of the more upper level ones and i wasnt super interested in it to begin with
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but that means rejections are starting to roll in
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): here's hoping at least one accepts you 🍻
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🤞
Bill: 🍻

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _im so anxious_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): there were rumors that choices were gonna start rolling in this friday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i guess there was some validity to that
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do you have any movies you want to binge or cosplay you want to make?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no 😭
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was watching santa clarita diet but i finished that today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i have class at 6:40
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im hoping i can run out all the anxiety at the gym later
Bill: Have faith. You worked hard and did your best so there’s thing to regret.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok just **do not** think about penguins.
N🆗ri (Marisa): You better not if i hear you’ve been thinking about penguins there’ll be a price to pay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

N🆗ri (Marisa): the grey will cover up everything
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seeing as my grey face paint is extremely oily I don't think that's a good idea
N🆗ri (Marisa): we'll just throw more powder on it
N🆗ri (Marisa): powder shower
N🆗ri (Marisa): look at all the characters you can cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): and there's even more if none of these catch your fancy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I love how my parents aren't fond of me having an Amazon Echo yet my dad is currently using Google voice search on his phone and I'm just like <:hmm:543194383885926403> *it's the same concept*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg but tHE GOverNMEnt is listening
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I never understood that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like who gives a fuck if the government sees me looking up how to pronounce penis 100 times and laughing every time the Alexa says it
N🆗ri (Marisa): when you're president they use it against u
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s so relatable it’ll get me more votes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ALEXA
