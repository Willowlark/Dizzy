Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I haven't voted yet, Marisa were you planning these on weekly basis or just until you get enough votes?
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I'mma set a reminder for tomorrow to vote
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): whenever the votes get filled. take yer time~
 weekly seems like a long span in between posts unless people want it to be weekly. I can do it daily or every 2/3 days if people are up for that too.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah I was thinking weekly was probably too long as well
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): update status: once every 3 years
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): if people have lots of questions or if someone poses a new option after most people have already casted a vote i'll extend the time too so people can consider the new option/info
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: YOSH
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I have voted
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo lemme go do that
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Yeah thatâ€™s weird my phone says you voted and shows five people but it says there are only theee reacts. Thatâ€™s really strange.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Iâ€™m around the corner from home anyway. I have mastered texting without looking so I hope Iâ€™m not typing gibberish
Bill: I'll vote shortly too.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ~~yâ€™all are such nerds, staying inside~~ ;3c
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THERES A STORM
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i don wanna get wet
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): valid emoji
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: WAIT WHERE IS THIS TOWN
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: What state? Or is that a secret for now
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: It okay if it secret for now
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Nah not a secret. I have a general area but let me look at a map for an exact state
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: General area is good too
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Southern Minnesota region, though since colonial expansion was so messed up and chaotic state lines are questionable.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ~~I know the forests are mainly in north Minnesota but dislsbshhshhhhhh theyâ€™re in the south now too~~
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: That fine ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ‘Œ
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Well probably with how nature is
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: The forest might have expanded
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): GOOD COVERUP
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I was thinking about transportation too
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Cars wouldn't exist it's too early but trains would have
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: However vines prob destroy the tracks
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Meaning the only form is horse
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: And if you can use a cart would spend on if there were roads or not
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Ye trains might be limited or slow, but certainly exist. Itâ€™s just about finding a track that gets cleared properly and opportune timing. Cities might have tramcars.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Roads exist but their conditions vary. Most major roads head from east to west rather than north to south.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we drive this

Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ya thereâ€™s one of those parked in the backyard
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): I do have a new post typed up, Iâ€™m gonna shower and then reread it to see if it makes sense because I have a horrible habit of never proofreading anything ever.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): If these posts get too long also tell me whoops
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Lots of description now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_car  somewhere deep in the recesses of my mind came the word "steam car" and that was apparetly a thing so not im gonna waste all my time reading this for no reason
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Hubba hubba

Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Oh man. Thereâ€™s a messed up anime plot I can take inspiration from. What show was it again. Hmmmmmm
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Iâ€™m hoping for a lot of twists in this, so Iâ€™ll warn yâ€™all now to be wary of any assumptions. ~~unless I suck at twists and they all become obvious lol~~
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Goes for things that are good and bad

Bill: Voted.
Bill: FYI text formatting doesn't work in code blocks.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): WOAH now THAT is a CAR
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): haha yyyeahh. Iâ€™ll probably just do normal text from now on. Wanted something to separate the first post from the stuff before it
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Can you emoji in block text?
â€˜â€™â€™<:lenny:395307171539189760>â€™â€™â€™
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Lol
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Emphasized lenny
Bill: Nope. Block text is designed to show everything you type literally, not parse `:lenny:` into <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): *ya'll also free to come up with extra action options any time*
i feel like this post makes it seem like i'm corralling her into the attic but that's not the case, staying is also a perfectly fine option
