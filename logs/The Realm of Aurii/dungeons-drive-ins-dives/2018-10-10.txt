Nokia 3310 (Marisa): if you want to do a one-time/one-day scenario with something small then it'd have to be a single mission, like the hideout raid arc (rescuing a hostage). what ideas do you have so far?

some random plots:
could try something like stalling for time until actual heroes arrive (since in canon most people's quirks are useless, especially for combat)
maybe whatever the protags want to do is good in their eyes but it's illegal in the eyes of the law so they have to fulfill their goal as 'villains' without being caught. vigilante justice sort of thing.
could be a rescue style mission. a field trip gone wrong where someone has to be saved in perilous conditions.
safely subduing a child who suddenly manifested an insanely strong quirk (like a toned down and modified version of the internship/eri arc).
someone with a unique quirk is causing trouble around town and no such quirk is registered at the ward office so you gotta be a detective and hunt them down
