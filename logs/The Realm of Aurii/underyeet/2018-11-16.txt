No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Oooo this Pokémon game is so weird I’m not used to it
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> memes?
Bill: <@&398644763043299328> We're one away for 6 man squad.
Bill: 
Bill: Pasty white blonde kid == Hispanic Mom?
Bill: He went from “old guy getting attacked by animal” to “old guy talking to a flock of birds”.
Bill: Me: throws poke ball
Eevee: learns quick attack
Bill: *since it’s pokemon go the console game, I wonder if I can turn them into candy*
Bill: Oh. There’s an actual mechanic for catching the same Pokémon over and over.
Bill: Oooh, rough, first battle is against Ryan Reynolds.
Bill: Also mechanic change, before paralysis made you go second in combat, it doesn’t anymore.
Bill: Did I do it right?
Bill: Your rival is extra retarded in this one.
Bill: “Oh yeah, I love her like a real sister. She’s been in my life forever. I could tell you anything about her, favorite food, hair style, number of ex’s...”
“Her name?”
“Well.”
“Uh.”
Bill: Ha you can mug people for pokeballs in addition to cash.
Bill: I am distinctly worried have one Pokémon box to use is going to be super confusing when you have to catch Pokémon to grind.
Bill: I didn’t see a release option either.
Bill: I wise crack, but I’m on the fence if throwing pokeballs endlessly is better or worse than grinding in crappy battles.
Bill: You can still grind them into candy!
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): 
Bill: Curb stomped Brock with Eevee’s double kick.
Bill: It is however the longest fight to date, every other trainer has had 1 Pokémon that dropped in 1 attack.
Bill: He has 2 that took 2 attacks.
Bill: Oh shit Blue is in the game.
Bill: No wonder the rival is a sped, Blue and Red are around.
Bill: Hopefully as BA as their manga versions.
Bill: Such great balls.
