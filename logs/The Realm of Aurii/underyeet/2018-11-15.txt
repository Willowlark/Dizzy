Bill: While I've stayed spoiler free on doki doki, I know a bit too much to not be waiting for the mental scarring.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): mental scarring? it's just about a normal school club
Bill: I question some of these words.
Bill: "Discuss (the book) if you wanted..." is supposed to be an innuendo right.
