NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I GOT HERMEOWNIE WOO
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'll prob pick up re2 after a price drop <@184437198865563648>
Bill: Oh really?
Bill: Didnâ€™t know that was your type of game.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Why not right, I like older games and I have played my fair share of horror
Bill: It plays similar to 4 and 5, but zombies are much harder to kill and you have limited responses to getting attacked. (No head stuns, non of that).
Dirty Lego (Tom): Head shots still deal more tho right
Bill: Ye....ah....?
Bill: Og-T virus zombies are resilient. Headshots occasionally have a bit of knockback and itâ€™s habit to shoot there for me... but Iâ€™ve dumped a dozen rounds into a skull without it dropping before.

Bill: Occasionally the headsâ€™ll pop and their dead dead.
Bill: There is a fallout miniatures game.
Bill: I did not know this. Like. With war game rules and paintable figures.
Bill: Finally went to the miniatures place in ledgewood. They have a membership free to play there, but they setup fancy terrain tables for you when you reserve a table and stuff. 25/6 months 50 for a year. Not that I want to spend half a grand on a miniatures game.
