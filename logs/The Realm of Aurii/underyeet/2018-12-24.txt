Bill: Wow it took me a really long time to find out enemies have levels and that’s why I’m not killing enemies in one shot anymore.
Bill: > stalking pair of mechanic saber tooth tigers that are field boss tier difficult
> hiding behind tree
> bandits walk up road 
> “I see you by that tree! Show yourself”
> bandits start the timer for spotting me
> *giant mechanic saber tooth tigers notice bandits*
> watches tigers go fucking ham on bandits
> no contest.wav
> move hiding spots in the battle so I don’t get spotted
> eventually kill tigers, after aggro resets.
Bill: I thought this was going to be a Nier joke.
Bill: I’m disappointed.

デイブ: My plan is to do borderlands 2, borderlands, then pre sequel
Bill: I'm on board for anything where I can get a similar level character. I know pre sequel just started, I'm assuming borderlands 2 is beyond entry level and it's crap shoot if any of my characters are that level.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): nah just for me and jess
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): borderlands 2 is lvls 40-52
Bill: I dunno what my characters were at...
Bill: Check later.
Bill: Level 8 Lawbringer.
Bill: for Pre Sequel.
Bill: don't have borderlands 2 installed on the new machine, whoops.
Bill: Level 44 mechromancer, commando at 33.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): can't believe a game lets you wear no clothing at level 33
Bill: haha.
デイブ: 👍
