One hop this time (Tom): wow pewds did?
One hop this time (Tom): i didnt realize he still played games
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Ye I think he‚Äôs much more relaxed about it now. Like, he‚Äôs already reached the top so he just does whatever he wants instead of trying to be popular.
One hop this time (Tom): yeah i used to watch him back in the day, but he eventually became a shitpost channel so i dipped
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): YEAH that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like his videos very much. He‚Äôs done some problematic stuff too. I‚Äôm hoping jacksepticeye picks it up. Or ray or vinny but I doubt those two.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): so people are agreeing there's probably gonna be a full version of Don't Forget when the game is fully complete (i'm hoping for bits of the song to come out as each chapter is released a la steven universe's ending song), and some are theorizing that the final song is gonna be Don't Forget that turns into Once Upon a Time and it's gonna mess everyone up in the feels.
someone made a really really good mock up and it is Strong.
