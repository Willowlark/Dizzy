Bill: Bless Zelda. Girl’s a mage, smart enough to wear caprees under dem skirts, full capable of kicking ass and tacking names herself. 

*meanwhile the face of the Nintendo female characters is the one who uses turnips and kitchen implants as weapons*
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Don’t u trash Peach she’s amazing 
Queen of sports, she has a void of nonexistence under her skirt, can absolutely wreck a person, and also yeah the turnips are cool they have faces of them.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Who hurt him
Bill: Zelda > Peach
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 2B added to soul Cal today
Bill: YEEEEET
Bill: I've been using my switch controller with my switch for smash...
Bill: And repairing it to the PC is a pain in the butt...
Bill: ~~clearly I need to buy another one~~
Bill: > Opens Soul Cal
> Goes to Select 2B
> 2B wins
> Victory animation
> A letter falls from top of screen, 2B grabs it and reads it
> 2B: "2B units are not unique... this unit can be in many places at once..."
> 2B walks off screen
> Camera zooms in on letter
> the seal is the smash symbol
> 2B JOINS THE BATTLE FOR HUMANITY
Bill: 
Bill: I *love* her design for ultimate.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah it's cute
