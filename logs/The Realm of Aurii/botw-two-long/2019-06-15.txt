Tikur (Kurtis): 
Bill: Scottish Chan is waifs
Bill: I miss mystic messenger, the content in this VN post the extended prolog is CRAAAAP
Bill: > bump into heroine shopping 
> “sorry I’m shopping”
> relationship ding
> cut to next segment
Bill: *Are you fucking kidding me another bad end*
Bill: Two hours of stupid nonsense wasted!
Bill: According to google and context clues in a Japanese guide I picked one of the hardest routes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof
Bill: Fuck VNs. I don’t need the constant anxiety if I’m bonding with given person enough.
Bill: Too close to real life man, this is escapism!
Bill: The prologue was way better cause the choices were far and few between and the content was better. The main game is like “choose where in town to go during morning, day, night; hope you run into someone to bond with them for literally 5 lines; repeat through all of August”
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oof
Bill: There’s a guide on YouTube I GUESS I’ll do that?
Bill: But like.
Bill: Whatever.
Bill: I could probably just watch the ending online and not miss anything, cause the main game is so shitty.
