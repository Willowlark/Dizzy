Nokri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Rip porco
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Gon go catch me a real man

Bill: <@!141729881779077121> <@!301927856240459777> there’s a question after the prologue which is “which region did you come from”. I’m not sure yet, but it might house lock you. I’m only able to mingle with golden deer students in the meet and greet tutorial hell following.
Bill: Oop I’m wrong.
Bill: “You’ve never taught anywhere, have no traceable history, have been a mercenary your entire life, are young enough to <:lenny:395307171539189760> students, but we’re giving you pick of the house you want to teach. Now that you’ve had a chance to look at them.”
Bill: “It’d be strange if they were; this is a dating sim after all”
Bill: IM DEAD
Bill: Realization: I should ship the favorite girl with Claude rather than the protagonist.
