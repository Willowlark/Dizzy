Nokri (Marisa): Good discussion in the game today
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHH WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): a good discussion
Nokri (Marisa): I’m losing it over this speech
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's like a whole new language
Nokri (Marisa): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cow Elmo. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.
Nokri (Marisa): And yes, by the way, i DO have a cow elmo tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
