Bill: ~~I know nothing about this game except Jess would probably like it~~
Bill: Oh okay Nintendo. Apparently 6:57 on release day is too early to play cadence of hyrule.
Bill: Thanks for the added time stipulation you told no one about.
Bill: “There are better places to take a nap”
Bill: I bought a visual novel on switch. Let’s see if I can play VNs this way.
Bill: Dis bitch wakes you up so you don’t miss your train. 

fact check: some 50 year old Indian dude is going to wake you up if you are still asleep in the station, and he’ll do it by boppin your shoulder. Not asking you 20 questions.
Bill: Further fact check: who the fuck wants to be woken up from a nap on the train to hearing all about some strangers job?
Bill: ~~nah but I’ve heard the tale of the four maidens that close enough?~~
Bill: I don’t know much about the story other than it got good reviews online, but the art is fucking beautiful and the backgrounds/faces are animated. Voicing is good too, including the protagonist which afaik is a rarity.
Bill: ~~because it’s a visual novel~~
Bill: > protagonist: goes to bed 
> protagonist: wakes up to find girl in bed
> protagonist: “this is is such a cliche”
At least you lampshade it.
Bill: Though I’m getting higurashi vibes.
Bill: FUCK this 6 character limit on names.
Bill: Kyousuke is not a long name.
Bill: *saying she’s your really distant cousin is not a turn on Japan stop no*

*saying it four times in the same conversation is worse*
Bill: *underage drinking on a Nintendo console?*
Bill: Oh of course it was JUST candy.
Bill: Commit japan!
Bill: What a surprise.
Bill: +1 generic, hyper active, slightly perverted but kind hearted male best friend character
Bill: Yoosung + Unknown
Bill: Or maybe Seven?
Bill: Oh look a new club in school with my home room teacher and bunch of hot girls that’s exclusive and ^ can’t get into. Based around solving mysteries around the towns urban legends.
Bill: ~~stop me if you’ve heard that before~~
Bill: <:facepalm:583111880990523394>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thats just kyo with an earring
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: What a surprise.
Bill: Protagonist also writes 100 pages in a single night.
Bill: Now we’ve found the generic rich blond girl getting harassed by seniors where you generically step in!
Bill: Only to be interrupted byyyy
Bill: Her hot butler(?)!
Bill: Brother.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That's that dude from final fantasy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ignis
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also yeah that sounds. Like higurashi
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ABORT
El🆓de Faun (Tom): A B O R T
Bill: Nah man I’m here for the higurashi not the hot for teacher shit.
Bill: Also Kensuke (~~Sunohara~~ the best friend) is chicken shit when blond rich girl whose family controls the town economy is getting harassed so he can’t be Kyo.
Bill: Sounds a bit like Kyo tho.
Bill: Backwater town thriving on the one company that was founded there filled with urban legends? Still has a maid cafe where your classmate (of course the cold, serious one) works!
Bill: Can I ship the cousin and not Kyo. He called her (maimi) Mikes and it’s about as much basis as any my hero ship.
Bill: Depth for a male character. Nah man.
Bill: Oh he asked her out before.
Bill: ~~characters who’ve had relationships before the main character came along? Is this even anime?~~
Bill: Maid-Chan’s brother seems to have issues with buttons on shirts as well.
Bill: I appreciate there’s a good amount of male characters tho.
Bill: Beyond ~~sunohara~~ Kensuke.
Bill: Fucking rich girls.
Bill: ~~what a surprise I’m in the club~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nice background
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The Doki Doki club
Bill: Last for is probably an idol.
Aldus Larian (Jess): He looks like kyo tho
Bill: Yuuuup
Bill: 
Bill: He sounds like Kyo too.
Bill: Not kyo is saying how much like Kyo he is.
Bill: “Kyo but not actually”
Bill: Reasons why photographers have a bad rep #23
Bill: Yo what English voice lines?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ? ? ? ?
Bill: 
Bill: I like cousin Chan.
Bill: Too bad she’s your cousin 30 times removed.
Bill: Idols manager yells at dick freelancer in English, which she is “infamous for doing when mad”.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof
Bill: Wait I think train girl is a route so I have one too many heroines.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: YES
Bill: Gotta say the moving backgrounds and character images make a difference in not getting bored.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh nice
Bill: Weird for VNs, you can only save at particular points.
Bill: *Please Nintendo*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <@245270932602486784>  they released a second comic for Lux

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE BUT I THINK YOU GOTTA PAY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh you don’t
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HOORAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YO THIS ONE IS REALLY GOOD
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Sylas is really neet
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also lux forced into getting an arranged marriage with Jarvan is a really neet twist on the lore
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _spicy_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I like that they changed Demacia to persecute mages
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _not a fan of Luxs weird crush on Sylas tho_
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If they do the third comic sylas terrifies her so it won't last
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And yeah me niether but she's supposed to be younger in the comic than in the game
Bill: 
Bill: Ah yes. Japanese teenagers have no idea what sex euphemisms are cause they’re “pure”.
Bill: Unless they’re ~~sunohara~~ token male pervert friend.
Bill: 
Bill: He may be a dork but that outfit quality.
Bill: First body wooooo
Bill: So the story telling isn’t linear, like a lot of VNs. Lot of jumping around... || we jump to home after we find missing students bag in the river? Then cousin and I talk and she asks are you hiding something, to which I reply “I killed her”. 

Cut to next day. No no no I need the rest of that conversation. ||
