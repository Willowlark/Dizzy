El氣電e Faun (Tom): confsesionals is post game stuff?
El氣電e Faun (Tom): does the host of the show have access to everything
Nokri (Marisa): hosts have access to everything yee
confessionals is the equivalent of going in front of the camera on a reality show
like uhhh
Nokri (Marisa): like when it shows two people talking, and then suddenly cuts away and shows this
Nokri (Marisa): and the guy's like "oh my gosh can u believe that other person"
that's a confessoinal!
El氣電e Faun (Tom): wait so like were players allowed to post there but couldnt see anyone elses
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!!
We each have diary rooms, that are basically confessional booths. players could go into and talk. That's entirely private, only the player and the hosts can see into the diary rooms.
If we wanted to, we could do a VL diary entry. It's basically a regular confessional except we put VL in front of it, and that will be shown to all the viewers watching the game take place. people in the game can't see it, just the viewers outside.
El氣電e Faun (Tom): woahh
