El氣電e Faun (Tom): Vishnal told me that I need to stop the Sechs <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): Listen to him
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Yoo
El氣電e Faun (Tom): I did not realize so many things
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Your staff affects your magic damg with spells

El氣電e Faun (Tom): 沽ｱ 沽ｱ 沽ｱ
El氣電e Faun (Tom): I need a better staff
El氣電e Faun (Tom): These dark blobs are too much
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!
The dark blobs suck, I think it窶冱 implied that ||theyre failed experiments who used to be human|| or something? Are you on Maya road :3c

I know a recipe for the perfect staff!! It takes a ton of MP but it窶冱 widely considered the best staff in the whole game hold up
El氣電e Faun (Tom): I'm heading into the sech region not suree
Nokri (Marisa): I can窶冲 remember the recipe for my cool staff, I窶冤l have Barrett appraise it and tell me what I did with it. I know it窶冱 at least been upgraded with a dragon bone from the boss in revival cave, a rainbow watering pot to vastly decrease the spell casting time, a drop from horse Dylas (his mane I think?), glitta augite, and tenfold steel. I think you can get all of those materials.
Nokri (Marisa): With the level of staff I have it basically one hit KOs everything, or two/three hit KOs the harder bosses over level 800
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Woahh
