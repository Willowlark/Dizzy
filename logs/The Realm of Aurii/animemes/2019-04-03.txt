N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: The first image isn’t loading and I’m not sure if it’s discord or the new phone. =/
Bill: Oh there it goes.
Bill: I mean, Deku got a bunch of personality traits that translate well to a female character.
Bill: I kinda get it.
Bill: But deku wouldn’t be a girl, cause author can’t write female main characters.

N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): waka so pure
Bill: So hopeless. TT
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): too good too pure
Bill: Man I need to reread the series.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH it's so good
and still quality
Bill: stop I already did NO work yesterday, I need to get stuff done today.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna reread ffak because it's been so long since an update i can't remember anything anymore and idk where i left off.
but. i don't want to go through that again. not twice.
Bill: ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): feast for a king
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's got every trigger/nsfw warning under the sun but it a good story
i try to block out the grossness
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: ```This comic contains lots ADULT CONTENT [18+!!] and is NSFW, so please keep in mind if you wish to read it.

N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's it!
N🆗ri (Marisa): a summary of ffak:
Aldus Larian (Jess): you forget it because your brain censored out 99% of it
N🆗ri (Marisa): that is exactly it
N🆗ri (Marisa): and i binged the first like 10 chapters so that helps compress the gross stuff to make it easier to censor
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): that sounds terrible
N🆗ri (Marisa): not my fault there's not enough manga in the world and kosmic is a great storyteller
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll start rereading after paper's backstory because i remember that
Bill: You gotta try fanfiction.
N🆗ri (Marisa): WAIT THE SITE HASN'T UPDATED WHAT
BUT KOSMIC'S BEEN SHARING NEW PAGES?? are they for her patreon members only??
N🆗ri (Marisa): ehhhh but fanfiction isn't canon
Bill: I can give you multiple multi million word fictions.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that sounds horrifying
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa plz
Aldus Larian (Jess): what's horrifying is reading whatever THAT is
Bill: Black Bond is better than actual Harry Potter canon...RWBY loops is amusing. Haven't read MLP loops but that's as long if not longer than RWBY.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH THAT REMINDS ME my fav fic should update tomorrow bless
N🆗ri (Marisa): same author as nasty red dogs which is also neat
Aldus Larian (Jess): that just SOUNDS terrible
N🆗ri (Marisa): so good
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): does this also have all the warnings
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmmm. nasty red dogs has..... violence and cannibalism and nudity and suicide warnings but i think that's it?
Aldus Larian (Jess): "this is my sweet friend marisa, she is a literal angel, except she reads the most fucked up webcomics ever."
N🆗ri (Marisa): i haven't kept up with killing stalking it's too gross
Bill: ~~she kinky~~ :leny
N🆗ri (Marisa):

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I found the list of chat times for MM and got really worried when the 11:05 chat didn't show up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then 11:50 rolled around and I realized it was a typo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then I remembered the same thing happened the last time lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): no cheating on mystic mess
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): too late
