Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Nokri (Marisa): ~~how did you know~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~*were you thinking the same thing*~~
Aldus (Jess): not today but ive thought it before
Aldus (Jess): ~~who is it~~
Nokri (Marisa): There was a male yoko cosplay on insta by someone from the rwby group I think. It was really good and had all the yoko motifs but *long pants and a shirt*
Nokri (Marisa): Male yoko would be at most booty shorts and a crop top
Nokri (Marisa): Hair spot on tho
Aldus (Jess): ooo yeaaaa hes done other things with crop tops too

Nokri (Marisa): Is he the go to crop top guy
Aldus (Jess): ya hedid
Bill: Crop top guy is Ryan.
Aldus (Jess): all three of them are completely ok with exposing their midsection
Nokri (Marisa): only one can reign supeeme
Nokri (Marisa): The croppiest of tops
Bill: That's what I'm saying, Ryan would win.
Aldus (Jess): true
Aldus (Jess): ryan will make the genderbend more fanservicy
Bill: ```Hyakuren no Haou to Seiyaku no Valkyria (The Master of Ragnarok & Blesser of Einherjar), which wins the Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii Desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii Desu ka? Memorial Most Light Novel Sounding Name Award is yet, sigh, another isekai light novel. The twist, sigh, is that the protagonist gets spirited away to another world with his iPhone. It‚Äôs an original concept that has never been done before. So surprise, surprise, the otherwise loser male lead leverages the power of apps (and Wikipedia) to rise to power and surround himself with a harem of nubile haremettes who want to do nothing but sex him day and night. He doesn‚Äôt indulge himself to the generous melonpan and thigh buffet because he‚Äôs saving his virginity for his actual little sister or something. It‚Äôs like this show has taken the worst parts of harem anime from the 1990s combined it with the worst parts of harem anime from the 2000s and then combined it with the worst parts of modern isekai harem anime.```
Bill: The only thing I need from anime is the sarcastic reviews.
Bill: `(When are we getting the first anime with Fortnite? Maybe a loser male lead gets transported into another world, but his lit Fortnite building skills somehow becomes an advantage in that dark, twisted fantasy world?)`
Nokri (Marisa): Shuumatsu is so sad
Nokri (Marisa): Could be sadder. We need more sad.
Nokri (Marisa): That author sighs a lot is they ok
Elfriede (Tom): I am also okay with exposing my mid section, I just have yet to do so
Elfriede (Tom): Cept shirtless Adam that one day
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): Crop top tom theyll call you
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
