Aldus (Jess): I did it. I got Vs route. And wow that last VN section was brutal
Nokri (Marisa): V'S ROUTE SECURED
Nokri (Marisa): WOO
Aldus (Jess): ~~😭 tears of happiness I swear~~
Nokri (Marisa): "no one will recognize me if i wear this hood"
Nokri (Marisa): all MC has to do to escape is put on a hood
Aldus (Jess): Omg that's the best part thou
Aldus (Jess): "no one will recognize my bright blue hair, esspcially not this woman who I was engaged too"
Aldus (Jess): I love when v first gets to mint eye and ray is like "hey you look familiar??? Oh NVM I gotta go see mc idc"
Nokri (Marisa): "gardening at night is a perfectly normal occupation"
Aldus (Jess): YA! Ommggg what even is this game
Aldus (Jess): It's so hard to be mean to ray though shit this text gave me anxiety:
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH IT FEELS SO BAD
Nokri (Marisa): feelsbadman.jpg
Aldus (Jess): "everyone I've ever know has betrayed me but you'll stay right?" 😭😭😭😭
Nokri (Marisa): give us the epilogue for ray's story cheritz
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): 😭 nooooo
Aldus (Jess): Take him with youuuuu
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): There was a call today with seven talking about splitting ice cream with "the most important person" and then like 4 hours later Ray's like "yea I like ice cream" and THE FEELS we're real
Nokri (Marisa): *oh no the ice cream*
Nokri (Marisa): didn't they bring that up in seven's route too
or somewhere
Aldus (Jess): I think?
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Yoosung thinks he hates V the most... Psh ain't got nothing on ya boi
Aldus (Jess): ~~i like how it gets translated to "ice creams" with an s~~
Nokri (Marisa): the V Hate Olympics, feat. mostly people who are related to one another
Aldus (Jess): Rika, ray, yoosung, seven kinda ish? In his own route at least
Aldus (Jess): Jumins the V defense squad tho
Nokri (Marisa): vanderwood maybe? for dragging seven away from his work and because of all the stuff from the secret ending? maybe
jumin throws money to distract everyone but joke's on him that only works for yoosung
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): OH YEA vandy too
Nokri (Marisa): "i don't know who you are but u suck" - vanderwood
Aldus (Jess): Lol I loved the part where vanderwood was basically (heavy paraphrase) like "you dated that psycho?" And vs like "ye"
Nokri (Marisa): "stop judging me"
"well there's not much else to do in this jail cell"
Aldus (Jess): Vanderwood route when
Aldus (Jess): All the sass
Nokri (Marisa): people have been asking for it!! especially since another story. we probably won't get it 😭
cheritz is like "these fans just won't stop ahh. next thing they'll want a tom route too"
Aldus (Jess): Lmao I've seen people joke about a driver Kim route 😂
Nokri (Marisa): driver kim route when
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Aldus (Jess): Yea!
Aldus (Jess): Lmao
Aldus (Jess): Seriously though can we get more than 5 last names in this game srsly
Nokri (Marisa): only 5 last names exist in the world it is law
Aldus (Jess): Do they ever say rikas last name?
Nokri (Marisa): naw, that isn't even her real name. i assume her last name could be Kim? 50/50 chance because Yoosung
Aldus (Jess): Yeee that's why I was asking so like if she did marry V she wouldn't have even had to change it lol
Nokri (Marisa): TRUE
Aldus (Jess): But it seems like they are related through yoosing and rikas moms so 🤷
Nokri (Marisa): she was adopted so not blood relation
~~yoosung had a chance with her~~
Aldus (Jess): Yea dat too rip
Eliran (Halim): its a 1/4 chance of being kim
Eliran (Halim): Cause its either
2 moms 
Rika Mom Yoo Dad
Yoo Mom Rika Dad 
or 2 Dads
Kim only happens when they both are related through fathers
Aldus (Jess): Ye
Aldus (Jess): It's ok there's only 4 other names it could be
Nokri (Marisa): Oh no I’m horrible at math I don’t get it
Nokri (Marisa): maybe i get it a little
Aldus (Jess): Oh I just said that cuz everyone one in the game has one of 5 last names
Aldus (Jess): Basically you and your cousin will only have the same last name if your father's are brothers
Nokri (Marisa): no ye
i'm confused at the 1/4
but is it like. Yoosung has that last name because of his dad an
yeah
Nokri (Marisa): yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeahh
Nokri (Marisa): unless the mother's last name was also kim before marriage <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Lmao true
Aldus (Jess): So yea if yoosung dad's brother is rikas dad then she a Kim but if yoosings dad's mom is rikas mom then no
Aldus (Jess): Well that was educational
