Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): MIRAI

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): WHOLESOME
Bill: MOVIE OF THE YEAR
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): Mirai no Mirai? Really? It’s my least favorite movie from that studio oops
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): The train station was cool, I got to visit a real life recreation of it too, but I felt the film was weak. What’s your favorite parts about it
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): are you maybe talking about kyoukai no kanata: mirai hen or kara no kyoukai: mirai fukuhin.
some other mirai movie.
Bill: Mirai no Mirai. So cute.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): !!!!!!??????
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): really??!?
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): ~~begins your waifu is trash debate~~ that's a valid opinion
have you seen other stuff from studio chizu.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i have all their movies ~~except mirai because i didn't like it as much as their others~~
maybe i had way too high expectations of it
lets movie marathon
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): was it the screaming. whoever voiced kun-chan did a great job at screaming.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I cry alot, so cute I die
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So wholesome
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I haven't seen wolf children or boy and the beast
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): To be fair I didn't watch wolf children because I had heard it was sad
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): omg you need to see wolf children
and boy and the beast. admittedly that one wasn't as good as i hoped but it was still pretty decent
omg yeah watch wolf children i'll bring the DVD over <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'll add em both to my list
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): also the girl who leapt through time is a classic and the first big name movie for the studio
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Mirai was so cute,I cried for the entire second half of the movie
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Wholesome tears
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): and summer wars that was good
Bill: It’s the same theme as those two. Wolf children is motherhood, boy and the beast is fatherhood, and Mirai is siblings.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He called his grandpa daddy in the flashback because he was a ***daddy***
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): really??? maybe i have to watch it again but i left the theater very unimpressed

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You nerds with your "studios" and your "expectations"
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): don't trust their food though. i went to a cafe for it once and ordered shaved ice and it was literally a giant bowl of ice. i was so hydrated.
Bill: Yeah the parents are RELATIONSHIP goals, the kids are chaos but it’s so nice to see that chaos from a parents viewpoints.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea it was too real ™
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): if you liked this movie then you'll love the rest of the films ~~because mirai was weak~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah and the flash backs with the parents were so cute from the child perspective
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): i ate this and it was just pure unflavored ice in a bowl
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): When he patted the moms head
Bill: Like, after he flashbacked to his mom when he said he didn’t like her, it cut to his mom calling him he angel and I’m just.

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Just go get your leg blown up in a war

No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): boro the caterpillar was literally a poo massacre
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): they then ate the poo
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Look he just trolling now
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I found out the anime was a mistake quote is actually this line:
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): You see, whether you can draw like this or not, being able to think up this kind of design, it depends on whether or not you can say to yourself, ‘Oh, yeah, girls like this exist in real life. If you don’t spend time watching real people, you can’t do this, because you’ve never seen it. Some people spend their lives interested only in themselves. Almost all Japanese animation is produced with hardly any basis taken from observing real people, you know. It’s produced by humans who can’t stand looking at other humans. And that’s why the industry is full of otaku!.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): So wise
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He's like apple he know people are still gonna watch whatever he makes 😂
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): 
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): YEAH he knows people will eat it so so he's like "let them eat poo"

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): There is a big separation between them tho cuz Mirai all in all was a very real modern family

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I feel like if I saw them first I might think the same

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no i dont i dont really know much about the site
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i just made an account like a month? ago
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): discover is where people start! anyone can upload there, there's a TON of stuff and updates are very irregular depending on the comic. featured is the big series and those are the money makers. everything starts out in discovered and then once it gets popular enough they license it and restart the series from the beginning on featured
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): that's why some early chapters of series will have comments like "discover squad assemble"
