Elfriede Faun (Tom): W A T
Bill: E...every chat in the last 8 hours is Seven and Yoosung talking about honey butter chips.
Bill: Fairy gone has potential.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok, so Seven said he's considered V his father for over ten years which means he would be about 10-11 years old when he started working for the agency. V is five years older which makes him 15-16 years old when he "adopted" Seven...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea pretty much 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven didn't leave home till he was like 15-16
Aldus Larian (Jess): So I guess even though seven considered V his dad (cuz like what other option does he have) he didn't "take seven in until V was more like 20 ish? I think idk the MM timelines is a joke 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): So I'm assuming you got that chatroom that V "lost service" during?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yup
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then Seven denounced his distrust of V and told everyone about Saeran's existence and everyone's like WTF
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and only Jumin really cares about the party anymore
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA!
N🆗ri (Marisa): marie is really posting a lot of lets play lewds
N🆗ri (Marisa): she on some kind of binge?

N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm glad they made a new tier offering a non-lewd print
N🆗ri (Marisa): throwback to the homestuck kickstarter being the most funded kickstarter of all time and raising insane money when it existed
N🆗ri (Marisa): still says locked but they're 2k over that tier also
Bill: ~~salty there's no charles?~~
