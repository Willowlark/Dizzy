Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I get those at work and they make me lol so much
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hello!

My nickname in darknet is clemente28.
I hacked this mailbox more than six months ago, through it I infected your operating system with a virus (trojan) created by me and have been monitoring you for a long time.

Please check "from_address" for this email. You will see what I wrote this letter to you from yours account.

Even if you changed the password after that - it does not matter, my virus intercepted all the caching data on your computer and automatically saved access for me.

I have access to all your accounts, social networks, email, browsing history.
Accordingly, I have the data of all your contacts, files from your computer, photos and videos.

I was most struck by the intimate content sites that you occasionally visit.
You have a very wild imagination, I tell you!

During your pastime and entertainment there, I took screenshot through the camera of your device, synchronizing with what you are watching.
Oh my god! You are so funny and excited!

I think that you do not want all your contacts to get these files, right?
If you are of the same opinion, then I think that $764 is quite a fair price to destroy the dirt I created.

Send the above amount on my BTC wallet (bitcoin): 13imy3S2nBKu5itBiik7ZAEz5KsDGS6FhG
As soon as the above amount is received, I guarantee that the data will be deleted, I do not need it.

Otherwise, these files and history of visiting sites will get all your contacts from your device.
Also, I'll send to everyone your contact access to your email and access logs, I have carefully saved it!

Since reading this letter you have 48 hours!
After your reading this message, I'll receive an automatic notification that you have seen the letter.

I hope I taught you a good lesson.
Do not be so nonchalant, please visit only to proven resources, and don't enter your passwords anywhere!
Good luck!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): esspecailly the part where they are like "you should take better care of your passwords"
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): oh
oh wow
they're so polite omg
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Since reading this letter you have 48 hours! ðŸ˜„
Bill: this is. really hilarious.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ask them to be our friend
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): clemente28-chan
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): every time i get one i just pretend its unkown and lol
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): "hey hot stuff"
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): "how's rika"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the somewhat-off English just makes it that much better
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im reading the others i have they are all too funny
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): do you ever respond?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah u cant cuz they are from your own email if u hit reply
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): *the e-mails are coming from* ***inside*** *your e-mail* <:woah:543194447345876998>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'll begin with the most important.

I hacked your device and then got access to all your accounts... Including techtalk@c-techtraining.com.
It is easy to check - I wrote you this email from your account.

Moreover, I know your intim secret, and I have proof of this.
You do not know me personally, and no one paid me to check you.

It is just a coincidence that I discovered your mistake.
In fact, I posted a malicious code (exploit) to an adult site, and you visited this site... 

While watching a video Trojan virus has been installed on your device through an exploit.
This darknet software working as RDP (remote-controlled desktop), which has a keylogger, which gave me access to your microphone and webcam.
Soon after, my software received all your contacts from your messenger, social network and email.

At that moment I spent much more time than I should have. 
I studied your love life and created a good video series.
The first part shows the video that you watched, and the second part shows the video clip taken from your webcam (you are doing inappropriate things).

Honestly, I want to forget all the information about you and allow you to continue your daily life.
And I will give you two suitable options. Both are easy to do.
First option: you ignore this email.
The second option: you pay me $750(USD).
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): doesnt even send a greeting RUDE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "i made all these videos of you, but id like to forget, so pay me"
Bill: Yes, cause I log in to my work email before I look at porn.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ask to play 2-person minesweeper together through the remote controlled desktop
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this isnt even my account its like a side account im just copied on
Bill: pfft.
Bill: Who the fuck would use RDP for a keylogger anyway.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the first time i got one a couldn't stop laughing
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): save them all and make an album
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): really fancy scrapbook like one
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): woah apparently ffak just hit 5000 pages! :0
