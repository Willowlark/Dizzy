Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): it looks like simon is wearing pants there but no he's not. just shoes and a shirt.
Elfriede (Tom): Is that a webcomicM
Nokri (Marisa): yee!
Nokri (Marisa): http://ffak.kosmicdream.com/chapters
Elfriede (Tom): 13 chapters, not bad, is it new?
Elfriede (Tom): 2014, relatively new
Nokri (Marisa): ye! it's very uh violent and inappropriate though. i rush through those parts but i dunno if you got a warning when you got to the site, this isn't a comic you wanna read on a big screen in public
Nokri (Marisa): it has like every warning known to man
Elfriede (Tom): Oop
Elfriede (Tom): Yep
Elfriede (Tom): Those are dicks
Aldus (Jess): Marisa that's illegal you can read that
Nokri (Marisa): tom how far did you read
i just run past them really fast and then forget about them
Elfriede (Tom): I scrolled randomly
Nokri (Marisa): the characters are very pure if also beacons of sin
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): theres one chapter that's basically just all inappropriate between dylan and crimson while fork is dying, but that's because crimson feels guilty and wants to save dylan so they're trying to save dylan meanwhile dylan just wants to die
Aldus (Jess): Uhhh?
Aldus (Jess): Sounds great!
Nokri (Marisa): also i really like paper she's adorable
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!!
Nokri (Marisa): paper used to be a bunny
Nokri (Marisa): not an actual bunny since she's a worm but a good bean
Nokri (Marisa): Is this MC and small saeran
Nokri (Marisa): *jess it's a new day i see you are awake now have you checked mystic mess*
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> Hardcore Henry is on Netflix.
Nokri (Marisa): jess did you get all the 707 chats
Nokri (Marisa): i think uh. my game glitched. it's a pretty plot twisty glitch.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): Jumins number one fan
Aldus (Jess): I did! I got all the 707 o e I haven't got them all today yet
Nokri (Marisa): you got the seven one where he was making fun of vanderwood and jumin wanted to buy vandy? :3c
Aldus (Jess): Yea!
Aldus (Jess): I think evey route makes me hate Rika more and more üòÆ
Nokri (Marisa): oh boy <:lenny:395307171539189760> you'll just love today
Aldus (Jess): I can feel it allready
Aldus (Jess): ~~oh good he's finally sleeping~~
Aldus (Jess): or comatosed but w/e beggars cant be choosers
Bill: But what about the Rika route. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): ~~fuck dat shit~~
Elfriede (Tom): Give Rika route
Bill: üå∂
Bill: I mean....
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): i dont think i ever got the top one
Nokri (Marisa): good das a bad ending
Aldus (Jess): oh ok yea never got dat
Bill: Ye.
Bill: V's bad story 1.
Nokri (Marisa): it's essentially a hate romance
Nokri (Marisa): biru the ending expert
Bill: Doesn't MC basically say 'stop hurting V and you can have me'.
Aldus (Jess): LOL isnt that what V  tried to do all the time?
Nokri (Marisa): naw not for that route. for that one you have to continuously question V, and then when you meet rika just constantly praise her
Aldus (Jess): V:"hurt me" MC: "no hurt me" V:"no me"
Aldus (Jess): omg lmao
Aldus (Jess): the game is still giving me options to praise her and promise to rule minty eye together and im like BICH NO
Nokri (Marisa): just in case u change your mind
Bill: ``` Rika agrees with the player that it's best to just let V go. The player reminds Rika that she doesn't need V now that she has her, and it dawns to Rika that she can truly be loved instead of bound to a blinding obsession like V's love was now that she has the player by her side.```
Nokri (Marisa): meanwhile v's drugged up in the basement
Bill: *Meanwhile bad ending 2 where MC has orgys in front of V to break his heart*
Aldus (Jess): whooo! so much fun to be had
Aldus (Jess): doesnt he like enjoy it tho?
Nokri (Marisa): she isn't breaking his heart she's doing it for art or whatever. V's love is unconditional, that's what turned rika away, so he'd love MC literally no matter what she's doing
Bill: Ye, no, that's... not how that works.
Nokri (Marisa): that's how he be
Nokri (Marisa): literally why the cult exists
Aldus (Jess): yeet
Aldus (Jess): "you love me too much imma start a cult"
Nokri (Marisa): "haha wow sweetie you're so amazing and perfect. go ahead."
Aldus (Jess): "no... wait... dont... gooo"
Nokri (Marisa): JAPANESE NETFLIX HAS AVATAR WOO
Aldus (Jess): WHOO
Nokri (Marisa): so much to watch but idk what to watch
Nokri (Marisa): OH i'm gonna watch the golden compass that'll be a trainwreck
Nokri (Marisa): nevermind that's a trainwreck.
Elfriede (Tom): AVATAR FORM, YIPYIP

Aldus (Jess): Omg jumin
Nokri (Marisa): OH I THINK THIS IS THE GOOD CHAT
Nokri (Marisa): "didn't your parents buy you an island"
Nokri (Marisa): how did that chat end
Aldus (Jess): "farewell to the last vacation of my lifetime" LMAO
Nokri (Marisa): thank for ur insta message i'm almost done my headband and the clay is drying ; u;
Aldus (Jess): WHOO YOU CAN DO IT
Nokri (Marisa): did they talk about servants?
Aldus (Jess): jumin said  "Van" was a volunteer looking for his "long lost friend"
Nokri (Marisa): YES
Nokri (Marisa): oh van. van. wow. van.
Aldus (Jess): lmao rest in peace 707
Nokri (Marisa): "Apparently Van is short for his true name."
<:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus (Jess): YEA lmfao
Nokri (Marisa): this and the pearl one are so good
Aldus (Jess): seven "im gonna swim away now"

Aldus (Jess): still sad i missed ray wanting to go to the beach lol
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): and sevens says "like iron man?" except its not iron man its some other name and i cant remeber
Nokri (Marisa): ~~bootleg iron man~~
Aldus (Jess): *checks YouTube comments on i am the strongest*

Nokri (Marisa): were there spoilers
Nokri (Marisa): lots of heart and crying emoji
Aldus (Jess): no lmao some girl like "i hate searan/ray" and then fighting
Nokri (Marisa): FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
Aldus (Jess): "his abuse doesnt justify his actions"
Aldus (Jess): YEA NO SHIT
Nokri (Marisa): *learning that is his whole arc*
Aldus (Jess): RIGHT like omg
Aldus (Jess): and then shes like "everyone was abused in this game and they didnt go as far as him"
Nokri (Marisa): ah yes. the abuse of jumin "i got an island at age 7" han.
Aldus (Jess): LMFAO
Aldus (Jess): must have been so hard
Nokri (Marisa): truly tragic for him
Aldus (Jess): it was a comment trainwreck
Aldus (Jess): oo someone wrote and sang lyrics for endless struggle
Nokri (Marisa): oh yeah. i didn't like it too much, if it's the same one i saw. fancovers are extremely hit or miss imo
Aldus (Jess): yea it was ok
Nokri (Marisa): and the people who sing the main theme song but change the lyrics
*the lyrics are already in english*
Aldus (Jess): lmao
Aldus (Jess): y u do this
Aldus (Jess): endless struggle already has enough emotion without lyrics? like it doesnt even need then tbh
Aldus (Jess): as long as you have the context
Nokri (Marisa): yee, and even just hearing you can find of tell it's not the happiest of songs
Aldus (Jess): oh yea def 10/10
Nokri (Marisa): time to dump baby powder on this wig and see if it survives
Aldus (Jess): WHOOO!
Nokri (Marisa): wig looks much better. i think. yehaw.
hopefully the clay will be dry enough by morning to glue.
i wanna do a makeup test but it's past midnight and i already showered so perhaps in the morning.
Aldus (Jess): Who you working on?
Nokri (Marisa): mari! ~~I could just use my real hair but <:lenny:395307171539189760>~~
Nokri (Marisa): this but i left her school uniform in the US so i'm doing a swimsuit version
Nokri (Marisa): i couldn't find any foam but i found lightweight clay that's like model magic for the white headband pieces
Aldus (Jess): Oh yea! You said that! Does the baby power make it lighter?
Nokri (Marisa): a little bit, it actually made it a little purple until i batted the wig enough times. it was mostly to reduce the shine because i bought the cheapest $5 wig from amazon (it was a curly wig that i ironed straight)
Nokri (Marisa): the pigtails are probably a little too thick but yolo
Aldus (Jess): oooo neat!
Nokri (Marisa): my tub is covered in powder. but i'm making an authoritative decision. to deal with it later. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): it should wash down the drain but yea deal with that later
Nokri (Marisa): it's a *lot* of powder. a fine dusting.
Nokri (Marisa): it'll make it smell better.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah.
Aldus (Jess): put back in jar and use again lol
Nokri (Marisa): resale value doubles
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): When a TV show has a crossover episode
