Bill: not that it's not "fireworks director".
Aldus (Jess): I love this call cuz ray is basically like "do you like bitter things, wait no one likes bitter things... Do you not mind bitter things by any chance?" And then you can answer with "I love bitter things, I drink my coffee black!" And he's like "oh great! ~~i totally don't have to make the brainwash liquid taste better for you~~"
Nokri (Marisa): "hey i have this drink you're gonna lOVE"
