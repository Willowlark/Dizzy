秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): OH NO I'm sorry I hope that wasn't a time sensitive thing. my phone's been haywire all day, the battery's been jumping from 70% to 25% to 1% to 9% and only giving me notifications that are days old

the big paragraph is a lot of warnings, like if you drink it you need to go to the hospital ASAP, the obsidian used in the making of the product is a type of glass that *will* cut you if it breaks, this product introduces one of many unique histories? something like that.
it's handmade so please understand that every single product will be different, etc etc
