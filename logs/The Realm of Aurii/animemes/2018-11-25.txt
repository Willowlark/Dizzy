Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And was it a... Like flash mob set up or did that many people just know the song ðŸ˜±
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): it was in japan at a cosplay event
they had a stage and a big dance area set up with music played by DJs. you could get on stage and dance freely if you knew the upcoming song but it was so well-coordinated it seemed staged at first. and if you didn't want to go up on the stage you could dance on the floor area, and then on the sides and in back people were standing or sitting.
this song got just about everyone dancing, especially people who were sitting and chilling like us.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): this, precure, and hypnosis mic were super popular dance songs
