this author loves height differences :3c
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Height differences are cute yo
Bill: I’m glad you think so.
Aldus Larian (Jess): They are cute!
N🆗ri (Marisa): they cute but there's a big difference between "same age height difference!" and "this girl is 12 and the guy is 20" in anime height differences <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): O H
Aldus Larian (Jess): O H
N🆗ri (Marisa): there was a manga last week i can't recall the name of <:thinku:543194478614413318> the girl was cursed to have the appearance of a child because she promised a god she would marry him at that age. the god has the choice to make her appearance like 7 or 17 at will and mostly keeps her smol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Manga was a mistake
N🆗ri (Marisa): found it! kami-sama x ore-sama x danna-sama
of course the only way to get her to change appearance is to kiss her
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😶
Bill: Oh if you like height differences hiyokoi is lit a romance about that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oye i saw that anime
height difference is just really popular with this author. as is historical settings and girls with secretly big chests. weird themes.
