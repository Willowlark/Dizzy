Bill: *“I’m only yelling at you because I believe in you!”*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom doesn't get angry when he give people talks so they actually work cuz being being angry at me doesn't help
Bill: I’m. Being sarcastic. I only yell at Marisa cause she refuses to listen to me when I try and say things nicely.
