ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): ðŸ˜±
Nokri (Marisa): who was talking about sarazanmai at animenext applebees
i finally started it
it's really freaky to watch because it's the exact neighborhood i lived in and i'm very familiar with all the places in the first episode. i can pinpoint my old apartment's location in the opening theme song.
Nokri (Marisa): props to the animators for getting the little inconsequential details tho like the bus stop next to the station
Nokri (Marisa): i think the show weirds me out because i still know people who live there and i know people who work in the shops there and it's really bizarre seeing it all animated so realistically
minus the stuff related to the anime's plot because. that is not realistic.
Nokri (Marisa): i hope they show a certain building so i can screenshot it and send it to people i had classes with in that building
