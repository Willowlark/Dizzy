Aldus Larian (Jess): OOF
Bill: oh god
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): can u read it
Aldus Larian (Jess): with much effort yes
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): it's got the old fashioned thing going where the S's look like F's

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): living as an emperor's.... pance?
Aldus Larian (Jess): fiance
Aldus Larian (Jess): no, its a terrible fint
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooooooh
Aldus Larian (Jess): the purpose of a font is to be read, if it can serve that purpose with at least minimal effort, it a bad font
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also <@!301927856240459777> please close some tabs holy shit

Bill: Did you see the jessies do Yona and Hak at AB?
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): jess? :0

Bill: Gotta do that at some point.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i already wore yona at animenext and otakon but i somewhat want to do her again
Bill: GOOD
Bill: Thatâ€™s the secret Mawisa. Rewearing a cosplay means you love them even MORE
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): but i did rewear yona
Bill: It scales. You could love her 3x more.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): are you challenging how much i like yona
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>

who went to the live action play and pre-ordered the fanbook and has multiples of everything so i can keep one in mint condition always
Bill: Sup Konachan.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): the other group that asks me to room with them is my yona group maybe i'll just have to return to them
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): to show my love for yona
Bill: You mean Courtney and them?
Bill: Or Jess Tom and Georgia who wanna be your Yona group.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i mostly need more yona cosplay pictures. i only have a few that are decent and they're all visually very similar. my otakon shoot got messed up so i have few pictures of me in it ~~but i have beautiful pictures of other cosplayers aaaa~~
Bill: And Andrew.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): courtney and co., and amy's group also
Bill: Dunno Amy. Iâ€™ll shoot it if you do wear it again.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): would you? :0
Bill: *I'm fully aware of how much you love it, of COURSE I would*
Bill: I'll have no ideas for poses though.
Bill: Not that I'll need them, cause you memorized every page of the manga.

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Red Bob hair with lightning tiger screams yona
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): naw, yona was so popular it spawned a few copycat series
that one is about a girl with red hair who gets a pet tiger that's a little kitten but it can teleport and also shift between being a big scary tiger (with the girl's magic) or a hot guy
they get thrown in jail and i think the tiger has a magic clone too
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): OH i think i found it
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah!! there's only a couple of chapters in english online though so they don't have the part where her hair is shorter

NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): that's contoured
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): one of these that goes all the way around and matches my skintone
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Could yeah
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): swole zeno
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Could just have the sides open but the top would need to be more secured ofc
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Might just be easier with the tight shirt
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): ye i feel like i'd keep taping it and gluing it throughout the day if it was just open
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): oh wow it'll be a while before rwby season 7 is released, they just started recording today rip
