Bill: Is that what Elfie does?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YES
Bill: (moving)

I guess BNHA has a lot of fan interpretation... Anything I ship Bakugo and Uraraka for (don't hate me Erik) is fanon.
Bill: Fantastic fanon, and I can see how the story could go that way if the author learned what girls are, but fanon.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Honestly most ships in BNHA are fanon
Aldus Larian (Jess): ☝
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pretty much everything aside from Ochako/Deku is right?
Bill: everything except like... Oc-- yeah that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaaaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): Or deku/Maria but she’s out of the picture now
Bill: And I don't consider that valid cause it's bullshit, he just made her character into a fanboy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): like there are reasons for lots of other ships but nothing canony? i dont think?
Bill: yeah. There's a relationship dynamic, which is for their friendship in canon, that people will take to romantic levels.
Bill: Like, when friends go for awhile and see where it goes.
Bill: Bakugo and Uraraka, *every* single fic, from different authors, uses the fact that Bakugo respected her enough to not pull punches at the sports festival, despite her friends saying 'she's just a girl' as the basis.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): has she grown as a character yet?
Bill: GOD no.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...rip
Bill: The female cast got shafted.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ok then my hatred for her is still valid
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ..ok hate is a strong word
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my dislike of her
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think it's because it got so popular. horikoshi doesn't have time to sleep let alone plan out character development anymore
Bill: She was one of the 4 arc stars in the Yakuza/hideout arc and she did NOTHING while Deku, Kiri and... I forgot who else ran with the big three.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): didn't she go off with the other female who basically did nothing?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes only there to be dekus love interest and cheerleader and i will not like her until she becomes her own person
Bill: No I get you Leanna. her canon personality is just a 'fuck me deku' doll and I hate that.
Bill: But shounen authors are rarely capable of portraying a female character without her being a cheerleader so.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she is cute though, i'll give her that. ~~aside from her dumb ass boots~~
Bill: Her hero outfit looks stupid but. A lot of the outfits are stupid.
Bill: So I run with it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Case in point: Kirishima
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its like specifically the vagina on her suit and her dumb boots
Bill: *Here's looking at you Momo*
Bill: *All of you*
Bill: *because your 15 and basically naked in public*
Bill: Tsuyu may have been the fourth one in that arc. they teamed with Nejire and did jack shit for the whole arc.
Bill: Which is sad.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :/
Bill: And Tsuyu is the most useful female no less.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bnha get your shit together pls
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is it any better in the manga?
Bill: Manga is... kinda worse? Less time. Iirc the anime is actually adding characterization cause they have more time than the author does.
Bill: Not significantly worse.
Bill: But just in a vacuum, anime comes off better.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah the anime is adding little details
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ok then i stand by "bnha get your shit together pls"
N🆗ri (Marisa): because the manga is so rushed they print chapters unfinished
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh geez
Bill: Just wait till the class A / class B fight. It's.... ugh.
Bill: But the new chapter starts a new arc and I like the idea of a Todoroki/Bakugo arc.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~ok.... like if bakugo gets more screentime i'll obviously watch, but i still think they need to fix the girls~~
Bill: They do.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mood
N🆗ri (Marisa): never forget
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): vs the finished versions
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Crazy
