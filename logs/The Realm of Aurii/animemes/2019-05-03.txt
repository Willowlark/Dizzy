Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh yee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Unless the artists were forced to make him that way by directors
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Then fuck em
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, I can understand wanting to bring a little realism to the design rather than it be taken directly from the games and adding textures to it, but when the character is already very bizarre looking to begin with, trying to make it more real makes it look worse. I think they went too far trying to make him look "believable"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like this fan edit is just adding texture to the video game character
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but this one I think looks okay, giving him more of the classic Sonic shape, but still keeping some bits of the original design
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It <@!351785752197201920> and <@!351471675843411978>

Bill: Whose genius idea was it to dub that, like 10 years after it aired?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Sentai always be dubbing stuff late, theyâ€™re smaller so it helps them get big titles that fell through the dub cracks
