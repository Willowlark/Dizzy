N🆗ri (Marisa): what happaned at the harry potter festival? :0
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wtf is happening in that art
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I got stopped by someone from the Save the Children foundation who kind of pressured me on the spot to sign up for a monthly donation
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo that saeran art is really good. I think cheritz donates to a few different charities
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh yeah they do. I just saw the one I donate to too lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~haha neither of them would pass up the chance to die~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's sad that person did that to you tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I think it was because by signing up through her, she got like, credit for it or something
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because I asked if I could just donate online at home and she was like "No, you'd have to do it through me" and then when I went to make an account so I could reduce my monthly donation I saw plenty of options for signing up for a monthly donation or even just a one-time donation
N🆗ri (Marisa): why people gotta be like that
how do they even be like that i can't fathom how someone thinks acting like that is ok

Aldus Larian (Jess): its not about him, ray is just where MC is and is assigned to take care of her
Aldus Larian (Jess): the premise of another story is that you are testing a game
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Question regarding gameplay: If you save when the story branches, get one ending, then go back to the save point and choose a different branch?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont actually know cuz i never save XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just let the game save itself
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think so though?
