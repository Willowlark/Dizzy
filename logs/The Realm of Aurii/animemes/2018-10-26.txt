Total Nok-out (Marisa): and V's like "hey you've been playing a game recently. here's your username. also you've lost a bunch of matches in a row and you're frustrated" and yoosung is like WOAH YEAH you are a good detective, who keeps beating me?
and then V is like 'the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime' and seven comes back on
and yoosung gets mad at seven and demands a rematch and logs off, seven gets confused and complains about connection problems and logs off, then V is like "or maybe the greatest detective is also the villain" winky face
