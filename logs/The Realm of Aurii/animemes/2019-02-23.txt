Dirty Lego (Tom): 
Dirty Lego (Tom): A still from the movie :
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): they touch
Bill: HUH
Bill: So that slow burn Uraraka/Bakugo fic was called two black dots.
Bill: This is why.
Bill: I *never* would have noticed that.
Bill: 
Bill: tumblr people, whats the deal with Zines?
Dirty Lego (Tom): cute
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): they fun and for charity
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): cute
Bill: But. what are they.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): basically american doujin
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): artbooks and fanfic in a mini magazine made by fans

Dirty Lego (Tom): those are some neet murderducks
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Zines are collections of fanart and sometimes fanfic too they ussually have a theme like a certain character or ship. A bunch of writters and artists ussually get together to do them and then you can order them and all the proceeds go to charity, at least from what I've seen. Sometimes you'll get extras with the zine love buttons or postcards or keychains
Bill: OOooh, so they aren't published online really?
Bill: That might explain why I only see them talked about, rather than the content.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sometime, but not publicly. Like you might pay $15 for the PDF version of the zine and $25 for the print version
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Or an artist or writtwr will post their contribution tot be zine if they so choose, ussually a little whole after the zine has been released or they will post a preview of the art or writting
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But yes the whole point of to pay for access to it so the proceeds can go to charity.
Bill: Yeah, that makes sense why I never see it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Since it's a fic they may have posted it on thier fanfic.net or ao3 account (or whatever they use)
Bill: Yeah, I was thinking of jumping from the writer to the zine.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Unless they published it completely on thier own there will probably only be like a one shot in there from them
Bill: when
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuuuteee
Bill: Do that during boudoir, probably the next time you'll have Tom in Ren. And also. That'd be extra adorable.
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
