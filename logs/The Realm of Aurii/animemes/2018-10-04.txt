Nokri (Marisa): a high school girl who looks and dresses like a guy goes into a host club and breaks stuff and racks up a huge debt, and the top princely host mistakes her for a guy and forces her to join his club. but here it's a survival game club

Nokri (Marisa): anime characters include the third teammate who's a reclusive hentai manga artist, a sadistic doctor, and the girl and guy who are the doctor's co-workers who also love him
Nokri (Marisa): in this essay i will discuss the cinematic parallels between tamaki and masaoka as they have homosexual panics over falling in love with their clubmate who they think is a guy but is really a girl

Elfriede (Tom): Wait they changed the characters in the anime? Nano
Nokri (Marisa): naw naw the twins just didn't come along until later in the story. the anime is only 12 episodes
Nokri (Marisa): i'm trying to find a pic of the twins together but it's hard because reasons
Nokri (Marisa): wow what a great family
Aldus (Jess): looks gey
Nokri (Marisa): ya the one twin (younger i think?) is better at everything and the older one is a crybaby, but the younger brother has a stalkery brother complex and also is a yandere so the older brother likes to avoid him
Nokri (Marisa): but also older brother is relatable
Nokri (Marisa): older brother is probably the most sane person in the series tbh
Aldus (Jess): y he stab him eye?
