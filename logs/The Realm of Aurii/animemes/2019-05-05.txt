Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oo I'm really excited about how the water color paint looks the yellow on the tip blended nice
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also wooooo!! Gotta get hype for the movieee
Aldus Larian (Jess): Him climb
N🆗ri (Marisa): lelouch vs the stairmaster 3000
Aldus Larian (Jess): Stairmaster would win
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Viletta saying "Ha simple minded eleven" then marrying Ougi
Elfriede Faun (Tom): LMAO TRUE
N🆗ri (Marisa): 11 on the streets but 1 in her heart
Elfriede Faun (Tom): My least favorite plot point in all of code Geass is his eye accidentally going off and making Euphie go crazy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Spoilers babe God
Bill: Yeeee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Not that I wasn't a good idea it just seemed cheesy how he was like
Bill: That always felt dumb.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wouldn't it be funny if I told you to kill everyon WOOOOPS
N🆗ri (Marisa): Euphemia’s downfall was great
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah! It was great! Just the conversation ahhhhhh
N🆗ri (Marisa): “No geno- oh whoops there she goes”
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ARTHUR TOOK THE ZERO MASK
Elfriede Faun (Tom): CLEARLY THE BEST SCENE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So <@301927856240459777>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Important question
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Are you team Tadase or team Ikuto
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ikuto and Amu is the canon pairing despite the freaky age difference 
Gotta go with what’s canon. Though if I remember correctly Tadase and Amu went on a date because he only liked her as Amulet Heart
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah it's true they are canon
Elfriede Faun (Tom): .but.. what team we're you while watching <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Or reading*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also basically chat and ladybug right?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): https://tenor.com/zt0C.gif
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hmmmm it’s been 10 years since I’ve seen it. Ppppprooooobablyyyy tadase? Until ikuto became the clear canon love candidate. I usually support whatever is canon

They pretty different from chat and ladybug <:thinku:543194478614413318> chat is super obvious with his flirting and ladybug is like “lol nah I like someone else”
Amu and Ikuto are a more tsundere couple
N🆗ri (Marisa): OwO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): https://tenor.com/56ee.gif
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Rip Ikuto
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Saddest anime death
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooo see there isn’t Ikuto though right? That’s Yoru or whatshisname possessing him?
That second one is totally Ikuto rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): Are y’all watching Shugo Chara?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Midnight ship wars
Elfriede Faun (Tom): No it just popped into my head that you'd prob have supported prince boi
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I have no idea why
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Asides from the canon ending
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The thing with the merry go round I think
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think that was the Ikutamu ending 🤔
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I remember I never actually finished season 3
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg fake fan
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I got a few episodes in and skipped to the end oops
N🆗ri (Marisa): Gotta find a harem anime with no canon partner to get true unbiased research data
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I watched 1 and 2 tho!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yo shuffle bamboozled me
N🆗ri (Marisa): Two has good theme songs
Shugo Chara in general has good theme songs
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I never thought that the green hair girl would be the canon
N🆗ri (Marisa): Shuffle shuffles heads
Surprise!!!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): HOP SKIP JUMPU
N🆗ri (Marisa): DREW DRAW DRAWN
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ITS PLAYING IT MY HEAD WOOO

N🆗ri (Marisa): Chip syrup whip
N🆗ri (Marisa): Haippu
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Does yosuga no Sora have a Canon girl?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sora would be the canon
Elfriede Faun (Tom): How unfortunate
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think she gets pregunte in the game. Maybe the anime too I don’t think I saw it all
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Understandable
Elfriede Faun (Tom): She didn't get pregnant no
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They just got caught by the friend having diddles o.n The floor and the whole town shunned them for incest
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And they moved away
N🆗ri (Marisa): Even kodomo no jikan has a canon girl and they’re all in elementary school rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): Understandable
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AHHHH
