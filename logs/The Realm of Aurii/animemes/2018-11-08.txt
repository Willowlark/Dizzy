Bill: AAAAH NOOOO
Bill: Rwby/BNHA cross over quest: Izuku and Pyrrha are partners.
Bill: So are *Ruby and Bakugo*.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üòï
Bill: Randomly generated, not directed.
Bill: But That's so terrible!
Bill: why!
Bill: Having Izuku unable to 'manifest aura' as his quirkless equivalent doesn't quite click with RWBY lore...
Bill: *If only he would. stop. chopping.*
Bill: 
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): chop chop chop chop till you drop
One hop this time (Tom): **canyounotsinghighschoolmusical**
Bill: Also Bakugo, given he will attract grimm like pot heads to a music festival with his eternal bad mood, should clearly have died as a kid.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i've never seen high school musical ever but i know every single word to everything in it
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): sitting backstage for 6 months of a theater production of it yehaw
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): high school musical cosplay
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): high school musical themed masquerade ideas
Bill: Blake and Tenya.
Bill: That's...
Bill: Oh, poor Blake.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's because his name has nya in it isn't it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's alot of books
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): mystic messenger skit with We're All in This Together
Bill: According to the GM teams were assigned randomly, bar Izuku and Pyrrha which the collaborative player chose.
Bill: (Weiss would have been more fun, but *fine*, Pyrrha)
Bill: OOF
Bill: Weiss and *Nora*.
Bill: He threatened breaking up Renora, but it's still sin.
Bill: If they aren't on the same team...
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): they're from the same series why pair them up
Bill: Random.
Bill: Shouto and Ren LOL
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): quiet duo
Bill: Imagine the sheer amount of silence between them.
Bill: Yang and Asui.
Bill: The latter is tongue whipping Yang for puns.
Bill: Players chose Weiss and Nora to go with Pyrrha and Izuku.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Todoroki and Ren?!?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~and me?~~
Bill: Oh god I just realized that's probably a sex dream of yours.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lmfao
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): This fan fictl sounds cracky af
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also Nora and Weiss wtfff
Bill: it's like the Mawisa quest, it's being played by 20 people on the forum.
Bill: Pairings were random.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH I thought it was a fan fic
Bill: I'm reading it like such.
Bill: I checked; most recent story post was yesterday. So if I catch up I can join the voting.
Bill: The GMing and writing are good, even if the story line is literally just RWBY but...
Bill: if I make it to the end maybe I'll play.
Bill: Tenya leadings Blake, Yang, and Asui.
Bill: I.
Bill: Guess?
Bill: Eh I dunno if I like Midoriya as leader.
Bill: Ruby leading Bakugo, Ren, Todoroki.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOF
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Poor ruby
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My name's Ruby and these are my son's, there's the angry one, the one with anger problems, the quiet one with Daddy isses, and the quiet one with no daddy!
Bill: OOOOF
Bill: I love it though.
Bill: Dunno how she‚Äôll reign in Bakugo but I know she will.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I serious cannot do crossovers
Bill: ~~is the BNHA part where I‚Äôm true anime fashion everyone freezes up with the idea of coed rooms?~~
Bill: * in
Bill: Well.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Even canon crossovers are on thin ice
Bill: Izuku Weiss and Pyrrha. Nora‚Äôs like fuck it me and Ren did it all the time.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~nora like I'm not even gonna be in dis room most of time~~ <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I don‚Äôt think anyone cares past high school irl, the overnight our manga club did had a huge co-ed sleeping room
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEET
Bill: We do it all the time for cons.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): We are beacons of sin
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~both Ruby and Izuku are in nosebleed city?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Orrrrr?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh look both man characters are in rooms full of members of the opposite sex. What in harem hell?
Bill: Ruby is generally considered pretty much asexual so...
Bill: I dunno if it‚Äôll be the same reaction.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I know I'm just messing anyway lol
Bill: ~~But what reaction it would be~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I also see Ruby as asexual
Bill: That‚Äôs an otome game in the making.
Bill: Well. Canon Ruby just isn‚Äôt getting any writing for that part of personality. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs definitive proof, but I‚Äôd believe it if it were to be true.
Bill: But until RT can write subplots for romance...
Bill: The fanon shall represent canon.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Ryan/Edgar is the true OTP rooster teeth doesn‚Äôt need anything more
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Just a Minecraft man and the cow he trapped in a hole in his house.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lmfao
Bill: Bakugo: *strips off sweaty shirt*
Ruby: ***OwO***
Bakugo: ‚Äúfuck You looking at runt? I do what I want cause I‚Äôm the fucking best, I‚Äôll strip where I want!‚Äù
Bakugo: *tears off pants* 
Bakugo: *toned muscles glisten*
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): If he‚Äôs glistening does that mean he might accidentally explode in his sleep
Bill: Bakugo walks around in his underwear to ‚Äúspite‚Äù Ruby and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwell I won‚Äôt correct him‚Äù.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): She just doesn‚Äôt want any more stinky fuel covered clothes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The other two bois are like üòêü§®
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ~~todoroki considers lighting him up~~
Bill: Ren might be considerate and like, change in the bathroom.
Bill: I dunno bout Todoroki.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): PROBABLY
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Todoroki just faces the wall
Bill: ~~Tamaki is that you?~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Todoroki makes a privacy igloo
Bill: Todoroki would probably be like 'this is just training to get used to being in close quarters out in the wilderness hunting grimm' which was Deku's argument.
Bill: ~~Todoroki is more worried about modesty than Ruby somehow~~
Bill: PLEASE make Nora judging people on a scale of '1 to Ren' canon
Bill: "I only rated you an 8.5 out of Ren..."
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's amazing and I love it
Bill: *snrk*
Bill: Apparently Pyrrha goes for a morning jog in her stupid heels.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): UGH that's terrible
Bill: No wonder Izuku lapped her.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Pyrrha must have prosthetic legs by now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Actually
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~she has no leggies~~
~~cuz she ded~~
Bill: > Izuku calls home
> Mom Izuku: "So tell me all about your team"
> Option 1: They're nice!
> Option 2: They're nice and all girls!
Bill: *Oh riiiight, Tenya is with three girls too.
Bill: 
Bill: poor yang.
Bill: she's got nothing.
Bill: No puns.
Bill: No blushing boys.
Bill: ~~No wait she pounced on Izuku, let the chaos commence~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Who are you?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Oo Oo. Oo Oo.
Bill: Izuku is the MC, but it's third person.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But it says "you look at your own team..."
Bill: oh.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "you all start to walk over there"
Bill: Clearly i'm playing attention.
Bill: They had him tell his Mom
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): So you‚Äôre deku?
Bill: mhmm.
Bill: Nora threw Izuku to the ~~wolves~~ Yang.
Bill: Yang: "So Izuku, see anything *interesting* last night?"
Izuku: *Deep breaths, show no weakne-
Nora: "Well, we saw more of him that he saw of us last night."
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: oof I'm getting harem vibes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nope nope nope nope
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Backpedal
Bill: it's subtle.
Bill: and the point of the scene was harassing Deku for his abs.
Bill: But.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ‚ÄúLol this nerd has abs what a nerd‚Äù
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Surprised bakugo hasn‚Äôt canonically challenges him to a flexing contest
Bill: new hope, Yang challenges Bakugo to one.
Bill: and wins.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WAIT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ren could just fucking yeet Bakugo into being calm
Bill: OH SHIT
Bill: THE WOMBO COMBO
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Jess solved everything
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): That‚Äôs it that‚Äôs the end
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'll take my payment in form of dark chocolates thanks
Bill: alright I'll pick up more on the train tomorrow mornin.
Bill: Cause I can smell the burn out coming due to how close this is to canon.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Rwby canon?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The idea of calm bakugo is messing me up
Bill: RWBY canon.
Bill: They just did the port boarbatusk fight pretty much verbatim, but it‚Äôs Izuku not Weiss, Weiss is salty about not being leader in the exact same way...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ü§î
Bill: Such is the nature of a crossover, and more importantly the quest format.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): isekai idea: a girl gets teleported to another world and gets a harem of guys (mostly) also from other worlds because they miss what was considered to be socially acceptable in their original world and find the new world's concept of love and marriage to be daunting
Bill: Are you sure that's not already an isekai?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it'll balance out all the existing "guy goes to other world. gets immediate harem."
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): is it???
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): give to me pls
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OwO im here for it
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): a while ago i was reading a psuedo isekai where the girl moved to a world where everything was exactly the same except guys and girls' were reversed. like, guys were submissive and meek while girls talked about porn and did raunchy things.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): cuz of course that's what guys and girls are like
Bill: I'm always pretty interested in otome/reverse harem stuff. It's usually better quality because women like personalities and not just boob physics.
Bill: except that one.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): have you read kuro no iyashi
and there's another one i've been reading recently about a saint that's really similar but that's super josei/otome themed
Bill: Nah, haven't read either.
Bill: I gotta catch up on Takagi/Horiymiya tho.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~dick physics when~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): seijo no maryoku wa bannou desu. that's it.
horimiya it's been so looong. takagi has good theme songs
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): jess no
Bill: Never happen.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): marisa, make your idea into a manga and let me have 2 pages for dick psychics?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just 2 page we can do it in a mocking boob physics way
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i will give you 3 pages for anything but that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üò≠
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): you can make a doujin
Bill: But like, it seriously can't happen. just cause of censorship laws and stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this is america
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): actually no you are right
Bill: I mean, even in japan.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NO wait is ok cuz if i did it in a mocking way.

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): fb eye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IT JUST A DICK üò≠
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): EXACTLY
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im here for equality ok
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): there's no equal sign react what does this mean for america
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): reading a horror manga
girl character repeatedly touches her stomach (which is emphasized every time), is moody and gets angry for no reason over the series while everyone else is rational.
characters are gonna be tortured forever unless they figure out how to get the souls of their parents to pass on. manga keeps talking about the cycle of life and passing on duties to the next generation.
characters can't figure out what to do at all until the girl whispers "Actually, I'm... [incoherent]" and saves them all.

top comments are all "wow i bet she was actually turned into a demon" reALLY NOW? *are you sure that's what she was saying*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LMFAO

Bill: Fun facts from tvtropes:

Aizawa x Tsuyu is very popular. 
Midoriya x Bakugo‚Äôs mom is a common crack ship.
Bill: Mineta is apparently smarter than Bakugo (Author‚Äôs pet much?)
Bakugou is top of both eastern and western popularity polls.
Bill: Sero has a lot of female fans in Japan?
Bill: I have seen multiple references, in discussing does Endeavor deserve his redemption arc, where the commenter is saying do not describe the argument because flame war will occur.
