"i dont have to work 20 hr shifts?"
"whats food?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): What was he in the dream seven had in one of the endings

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont think so <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that makes so much more sense now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i didnt get why seven was like "hey, you're searan right?" like yea bitch, you aint looking in a mirror
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a fancy mirror that brightens hair and suits to a lighter shade
