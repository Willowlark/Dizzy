Nokri (Marisa): sorted my magazines and books again
turns out i accidentally bought volume 18 of hero academia twice haha oops. does anyone want the spare? it's the latter half of the saving eri arc.
also it's gonna break my kokoro to recycle all these magazines eventually but at least i can clip out the good parts, and most came with freebies. ~~two issues of the same zero sum comic because one came with an Animate Exclusive™ postcard that i *needed*.~~
if anyone desperately wants a particular issue i can bring it or mail it back but otherwise they gonna be recycled
