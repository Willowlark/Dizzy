Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Jaehee fucking gets it
Erik: ~~whose route are you doing now?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): jaehee!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they had an MM themed cafe in Korea and had like cosplayers as the waiters
N🆗ri (Marisa): pack up guys we're moving to korea
closer to japan anyway
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think it might be over now?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea it was like jan/feb
N🆗ri (Marisa): no way to be sure unless we go
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i didnt realize they had the cosplayer waiters
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wait maybe this was different from the cafe? oh man im confuse
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i cant read korean
N🆗ri (Marisa): *learn girl. learn we're moving there right now.*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it ended yesterday 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): WE CAN STILL MAKE IT
N🆗ri (Marisa): MOVE MOVE MOVE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH they had one character a week
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~chertiz, come back to otakon, do this here~~
Bill: ~~Rika week, she makes you join the cult~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): there was totally a pre-game chat where she did that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): rip no rika week cuz they knew no one wanted it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean she tries to give away her "wine" and the rfa party
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): o wow the people who made a searan zine got featured on the chertiz website since they donated to unicef
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's awesome
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Other companies: "no non-canon art!"
Chertiz: "wow this is amazing"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): at otakon they signed anything and everything they had no rule against art
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's beautiful ;u;
yeah so many other companies are super against it
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~if cheritz goes to otakon again you already know we going ham together~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I GOTTA GET YOU YOUR SIGN BOARD AHHH
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH WE GOTTA GO TO OTAKON TOGETHER
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA WE GOIN FAM
~~i will legit wait on that autograph line all over again~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Looks like the made in abyss movie will be playing in theatres March 20th and 25th
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jaehees route? more like ship Zen and Jaehee route
Aldus Larian (Jess): then Jumin's all up in here like "dont talk to me or my assistant ever again"
N🆗ri (Marisa): Every time he says assistant he picks up another member of the RFA
N🆗ri (Marisa): Zens like “don’t touch me”
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao even zn ends up working for him in his route
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think the only person that doesn't get a job offer from jumin over all the routes is V
Bill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bILE5BEyhdo
Bill: I can't wait for this.
Erik: fuck now I definitely want to see it
Erik: fucking Mewtwo is in it
Bill: How far was it to our area from you again?
Erik: like 2 hours
Bill: oof. We do movies over by us, usually anime movies that are thursday night only premieres. Could add you to that chat but. Probably too far to do on a work night.
Erik: yeah :/
Bill: ~~how that thor labs app go~~
Erik: just like with every other app... unnoticed
Bill: oof.
Leanna: Oof I came back at the right moment
Leanna: Mood
Erik: like I either get no response, or I get a response months later saying they filled the position or I didn't meet their requirements
Bill: What your resume look like?
Bill: Knowing you you have a well put together one, but I've done up resumes for half a dozen people in LaTex just because it gets compliments on the look.
Bill: 
Erik: Probably could use a major revamp. I've been using the same formatting since like freshman year of college and just adding to and deducting from it
Erik: oh wow, we were always told to keep it to one page
Bill: I've heard many opinions on that. At least for tech, according to recruiters I've worked with, multiple pages is okay because they want to know everything you've done that could be relevant to the job they have in mimd.
Bill: That's why the bullets are so long, especially for Indellient. If they see something I've done in the past that could relate to the project they're hiring for, that's a reason to contact me.
Erik: ~*potential employer clicks github link*~
"Hmm, what's this *'aurii'* thing?"
Bill: ~~or more likely, a keyword they searched for~~
Bill: Technically possible.
Bill: Though Aurii is a self hosted webpage, so shows technical skills.
Erik: valid
N🆗ri (Marisa): Y’all have such fancy resumes
Bill: Post grad experience is more important than education.
N🆗ri (Marisa): At 2:30 I’m running out the door. I changed all the settings on the printer and made new applications for stuff they lost and then I’m gonna update my resume <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I don't know if it would be the same, but I feel like you could fluff some more keywords describing your work experience.
Erik: I honestly need to sit down and do a serious revamp of mine. I tried to condense my work experience to very general terms to the point where I don't even really remember what all I actually did
Erik: Which tripped me up in my last interview when he asked about my previous work history
Bill: Yeah, that feels like the mistake. Many of my interviews asked about my prior project work.
Erik: ~~even though he still offered me the job~~
Bill: ~~Ironically I can't remember any of my interview for indellient~~
Bill: Just other interviews.
Bill: The only thing I remember is greeting Gord and him asking what I go by (William, Bill, Billy, etc). I said 'you can call me anything you want except late for dinner.'
Bill: He got that reference (I never knew the source, just the phrase) and lol'd and from that point on it's blur.
Erik: and that's when he hired you on the spot
Bill: ~~I still joke that's exactly what he did~~
Bill: Our humor is pretty similar. We get along well that way.
Erik: I'd be too afraid to say anything like that lol
Erik: I go for the super polite, easy to get along with approach
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dont have a copy on me but it looks vastly different from your guys XD
Bill: Gords... very relaxed. But I also get my work done and keep in the loop of my status and issues. So he knows I'm on top of things, clients are happy, and that's his priority.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I know talk are talking about resumes and all
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And that's great
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But Mewtwo is in that movie
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So I gotta see it now too
Aldus Larian (Jess): XD
Bill: I'd like to say there's a good amount of trust between us. That said, he *is* still my boss so I occasionally hold my tongue.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG my coworker briefly saw my desktop and he was like "that looks like those things my daughter used to watch, the uhhhh, those japanesse animation things"
Bill: ~~then again this happened earlier~~
Erik: oh Bill your second work experience heading is at the bottom of the first page and the rest picks up at the beginning of the second and it's driving me nuts lol
Bill: Yeaaaah but LaTex is fucking ASS to work with.
Erik: but it looks like adding another space would drive it to a third page
Aldus Larian (Jess): he also thought it was a pic of santa?? cus theres like alot of white and red
Erik: wow I wish my boss and co-workers were that cool

Bill: To give you an idea, that's what LaTex looks like.
Erik: wow, that errored my brain
Bill: Adding just a newline is.... complicated.
Bill: Latex is programming language for word documents, basically.
Erik: I just format everything nicely in Word using tables and then hide the table outlines
Erik: so like when I'm editing it looks like this
Erik: and then I remove the table borders
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@351471675843411978>  is it santa?
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): its MM, what a surprise
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Santa mm
Aldus Larian (Jess): he only saw the left side
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): The hentais
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: I could probably format your via Latex, following the same structure as mine. It's been complimented by recruiters, HR, my college... so something about it works.
Bill: I dunno if it would be weird to ask our HR person? Japneet is nice and all but I have no idea how HR customs work because the first year and a half I was here HR (IE just her) was in Canada and Gord isn't really the HR type.
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): A goddess
