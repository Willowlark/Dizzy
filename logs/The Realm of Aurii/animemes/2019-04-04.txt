Aldus Larian (Jess): Deep route be like:
"Cats are the Best!"

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^^^
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hate when i gotta break harts! D:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the chats with 707 are easy to get his hearts but the chats with Jumin are challenging to *not* get *his* heart
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA!
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin just wants to give u his love 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg the april fools dlc is killing me XD

Bill: !lewd
N🆗ri (Marisa): ??????***???????***
Elfriede Faun (Tom): SHE HAS SAFETY SHORTS
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh her skirt is up high
o
classic anime
N🆗ri (Marisa): where's all the fruits basket art. it's been 10+ years gimme the art
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah lol remember when this fanart was everywhere
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's hard to find fanart but at least we get the full story animated this time around ;u;
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I literally called Jumin a bore and he gave me a heart -_-
Bill: The self love you have going is amazing.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumins self confidence is amazing
Aldus Larian (Jess): "MC calling me boring, oh how cute"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the responses for him are so hard to decide which will trigger a heart. Seven's are so easy because you just pick the one that says lolololol
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea jumins hard to figure out, seven just "which ever answer is the trolliest"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): jumin's are the more logical/realistic answers, or stuff that pays attention to him
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe that's a joke that didn't translate well?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the other option sounded too flirty lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I guess also kind of trolly
Aldus Larian (Jess): "jumin han is a bae rule"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no it was "Ju and L rule. Ju stand for Jumin, what does the L stand for?" or something like that
Aldus Larian (Jess): love i think?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which I'm guessing the L would be for Luciel
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or Love
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so either trolling or flirting
Aldus Larian (Jess): what are u on day 3? 4?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i can fucking do this dlc 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): Its so hard to not laugh
Aldus Larian (Jess): Someone help him
N🆗ri (Marisa): the april fools dlc is such a blessing
N🆗ri (Marisa): *yoosung is trying to help him*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm on Day 23
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***23***
Aldus Larian (Jess): erik got the true true ending
N🆗ri (Marisa): april fools good ending is so hard to get it took me like 3-4 tries
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah you guys didn't know about the super secret extended canon route?
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it extended because you're just trapped in a cage and V keeps delaying the party
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also Mawisa what were the not illegal ways of harvesting hearts/hourglasses?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo, farming with the christmas/april fools DLC
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's best on the christmas DLC at night
Aldus Larian (Jess): i looked up tips so hopefully i can get good end?
Aldus Larian (Jess): but you have to sepnd hourglasses to get the dlcs
Aldus Larian (Jess): zens route has lots tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): at like 8-9pm or so, keep starting over the christmas dlc and max speed through all the convos to get hourglasses. you can get like maybe 4 or 5 per restart
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes more
N🆗ri (Marisa): o ye! zen's route is good
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can also do the prologue
N🆗ri (Marisa): you sometimes get 2-3 hourglasses from the prologue, keep restarting it over and over and replaying it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): sweet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wonder if Gordon Ramsay knows he's in this game
Aldus Larian (Jess): Chef Ram G
Aldus Larian (Jess): best character
Aldus Larian (Jess): taking the photos for this dlc must have been so much fun XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): how many sevens did they make
how many yoosungs did they make
whose cat did they use
Aldus Larian (Jess): is that the kettle they use in the office? seven is def on someone bulletin board
Aldus Larian (Jess): if jumin is a cat, then is elizabeth a human?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah he talks about her a few times
Aldus Larian (Jess): YESSSS OMG
Aldus Larian (Jess): this dlc is amazing
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think she gets brought up in the really shady chat
Aldus Larian (Jess): shady??? 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah it’s SUPER suspicious and borderline illegal
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): iLleGal?!
N🆗ri (Marisa): y e a h
Aldus Larian (Jess): does that mean its flirty or like someone gonna die cuz with you it could be either
N🆗ri (Marisa): You gotta read it. You’ll know the chat.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nop neither of those
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~is unknown involved? asking for a friend.~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Naw sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): i synonymize him and "shady" so that was my first guess
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a chat this afternoon
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoo!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mailman: "are u famous? your mailbox is like overflowing with letters?"
Zen: "hmm no not really"
N🆗ri (Marisa): the mailman also starts leaving him letters

N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s it that’s exactly my thought process thank you Zen
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaoo

Bill: Marisa seems to think the body horror sexual abuse webcomic is good, I dunno if her opinion is valid... <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:rated_lewd:391242351198339093>
Bill: *hot*
Aldus Larian (Jess): now hes talking about how hes "better cardboard" because he has "history"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA OMG THAT CALL IS SO SAD
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~omg now there are options to talk about scratching with jumin too~~
Bill: Hair color checks out.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant believe V has a cosplay account
Bill: It's one picture of him in an ilfitting white wig with a leather jacket and looking confused.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: "People will love me if I dress like this...?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): THIS CHAT IS SO LEWD
Bill: good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nah, the illegal chat is much worse. The contents set off many alarms.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no D:

Aldus Larian (Jess): I was not expected the april fools dlc to have so many inuendos
N🆗ri (Marisa): No cardboard is legal
Aldus Larian (Jess): CAT NIP
Aldus Larian (Jess): JUMINS GON GET HIGH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): **Jumin Logic:**
"It's important to eat proper meals."
"It's the easiest thing to purchase with money."
"If you don't have enough money you can just cook ~~the food you have that costs money~~"
"Or you can hire a nutritionist and chef ~~which also costs money~~"
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pew:543202259085950996>
