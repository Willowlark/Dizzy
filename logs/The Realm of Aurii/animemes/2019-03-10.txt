Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg I was right
N🆗ri (Marisa): YOU WERE RIGHT
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🍰
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> also v is a stalker
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s why rika left him
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wait wasn't I supposed to get hourglasses? Or is that only if I actually play
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah you should get 40
N🆗ri (Marisa): Go to the main screen where you see the emails and chats and texts
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm not in a play through tho <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Guess you just need to start a new one then <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoowee I guess so. I could do the Valentine's dlc or the Christmas or April fool's
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t know if valentines would give you the bonus but Christmas def would
N🆗ri (Marisa): And April fools
Aldus Larian (Jess): Each character has a route for each one? Is that how it works
N🆗ri (Marisa): Don’t start them now though the April fools one would already be over around this time
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I'll wait till midnight since my sleep schedule bis fucked up anyway
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!
Except for April fools, there’s only three endings for that
And valentines isn’t a route it’s more a big visual novel with some choices
N🆗ri (Marisa): Due to daylight savings?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooooo but each character has an ending right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg I wonder if daylight savings messed up anyone’s chatrooms
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea kinda I slept till like 11:30
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nah in April fools there’s only three endings. Sane, insane, and kind of neutral I guess
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh shit that's a good question
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is your route ok
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not playing atm
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone sobbing in the morning that they missed a chatroom
N🆗ri (Marisa): U wot m8
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm never on a route when the birthday things happen 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wonder if we'll get 80 hourglasses for the twins bday
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s the best idea anyone’s ever had ever
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pls
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean it's 2 people's b-day so we should
N🆗ri (Marisa): Another 40 hourglasses for each of Saeran’s personalities and personas pls
Aldus Larian (Jess): 40 hours glasses for each outfit either of them has worn <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OwO didn't know this was a thing!
