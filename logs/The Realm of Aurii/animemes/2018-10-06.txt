Nokri (Marisa): Thatâ€™s my house
Elfriede (Tom): Mmm so like. The new Broly movie actually looks good and I wanna see it.
Elfriede (Tom): I haven't wanted to watch dbz in a long time
Nokri (Marisa): Your natural anime instincts are kicking back in
Nokri (Marisa): tfw a character says "that was the last time i ever saw [other character]"
and people in the comments are always saying "so when are [character] and [other character] gonna see each other again? the reunion is soon, right?"
children. the characters ain't never gonna see each other again.
Aldus (Jess): WHEN THEY SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN ?!?!!?
Nokri (Marisa): **never**
Nokri (Marisa): is anyone caught up on noragami. we gotta talk about it.
Nokri (Marisa): this is vaguely horrifying
Elfriede (Tom): Just vaguely ðŸ˜±

Elfriede (Tom): MY FAVORITE LANGUAGE
Elfriede (Tom): DONT YOU JUST LOVE WHEN YOujajkfgnnnerangjnrelnaerjga\

Aldus (Jess): That's def English
Aldus (Jess): Ggfvhg hfhbg hgyh?!
Aldus (Jess): I am not caught up on noragami ðŸ˜­
Aldus (Jess): And wow why do they wanna horrify jumin for his birthday
Elfriede (Tom): does ....
Elfriede (Tom): does Yoosung have a money launcher
Aldus (Jess): LMAO
Aldus (Jess): Yes
Nokri (Marisa): wow i can't believe yoosung is rich now
Nokri (Marisa): bye jumin
Aldus (Jess): They distracted jumin with the commoner food and stole all his money
Nokri (Marisa): it's like the episode of ouran where they go to a shopping mall
Nokri (Marisa): tamaki gets lost and they have to call him like a lost child over the intercom
Aldus (Jess): Of they did that for jumin like 900 woman would show up at the the service desk waiting for him
Aldus (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  y they has a generator in front of them? ~~i understand why they are by the trasj~~
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH! About that!!! It's because
Nokri (Marisa): i have absolutely no idea why there's a generator on the ground in front of them
Nokri (Marisa): according to google it's a car motor
Aldus (Jess): It's def a generator
Aldus (Jess): They eat popsicle
Nokri (Marisa): it also costs $2100
Nokri (Marisa): o u right it is a generator. why it on a car website
Aldus (Jess): Go back and steal me this
Aldus (Jess): Himself gonna melt himss ice
Nokri (Marisa): that majestic cutout was across from a wall with a lazer beam on it where you could pretend to be aoyama shooting lazers from your bellybutton
Aldus (Jess): WHAT omgggg did do it?! Are there pics
Nokri (Marisa): maybe there's something to do with a generator in the beginning of season 3 during the camp arc? but i don't remember anything at all
no i didn't <:rip:369476083248267274> there wasn't anyone around to take my picture
there was a SUPER nice staff member who took my pic for the iida thing. she was so sweet
Aldus (Jess): Yaaay!
Nokri (Marisa): she mentioned something about no pictures so i put my phone away and she saw me do that and came over and was like "movie!! no movie!! [in english] but pictures are ok! [in japanese]" and I was like OH ok thanks!
and then later she saw me slinking around and came back up and was like "hey want me to take your picture? follow me!" and i was like "OH BOY I LOVE YOU"
Nokri (Marisa): platonically
Aldus (Jess): Awwww! That's awesome!
Nokri (Marisa): now we'll never know why there's a generator
Nokri (Marisa): https://twitter.com/BBdosYaoi/status/1048317661153779712
Aldus (Jess): If the trash cans are there for popsicles where is deku gonna put his? <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> why was he invited to the popsicle party??
Aldus (Jess): HOLY SHIT THATS ADORABLE
Aldus (Jess): cosplay is the only reason to have children
Nokri (Marisa): i think they're oil drums. public trash cans don't really exist in japan except outside of convenience stores and those are like. weird giant crates with 5 different trash options
Nokri (Marisa): u gotta have your burnable paper, your burnable plastics, your non-burnable, your plastic bottles, and your... glass bottles i guess? i never really paid attention
Aldus (Jess): Ohhhh ok, why they eat popsicles near oil drums?!
Aldus (Jess): Theyre in the bad part of town now
Aldus (Jess): Someone save them
Nokri (Marisa): *they need a hero*
