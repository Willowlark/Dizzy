Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i found manga that's got the worst pacing ever
chapter one: typical "i'm going to magical school! oh no, i've been attacked by orc en route to magic school! wow, i'm really strong and beat them all!"
chapter two: "so i went to magical school and made lots of friends but i was too strong so they kicked me out and i became a wanderer and changed my name and now i'm in a new country and, hey! who's that hot noble guy over there?"
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): there was a sudden 2 year time skip after the first chapter for absolutely no reason, and it was glossed over in about 3 pages
Bill: Thatâ€™s one heck of a pacing owls
Bill: Spyro is one of the top loops in the infinite loops.
Bill: Coincidence?
Bill: Dear and fluffy lord, the mlp loops are 2.2 million words long.
Bill: Rwby clocks in at...
Bill: *Oh* 2.1 god bless the rwby fandom.
Bill: Jurassic park also is in the 29+ chapter category.
Bill: Marisa do you know where the goblin slayer anime ends in the manga?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i haven't had time to watch the anime yet, what does it end on? i can tell you the corresponding chapter
Bill: Itâ€™s apparently out of order... they did the water capital, farm siege...
Bill: *Ashâ€™s Pikachu is the anchor for PokÃ©mon loops, lol*
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): orly? that's fun
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): if i remember correctly they just finished the water capital in the manga. farm siege was a while ago. it's about to kick into a festival
Bill: Ooooooh William in TROUBLEEEEE

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): 
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): two people who are inseparable but 500% fed up with each other
Bill: Oh Iâ€™ve read that. She cute in the color art.

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): oh man it might even be a finale announcement
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): has anyone read The Promised Neverland
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): there's a cafe opening for it nearby and the drinks have the kid's tattoo numbers on them and i can't tell if that's cute/quirky or insanely messed up. bit of both i guess.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): so psyched for the anime i've seen promos for it around department stores and it looks so good
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That sounds like identification numbers and scary
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): :3c
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): 
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): 
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): 
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): all i can think of is some poor housewife bringing her kids here and being like "so what do the numbers on the drinks mean?" and the kids have to explain while the mother listens in horror
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Are they prisoners in the manga?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): you should read it and find out!!!
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): the beginning is like yona where something suddenly changes everything
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): they're not exactly prisoners? they aren't in prison
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): GOOD
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): NNNAAAAAAAAAA

Bill: <@!301927856240459777> waaaaake uppppp I gotta go through the season chart.
Bill: `Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen` this sounds cute but I also know it's probably a disappointment. 

`Manaria Friends` seems neat. 

`Revisions` sounds like a knock off, can't remember of what. The one with Slaine?
Bill: There's one about hot boy DJs.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): So many anime about hot boy DJs. Thatâ€™s the new Hip Cool Swag
Ooo is kaguya sama getting an anime? Thatâ€™s fun
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Was everyone in the sever just in a voice chat or did I dream that
Bill: dreamed it.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Darn, trying to be part of it is what woke me up but it makes sense because there were like ten people in auriiâ€™s voice chat
