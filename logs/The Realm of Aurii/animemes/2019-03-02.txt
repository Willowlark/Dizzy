N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a Saeran Appreciation Discord™
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): "MysMes boys who have a kiss CG club"
N🆗ri (Marisa): even jaehee does lol rip v
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG yeaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm thinking maybe V is ace? 
Maybe?
N🆗ri (Marisa): that'd be cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): explains the no hug and foster kid
N🆗ri (Marisa): and bad end
Aldus Larian (Jess): He has no kiss cg, he doesn't ever imply sex like alot of the other boys, in one flashback Rika harasess him about never wanting to have sex, him and mc adopt
N🆗ri (Marisa): there is one pic i just saw but i have this in my clipboard let me paste it brb
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea like he doesn't want to get involved in the bad end activities he just wants to photograph them
N🆗ri (Marisa): this but they fully clothed 👌 👌 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): good guy v
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea all vs content is PG rated
N🆗ri (Marisa): despite his route having the age warning at the beginning lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I was thinking about how people were so mad over no kisses and that got me thinking. But I originally thought it in the Rika flashback
Aldus Larian (Jess): She like yells at him for not wanting to have sex with her and he says something like "I'm not like that" or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): This has been V theories with Jess <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): encore! encore!
Aldus Larian (Jess): And I'm all out of theories
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like the V is ace theory it makes sense and bumps up my respect for blind boy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Right? I think it makes alot of sence
Aldus Larian (Jess): I've seen "jumin is ace" theories but never V and I don't agree with jumin being ace cuz he says many low key sexual things
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah jumin is kink master supreme
N🆗ri (Marisa): actually that would be zen but jumin is next in line for the throne
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like every other boy, by the time you get to end of the route there are like "ayyy MC 😉"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like V is def romantic af but doesn't seem interested in sex at all from what I can recall
Aldus Larian (Jess): He's like "omg hugs are where it at 👌"
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah he's big romantic, he pulls those crazy stunts and does all that artsy stuff as big flashy signs of romance
N🆗ri (Marisa): chocolate pyramids
N🆗ri (Marisa): the whole nine yards

Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'M FUCKING CACKLING I LOVE THESE
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooo apparently it's the spaceship
the spaceship that reveals thoughts shows that V thinks about cacti a lot
Aldus Larian (Jess): OHH ok that makes sense
Aldus Larian (Jess): i love the spaceship
N🆗ri (Marisa): he says stuff like "Should I buy another mini cactus and decorate it?"
*another??*
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
