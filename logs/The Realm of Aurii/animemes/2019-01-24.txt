NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): this is a remake/reboot of a show from the 60s but it's quite different from the original
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i want karamatsu to be my favorite character but he also pooped on a table in starbucks to embarass his brother so maybe not
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): and he always tries stuff like this

NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): how strong is your adblocker
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): uhhhh i have "fair ad blocker"
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i used to use batoto but that went down so then i moved to kissmanga but it sucks now and will destroy everything you love so now i use mangakakalot. people also like mangarock and mangareader but i like how mangakakalot highlights chapters i've already read without needing to make an account
Dirty Lego (Tom): Tokyo ghoul has been taken down on manga rock   <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Was the first one Google yielded
Dirty Lego (Tom): And welcome babe
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): you can find it on tumblr but they guard their scans very protectively so it's like a big scavenger hunt looking for passwords and traversing blogs for links and hints to the manga scans
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): https://mangakakalot.com/search/tokyo_ghoul
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's beautiful
Dirty Lego (Tom): There itnis
Dirty Lego (Tom): https://manganelo.com/chapter/read_tokyo_ghoulre/chapter_125

Dirty Lego (Tom): Guess this is technically bobbies physics material but oh well
Dirty Lego (Tom): Nsfw warning yall
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Dirty Lego (Tom): I will keep this chapter open on my phone and read it once per day
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "when twink boi gets RIPPED"
Dirty Lego (Tom): That brief flashback ðŸ‘Œ
Dirty Lego (Tom): Remember when you were skinny and I made fun of you all the time
Dirty Lego (Tom): Your still skinny but also ripped somehow ðŸ‘Œ
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this chapter watered my crops and sleared my skin
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): is that like the one chapter of sword art online where it's just lewd
how dare
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that chapter was horrible
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this like written one? like the "fanfic for my own series" one?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that was sooo bad
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ~~so you read it eh~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz i was like "i ship these charaters, i would have liked for them to have had sex at this point" and then it was like some 12 yr old wrote about tittie
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and kirito was so out of character
Dirty Lego (Tom): So much more love and less grossness
Dirty Lego (Tom): Tokyo ghoul one is soooo much better
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like this they are still themselves ~~although who the fuck is kaneki anyway~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i wanna go read the SAO one to compare it now
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmao TRUE
Dirty Lego (Tom): Kaneki is either depressed, happy, cruel and has one of 5 hair colors
Dirty Lego (Tom): That boy had some personality issues
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like the SAO just felt like classic porn bullshit and this one feels like real, actual relationship sex
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): best quality: her wiggles
https://i.redd.it/gl5i0t8l30c21.gif
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): can't do lewd stuff if you're a rock
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): u sure?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): wait no stop
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): *you used the premise of the show against me*
Bill: ~~bold of you to assume the author of SAO knows anything about real sex~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): maybe the rocks know more than he does
Bill: ~~well they are always hard~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~after reading it, i knew it he didnt~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): this episode was banned on tv in a bunch of different countries despite having a ton of crucial plot stuff in it
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ~~so you all read it~~
Bill: YEARS ago.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i read it like last year
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was SOOOO bad
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): [looks into the camera like The Office]
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like you can tell he just had a boner and was like "yea im gonna write this"
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): there's a manga like that. i thought it updated yesterday but luckily it was another manga with a similar name.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): there's a lot of manga like that
Bill: well, it was posted back when SAO was a web novel, no publisher. It may have literally been smutty drabble and he was like 'fuck it I'll post it'.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea, still disappointing tho XD
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah it was so bad
Bill: https://moesucks.com/2019/01/23/tate-no-yuusha-no-nariagari-ep-3-picking-and-choosing-when-to-be-heroic/ blogs be *shitting* on shield hero for having slavery be accepted.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): whoever wrote this obviously hasn't watched enough anime then
Bill: That's exactly why tho. Recent isekai are all doing it and this was the straw that broke the camel's back.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): the author is complaining about a lot of stuff that's explained
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): like why raphtalia is older and why her level is higher
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): he should complain on an isekai that actually treats its slaves horribly then
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): slavery is bad but the slaves that naofumi has aren't treated like slaves
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): slavery was just the only way he could get a fighting party together. which, yeah, bad. another way could've been developed.
Bill: ~~no isekai hero treats slaves horribly, because he Nice Guy â„¢~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): raphtalia grew older because beastmen's physical in this world is tied to their level. she's a higher level than naofumi now because all he has is a shield and raphtalia is doing all the fighting, he's siphoning exp from her kills like a true party system
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): nah u haven't read enough isekai
Bill: Anime is anime, but I do give credit to the complaint that she's loyal and loving and stuff, but also has a magic slave crest.
Bill: ~~but I don't expect anything out of isekai anime so shrug~~
Bill: Raphtalia does like adorable tho.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): it took them like 10 seasons but they finally got a good transformation down pat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAgz0Au-xhg
Bill: did... she just do the chicken dance?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): magic dance
Dirty Lego (Tom): Raphtalia is smol blazblue makoto
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): nothing beats kamichama karin's transformation phrase of "i am god"
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): u know who else danced
princess tutu
what a good show
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): katsucon is always princess tutu con
Bill: 
Bill: I don't quite get "angry piss baby" but seeing bees would be spook.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmao
Bill: I wish I was a writer. I can't get the idea of a Jessica Jones/Blake Adam storyline cross over out of my head.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): time for a fav MM meme of mine, since Erik was talking about the social medias watching you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Bill: I haven't made a bit about V needing love in forever wow.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hes fine
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Bill: ~~in reality dumping your self loathing on people isn't attractive right~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nope
Bill: Does this mean MC plays LOL.
Bill: oof.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but this is âœ¨  fantasy âœ¨
Bill: *Just checking*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive seen these memes like 400 times and they still make me lol everytime
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmao
Dirty Lego (Tom): Damn who's that
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ðŸ‘€
