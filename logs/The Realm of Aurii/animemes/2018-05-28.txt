Nokri (Marisa): another story's prologue is super long <:rip:369476083248267274>
i think it took me over an hour to finish the prologue and the first chatroom
Aldus (Jess): Yea! I just got done with the prologue damn that was long
Aldus (Jess): I love how MC can be thirsty for Ray right off the bat 😂
Nokri (Marisa): insta temptation
Aldus (Jess): I'm going to attempt to get Vs route first. I allready broke a ray heart and now I cry 😭
Nokri (Marisa): *how could you he’s so innocent*
Aldus (Jess): I know I'm terrible 😭
Aldus (Jess): Honestly my stomach drops whenever I get a broken heart for anyone 😂
Nokri (Marisa): What did you say to him?
Nokri (Marisa): That made it break do you remember or did you repress the memory
Aldus (Jess): It was like a text message and he was "so you like anyone yet?" And the options were either him or v and I answered V cuz im trying to get Vs route first and he was like 💔 "you shouldnt trust that one"
Nokri (Marisa): Hehehe rip ray
Nokri (Marisa): Good answer for V route but so sad
Nokri (Marisa): Text broken hearts especially are the worst because they aren’t immediate
Aldus (Jess): I'm not prepared to break this bois heart. But as soon as v routes done I go save him
Nokri (Marisa): Boi has a heart of glass jess you gotta smash it into a million pieces with a rock hammer
Aldus (Jess): 😭😭😭
Nokri (Marisa): Then we can suffer together waiting for the after ending
Aldus (Jess): Yea! It'll be great!
Aldus (Jess): Honestly I feel like if I did Ray's route first I wouldn't wanna do vs so that's why I'm starting with v
Nokri (Marisa): True that’s probably 100% true
Nokri (Marisa): Plus the ending for V’s is insane
Aldus (Jess): Yeaaaa I've seen enough spoilers to know I wouldn't 😂
Aldus (Jess): ~~wow I though seven calling mc crying on jumins route was bad can't wait for that ray call on Vs route~~
Nokri (Marisa): Rays voice actor is the best
