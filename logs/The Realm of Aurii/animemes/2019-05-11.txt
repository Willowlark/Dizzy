Elfriede Faun (Tom): Like it's 8 years ago
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Need a Lenny face but with Lens hair, know what I mean?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Rinny and Lenny
Bill: Not a huge fan of this tournament arc for one punch.
Bill: Wow Tohru‚Äôs family are a bunch of dicks.
Bill: This whole leaving arc feels weird to me.
Bill: Like.
Bill: I get she wasn‚Äôt close to the grandfather.
Bill: But.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm so disappointed in the new episode
they totally changed it from the original anime so what used to be the funniest episode in the entire series is just a dull slice of life fest
Nokri (Marisa): i get that the original anime was highly flawed in terms of loyalty to the original manga *but that episode was so good why'd they have to totally change it*
i was really looking forward to it
Bill: I love dog guy. Really do.
Nokri (Marisa): he's a lot more toned down in a good way
he used to be all "high school girl! living in my house! whee! i love high school girls"
Bill: Low key hate how Rat constantly takes Kyo‚Äôs cool moments.
Bill: *oh look symbolism of being finally chosen by someone*
Bill: It‚Äôs just like... kinda a strange scenario. I guess she is leaving a ‚Äúbad‚Äù home life for a better one, but like... this is usually a finale that comes with a confession of love, not a confession of family.
Bill: Suppose the show has a strong theme of family tho.
Bill: *I swear to god tho if Yuki wins imma hate this series*
Bill: Tohru
Leans down
‚ÄúMC it you‚Äù
Nokri (Marisa): They her family now they can‚Äôt marry her, that‚Äôs incest <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i dont understand why u dislike Yuki so much but ok~~
~~maybe it's something I don't know yet~~
Nokri (Marisa): I think he‚Äôs only seen the same episodes as you? Is that tru
Bill: I don‚Äôt hate him but he constantly one ups Kyo.
Bill: I don‚Äôt like that.
Bill: Haha. I guess it‚Äôs the same reason Tohru gives for liking the cat zodiac.
Bill: *Im a waifu girl now*
Bill: But yuki always better than kyo, never giving Kyo a break... I don‚Äôt think Kyo is perfect by any means, but I hate seeing him struggle like that.
Bill: And it‚Äôs a conscious decision from Yuki to do that to him.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~kyos so salty tho~~
Nokri (Marisa): They established that wasn‚Äôt true, that Yuki wasn‚Äôt one upping Kyo all the time. They‚Äôre just jealous of each other and trying to ‚Äúwin‚Äù in their own ways. Yuki can beat him up but Kyo can actually interact with people at school
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it seems like kyo is pretty damn obsessed with competing with him too
Bill: Kyo HELLA salty. He ain‚Äôt great either, has lots of character development to do.
Aldus Larian (Jess): They seem to have that whole sibling rivalry thing from both sides to me
Nokri (Marisa): If anyone is always one upping Kyo it‚Äôs Kagura owo
Bill: But like, Yuki beats Kyo up and holds his superiority in things over Kyo. He actively does that. 

Kyo is better with people and is more normal, but that‚Äôs just him being himself? Yuki is jealous but it‚Äôs not something Kyo is doing TO Yuki.
Nokri (Marisa): They‚Äôre like 15 years old
Aldus Larian (Jess): Kyo literally was introduced by falling through the roof to literally beat yuki. Or am I remembering it wrong?
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's what happened right?
Nokri (Marisa): Ye he fell through the roof but then Yuki messed him up for messing up the roof
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh ok
Nokri (Marisa): I don‚Äôt think Yuki could break through the roof though
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea imma go with sibling rivalry. There's def thing the other one does that they are jelly of
Bill: Oh yeah.
Bill: Idk I just feel like Yuki is more... mean about it.
Bill: Maybe I somehow associate more with Kyo so I want to take Kyo‚Äôs side?
Bill: I don‚Äôt see how, I‚Äôm not sociable or a martial art geek.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean you can be partial to a character without having to associate with them
Bill: ~~I guess I can be kinda snarky and tsundere tho~~
Bill: I think it‚Äôs association cause at the same time I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwow Kyo dumb as fuck‚Äù.
Nokri (Marisa): kyo's not really snarky, everything just gets under his skin
yuki's the snarky one <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea kyos just annoyed by everything
Aldus Larian (Jess): During the last episode all I thought when kagura put down his eggy was
"What is this?"
"Affection"
"Disgusting"
Aldus Larian (Jess): But then not the "do it again" part
Bill: That‚Äôs a better description of Kyo yeah.
Bill: ~~comparison still valid oops~~
Bill: Yeah I totally think I‚Äôm associating with Kyo and don‚Äôt like Yuki because of all the reasons Kyo doesn‚Äôt like Yuki. The subconscious is great.
Nokri (Marisa): do we get under your skin all the time? üôÄ
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wut you're nothing like kyo
Nokri (Marisa): he's finally coming out as a furry
Bill: You right Kyo popular <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I love Tohru‚Äôs friends so much.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg no ~~I think kyos a bit of a lil bitch~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I'm giving him a chance
Nokri (Marisa): biru is saying he related to stalking people from the treetops and crashing in roofs to fight his cousins
Bill: Oh he is lol.
Bill: No ones perfect.
Bill: *except Tohru, but her being so perfect is her problem*
Bill: God, whoever ends up with Tohru is going to have serious issues thinking they‚Äôre not worthy of her ridiculously unselfish love.
Bill: Which part of the new one got cut down?
Bill: ~~anytime Tohru‚Äôs face isn‚Äôt visible I think she‚Äôs MC~~
Nokri (Marisa): the new episode?
Nokri (Marisa): ||the slumber party was an absolute mess in the original. everyone kept bumping into each other and transforming and frantically attempting to hide their transformation until eventually shigure, yuki, and kyo were just casually naked in the garden trying to come up with excuses||
Bill: DAMN
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A HUGE COMEDIC EPISODE BUT NOPE
Bill: || If you said the culture festival was the cut part I wouldn‚Äôt have cared cause culture festivals are a dime a dozen but the slumber party had so much POTENTIAL ||
Nokri (Marisa): ||naw yeah, some little things got cut from the culture festival i think? but all the main stuff was there. the slumber party was SO different||
Bill: Fucking rip
Nokri (Marisa): ||kyo frantically running down the stairs with everyone's clothes before he transforms back, shigure casually pretending to be a neighbor's dog, yuki getting stuck in the kitchen as a rat while uo-chan is getting drinks and she mistakes him as part of a pile of onigiri or something. it was SO good.||
Bill: I‚Äôm so sad.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Time to watch this episode, then go watch the original version of that episode
Nokri (Marisa): YES PLEASE
Nokri (Marisa): if funi doesn't have the original (which they should it's like 90% of their existence) i can find it for ya
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Kk fam, do the episode numbers line up?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nooo babe!
Aldus Larian (Jess): U gotta wait for me
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh ofc silly, not now
Nokri (Marisa): original is episode 6
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): ||the new anime put things out of order from both the first anime and the manga. originally, the "slumber party"/visit was before the culture festival. and in the original anime, the slumber party/visit and the culture festival were 2 different episodes that each took up 1 whole episode||
Nokri (Marisa): ||so slumber party is 6 and culture festival is 7||
