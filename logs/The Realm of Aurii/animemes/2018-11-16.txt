Bill: oh wow I remember that.
Bill: I'm watching the second season of Seven Deadly Sins since it on netflix...
Bill: Meliodas does way more molesting than I remember and it's like, ooc, annoying, and excessive...
Bill: And they introduced a concept of 'power levels' so now every other conversation involves someone talking about someone else's number.
Bill: I liked the first season damnit.
Bill: So like. Theyâ€™re doing a fighting tournament arc. And instead of sitting on the side lines, the non combatant girlfriends of the main characters got paired off... and they basically gossip through their fight (they havenâ€™t meet before) and son.
Bill: Then the guys accidentally win their match while arguing whose girlfriend is best.
