Total Nok-out (Marisa): it's about a girl named Katarina who bumps her head and remembers her past life as a japanese high schooler, and realizes she's living her new life and the villain/rival of the last dating game she played in her past life
Total Nok-out (Marisa): all endings of the game end with her being either exiled from the country and homeless, or sentenced to death/killed. she doesn't want that so her entire life becomes built around avoiding these endings.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh whoa

Bill: This fic has some great lines.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): is that about bakugo
Bill: Bingo.
Bill: ~~or is it~~
Bill: `‚ÄúBakugou‚Äôs expression was doing an interesting dance between irritable scowling and begrudging respect. It was like he wanted to be angry but was reconsidering things on the fly and hated that he was reconsidering things so he was angry about that. He seemed conflicted.

¬†

Or maybe he had to poop.‚Äù`

Bill: I miss that design tbh.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i miss being able to hang 90 keychains from your phone and also charging while listening to music

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): now shes asking yukine why he hangs out with yato cuz hes "too pure for that"
Bill: You can tell it‚Äôs a young audience writing the Bnha fanfic... Lots of mental health talk. Granted, I‚Äôm only 2 in.
Bill: ~~I had to filter a few when I saw the bakugo kiri tags~~
Bill: I just do not get that. Or... a majority of the ships for bnha.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean I get why people shit it I just don't think bakugo should date anyone üòÇ
Bill: Also the sheer amount of hugging shows they don‚Äôt realize Japanese people don‚Äôt do physical contact much.
Bill: Why is everyone gay?
