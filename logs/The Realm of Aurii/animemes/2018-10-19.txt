Bill: Only have the last episode of first season left: I don't think it would not be wrong to say Mina and Uraraka did absolutely nothing in this season.
Bill: Otherwise know as "If you are not Bakugo, Kirishima, Todoroki, or Deku you can't do anything"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mina doesn't really do much I just like her personality
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Urakaka does stuff later on but her main purpose to to like Deku
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Iida does stuff, I feel like Tsuyu (sp?) Does stuff
Bill: I knew that going in, shounen anime is about as progressive as those 50's ads.
Bill: God forbid a *woman* get in a fight and *do something* other than serve as a damsel in distress.
Bill: Plot hole what, 3 now? There is no way in hell Mineta passed the combat exam.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea mineta is shit, I haven't seen many shounens but there seem to at least be more women in bnha? Also there's more female characters later on, and yea the girls do things later on too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The boys are def the main stars tho I won't argue with that
Bill: Number doesn't matter much, it's the fact that they do nothing.
Bill: Too many characters, too weak character, so they get no screen time.
Bill: Kaminari is given a real short stick. He could be on par with at least Kirishima, if not Todoroki if they didn't give him an excessive nerf.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Y u watch if you no like tho?
Bill: I dunno if anyone's put together a definitive list of reasons why women get the short stick. I chalk it up to 1. shounen are for boys and girls are icky and 2. no one wants to be the guy who draws women getting hurt (unless your the goblin slayer guy).
Bill: I don't hate it.
Bill: When Deku shuts up and does something he can be surprisingly cool. While Bakugo seems to have *no personality whatsoever* he's fun to watch (when he's not being an edgelord). Aizawa is *baller* and All Might can be pretty fun.
Bill: Just why make characters that deserve screen time and then *shaft them* so Deku can angst, miss a punch, and break a leg?
Bill: It's disappointing.
Bill: ~~also there are 60 some odd episodes and I need distractions, this works pretty well~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What works?
Bill: And if anyone want them, I may now have seasons 1-3 in dual audio files. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Watching BNHA. as a distraction.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo
Bill: We'll see if I can survive a tournament arc.
Bill: Also the first quirk was a baby who shed light. Tell me someone didn't try and sell him as the second coming of jesus.
Bill: They've been in school less than a *week, nani*.
Bill: How is it already the sports festival.
Bill: Huh. So UA sports festival is a sporting event on par with the olympics.
Bill: I feel like there should be a pro's fighting circuit as well?
Bill: Like UA is college football and then there should be a pro tier?
Bill: All Might: So you have no control over your power huh. How you going to compete?
Deku: *Maybe you could actually teach me something*
Bill: The art shift is nice though.
Bill: ~~they're complaining about midnight's outfit and not Momos?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Who?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I compain about Momo's all the time
Bill: in show they complain about dominatrix pro, but not Momo.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh yea
Bill: > Everyone: you can't be a hero without a quirk Deku
> Deku: Solves all his problems without using all for one because it breaks his bones
> *Did... you need this quirk?*
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Hewwo anime talk OwO
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): People without quirks are kind of secondrate citizens. Even if people don’t treat them differently at first because it’s impossible to tell just by looking, it’d wreck havoc on their mental state and also probably lead to more unfair treatment than just bullying (like workplace discrimination and inability to be hired)
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): The canon spin-off has a quirkless vigilante a la Batman
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Also Old speedy zoom guy later calls all might out on teaching deku nothing
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: All might is not a teacher lmao
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: **Queue scene were all might has the teaching for dummies in his back pocket**
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): YEAH! All Might is flashy and bluffs his way through doing everything and somehow it works but achieves nothing
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): all might 100% popular jock
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yep and we love him for it
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): MOU TELE IS ENDING SOON
IT'S ENDING AFTER THE NEXT VOLUME
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): AAAAAAAAA
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): like i'm happy it's not gonna continue on forever and it has a concrete conclusion bUT AA
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Same
Bill: I am *so* disappointed Kaminari is nerfed to hell.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: You are *so* disappointed by the entire show
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): what about sero? true unsung hero there.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: TAPE BOI
Bill: Oooh yeah, Tape boi is pretty legit too.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): apparently people ship them
Bill: *why*
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): ~~both idiots?~~ 
both underappreciated
Bill: half the cast is underappreciated.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): give us more koji and sato. especially koji.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): sato and momo would've been much much better interns for fatgum
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): fghjmkljhgfc
Bill: I love tail guy.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): OH YEAH he exists too!
Bill: He sees Deku being a huge fucking nerd and he's like 'huh. I should chat with him, he's smart.'
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): ~~biru's inner furry speaking~~
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): people ship him with kaminari too
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): though it looks like he's more popular with hagakure
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Wow kaminari is thinking about 707
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Wut a legend
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Isn't kaminari the leader of team instinct?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YE
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): omg yeah that's him
Bill: pfft true
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): hewwo 👀 😍
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: 
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): also deku as yoosung makes a lot of sense but would be absolutely awful to keep being compared to all might
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Hewwoallmightdaddy
Bill: ooo. If I used BESM for a BNHA game, I could give extra points for non combat quirks... I like that idea.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Cuz no one compares
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Sorry Marisa, all might is gay for Dave
Bill: TRUTH
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That is a good smol might art tho 👌👌👌
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): i want to be one of all might's children
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): omg did i ever post the comic of deku being out late at night
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): YOU STOP WITH THOSE REACTS
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: 👶
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: *it's okay, all might is amazing*
Bill: > The entire class: "I can't believe Bakugo would hurt a girl"
> Urararaka: "I'm so scared Bakugo could hurt me"
> Deku: "Bakugo is a big enough dick to hurt a girl"
> *Urararaka is training to be a pro hero, in the best hero training program in the world*
> *Urararaka wants to fight villains which are going to absolutely try and kill her*
> QED: Bakugo would be doing her a disservice by pulling punches
> Also QED: Everyone in UA is retarded.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): oh just you wait
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): just u wait biru
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): u will like that one part
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): just like i love this comic
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Oh yeah that comic is a classic
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YES
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: My favorite part is how the third panel the speech bubble hides his hair peaking over the chair
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mom and Dad are teaming up
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: And where are his legs aghhhhh
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): he had them up against his chest until he dramatically spun around <:lenny:395307171539189760>
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 6 more minutes until hooky updates hh
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Ah yes of course, my mistake
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Oh nice <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Oh of course, Aizawa realizes this is a real life scenario.
Bill: Damn they're trying to make bakugo out as a villain.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): aizawa has faced many hardships
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: YO YOUR NAME SHOULD BE.....

EEERAASUUUHEEDDDOOO
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: "K"
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): yeah bakugo is weird in that he's good but bad. he's got an explosive temper but his intentions are good and he has high grades. he idolizes all might nearly as much as midoriya does (just not as otaku about it as deku), he's just got a serious inferiority complex
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah I really enjoy how they explain how intelligent he really is but you can't tell cuz he's so mad
Bill: I'm more poking fun at the writing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~lowkey don't like him but don't tell anyone~~
Bill: They keep putting him in scenarios that make him look evil.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He's gotten a little better but yea
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Later arcs he comes around a bit but when you watch the first few episodes your like... Wow fuck this kid,someone arrest him for.ying my sweet angel
Bill: Also Uraraka had a big fight and proved she's a strong person on her own. THEN she comes back and is a moe blob to Deku like she didn't grow at all.
Bill: Bakugo is a straight up bully, which makes his idolization in BNE weird.
Bill: I thought there was a reason to it, but it's supposed to be what, Deku tried to help him up once?
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): i think they primarily like him because shipping
Bill: ~~Kirishima is a bland character tho~~
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): YOU TAKE THAT BACK
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 
Bill: ,... no?
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): being nice is basically part of his quirk
Bill: I'm only 23 episodes in, but he's just like 'yo what up'.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): he getsa lot more characterization in the manga (and maybe the third season? i haven't seen it yet)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Remind me again why you are watching this show
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): probably starts around the time tetsu x4 shows up
Bill: it's amusing?
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Bakugo is more relatable in later arcs and a huge asshole in early onea
Bill: I'm sad and there's lots of episodes?
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: And kirishima is great
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: And totally not the same character as the metal dude 👌
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): they're like. total opposites.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea, I liked him right away
Bill: Thus far I am not impressed with Kirishima. He's nice, but nothing special.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Sometimes blind niceness is well recieved
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Like ARRRUMIGHTOOO
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): also he gots pointy teeth
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye! Nice happy go lucky characters are great
Bill: Like, that's great, I just don't understand the absolute love for him.
Bill: All Might deserves his adoration.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): he's a cinnamon roll
Bill: Deku is pretty cool when he shuts up and punches stuff.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: *Tamaki whispering to self in corner*
Bill: who
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Someone draw him wearing an Ouran highschool uniform
Bill: Oh, and Aizawa is the only intelligent person in the show.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): LOOK AT THIS POOR BOY HURTING HIMSELF WITH HIS QUIRK
his hero suit has arm pads just so he can carry people without hurting them while his quirk is in use
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): before UA he didn't dye or style his hair
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): This is Kiri?!
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): ya!
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: He looks so much better with his hair down tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Why baby boi cru?!!

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's a good AU
Bill: fucking bless.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Thank  god
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Not sure who I ship Jiro with
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I dont think I have any ships yet?
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I feel like denki is the only choice but idk she seems to self sufficient
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): yeah that's mega popular
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Omg can we talk about the scene where Tsuyu is cradled up in a ball hibernating
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: The most pure thing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YAS
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: 
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: The **mostpure**

To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): jirou is the glue that keeps those two from dying
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): honestly if anyones the sexy boi to me, its todoroki
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): im not a bakugo or kiri girl
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): kiri is more friend material imho
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): todoroki is cool because he'll say totally normal things but have those intense action lines drawn around him as though it's super dramatic
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): 
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): hes the type of edgy i can get behind
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): and kaminari is just my son
Bill: emotionless isn't really your track record.
Bill: going to watch 24 so I can say I watched two seasons tonight.

one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): season 1 is 13 season 2-3 are 25
watch them all
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): no sleep
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): theres very limited husbandos in this show
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): deku is too weak sauce
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): bakugo is just angery incarnate
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): todoroki............ edgy boi but i dig ice zuko
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): kirishima..... comic relief but manly
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): all might is the flashy over the top husbando we all need
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): kaminari....... even more comic releif but actually stupid
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): tru
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): all might is too good for me
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): all might is good enough for everyone
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): hooky's update is late hhh i can just sit here and admire monica

one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): she was my least favorite design at first but now she's my fave
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): OH NO IT'S ON HIATUS NOW IT JUST UPDATED TO A PAUSE BUTTON
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): are funko pop really popular at all
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): is that real
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): ya. is that a good or bad thing.
https://www.amazon.com/Funko-POP-Animation-Collectible-Multicolor/dp/B07D7P47LY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1539923894&sr=8-2&keywords=todoroki+funko+pop
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): i think funko pop always look kind of bad and everyone always jokes about them. i thought it would die out quickly but it's going stronger than ever so it must be popular?
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): yeah i dont like their beady little eyes
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): it works for some characters but not many
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): like i like my power armor and vault boy funkos
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): but not the harry potter ones i won
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *shows up 8 hrs late*
DID SOMEONE SAY TODOROKI
GEORGIA WE HAVE THE SAME BNHA HUSBANDO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also I actually like pops most of the time some times they are bad but they allow to have figures of characters I like for cheap and often male figures arnt available unless they are really spence so Ill take it 😂
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): How much do they cost? I figured collectors items so expensive
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): :0
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like $7-$12?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ish
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Unless they are like not in production anymore or something
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): omg that’s insanely reasonable
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye! So that's why I like dem
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah lmao, todoroki is more tho
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Cuz he's special
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: He's like 25
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~but I needs it~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My mom asked me what I was for Christmas

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ommgggg 😂😂
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Omggg
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): HOOKY UPDATED TODAY AFTER ALL gasp
Hurry up train I have a heartwarming and awkward reunion to read
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You come into my house, you disrespect my children, don't talk to me or my 6 husbands and wife ever again.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Omg do you know this person
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also pretty sure there's never more than a 3 hour break between chats esspcially during the day 🤷
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nah, they reply to my story alot tho
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): You could pay if you wanted to do the chats faster or catch up on missed chats. I like the way they’re spaced
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Omg this is war
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They respond to the most random stories of mine and talk about how they've never seen squirrels or pumpkins cuz they live in the Netherlands
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont even know what tosay XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 1. you're wrong cuz the average time between chats is always 2-3 hrs
2. as long as you do that chats during the day you can pay for the night ones no problem
Bill: ~~It's still a pretty bs way to make a game~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean yea i get why people done like that, I personally think it makes the game more immersive but he dont even know da facts here
Bill: Technically what they said isn't wrong.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they make it sounds like theres like 40 chats at night and none at daytime
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean no they arent straight up wrong, but a little inaccurate. i bassically just responded with "the chats are 2-3 hrs apart, you can buy them back easily without spending real money, i like the immersion"
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Yeah it’s much better than most mobile games where you have to wait 3 days to unlock a tree
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA like  i cant knock 40+ hours of game play that can be easily achieved for free. i spent money on another story but honestly you could pay more for DLC on a game that you allready bought for $60 and no one bats an eye
Bill: rip Iida's brother man.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: ☝
Bill: why are there no third years in the finals of the sports festival?

Bill: ~~oh shoot there are after credit scenes?~~
Bill: I've been skipping them.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): o yeah! some episodes. most don't do much but in the second season some get pretty important
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): y'always gotta watch the end and sing along. season 2 end is a jam.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Issue... That Kiki's?
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I don't recognize it and I've watched like four Ghibli movies in the past year
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): whisper of the heart!
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): watch that before watching the cat returns
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): it's the inspiration for fallout, probably.
https://vimeo.com/183917521
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Oo NICU!
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Haven't heard of that yet
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I'mma watch Kiki's, castle in the sky, and ponyo. Then prob that and cat returns, grave of the fireflies
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i gotta see arriety still
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): which ones have you seen so far?
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): poppy hill is one of my favorite ghiblis, the cleaning scene is awesome
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): only totoro, spirted away, mononoke, and howls moving castle
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): ~~i have a ton of the DVDs we can have movie night~~
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): which was your fave?
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): i think i have arrietty, ponyo, poppy hill, the wind rises, pom poko, castle in the sky, and all the ones you listed on DVD.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Bill: why didn't you see Arriety with us when we saw it in theatres?
Bill: Me Tom and Hopf went when it was out.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz i had a v. negative opinion of anime at the time
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): u wot now
Bill: still? I thought it was relatively recently.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you guys went and saw that like right after we staerted dating
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): arietty is like 2010
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): basically i though all anime was very hentia-y and my bf liking it was very uncomfortable for me at the time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye we started dating may 2010
Bill: oh shit. I thought that was after I went to college.
Bill: I guess we lost Hopf after graduation, but.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): for non-ghibli standalone movies i also have wolf children, summer wars, your name, the boy and the beast, the girl who leapt through time, paprika, tekkonkinkreet, in this corner of the world, and i'm really really hoping to get sayonara no asa when it comes out ~~in japan it gets released this week~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i mean NOW i know better but yea, i didnt like anime cuz it was an unknown for me at hte time
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): mystery cartoons
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IVE SEEN PAPRIKA
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): catchy music
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea onle anime things i saw before tom were paprika, spirted away, death note and like 3 eps of vampire knight and that was all because of my friend aliza
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): lol paprika is so out of place in that list
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the kind of animes tom liked at the time abd had pics of on his walls were almost all female casts, or all females wth one guy and that made me feel weird at the time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i dont remeber paprika like at all
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): i'm a bit sad my anime/manga collection is out of date, it basically stopped growing after we moved ~~and there was no room for it because it's huge~~
that makes sense. most anime posters are v ecchi
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): paprika is like a dream
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i remember it being pretty trippy
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): man remember borders
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): when they went out of business
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): i legit bought like 200 manga
