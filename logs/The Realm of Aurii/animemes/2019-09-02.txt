Bill: Kanons female school uniforms are just ridiculous. Meanwhile the guys have grey slacks and a blue blazer. Not even a specific one, just. Off the rack.
Bill: Watched a few episodes with Jen and Jeremy.
Bill: I might binge toradora today.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH
Bill: I started to smell onions when ryuuji cut onions. Weird.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Going through old cards,look at this boi
Bill: Pokémon: a balanced game.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's the best bird at the deli
Nokri (Marisa): Delibird is the best Pokémon period
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I like how he's slanted
Nokri (Marisa): Gearing up to naruto run
Bill: Taiga is great when she’s not doing the loli tsundere kuga rie trope.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **egg time**
Bill: These anime friendships get me every time.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yum egg
El🆓de Faun (Tom): THE TOMATE MAKE IT NOT WANNA ROLL
El🆓de Faun (Tom): This is the least cylindrical tamagoyaki of all time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

Nokri (Marisa): gotta give akko the bottom bunk because she'd fall off otherwise
Bill: Toradora is so good. So much emotion.
Bill: This was a good idea.
Bill: I didn’t remember anything past the beach arc tbh.
Bill: Taiga beating the shit out of the girl who refused to reject/accept Kitamura’s public confession is like.
Bill: Friend goals. Though I’m pretty sure it’s also selfish in a way.
Bill: Also great was Kitamura being like “following that first step (in joining student council), I’ve had fun and made friends and loved it. But I can’t bring myself to make the next step forward” and said girl (the current president he’d be replacing) was like “you’ve already made the first step, now you’re on the path and you have to keep going, for everyone whose supported you forward”. Then she literally pushed him the last step of a staircase. 

I’m pretty bad at parsing out subtext from tv, I don’t get very cerebral when I’m watching emotions fly like that, but that was some good advice.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nice
