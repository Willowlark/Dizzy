Tikur (Kurtis): Fox girls
Nokri (Marisa): FOX GORLS WOO
Tikur (Kurtis): It's so cray but I love it
Tikur (Kurtis): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ISEKAI TIEM
Nokri (Marisa): if you like those series i also recommend this one. different author but similar vibes

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cept what would nausicaa be then
Elfriede Faun (Tom): When you wanna protect a character that has no redeeming qualities but you love them anyways
Tikur (Kurtis): My last two brain cells
Bill: Popularity poll for Shield Hero, <@!141729881779077121> and <@!301927856240459777> are most popular because they are <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): andru i have to kill you
Nokri (Marisa): to become the most popular
Andrew: ill become a martyr
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Marisa sonce you read manga mostly when something finally gets an anime series does it sometimes make you sad when it gets popular and it's not as exclusive? 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): i considered making a tiny baby filo but no time
Andrew: and become more powerful than you can imagine
Andrew: im gonan get balloons i think
Andrew: gotta have them
Nokri (Marisa): a little? <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
i like that it gets more popular and there are more fans of it, but oftentimes when something gets an anime the fandom starts blowing things out of proportion. it kind of changes the characters if that makes sense.
I like to stick with canon as much as possible so when a show suddenly gets mega popular, people often cut characters down to two or three basic traits and a lot is lost from the original
Nokri (Marisa): i like memes but also my favorite series are for the angst and tragedy so sometimes the fandom makes everything a little too joke-y and overplays the same joke over and over and it's just <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Nokri (Marisa): japanese fans do that too it's not just an american thing
but japanese humor is a bit different so the jokes hit a little closer to canon
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ahhh yeah that makes sense
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Idk why I just was thinking about that, sometimes I introduce my friends to something I like alot and then I'm like, wait no.. that's mine
Bill: Marisa would probably appreciate Joseph's taste in manga.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's really dumb but <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): what kinda manga does it include 👀
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He only reads kodomo no jikan
Nokri (Marisa): nOOO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): No I have no idea xD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Who's joeseph <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Andrew: Legendary joseph
Nokri (Marisa): joseph joestar
Nokri (Marisa): what manga does he read
Nokri (Marisa): i gotta know now
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yesss
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He's beautiful
Bill: I don't even remember. The one recommendation he gave me was a fucked up alice in wonderland parody.
Bill: Which I don't remember the title of either.
Bill: Haven't talked to Joseph in years.
Nokri (Marisa): alice in murderland? or one of the alice in wonderland yaois?
Bill: Not yoai. Psychological horror battle manga.
Nokri (Marisa): o yeah alice in murderland
Nokri (Marisa): it's kind of like the promised neverland
Nokri (Marisa): that and btooom
Bill: Nope I don't think that was it.
Nokri (Marisa): ***oh no i failed***
Bill: The main girl was like abused at home, short hair... then her and bunch of others get warped into a battle arena or something.
Bill: It was dark stuff.
Nokri (Marisa): there are so many manga like that <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): one that updated today was pretty decent
Nokri (Marisa): The Monster Duchess and Contract Princess
i'd like to see that update
Nokri (Marisa): best japanese manga that i'm waiting for to update outside of my usual favorites is uhhhh
the white cat sleeping on the dragon prince's lap plots her revenge
or something like that
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): oh and this one too. it's literally katarina but if she *embraced* being a villainess instead of fighting against it
Nokri (Marisa): there's another one with the same premise but the girl goes after the hidden boss demon prince that's also pretty good
Nokri (Marisa): this one just straight up sucks the girl is way too OP
Bill: I'm scrolling back into 2015 to see if I can find the title for oyu.
Nokri (Marisa): paula would make me play a game in japan where whenever we went to a bookstore/anime shop, she'd point at a random manga and make me tell her what it was about. it was fun.
Nokri (Marisa): yes pwease <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Bill: I may have to bail though, cause according to messages I talked to Joseph about Kellner at one point and no fucking thansk.
Nokri (Marisa): no pwessure
Andrew: yea none of that
Andrew: *i still have one volume of raw japanese yona on my shelf*
Nokri (Marisa): this one's korean but it's not too bad. recent chapters are a little slow though
Nokri (Marisa): ***yona***
Nokri (Marisa): i have around three shelves of raw japanese manga now
Andrew: i have one shelf
Nokri (Marisa): oh what's that series about the girl who runs a cleaning store. that one is good and somewhat popular.
Andrew: and the only one i read was mahou shoujo site
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have like... 2 mangos
Nokri (Marisa): this one yee
Nokri (Marisa): jess that's very healthy
Nokri (Marisa): lots of vitamins in mangos
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Andrew: a mango a day
Nokri (Marisa): of my japanese manga, i think 4 are signed? or 5? i know some of them are.
Bill: Not sure if that was like, an after thought for Sarah or...
Bill: Man, I miss Joseph.
Bill: Shame work and lonliness ate him in Seattle.
Andrew: the ol gang
Andrew: we may see josh at next
Andrew: and i see gabbi at works he is local
Nokri (Marisa): it's mostly recently stuff like the school festival arc of hero academia, most recent made in abyss, cells at work, uhhhhh. suijin no ikenie that's a good one that the english is really far behind on, and kimi to wonderland and takane to hana. basically all the hanayume stuff that i had to catch up on because the english scans were so far behind. and randomly, natsume yuujincho
Andrew: Ive thought about contacting him again
Andrew: *i have 3 volumes of vanguard because free cards and the japanese promos were better*
Bill: ooooh. OOOOHHH
Bill: Did... I talk to Joseph about Kellner when he, Sarah and I stayed up till 11am after a party talking in the living room?
Bill: That would make sense.
Bill: I'm not going to find it Mawisa...
Bill: I'm sad now. Joseph was a good friend, scrolling back just making it... so obvious how the distance forced us apart.
Bill: He even said 'I'm moving but I still want to be friends!' and I said the same but...
Bill: It just didn't happen.
Andrew: its hard.
Nokri (Marisa): its hard
Bill: yeah.
Bill: He uh. was pretty depressed. I'm a lot more familiar with the concept now so...
Bill: You'd have got along Mawisa.
Nokri (Marisa): is it the depression :3c
Bill: Nah, I just think you would have.
Bill: ~~i mean, yes, but~~
Bill: more than that.
Andrew: Joseph was a great guy
Nokri (Marisa): y'all talk about him like he's dead
Bill: Of course, you didn't open up beyond weeb stuff still I started Aurii Mawisa, so... 😛
Andrew: is*
Bill: Well, unless I were to invite him here (a little abrupt even if I was close to him), I highly doubt you'll get the chance to talk to him Mawisa. Hence the past tense.
Bill: It's a missed opportunity.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What opportunity did mawisa miss now?
Bill: to be friends with Joseph when we were all back in college.
Bill: pfft. Tho. He was as difficult to get to know as you Mawisa.
Bill: Just as worth it.
Bill: But you kinda had to push friendship on him at first.
Andrew: I wish i had made more effort to know people in college
Andrew: *Joseph and marisa included
Andrew: Im very glad I met Bill, its thanks to him I met all you guys
Bill: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: One useful thing I've done.
Andrew: It still bothers me how it ended with Josh and I
Bill: That's understandable...
Andrew: Justin was whatever
Andrew: but Josh I never got a  chance to talk about our friendship.
Bill: You put more into the friendship than he did. It was all High School DxD to Josh...
Bill: It's a shame when there's a disconnect like that.
Bill: And him not willing to step up a notch is going to hurt.
Bill: You better off tho.
Andrew: All he ever said was "its fine" the whole year
Andrew: So i just stopped trying by the end of the year.
Bill: Your time and friendship are invaluable, and directing them at someone who doesn't appreciate either isn't worth it.
Bill: At least to a point I guess.
Bill: *Technically* you should get your emotional, friendship, and romantic advice from someone other than me here lol, I'm a wreck these days.
Bill: Don't imitate me Andoru-kun!
Andrew: Ive moved on it just will always linger in the back of my mind.
Bill: 😭
Andrew: Now im just disconnected from most of weiss friends b/c its waaay to much weeb for me.
Bill: lolol
Bill: Yeaaaaah it happens.
Andrew: John and Ron included, although aaron not as much
Andrew: With my bad job situation life is hitting too hard for me
Andrew: *John keeps baiting me to buy useless weeb stuff*
Bill: Well... think of it this way; your maturing. The guys dumping all their time, money, and energy into card games or fighting games are missing out on parts of life because they don't see past the next game. That's not wrong, but you're starting to see the world in a bigger picture. See that there's more to people and the world than weeb.
Bill: They'll be jealous of you before too long.
Nokri (Marisa): Andru we were in the same Japanese class for 32 years
Andrew: My was it that long
Bill: It was if Justin had to write the date.
Bill: 😈
Bill: And you guys are the best thing to come out of Rowan for me too. 💛
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Fighting games? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: My hobbies are so over the place
Bill: That’s good tbh.
Andrew: Yea but its a jack of all trades master of none scenario
Andrew: I feel like i never get deep into much
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mood
Bill: You don’t need to be a master at things. Being well rounded is better.
Bill: No one is impressed when I can say I’m a living encyclopedia of anime.
Andrew: *Except Halo wars 2. I have 1k+ hours in and am top 100 globally*
Andrew: I am.
Bill: Gay!
Bill: ❤️
Andrew: ❤
Bill: Marisa has me beat any.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also mood
Andrew: I am glad to still be doing better and better cosplays.
Bill: yeah, you coming from no where with Shield Hero.
Bill: ngl I didn't know you had it in you.
Bill: I'm very impressed.
Nokri (Marisa): Is the one thing I’m semi decent at. I will fight for anime knowledge champion.
Bill: You already defeated me!
