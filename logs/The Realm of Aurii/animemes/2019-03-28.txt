N🆗ri (Marisa): ye maybe i can finish medli by animenext if i can find someone with a wood saw
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG he's buying face masks MA BOI
Aldus Larian (Jess): Someone should tell Ray that Zen raided his closet
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unless cheritz is just on a pink shirt kick latley
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): New update?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen bday event!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OooOOooOooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): what up with cheritz and white hair pink clothes
Aldus Larian (Jess): New trend
N🆗ri (Marisa): zen's like "after the horrors they put me through on my last birthday, i'm going home to relax"
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): #selfcare
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why he wearing a hat?
N🆗ri (Marisa): so the fangirls don't catch him <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen show yourself to the MCs who are your true fangirls
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🚫
Aldus Larian (Jess): See he should worn a hat then
Aldus Larian (Jess): WAIT zen doesn't get a with MC cg for his bday waaaaat
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jumin jaehee and yoosung did
N🆗ri (Marisa): mc is at the cash register waiting for him to stop beauty shopping
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe that's MC in the background 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): she has to be in disguise too
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can't believe dis
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen and V don't get MC for their bday 😭
Bill: ~~V never get MC~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like the idea of V being ace it's backed up by their lack of intimate CGs 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's a solid theory girl I'm telling u
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe he's getting face masks for himself and MC so they can have a romantic self care birthday inside
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like this is the most intimate I think?
Aldus Larian (Jess): But like full clothes, only cuddles no kissy, and he doesn't have a kiss one with Rika either
Aldus Larian (Jess): SPA NIGHT BDAY
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cute
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Holding hands is practically having sex
Aldus Larian (Jess): But yeah V gives me big ace energy
Aldus Larian (Jess): I gotta find the VN where Rika asks him why he never tries to get her in bed
N🆗ri (Marisa): because that's immoral and he's a man of the church
Aldus Larian (Jess): At this point I'd be disappointed if they tell me he's not ace 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): All the other Bois are like "ayyy MC me and you <:pew:543202259085950996> <:lenny:395307171539189760> "
And v is just like "let's just like hold hands"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jaehee has a more intimate cg then v yo
N🆗ri (Marisa): jaehee has a kiss cg
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA on the check but still
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo there's 2 with him and Rika in bed
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cheritz plz we have like 900 images of v and Rika and like 2 with MC
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Opps in prob should have spoiler tagged that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've already seen them
N🆗ri (Marisa): it looks like he's gonna pluck her hair out and run away giggling
Bill: Who is playing the game and hasn’t spoiled everything tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's from rikas behind story that Marisa hasn't played yet

N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a major spoiler <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): basically, characters are space rocks and ||steven is the reincarnation of his mother who was one of the 4 dictators of space rock planet. he's half human though so they thought that by pulling his gem out of him, pink diamond would come back and be her old self. but pink diamond is gone and it's just steven now, and his gem self and his "weak" human self both make up who he is so that was them fusing back together into a whole person||
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Who are they watching? 😮

Aldus Larian (Jess): 😮
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant believe ray asked marisa out and she said no
N🆗ri (Marisa): He jokingly said he wished I was raped by a clown so I was like “nah bro”
N🆗ri (Marisa): If not for that probably woulda accepted
Aldus Larian (Jess): WUYIDBA
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO
Aldus Larian (Jess): #notmyray
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NEETO
Aldus Larian (Jess): right wtf
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He sensed Marisa's inner furry
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s the pickup line to get all the ladies
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's locked away like the fox dekin in naruto
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m not a furry tho <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Only the first seal was opened by a sage
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So only some of the furry power comes out
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): Explains why I’m so ripped and sometimes grow whiskers
Aldus Larian (Jess): stronk
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wonder if well get rays AE before like the end of the year
Aldus Larian (Jess): cheritz, give me the ending for ~~my~~ rays birthday
N🆗ri (Marisa): Before the end of the century
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hope they get him therapy, boi needs therapy
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hope seven and v are ok. WHAT IF VANDERWOOD DIES
N🆗ri (Marisa): He doesn’t need therapy that’s why MC is there
N🆗ri (Marisa): VANDY NO
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe MC was a therapist the whole time
Aldus Larian (Jess): so many of these characters need therapy and not just mc but especially saeran
N🆗ri (Marisa): New therapy DLC
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes gonna go out into the world and be like "wait people are supposed to get PAID to work?!"
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jaehee gives him a pat on the back
Aldus Larian (Jess): "I get a lunch break?!"
"like with FOOD?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s like “ok hold on I gotta prepare myself” and they’re like “for taco tuesday??”
Aldus Larian (Jess): also like DID just doesnt go away and he obviously has ptsd. plz cheritz give my boi therapy
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg plz give my boi tacos
Aldus Larian (Jess): tacos and therapy and his brother plz
N🆗ri (Marisa): Therapy and tacos DLC
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes
N🆗ri (Marisa): Schrodinger’s 707
Aldus Larian (Jess): THEY CAN SING THE TACO SONG TOGETHER
Aldus Larian (Jess): WITH JAEHEE
Aldus Larian (Jess): what if saeran starts working for jumin full time and then anytime jaehee complains about working conditions hes just like <:huh:555585958146473984>
N🆗ri (Marisa): “This is great why are you complaining”
Aldus Larian (Jess): "this is nothing back in ~~my day~~ mint eye i didnt sleep for a whole month"
Aldus Larian (Jess): i still find it hilarious that every single person i offered a job by jumin at somepoint
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd rather work for Jumin than here
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): but jumin has people work like 90 hr shifts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): shit you right
Aldus Larian (Jess): just be like "my cat needs to be fed every 9 hours so i ahve to go home and hell be like "mood"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): now if I was Elizabeth the 3rd's personal cat-sitter...
N🆗ri (Marisa): He wouldn’t trust anyone to be a cat sitter except Jaehee and V and even Jaehee is on a slippery slope
Aldus Larian (Jess): and maybe his own MC
Aldus Larian (Jess): *maybe* XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): When he gave Lisa to Yoosung he made a list of possible owners, and Zen, 707, and MC were on the “not suitable” list
YEAH *maybe*
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg yea you're right!
Aldus Larian (Jess): he trusts jaehee with everything i kinda shipped them at first but then i was like OOF NVM
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jaehee would ship herself as far away as possible
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): i ship her with zen tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): except when playing Zen's route then it's like JAEHEE STAHP GO AWAY
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye I’m surprised more people don’t do that. I can see how she’s just a big fan but people ship Yoosung and the Choi twins more than Jaehee and Zen
Aldus Larian (Jess): she doesnt want his image runiedddd
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA chois and yoosung are so popular
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I honestly don't ship Zen/Jaehee. Jaehee obviously likes him, but I don't think he reciprocates at all... at least in the three routes I've played
Aldus Larian (Jess): I didnt until i played jaehees route
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t think Jaehee romantically likes him. Just mega platonically
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i dont think so either but i think they'd make a good couple
Aldus Larian (Jess): power couple
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *mega platonically saves spicy photos of him*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Platonically watches shirtless videos of him in her rare time off
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s friendship
Aldus Larian (Jess): I saw someone ship saeran and rika and i was like NOPENOPENOPE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *the couple that force feeds elixir to each other, stays together*
N🆗ri (Marisa): abandon ship
N🆗ri (Marisa): they've also got the whole motherly/older sibling relationship going on
Aldus Larian (Jess): like as much as they fucked up V and Rika are still Seven and Searans "parental figures" so NOOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): somone asked toma nd biru for a pic of them at zenkai and biru asked me if its a ship and i was like "god i hope not"
N🆗ri (Marisa): also ray wasn't always trapped at mint eye. he was working 24/7 but he was like the second in command and everyone called him "Mr Ray" and followed his orders
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea hes like the prince of mint eye or whatever
Bill: The real question is why would they want a picture of me <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ray/searan can do whatever he wants and aslong as rika says it ok it seems? hes def second in command
N🆗ri (Marisa): because good V cosplay!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): all the other believers seem terrified of him too
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!!
Bill: Oof no tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): he doesnt have to wear the robes either
Aldus Larian (Jess): but rika did pick his magenta suit for him
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~is danmachi still popular. there's a hestia costume on sale and i have everything for it.~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): boi probably doesn't have any fashion sense
Aldus Larian (Jess): he says "savior picked this for me because she said id dress myself in all dark colors otherwise"
N🆗ri (Marisa): ray and saeran arguing in his head what to wear like yami and yugi
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~and wowie was she right~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): all these chains and leather? that's 100% yugi. yami wakes up in yugi's body and is like "what is *wrong* with this kid's fashion sense"
Aldus Larian (Jess): there was a meme that was like a girl trying to pick a pink dress or like a goth girl outfit and it was captioned "my two personalities trying to pick an outfit" and thats just him
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats such a mood tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): "am i gonna be cute or an edgelord?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): both. both is good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wonder is searan is allowed to leave mint eye? int he main story obviously he is but like in another story
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://media3.giphy.com/media/sRFCEElJhl66snaQag/giphy.gif
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh that me after meetings
N🆗ri (Marisa): he goes to pick MC up i think? or did he send a driver? 
maybe he's allowed to go out but then gets too busy
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone else brings you to mint eye, but i think he comes and get u himself in the bad prologue end of another story? idk
Aldus Larian (Jess): can he drive?!
N🆗ri (Marisa): jumin and saeran driving lessons
Aldus Larian (Jess): so many questions
Aldus Larian (Jess): sevens driving school, please bring your own car
N🆗ri (Marisa): doesn't korea have mandatory military service? or no? are all the characters veterans
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think they do
N🆗ri (Marisa): he turns you away if your car is too uncoll
N🆗ri (Marisa): military jaehee
Aldus Larian (Jess): but seven and saeran dont "exist" right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooooooo true <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): jumin's dad probably could've paid to get him out of it
N🆗ri (Marisa): as could V's
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): zen and yoosung maybe tho?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~zen wouldn't want to go it would ruin his face~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): yoosung just cried and they told him to go
Bill: Second season for promised never land.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA tol posted that this morning

N🆗ri (Marisa): this vampire series might be boy's love. it's hard to tell, it's not tagged with shounen-ai though. it's also not tagged with gender bender. it's tagged with smut though, despite being published in nakayoshi magazine which is for 10 year old girls who ever tagged this manga is a mess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nO JESS NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's an acronym it stands for weekly mint eye Orville Redenbacher Group Yum
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Don't worry Ray doesn't go he's far to busy~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~he also like hates his body and thinks he's hideous so doesn't seem like something he'd do~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): But rikas horny on main

N🆗ri (Marisa): gender benders are my jam. that one chapter it all builds up to with the incredibly awkward reveal 👌 good stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): mint eye starts using ray as its poster boy to get new recruits
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA and he's like "this is terrible marketing"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then they get an influx of new recruits and he's like <:huh:555585958146473984>
Aldus Larian (Jess): "must be a fluke"
N🆗ri (Marisa): all the food and flowers he brings MC are just stuff he finds laying around from his admirers
N🆗ri (Marisa): "wow. MC will sure love this convenient bouquet i found on my pillow."
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): They get out of mint eye and he's like "mc I don't know where to get you gifts anymore"
N🆗ri (Marisa): "the chocolates and flowers stopped spawning"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "they used to just show up at my door"
Aldus Larian (Jess): "Sae those were prob gifts from people that thought you were cute"
"NAH MC quit playing that's ridiculous"
N🆗ri (Marisa): sae bae
Aldus Larian (Jess): Baeran plz
N🆗ri (Marisa): "*are you implying you left me gifts and i gave them back to you*"
"no that's not what i-"
