I'd say noragami is pretty highly rated, the hiatus made its popularity sink but the ratings are still pretty high, it got two seasons and continues to churn out merchandise
kabaneri is also pretty highly rated, it's not as popular as noragami but i've never really seen critique for it, only praise
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i'm not debasing your opinion or really starting a fight i'm just saying what i think pls don't take offense i could be very wrong~~
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): NO CMON LETS FIGHT
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): ðŸ¤›
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): yeah its hard to find anime tahts underrated, id agree, but most people i talk to havent watched kabenari or noragami

Nokri (Marisa): You need to talk to more weeks
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): i should watch wolf children <:thinku:543194478614413318>
