N🆗ri (Marisa): aww man. kosmic moved all their comics to patreon. which makes sense because they have so many comics and they're doing them for free and it takes up a lot of time. good for them. but i was wondering why their websites hadn't updated in a month. ;u;

Bill: Weren’t you excited about shield hero? Marisa?
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH

Bill: Cause blogs are just bashing it for being “I went to fantasy world and bought a slave waifu”. :Lenny ny:
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m gonna fight them
N🆗ri (Marisa): Was raphtalia bought? I can’t remember. Probably. But the main character was one of the “chosen heroes” and then the princess accused him of rape and the rest of the heroes threw him out of the castle and his life sucks
N🆗ri (Marisa): All the other heroes SUCK
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): i love her

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo you read manga or something?
Dirty Lego (Tom): Nooope
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): o
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is good
Read manga and light novel
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what it about?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Four guys get summoned to another world to be the magical heroes that save the world from “waves” of monsters that keep showing up
The sword, bow, and... spear? I think. Those heroes are video game fanatics and try to apply various video game logic to real life, which doesn’t work. Naofumi is the shield hero and tries to get everyone to cooperate and think realistically. 

Everybody turns against Naofumi because they think the shield is useless and basically exile him from the castle with his name dragged through the mud. No one wants to associate with him, so he has to build himself up from 0. That’s why he gets Raphtalia and later Firo. 

Things turn around later, especially when the queen returns, but the beginning has a lot of Suffering for naofumi
Bill: According to episode review, he buy Raphtalia at slave market, has her be his melee combatant, even though she has an aversion to monsters and blood cause monsters killed her parents!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
