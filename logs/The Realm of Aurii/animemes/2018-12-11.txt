秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): omg i helped organize an event like that once, but the event itself was held at the same time as an AP exam so i couldn't go. another girl in my class who would miss school due to migranes a lot was in the same club and same class. she missed the AP exam so we figured she left early due to medical stuff. after the test I ran to the event (it was over sadly but i was helping clean up) and she was there hugging a kitten

her parents were soooo furious that she skipped the test to pet animals because they had to pay $100 for the test
