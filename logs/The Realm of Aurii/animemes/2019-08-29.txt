ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Yesss
Nokri (Marisa): a few of the artists who worked on Enter the Florpus are on twitter talking about their experiences, and one of the background artists is talking about how she got hired. they asked her to draw two locations based on paragraph descriptions of them, and then they gave her a picture of dib's room and said to "draw it fisheyed and covered in pudding"
i wonder if any of the applicants knew that the pudding would be relevant or if they thought it was just part of the random aesthetic
Nokri (Marisa): wow you can really see what a labor of love the movie was
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao that's amazing

Nokri (Marisa): yeah!! sailor uranus and sailor neptune were lovers in the original
Nokri (Marisa): no the incest is the US version
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I watched the original dubs a few years ago. I just don't remember that O.o
Nokri (Marisa): they made them cousins instead of lovers in the US release to explain how close they were, but that just made it weird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): forgot about that
Nokri (Marisa): *really really close cousins*
Nokri (Marisa): the japanese is more normal because they're not related they're just dating
