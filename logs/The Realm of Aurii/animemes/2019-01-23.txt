NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): how is osomatsu-san even legal to air on tv
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): i just remembered the time i was sitting in a dorm common room when some girls came up and asked to use the TV and they put on osomatsu-san, and it was the mad max-based episode where the people in the desert had no lotion and it got weird and it was fun seeing the reactions of people who had no idea what was going on
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): that show gets away with a lot of butt stuff. a lot of very scary stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What's osomatsusan?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is that the skeleton anime?
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): it was INSANELY popular in 2016. everything in japan was osomatsu-san themed. literally everything.
naw it's the one about the sextuplets
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): guys had kemono friends and girls had osomatsu-san
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ğŸ¤¯
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): the first episode was banned because it parodied so many other anime that all the other animation studios threatened to sue. it was amazing.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): it's funny but don't watch it in public because it gets weird and lewd fast
Bill: ~~kemono Friends is nothing like that though~~
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah but they were the big populars
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): kemono friends led to the rise in more 3d cgi anime
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): like houseki no kuni
Bill: Oh ye both popular. Just not the same kind of show.
Bill: Kemono friends be garbage. Waifus everywhere.

NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): he was a penguin at a zoo where they did a collab with kemono friends and put furry waifu cardboard cutouts in every exhibit

Bill: His love is pure and wholesome.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa):
