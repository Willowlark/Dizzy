NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Twice toll tales. So toll.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I got the book <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
I knew it was gonna be good but at a glance itâ€™s a lot more than I thought. Itâ€™s actually textbook sized, has color pictures and infographics, timelines, and discusses how non-anime otaku categories also play into the spread of anime. The sources also have Youtube URLs to videos Iâ€™m gonna look up.
Even has helpful history stuff about the use of 3D animation which I was gonna include in the presentation but i didnâ€™t realize how far back it was being used
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Much better than the otaku database animals book and even mechademia which are just kind of word splurges with the occasional black and white photo
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): And fancy page boarders that just take up space
Bill: Worth the bank?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Yee itâ€™s better than textbooks Iâ€™ve bought in the past. Pricy but quality. I have some other books by this guy and his associates that I got super cheap, which were essentially catalogues and lists of famous anime with a short blurb about them so it wasnâ€™t anything special. But this is neat
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Itâ€™s a little outdated (2013) and somewhat biased but what book isnâ€™t
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 250 pages total, thereâ€™s a whole chapter on what I could only find a paragraph about online <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo nice!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WE FINALLY WATCHED GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES MARISA
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It was awful!
