Nokri (Marisa): fireworks one is very relatable i feel it
Aldus (Jess): That happens to alot of ppl for real
Aldus (Jess): "you should probably just assume it's a bomb"
Nokri (Marisa): i went to a fireworks show last week and they started shooting off test fireworks while the sun was still up and my first thought was "omg is someone shooting people"
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Nuuuuuu
Nokri (Marisa): the fun game everybody loves!
Aldus (Jess): Eternal Vacation yaaaaay!
Aldus (Jess): Sounds good to me man idk I'm signing ip
Nokri (Marisa): woooooo
Nokri (Marisa): i wonder if mint eye will eventually be one of those cults that kills everyone off 🤔
Aldus (Jess): Gotta log into my computer so I can view these goods in full quality
Nokri (Marisa): didn't like most of mint eye die in V's route
Aldus (Jess): Nah the evacuated
Aldus (Jess): SEPT RAY
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Aldus (Jess): Pretty sure Rika lived and ray died and that's so sad ~~707, play despasito~~
Nokri (Marisa): omg that reminds me that lashinbang has a violin replica for sale in their used cosplay section and i was lowkey considering buying it ~~despite already having an actual violin~~
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): it's a nice fake violin hhh
Aldus (Jess): oooo!
Aldus (Jess): how much tho?
Nokri (Marisa): $65 that's the main reason I didn't get it. it looks really real tho i'm wondering what the difference is between replica and real. even has the bow and everything
Aldus (Jess): WHOA the new MM merch is already sold out
Nokri (Marisa): OH it's not on sale yet!! that's why it says sold out hehe
Nokri (Marisa): they'll start selling it otakon
Aldus (Jess): OOO OK
Aldus (Jess): how can they give me body pillow of both the white haired bois??? how am i supposed to make that choice?!
Nokri (Marisa): and they're the most expensive ones hhhh
2 for 1 with unknown <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): TRUE
Aldus (Jess): ALSO HE SMILE
Aldus (Jess): PRECIOUS
Nokri (Marisa): ooo it's listed officially as Ray and Unknown?
idk which of this boys personalities are on the pillow i thought it was another. boy got too many personalities
Aldus (Jess): yeee its listed as ray and unknown
Nokri (Marisa): [mc voice] unknown ur fly is down
Aldus (Jess): "yea thats kinda the point mc"
Nokri (Marisa): "dude xyz"
Aldus (Jess): the white outfit is his end route look though yea?
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): marisa plz this isnt a spoiler
Nokri (Marisa): ye that's basically his final form
Aldus (Jess): Im assuming her goes by his actual name at the end?
Nokri (Marisa): :3c
Nokri (Marisa): i think his final form's personality from another story is pretty different from how he ends up in the secret ending
Aldus (Jess): or maybe not cuz he still trying to hide his identity from daddy right?
Aldus (Jess): YEA cuz in his ending HE gets the girl not his brother
Aldus (Jess): whooo
Aldus (Jess): "bro i found this girl and you totally took her from me fuck you"
Nokri (Marisa): "even though we're twins i'm not sharing"
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): mc is lie "bois plz we can settle this"
Nokri (Marisa): the twins have the most outfits by far out of anyone. seven with his cosplays and saeran with his personalities own fashion styles
Aldus (Jess): WHY ARE THE BODY PILLOWS $100  😭
Aldus (Jess): FASHION TWINS
Nokri (Marisa): time to compile a list of outfits because there's no better way to spend time
Aldus (Jess): OO have you seen 707s concept art?
Aldus (Jess): like his outfits i like the no shoulders one
Nokri (Marisa): yee it reminds me of yellow guy from pokemon go
Nokri (Marisa): hmm. do casual t-shirts and stuff count as outfits because zen takes a lot of selfies so he may have more outfits than i recalled.
Aldus (Jess): OH YEA
Aldus (Jess): plus costumes from his musicals
Nokri (Marisa): yeah 😭 zen also fair contender darn
Aldus (Jess): i had a feeling the secret bodyypillow would be zen cuz like i feel only he would wear an ancklet
Nokri (Marisa): tacky zen
Aldus (Jess): or maybe yoosung cuz he wear hairclips and pins already
Nokri (Marisa): looking through the galleries, all the characters are pretty good with not wearing the same clothes. all their cgi clothes are diffrent. drat.
Aldus (Jess): hmmm true jumin changed suits like 3 times a day in his route
Aldus (Jess): maybe that was his excuse to go home so often on his route - he just kept dumping coffee on his cloths
Nokri (Marisa): "mc u gotta stay i have more laundry u need to clean"
Nokri (Marisa): unknown has the most outfits that actually show up in the story, in front of MC. everyone else's outfits are usually through pictures they send ~~except jumin maybe~~
Aldus (Jess): v has lie litteraly 3
Nokri (Marisa): blind to fashion
Bill: ~~It’s because~~
Nokri (Marisa): jumin needs to stop wearing white suits it doesn't *suit* him
Bill: ~~no one loves V~~
Aldus (Jess): o tru
Aldus (Jess): NO
Nokri (Marisa): rika used to <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): and still might? in a murdery kind of way
Nokri (Marisa): she flipped out pretty badly after shooting him
Aldus (Jess): ~~she still banking on that threesome~~
Nokri (Marisa): biru when are you gonna cosplay v
Aldus (Jess): i just realsied zens bathing suit says zen on it
Nokri (Marisa): DO CULT V
Nokri (Marisa): zen the narcissist
Aldus (Jess): HOLY BUTTS
Aldus (Jess): thats so good
Bill: I don’t have the minimum sexiness requirements to do anything mystic messenger.
Nokri (Marisa): u can borrow my sinon wig that's kind of close to v's hair color maybe
Aldus (Jess): hmmm in the ray/unknown body pillow, boi's crotch lookin a lil bigger in one than the other
Nokri (Marisa): it's because his fly is down and he needs to fix his pants
Aldus (Jess): oh yea that makes sence
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): biru cosplay v so you can recover his 6 months of lost dignity
Aldus (Jess): OMG XD
Bill: meh.
Aldus (Jess): *buys all the MM emoki pillow and puts them all on the couch in the living room*
Nokri (Marisa): u have the same watchful eye about suspicious scams
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): jess sign up for that mtv cribs show and just fill your house with mystic messenger
Bill: Even if I were to go and do a V cosplay...

You'd just ignore it complete for Tom as Unknown because *ya'll don't love V*.
Aldus (Jess): NA UH
Nokri (Marisa): "hey mtv welcome to my crib"
Aldus (Jess): ~~toms unknown is on point tho ok~~
Bill: ~~100%, no question there~~
Nokri (Marisa): we can do shoots of ray sobbing and v standing awkwardly regretting his life decisions
Aldus (Jess): YEA!
Aldus (Jess): WHOO
Nokri (Marisa): "don't touch me this is gucci"
Aldus (Jess): LMFAO
Aldus (Jess): whats he trying to give himm??
Nokri (Marisa): :3c
Aldus (Jess): "here my business card"
Nokri (Marisa): "u need help, call me. though sometimes i have "bad phone service" because of reasons."
Aldus (Jess): "if you ever idk want me to take pictured of you crying or something"
Aldus (Jess): "hey kid wanna join ANOTHER cult?"
Nokri (Marisa): biru if you cosplay V you have an excuse to decline photoshoots if people call you at the con. "sorry i have a bad connection kkshssss you're ksssshsss breaking up"
Aldus (Jess): and type it out in messages too
Aldus (Jess): like
Aldus (Jess): ioiidiof
Aldus (Jess): nnd
Aldus (Jess): opps i have bad service
Bill: Throwback to Jess in V's route

"Oh, um, yes V is so wonderful... but have *you seen Ray?*"
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i wonder if vanderwood will make a summer appearance. probably not because he's a spoiler but we can wish.
Nokri (Marisa): ray's route has such good music
Aldus (Jess): OK THATS CUZ RAY IS SOOOO SWEET like makes you breakfast and brings you flowers
Bill: *V, Unloved*
Aldus (Jess): SO HARD TO NOT LOVE RAY
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH MEANWHILE V DISAPPEARS FOR TWO YEARS AND SPENDS MOST OF HIS ROUTE CHASING HIS EX
Aldus (Jess): ooo but when he tld rika they were over that was good stuff
Bill: ~~maybe that's because MC went off trying to fuck Ray and he gave up on life~~
Aldus (Jess): AND WHEN JUMIN WAS LIKE "bitch imma defend my ~~boyfriend~~ best friend"
Nokri (Marisa): you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
Aldus (Jess): juminxv good ship
Aldus (Jess): there it is, the most holy of cgs
Nokri (Marisa): ray sings for you. he serenade you. ~~he also abuses you but it's fine it's just a phase.~~
Aldus (Jess): its ok its not realy him
Nokri (Marisa): ^
Aldus (Jess): someone get this boy therapy plz
Nokri (Marisa): i think he sings multiple times, he sings in another route as unknown too
Nokri (Marisa): and jaehee sings. and seven sings a jingle I think? does anyone else?
Aldus (Jess): zen? maybe
Aldus (Jess): i mean thats his friggen job so
Nokri (Marisa): mystic mess music cd when
Bill: meanwhile V is a good boi.
Bill: silly girls and their bad boys.
Nokri (Marisa): meanwhile V inadvertently causes a cult to be created <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): everything is V's fault without him MM wouldn't happen :3c
Aldus (Jess): HA hahaha Vs art of the reason saeran is the way he is tho
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): V MESSED OUR BOI UP
Aldus (Jess): its more rika BUT STILL
Nokri (Marisa): and he's barely even present in 90% of the routes
Aldus (Jess): v tries to fix everything on his owna dn just fucks up everything
Nokri (Marisa): the cast literally has to tell him "stop it v you're making everything worse with the secrets"
Aldus (Jess): literally doesnt tell seven that ray is his brother, means seven can never save him and he dies
Bill: ~~he has to do it on his own because **you don't love him**~~
Nokri (Marisa): v killed a boi
Nokri (Marisa): the face of murder
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/6/61/V_Emoji1.gif/revision/latest?cb=20170910153828
Aldus (Jess): i mean lets be honest V and 707's routs are both an uphill battle
Nokri (Marisa): ~~just wait until u hit ray's route yehaw~~
Aldus (Jess): AWWW YEEEE
Aldus (Jess): ~~but he got that sweet goth aesthetic itll be ok~~
Nokri (Marisa): them eye bags. hot.
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): youd be tired too if you hav 3 hours of sleep and 2 personalities
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): i heard that some people with DID dont sleep but still feel re-energized when switching personalities
Nokri (Marisa): orly? that's pretty neat
Bill: Jess hasn't finished ray route yet right?
Nokri (Marisa): time to develop a split personality
Nokri (Marisa): not yet yeah
jess do you play with the sound on
Aldus (Jess): nope
Aldus (Jess): sometimes! not al the time
Bill: I was looking at stills and I was going to share 'good V' 'bad Ray', but don't want to spoil cgs.
Nokri (Marisa): there's one vn part u gotta play with sound it's perf
Nokri (Marisa): pm 'em and i can tell you if they spoilers or not
Aldus (Jess): ~~ive spoiled so much formyself ive prob seen it~~
Nokri (Marisa): if they are we can talk about them in really vague ways to make jess want to finish the route more
Aldus (Jess): i try to play VNs with sound
Bill: not worth that much effort.
Bill: You both know deep down you hate V.
Aldus (Jess): I DONT HATE V
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i hate v's fashion sense~~
Nokri (Marisa): who disappears for 2 years and shows up to a formal party looking like a hippie
Bill: Look into your heart, past the shine to Ray, and you know it to be true.
Bill: MC route when tho, that a cute outfit. I know you've shared it before but still.
Nokri (Marisa): ye now jumin has good fashion sense
Aldus (Jess): jumins fucking stylin
Aldus (Jess): jumin picked that outfit and hair tho so see you really wanna do jumins route
Nokri (Marisa): unknown is like. unknown. sometimes it's good. sometimes what is he even wearin.
Nokri (Marisa): nice outfits for mc tho
Aldus (Jess): ~~he might need those straps for later ok~~
Bill: If you ignore the fact that's probably some kind of domination kink going on. It's a bad end right?
Aldus (Jess): na i think its chirstmas dlc?
Bill: ~~Dizzy, counter jess-kinks add 1~~
Bill: Bad end for the DLC>
Aldus (Jess): ~~everybody says jumin is kinky but saerans the real kink daddy~~
Nokri (Marisa): Ya it’s the secret Christmas dlc. The Christmas one is only 2 days so I think the bad end for that is if you just ignore literally every chat
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): whoo!
Nokri (Marisa): Is it bad if it’s good tho
Aldus (Jess): doesnt he say hes going to make it christmas everyday?
Nokri (Marisa): He sings u Christmas songs and YEAH EVERYDAYWOOOOO
Aldus (Jess): WHOOO
Aldus (Jess): *still has body pillow open in another tab*
Nokri (Marisa): Permanent tab
Nokri (Marisa): was it here i was recently talking about the pillow boy anime?
Bill: yup, kidnaps, uses as dress up doll, reinvents christmas to reward the bad kids.
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): the anime where each episode is like 10 minutes and it's basically, you put your screen on your bed and pretend there's some anime guy laying down next to you while they talk about random stuff
Aldus (Jess): NICE
Nokri (Marisa): and each guy is a giant stereotype. like, the twins, the tsundere, the older guy, the shota, the boy next door
Bill: oof. V's bad ending one, MC is like 'love me, let him go', and she becomes Rika's lesbian lover.

or two, V be like 'you know what, Rika a bitch. I'mma be your dog instead'. Then at some point you... also become a bitch?
Bill: *pfft* Another Story has a report to the police option?
Nokri (Marisa): the thing with v is he gets obsessive, that's why rika turned the way she did. but not like, jumin-locking-you-in-a-cage obsessive. more like "you're absolutely perfect and everything you do is perfect and you are everything in the world."
rika started acting out, trying to get V to reel her back down to earth but instead he was like "you're doing great sweetheart" and couldn't find any flaws with her
Bill: So you mean, the normal response to cults, bombs, and apps that lock you in apartments?
Aldus (Jess): ~~Rika still crazy though~~
Aldus (Jess): you know whos a good character?
Aldus (Jess): Vs mom
Nokri (Marisa): yeee
Aldus (Jess): i liked her
Aldus (Jess): you know hows a dick? v's dad
Nokri (Marisa): rika runs off to start a cult and v's just like "yeah she died. oops." instead of telling the truth
Nokri (Marisa): truu
Aldus (Jess): V and Rika are worst couple evar
Nokri (Marisa): picture perfect on the outside but a flaming mess absolutely
Aldus (Jess): "hey V were a mess but you knwo what we should do? take two boys from an abusive situation under our wing and fuck them up too!"
Aldus (Jess): "wow what a great idea rika!"
Bill: god damn these endings are fucked up.
Aldus (Jess): HELL YEA
Bill: I mean, I knew some of them, but the wikia summaries really drive them dark points home.
Aldus (Jess): ive read most of them
Aldus (Jess): not rays, sept i know vaguely what on of them is
Aldus (Jess): Pokemon the musical
Nokri (Marisa): I wanna be

Nokri (Marisa): V is the photographer 
Jumin is learning photography you could say <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): oh he needs help
Nokri (Marisa): Jumin takes the best pictures
