Elfriede (Tom): I'm sitting next to another unknown at dinner
Nokri (Marisa): Is it a mirror
Elfriede (Tom): Solid mirror
Elfriede (Tom): Quality Kurtis meme
Nokri (Marisa): my Hero
the Mightiest of All
Nokri (Marisa): He‚Äôs hete
Nokri (Marisa): Woah Tom how did you make the mirror pose different from your pose. Was there another mirror in front of you that‚Äôs reflecting back for endless mirrors
Nokri (Marisa): Are you wearing cat ears
Nokri (Marisa): I need to know asking for a friend
Nokri (Marisa): Frilly cat ears
Nokri (Marisa): One thing about not being Asian at a Japanese nerd event is you get a lot of TV and press interviews  help
Nokri (Marisa): jeSS DID YOU SEE WHAT COMES WITH THE RAY/UNKNOWN BODY PILLOWS
Nokri (Marisa): jess is this you
Aldus (Jess): God I wish that we're me
Nokri (Marisa): god seven
Aldus (Jess): What comes with it?! üòÆ
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i feel like this should go in nsfw
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Nokri (Marisa): there was also a jumin thing i think someone got, lemme find it
Aldus (Jess): That's amazing omg. Omg Ray side so cute üò≠
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): I got that!
Nokri (Marisa): JUMIN LOVES YOU
Aldus (Jess): They gave them out at the panel!
Nokri (Marisa): were they all jumin? or were they different?
Aldus (Jess): I got an rfa dosier flyer, a mint eye recruitement flyer and the regular game flyer too but they got kinda beat up cuz I had to out them in my bag
Aldus (Jess): They were all jumin!
Aldus (Jess): At least that's what me and all the girls around me got
Nokri (Marisa): the panel was sponsored by Jumin
Aldus (Jess): Apparently jumins VA was going to cost too much for them to have come here cuz he trvels with an enterouge
Nokri (Marisa): some people got roses too :0
Nokri (Marisa): seriously???
Nokri (Marisa): ?????????????????????????????
Nokri (Marisa): rfa is real
Aldus (Jess): That's what I heard. The cast said he is rich, like irl jumin. Apparently zens va is into himself too like zen, and he improvises his lines alot
Nokri (Marisa): "we couldn't afford to bring Jumin's voice actor here" is the most understandable excuse
omg
Nokri (Marisa): zen's va takin' selfies in the recording studio
Aldus (Jess): They said that zen has the most honest lines in the game since they are mostly from the VA himself and not from the script. They showed recording clips of everyone
Aldus (Jess): Vs voice actor broke down crying while recording more than once
Nokri (Marisa): i saw clips on twitter but not a whole video yET OH NO REALLY
POOR V THAT'S SO SAD
Nokri (Marisa): did they do a live reading?
Nokri (Marisa): ~~sorry i'm being nosy~~
Aldus (Jess): Yea! They did scences from the game and they did a senaroi where the characters come to the con live they had like the "VN section" up in the screen with the subtitles while the VAs talked on stage
Aldus (Jess): ~~plz don't be sorry I wasn't to tell everything~~
Nokri (Marisa): OOOOH that's what that was! i saw like 20 seconds of it on twitter and i was like "omg what's happening"

Aldus (Jess): Whoa! RWBY's in Japan
Nokri (Marisa): *run*
Nokri (Marisa): kerry and a few other rwby creators came to japan a year or so ago! they did a big rwby promotion event
Aldus (Jess): Then like 5 mins later Tom creeped up behind me and just stood there watching me for like 5 mins while I talked to other fans. Very in character
Aldus (Jess): Whoa! That's coo! All the people we're talking about them last week at the rtx
Nokri (Marisa): jumin comes up to you

Nokri (Marisa): they do become the same person ü§î
Nokri (Marisa): quick go ask cheritz while you're still at otakon
Nokri (Marisa): knock on their door "excuse me cheritz"
Aldus (Jess): The VA was like hi I'm ____  and I voice unknown... and ray, ... and saeran
Aldus (Jess): Escuse cheritu I have big questions
Nokri (Marisa): "unknown...... ray...... and saeran......... some of you also know me as pookiebear and snufflekins........ mr. hunk............."
Aldus (Jess): ~~Marshmallow boi... Best boi... Baby boi...~~
Nokri (Marisa): the entire panel is just him listing names
Nokri (Marisa): then he goes "my mother used to call me....." and starts saying all this depressing stuff
Aldus (Jess): They did a section on each character and the charactera va and when they got a jaehee Ray's va was like "well my character and hers have 0 interaction but I love her, jaehee is my dream girl I'm confessing me lone to her right now"
Aldus (Jess): OH NO omg
Aldus (Jess): That would be so terrible
Nokri (Marisa): everyone loves baehee
ray talks with jaehee! in the visual novel! right? a little bit. basically "hi i'm saeran" "hi i'm jaehee, over to you jumin" and that' sit
Nokri (Marisa): i guess ray/jaehee is canon now
Aldus (Jess): Ya that's it üò≠
Aldus (Jess): RIGHT omggg
Nokri (Marisa): raehee
Aldus (Jess): Vs va was like "i ship jumin and jaehee" and the crowds reaction was so mixed I lold
Aldus (Jess): Oh the producer/writer talked about each if the characters too and what she was going for with each of them
Nokri (Marisa): v just doesn't want jumin stealing his cult gf
oooooooo that sounds really cool
Nokri (Marisa): did she create all of them herself?
Aldus (Jess): Yea!
Nokri (Marisa): miss cheritz is amazing
Nokri (Marisa): cheritz route when
Aldus (Jess): I guess cheritz was failing and she started making  mysmess but she stopped for a whole year cuz she felt like a failure and then the fan letters from dandelion fans the thier other game encouraged her to finished the game
Nokri (Marisa): ahhhhh h that's so good. yeah there were very few people especially in the US who knew that dandelion and nameless existed, only super hardcore otome game fans. now they super famous and have cafes and speak to rooms jam packed with people
Nokri (Marisa): did they mention the ssum at all?
Aldus (Jess): Nope <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

Nokri (Marisa): i wonder exactly how many of his lines have rika in them. what percent.
Nokri (Marisa): self aware VAs
Aldus (Jess): Vs voice actor spoke the best English out of all the VAs so he said some lines in English
Nokri (Marisa): what he say?
Nokri (Marisa): trash talking the other VAs in english
Aldus (Jess): They got to Rika character page and the guy was like "does anyone want to say and thing about rika" and he was like "I do! Rika, I hate you" and I think he said I love you? And something else from the scene reanactment beside that he switched from Korean to English the whole time
Aldus (Jess): While signing autographs he pointed to a pic with Rika on it and he was like "she's a very bad girl"
Nokri (Marisa): v that's not nice to say about your fiance
Nokri (Marisa): *maybe he knows what happens in the after ending*

Nokri (Marisa): counter: mystic mess is a priority
Aldus (Jess): Ye plus there were like so many people that couldn't get in so I'd feel bad taking a seat if I wasn't into the game, personally
Aldus (Jess): MM is top priority üëå
Nokri (Marisa): oooooo true, good idea thinking of the fans
Aldus (Jess): It was like halfway over and people were still waiting outside hoping someone would leave
Nokri (Marisa): were people standing in the back too? or did they take the fire code seriously
