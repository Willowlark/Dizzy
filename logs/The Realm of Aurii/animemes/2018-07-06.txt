Nokri (Marisa): i haven't seen the anime but i've read the manga i'm far behind on anime oops

Nokri (Marisa): a good historical manga
Nokri (Marisa): ooooo yeah when translators put the little extra at the end that's 10/10
Bill: oh no, they commented on every page.
Nokri (Marisa): OOOo that one guy
Nokri (Marisa): people got mad at him for doing that to another series because he took it way too far and didn't translate it properly
Nokri (Marisa): they translated the whole thing like this
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i think it's the same person? maybe?
Bill: throwback to when Horriblesubs gave up on translating Hidan no Aria and started putting editor's notes across the entire image for 20 seconds at a time.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: YEAAAAAH like that.
Nokri (Marisa):
