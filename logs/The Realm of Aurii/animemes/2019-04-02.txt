Elfriede Faun (Tom): Maybe I wtached the rest and don't remember
N🆗ri (Marisa): shoot i could've make a whale pun
N🆗ri (Marisa): "whale, that's enough of this anime" - tom
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That whole depressive streak that Subaru went on where he failed over and over and then told rem to to marry him and run away
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is what killed the show for me, not anything in particular, just Subaru was so pathetic <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus Larian (Jess): until you miss a few chatrooms cuz u try to sleep
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just bought them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it would be easier...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ive spent $60 on games I spent less than half the time playing as MM so was worth for me I think it was like $16? So like $8 a route
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): With what I have currently, I'd need to spend $13. But it's still day one, so that'll change throughout the week and a half
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): why is this game frustratingly addictive
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea! As long as you set alarms for all your chatrooms you'll have more.
Bill: she means 'don't sleep'.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean he already implied that's what he was gonna fo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://twitter.com/kuukuns/status/1112392538298695680?s=19

Aldus Larian (Jess): this is so cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): ドキッ！！
Aldus Larian (Jess): wow i wish i knew what that said
Bill: I'd like to meet you?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I want to see you!
slampie. slampai?
Bill: Yeah, it. sounds like senpai but that's a japanese word so why katakana?
Aldus Larian (Jess): what did u write marisa?
Bill: Doki.
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe it's the artist name
N🆗ri (Marisa): wrote it in japanese to keep the aesthetic
Bill: I don't even know man.
N🆗ri (Marisa): どうして？
Bill: Cause it weird.
Bill: Lots of pixiv artists go use romanji so...
N🆗ri (Marisa): english is cool in japanese
japanese is cool in english
equivalent exchange <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: ~~japanese is weeby in english~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ひどい
Bill: yeah. Exactly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): every day i consider asking sensei if she's goin' to sakura sunday and every day i die inside
Aldus Larian (Jess): ask heerrrr
Bill: di it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if i..... didn't
Bill: I'll send her an email, *in english*, doxxing you.
Bill: and then order dominos to your house.
N🆗ri (Marisa): message her! message her!
without doxxing me and pizza!
Bill: Neither of those are happening.
Bill: Seriously, I don't want to message her cause my lack of japanese knowledge is sad.
N🆗ri (Marisa): send one of those 10 hour anime loops out of context
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Now that I know more, having these options makes more sense <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA<:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): saaavioooooooor! ray is saying bad things!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ray:"you can't tell me what to do, you're not my real mom!"
Rika: *gasp*
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's how a boy gets shot
Aldus Larian (Jess): Stabbings more rikas style
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): rika probably has a ridiculous gold ceremonial dagger
Aldus Larian (Jess): You know it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Rika prob gets the most sleep out if all the characters in the game smh
N🆗ri (Marisa): she sleeps soundly knowing she shall crush the rfa
Bill: ~~and the most sleeping around?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): v didn't sleep with her and now she's single tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think V did tho?
Aldus Larian (Jess): But like against his will
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz there's a VN where she's like "V why don't you ever try to sleep with me if you love me?"
And he's like "Rika it's not like that"
And she's basically like "omg v sleep with me!!"
And he's like "ok if that's what you need"
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow rika is truly pure evil
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea she is not coo
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'll try to find it I think it was from vs route
Aldus Larian (Jess): It was really sad yo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or maybe it's in the secret ending?
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe a bad end?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dont think so
Aldus Larian (Jess): It was a flashback of his
Aldus Larian (Jess): Time to replay the entire game!
N🆗ri (Marisa): good idea!! let's go
Aldus Larian (Jess): How tf did I forget that unknown shows up during vs route on day 8 wtf
N🆗ri (Marisa): surprise!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): isn't there a big cg for it and everything
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah I mean in the chatroom
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unless I'm forgetting g something else too
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah maybe no cgs hmm
we really gotta replay
Aldus Larian (Jess): At first It's Ray and then he's like "MC HEs COMmING"
Aldus Larian (Jess): And then Ray leaves the catroom and unknown shows up and MC is like "lol who's this other guy"
N🆗ri (Marisa): so extra
Aldus Larian (Jess): And the seven comes in and is like "whoever tf you are I'm gonna beat you"
And unknown is like "guess you really didn't forget about me" 
And sevens like "I have no time for this I have analyse your attack pattern"
Aldus Larian (Jess): I vaguely remember seven blowing him off and being like NOOoOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~its an 11pm chat maybe I was drunk~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***why would you be drunk***
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz vs route is just that stressful ya know
N🆗ri (Marisa): more stressful with liquor 
bad stuff

Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm sowwy mawisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry you have to apologize
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's the law
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm never gonna find this VN with Rika and V I swear I'm not making it uo
Aldus Larian (Jess): Guess I'll add V to the last of routes to replay
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's just a list of everyone
Aldus Larian (Jess): Kinda ya 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seven, Ray and V are top
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz I enjoy suffering I guess
Aldus Larian (Jess): I played one of the last days Ray's route on the beach so I'm sure I missed stuff
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also I just have a terrible memory
