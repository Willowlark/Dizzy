No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I got here early to buy the pamphlet but apparently I‚Äôm too hate hhh. Or at least for the presale of it? I really really hope I can still buy it. ;~;
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Like maybe after the show? I really hope uguuu I was literally 1 minute late. There‚Äôs a really cute girl here with Yona‚Äôs hair though she looks adorable.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Ok I should be able to after the show ya.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I‚Äôm surprised at the number of guys here. There are a lot. No couples, just groups of teenage girls or adult guys.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): They‚Äôve got guys wandering around welcoming people to Hiryuu castle and asking people where they‚Äôre from I‚Äôm crackin up
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): There‚Äôs so many of them talking at once I can‚Äôt understand a thing anymore lol

SHINAH IS INCREDIBLY AWKWARD AND SUPER UNNECESSAILY DRAMATIC
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it‚Äôs the intermission and the transition into intermission was so dramatic what a cliffhanger
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): It‚Äôs a recap of the anime but some things are different. A little bit. Lines are lifted right from the anime but of course it‚Äôs condensed. The white and blue dragon conquests were done at the same time and the white dragon cult vibe was really good while the blue dragon deniers were super freaky and spot on
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): The girl next to me has tissues and some people have binoculars I should‚Äôve been more prepared
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OH and Ao‚Äôs lines are voiced by Shin-ah going ‚Äúpukkyu‚Äù in a super deep voice

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Taejun is just the right amount of pathetic and his soldiers are spot on. He orders them to persue and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúdude you gotta come with us‚Äù
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OK KNTERMISSION IS ENDING
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Poor Zeno is stabbed like 9/10 times he shows up
The ending was subpar but still really well done with what they had to accomplish. Now they‚Äôre gonna do a short talk show.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Shin-ah straight up murdered a fish
They added to the cross dressing scene. I‚Äôm glad they did it but since they couldn‚Äôt change Kija into girls clothes they added some gags. Yun kisses Kumji on the nose to distract him lol
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): They only had time for two questions because they spent so much time thinking about what to eat
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Kija‚Äôs cape kept getting stuck on the chair owo

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): It starts right with Il‚Äôs murder. Like, first scene. Bam. Suwon is a murderer.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): How far into the manga did you get? Or are you caught up?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I wish it was socially acceptable to talk to strangers because the girl next to me was SO into it. You could tell she was a mega fan girl and that‚Äôs how I met Courtney.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): She brought tissues ready to cry at a Yona play like sign me up for that
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): And binoculars just to zoom in

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Of course Shin-ah is popular and now I understand why
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): The little background interactions were great too, for characters who weren‚Äôt the focus but were still on stage
