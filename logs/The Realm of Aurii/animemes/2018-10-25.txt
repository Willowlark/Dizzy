Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also Sinha is bae <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Total Nok-out (Marisa): there's one arc centered around him that i'm a bit disappointed with because it's really out-there as far as yona is concerned and it's one of the weaker stories *but who cares because shinah*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo really? Later on?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I just went through the in where he went all eye crazy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That was before taejuns arc
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ya later on, it's called the lushing forest arc
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i know it's before chapter 100
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo ok gotcha
Total Nok-out (Marisa): "see ya"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Just gonna go through this hole we cut in this old lady's ceiling
Total Nok-out (Marisa): just passing by don't mind us

Total Nok-out (Marisa): maybe if you opened the door we  wouldn't need to cut holes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh wait that wasn't the old lady that was the other guy uhhh I forget his name god I'm terrible with names
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That old lady thirsty for hak tho
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ~~which old lady thirsty for hak~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh the one they took care of in the village, hai gave her massages an then taejun tried is and the old lady was like "bring back the hot one"
Total Nok-out (Marisa): have you read 59 yet or is that where you left off
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I in da middle
Total Nok-out (Marisa): zeno so pure
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YES
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So happy, talks in third person and isk y but so pure
Total Nok-out (Marisa): she munch
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ao is gurl?!
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ye!! ~~this ao is~~
people were curious so kusanagi mentioned that in a Q&A
Total Nok-out (Marisa): though every time they go to the hotsprings she goes into the men's bath. scandalous.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ommgggg ao ðŸ˜® so brave
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ao is amazing, squirrel ao at least
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ~~pfft forget dragon ao~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): she's the backbone of the happy hungry bunch
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~ohno I was gonna call him daddy ao~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~but that's not good~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ~~it's fine.~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i love the way kusanagi draws really awkward scenes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "hey uhhhh didn't I try to kill you once?"
Total Nok-out (Marisa): "hey buddy..... pal....... can i uh............... mind if i join ya? mind if we have........... a buddy..... fire??"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hak: "I really. Don't. Care." "Wait a min"
Total Nok-out (Marisa): tfw ur waifu approaches
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i like how the relationships with su-won are treated realistically. 
he's the antagonist and did horrible things but he's still a real person and his goals are justifiable, he did it for the betterment of the country. yona and co. might still into him and have to deal with him even if they don't like it.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): OH i'm rereading stuff and I totally forgot there's a good reason zeno calls himself in third person aside from being childish (kids in japan refer to themselves in third person, it's a cutesy thing)
Elfriede (Tom): I like that about suwon as wellðŸ‘Œ
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA me too!
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Suwon begrudging appreciation post
Elfriede (Tom): I kinda like the idea that evil acts exist but evil people do not. Or that no one is born evil.
Elfriede (Tom): And I like when authors play with the idea that no one is the villian.
Elfriede (Tom): Mononoke did it really well
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Yeah!!
Total Nok-out (Marisa): There are evil characters/people in Yona but itâ€™s not Su-won and they have justifiable reasons, itâ€™s not just pure malice for the sake of having an evil character
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Well there was Kum-ji who was evil because capitalism and trading humans but heâ€™s dead now lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Whoo!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My phone's icons have slowly all switched to circles, look like it finally forces MM to be a circoe but the icon is so smoo

Bill: ~~I love when legitimate news outlets sound like The Onion.~~
Bill: ```â€” Right on cue, Juliet would like to talk to Char. Unfortunately, if she comes into their shared room now, Charâ€™s secret love will be revealed. So like I predicted, Romio will help Char out of this predicament, and as a result, she will owe him. Butâ€¦ is this something that you want to keep hidden from your girlfriend? Wouldnâ€™t you want your girlfriend to know that her childhood friend creepily stalks her? Or is this just another case of them both being girls, so itâ€™s, like, totally harmless, you guys.```
