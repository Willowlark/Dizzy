Nokri (Marisa): ~~jess is online~~
jess how goes v
Aldus (Jess): Ok so
Aldus (Jess): How am I supposed to romance V is he literally hasn't been in any chat rooms all day
Aldus (Jess): Ray showed up! He wants to talk to me, not V tho. Classic V
Nokri (Marisa): orly? v pls. maybe he's busy <:lenny:395307171539189760>
One thing in this is that you can get V and Ray hearts while they aren't in the chat. I assume it's something to do with them reading the chats later but if V keeps staying scarce, the ray chats can help with his hearts
Aldus (Jess): Yeaaaa I mean I've gotten a few
Nokri (Marisa): He should show up more tomorrow tho
Aldus (Jess): Yay!
Aldus (Jess): Blue hair boi shall be mine in approximately 7-10 business days
Nokri (Marisa): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/6/61/V_Emoji1.gif/revision/latest?cb=20170910153828
Nokri (Marisa): cheritz is having a quote contest now on twitter so if you see any good quotes send 'em in
Aldus (Jess): Besides that I flirted with everyone else ~~like da how u am~~
Nokri (Marisa): did u miss them
you missed them didn't you
Aldus (Jess): ~~ye~~
Aldus (Jess): Also this gem
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH THE JUMIN COSPLAY CHAT
Aldus (Jess): I do not know of this "cosplay"
Aldus (Jess): And then zen was like "would you rather cosplay me or jumin?" And I answered seven and he was like "mc plz"
Nokri (Marisa): so meta
Nokri (Marisa): the cosplay chat is awesome
Nokri (Marisa): it's gonna get better they aren't gonna drop it so quickly

A LIVE ACTION
that's not an anime aw man
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-05-28/live-action-sachiiro-no-one-room-series-reveals-cast-july-8-premiere/.132136
Nokri (Marisa): "the heartwarming story" lol
Aldus (Jess): "The heartwarming story centers on a girl and her kidnapper." ü§î
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): naw it's far more tragic <:lenny:395307171539189760>
the girl is abused and the guy is a stalker (his entire apartment looks like miketsukami's secret Ririchiyo room from the last episode of inu x boku), he kidnaps her. kidnapped life is better than abusive life with parents and being bullied at school so she stays there. someone starts making videos and posting them online claiming to be the kidnapper but the manga is hinting that it's the teacher who would molest her at school, trying to blackmail her into returning.

so heartwarming
Nokri (Marisa): ray is better than the guy in this story because we don't know his name <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus (Jess): omg that is tragic
Aldus (Jess): ~~sounds good thou~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~it is kind of cute~~

Nokri (Marisa): __***a whole server of just tom's picture***__
Aldus (Jess): seven was trying to romance tom the whole time
Nokri (Marisa): biru come back and type what you were typing we know you want a tom route too
Aldus (Jess): the toms routes great, i dont even have to end it to do other routes
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I already said I want the MC route.
Bill: She pretty heckin cute.
Bill: minus the lack of eyes thing.

Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: üëå
Aldus (Jess): ~~is she talking about echo girl, cuz she a hoe~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~ye~~
Bill: ~~It'd be appropriate for me to die for saying that yes~~
Nokri (Marisa): what about unicorn MC
Nokri (Marisa): i think redhead MC is the most popular
Nokri (Marisa): biru confirmed unicorn furry
Aldus (Jess): OMG I love when ppl draw unicorn mc comics
Aldus (Jess): yea red haired mc is lit
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): same toda
same
Nokri (Marisa): the manga might end soon oh no
Bill: *me but there's no Aya&
Nokri (Marisa): gvhjk
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Nokri (Marisa): majestic
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Hahahahahah
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: üëå üëå üëå üëå
Nokri (Marisa): MC would be a good cosplay for while I'm working at a con. I have a very realistic looking white cat toy i can use for elizabeth. the issue is I don't want to get *another* long brown wig. i have like 10 of them all slightly different. my real hair would be perfect but real hair sucks for cosplay.
maybe i'll just wear all the wigs at once
Nokri (Marisa): someone teach me how to contour for ray
I contoured once for yuu and looked like a girl with dark concealer smeared on her face
Aldus (Jess): ooo i tried to do the man contour for seven and it was terrible so i was like "rip ill just use the power of my naturally ridgid jaline
Aldus (Jess): i can only lady contour
Nokri (Marisa): i can get cheap eyeshadow here i'll try practicing with that
YEAH why does guy makeup have to be so difficult
Nokri (Marisa): i mostly wanna make my eyes look smaller because my eyes are freakish and giant
Aldus (Jess): all you really need are those sweet dark circles under your eyes
Nokri (Marisa): TRUE
Aldus (Jess): dark circles pulled toms unknown cosplay together so well
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Oh the faked ones?
Aldus (Jess): ye
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): whoops i googled "ray cosplay" and was wondering why rooster teeth kept showing up. i am dumb
eye circles and desperation is the key to this costume
Aldus (Jess): someone should let that boi rest
Aldus (Jess): opps
Nokri (Marisa): circles are more a saeran thing it seems. ray doesn't have circles on his emoji
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i'm laughing at the circles though it's really funny now that they've been pointed out
Aldus (Jess): OH YEA look at that
Nokri (Marisa): oo i have the perfect wig for him i just have to paint the ends
Aldus (Jess): lmao so when he changed personalities they just spawn? XD
Nokri (Marisa): "hold on let me paint these circles on to be edgy"
Aldus (Jess): probably
Aldus (Jess): when toms said hed cosplay saeran i was like "ok but which one" and toms was like "def not the prince one"
Nokri (Marisa): OH I HAVE A VIOLIN THAT WOULD BE COOL TO RECREATE THIS
Nokri (Marisa): [puts a crown on tom's unknown cosplay]
Bill: *The prince one looks dumb tbh*
Nokri (Marisa): fight me
Aldus (Jess): WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): if you want to cosplay him but don't know which one just throw a dart at a dartboard and pick where it lands
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: What even are those gloves
Aldus (Jess): RAY IS A NATIONAL TREASURE
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: YOU DONT WVEN KNKW RAY YET FAKE NERD
Nokri (Marisa): some kind of chauffeur gloves or somethin
Aldus (Jess): nah i know enough he made me brunch this morning
Nokri (Marisa): ray would steal the declaration of independance for us
Bill: Isn't it some bullshit like Rika picks his outfits or something, so he dresses unironically like a prince?
Nokri (Marisa): i don't think so. it's never really mentioned, I think he just does it for the Aesthetic‚Ñ¢
the high-ranking members of mint eye are always dressed for a fancy party
Nokri (Marisa): if rika picked his outfits it doesn't make sense for it to change with his personality
Aldus (Jess): where do you even buy clothes like that lmao
Nokri (Marisa): at the soup store
Aldus (Jess): oh tru
Bill: definitely dumb.
Aldus (Jess): saeran is like hot topic pre-2010 and ray is post 2010 hottopic when they added color
Bill: sticky to the edgy boi.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm cosplaying the crybaby and no one can stop me <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): DO IT
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): too real
Aldus (Jess): rays actually just bandon urie from panic at the disco
Nokri (Marisa): i'm afraid
Aldus (Jess): lmao i was just thinking that hes the only other person ive even seen wear that color suit jacket
Bill: *because it's dumb*
Aldus (Jess): GET OUT
Bill: Brandon Urie can do it though.
Nokri (Marisa): oh i forgot he has a white suit too in one of the DLCs. purple one, black one, white one.
Aldus (Jess): *grabby hands*
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): mfw biru insults ray
Bill: That's vaguely creepy looking.
Nokri (Marisa): ya it's supposed to be, his song is creepy too
Bill: *what's wrong with the shadows for his face*
Bill: *It's so off*
Aldus (Jess): ~~ok actually brandon uries style is really fitting cuz half the time he lookes like edge boi ‚Ñ¢  and half the time he looks like hes going to some vintage ball~~
Aldus (Jess): i think hes supposed to feel "off"
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuCPGXwOrZ4
Nokri (Marisa): what face shadows
Aldus (Jess): under his chin i think he means
Bill: ^
Nokri (Marisa): it's his affection seeping out in the form of dark matter don't worry about it
Bill: MM is such a kink fest.
Nokri (Marisa): they pure
Bill: Doesn't help MC is a fairly typical bishounen game protagonist, IE, a complete push over.
Aldus (Jess): NA MC no push over she knows exactly what she doing
Nokri (Marisa): "pushover"
Bill: *Put me in a cage Jumin*
Aldus (Jess): look she wants that shit at that point
Nokri (Marisa): mc is hardcore she causes the death of some people in certain bad ends
Nokri (Marisa): ~~and possibly good ends~~
Aldus (Jess): MC is metal af
Nokri (Marisa): i had an idea for an AU in class today i'll try and draw it later this week
Aldus (Jess): "Hi im saeran choi and welcome to my makeup channel, today im going to be reviewing eyeliners"
Nokri (Marisa): youtube ad revenue to make money for mint eye
Nokri (Marisa): perfect
Aldus (Jess): is it ever said in canon if his eye color is contacts or from elixir?
Nokri (Marisa): naw it's never mentioned
though in the very first/original bad ending in the casual story he sends a picture of "himself" saying he has contacts in, though people believe that picture might actually be rika. we have no idea who it is
Nokri (Marisa): could be drugs. don't do drugs.
Aldus (Jess): ooo cuz ive been wondering that. why u keep secret cheritz
Aldus (Jess): wait is that the "prologue kid"
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): ~~tom is that you~~
Aldus (Jess): yea! i never got a bad end i was wondering where he was from lmao
Aldus (Jess): maybe its rika in a wig
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH that's the biggest theory
Aldus (Jess): that guys eyes are like bright green though, saerans are like blue green
Aldus (Jess): oh im sorry *mint*
Nokri (Marisa): yeah. it's a lot closer to rika's but hers are still lighter
Aldus (Jess): oh true
Aldus (Jess): biggest pet peave is everyones all like "oh v has mint eyes and hair" and im like "bitch thats turquoise"
Aldus (Jess): maybe teal, id even settle for light blue, but it aint mint
Nokri (Marisa): ya it always looks a little different
Aldus (Jess): also true
Nokri (Marisa): fight! fight! fight!
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: You know what's actually going to happen to the RFA?
Bill: They'
Bill: They're going to get slapped with a lawsuit for hiring discrimination. Funny how it's all guys, isn't it.
Aldus (Jess): They're all gong to live happily ever after with all their problems solved?
Nokri (Marisa): what why
they're a non-profit
Nokri (Marisa): jaehee
Aldus (Jess): its a volunteer charity organization they dont get "hired"
Nokri (Marisa): i can't believe jaehee, rika, and mc are guys. wow.
Aldus (Jess): SHIT
Nokri (Marisa): we've been bamboozled
Bill: ~~Not to mention the sexual harassment lawsuits~~
Nokri (Marisa): wat
Nokri (Marisa): biru i think you need to play mystic mess
Aldus (Jess): lul wat
Bill: Gunna happen.
Nokri (Marisa): didn't zen almost sue echo girl for harassment
Bill: Ultra Hyper Secret Arc: A lawyer calls up MC asking if she was locked in an apartment. He then tell her to sue all of the members of the RFA for kidnapping.
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Aldus (Jess): no one can sue jumin, hell just countersue, hes the master of sueing
Nokri (Marisa): she can leave in most routes. sometimes there's a bomb but not always.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Me randomly remembering that one of my first few anime's I watched through was this
Nokri (Marisa): also yea jumin is invincible
Nokri (Marisa): ooo i've cosplayed that
Bill: I tried to torrent that a few times.
Bill: Never found a good copy.
Nokri (Marisa): neko mimi mode desu
Nokri (Marisa): i have the entire dvd boxset we can marathon it
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I can hear the song now <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): nya
Nokri (Marisa): 2 people miraculously knew who i was cosplaying
Aldus (Jess): show cosplay
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: YEAH
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I watched it on my vampire kick
Nokri (Marisa): this was waaay before i started getting pictures taken of costumes. like the first or second year i cosplayed. i still have the costume tho
Nokri (Marisa): i can check but i don't think i have any photos lemme see
Nokri (Marisa): no i don't see any albums from this con on facebook it was like 2010
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Aghhh,
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Your gonna need to costest that for us sometime
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: üëå
Bill: ~~or loan it to Tom~~
Bill: ~~for reasons~~
Nokri (Marisa): neko mimi mode desu
we can do luna and hazuki
Bill: And screw MM, I'mma just embrace the trash can life style and play this.
Nokri (Marisa): o that got a kickstarter anime
Nokri (Marisa): chocolat and vanilla
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> YEAH
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: The classics
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Not nekopara
Bill: > adopts cats
> cats turn into girls
> ~~sex?~~
Bill: Pretty sure nekopara is actually M, but not R.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: No it's R
Bill: Lewds, but no actual sex content.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: We'll.. steam release is lewds only. But full.release is sex
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: One of them
Bill: I'd look this up but I'm not going on vndb at IBM.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Ashley has 100% that game
Nokri (Marisa): why not the anime with the girls who are soda instead
Bill: Because Nekopara is a game, but the exact opposite of MM. All girls, No plot.
Bill: I guess not exact opposite, since there's still plenty of eye candy.
Nokri (Marisa): oh you'd like doki doki literature club
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Pffft
Bill: Andrew has me on the hook to play that where he can watch.
Nokri (Marisa): ask him to record it
Bill: That's the idea.
Bill: Maybe I'll do that instead of the next formal.
Aldus (Jess): ~~wow i have to go to fanfic for that stuff~~
Bill: for what...?
Aldus (Jess): ~~the sexual contents~~
Bill: Sweet child. Most visual novels are utter trash that only exist for the porn.
Bill: Mystic Messenger is the special snowflake here. in a good way.
Nokri (Marisa): Misconception! Most aren‚Äôt but the vast majority of translated ones are
Aldus (Jess): ~~send me ones with bois~~ <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): There‚Äôs a ton of non H ones that are the quiet majority
Bill: I've flipped through VNDB Mawisa. Trash is the majority.
Nokri (Marisa): Indie stuff
Bill: Bishounen games aren't as popular, but exist. And every MC is a submissive girl surrounded by hot men who love pinning her against walls.
Nokri (Marisa): What about Kenka bancho otome where it‚Äôs a reverse harem and the MCs goal is to become the ultimate gang leader
Nokri (Marisa): Through *friendship*
Aldus (Jess): ~~sounds great~~
Aldus (Jess): yall can decide who im answering with that one <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): Dangan ronpa is a visual novel too that isn‚Äôt ecchi
Bill: I'm not saying non H doesn't exist, just that trash is the majority.
Bill: I think the opposite of what you said actually, more of the actual content gets translated because there's no ratings issues from the US.
Nokri (Marisa): The vocal majority which must be purged 
All the top google results for me didn‚Äôt include a single h but that could also be just recommendations based on search history
Bill: The US isn't going to be big on translating 'me and the student council president fuck in every classroom of our school before graduation ~~in another world probably~~'.
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs one in the morning but later when I turn my computer on again I shall dig up data to show the world is pure
Bill: go to VNDB, random search. Do not at work.
Aldus (Jess): ~~ill just stick with the fanfic thanks~~
Bill: Meant for marisa.
Nokri (Marisa): Biru is harassing me time to file a suit
Bill: Watch she somehow ends up with Clannad (which has never had an 18+ edition) via the random button.
Nokri (Marisa): Why is the site taking forever to load
Bill: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Bill: I'd look, but at work.
Nokri (Marisa): Ew what is this it‚Äôs a mess on mobile
Aldus (Jess): too many thirsty people
Nokri (Marisa): Oh are dot com and dot org different
Dot com is a mess and dot org won‚Äôt load
Bill: it's org.
Nokri (Marisa): Man remember gendou
What a great music site
Nokri (Marisa): Visual novel site refuses to load on mobile but first thing in morning *i shall return*
Bill: *I proved the point in bobbie physics already though*
Nokri (Marisa): Hacks
Aldus (Jess): Damn Ray's selfie skills are on fucking point
Nokri (Marisa): Perfection
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: He's telekenitic
Aldus (Jess): damn boi
Nokri (Marisa): Selfie stick out of frame
Or maybe a security camera
Aldus (Jess): also my theory is that cheritz only released V first so people would actually do his route cuz shit ray is hard to resist
Aldus (Jess): like hack: use your hacking skills to get good pics of yourself in the garden
Nokri (Marisa): Biru look at all of that coding isn‚Äôt it great
PROBABLY ray is awesome
Nokri (Marisa): Garden: hacked
Aldus (Jess): there was a chat with jumin and v this morning and i was like "MC is third wheeling this man date"
Aldus (Jess): i see why people ship them
Nokri (Marisa): ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind me boys just do whatever‚Äù
Aldus (Jess): "get a room jeez"
Nokri (Marisa): ~~a chatroom~~
Aldus (Jess): MC: "ill just.... leave"
Andrew: <@&398644763043299328>
Dave: Are Andrew and I the only ones in the overmeme group, seeing as we're the only ones who are actively try to kill ourselves?
Bill: Nah, overmemes is anyone with PC overwatch.
Bill: I need to get time to play some with ya'll.
Bill: Hal, Jess, Kurtis, Tom, Me, Andrew, You.
Dave: ~~tom~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~jess~~
Dave: I see you got hit with that second hand salt exposure
Aldus (Jess): Nah I got hit with that I suck at shooters exposure üòÇ
Dave: Come back to fabulous hanjo
Aldus (Jess): ~~but my aim is terrible~~
~~even if he is beautiful~~
