Aldus Larian (Jess): So the vday dlc is free? 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it? :0 I don't think so, I think you pay per character
Aldus Larian (Jess): Horror story
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wanna do that one but I want hourglasses so maybe I'll do Christmas
N🆗ri (Marisa): christmas good for farming hourglasses
Aldus Larian (Jess): Since I was so busy around actual Christmas I didn't get to do it

Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooooo idk I wanted to try to do drawings on my computer but digital art hates me
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have cosplay stuff to try on but I'm cold and don't wanna 😂

N🆗ri (Marisa): this is literally the 8th character in a series' i've read today named Asahi. i really like the name but pls. variety. i beg u.
Aldus Larian (Jess): is it a last name?
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah it a first name
N🆗ri (Marisa): the girl in suijin no ikenie is also named Asahi :3 that was the first series i heard the name in
and the best friend in that really long named manga i like that updated earlier today is Asahi
and 6 other series from today <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Fukushuu wo Chikatta Shironeko wa Ryuuou no Hiza no jou de Damin wo Musaboru
yeah that's the name of it
i enjoy that series
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😮
Bill: Girl you love your fluttery dresses.
N🆗ri (Marisa): TRU but she spends most of the series as a cat
Bill: Oh that sounds cute.
Bill: Isn’t there a VN like that?
N🆗ri (Marisa): pawsibly? 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): most likely
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hol up
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You read over 8 series today <:lenny:395307171539189760> ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): "All Ruri Midorikawa wanted out of college life was an escape from the shadow of her best “frenemy,” Asahi Shinomiya. Despite her best intentions, Asahi has always made Ruri’s life miserable… so it’s no surprise things go sideways when the two of them are summoned to another world together!

Now alone in a completely unfamiliar world and betrayed by the only people she thought she could depend on, our hot-headed heroine swears vengeance…"

she's loved by the spirits and that makes her insanely powerful, but she didn't want to be used as a pawn so she spends most of the time as a magical talking cat chilling out with the dragon king
thus the title being "the white cat in the lap of the dragon king swears vengeance" or somethin
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no I read far more than that
N🆗ri (Marisa): i read 8 series this hour because of the webtoon updates
N🆗ri (Marisa): just chapters from different series. i only started 5 ish new manga today.

N🆗ri (Marisa): Same as the normal route but it’s Christmas!
Aldus Larian (Jess): so fast <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): why this game give me chances to compliment V if hes not an option

N🆗ri (Marisa): Christmas dlc does have an unknown route
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *Complimenting V gets you a bad route*
Bill: *PLease*

Aldus Larian (Jess): complimenting V gets you unknown? XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): cheritz y u do
Bill: You *want* unknown tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): *runs head first into bad end*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nah V is unrelated. Unknown’s path can’t really be gotten until Christmas Day
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooooo ok gotcha a i was gonna say damn
Bill: *Which means complimenting V gives you nothing but a bad ending and he should die alone*
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~V has the happiest after ending dont try to change my mind~~
Bill: ~~and he dies in Canon~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~fuck canon~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Only in one canon. In the others he’s blind, has cancer, and sacrificed himself to be a pawn forever
