Nokri (Marisa): im seeing it all over instagram and facebook
Nokri (Marisa): OH SNAP THEY HAVE MANGA TOO

Nokri (Marisa): basically every girl other than amu on the student council <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): üëå üëå üëå üëå

Elfriede (Tom): Shugo Chara you are far too clever for me
Nokri (Marisa): ye! there was an angel and a devil chara. i think they were utau's charas but amu was able to transform with them too because amu just steals everyones dreams or something.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): amu needs to chill with the dreams here
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao, this shows plot
Elfriede (Tom): Top tier
Elfriede (Tom): For the favorite series bingo do you have to like the series, or just have seen it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): probably just seen it
Nokri (Marisa): one of my favorite parts about this show is that the charas can just possess people randomly. like the prince guy would just randomly start acting arrogant if his chara felt he was being too useless
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I remember him being a brat at times!
Nokri (Marisa): and yaya would just start acting like a baby because why not apparently
Elfriede (Tom): Of course! What better impression could you make on the 10-12y.o.s whating this show
Elfriede (Tom): And amu gets the powerpiff girls as charas cuz reasons
Nokri (Marisa): special snowflake with 4 charas smh
Nokri (Marisa): it can't beat kamichama karin though. DANG I SHOULDA PUT THAT ON BINGO KARIN IS GREAT
Nokri (Marisa): it's a magical girl show and their magical transforming catchphrase is "I am god"
Elfriede (Tom): If her eyes get any further apart <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): That's literally all I know about that show üòÇ

Nokri (Marisa): i was looking up classic anime a few hours ago and Kill la Kill was on a few lists of classic shows i was like. huh.

Nokri (Marisa): passion 4 anime
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): there was someone who really killed themself when death note ended
Nokri (Marisa): or so the media claims
Nokri (Marisa): i don't quite think that's true though. hm. it's like the guy who was arrested at a park earlier this year for stealing whistles from kids "because anime made him do it"
Elfriede (Tom): Lmaooo
Elfriede (Tom): The opening that gives me the most "old anime.nostalgia" is bouken desho desho
Elfriede (Tom): Something about it is just so different from modern openings
Nokri (Marisa): BOUKEN DESHOU DESHOU HONTOU WA USO NI
Nokri (Marisa): there's a dance for that too
Elfriede (Tom): I'm sure there is :3
Nokri (Marisa): it from the video game

Elfriede (Tom): Agh I never touched the radio dramas ~~cuz I didn't know they existed~~
Nokri (Marisa): radio dramas are the jam
Nokri (Marisa): did you ever hear the one of the attack on titan voice actors singing the theme song
Elfriede (Tom): Hayate was one of my older ones too

Nokri (Marisa): hare hare yukai has a lot but I think Dear You has a ton more
Elfriede (Tom): Oo this video of them singing it is so pure
Nokri (Marisa): AA AA AA AA
Elfriede (Tom): Attack on Titans season 1 opening was so lit
Nokri (Marisa): *sneak attack by georgia*
Elfriede (Tom): I'm like 70% sure that was the reason I started watching the anime
Nokri (Marisa): was it not because of the naked giants
Elfriede (Tom): Oo rosaria vampire I watched during that time too
Elfriede (Tom): And the classic vm
Vampire knight
Nokri (Marisa): rosario + vampire cosplayers probably invented boudoir
*georgia what are those emoji*
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): the giants aint got no peen
Elfriede (Tom): MOT WRONG THO
Nokri (Marisa): *young lady your language*
Nokri (Marisa): NO
Nokri (Marisa): I WAS TOO LATE
Nokri (Marisa): there was one group at a con that had a whole photoshoot for upskirt shots
Elfriede (Tom): Oh no! How long ago was this
Elfriede (Tom): Did they get a bat to censor it üëå
Nokri (Marisa): nope üò≠ It was a while ago, like at least 2012
Elfriede (Tom): 
Elfriede (Tom): Themost obnoxious form of censorship ever invented
Nokri (Marisa): yeah from 2010, i'll post in nsfw
Elfriede (Tom): An animated bat that takes up 3/4 of the screen
Nokri (Marisa): is it time to talk about censorship
Nokri (Marisa): have you seen sayonara zetsubou sensei
Elfriede (Tom): I don't think I have
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): i heard of it but never saw it myself
Nokri (Marisa): they censor stuff with the animation director's face
Elfriede (Tom): Omggg
Nokri (Marisa): thank u for your service sir
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Beautiful
Nokri (Marisa): there was a guy who got kicked out of otakon for taking upskirt shots, he thought it was hilarious and uploaded a video to youtube of him doing it and complaining about being kicked out. it's disgusting
Elfriede (Tom): Omfg
Elfriede (Tom): That sounds aweful
Nokri (Marisa): it was right around when panty and stocking was popular so there were two cosplayers doing a photoshoot in the corner, one lifted the other's skirt for a funny picture but because they were in a corner there was no one behind them and it was fine. dude just purposefully walks behind them and starts taking pictures like wth
Nokri (Marisa): and then staff threw him out
Nokri (Marisa): man. anime and cons were a whole different world like 5 years ago.
Elfriede (Tom): OMG THAT'S TERRIBLE
Elfriede (Tom): Lays on floor and slides under someone already in photoshoot
Elfriede (Tom): I'm sorry an I making you uncomfortable
Nokri (Marisa): "you don't mind if i stand RIGHT HERE where you purposefully made sure there were no people, right?"
