that'll be tricky though with the OVAs they released.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Shit I forgot about ovas!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah!! you can probably watch the first one, but the second two OVAs have huge spoilers for chapter 100. i'd recommend getting to that in the manga first but it's ur life free will
