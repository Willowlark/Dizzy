秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): (she's really not fat) (i guess when everyone in japan is stick-thin being a little pudgy is a lot more noticeable, so she might be a little pudgy but definitely not fat)

Bill: Hunter suggested it when Leanna told us about her boyfriend.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh that's what everyone is seeing
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Right right
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that's the animated one right?
Bill: mm.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's the one with the not Peter Parker spoink?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I know like nothing. About the spiderverse
Bill: I don't know too much.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Cept like what was in Spiderman n64
Bill: But Spider Gwen and I'm all about her.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's got a bunch of different iterations of spiderman
Bill: yeah. Pretty sure it stars the black spider man miles morales.
Bill: And then he crosses over into the other comic canons?
Bill: idk.
Bill: Should be fun.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah the trailer looked really cool
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh huh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): who even is spider gwen? like i see her everywhere
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but i know nothing about her
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Me either lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I think she's one of Peter's girlfriends that in an au got turned into a spider
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): she's an official AU yeah, gwen stacy is one of peter parker's girlfriends (i think his original one out of all the spideys?) and in this series she's the one bitten instead of him
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo so technically spiderman and spider gewen dont exist in the same timeline?
Bill: Yup.
Bill: It's literally AU cross overs.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ah
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i know nothing about spiderman at all
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it'd be fun if Access was in the movie. he's a character that exists solely so characters can cross worlds/dimensions and marvel could do crossovers with DC
Bill: you two could come if you want?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): which one are you going to?
Bill: 7pm. AMC Bridgewater.
Bill: I'd mention it to Hunter, it's reserved seating so getting near each other requires for thought.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): mm das far
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah don't wanna go that far today
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And I'm not actually super interested in the movie
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ☝
Bill: Just a thought.
Bill: Glad Erik is coming tho.
Bill: Low key feel like both Hunter and Leanna might gossip about me in the bad way when I’m not around. 😅
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nah Yu fine
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you're paranoid
Bill: I love how those can be ready totally opposite lol.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I don’t think you’re the hot topic right now billiam
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): No ones particularly interested in dragging you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): she wants to drag her ex
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not u
Bill: “Right now” 

*So I have been a hot topic*
Bill: Also why would it matter right now, neither of them are going to insult me to my face 😂
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Neither hates you bill
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It’s all in your head
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): What reason would they have to gossip about you?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The only reason hunter would dig you is for photography, and he wouldn’t even do that, cause he does photos to make friends, just like you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): He’s not competitive about it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): And obviously Leanna doesn’t hate you, your only evidence of that is that she forgot to message you about shooting
Bill: I don
Bill: I don't think they hate me, promise. Iii just feel like they could nitpick me for... whatever people nitpick me for, they seem the type. Like we nitpick people in bn-tea. Intersquad boundaries.
Bill: thanks, all three of you.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): We nitpick people in BNE yeah but the only people we DRAG really deserve it
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Otherwise it’s like one comment about someone else per month
Bill: The Atlas has an emp cannon and that's fucking amazing.
Bill: Finished Voltron.
Bill: ~~someone else finish it kthx~~
