Total Nok-out (Marisa): I checked five stores. But I did find this. 
Code Geass AU where Lulu is a home tutor.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): It pains me when online scans ~~which I totally don‚Äôt read because they‚Äôre totally not legal~~ are like 20 chapters into a series and then the store is advertising ‚Äúbook 90 on sale today!!‚Äù Like, What!!! How are the scans ten billion chapters behind and where do I catch up.

No, but I'm Elfriede of Nokri: Now I have questions
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hawt
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Yeah it looked like Lulu was CC‚Äôs tutor
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I saw the plmessage preview and ngl I was expecting a different lulu and I was not disappointed
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Isn't CC like a bajillion years old? What is dis boi teaching her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So many questions for real
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Astrophysics
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Dayum

Total Nok-out (Marisa): 
Total Nok-out (Marisa): That‚Äôs her house/dorm room
Total Nok-out (Marisa): It seems pretty bad oops. Each chapter is basically CC messing around and being dumb, Lulu getting super angry, CC being cutesy and he forgives her and they smile and laugh about it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): SO MANY QUESTIONS

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): why is her room/apartment all boxes

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so she cant have babies either then right?
No, but I'm Elfriede of Nokri: True
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is that canon?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~so many questions~~
No, but I'm Elfriede of Nokri: Most likely
No, but I'm Elfriede of Nokri: I mean she can literally be blown into pieces and heal so
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~but then how am i supposed to get green haired, purple eyed babies?~~
No, but I'm Elfriede of Nokri: She would need to give her code away
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOO

Bill: Allison did Kofuku tho.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): TINY KAICHO SHOW US YOUR KOFUKU
Total Nok-out (Marisa): the costume exists but it's like $50+
Total Nok-out (Marisa): if i could ever find the fabric it'd be way cheaper
Bill: it's on my site.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think she bought it
Total Nok-out (Marisa): doxxed
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not positive
Total Nok-out (Marisa): search function on your website when
Bill: Never.
Bill: It'd require my site to be dynamic, I don't have that.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ooo spotted. ~~started from the back i shoulda started at the front, i saw all my past mistakes~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): that yato has nice hair
Total Nok-out (Marisa): greaser yato
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wtf is bishamon doinggggggg
Total Nok-out (Marisa): her best
Bill: Huh.
Bill: Technically you should be able to search my site via `site:thelittlethingswemiss.us <whatever>`in google, but I guess google doesn't crawl my site.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i'm not good with faces but i don't think that's tom and jess
http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/gallery/2018/07/19/noragami-next18.html
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it is not
Bill: Nope.
Bill: Do I need a sitemap maybe?
Bill: I can add one of those..
Bill: So much shit today...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OO i remebered i have mawisa question
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is it hard to make a pleated skirt?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): nah it's super easy
Total Nok-out (Marisa): extra steps to make the pleats more permanent though ü§î
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz i remade hiyoris top and its slight different than the bottoms that i bought, i already have the pattern cut but im scared
Total Nok-out (Marisa): for hiyori's skirt you can make the waistband and pleats separate so it's easier and the pleats can be sewn into the waistband to make them longer lasting
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH and your adive witht eh color worked you asaved me so much time XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA i think thats how the directions work too
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ye u fine then! it's a lot of ironing and you could use starch or pelon to make it stiffer if you want, but it's basically just measuring/folding the fabric over and over until you have enough pleats and sewin' it to the waist band
Total Nok-out (Marisa): then elastic or a zipper and tadaa
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ok i will atempt this
Total Nok-out (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i need a new, loger ribbon for the colar two cuz the one the bought version came with was not good looking
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~and maybe pink contacts~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): what's the anime magical girl who uses ribbon in her attack names ü§î
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üòÆ ooo idk
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo man things are getting spicy and im confused XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): bishamon wants to kill yatos dad, but if yatos dad dies yato dies (?) and because biahmon stole the burried vessel now the heaven are coming after her. ANd kazumas going to prison? (Kazuma never did anything wrong leave him alone üò≠)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): bishamon why u doooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this manga cray
Total Nok-out (Marisa): just u wait <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Total Nok-out (Marisa): we dunno if yato will die if his father dies but bishamonten don't care she's hardcore
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): big oof.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): damn we went from matchmaking to this in like 4 chapters whoo!
Total Nok-out (Marisa): that's good storytelling. when something is fun and lighthearted you know it's goin' down.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ~~yona does it too i love it~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): meanwhile this is all going down right in front of hiyoris school. ~~also y she bring yatos mini shrine to school im afraid that wont end well~~

animation-wise, how it's portrayed.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): i love my children who have Suffered
https://data.whicdn.com/images/238231217/original.gif
No, but I'm Elfriede of Nokri: üëå üëå üëå

Total Nok-out (Marisa): https://because.moe/ is a good website that tells you what anime are available on legal streaming services so if there's something you wanna watch, just search it (the english title) and it'll tell you if crunchyroll/netflix has it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo neat! yea i want to see that and tokyo goul really bad
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Don‚Äôt watch Tokyo ghoul while eating

Total Nok-out (Marisa): I wanna give the second season another shot. I‚Äôve tried like three times to watch the first episode of season two and failed for some reason.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Def not a popcorn anime though
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you come over when u get home, we watch
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): with no food XD
Bill: I always though Seraph looked too magical high school to be good...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~do you think anything looks good?~~
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Magical??? :0
It‚Äôs vampire war
Total Nok-out (Marisa): It‚Äôs kind of like the promised never land but on a smaller scale and with vampires instead of demons
Bill: It's got a high school for special magical high school students.
Bill: That's a red flag in my world.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): What
Does it? I don‚Äôt remember that. The super brief high school scenes are pretty normal and there isn‚Äôt any magic in the world. Cursed swords and possessed weapons but no magic
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Are you not thinking of The Irregular at Magic High
Total Nok-out (Marisa): They‚Äôre never at school because ugly uniforms
Bill: Hmm. Maybe where I first hear it described was snarking on it.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Time to watch it right now and form your own opinion this instant
Bill: I'm at work, so.
Bill: I mean, maybe it's your sword art.
Bill: Sword Art is objectively bad, but I like it all the same.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Right now. Your coworkers behind you can watch it too.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lol i watched the irregular at magic highschool
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was trash
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Of all shows why that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tom made fun of me the whole time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was on netflix XD
Bill: irregular is the KING of the trash.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like before netflix had alot of animes
Total Nok-out (Marisa): I cosplay sword art and ran the shoot at Otakon a while back I don‚Äôt hate it
Total Nok-out (Marisa): You poor thing jess
Total Nok-out (Marisa): We need to get you some good anime. Go rewatch Yona.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i never got the hang of finding good torents so i just watched whatever i found on netflix and we did have cronchroll yet
