Dirty Lego (Tom): happy birthday to the most beautiful man
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): you know what's one of the top 10 saddest anime deaths of all time
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): that scene from ballroom when they're dancing and the girl's stuffed her dress with bra enhancers and the one side entirely falls out during her performance
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): *they only advance in the competition because the bra pads cause everyone else to trip and they're the only couple still standing*
competitive dance anime be crazy
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Thereâ€™s a few accessories I want to add to my Emma cosplay but they donâ€™t come in until later (chapter 30 something) and I donâ€™t wanna be that person cosplaying a walking spoiler
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): awww
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Maybe I use them real quick for photoshoot
Then put them away
Dirty Lego (Tom): Maybe ðŸ¤”
Dirty Lego (Tom): Are they like real big spoilers or just outfit spoilers?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): One probably wouldnâ€™t be recognized as a spoiler people might think itâ€™s just a weird prop for posing 
The other................ kind of? Itâ€™d be very noticeable, itâ€™s not a new outfit but itâ€™s a thing. Itâ€™s visible in a lot of the manga art and if you google Emma it shows up in the top results.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I havenâ€™t seen any cosplayers do it so I was considering it, but itâ€™s something that canâ€™t be redone once taken off itâ€™s a one-time thing for the costume so I couldnâ€™t reuse it probably
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Donâ€™t worry my boy Iâ€™m here again
