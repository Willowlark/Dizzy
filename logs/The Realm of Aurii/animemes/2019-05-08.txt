NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): app store!
this one is Bang Dream
it's really similar to Love Live but that one has 9 sections and it's all original music (the love live music). in bang dream there's original music but there's also covers of famous anime songs like the Attack on Titan theme, Steins;Gate, Neon Genesis Evangelion, etc.

NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Love love is mobile game
Bang Dream has elements like power, purity, and coolness but I have no idea what they do unlike love live where that stuff is super important depending on the song
I think itâ€™s just a way to get more bonuses maybe
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i can see how bang dream replaced love live as the ultimate mobile idol rhythm game
the models in bandre are 3d, they move and change expressions naturally and it's really neat while the love live models are static. both in story modes and on stage. bandre allows you to interact with the characters for exp outside of the concert which love live doesn't do.
bandrea has covers of famous songs, and love live is really frustrating in that when you're doing a live show and trigger a special effect, the girl covers the whole screen and lots of sparks shoot out so *you can't see what notes you're supposed to hit*. i just tried paradise live and cutie panther and while i got through them i had a lot of missed notes because someone would come on screen and wash out all the notes rip
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): hey i'm level 95 though <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Rewatching her breakdown... I remembered her being more attacking to him?

Aldus Larian (Jess): marisas seen everything
Bill: ~~except K-On~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): only the first season and the movie
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): the "i can't understand you so stop hiding behind chuuni" is basically what happens, that's the same as "i don't get it"
Aldus Larian (Jess): whats chunni
Aldus Larian (Jess): is it a person
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> is this here?
