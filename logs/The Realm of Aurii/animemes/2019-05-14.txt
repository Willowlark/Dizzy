Bill: 
Bill: Tom and Jess (whose who is for you to decide)
Aldus Larian (Jess): both
Aldus Larian (Jess): both are both
Bill: I think this is from a doujin I read, which had lewd scenes but like, real relationship lewd and it was cute as fuck.
Bill: (It’s haruhi fyi)
Bill: Anime needs more intentional lewd and less “Kyaa you tripped into my thighs”
Aldus Larian (Jess): haruhi is lewd?
Bill: It’s not.
Bill: Really.
Bill: Haruhi gropes Mikuru a few times.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh "needs more" i readd "ends more"
Bill: But it’s not like, shitty harem anime.
Aldus Larian (Jess): sorry dyslexia kicked in
Bill: Nah fair question
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think i only saw the beginning?
Bill: The compliant is for all anime though. It’s like... afraid to have normal couple sex/intimacy.
Bill: It has to be totally accidental and embarrassing or like, they hold hands to get pregnant.
Aldus Larian (Jess): my complaint is no one ever says "I love you"
Bill: Well. They kinda do.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> fact check me, but like as in I like you is used interchangeably with love. You just kinda guess which they mean.
Nokri (Marisa): There are some anime that say love
In Japanese itself it’s used the same way we use it interchangeably in English. Same basic concept but with different connotations and levels of affection.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea i know
Aldus Larian (Jess): but its like one of them will be going on a life threatening mission and the other is like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Nokri (Marisa): If a character ever says the moon is beautiful that’s basically a love confession 🌛 it’s a reference to some poem everyone reads in school
Nokri (Marisa): “Make otaku stare at girls chests irl because they expect the dialogue box to be there” <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Or because. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: 2d obsessed as they may be they’re still *men*.
Nokri (Marisa): Men are gross <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Weeb trash like me are yeah!
Aldus Larian (Jess): This whole conversation is just <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): Only acceptable place to look at people: the ground in front of their feet because eye contact is scary
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or at their forehead to confuse them
