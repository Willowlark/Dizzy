Bill: Sword art is baaaad.
Bill: Even the storyline is all over the place now.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Haven't watched it since season 2
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is there more?
Bill: New season.
Bill: Alicization.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo haven't kept track
Bill: It was good till they started a boss rush up a tower and they just keep saying “I bet you wonder how I did this thing”. There were two straight episodes of sitting in a library expositioning. I have no idea what the secondary protagonist even thinking.
Bill: I’ve always liked SAO, and I’ll be the first to admit it’s not GREAT, but it better than this usually.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I only like season 1
Bill: Magical girl ptsd, spicy.
Bill: I love when they do darker and edgier magical girls.

Bill: Show feels like it belongs in the 2000's.

Dirty Lego (Tom): Tragedy
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like manga where the author adds a ton of little unnecessary details in the character's outfits. sadly it's only ever in non-mainstream manga because publishing deadlines crush all the little details and minute accessories.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that kind of happened in otoyomegatari. so detailed at first. then it got popular and had deadlines to meet.
Dirty Lego (Tom): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): rip amira's swanky underwear
Dirty Lego (Tom): So fancy omg
