Aldus Larian (Jess): found rays hair dye
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's electric! boogie woogie oogie
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is such indulgent trash omg
male character with the most typical hairstyle and eyes hidden so guys can project themselves onto him
loli girl who insists she is his wife and cooks, cleans, and does everything for him
main character refuses to give his name so loli wife calls him oni-san, because he is an oni but that also sounds like onii-san so it implies loli incest
it looks cute but it's truly horror in disguise
Aldus Larian (Jess): plz no
N🆗ri (Marisa): why there so much bad manga this week where's the good stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok finally something decent
N🆗ri (Marisa):
