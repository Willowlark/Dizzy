Bill: I've never met anyone named Lincoln but if I did. Link.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I know a kid named Lincoln who went by Abe
Bill: Wait marisa who you ship tho.
Bill: Kinda wanna find a new comic to read. Don't want to get hooked on something before con.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I ship canon
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): So Sam x Marshall
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I usually ship the canon couple unless itâ€™s a harem then Iâ€™m very lost
Bill: I mean ye true. Figured you'd like Link tho. He good boi.
Bill: Tho ~~Link Angela~~ has sparks and Sam Marshall eventually will.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I donâ€™t really like Link I liked Charles more until recent developments
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Yee
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Link is. Hmm. Too extreme?
Bill: He protecc
Bill: But I see what you mean.
Bill: Which developments? Cause Charles has had. Many.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ||why he sleeping around boi u so gross||
Bill: Oh really? He give me bad vibes way before that.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): He was neat. A little too forward. But now he is trash <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wanna click these spoilers really bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well I already clicked the first one
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: catch up and be the tie breaker on Charles.
Bill: *Jess: who? I can't see anything through Link's lushous locks*
Aldus Larian (Jess): I clicked the second one
Bill: Tis not as bad as Marisa makes it sound?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean link does have long hair, and he's a duel baritsa/emt and the drives a Wrangler ðŸ¤”
Bill: Everyone in this comic too ripped for you tho right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): But that's ok
Bill: ~~I suddenly understand unrealistic body expectations on women~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I haven't decided my opinion on Charles yet
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marshell has good potential he's got some stuff to.worn out but I'm way behind you guys
Bill: The density of hot and nerdy in these people is suspension of disbelief breaking.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean link makes somewhat sense cuz emt is a physical job but like you wouldn't be THAT ripped
Aldus Larian (Jess): it showed marshal running but running doesn't do THAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): need to read more tho
Bill: I mean, it fiction. I don't care that much. But like. You have a world of warcraft guild made up of the homely girl, a yoga instructor, a hot redhead, a MASSIVE black guy, a punk kid, and a rich loli. 

That should be a overweight programmer, an overweight weeb, someone's girlfriend, the token hot guy who barely shows up...
Bill: Oh, the guy living in his parents basement, can't forget him.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ITS FINE
Bill: I'd believe Marshall works out, since he's in entertainment. I dunno if you need abs you can grate cheese on if you keep your shirt on during streams though.
Bill: ~~or maybe he doesn't~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): like being that ripped takes major commitment
Bill: yeeee
Bill: Charles is the believable 'active lifestyle' build. Most believable rather.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WAIT
Aldus Larian (Jess): i totally though Angela and Vikki were girlfriends XD
Bill: YO ME TOO
Bill: Definitely though lesbeans first time they were around.
Bill: They explain them living together a little bit eventually.
Aldus Larian (Jess): the voice im giving charles in my head is so fancy man i hate it
Aldus Larian (Jess): holy fuck im dying her dad is hilarious
Bill: Heâ€™s perfect.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i feel like im watching sams sexual awakening
Bill: I mean.
Bill: Yes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
