No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?field-keywords=%E3%82%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): with the wig, or a ton of thick makeup on top. a lot of people actually aren't that good at hiding the tape and it's very obvious, others manage it behind perfectly sculpted wigs
