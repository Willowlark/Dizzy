Nokri (Marisa): All Might canonically punched a tornado away proving he is truly The Best
Nokri (Marisa): it wasn't even a villain it was just a normal tornado
Elfriede (Tom): He **can** make it rain by punching up
Elfriede (Tom): Only.make senses he can fight weather
Nokri (Marisa): he can also make it rain with a variety of all might exclusive merchandise
Nokri (Marisa): omg the bnha movie is already out? i am so far behind on anime this is murder
Aldus (Jess): When I do jaehees route I'm gonna be like "oh look how happy this is no one's dying"
Nokri (Marisa): are you sure about that <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Haha true
Aldus (Jess): You know what I mean tho
Nokri (Marisa): i'm behind on all anime but at least i'm 90% caught up on manga and webtoons
Nokri (Marisa): "slightly less death and cult activity with jaehee"
Aldus (Jess): Yea that!
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): ***j u s t  g a l s  b e i n g  p a l s***
Bill: MC cute as heck tho
Nokri (Marisa): [mc hand feeds jaehee cake] just bein a gal pal
Nokri (Marisa): OH
kusanagi-sensei dug up some of her older work and got interested in mugen spiral again, and according to her twitter might make another Mugen Spiral story which would be cool. basically yona before yona (she admitted that my theory is CANON)
Bill: Jaehee: Clearly obsessed with Zen
MC: hold my beer
V: holds beer
MC: *Woos Jaehee*
Jaehee: *hella gay now*
MC: *also hella gay*
V: cries
Nokri (Marisa): she's just a fan. totally just a fan. she doesn't get jealous of MC in zen's route but she threatens MC like "if you ruin his acting career so help me i will end you"
Nokri (Marisa): ~~Jaehee already married to her job~~
Aldus (Jess): JaeheexMCxzen route when
Bill: Well, with no Rika route and after Vanderwood, I guess OT3 is the next logical step...
Bill: `â€” When they both think that Diablo is asleep, Shera and Rem share what is initially a touching moment. Essentially, the elf considers the loli to be her precious nakama. That means friend, teammate, or what have you. This is all going according to keikaku. Iâ€™m sorry if my Japanese is poor. Gomen-na-sorry.`
Bill: I love these reviews.
Aldus (Jess): "after vanderwood" as if we're gonna get one
Nokri (Marisa): Itâ€™s daijokay what a good review uwu
Aldus (Jess): Vanderwood route is just "fuck this crazy shit, we're leaving"
Nokri (Marisa): ^
Aldus (Jess): You guys move away with new names and vanderwood keeps the house spotless
Nokri (Marisa): vanderwood route is vandy finding a phone like MC did but instead of going to a random apartment he burns the phone
Aldus (Jess): Yea!
Bill: ```â€” And just by groping one of Sheraâ€™s breast, Diablo is able to send the elf girl into a state of pure ecstasy. Sure, boobs can be sensitive, but good luck trying to give a girl an orgasm just by awkwardly fondling her breasts. Give it a shot, buddy.

â€” But we need to go lower! Get your mind out of the gutter, though. The show really just means Sheraâ€™s oh-so-sensitive belly button! Uh-huh.

â€” According to anime, the entirety of a womanâ€™s body is an erogenous zone. Touch her anywhere and sheâ€™ll scream loud enough for the neighbors to call the cops.

â€” Anyways, Diablo wussed out at the last second and was unable to finish the job. So much for an almighty demon lord. There are pills for that, yâ€™know.```
