Nokri (Marisa): some days i wonder 'when will kuragehime update again'
and then i remember
it's done. gone. finished forever. rip.
Nokri (Marisa): this manga i'm reading started out really interesting but like
now the two main guys (who are childhood friends) are dating and they were making out and got caught by their mothers and the one mother was so shocked she ran off but it turns out she's not against the sons' relationship, she's just jealous because the one mom likes the other mom romantically and didn't confess because they're both married women and now it's too late because it'd be weird
Elfriede (Tom): wait is it actually done or has the story just died?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah it officially ended. i didn't really like the ending.
Nokri (Marisa): sometimes you know an author gets tired of their work and starts rushing to finish it but they still have like 2 or 3 years of material left to write before it can be concluded. it felt kind of like that.
