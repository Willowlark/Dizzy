Nokri (Marisa): Someone lit KyoAni’s studio on fire. Current death toll is 12 and expected to rise.
Bill: it was intentional arson?
Bill: I saw the fire and injured, not deaths and arson.
Nokri (Marisa): Oh wait, CNN is saying 25 dead
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah intentional
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was just reading that
Nokri (Marisa): Someone walked in and started pouring gasoline on the ground and on people
Nokri (Marisa): He also had a ton of knives
Nokri (Marisa): https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/07/18/asia/kyoto-animation-fire-intl-hnk/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fanime%2Fcomments%2Fcemj4w%2Fkyoto_animation_studio_kyoani_had_a_fire_break%2F
Bill: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-18/fire-department-33-people-confirmed-dead-in-kyoto-animation-fire/.149102 33 dead according to ANN.
Nokri (Marisa): Every English source has differing information aaahhh
Nokri (Marisa): I’d trust ANN more than CNN
Bill: Yeah, for japan news anyway.
Aldus Larian (Jess): BBC says 33 also
Nokri (Marisa): This might be the biggest incident since the Akihabara massacre or the sarin gas attack. Way more deaths.
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49027178
Aldus Larian (Jess): the BBC article has some info on suspect
Bill: I'm waiting to find out this has something to do with a waifu.
Bill: Dark, but.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Who is the suspect?
Latest reports say the man is not a former employee - but eyewitnesses say he appeared to be angry with the animation studio.

They said he ran away from the building towards a nearby train station after the fire started but fell to the ground. Some reports said he was pursued by employees of Kyoto Animation.

"A person with singed hair was lying down and there were bloody footprints," a 59-year-old woman living nearby told news agency Kyodo.

"He seemed to be in pain, irritated and suffering, but also angry as if he was resentful. I heard him saying something like 'you copied it'," a neighbour said.

The Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted a 61-year-old neighbour as saying she clearly heard the man shout: "You ripped me off."

The suspect was injured and was being treated in hospital, so police could not immediately question him, NHK said.
Nokri (Marisa): Another article I read said he was accusing them of plagiarism
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah there, “you copied it”
But they don’t know what he’s accusing them of copying
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea and "you ripped me off"
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo this too:
Japanese media reports said a man in his 40s had earlier bought 40 litres (nine gallons) of petrol at a nearby petrol station. Two containers used for the fuel were later found at the scene of the fire, Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.

Meanwhile Kyoto Animation Director Hideaki Hatta told the broadcaster that the company had recently received threatening emails.

"They were addressed to our office and sales department and told us to die," he said.
Bill: ngl I wouldn't be surprised if they received threats weekly. Weebs are sensitive.
Nokri (Marisa): Threatening letters unfortunately are pretty common in the Japanese entertainment industry
Nokri (Marisa): Yuuup
Bill: I'd understand ignoring them to an extent.
Bill: Constantly living in fear of a reaction like this is no way to live.
Bill: Plus you'd never get any work done.
Nokri (Marisa): The only time they really do anything about threats are if they’re detailed, or if they have something in it like a powder
Aldus Larian (Jess): there were apparently about 70 people int he building at the time and its seems like all 70 were affecting in some way 😦
Nokri (Marisa): They dispatched a ton of fire trucks too. This is definitely going down in history.
Bill: 30 trucks yeah.
Bill: What's scary to me is that a handful of people died on the main floors. 75% of the dead were found in a single stairwell.
Bill: I hope it wasn't something like the door out was blocked and they suffocated to death.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jeez
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :(
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I saw too that's awful
Nokri (Marisa): Japan used to be incredibly fire prone so they’re incredibly big on fire safety there 
But it’s kind of 50/50 because a lot of places are still a huge fire hazard (especially Kyoto). People have the knowledge of fire safety but the environment prevents that (also, running for your life requires some split second decisions and there’s no time for thinking). 

I’d imagine kyoani had protocols in place in case of a fire, but not to the extent of a ton of gasoline on the ground which lights up immediately. All the exits may have been blocked as well.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea 😦 its not exactly the kind of fire you'd prepare for 😭
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah. And all the paper in the building as well. 

If you look at the video, smoke is absolutely pouring out of everywhere. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yryzSHnpdAU
Nokri (Marisa): What might have happened is as the people on the stairs were trying to get to the roof, the gas knocked them out first.
Nokri (Marisa): The windows weren’t open, they were blown out
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): (Sorry if talking about it makes people uncomfortable. My current work is disaster prevention and stuff like this is big on a global scale and an anime scale.)
Bill: Maybe better working conditions for animators can come from this.
Bill: Nah, this is fine.
Nokri (Marisa): lol
Bill: I was going to bring it up too.
Nokri (Marisa): I wonder if they’ll make a memorial anime
Nokri (Marisa): How long will it even take them to recover
Nokri (Marisa): I imagine all their projects are getting pushed back with their main studio destroyed and half their workers dead
Bill: ye, hopefully they had off site backups of the digital work.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i read that unlike alot of companys kyoani acutely pays a regular salary and not pe rframe?
Nokri (Marisa): They pay a good salary, but the working hours are likely still insane
Aldus Larian (Jess): yee
Bill: That universal though.
Bill: RT has the same thing.
Nokri (Marisa): Some companies only pay minimum wage
I’ve heard awful things about rooster teeth’s treatment of their animators
Bill: it went viral a few weeks ago yea.
Nokri (Marisa): Oo I didn’t see that, it’s a thing people have been saying for years
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/rooster-teeth-ceo-apologizes-for-poor-work-conditions-at-dallas-animation-studio-175948.html
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): They’ve cleared the building, so the death toll will only rise if the injured in critical condition don’t make it.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/cep3zd/morning_coffee_vibes_me_digital_painting_2019/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh my gof
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats so terrible
Nokri (Marisa): That’s a cool cafe picture
Nokri (Marisa): Japanese summers are hot. Hotter and more humid than ours. I’m reading that the gasoline might have started evaporated on the ground which make it more like an explosion. 

Plus every Japanese office is filled with paper on every single open space. 

I wonder how much work was lost. Archives and such.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea 😦
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): Ah yeah. It was an old building, one central staircase and that’s it. People on upper floors didn’t really stand a chance. Even if they got on the roof, the smoke and gas and heat would’ve gotten them anyway
Nokri (Marisa): Only seven people managed to escape safely. Some of them might’ve been the ones to chase after the guy who set it on fire, who’s currently unconscious with a burned leg and who tried to escape barefoot
Nokri (Marisa): He was able to buy so much gasoline because he said it was for a generator
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats so terrible
Nokri (Marisa): Doctors and nurses sedated him to make him unconscious, I wonder if they did it for medical reasons or because he’s insane
Aldus Larian (Jess): both
Aldus Larian (Jess): both is good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Another article I'm reading usssss now saying 33 dead
Bill: It's scary how effective the attack was.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i read 33 dead and 30  about in the hosiptal?
Aldus Larian (Jess): and 7 got out
Nokri (Marisa): Previous attacks have just been lucky that they were thwarted before major damages was caused. This is supposed to be the usual outcome without people to stop it. 

36 in hospital I saw
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Apparently Japan's worst mass killing in 20 years. Jeez
Bill: It's not the usual outcome if people do stop it usually.
Bill: Further comments confirm the windows were not like that.
Nokri (Marisa): Sylvia and I really recommend this book
Nokri (Marisa): The building was only three stories y’all and pretty old. In japan a lot of buildings get rebuilt every couple of decades but this one has been there since the 80s.
Nokri (Marisa): The world has changed so much in 15-20 years
Aldus Larian (Jess): yaa it looks like it was built in the 80s
Bill: 
Bill: Kyo ani apparently has 160 total employees.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i saw that on facebook 😦 apparently it was empty? hoping thats true
Bill: that's 20 percent of the company killed, and another 25 percent traumatized and/or injured.
Bill: Japan has the death penalty though. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah I saw an article saying another murderer from 2008 is currently on death row. Can't imagine this guy won't receive the same fate
Bill: 700k raised in support of Kyoani already.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oops wrong channel o well
Nokri (Marisa): i was just reading that
can't believe you reblogged something non-mystic mess, what will your followers think!?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good thing I don't have any
Aldus Larian (Jess): I reblog dragon age alot ~~not as often as mm but~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Cyute
Nokri (Marisa): KyoAni is cancelling future projects, they cancelled the next Free! movie because the show’s producer died
Bill: 😭
Bill: I'm glad they did though, rather than try and stress themselves continung.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats so sad :(
not sad they cancelled sad he died
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah, the movie was scheduled to be released next year so a majority of it must be finished already. But they have many bigger things to focus on now.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea 😦
Nokri (Marisa): Oo this is officially the biggest homicide in Japan’s recorded history. There was another fire that killed 44 a while ago that was suspected to be arson but they never caught anybody or proved it was arson so today’s is official
Aldus Larian (Jess): holy shit 😦
Bill: Something I was seeing on reddit was people just talking about the works Kyoani did and what a loss they are... It was low key bothering me. The anime isn't more important than the human lives.
Bill: I know they don't mean it that way but it's just how some of the posts read.
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah. Everyone tries to make an appealing memorial post but it doesn’t do anything. They’re just trying to take advantage of the issue.
Aldus Larian (Jess): good point
Nokri (Marisa): This would be equally devastating if it happened in a bakery, or a soap factory, or a furniture shop. But people nowadays are very detached from tragedy and don’t really understand the loss aside from “anime!”
This doesn’t affect them aside from their favorite shows get messed up. 

Not saying everyone is like this, but now is a good time for people to take advantage of kindness and hurt feelings for internet karma.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea no one would be sad at lost soap
Nokri (Marisa): I had considered making an instagram post this morning with a kyoani cosplay talking about the situation but that would’ve been awful to do, and anyone who cares has likely heard about it already
Bill: I wasn't seeing anything quite that bad. It's just people are trying to highlight the tragedy but it's about the tragedy, not the anime they produced.
Bill: So like "Oh no, it's terrible. They did such good work" but like, the compliment to their work just makes it sound like that's WHY they think it's terrible.
Bill: I'm nitpicking language tho.
Nokri (Marisa): I’ve seen some issues and fights break out. It’s rare but if you go digging they’re there, just like with all tragedy. 

Yeah, that’s a thing. Oof.
Nokri (Marisa): Society has weird values.
Bill: *They mean well but it sounds like they don't ugh*
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea it implies their lives were made important because of the work they did when in reality human life is important regardless of accomplishments
Nokri (Marisa): Somewhat unrelated, but the way people treat life is weird. Unless it directly impacts them, people just don’t care. 

There are people whose job it is to exterminate lives every day. People kill bugs and trap pests. Humans pay to murder ants and cockroaches because we value our own convenience far more than we value hundreds of cockroach lives. 

While most humans necessarily wouldn’t pay to exterminate a bunch of people, they also wouldn’t put their lives on hold for a situation like this aside from a brief “well that sucks” over morning coffee before moving on with their lives. 

And really, there’s nothing to do. We can send money, but in the grand scheme of things this is so small and insignificant. Not that the lives were lost were insignificant, but in a few days most people (aside from the ones whose lives were directly impacted, like families) will forget all about it.
Nokri (Marisa): I’m cutting myself off from typing now owo
Bill: It's like you have a degree in sociology. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: You're right.
Aldus Larian (Jess): god i think about that all the time, its so true
Aldus Larian (Jess): and the worst part is, I know I'm no different. The human condition is strange
Nokri (Marisa): That’s enlightenment baby
Bill: Archer voice: You can't save everyone Shirou
Nokri (Marisa): Funimation’s Twitter is where all the anime talk is coming from. (“So sad for them, I loved Hyouka!” and similar comments) It’s so annoying.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i guess it would be different if people were saying like "so sad for them, I met ____ at such and such event and they were a lovely person"
Bill: Yup. That's about the person, not the work.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea
Aldus Larian (Jess): then theres the whole issue of language and culture barriers
Bill: And like, it's not wrong to compliment their work either. It will stand in people's memory for a long time and I'm sure it's something they were proud of.
Bill: But right *now* those compliments just seem tastless.
Nokri (Marisa): Imma be a big neener for a moment for argument’s sake

Even comments about “so sad, I met them at such and such” are taking advantage of the situation to boost one’s own moral standing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): good point
Aldus Larian (Jess): eliminate the "i" completely is what your saying.  like
Aldus Larian (Jess): YOU (the poster) do not matter right now
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!! Even though that’s incredibly difficult to do in English
Aldus Larian (Jess): like offer condolences, comment on the sadness of the situation but dont talk about your relation to it or how its affecting you becuase that doesnt matter
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that makes sense, i hadn't considered that at first
Nokri (Marisa): English is a very pronoun-strong language. In other languages you can say stuff like “very sad” without using pronouns. In English you’re sort of forced to say “I’m very sad” or “this is very sad,” but in the latter case it still sounds funny in English unless you say “this is very sad for [person].”
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea!
Nokri (Marisa): Makes English sound very blame heavy
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~english so selfish~~
Nokri (Marisa): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm sad I missed this conversation cuz big same
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I've semi stopped killing spiders cuz of it
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And ye saying you knew someone could be taken as "you should feel bad for me cuz I knew them" but it can also just mean "this is wierd for me cuz I knew them"
El🆓de Faun (Tom): People care more about this because the anime has impacted them personally, they don't know those people on a personal level ofc but they feel like they do
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I wouldn't see most of those people as selfish or tastless though.
