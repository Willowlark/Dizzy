Nokri (Marisa): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **CUTE**
Bill: Damn son.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn he got ripped
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *yup, he sure will get it* 😏
Bill: Considering the entire premise of the series is Takagi (his wife) teases him all the time, only thing he gettin is teased.
Bill: He started doing push-ups every night, one for every time she teased him.
Bill: And he got that jacked.
Bill: (The original manga is when they’re in middle school, this is the spin off with their daughter)
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well they have a kid so obviously he gets it
Bill: Though now I’m thinking. They obviously fucked, cause they have a daughter. But in the manga he almost never gets the “upper hand”, or has Takagi beat. She always ends up teasing him or knowing what he was thinking, etc... which I... can’t quite imagine as a great mood for fuckin. 

Long story short, I wonder if they’ll ever show him get the upper hand. He could just be a sub, but there’s a few scenes in the 200 chapters where he does surprise her or act masculine and she’s like “oh.” And freezes.
Bill: Like I get the feeling he gets played all day by her but then they get into bed and he’s suddenly all masculine and the switch is a thing.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybe, although getting teased that much isn't probably healthy xD
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So who knows
Bill: It’s not.
Bill: And considering they’ve effectively been dating since middle school...
Bill: There must be another side to the dynamic for them to have worked like they did.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe he has a degredation kink
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or. It's manga so it just works
El🆓de Faun (Tom): TRU
Bill: I mean yeah, it’s a gag manga so it’s not meant to be realistic.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So it actually feels more realistic when they youngings
Bill: ^
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But that attitude wouldn't carry past like young highschool
Bill: Kids tease people they like.
Bill: It’s not the same as adults.
Tikur (Kurtis): Oh he loves the teasing, it's absolutely his kink.
Bill: There is a different vibe to their interactions as adults.
Tikur (Kurtis): And the mom gets the daughter to tease him as well.
Bill: Yeee well.
Bill: She has more respect for his feelings I think, as an adult.
Bill: But like, the author clearly must have thought about their relationship beyond “girl teased guy, she likes him, he doesn’t get it” cause he has 100 chapters of their married life.
Bill: So I just wonder about it.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): She hits him with that ara ara~
Bill: *Give me an in-depth documentary of their relationship*
Bill: Stella has Marisa energy.
Nokri (Marisa): is she a nazi
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~why she got a glass of elixir~~
Bill: It's a blue fairy actually.
Bill: Nah, she's a cat boomer.
Bill: Iirc, she had acute nanomachine rejection as a kid and the cyberpunk fic for that was cat ears.
Nokri (Marisa): then what's with the iron cross
Aldus Larian (Jess): what she from
Bill: Va-11Hall-a.
Bill: She's one of the patrons of the bar.
Nokri (Marisa): ok the wiki page says that cross is supposed to be gold but that image above definitely makes it look nazi-like
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill:
