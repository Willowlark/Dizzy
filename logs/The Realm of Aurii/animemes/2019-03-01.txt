Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I just cried for 15 mins because of the last 2 epsiodes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): No spoilers but fucking OW
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That hurt on a personal level
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no
Bill: So you can back my opinion?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yes
Bill: I don't ship white rose, but damn if the art isn't cute all the time.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): A lot of rwby ship art is adorable

Elfriede Faun (Tom): NICU
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The mirror lady yeah we saw her a couple times
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He covered the mirror in the last episode we saw
N🆗ri (Marisa): no peepin'
Aldus Larian (Jess): is it a lady?
Bill: I just have this image of her introducing herself in a college ice breaker activitiy and someone's like. 🤔 "Are you... Kanade-chan?"
Bill: And she's like "Fuck".
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yoosung "No one knows my major"
Yoosungs profile pic: *literally a picture of his student ID with his major on it*
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a mystery
N🆗ri (Marisa): No one knows ever
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not even him
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is day ten right? How’s Jumin <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): He's uhhhh fast
N🆗ri (Marisa): nyoom
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dont think seven was this even this scared in his own route XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Who would win?
Infiltrating a fanatic religious cult to retrieve your brainwashed brother 
OR
1 Zoomy rich kid?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I forgot about a thing with V in this route
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA WTF
Aldus Larian (Jess): like did seven leave him there
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~V walked in and told unknown that MC was a lesbian and he was like "sheeeet"~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Lol bye” drives off
Aldus Larian (Jess): seriously wtf 
and then seven was like "Oh yea V says he can party cuz he has the flu"
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||V can’t ever get a happy end outside of his own route he’s got way more than the flu <:lenny:395307171539189760> ||
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: || Because no one loves him ||
Bill: huh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHY WOULD SEVEN LEAVE HIM THERE
Bill: || You think there could be an AU ending where Rika like, gets help and her and V get together properly? Would that work, I don't know the canon quite well enough to say if she crossed the moral event horizon completely. ||
Aldus Larian (Jess): actually in jumins route V is a fucking star
Aldus Larian (Jess): depends on who you talk to
canonically? people would NOT be happy
Aldus Larian (Jess): people are mad enough she got a back story DLC
N🆗ri (Marisa): Rika never hugged V he said he was never hugged until MC showed up
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG i forgot about that
Bill: ye. Curious.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Rika and V are too toxic for each other I think. They both think the other is too perfect and flawless and become self destructive
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa wheres the other half of that comic <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Cause *clearly* the fandom likes Ray more than V, so the endgame where MC and Ray still get together but V isn't. The reject. Would be cool.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760> ~~idk it was on reddit hhh~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh shit lemme find it for u
N🆗ri (Marisa): Real American hero
Aldus Larian (Jess): SO far Vs route is the best ending overall i think?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait I might have it
Aldus Larian (Jess): like everyone is alive and getting help they need ~~sept jumin is an achoholic~~
Bill: ~~could be worse~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah this is the second part
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA THERE IT IS
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s trying his best ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): I hope V and seven both survive rays rout
N🆗ri (Marisa): Schrodinger’s Seven
Aldus Larian (Jess): they can be a family 🌈
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sept V is an arsonist now but thats fine
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe seven becomes what ray once was
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s fine
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yoosung’s valentines dlc
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn that 4th wall break
N🆗ri (Marisa): Mint eye vibes :3c
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like when u play the 2:00 am chats and they are like "dont play the game to late!"
N🆗ri (Marisa): “What are you doing up? Get some sleep ok!”
I.... I waited up for youuuu ;A;
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ray and Vs routes are just... wowie
Aldus Larian (Jess): playing the casual route was like a vacation
Aldus Larian (Jess): no ones bleeding, no ones getting brainwashed, no body even got stabbed
N🆗ri (Marisa): RIP seven’s baby
Aldus Larian (Jess): Since saeran is ok in Vs ending i hope v will be ok in his
Aldus Larian (Jess): then again V's happiness kinda depends on the twins both being ok?
Aldus Larian (Jess): like I dont think V would be able to have a happy ending unless the twins are both ok cuz he feels responsible for everything. so that may be why saeran survived for his ending
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ray’s route ending: everyone dies. V. Saeran. Saeyoung. Mc. All.
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): they wont do that XD they know how popular he is
Aldus Larian (Jess): or maybe they will just to fuck with everyone
Aldus Larian (Jess): ray after end: cancelled
Rika route announced
N🆗ri (Marisa): WOO
They did do that whole ideal dream scenario in seven’s end right
N🆗ri (Marisa): And then were like “HA this is a dream life still sucks for everyone”
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA basically seven route ends you get a shat room where everything is great and happy and then unkniwn enters the chat room and hes like BITCH U THOUGHT
Aldus Larian (Jess): then u have to do secret endings to get real end
Aldus Larian (Jess): does v die to save seven? i cant remember
N🆗ri (Marisa): I thiiiiink? Indirectly. Seven is chained up in the basement and V is trying to get them free or such
Aldus Larian (Jess): i thought they were like in the ritual room thing?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Time to replay
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know V is with Rika yeah in the fancy room
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): THATS ALWAUS FHE BEST PICTURE
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s it that’s mystic messenger
Aldus Larian (Jess): tfw you realise you are terrible person and killed your boyfriend who put up with all your BS and now youll be forever alone
N🆗ri (Marisa): “oopsies”
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): HE STAIN HIS SHIRT HELP HIM
