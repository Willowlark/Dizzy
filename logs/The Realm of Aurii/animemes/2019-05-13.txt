Nokri (Marisa): GO CHILDREN GO
Nokri (Marisa): for some reason i get really excited when i see the english scanlation of certain series posted, despite already owning those series and having been able to read them at any time.
Nokri (Marisa): highest praise possible to the person who picked up showa maiden fairytale after it was heartlessly dropped
Nokri (Marisa): wh
what mark. you're just staring at her chest. where did the mark come from.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i thought that was Vanderwood~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~if you cut off the bottom it make sense~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): But yea where TF does the mark come from
Nokri (Marisa): yeah he's been abducted by a cult!!! it basically is <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): don't you see? the mark....... it's right there................... such an obvious spot that makes total sense.........
Aldus Larian (Jess): No decent organization would kidnap and lock someone up <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Man at least draw a circle or *something*
Nokri (Marisa): ***but the chest.......... gotta draw it............. gotta hve it in there....... important***
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's essential to the plot
Nokri (Marisa): in ten chapters after the big reveal boy will we be glad it was there in our time of need
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Nokri (Marisa):

Bill: ```Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san kicks off with a salaryman in a depressing job working unreasonable overtime. Is this going to be an isekai anime where he gets run over by a car? Instead of getting run over and getting reincarnated as a gazebo, the loser male lead becomes the object of pity and receives a fox waifu to help him cope. The setup is the classic Belldandy scenario, which I guess would be the late 90s and early 00s way of overworked Japanese men to fantasize about better lives‚Äì Aa! Megami-sama to Mahoromatic to Happy Lesson to Mamotte Shugogetten to Chobits all captured aspects of this desire. Nowadays, isekai fills this gap.

The poor male lead is just completely beaten down and says things like, ‚ÄúThe last train home again. And I missed dinner.‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow many years has it been since I came home to a hot meal and ate with another person?‚Äù Well, lucky for him, a fox waifu‚Äì err‚Äì loli fox waifu shows up and takes care of his as both his mom and also his loli play object. And so begins the harem comedy hi-jinks, except this show is not funny. I find the show to be depressing and sad that the solution to the awful lives of these salaryman isn‚Äôt to demand change from their employers or society but to just hope one day they either meet a loli fox waifu or get run over by a car. There is no other recourse for these salaryman to improve their lives other than to be reincarnated as a gazebo. Shame on anyone who calls this ‚Äúhealing‚Äù anime. This is anime that reinforces the belief that it is better not to stir the pot and demand change and just accept your fate‚Äì the anime equivalent of Mr. Burns hanging up the ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT FORGET: YOU‚ÄôRE HERE FOREVER‚Äù sign on Homer‚Äôs workstation except there‚Äôs no pictures of Maggie to cover it up.``` <@!301927856240459777> <@!141729881779077121>  you should find this amusing,
Nokri (Marisa): Ye it ain‚Äôt no healing anime, it a moe blob fantasy anime
Nokri (Marisa): Which might be healing to some <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: I found the social commentary on the japanese work mentality more amusing.
Nokri (Marisa): Oo naw yeah that stuff is harsh and lifeless
Andrew: It really is
Andrew: I appreciate the insight here
Andrew: I didnt watch it but dont want to necessarily hate  on it.
Andrew: Where is this from?
Nokri (Marisa): omg these two chapters of the same thing are so different
what happened
Nokri (Marisa): fanservice version and non-fanservice? ?? but it's weird fanservice? i don't even know if it's fanservice what is UP
they said the author drew two versions of this chapter. and they sure did. but. why??
Nokri (Marisa): in one she bangs her fists against his chest and calls him stupid, then sits on him.
in the other she chokes his neck with her thighs???
Nokri (Marisa): these two chapters are so different, how is the story gonna continue??? i don't understand??? help what is the author gonna do
Nokri (Marisa): on one chapter we have
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): and then the author remade THE EXACT SAME CHAPTER where everything is EXACTLY THE SAME
except
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): **author what are u doin to us**
Nokri (Marisa): thanks for coming to my ted talk and putting up with my spam
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao WAT
Nokri (Marisa): THE TWO CHAPTERS ARE SO DIFFERENT

Bill: "I feel better I'm done now"
Bill: "NOPE THESE FUCKERS GETTING BITCHED ABOUT SOMMORE"
Nokri (Marisa): i am still equally as confused i have merely run out of stuff tO SHOUT ABOUT YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~This is like when you're on someone's blog and you can tell when the were horny~~
Nokri (Marisa): mangaka: "i think you'll really like what i've made this time."
editor: "yeah, this is great. it's just.... could you make it, like, more in character? less thigh strangling for the kids?"
Nokri (Marisa): this author has a very obvious style
traditional japanese girls who are small with huge chests
and their stories are usually great
Nokri (Marisa): i'm trying to find an example from the story before this one
Nokri (Marisa): gotem
Nokri (Marisa): yuzu's the perfect example
Nokri (Marisa): perfect yuzu, innocent and angelic
Nokri (Marisa): out of absolutely nowhere in a random chapter where she gets sick
Nokri (Marisa): author......................... why u do?
Bill: anime that's why.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Um
Aldus Larian (Jess): I feel violated
Nokri (Marisa): dont worry they're husband and wife i think. or at least engaged or something. she totally loves him.
Aldus Larian (Jess): But that's a child
Nokri (Marisa): also i wanna find one with her hair down
OH YEAH she's totally like 14
Nokri (Marisa): rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò≠
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is he also 14?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~plz say yes~~
Nokri (Marisa): i think he's like 16
Nokri (Marisa): older but still high school age
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh thank god
Nokri (Marisa): there's another one by the same author, girl is like 16 but her 'husband' is several thousand years old and she's the reincarnation of his wife.
still lolicon>????
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh boy...
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:regret:575787266048262175>
Nokri (Marisa): "won't it be really funny if this underage girl gets possessed and runs around town in a bikini"
<:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: ~~why are you reading ecchi manga~~
Nokri (Marisa): it's not!!!! i like the author, i used to live across from an area they wrote a story about once
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa I'm gonna need you stop reading that
Nokri (Marisa): their stories are really nice if you just gloss over the bad
Nokri (Marisa): BUT JESS
Nokri (Marisa): I NEED MANGA AND THIS AUTHOR CAN WRITE GOOD STORIES!!
Nokri (Marisa): imagine how great the first one would be if it didn't have that weird second chapter with the thigh choke
Bill: You sound like Josh Howell, saying Highschool DxD had a plot.
Nokri (Marisa): these ones do at least have plots
Nokri (Marisa): showa story has one ecchi scene in 3 chapters, taisho story has one ecchi scene in 38 chapters.
NOT BAD COMPARATIVELY
Nokri (Marisa): ~~if y'all think this is bad manga boy do i have examples for you~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): when he gets a shower she stays fully clothed üëå
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Does he get bigger boobs too?
Nokri (Marisa): i don't think so <:woah:543194447345876998>
Andrew: <@301927856240459777> what's thaler name of the manga?
Nokri (Marisa): which one <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: The first one, you know with the

"Fan service"
Nokri (Marisa): Showa Otome Otogibanashi
i recommend reading Taisho Otome Otogibanashi first tho, there are some neat little references to it here and there
