Nokri (Marisa): guess you gotta read homestuck
El氣電e Faun (Tom): I like zims spider legs
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!!! his PAK!!! technically it's part of him? if an irken loses their head, the pak can still control their body, it contains their consciousness
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Woahh
Aldus Larian (Jess): I vaguely remember that
Nokri (Marisa): it's installed on them immediately after birth and then the irken consciousness is downloaded into their body? but zim's was messed up and was missing files which is why he's the protagonist
El氣電e Faun (Tom): ZIMMMMMM
