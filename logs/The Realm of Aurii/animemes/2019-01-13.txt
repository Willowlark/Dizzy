Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): <@301927856240459777>  I remembered that I wanted to ask you out of curiosity, I know you speak really good japanese and stuff but I know you had mentioned communication issues still over there sometimes. How often did that happen? Was communication like a day to day challenge?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ねー
Hmm. The biggest communication issues was when guys (I never had the issue with a girl, only guys??) would talk oddly. Like, too quickly and not loudly enough and use extra polite language and a whole bunch of factors that made it super hard to understand what they were saying. I can deal with people talking quickly, but for whatever when I encounter these guys (who are few and far between, maybe once a month) it’s like they’re not even speaking Japanese it’s so hard to understand. 

Most stuff I could get my point across. Even if I didn’t know a word, I could explain around that word and people would understand. Like the other day I forgot the word for pincer (it’s はさみ the same as scissors) but my friend could understand because I described it as “a crab’s hand without fingers that goes like this” [pincer motion]
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Usually most people could understand me fine. A lot of people were surprised when I’d start talking and occasionally I’d get asked if I’m japanese or half because apparently I have a really good accent. People understood me well enough to invite me to dinner or parties which was lovely, and I usually had no issues at the bank or post office or city hall. 

People learning English (my customers at work) also said I had a really easy to understand English accent, so anyone who spoke some English could also very easily understand me and I could always resort to that in a pinch. 

But there weren’t really any big issues in communication that I remember aside from me forgetting words. 🤔
Dirty Lego (Tom): Awesome! It's really hard for me to understand the concept of speaking another language seriously. It's something I've never experienced and it's so different for anything else. Communication is a very specific thing I suppose, but it's really neet.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Also your accent is better cuz u a weeb <:mew_face:498866691963355137>
