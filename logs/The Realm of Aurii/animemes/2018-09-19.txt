Bill: Apparently Senran Kagura made some kind of switch grope simulator game.
Bill: Which is literally described in the article as 'feels creepy to play'.
Bill: But I was skimming and came across this gem: `While her thighs jiggle ever so slightly, her breasts can be groped, slapped, and pulled every which way. I soon developed a habit of pulling them as far apart as possible each time I entered a dream. It was less a ritual of enjoyment and more an act of self-flaggellation to remind myself of what I‚Äôd chosen to do with my time.`
Nokri (Marisa): wow how could that be creepy at all in any way
Bill: ~~you rotate the joycons to slap the titty~~
Bill: 
Bill: Anime is truly a mistake.

Nokri (Marisa): which is weird because the game is probably a japan exclusive?
Bill: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:SiBJQIxYz-8J:www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/09/17/get-up-close-and-a-little-too-personal-in-senran-kagura-reflexions+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us <= that should work for you.

Bill: ~~I love that something on Nintendo's site needs age verification~~
Nokri (Marisa): hardcore nintendo
Bill: ```Reflexions is all about getting some one-on-one time with Asuka of the Hanzo National Academy. She needs my help. There‚Äôs a feeling inside of her she doesn‚Äôt quite understand and it‚Äôs only through my embrace that she‚Äôll reach an epiphany about herself. To put it in a less romanticized way, I need to keep touching her until she figures out what's what. ```
Nokri (Marisa): *she needs your help*
Bill: The only thing I care about in anime anymore is sarcastic commentary about harem anime.
Bill: ~~can't wait till this sells over a million units in japan~~

Aldus (Jess): WHAAAT but like everyone here has it and my co work has it my data is flawed
Aldus (Jess): im looking up what Chuseok is all about cuz i had no clue and: 
Chicken Fight (Dak Sa Um)
Korean people used to watch chicken fights (Hangul: Îã≠Ïã∏ÏõÄ), and learned how chickens fought; a game inspired by such was invented.

To play the game, people are separated into two balanced groups. One must bend his or her leg up and hold it bent with the knee poking out. The players must then attack each other with their bent knees, having to eliminate them by making their feet touch the ground; the last player holding up his or her knee wins.

The game is about strength, speed, and balance; in order to stay alive, one must display the capability of fighting back.[26]
Aldus (Jess): plz tell me this is going to be in the chats
Nokri (Marisa): Get funding and do your own experiment to contest the data
Nokri (Marisa): FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
Nokri (Marisa): RFA FIGHT
Aldus (Jess): IT BETTER BE IN THE CHATS I NEED TO KNOW
Aldus (Jess): ~~*prays for chats where saeran isnt all alone while everyone has fun*~~
Nokri (Marisa): First chat is about placing bets
Last chat is arguing over who‚Äôs still conscious enough to call an ambulance
Aldus (Jess): Ssireum
Ssireum (Hangul: Ïî®Î¶Ñ) is the most popular Korean sport played during Chuseok, and contests are usually held during this holiday. Scholars have found evidence for ssireum's dating back to the Goguryeo dynasty, Ssireum is assumed to have 5000 years of history. Two players wrestle each other while holding onto their opponent's satba, a red and blue band. A player loses when his upper body touches the ground, and the winner becomes Cheonha Jangsa, Baekdu Jangsa, or Halla Jangsa, meaning "the most powerful". The winner gets a bull and 1 kg of rice as the prize.[23] Due to its popularity among both the young and the old, ssireum contests are held more frequently, not limited to important holidays.
Aldus (Jess): PLZZ
Nokri (Marisa): Zen vs Jumin showdown at last
Nokri (Marisa): Seven brings the bull
Aldus (Jess): zens wins but jumin gives him a bull and kg of rice
Nokri (Marisa): zen is like ‚Äúthis won‚Äôt fit in my house‚Äù

Aldus (Jess): aw man i cant wait
Aldus (Jess): this one has seven written all over it: So-nori is a comedic performance in which people used a straw mat to disguise themselves as a cow and call from door to door for all to get together and share food.
