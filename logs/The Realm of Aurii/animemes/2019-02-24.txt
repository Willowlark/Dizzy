N🆗ri (Marisa): am making list of manga recs
do you mind old manga or do you prefer modern stuff
there's a really good one but it's a bit dated ~~you could pretend it's historical fantasy~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): actually the art still holds up pretty well
N🆗ri (Marisa): princess tutu is a psychological thriller anime fight me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's fine!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've fallen down a princess tutu rabbit hole again. i'm pretty sure 75% of the fandom exists because of one swedish amv
Dirty Lego (Tom): I believe it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nive
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Jaehee is a Savage
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jaehee tells it like it is
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I honestly don't know if I'm.gonna get her route 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): U GOTTA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I hope so!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm trying hard to be gay
N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw no brown heart reaction
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): If not I'll prob just get a bad end and then pay the 100 hour glasses to start at day four with jaehee
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I feel like I have so many hearts from seven and idk if you get a bad end from that or not
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo ye you might get a neutral end
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think ur fine
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo whasa a nuetral end?
N🆗ri (Marisa): "hey thanks for joining! turns out we don't need a party coordinator lol bye" somethin like that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Shiiiit
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I read that if you don't do enough chatrooms unknown shows up and he's like "lol you obviously don't like this game too much"
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't remember that one
/veers off the route path to meet unknown again
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a basic rec list but most of it is historical romance. i seem to be blanking on a lot of other stuff. hmm.
N🆗ri (Marisa): anything with a + at the end of it has an anime
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait. i'll make it a *
N🆗ri (Marisa): * = anime
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo neato
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I've never gotten it myself
N🆗ri (Marisa): ``Marisa's top 5 picks OwO
Akatsuki no Yona* (u got this covered)
Jibaku Shounen Hanako-kun (a girl wants to make a wish, so she seeks out a ghost in the school's bathroom. very similar to noragami plot-wise but more psychological)
Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika nai Akuryaku Reijou ni Tensei Shite Shimatta... (Katarina. romcom with a mary sue protag)
Kusuriya no Hitorigoto (has 2 manga that are identical in all but art. one is far superior to the other. A girl who is kidnapped and sold as a laborer/poison tester in the imperial palace - solves mysteries and gets wrapped up in palace affairs)
Sgt. Frog* (i just think it's neat)
N🆗ri (Marisa): ```Taisho Wotome Otogibanashi (historical slice of life-ish romance set in early 1900s japan)
Otome Youkai Zakuro* (fox girls and military men in a magical action historical romance)
Kanata Kara (a high school girl is teleported to another world where many people are after her life)
Suijin no Ikenie (AKA Suijin no Hanayome) (a girl from modern japan gets teleported to... ancient times? another world? idk but the people there sacrifice her to the water god who hates humans)
Aoi Horus no Hitomi (ancient egypt, the author's interpretation of how Hatshepsut lived her life)
Arslan Senki* (ancient persia, a young prince with little potential is thrown into a large war and gathers some trusted allies)
Nenene (loli girl engaged to a guy in his 30s with a mask, historical japanese romcom)

```
N🆗ri (Marisa): ```The Duke of Death and his Black Maid (like, victorian england ish? A duke is cursed that anything he touches dies but he has a really flirty maid and they really like each other so they want to break his curse)
Nie-hime to Kemono no Ou (this is more cutesy. girl is sacrificed to the beast king who takes her as his wife, but beast folk are against a human queen. basically the furry version of Azfareo, which is the scaley version of this)
Princess Tutu* (psychological thriller about magical ballet and fairy tales)
Franken Fran (psychological horror-ish that poses many "what if?" questions about humanity and science)
Made in Abyss* (psychological loli adventures!! :D)
Black Butler* (psychological historical series with fantasy elements. boy is kidnapped and branded while his family is murdered, makes a deal with a demon to get revenge on the people who did this to him)
Totsukuni no Shoujo (similar to the magus bride but the girl is the only one not cursed and her teacher is cursed and just trying to give her a good life and oh grandma)
Sachi-iro no One Room (an abused girl is kidnapped by her stalker and prefers her life with him compared to her family and school, but it's not so easy living as a missing child and evading police)
```

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo apparently if I get more 707/jumin hearts than any of the other 3 I get an ending where zen has a dream they are all machines
N🆗ri (Marisa): people give black butler flack but it's actually intense and checks a lot of your boxes so i tossed it in there

N🆗ri (Marisa): him and sebastian have really passive aggressive fights though it's hilarious
N🆗ri (Marisa): sebastian just loves seeing him mess up and embarass himself
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): He gets less annoying as it goes along probably. Also the second season is anime exclusive and the anime timeline is absolutely all over the place

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That doesn't surprise me honestly
Bill: It’s common to like and romanticize villains yeah, trope is “Draco in Leather Pants”.... just never occurred to me ever Kilgrave would fall into that.
Bill: He’s pretty hard to make a decent person.
