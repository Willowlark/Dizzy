Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Noooo 😭
Bill: Sword art is stupid.
Bill: Also Durarara's second season was probs killed by the split cours.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Now she fake being ok
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): [sword art voice] no u
Bill: Todoroki would have a seduction skill right?
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): What’s popular now. Is anything popular now. I can’t think of one anime that reigns supreme here atm. OH banana fish that’s insanely popular
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Todoroki is suave
Bill: oof. All I gave him skill wise was intimidation and law.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Todoroki is effortlessly suave. He's like passivly suave. Doesn't know he's doing it
Bill: and law is a stretch.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Todoroki consciously has the seduction skill of a pile of rocks
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yona to suwon: "don't talk to me or my 5 boyfriends ever again"
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Wait only five
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Yeah five now
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Rip
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): “You has your chance”
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Had
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Double rip
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): No yeah don’t forget fire dude who thinks she’s dead
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Haven't met yellow booli yet
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): After the last episode do the OVAs because he gets so little time in main series but the OVA explains him more
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Takes it out of proper context though the manga is so much more rough and impactful
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "no one wants a girl who can't cook and clean"
Judging by all the hot dudes following her around I don't think that's true 😂
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Awww everyone cry
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): ~~that’s what yoon is for~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): TRU
Bill: oof Todoroki doesn't even have weapon attacks yet and he busted.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Don’t forget he has to regulate his internal temperature and too much ice makes him chilly or too much fire burns him up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Do you know what chapter the anime ends on?
Bill: eh, that's rather mundane a restriction.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Yeah I do. You gonna read the manga pls do
Offhand I know it’s around the 40s.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): They moved suwon vs guntae around
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): OMG THE ANIME ENDS WITHOUT THE LOVE POTION CHAPTER you gotta read that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooooooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'll probably read it ~~if I even finish noragami~~
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Again slightly out of order. I’ll get the order for you tonight.
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Do it
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): Pls I beg
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): I’ll grovel
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): An attempted will be made
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Jeno said the moon is beautiful tonight <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah that is how they are spelling it, wouldja look at that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea on the cronchroll sub it's Jeno

If you read the manga before the OVAs it might be stronger
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh damn I was way off 😂
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm so bad with names 😭
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Start at chapter 41ish to be safe in the manga. Then if it’s familiar like the tournament you can skip the chapter.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Yes these are my children. Yona and Zona.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🙏 thank
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lmao that would be pretty bad lmao
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Some arcs are a bit meh like the lushing forest arc but it gets really good after, like the xing arc.

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like ohhh should she pick the redheaded prankster or super serious heir to the company thrown? What is this, deep story?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It doesn't matter, cuz either way they're rich! 😂
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Go for German guy instead
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Plot twist

Total Nok-out (Marisa): the art is so different omg
Total Nok-out (Marisa): def read chapter 41. 
chapter 42 is covered in the anime aside from this cute picture
Total Nok-out (Marisa): 43 is mostly covered in the anime.
44-46 is the suwon vs gun-tae thing
47 is where the anime ends
so if you don't want to read what's already been covered then do chapter 41 then skip to chapter 48
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IS DAT BLUE BOI?!
