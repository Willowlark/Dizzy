Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sign me the fuck up
N🆗ri (Marisa): like girl scouts
N🆗ri (Marisa): thin mints
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thin mint -> mint eye
N🆗ri (Marisa): deliver us the truth
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Been searching around for the original (hopefully higher resolution) version of this art or Broly and Chilai but man no luck
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): do you think it's called "Mint Eye" because V's hair is mint colored and his eyes suck? 🤔
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think it has something to do with rika being obsessed with his eyes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's why she stole Saeran
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cuz he has the minty eye
Aldus Larian (Jess): he didnt have the minty eye till she stole him <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh wtf
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea they never explain it either its either colored contacts, or his eyes changed color cuz of elixir
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ELIXER HAHHAA
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Get me some man
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WANT ME SOME EYE COLOR CHANGING ELIXER
Aldus Larian (Jess): right?!
N🆗ri (Marisa): they also never explain that one person who abducts you if you fail the prologue
Aldus Larian (Jess): this guy?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
some people thought it was rika?
Aldus Larian (Jess): or just a catfish pic unknown stole from the interwebs
N🆗ri (Marisa): i haven't done the rika backstory yet but I thought maybe it's her friend/sister/whoever is in her backstory. mina or mika or such.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i have no clue
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just assumed it was a fake pic
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's probably catfish pic
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~its him in cosplay~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's him that's Cheritz
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): dont u know? hes the foriegn exchange student
Aldus Larian (Jess): wont you help him return the missing phone?
Aldus Larian (Jess): me at work pretending to be busy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh same
N🆗ri (Marisa): four new manga this week where the protagonist is reincarnated as the antagonist of a dating game, but they like a side character better than the main character <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
2/4 it's the captain of the knights
1/4 is the merchant npc
1/4 is a prince of another country
Aldus Larian (Jess): new trend? 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): purrhaps?
there are a lot more in the same genre. i think katarina was the first, or at least the first majorly successful. there's been SO many after that.
Bill: Japan is always trend hopping.
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes the girls embrace their villain side
sometimes they just want to survive
Bill: Dunno if a josei/ shoutout trend will blow up like isekai or narou but.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think this is a subcategory of isekai
Bill: Faiiiiir.
N🆗ri (Marisa): in two of the ones i've read they skip over the plot of the game completely and just begin after the events of the game, where the girl is sent away to a nunnery to the rest of her life
N🆗ri (Marisa): this one looks very promising
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh goodness
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): this author has SO many webtoons running at once is she ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): internet explorer, fox girls are better, stalker x stalker, succubus girlfriend, vampire girlfriend, chloe in japan, magickology, this new clinic comic and i know there are more.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but also they're all amazing
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa):
