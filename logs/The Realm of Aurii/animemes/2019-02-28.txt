Bill: Takagi and her daughter are so wholesome.
Bill: *hes still doing push-ups and their married it’s perfect*
Bill: Why is he embarrassed to have Takagi look at his teeth in her lap? Guy you two have a child. Y’all fucked.
Bill: Get over it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg buri you can't do this to me
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): im going to send her a very angry text message
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😱
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg noooo 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): she laughed at me
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): I saw the others too 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry u had to go through that turmoil
Bill: Reading most of moto, there’s only a few moments where Takagi and Nishikata are romantic with each other (sure, they’re in front of their young child but) and I’d like to see exactly how the non teasing part of their relationship looks.
Bill: Cause I am ALL for married couples in manga and anime cause I’m sick of dopey teens.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: *Dude your CHILD with her is on your shoulders, how EXACTLY are you embarrassed seeing her neck*
Bill: I know the point of the series is “Takagi teases, Takagi always wins” but like, this isn’t the version where they’re grade schoolers..
Bill: *aaaaaah you stupid children*

This is a weird couple than the meme that Tom and Jess *only* hold hands.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Twist is she books it and he can't catch her
Bill: Nah, daughter almost wakes up and he has to bolt back to his side of the bed.
Bill: *let them kiss god*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wait they haven't kissed? Like for the reader to see yet?
Bill: Nope. In the original they’re in middle school so it made sense, but they don’t kiss in 72 chapters of their married with kid version.
Bill: Closest they get to intimacy is messages.
Bill: Which I would say is equal parts Japanese cultural habit of reserved intimacy, they are usually in front of their child, and the author may still think of the parents as the kids from the original.
Bill: That and it’s a gag comedy, not a romance manga.
Bill: Trademark Marisa Pose ™
Bill: :lenny:
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😬
Bill: I was going to start another photoset on the train. Oops.
Bill: But I’m caught up on both manga now.
