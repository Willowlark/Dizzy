Nokri (Marisa): more reasons this series is absolute trash:
*sacrificing an anime figure in the name of cheap romance cliches that do nothing*
Nokri (Marisa): oh no a waifu figure is falling. how threatening. gotta save the heroine.
Elfriede (Tom): OMFG
Elfriede (Tom): Are you injured from this 2oz figure that I fucking blocked
Elfriede (Tom): Man what a BADASS
Aldus (Jess): What a man
Nokri (Marisa): An utter dreamboat. 
Look at the way he swats the figure away tho Iâ€™d be so mad. With all that effort you probably couldâ€™ve caught the figure and cushioned itâ€™s fall with your body.
Aldus (Jess): Was it her waifu figure?
Nokri (Marisa): no it was her brother's. not the brother in the pic who swatted it away, one of the other brothers. i hate this series why do i still read it.
Nokri (Marisa): *why is the music so catchy*
Aldus (Jess): OH its one of those
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): ~~AND I JUST REMEMBERED I BOUGHT A COSPLAY OF THE GIRL WHY DID I DO THAT~~ it was like $3 thats probably why
Nokri (Marisa): those are all her brothers.
Nokri (Marisa): the only one who isn't her brother is her pet squirrel who's human in her dreams.
Aldus (Jess): i like my idea that the girl went to a guys house and his waifu fell over and he defended her
Nokri (Marisa): good theory
Aldus (Jess): oh i think you told us about this
Nokri (Marisa): it's my hatred that i still follow for reasons unknown
I mean look at this stupid gif. it's infuriating but also hilarious because the one guy has the squirrel in his hand

Aldus (Jess): are they all adopted?
Nokri (Marisa): nope they're all blood relatives.
the girl is the adopted one ~~for legal reasons~~ her father married their mother even though the parents are never shown. there's a wedding scene where they have to go to the wedding though because then they can sell merch of the guys in tuxes. this series is super popular here.
Nokri (Marisa): the one in the dress isn't a girl it's the token crossdressing brother
Aldus (Jess): what is it called?
Nokri (Marisa): Brother's Conflict. it's a visual novel and apparently a regular novel too. there's an anime but since there are so many characters it barely gets into anything serious.
Nokri (Marisa): basically one episode per brother and one episode for the twins
Nokri (Marisa): the squirrel gets like a 3 minute spotlight in the last episode
Aldus (Jess): *looks at pic*
Aldus (Jess): twins?
Nokri (Marisa): o ye they're actually triplets
Nokri (Marisa): but one's fraternal and two are identical? but they've got different color palettes
Aldus (Jess): ðŸ˜®
Aldus (Jess): none of those bois look alike
Aldus (Jess): how are htey even brothers wtf
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): orange mcgee is the anime waifu beater
the other two are the identical twins, they're anime voice actors
Nokri (Marisa): orange boy is a game developer or something
Nokri (Marisa): he should know the importance of figures smh
Aldus (Jess): lmao
Nokri (Marisa): ANYWAY JESS LOOK AT THIS
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoeGe82AFm0
Nokri (Marisa): shiro's voice actor likes to sing
Aldus (Jess): ðŸ˜®
Nokri (Marisa): i wish the other voices had bigger parts ; A ;
Elfriede (Tom): Ahh yess 37 brothers
Elfriede (Tom): Brothers can you plz give the loops
