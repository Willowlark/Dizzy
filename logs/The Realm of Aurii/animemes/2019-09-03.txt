Nokri (Marisa): "ouchi ni kaeritai" popped up in my playlist but most of the title was cut off so it just said "up next: ouch"
Bill: Seven in drag and his dragons Zen, Jaehee, Yoosung, and Jumin.
Nokri (Marisa): [cracks knuckles]
Finally, years of training have prepared me to read this one panel of a webtoon
Bill: is let's play not japanese original?
Nokri (Marisa): ~~thatâ€™s sarcasm right~~
Nokri (Marisa): It is
Nokri (Marisa): Itâ€™s made by the woman who does Markiplierâ€™s art
Bill: Why's this in japanese then? And you'd have already read it since it's in english first right?
Nokri (Marisa): There are only 25 episodes fan translated into Japanese according to Webtoons
This is the new chapter uploaded today in English. Youâ€™d know why itâ€™s in Japanese if you read it :3c
Bill: Oh I see.
Bill: Also I'm so behind on webtoons.
Nokri (Marisa): Same. Iâ€™ve been catching up slowly, Iâ€™m caught up on maybe half of them and then others Iâ€™m really far behind like Lore Olympus and Winter Moon. I have to catch up on the new stuff too before it gets too far ahead like Little Matcha Girl
Bill: I really only care about Hooky I think, and the fact that if I open Line to catch up on that I'll feel obligated to read the rest scares me.
Nokri (Marisa): Didnâ€™t you also like Seed?
Bill: Ye
Nokri (Marisa):
