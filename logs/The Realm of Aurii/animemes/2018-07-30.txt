Nokri (Marisa): jahy-sama did her best!!!
Nokri (Marisa): character development
Bill: Should I be up right now?
Bill: No.
Bill: But I‚Äôve caught up on voltron.
Bill: I ship the fuck out of Lance and Allura now.
Nokri (Marisa): don't let people hear that, lance x keith is the big popular thing and fans of it are crazy to the point of harassing voice actors and a totally unrelated woman who had the username "klance" on twitter
Bill: So, typical gay shipping.
Nokri (Marisa): They blackmailed the actual animation crew
Nokri (Marisa): Got into into huge trouble with DreamWorks
Aldus (Jess): Who blackmailed who no? üòÆ
Elfriede (Tom): Who ships Lance with anyone other than himself?
Nokri (Marisa): a year or two ago there were leaks being released on tumblr of episodes that hadn't been released yet, and it was a Big Deal because the animation studio was under strict orders not to release anything that wasn't approved by dreamworks. the company didn't know who did it, but the person threatened that they would keep releasing leaks unless klance was made canon. i forget how it was resolved, they probably found out who it was, but for a while they couldn't figure out who was doing it and they had to either fire basically the entire animation staff or put up with these leaks and risk getting the contract severed by dreamworks, basically ending voltron.

they also tried blackmailing the real estate agent that was being harassed but she wasn't taking any of that and actually started a lawsuit, so twitter sent cease and desist letters to the teens harassing her who started going "woe is me we just wanted the canon ship name twitter handle"
Aldus (Jess): Wtffffff
Aldus (Jess): Is wrong with people
Nokri (Marisa): they need more homo
Aldus (Jess): That's insane
Nokri (Marisa): http://www.newnownext.com/voltron-legendary-defender-blackmail-studio-mir-klance/05/2017/
Aldus (Jess): I'd love to watch them try to explain to their parents why they are getting cease and desist letters from Twitter
Nokri (Marisa): "honey you're 11 why are you being sued"
Nokri (Marisa): o here's where i heard about the real estate agent

Nokri (Marisa): THE POLICE SHOWED UP AT THEIR HOMES golden
Aldus (Jess): That's insane
Aldus (Jess): So I started playing mystic memes again last night but when I started another story again it gave me the option to skip the common route which I never do cuz I don't wanna spend hourglasses but it only gave me option for V and im low key nervous ray won't be available for some reason
Nokri (Marisa): Did you pay hourglasses for ray? :0
Nokri (Marisa): Did you unlock his route? You can skip the common route and start at someone‚Äôs route only if you already completed that route so maybe you only see V because you finished it
Aldus (Jess): well now you get them both for 300 instead of purchasing them secretly
Nokri (Marisa): Oooooooo
Aldus (Jess): OOO ok maybe thats why i though you could skip common for anyoone as long as you did one
Aldus (Jess): also when i opened the game it though i was in the middle of play through and it was like "you have 300000 missed called" (exaggerating)
Nokri (Marisa): time to call everyone back
Aldus (Jess): *gets to day 4*

Aldus (Jess): i love how the game hints at jumins bdsm kink think but whenever you pick those answers they either go over his head or he's like "im srry, why are you talking like that?"
Bill: *hints*
Bill: though, what would you expect him to say that won't lead to a R rating?
Bill: X?
Bill: R?
Bill: whatever porn has.
Aldus (Jess): lmao i mean he could be more like "i like that" or something it wouldnt be r rated but i like the idea that the fandom thinks hes a kink daddy but hes actually just a big man baby who need a hug
