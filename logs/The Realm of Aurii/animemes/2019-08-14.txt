El🆓de Faun (Tom): Now that's def 3 d rivht
Nokri (Marisa): It looks 2d, though the face is a little wonky
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t think it’s 3D? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe rotoscoped?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Thats some serious rotoscoping damn
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Just the way the hair is flowing looks like it could be 3d
Nokri (Marisa): ye i don't know what it is that makes things look 2d or 3d but there's usually a big distinction between them. that gap might get smaller as textures and models improve

El🆓de Faun (Tom): I feel like the outlines look different a bit and the output quality goes up but damn that's impressive
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If I wasnt looking for it I wouldn't have noticed
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Demon slayer I've noticed a few times, they use a lot of 3d
Nokri (Marisa): it's how they slay the demons
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Sometimes during fast motion during fighting it looks good but occasionally when they are far away if look clunky
Nokri (Marisa): yee, berserk is a great example of that. clunky animation aglore 🌟

El🆓de Faun (Tom): NO WE DONT TALK ABOUT BERSERK AHGGHH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah hopefully beastars is good
