Aldus (Jess): Vs voice actor ended it with "Rika.... I hate you" they acted out a senario of the characters coming to Otakon where they play off unknown as a cosplayer
Aldus (Jess): Ray's va said "jaehees my idol"
Aldus (Jess): It was the most wholesome 2 hrs of my life
Aldus (Jess): Also look at this sticker
Nokri (Marisa): Kawaii omg
Jaehee is everyone’s idol, they mentioned in commentary once that she’s super like her character and is the best
Rip rika
Omg the unknown cosplayer thing sounds amazing 
“Who are you cosplaying?”
[takes out gun]
Other characters: “hahA THATS A PROP”
Aldus (Jess): Seven was like "he's kinda cute, like me!"
