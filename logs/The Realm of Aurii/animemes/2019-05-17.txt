Nokri (Marisa): technically it's passing water between dehydrated people who don't have a bowl/cup which then turns into a kiss
Nokri (Marisa): for 3 pages
Nokri (Marisa): which may be a way to appease the fans because ||last chapter ended on a cliffhanger with yona passing out and confessing to hak who already confessed like 50 chapters ago. that was such a good chapter, it's even fully voice acted on the drama CD||
Nokri (Marisa): shoutout to the peanut gallery sitting off to the side just reacting to everything

Elfriede Faun (Tom): I knew Yona was really a harem show <:thinku:543194478614413318>
