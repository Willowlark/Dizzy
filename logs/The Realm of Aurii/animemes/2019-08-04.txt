Nokri (Marisa): they just don't make anime like they used too
Nokri (Marisa): 50 points to gryffindor if anyone can guess the song in my head

it's from a classic anime
harem genre
aired early 2000s, manga is from the 90s
Nokri (Marisa): shounen harem not reverse harem, so it's ecchi but not hentai
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Thats a pretty wide pool
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Girls bravo
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo, really good guess but no
Nokri (Marisa): Youâ€™ve got the era and genre down pat though
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Damn
Nokri (Marisa): Think more famous, award winning
Nokri (Marisa): freaking romance is back <:rise:582318089228648456>
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Chobits <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): no but i watched this immediately after chobits in middle school <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): also was it our room that was talking about chobits at otakon?
how could we forget about DearS
it's exactly chobits but they're aliens and more ecchi
Nokri (Marisa): this isn't what the song stuck in my head is from, i'm just angry about DearS erasure

ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): H2o footprints in the sand
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): And yeah that was our room

ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Good luck
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Love Hina!
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH THAT'S IT
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): WOOOO
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Was gonna guess shuffle next
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Oh and freezing maybe
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Freezing was too late
Nokri (Marisa): i like freezing just because there used to be a news article written by some lady complaining that she was making christmas cards with her kids and when she googled "freezing" to get some clip art, naked anime girls showed up
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): YEAH
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I remember that for some reason!
Nokri (Marisa): just like this

Nokri (Marisa): https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-04/kazuyuki-okitsu-joins-cast-of-my-hero-academia-anime-as-fat-gum/.149681
Nokri (Marisa): he's got really good range. he did a good job as yuki in ouran with guns, he does hatori in fruits basket and vincent in black butler so he'll probably have a really heroic voice. i wonder if it'll switch between fat and skinny versions.
Nokri (Marisa): wAIT HE WASN'T YUKI HE WAS MIDORI
Nokri (Marisa): ok he's just gonna sound sadistic
Nokri (Marisa): Hozuki, Bonbori, and Ganryu appreciation hour
Nokri (Marisa): omg they were genderbent
Nokri (Marisa): so that basically proves that all men are in the military and all women are half-spirits who wear traditional clothing
Nokri (Marisa): wow there really isn't a lot of fanart for these guys are there
Nokri (Marisa): sad!
Aldus Larian (Jess): What dis from? ðŸ˜®
Nokri (Marisa): otome youkai zakuro! i've been thinking of rereading the manga, there's an anime too
Nokri (Marisa): there's basically 3 ships in the show and they're all great
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i don't remember how far into the manga the anime gets but it was made at a time when the anime covered a significant amount of story

Nokri (Marisa): it's kiiiinda a mix of inu x boku, ouran, kamisama kiss, and spice and wolf
