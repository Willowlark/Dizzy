Nokri (Marisa): o december 14th
Bill: So. I mentioned we bought a NAS, or Network Access Storage. The thing is fully loaded with software, including a media server.
Bill: It does a hell of a job with anime. Some missing audio, some missing subs, but I've never had streaming software handle the files so well.
Bill: It can run Plex, which has better subtitle support, and the missing audio was from 10-bit encoded video (which was a mistake to get anyway) so hopefully I can just go through my anime drive like it's netflix.
Bill: #mistake
Aldus (Jess): Was <@301927856240459777>  here?
