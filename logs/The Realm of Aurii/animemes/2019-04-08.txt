Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mars fawning over an Elon Musk body pillow killed me xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): I didn't even realise Rika girl was litteraly "the sun"
Bill: Mary poppins reboot: they push the dad‚Äôs sister and her romantic interest down the road sharing a bicycle all cutesy
Mary poppins: watches
Mary poppins: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough of that‚Äù
Mary poppins: leaves
Bill: Mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mary Poppins: the anime
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: This picture is invalid MC says she loves V.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like that V's handle is "vblind"
Bill: Why is doctor eggman in bnha.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why not
Aldus Larian (Jess): When tumblr color codes your tracked tags just right üëå
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Blargh, Seven stop being sad üò≠
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also the security system was just terminated so that'll be fun üôÉ
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *the suspense is killing me*
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good luck my fren
NüÜóri (Marisa):

Bill: Ah yes. Red.
Bill: ```‚ÄúHow many fingers do you do for never have I ever?‚Äù Sun asks when Yang finishes. Yang makes a face.‚Äù

‚ÄúI start with seven, everyone else starts with five, and shut up.‚Äù Yang says, sounding sour. Weiss snickers. It was a necessary rule change, the only way to keep Yang from having to drink every time a ten was pulled.‚Äù```.
Bill: The college AU fic is amusing.
Bill: But beehaw
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Too many, Saeran. Too many.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What a MOOD
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have no clue what this is but i wanna redraw it with seven
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): "how to hack your way to a six pack"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: *But where's the sauce*
Bill: *asking for a friend*
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk man, gotta ask seven
Bill: ```In [7]: me = Body(0)

Look at my 6 pack!```

*Look I did it*
Aldus Larian (Jess): did it work?
Bill: *look I did it*
Bill: *What do you think*
Aldus Larian (Jess): def worked
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): A mood‚Ñ¢
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone help him
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone help *them*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): wel seven the first thing you need to go is turn off the monitor that has the camera feed from mcs apartment
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's so creepy my god
Bill: Nothing says hot like *always watching you*.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think technically the camera is outside the apartment like in the hall
Aldus Larian (Jess): or not! who knows
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it's in a hallway in the apartment
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea cuz i remember seven being like "come wave to me" in his route or something like that ~~and also that he looks at mc every 2.63 seconds or something~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol yup
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): "dont judge us Jaehee"
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: Oof.
Bill: I get that tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): THERE IT IS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~swoons~*
Bill: I thought she couldn't leave the apartment.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think she actually can?
Aldus Larian (Jess): HA haha
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just not when ||the bomb is active||
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea she can sometimes idk its weird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She left to rendezvous with Driver Kim to bring her to Zen's aprtment in Zen's route
Bill: I like how this has to be questioned, because it's TOTALLY normal for a girl to just go to an unoccupied apartment and stay there for 10 days.
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe she got evicted that morning
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that hasn't been lived in for 2 years
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe her roomates a pain in the ass
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): with whatever food *may* have been left over
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Me, playing MM*
Bill: MM would be super cringy genderswapped.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I wanted to see if there was a floorplan for Rika's apartment and I found a fan made one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but the data they collected to put it together is really amusing
Bill: share I love floor plans.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Via phone convos with Seven (and common sense etc) during his route, it can be deduced that there is:
- A kitchen (fridge, stove, cupboards) with a coffee machine somewhere

- A washing machine (at least) in the same general area

- A bathroom of some sort (or else how will MC go pee and poo and shower?)

- A dining table to eat at

- Shelves for books/other Rika keeps at the apartment

- A window for Saeran to break through
Bill: *That is the only use for the window*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol right?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao that is the only use for the window
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://aminoapps.com/c/mystic-messanger/page/blog/just-me-trying-to-make-sense-of-rikas-apartment/dw1X_5QsbuL5L0XdwYXJL1R7deBzXPqp1m
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not gonna read all the way through because there are definitely Seven route spoilers, but...
Bill: I'm.
Bill: Bored.
Bill: Almost bored enough.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but the window thing made me laugh xD
Bill: To actually *download MM*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/starwars-star-wars-episode-3-3o84sw9CmwYpAnRRni
Aldus Larian (Jess): he just likes to be extra
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly I could see Bill downloading it and buying a shit ton of hourglasses to just unlock all of the chats in one go and just play through in a day
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~like hal did~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~pfffft~~
Bill: Excuse me, Hal's too broke for that shit.
Bill: Can I actually do that though?
Aldus Larian (Jess): he is but he did it anyway
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah you can unlock the chats ahead of time with hourglasses
Bill: ooooh, I thought you could only catch up on missed chats, not advance the story.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): costs like 50hg each chat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so it'd get hella expensive probably
Aldus Larian (Jess): the best part about saeran always breaking the window is they have him do it in his own route too just to reference him doing it in the main story XD
Bill: except if I started now I'd have to buy half a dozen chats from overnight.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmmm maybe like 4 or 5
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok so it would got you about $138 real human dollars to do one full playthrough
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): without waiting for chat rooms
Bill: ~~though the callout was right, I'm not stressing this I've no qualms about spending 60 bucks~~
Bill: Full playthrough being?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): to buy enough hourglasses to unlock 11 days of chat rooms
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): full playthrough = 1 route
Bill: that doesn't sound right... I thought I looked this up before...
Aldus Larian (Jess): üò±
Bill: Oh, apparently that 50 HG buys you the entire day of chatw.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i think you can buy it day by day
Bill: https://miyumint.com/2016/09/12/the-cost-of-mystic-messenger-a-guide-to-making-the-most-out-of-your-hourglasses/ if you're super fucking hardcore about it, you can buy the game through another story for 2000 HG.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nicu
Bill: I don't think I'd want to straight up binge the game like this though.
Bill: ~~or at least, my boss wouldn't want me to~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oooh
Bill: Yeaaah you have the buy day thing as buy chat.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought it was per chat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's significantly cheaper then
Bill: ye.
Bill: ,... huh.
Bill: So you don't miss a chat until the next chat opens right.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): correct
Bill: from the looks of it... When I'm going to work, I wouldn't miss the 3am chats.
Bill: I get up at 5, the next chat I'm seeing for most of these lists is around 7.
Aldus Larian (Jess): theres ussually onely 1 between midnight at 7am
Aldus Larian (Jess): sometimes 2
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I'm realizing now that a lot of the 3am ones you can so when you wake up so it's just a matter of staying up or waking up for the 1am-ish ones
Bill: https://miyumint.com/2016/09/12/the-cost-of-mystic-messenger-a-guide-to-making-the-most-out-of-your-hourglasses/
Bill: all chat times.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i use chat timing guide every playthough to figure out how many chats ill miss at night
Aldus Larian (Jess): then i just buy therm back in the morning they are only 5hgs in main story but in another they are 15hgs
Bill: Huh. 10 chatish a day, 50 to buy the days chats. That‚Äôs pretty fair.
Bill: Chertiz always struck me as such.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Speaking of Saeran believing through the window...
Aldus Larian (Jess): IT WINDOW TYME
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THERE COULD BE A FUCKING OPEN DOOR
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And this bitch
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Would still use the window
Bill: Time to break a window in your unknown cosplay Tom.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): it doesnt matter if the door is open the camera is still there which mean seven would see him
Aldus Larian (Jess): but you right that bitch would still use the window
Aldus Larian (Jess): what seven ding now üëÄ
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): getting worried about a noise he thought he heard
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): meanwhile Vanderwood broke the coffee pot
Aldus Larian (Jess): wait a noise at his house? or through the phone
Aldus Larian (Jess): i really gotta replay that route
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): its the voices in his head
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): twin telepathy
Bill: Huh. I had to put in the name during sign up, I went with a default for me which is Lily...
Bill: I just realized that sort of is a play on my own name, just the second half of the name.
Bill: Never thought of that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): cute!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wililliam
Bill: Wilma would be the most direct and oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no
Bill: MC too cute to be called Wilma.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wonder if that really was supposed to be a reference to twin telepathy <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): could have went with Billie
Bill: That a tomboyish name and MC not Tomboy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): why not?
Bill: True.
Bill: She a blank slate.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Possibly! Because it was right after this
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~thats so coo~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://aminoapps.com/c/mystic-messanger/page/blog/twin-telepathy/3po8_JZSBuMb5aMNxWmPMLPPNJ0rqRXka
Aldus Larian (Jess): well damn
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also I like how Saeran says he's going to "delete" Luciel
Aldus Larian (Jess): tfw you been on your computer too long
Bill: he's just that much of a trash.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like that death note scene
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://gfycat.com/importantonlyafricanjacana
Aldus Larian (Jess): the funny part about them throwing in the twin telepathy thing is that the biggest theme for that is "knowing when the other is in pain or in trouble" like guess it was just broken up to that point XD
NüÜóri (Marisa): BIRU'S PALYIN MTYSTIC MSe
Bill: is... there a PC version?
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah dandelion and nameless are on steam
NüÜóri (Marisa): 
Bill: Also... I‚Äôd probably skip all the common routes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm really liking 7's so far
Bill: The ones I've been interested in are V, and then Jumin.
Bill: Like. Jaehee is a lie, Zen is a narcissist, Yoosung is ~~all I deserve~~ trash...
Aldus Larian (Jess): D:!
Bill: Jess, Early 2018: "Zen is best boi"
Marisa: <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
Marisa: *slides Ray route across table*
Jess: "Zen who"
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~opps~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i would recommend playing jumin or seven before V but i know you wont listen so
Bill: No, I agree.
Bill: The only reason I brought up skipping common routes cause I wanted to see if Marisa would flip a shit at me for doing so, cause I'll miss too much of something or other.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I skipped Jaehee
Bill: Sounds like I can skip them without too much trouble, and go to Jumin/Seven.
Bill: Seven's the obligation route, cause canon... V cause I want some goddamn V content to use other than "I'm blind and no one loves me", and Jumin cause <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): when you say common rout do you mean skipping straight to day 5 or skipping the casual routes?
Bill: Casual routes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): OHH ok yea i figured you would
Bill: common route the term from Little Busters, the last VN I did.
Bill: Yeeee I just don't see the point.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I did Zen, Jumin, then Seven
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like the important takeaways are how each of the characters are connected to Rika
NüÜóri (Marisa): Here to yell at your for skipping common routes
Bill: Which I have the general jist of and lol I've spoiled most of this game already.
NüÜóri (Marisa): You have to complete one anyway to get to deep route
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea and each character is interesting on their own, and gives you more insight into how they behave in others routes too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yousung is her cousin
Rika was a fan of Zen and invited him into the org
Jaehee ???
Bill: Yeaaaaah I don't know Jaehee either.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Biru: not interested in guys
Also Biru; doesn‚Äôt want to play the one female route <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Jaehee got encouraged to join by jumin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I mean, neither did I...~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù hehe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol "encouraged"
Bill: I'm not interested in guys.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think Marisa's right though you need to play one casual route to unlock deep
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she literally says "Mr. Han forced me to join" xD
Bill: I'm shipping MC with the guys I associate with. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): not positive though since i wasnting paying my way
NüÜóri (Marisa): And then you might need one deep route to unlock another story idk tho
Bill: You have to pay to go straight into either deep or another.
Bill: But you can.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i dont know how paying works
NüÜóri (Marisa): Oo fancy
NüÜóri (Marisa): Give money get goods and services
Aldus Larian (Jess): right? insane
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://i.imgur.com/9Y8p7.gif
Bill: Me, 7am: *I gotta work on my impulse spending
Bill: Also me:
Bill: This approach is called the ‚ÄúEA‚Äù approach
NüÜóri (Marisa): You‚Äôre like my friend Teresa. I got her into mystic mess and two days later when I saw her again she had finished two routes and was almost done her third
Bill: I'm not planning on blowing through the game... It's no more cost effective to buy everything up front than play catch up on chats, so I'll do it at leisurely pace.
Bill: Just. Not staying up till midnight for chats.
NüÜóri (Marisa): You can call everyone!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but those are the best chats!
Bill: *But before we start, how do I get the bad end where Unknown kidnaps me*
NüÜóri (Marisa): Refuse to cooperate with him
NüÜóri (Marisa): ‚ÄúNew phone who dis‚Äù
Aldus Larian (Jess): you just say "there no keypad here" and shit like that
Bill: *Tom, kidnap and ravish me*
Aldus Larian (Jess): and then hes like "really bih, cuz u lookin right at it"
Bill: that cg in the opening video was V trying ot save MC from posessive Jumin wasn't it. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think?
Bill: if I switch apps during chat room it won't crash the chat will it?
Bill: IE, to share screen caps?
Aldus Larian (Jess): veeeery rarley min will
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): this one?
Bill: *and what religion is that HMMM@*
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, pro tip, as long as you open a chat room (and don't close the app) you won't lose it if the next one opens
Bill: *exactly what a creep would say*
Aldus Larian (Jess): yup! as long as you are already in the chat its fine if the next one opens
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have litterly opened up chats the min before the next one and then just left my phone on
Bill: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm creepy, I‚Äôm hot‚Äù
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats him! dont worry
Bill: WOO creepy music
Bill: ~~V?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin?
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH wait
Aldus Larian (Jess): does seven call vanderwood his assistant?
Bill: AU where MC gets her hair dyed white with pink highlights, wears punk clothes, and starts kidnapping people with Unknown.
Bill: rip chat history doesn't let you replay bad ends.
Bill: How can I catalogue the lot of them.
NüÜóri (Marisa): O history doesn‚Äôt let you play bad ends? It should :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, that cg of V is from Yousung's route
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: genderswap but neat.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Vanderwood is Seven's "maid"
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaa i thought maybe he has called him both. i guess its jumin hes referring too then
Bill: Why dont you try breaking and entering?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah wasn't Saeran jealous of Jumin for something?
Aldus Larian (Jess): man just tryina do his job ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea? kinda? he like resepcts him or somethin
Bill: No difference
Bill: their reaction is basically like when someone joins an old irc server.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "whomst is this??! AHHHH"
Bill: oof. How did you like Zen, he's the token dick who comments on every typo.
Bill: *I can relate*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My favorite part is when everyone is like "Be careful what you say with this mystery person here" and then Yoosung is like "HERE'S A SELFIE OF ME! :D"
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think it was more about how interested Zen is in MC
Bill: it is ALSO just like irc how they end up on a different topic mid interrogation.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): "least unfavorable"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ray sees through everyone bs
Bill: Answer to 'hacker': VVVvvvvvv, there's a stranger hereeeeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): more likely Rika told him that but
Bill: Start: "Oh shit it's a hacker, gunna call teh cops
Seven: "It's a girl"
"Welcome!"
Bill: K, new V meme is owning locked things but having no way to get into them
NüÜóri (Marisa): Respecting privacy juice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven: ~traces her phone and digs up her personal info~ "She's cute!"
Yoosung: "Let me see!"
Seven: "Nah, gotta respect her privacy"
Bill: MC, looking around: the entire apartment is decorated in mint eye advertising materials, Ray is in the corner crying, cult robes everywhere
This is fine
Aldus Larian (Jess): no V ITS NOT THATS WHY EVERYTHINGS A MESS <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: ‚ÄúBut V, Rika is dead‚Äù

‚ÄúMUST HAVE WANTED IT‚Äù

New meme #2
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg the best part of another story is when jumin says hes gonna cosplay V
Bill: *fucking V is like 'hey she broke in, why not give her a job?'*
Bill: *I have a job (presumably) you dumb fuck*
Aldus Larian (Jess): hes not wrong when he says Rika wanted it
Bill: But no one else knows that.
Bill: V: Suggests something ridiculous
Someone: Points out common sense
V:
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh, he knows
Bill: ~~I know, yes, she's not dead~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Secret man
Bill: i... dunno if I just got a heart, but it flashed by REALLY fast if I did.
Aldus Larian (Jess): What color?
Bill: couldn't tell. ^^;;
Bill: Maybe it was something else. I have the speed pretty high rn.
Bill: NO WAIT Imma ravish Tom apparently
Bill: *Then how bout I leave the fucking apartment then kthx*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Don't touch anything. Just stand in the same spot and don't move for the next 11 days*
Bill: YUP
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Don't even touch the floor*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *There are pressure sensors that will set off the ~~bomb~~ security system*
Bill: THERE IS
Bill: JUMIN HAN IS GAY
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not even worth answering that
Bill: glad you memorized it.
Bill: ~~god I wanna pay one of the 14 year old MM girls at a con to come up and ask you that, so you can answer in character~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I did after realizing I didn't have a proper response at Zenkai when someone asked "Does Jumin Han is gay?"
Bill: I think that blur from before was a Zen heart.
Bill: Purple for Jumin ey?
NüÜóri (Marisa): ‚ÄúAll press inquiries must go through my assistant.‚Äù
Bill: ~~you're a secret agent and you have a facebook?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Purple is Jumin
Red is Seven
Green is Yoosung
Yellow/Brown is Jaehee
White/Gray is Zen
NüÜóri (Marisa): How else can he run zen‚Äôs fanpages
NüÜóri (Marisa): Pure white is a glitch heart that they sometimes forget to remove
Bill: ~~I keep thinking Elizabeth the 3rd is judging me~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): She is
Aldus Larian (Jess): She is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven: YOU'RE IN DANGER! DON'T MOVE! I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU! YOOSUNG TELL JUMIN TO CONTACT V
~leaves~
Yoosung: If Sherlocking were here he'd have everything figured out
MC: Can I have his contact info?
Y: To invite to the party? Yeah! I'll tell him to email you!
Bill: I apparently got 7 hearts, I saw three.
Bill: oops.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): new headcanon: MC copes with life-or-death situations by event planning
Aldus Larian (Jess): V was Sherlock on the Halloween CG
Bill: ~~can I leave Zen on read~~
Bill: Only one chat room listed, for 3:00...
Bill: Do I not get to buy back the day 1 chats?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea they gone
Bill: >.>
Bill: Also I can't click on anything in chat history.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hmm that's weird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You mean this chat history?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or this one?
Bill: latter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe because you haven't completed any routes yet?
Bill: hmmm...
Bill: I guess? I figured I just did the prologue...
Bill: ~~because I'm an MC I have to say I haven't eaten everytime right~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I always say I have
Bill: oh well I guess.
Bill: So long as it shows up eventually.
Bill: I think if I do the continue right now, I unlock all of Day 1...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes I think so
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and yeah, someone will usually ask if you've eaten every day in chats near mealtimes
Bill: *FUCKING RIP* it doesn't do the morning ones.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh, yeah no only the ones after your current one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): day one isn't missing out on much tbh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): usually just everyone trying to flirt with you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which route are you doing?
Bill: *REALLY? Nooooo*
Bill: Jumin.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's fine I started my first playthrough at like7pm
Bill: I can always get them another time ye.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's really not that big of a deal
Bill: Wouldn‚Äôt have bought today‚Äôs chats tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaaa
Bill: Rip actually working this afternoon.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Me, all day today
Aldus Larian (Jess): me, all day, everyday
Aldus Larian (Jess): the suspense in sevens route is too much to able to work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I really should close out Discord on my computer and turn off notifications on my phone
Bill: *should*
Aldus Larian (Jess): you only got an hour
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I don't want to miss out on conversations
Bill: Yeee I got a half hour 45 before I yeet, I couldn‚Äôt care at this point.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): BUT YEAH SHIT'S FINALLY STARTING TO GO DOWN
Aldus Larian (Jess): is he still on his way? üëÄ
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah he just grabbed his equipment and yeeted
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Vanderwood is being attacked by the fire breathing robo dog
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO I forgot that
Aldus Larian (Jess): SOON
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *37 minutes till next chat*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I know I don't know everything about the "canon" story lines so I don't know how feasible it would be, but I still think it would be neat if they could figure out a way to make an anime. Like pick out the most canon bits and then everyone else has their side plots
Bill: It's probably not going to notify me for the new chats either...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): if you unlocked the rest of today's, it shouldn't need to?
Bill: No, but I wanna get used to that.
Bill: I'm not planning on buying all the days.
Bill: Just the missed stuff.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Except Day 2 of Deep Route should say 11:50, not 11:05
Bill: Anime would be like Amagami SS, basically 5 episodes to each character's route. The common section would be glazed over quickly with variants between them, and 3/4ths of the runtime would be for the individual character route.
Bill: Each 5 episodes would be stand alone.
Bill: Then they could do a second season for true believer, 5 to V, 5 to Ray, and 2 to like, idk Rika.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or make it direct-to-video and make it CYOA style as you watch
Bill: I've never seen anime do that tho.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or just animate all the story mode parts
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> check me.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *that's why it would be unique!*
Bill: unique is a risk in anime tho.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Mic check one two
NüÜóri (Marisa): I think an anime would go with seven‚Äôs route since he‚Äôs the ‚Äúcanon‚Äù bachelor, but incorporate some important bits of the other routes as well
NüÜóri (Marisa): Or we go all steins;gate and time keeps resetting
NüÜóri (Marisa): Another story would be an OVA
Aldus Larian (Jess): reset thoery üò≠
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven's route but at the same time Jumin and Zen are dealing with their Sarah/Echo Girl side plots
Bill: That's how lots of VNs do it.
Bill: They have the problems all happening at once.
Bill: The hard part is how she's stuck in the apartment for some routes but leaves for others.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i would love to see MM animated, but i feel like the game makes it feel so much more personal and immersive. id vote more for animated sections of the game
NüÜóri (Marisa): The Yoosung/V dispute episode
The zen‚Äôs play episode where Jaehee tries to get time off to see it and Zen is worried about his performance 
The Elizabeth escape episode
NüÜóri (Marisa): It‚Äôd be similar to how otome game anime are like Brothers Conflict and Diabolik Lovers except Better
Bill: Are those closer to Kanon or Amagami?
NüÜóri (Marisa): Hmm. Probably closer to Kanon but otome game adaptations give all characters an equal chance in the spotlight. What‚Äôs that god one I forgot to finish I wanna go back and see the one god.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Kamigami no Asobi
Bill: Kanon gave all the girls screen time.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'M 3 MINUTES IN AND I'M CRYING https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo5yrS8Gt7k
NüÜóri (Marisa): But didn‚Äôt kanon also have a canon girl
Bill: Though they stayed pretty independant of each other during the routes.
Bill: ~~Doesn't MM~~
Bill: *Sayuri best girl*
NüÜóri (Marisa): Yeah but most otome game adaptations dont focus on the canon boi if there is one
NüÜóri (Marisa): They usually rework the script somewhat to have one episode focus on each boi (because there‚Äôs like 15 of them) and then yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG ERIK IM DYING
Bill: these are amazing.
NüÜóri (Marisa): ~~have y‚Äôall not seen that series before <:lenny:395307171539189760> ~~
They have many gems in the other videos too
Aldus Larian (Jess): no lmao i do not frequent the youtubes
NüÜóri (Marisa): what do you listen to music on :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): spotify
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg i gotta stop im get in trouble
Bill: ~~is this why you cosplayed the the idol outfit from kyoukai no kanata? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
NüÜóri (Marisa): there's a specific one i'm looking for but i can't find it

Bill: ‚ÄúYUP SHES DEAD. WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED.‚Äù
Aldus Larian (Jess): see thats why she went crazy she didnt get to post all her aesthetic phone pics to her insta anymore
Aldus Larian (Jess): V: "Rika, your not a photographer just cuz you take pics of flowers on your phone and put a filter on it"
Rika: "WHAT DID U SAY BITCH. I'LL BLIND YOU!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://lochnessies.tumblr.com/post/184041228469/kyoblackharu-i-see-this-gif-and-i-think-of
Aldus Larian (Jess): heres the drawing so u dont have to click da link
Bill: I need to be a better looking V cause the meme content is building.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: Literally. No one. Would worry about V so.
Bill: Mm doesn‚Äôt work on subways. Rip.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you just want no one to love to further perpetuate your false assumption that no one loves you since you identify with him <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: ~~sssssh~~
Bill: *Don‚Äôt dissect me so harshly*
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/55sx3FG.png
Bill: !tsun
Bill: ~~I‚Äôll take love tho?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: Do I do these chats, or read my rwby fic. Hard choices.
Bill: FUCK
Bill: We should have done that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OMG IT'S HAPPENING EVERYBODY THAT FUCKING CALM
Aldus Larian (Jess): ITS HAPPENING
Aldus Larian (Jess): Spiderman meme in MCs apartment

Aldus Larian (Jess): V's**
Bill: Touch√©
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üò≠
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:mood:543191222127296522>
Bill: Is that what you call it Jumin :lenny:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Isn't the next thing Zen says "Bingo" or something lol
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: Oh man tho. I definitely still associate with Jumin.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: That me.
Bill: Except not.
Bill: It‚Äôs. Kinda easy to get hearts for everyone.
Bill: Yikes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea it's extremely easy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yup
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also if you hav more zen/jaehee/yoosung hearts then jumin or seven you get a bad end
Bill: Yikes.
Bill: Can‚Äôt check can you?
Bill: Also I might have to amend my V meme. No one loves him ROMANTICALLY, all the guys have adoring respect for him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no you can't check
Aldus Larian (Jess): So Erik how u doin
NüÜóri (Marisa): biru whose route u goin
erik hows seven
Aldus Larian (Jess): Juju!
NüÜóri (Marisa): oo he started in deep route?
NüÜóri (Marisa): freaky
Bill: Jumin.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye he cheat
NüÜóri (Marisa): goin' for the gold
Bill: ~~I‚Äôm probably going to get a bad end~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like on purpose?
Bill: Not the kinky ones either, the one where you friends zone yourself.
Bill: TT
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh rip
Bill: I‚Äôm exaggerating how many hearts I got for the others but Jumin wasn‚Äôt in a lot of the chats day one.
Bill: So.
NüÜóri (Marisa): channel your inner girl
Aldus Larian (Jess): You'll be fine you ha e 3 more days
Bill: Ye.
NüÜóri (Marisa): "ye" he says as he's finishing up day 3
Bill: Nah.
Bill: I don‚Äôt like binging the chats tbh.
Bill: I wouldn‚Äôt have bought today‚Äôs if I didn‚Äôt think it would have given me early chats.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's more immersive if you dont
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: I‚Äôll buy the ones I miss, that‚Äôs all.
Bill: I just can‚Äôt be bothered to set alarms and shit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea that's what I do!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I only set alarms sometimes like one of the 3AM chats in Ray's route has a really important call after ward that I didn't wanna miss
Aldus Larian (Jess): But <@301927856240459777>  warned me ‚ô•Ô∏è
NüÜóri (Marisa): the only thing you really miss by missing chats is party invitees. 
*looking at you, 2am jaehee route invitee i can never seem to get.*
Aldus Larian (Jess): And calls!
NüÜóri (Marisa): CALLS YEAH
NüÜóri (Marisa): LOLOL Championship Host (@creamroll). my one mystic mess weakness.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): I got that one!
NüÜóri (Marisa): WHAT
NüÜóri (Marisa): WHAT
NüÜóri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I buy my chatrooms back
Aldus Larian (Jess): With hgs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven is sad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he's busy reconfiguring the security system
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa üò≠
Bill: It‚Äôs. Showing me chat rooms for 2nd day?
NüÜóri (Marisa): did you continue? :0
NüÜóri (Marisa): i think if you hit continue it unlocks chatrooms for the next 24 hours
Bill: It‚Äôs 24 hours, not the day?
Bill: Makes sense actually...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooOOOoo
Bill: I see. It bumped me to the same time next day. So I got the notifications for the newly opened chat room at 6 on 2nd.
Bill: Rip I have to binge more chats then.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo neato
Bill: *and because I didn‚Äôt realize this I already missed a chat what*
Bill: And something isn‚Äôt filled in cause it‚Äôs ‚Äústory mode‚Äù.
Bill: Ffs.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye you have to do story mode before going to the next chat
Bill: Ohhhh makes sense then.
Bill: also fuck they talk about rika a lot.
NüÜóri (Marisa): they miss her
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because she was really great
Bill: *was she*
Bill: Okay I feel better now that chat was just jumin so I picked ‚Äúcat‚Äù every time and got 7 hearts.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like the number or the person?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's really not that difficult. as long as you can figure out how to get the hearts of the person you're aiming for, you shouldn't have issues *not* getting the bad ending
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I aim to get as many hearts as possible from everyone except the person I don't want to get
Aldus Larian (Jess): You can took up route tips too or a full walkthrough of you are really worried
Bill: Nah. You get hearts for praising Elizabeth the third in OTHER chats like.
Bill: That helps.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea! You'll get hearts for people that aren't there
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like I've gotten a lot of Seven hearts when he's not even in the chat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR-SCqcMaPk
