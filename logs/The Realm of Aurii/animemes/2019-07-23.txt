Nokri (Marisa): just like the show
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Aww that's nice

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Beautiful
Nokri (Marisa): can i ship them in a non-romantic way
all the relationships in this show are so complex
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:rise:582318089228648456>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There's the kinda shipping where you'd like them to spend the rest of enternity together
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Thas valid
Nokri (Marisa): they do
Nokri (Marisa): ||i'd ship them and they end up living together but she's a literal duck and he's human, and she spends the entire show pining after somebody else and he hates her/is super suspicious of her for half the show||
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ||fuck she a duckk?!||
Nokri (Marisa): omg what a crossover
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ||and oof that's rough||
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Woa

El🆓de Faun (Tom): That 90s
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Blingee too oh man
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh damn blinger
Nokri (Marisa): the added bling in their eyes
Nokri (Marisa): it's a great show, a dude falls out of a window without pants on twice
Nokri (Marisa): also like 80% of the fandom exists because of this exact video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9197GTl1ASg
Nokri (Marisa): the show is a fairy tale and ||when the characters realize that they're in a fairy tale they start trying to take down the author and make a happy ending for themselves, because otherwise their story ends in tragedy||
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OMG
El🆓de Faun (Tom): they sword fight?!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *hold me*
Nokri (Marisa): oh yeah some of them do
Nokri (Marisa): the townspeople are sometimes animals and nothing is weird about that

Nokri (Marisa): fgdhfgjuki thESE NEED TO END
Nokri (Marisa): actually wait that might have happened in the show. it's been like 10 years since i've seen it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg
Nokri (Marisa): before ||he knows she's a duck|| she sneaks into his room sometimes because he's bffs and roomies with the guy she's madly in love with
Nokri (Marisa): and he's like "oh sweet a cute duck"
Nokri (Marisa): ||he cries in front of the duck and spills all his inner turmoil because the duck is a friend who listens, and then he finds out his annoying classmate is the duck and his first thought is "omg i can't believe she saw me cry"||
Aldus Larian (Jess): Scandalous <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
