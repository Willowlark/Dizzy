Aldus (Jess): i hate sharing tumblr links cuz you never know what your gonna get
Nokri (Marisa): is a fun gamble
Nokri (Marisa): THE TRUTH COME OUT
Elfriede (Tom): lmao
Elfriede (Tom): good point
Aldus (Jess): Friggin Chertiz is looking for volunteers to help at otakona and they're basically gonna pay you in MM merch like wow
Nokri (Marisa): *noooooo*
Nokri (Marisa): those usually pay very poorly
*but still*
Aldus (Jess): They are looking for Cosplay volunteers I've missed my calling
Nokri (Marisa): cheritzzzzzzzzzzzz
Nokri (Marisa): aaaaaaaaaa
Nokri (Marisa): there's another company that does that. ACParadise I think? they always put casting calls for cosplayers to promote their booth at cons
Aldus (Jess): Ooo maybe! Idk
Nokri (Marisa): those booths usually pay minimum wage though üò≠ and that isn't enough to buy much
Nokri (Marisa): though it depends on the booth
Nokri (Marisa): one at zenkai had its set-up team get delayed last minute so they didn't have enough people to help set up in time for the con, and it was one of those big staple booths u see at every con. they asked for some free staff to help out and compensated us like $10 each
Aldus (Jess): Oh yeah I mean I probably wouldn't have signed up cuz I am nit good with da people but yea
Nokri (Marisa): but u'd be purrfect
Nokri (Marisa): but ye it be tiring
Nokri (Marisa): ~~but u'd be famous!~~
Aldus (Jess): I wonder if you are supposed to be in character for those things ü§î
Nokri (Marisa): ye you gotta be 100% in character
Nokri (Marisa): otakon did a sailor moon scavenger hurt with volunteer cosplayers and dang they were spot on but i hate sailor mercury now because it took me 3 hours to find her
Aldus (Jess): Oof I mean 707s like one of my favs to cosplay cuz I can kinda sorta be in character but damn
Aldus (Jess): I'd probably be best at being V. I'll just constantly apologize and be vague about everything that should work
Aldus (Jess): Shit I forgot to post to insta
Nokri (Marisa): OMG
Nokri (Marisa): you're cosplaying V
Nokri (Marisa): and like
Nokri (Marisa): "ghfjh krrrrrrrrr oh sor-sorry 
the connection is bad here you're breaking up"
Nokri (Marisa): and you just walk away
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Nokri (Marisa): or like "I have to go i'm losing connection"
Aldus (Jess): That would be perfect
Nokri (Marisa):
