N🆗ri (Marisa): Let’s go
N🆗ri (Marisa): new yona chapter out today and it's tearing me apart
N🆗ri (Marisa): 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): D:
N🆗ri (Marisa): YOU GUYS ARE TEARING THIS FAMILY APART
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ok so this looks like they are getting married and there's just a giant pile of Ferrero Rochers
N🆗ri (Marisa): "i left u for 3 years to have a self crisis but i think i'm ready to commit"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he had to get all those chocolates!
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmaoo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): VERY IMPORTANT
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have about 660 hourglasses do you think that’s enough or should I drop Jaehees route and start farming now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont even know how much itll cost
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive watch all the after ends on youtube
N🆗ri (Marisa): Seven’s was expensive, the secret one cost a couple hundred
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): including the secret end with commentary buy some girl who pronounced "Saeran" as "Saiy-re-ann"
N🆗ri (Marisa): Vs ending has different routes too. Hear
:0
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh nOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): Autocorrect made the capitalization funny
N🆗ri (Marisa): Funky
N🆗ri (Marisa): Asaaaa
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i was like "plz stop"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like you can literally hear seven saying "sa-ran" and shes like "saiy-re-ann"
N🆗ri (Marisa): During the Steven universe season finale the only livestream at one point was by a kid with a camera pointed at their TV and everyone in the comments was shouting at the kid to be quiet because they wouldn’t stop talking
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean i ussually say say-ran so i guess im not better but
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea the whole time i was like "gurl shut up"
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think I say it as “seiran”? Or sehran something like that
Gotta replay rays route now to hear it again
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its like with two soft as i think?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like in sevens after end hes like pleading with him and hes like "sa-ran-ah" which from what I read the "ah" is like an honorific you would use for someone who you consider your equal?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): secret end* whatever you wanna call it
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee the honorifics. I can vaguely recall Rika’s pronunciation of it 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): Zein’s pronunciation is weird
N🆗ri (Marisa): Zen
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): of saeran? i cant even remeber him ever saying it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i like when they say "pwi" (V)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): rika says everything so breathy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i remember them putting "nim" at the end of seaeans name too but i cant remember who does it
N🆗ri (Marisa): One of the best calls ever is Yoosung and zen and one of them is drunk and the other is trying to get them off the phone
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe Yoosung? 🤔
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think by then end of his route alot of them use it which i guess would make sense
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "-nim (Hangul: 님) is the highest form of honorifics and above -ssi, but is still used as a commonplace honorific for guests, customers, clients, and unfamiliar individuals. -nim is also used towards someone who is revered and admired for having a significant amount of skill, intellect, knowledge, etc. and is used for people who are of a higher rank than oneself"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): by the end there pretty much like "whoa your smart" so i guess that would make sense
N🆗ri (Marisa): 707-nim
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LOL
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can see someone calling him that ironically as a joke and then later being like *he is a nim*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): honorifics be cray
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like i miss alot about how the characters see each other because i cant pick them out alot
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah that makes me curious about the Korean version
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like in the childhood flashbacks seven uses "ah" but saeran uses "hyung"  which mean saeran sees him as his older brother but seven doent see saeran as his "younger brother" i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): Time to learn Korean
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): guess so
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s probably like Japanese where younger siblings call their older siblings onii-chan/onee-chan but it’s weird to call a younger sibling anything but their name or a nickname
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a respect thing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oooo yea your probably right
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but like they are the same age
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nah they several seconds apart
N🆗ri (Marisa): Big deal
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what if the whole time saeran is the older one
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and he lerans and hes just like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~Saeran will be the older brother if seven is really dead~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NOOOOOOOOO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sometimes I wonder if they had a plan for that cliffhanger or if they just YOLO’d it and are frantically trying to come up with an ending
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like they did that with the whole game
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like another story just feels like an AU
N🆗ri (Marisa): It is an AU~!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean it is
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i wonder if ray existed in the regular timeline?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like they added that personality for another story along with anger boi
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz unknown doesnt quite feel like suit searan ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah they’re all a bit different
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): buy one get 3 free
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "-ya / -a
-ya or -a (Hangul: 야, 아) is a casual title used at the end of names. It is not gender exclusive. If a name ends in a consonant -a is used (e.g. Changsub-a 창섭아), while -ya is used if the name ends in a vowel (e.g. Jihye-ya 지혜야). -ya / -a is used only between close friends and people who are familiar with each other, and its use between strangers or distant acquaintances would be considered extremely rude. -ya / -a is only used hierarchically horizontally or downwards: an adult or parent may use it for young children, and those with equal social standing may use it with each other, but a young individual will not use -ya or -a towards one who is older than their self. "
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo ok so yea it would rude for searan to use "a" cuz hes 10 seconds younger
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i guess
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): youd know more than me
N🆗ri (Marisa): I only know Japanese stuff
that ten seconds makes a world of a different wow
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wowwie such a lil boi
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): does a litte pause button on a webtoon mean its on hiates?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): I love yoo and boyfriend of the dead are on hiatus today <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: 
Bill: Dorian has idea am happy. Kill that cat.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nooo the cat is innocent
N🆗ri (Marisa): I found video of an old vocaloid concert that’s so cool. They break out of the screen above the stage and land on stage as holograms that’s so clever.
