Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: üëå
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: It's almost like you like Yona or something, can't put my finger on it.
Aldus (Jess): you summon mawisa but creating a summoning circle out of sewing supplies, chocolate, yona, and mm
Nokri (Marisa): just yona will work ok <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
I bought Hello Kitty stamps today to mail in postcards for this month's yona contest
Aldus (Jess): ooooo neato
Bill: Did you do everything Konata tells you to do for mail in contests?
Nokri (Marisa): i have to decide which drawing I want to enter first hnnng
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): "what stamps do you want?"
[ignores flowers and buildings and normal ones} hello kitty
Aldus (Jess): KYOOT
Aldus (Jess): i want hello kitty stampls
Nokri (Marisa): they look like stickers they aren't even square but they're legit stamps it's kind of weird
Aldus (Jess): im still using some mary and baby jebus stamps from chirstmas
Nokri (Marisa): praise it
Aldus (Jess): the nicest stamps i ever had were like some flower stamps for the wedding, i wanted custom ones but they were legit like 1.25 a stamp
Nokri (Marisa): omg that's enough for international postage
Aldus (Jess): right? and each invite need 2 cuz you need one for the rsvp to be returned
Aldus (Jess): so i was like NOPE and went with just regular flowers
Bill: how many people mailed back RSVPs?
Aldus (Jess): like 3/4?
Bill: *Omg tomorrow we see Lizi and Brandon and can coo over their engagementttttt~*
Bill: 3/4ths, or '3 or 4'?
Aldus (Jess): 75%
Nokri (Marisa): just 3 or 4 hehehe
Aldus (Jess): maybe more, we had alot of them
Bill: I'd have thought less.
Bill: Feel like it's easier to text a rsvp back.
Bill: hehe. I know why you didn't give me at +1 at first; I'm married to you guys, I didn't need one. üòÇ
Aldus (Jess): alot of people didnt get plus ones, we could only invite 100 people withouth the price going up
Bill: mhmm, I remember. I'm teasing since we've apparently been married at some point.
Aldus (Jess): alot of the people that brought their SOs asked me if they could? which i told them after final count id lat them know
Aldus (Jess): wish i had said know to toms brother and sister though, since both their exes are in the pics from the reception
Bill: lets be real, a +1 would have sucked anyway. I'd have had no one to invite, no one important enough to bring to a wedding (for the ex reasons) to start with, and it would have bummed me out a bit that I failed to bring a date.
Bill: Not having one was a blessing in disguise.
Aldus (Jess): also they would have ended up at some random table since you were at the head table
Bill: *Tru!*
Bill: So trust me, no salt there.
Aldus (Jess): coo <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I said no salt Marisa.
Nokri (Marisa): fixed
Bill: üôÑ
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: they in Slytherin üòè
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Bless creayus
Aldus (Jess): of course they are
Aldus (Jess): Im trying to convince my coworker to watch voltron
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): But what if I had travelled back in time to yalls wedding and convinced Bill to have me as a plus one _with no one knowin me yet_
Bill: üôÑ
Bill: You'd have had an invite already.
Bill: ~~because if you went back in time to meet us you'd just causal bump into us at Kotoricon and we'd have friended then~~
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): But the butterfly effect would mean that I could also fuck everything up
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): It's safer just to jump back to watch the mawwiage
Bill: Like we'd not be friends.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): _yes you guys could hate me_
Bill: Trust me, that wouldn't happen.
Aldus (Jess): idk man she WAS a homestuck
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: At kotori? Idk the timeframe for the homestuckage
Bill: I think that predates homestuck.
Bill: But she was in fairy tail that particular Kotori, so we wouldn't have known.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Nah that's doesn't predate homestuck, homestuck was on the rise our senior year
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: That kotori was like year 2 of college or somwthin
Bill: Nah, it was the last year we did Kotori.
Bill: 2016.
Bill: I didn't start photography till then,
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Ah yee
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Unless she was late to the homestuck game.im thinking homestuck came first
Bill: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Bill: Homestuck lost it's power by then.
Aldus (Jess): ~~it wasnt suppoesed to be that in depth~~
Bill: I MEAN, *could* we be friends with an active homestuck?
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: You were
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Kinda
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Leneah
Bill: that'd be questionable.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: And ..... Kait?
Bill: Kinda friends is the correct term. Cait.
Bill: Were they face painters tho?
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Coby? I think I unfriended them
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Idkkkk
Bill: whatever.
Bill: I do love how your friends with multiple people you met through me who I've completely lost touch with.
Bill: Leneah, Angelica...
Bill: üòõ
Bill: Though, Leneah likes my stuff on instagram occasionally.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): You guys are friends with Marisa :V
Bill: She's retired homestuck, same as you.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: *Not if you ask her*
Bill: *The point* is we'd be friends with Georgia whenever we met her.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: YEE
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: but how can you knowwww
Bill: I have faith, I don't need to know~
Dave: https://i.imgur.com/ZtrwruF.gifv
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Damn, impressive
Eliran (Halim): I see the chat about the marriage and Georgia's time travel
Eliran (Halim): Don't fek with it y'all
Eliran (Halim): Best case scenario, everything already happened, and we'd be stuck here anyways 
Every other scenario includes a paradox or splitting of timelines that means for us who are experiencing this timeline, Georgia never comes back, and we get to be super sad
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: üò± üò± üò± üò±
