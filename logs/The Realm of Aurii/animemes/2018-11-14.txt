No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i still really wanna cosplay this who wants to join
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'll see if courtney is still up to be the main character
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i wanna be the girl on the right i love her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What dis
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Watashi ga Motete Dousunda
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's about an overweight girl who's a total fujoushi (otaku who loves yaoi), and her favorite anime character dies so she locks herself in her room for a week without doing anything and when she comes out she's suddenly super gorgeous
it's really funny
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): her weight isn't played as a joke, she repeatedly gains and loses it over the course of the show and they do a bunch of "would you still love me if i'm fat" stuff

the issue is she doesn't like any of the guys who like her. she wants the guys to fall in love with each other.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg. ðŸ˜‚
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): biru did you maybe mix up owari no seraph and bueibu?

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh i hope not
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): have you seen boueibu?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nu
