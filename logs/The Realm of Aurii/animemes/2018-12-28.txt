Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): **POOR WHO**
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): **ROLO**
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): **HE IS TRAGIC**
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): **ahhh**
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): lelouch is being super friendly with him there tho
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): ***You right I suppose but ahhhhh tried to kill shirly and nunnaly***

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Tried and succeeded<:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): **NOBODY LOVES HIM**
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He stab
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): aww poor rolo
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): kind of sad that clamp never put geass into tsubasa or holic
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): As a meme?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): no no as a cameo or something
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Hey it showed up in Hayate tho somehiw
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Tsubasa Chronicles and to a lesser extent xxxHolic use all of CLAMP's series ~~except for code geass~~
do you know about tsubasa chronicles?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Nah I haven't heard of that one only holic
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the main characters in Tsubasa are Sakura and Syaoran from Cardcaptors, but older and in another world. Sakura loses her memories and they have to go world-hopping to regain them. A bunch of characters from CLAMP series make appearances in different worlds, like Chii from Chobits is in one of them but she's not a robot.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh wow
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): No I had no idea
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's really cool. like how space patrol luluco crossed over into little witch academia/kill la kill/inferno cop/a bunch of other trigger series. this goes into every clamp show *except code geass*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): There's absolutely no basis for that ship in the show but hey that's how we roll
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): EXCEPT GEASS
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): HOW DARE
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the first episode of tsubasa should be watched with the first episode of xxxholic because they're the exact same episode but from 2 different perspectives and it's really neat
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I KNOW RIGHT
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): geass rarepairs
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh really? Are they supposed to be the same series technically
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~suzaku projecting his love for euphie on someone else with pink hair~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): they're very closely related. the witch in xxxholic makes a deal with tsubasa's syaoran and allows him to travel between worlds. they're from different universes originally but somehow syaoran makes it to the witch, i can't remember how. or maybe it was fai who made the deal. but the witch gives them one of her mokona (one of a pair) and they keep in touch.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Who did this
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Not sure if supposed to be reference but it neet
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): oh ye! that first one is a crossover with overlord and the second is granblue fantasy
