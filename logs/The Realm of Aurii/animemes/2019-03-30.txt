Bill: Does chunnibyou actually exist in Japan to the level it does in anime <@!301927856240459777> ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm <:thinku:543194478614413318> probably, seeing as it's huge in the US too
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it has its own word in japanese
Bill: I mean. Anime takes a step or two farther than anything ~~I saw~~ in the us.
N🆗ri (Marisa): kids be crazy
Aldus Larian (Jess): What dat
Bill: Eighth grade syndrome.
Bill: Where a teenager is basically playing pretend 24/7. Usually something like “dark warrior of the 7th realm” and running around in fingerless gloves during the day.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like a phase?
Bill: Pretty much.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the japanese equivalent of kids who think they're wolves or half vampire or part demon and act all "dark and mysterious" when really it makes them look like huge nerds
Bill: Equivalent implying they don’t also think they’re half vampires and the third guardian of hell.
N🆗ri (Marisa): slight variation in western and japanese demon stereotypes but yeah US kids are getting closer to the japanese variation as they get weebier
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you reading komatsubara
Bill: No. They had a chunni in SNAFU and I’m rewatching that.
Bill: I need to stop thinking about “do they exist here” *cause I’m remembering eighth grade and proving the point really fast*
Aldus Larian (Jess): They def do
Bill: That. *Gill*. Yeah. What a loser he was.
Bill: >.>
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do i lenny react multiple times
Bill: You unlock it by burying the knife in my chest.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Gill?
Bill: I forgot about trap kid. I don’t like him, he’s like in the wrong anime.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is that the kid from the anime?
N🆗ri (Marisa): you know. gilliam.
Bill: Gill? No.
Bill: Or by another name, Gilly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): gill worm
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ohhhhhh <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Damn her whatever that is under her shirt cause I’m really curious. Necklace? Fancy tank top? What?
Aldus Larian (Jess): That rope tying shit
N🆗ri (Marisa): a myster
Aldus Larian (Jess): Portable noose
N🆗ri (Marisa): wednesday's pigtails are nooses in the new addams family poster it's neat
Bill: *Yui into some kinky stuff huh*
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Hikigaya has a black T-shirt on under his white uniform top and I’m like what.
Bill: That’s going to be super obvious under the shirt.
N🆗ri (Marisa): not with anime logic it isn't
unless he becomes a girl in which case anything under the white shirt becomes super obvious
Aldus Larian (Jess): Who's Yui?
Bill: The orange pink haired girl.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo
Bill: And I give props to the studio for a bunch of little details in this show. While the ~~trash~~ chunni was rolling around on the floor for a bit gag, Yui and Hikigaya stood up and moved their chairs. Yukinoshita goes to whisper an insult to Hikigaya and, while there’s no romcom between them he blushes slightly as she does cause she got close to him. Then he unblush right away cause he’s not a giggling idiot near a girl like most anime guys.
