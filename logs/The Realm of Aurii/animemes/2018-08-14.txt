Nokri (Marisa): they needed people in omiya for august <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
assuming i get fully booked i'll get an extra $20 per day woohoo. that'll cover my travel expenses. ~~but if i'm not fully booked or someone cancels I won't get reimbursed~~
Bill: Which sounds like too much of a risk girl.
Nokri (Marisa): ye but i was too awkward to tell my boss no
Nokri (Marisa): i didn't want to work 12 hours i tried to sign up for 10 and he was like "you get paid more for 12"
Nokri (Marisa): omiya has an animate that'll sometimes be open after work owo
most days i'll get there before it's open and leave after it's closed but *some days i can look at anime*
