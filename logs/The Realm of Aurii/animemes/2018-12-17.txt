Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Thanks haruhi
Bill: The last visual was *clearly* made the last visual to appease tumblr right?
Bill: Just the fact they ended on that particular still.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh I didn't even think about that 😂 well, it didn't work
Bill: Glad they did what they did, even if I don’t need more sad romances.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It was... Okay lol
Bill: Better than what tumblr wanted.
Bill: ~~season was definitely a wreck tho~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): it was ... okay
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean I wouldn't say it was *better*
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): your hatred for tumblr runs deep
Bill: It’s not that hate the ship. I just don’t see the ground work for it to be canon.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lol I didbt see groundwork for what became canon either but 🤷
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): What’s the ship is it Klance?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): do youwanna have it spoiled :3
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That becomes canon?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I haven’t seen it yet
I wanna know the canon ship
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Are you sure?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): theres 2
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's Lance and Allura
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): shiro and kurtis
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ok I can see lance and allura. Definitely not a tumblr thing, tumblr loathed it
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): *everyone lothed it*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Curtis**** god Tom get it right
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): listen i only know the one and only kurtis
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Who’s Curtis is that a new character 
Lance and allura was part of the original Voltron
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I don't *loath* it. It just came eout of nowhere
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Klance was the big tumblr favorite, it started literal lawsuits and so much drama
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): yeah theres no basis for it
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): so it was a big oof
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): There’s some
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m not supporting it or denying it but I can see it
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): *some* yeah
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): but how it goes down
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): youll see
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like on one episode they go from nothing to "I love you forever"
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): its so fast
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like oh, ok.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): They did that with allura and lotor too
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): There was more evidence for lance and allura than allura and lotor when they kissed lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Really? I could have sworn they took a few episodes of them at least hanging out together and stuff
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like alone
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Not that I recall? Or they did hang out but it seemed very platonic and “just pals doin science” sort of way imo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I guess it could have been taken either way?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Do we get to see Pidge in a dress
I know that probably destroys her character but I thought it’d be neat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nah 😔
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We do get her acting like the OG pidge which is great
Bill: The ENTIRE season is rushed tho.
Bill: And full of shinanigans.
Bill: Like a poor mans Gurren tbh.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I thought the more recent seasons were oddly paced and very little happened. It’s like they forgot they were only getting 8 seasons, or hoped they might get more. But also 8 seasons in 2 years is no easy feat
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I was hoping for more destruction
Bill: Oh and Shiro’s husbando is an actual character?
Bill: I thought he was just some dude.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea he's on the ship
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): His dead boyfriend was in another episode
Oh did he not die
Bill: ~~there are so many characters I’ve lost track of them~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea he died, that was Adam
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~biru go read homestuck~~
Bill: They kept bringing back villains and they’re like “old man Jenkins it’s you!” And I’m like “who is this and why does he have a key to the ship?”
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Jess did you ever get to chapter 100 of Yona or did you drop it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh I didn't drop it I'm just slow AF
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): That ok!!! You are not slow you must be watching a lot of anime
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that must be it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Yo bookstore dude is THE MAN
He let me buy Yona 3 days early because I’ll be out of town on release day and also gave me free cat stuff
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Wow Yona is so good. We get copious amounts of decapitation and internal struggle but also Yoon in a bunny outfit in the same issue
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): V important
