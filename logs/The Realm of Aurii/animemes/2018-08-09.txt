Aldus (Jess): Lol I don't think being a lesbian is a kink
Nokri (Marisa): wot this

Bill: your SO doing someone else, apparently.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~I’m gong back to bed~~
Bill: pfft
Aldus (Jess): Oh well then
Bill: I needed a good shoot name for MC x Unknown, since Jess and Tom going to do that at Ota.
Bill: ~~then I decided to expand the joke to all of them~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~mawisa noooo stay up I have to talk about da route~~
Nokri (Marisa): Hewwo I’m here to chat about the route owo
Aldus (Jess): Okay! Cool so I just got da pet where jumin and the intelligence unit are gonna work with saeran and 👌

Aldus (Jess): YES
Aldus (Jess): I love how he broke through the window to get you out like lmao like why this boi always breaking windows
Aldus (Jess): At least I'm assuming that's what happened?
Nokri (Marisa): Gotta be sneaky and sneaky around to escape by breaking out the window
Aldus (Jess): Then I'm going to confess my love for you in the garden for like 5 mins immediately after even though they are chasing us
Aldus (Jess): "call me whichever name you perfer" like wait what
Nokri (Marisa): saerayran

Aldus (Jess): I was like like "rip seven"
Elfriede (Tom): JUST OPEN IT DONT BERAK IT YA ANIMAL
Aldus (Jess): Gotta be dramatic
Nokri (Marisa): changes personality

Aldus (Jess): Lmao I think they just took off his jacket thingy
Aldus (Jess): Cuz he had a white dress shirt under that
Aldus (Jess): "glad you got your 3 hours of being a coma, time to work all night again"
Aldus (Jess): i also like the "i know just promised jumin i would work on saving my brother with the unit but i had to go outside to get you a flower i saw earlier"
Nokri (Marisa): "he's gonna have to work all night without rest"
"hey i was taking a leisurely stroll, what are you up to?"
Aldus (Jess): "searan plz your brother could be dead any min"
"BUT MCCCC FLOWERS!"
Aldus (Jess): lol srsly i dont think searan has slept a full night his whole life
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): *i didn't even miss any chats what is this*
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus (Jess): sometimes it doesnt tell you earlier ones  until the app resets
Aldus (Jess): 6 new messages holy butts
Nokri (Marisa): gets a text message
"You've been visited by the fairy of luck! send this to 5 other RFA members in 5 minutes or else!"
Aldus (Jess): LMAO
Aldus (Jess): that would be amazing
Aldus (Jess): OH did it do the day 11 glitch? mine does that alot on day 11
Nokri (Marisa): it said rika entered and left a chatroom when really it was saeran
Aldus (Jess): yea mine did that too!
Aldus (Jess): i was like "dat not funny bae"
Nokri (Marisa): I SPENT 10 HOURGLASSES ON A CALL AND THE CALL I JUST GOT NOW IS THE SAME CALL CHERITZ PLS
Aldus (Jess): OH NO
Nokri (Marisa): i'm suing cheritz
Aldus (Jess): yea thats what the day 11 glitch does! thats what i call it at least

Nokri (Marisa): OH NO
Nokri (Marisa): it's party time
Aldus (Jess): ah yes... party
Aldus (Jess): OH NO V
Aldus (Jess): V NO PLZ

Nokri (Marisa): did you get the pearl chat
Aldus (Jess): YEA OMG
Aldus (Jess): jumin and his red silk undies OMG
Nokri (Marisa): screaming
Nokri (Marisa): and V's quip at the end BOY
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): *v why do you know that*
Aldus (Jess): v you are blind, how can you see they are silk>
Aldus (Jess): ~~he touch~~
Nokri (Marisa): v better have taken a picture of that
Aldus (Jess): *runs back to mint eye, kicks rika down the stairs, swings v over my shoulder and tuns back away*
Nokri (Marisa): *v we need your picture of jumin in his underwear you can't leave us*
Aldus (Jess): ITS A WORTHY CAUSE
Aldus (Jess): i can never get the way rika and v say each others names out of my head. "drikaaa" "pwe"
Nokri (Marisa): yeah, someone else had a really weirdly pronounced name too 🤔 i can't remember it. i think zen? when they say his name it doesn't sound like zen
Aldus (Jess): ooo i never noticed that 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): jumin is kind of bad at english hehe he says "happy april fools day" a bit oddly
Aldus (Jess): low key worried imma go to the MM panel and be like "shit im so bad with accents"
Nokri (Marisa): they'll probably have a translator!
Aldus (Jess): OH THANK GOSH
Nokri (Marisa): at last year's gameshow with the japanese guests they had a translator but it was really cute when they tried to use their own english
Nokri (Marisa): all out of country guests get a translator even if they don't really need one, juuuust in case
Aldus (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): also the more you hear an accent the more you get used to it, so it might take a minute or two if they do try to speak english but it'll get easier to understand. all of my students are like "what did you just say" when i first greet them but then get super used to it quickly
Aldus (Jess): i think i miss alot becuase of not understanding korean honorifics in MM
Nokri (Marisa): i don't think they use them very often. hmm. jaehee definitely does with jumin, and i think i've heard nim and a?
Aldus (Jess): like i picked up that seven and searan use -hyeong for V
Nokri (Marisa): orly?? that's really neat
Aldus (Jess): yea and searan uses it for seven too
Nokri (Marisa): good boi
Aldus (Jess): and everyone says searan-a it seems? like i thought that was just the way they pronounced it but why we was saying his own name he didnt use it
Nokri (Marisa): lets see if anyone on the internet has answers
Aldus (Jess): i think i read something about that one on tumblr
Nokri (Marisa): oo in the korean apparently they put an honorific after MC's name in the text chats
http://umeyuri.tumblr.com/post/153441007024/hello-i-ran-into-your-post-on-the-translations
Nokri (Marisa): yoosung calls rika noona
Aldus (Jess): what do they even say when mcsname comes up?
Nokri (Marisa): basically different forms of "you" in varying levels of politeness
Aldus (Jess): ooo ok cuz i kinda notice the "ssi" part only becuase my name is jessi in the game so at first i was like "is this game just that smart?"
Nokri (Marisa): *yes*
Aldus (Jess): but yea that part interests me cuz i think it gives insite into how the characters see each other that we miss out on
Nokri (Marisa): yeah 😭 there's no equivalent in english. come on english.
Aldus (Jess): yea right!
Aldus (Jess): oh no i was supposed to pack but here i am talking about korean honorifics
Nokri (Marisa): we're getting enlightened it a good use of time
Aldus (Jess): *why they keep calling him mr. saeran when they know his last name*
Nokri (Marisa): p o l i t e
Aldus (Jess): so awkward lmao
Aldus (Jess): everyone keeps complimenting him hes probably so confused
Nokri (Marisa): i like how he's so quiet and reserved with everyone and doesn't talk, then with MC it's like "hey come check out this flower. what are you doin."
Aldus (Jess): "ok ok so mc, lemme tell you about flower language ok?"
Aldus (Jess): too pure
Aldus (Jess): why do seven and saeran both know where this random ass cabin is?
Nokri (Marisa): hacker secret
Nokri (Marisa): better question is *whos cabin is that*
Aldus (Jess): right!?
Aldus (Jess): guy goes on a fishing trip, cant wait to get to his cabin, opens the door and sees either v,searans, or sevens route events going on WTF
Aldus (Jess): "why is there a man bleeding all over my cabin?"
Nokri (Marisa): sees seven and vanderwood "what's up with these druggies"
Aldus (Jess): at least no ones bleeding this time!
Aldus (Jess): Wait... How is there food in an abandoned cabin in the woods 🤔
Elfriede (Tom): Ask the elder scrolls that too
Elfriede (Tom): Actually ask todd coward
Elfriede (Tom): He definitely knows
Aldus (Jess): TRUE
Nokri (Marisa): woo

Nokri (Marisa): GOOD STUFF
Nokri (Marisa): jess it's party day are you excited
Nokri (Marisa): i want to stay up because i know you're gonna flip but i can't stay up that late so maybe record your flipping on video or use tom
Aldus (Jess): Ahhh yea don't stay up. I usually wait till I get home to do the parties
Nokri (Marisa): didja do all the emails
Aldus (Jess): Ray got his face in her boob <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Ye I got like 20 I think
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Now k thanks
Aldus (Jess): So wholesome
Nokri (Marisa): so good
Nokri (Marisa): male MC. gasp.
Aldus (Jess): His call last night was so cute "know one ever cooked anything for me" 😭
Nokri (Marisa): WE'LL COOK TOGETHER
Aldus (Jess): Amazing. Idk where food came from but 👌
Nokri (Marisa): it's just. there. in the abandoned cabin.
Nokri (Marisa): a fully stocked kitchen.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Oh and "I wanna get you gifts but right now they can only be flowers" 😭
Nokri (Marisa): *flower crown flower crown*
Nokri (Marisa): goals
Nokri (Marisa): big MM group when
Aldus (Jess): The real dream 👌
Bill: *Note how there is no V*
Nokri (Marisa): his connection is breaking up
Bill: ~~So it's canon~~
Nokri (Marisa): V is taking the pic duh
Aldus (Jess): There's now saeran either
Nokri (Marisa): shHHh he's crying
Aldus (Jess): 
Aldus (Jess): That took forever to find
Nokri (Marisa): if we do a big group i could do ray/jaehee/mc/rika i am very flexible we just need people
Aldus (Jess): I can do mc/seven/saeran/v
Nokri (Marisa): @biru
Aldus (Jess): Could prob do yoosung with a little notice
Nokri (Marisa): we could do genderbent mysmes. one lucky guy to be male MC and lots of gorls
Nokri (Marisa): easier than finding crossplayers
Nokri (Marisa): maybe
Bill: Everyone in the MM fandom is crossdressing.
Aldus (Jess): Not for MM probably. It's like all girls
Bill: Why'd you @ me, you should @ jess.
Nokri (Marisa): 95% MC cosplays
Nokri (Marisa): ~~is this why there are no photoshoots~~
Aldus (Jess): I see lots of girls cosplay the boys
Nokri (Marisa): it's like our yona shoots that have 50 yonas and maybe 2 haks and 1 of each other character if we're lucky <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): tru yeah girls cosplay the guys
Nokri (Marisa): it's not very common though. or has it grown this year?
Aldus (Jess): I saw these peeps at next
Bill: So you can 50 girls cosplaying all the MM boys, one or two cosplaying MC/Rika(?), and one Tom.
Aldus (Jess): I've noticed quite a bit at least
Aldus (Jess): Tom? Like in-game Tom? No one cosplays him 😂
Nokri (Marisa): what about driver kim
Aldus (Jess): You'd see a vanderrwood cosplayer first
Nokri (Marisa): otakon photoshoot:
Aldus (Jess): Vanderwood cosplay when
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Bill: I don't know why no one does shoots though.
Aldus (Jess): Nicuuuuu
Bill: We *can* fix that.
Bill: I'd be game to help with that, but at least one of you has to help build the call list.
Nokri (Marisa): there's been a few but again it's like 90% MC
Nokri (Marisa): makes paired shoots a little impossible
Bill: I dunno which combinations of characters are worth doing.
Nokri (Marisa): jumin/zen lol
Aldus (Jess): Oops I'm doing mc Saturday
Bill: Yeah, I never see MC's.
Nokri (Marisa): be who you wanna be barbie
Bill: Lots of Seven, lots of Ray.
Aldus (Jess): I might do mc with sevens "too big" clothes on at some point cuz I think it cute

Nokri (Marisa): Seven and zen arm wrestling

Aldus (Jess): lol what
Nokri (Marisa): oops
Nokri (Marisa): did i list zen/jumin twice
Nokri (Marisa): eyyy
Nokri (Marisa): well zen/jumin and jumin/zen is technically a different pairing
Nokri (Marisa): if you want to get into semantics
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): i'm horrified i called someone on instagram
i know them we're friends
but what if they were super busy or in public or something
i tried to cancel it *but instagram wouldn't let me*
Bill: That's all the likely to be cosplayed ain't it?
Nokri (Marisa): she was cool with it but time to delete instagram in shame
Nokri (Marisa): maybe vanderwood
Bill: Ray having his own is a good, but does Saeran need to be separate from Unknown?
Nokri (Marisa): i've seen different variations of MC like redhead or blonde if you want to get super specific.
OH people might also surprise you and be glam choi/sarah/echo girl
Nokri (Marisa): yeah saeran and unknown are v different <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Elfriede (Tom): IM SO SORRY
Aldus (Jess): ugu i forgot mc wears thigh high socks and i dont have any in black
Bill: Alright if that's all the duo shots, all it needs is the groups. (IE, Team shots from RWBY)
Bill: Mint Eye. RFA.
Nokri (Marisa): hackers (seven/vanderwood/saeran)
rich kids (jumin/V/rika)
C&R (jumin/jaehee/mmmmaybe yoosung)
Nokri (Marisa): oh that too
Nokri (Marisa): casual story / deep story / another story
Bill: who'd be in Mint eye/RFA.
Nokri (Marisa): das easy
Nokri (Marisa): V would be in both right?
Bill: Namely mint eye, cause I can't figure out which Unknown version.
Aldus (Jess): YEA v is both
Nokri (Marisa): only ray/saeran would be mint eye
Nokri (Marisa): dark suit saeran not white shirt
Aldus (Jess): unknown is mint eye tho
Nokri (Marisa): tru dat
Nokri (Marisa): too many personalities that boy
Aldus (Jess): id say only white shirt searan or redhead saeran could be mint eye
Nokri (Marisa): saeran with red hair would yeah rfa
Nokri (Marisa): great minds
Aldus (Jess): theres essential 5 versions of searan ok
Bill: Saeran is RFA what.
Nokri (Marisa): in the after ending
Bill: Ya'll decide.
Bill: Idc.
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Nokri (Marisa): he's on the left here
Aldus (Jess): WHOLESOME
Bill: ~~Where's V~~
Nokri (Marisa): ***he's taking the photo***
Nokri (Marisa): wait
Nokri (Marisa): no he's dead there isn't he
Nokri (Marisa): v is dead.
Bill: I'd do After Ending as a different grouping, RFA should be the core 5 and MC I think.
Nokri (Marisa): and V he's the leader
Nokri (Marisa): *now who's forgetting V*
Aldus (Jess): yea v dead theere 😦
Bill: *That's why I used strikeouts*
Aldus (Jess): i wouldn't really both with aftereneding unless you see a redhead searan
Elfriede (Tom): WHOLESOME SADRAN
Aldus (Jess): SADRAN
Bill: should V be in the RFA call?
Nokri (Marisa): canon
Nokri (Marisa): ye
Nokri (Marisa): while MC is there V is the official leader of RFA
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Aldus (Jess): and then he go
Bill: 
Bill: Still not sure what mint eye should be.
Nokri (Marisa): wow look at u with ur programming type
Bill: *Well I'm a programmer so*
Nokri (Marisa): mint eye should be saeran/ray/rika
v can be standing slightly in the background
Nokri (Marisa): like this
Bill: Is there like, a Harem Rika grouping?
Nokri (Marisa): yoosung/v/jumin as rika's suitors and ray as her henchman
Nokri (Marisa): ~~that'd be a weird shoot~~
Aldus (Jess): all versions of saeran together
Bill: `* Split Personality (Ray/Saeran/Unknown)`
Aldus (Jess): only ray and darksuit searan are the split id say though? idk its really hard to differentiate with all his personas
Nokri (Marisa): white shirt saeran is dark suit + ray together
white shirt might be same as redhead?
Bill: It's just a 'ship name'. Doing non RWBY call lists really makes you miss how *everything* has a ship name in RWBY.
Aldus (Jess): id say they are simular but white shit seems alot happier than red head ~~cus he got da girl~~
Nokri (Marisa): everything has a ship name in homestuck but there a lotta characters in that
Nokri (Marisa): i looked up homestuck ship names wow this is so familiar
adorabloodthirsty haha
Aldus (Jess): this route is cray
Bill: So there no other combos worth doing?
Nokri (Marisa): just u wait owo
Bill: Any good meme stuff?
Aldus (Jess): how long would party take?
Aldus (Jess): probaly longer than 30 mins
Nokri (Marisa): yoosung and seven as gaming buddies
yoosung and zen as "ugh you're not my mom"
Nokri (Marisa): hmmm. it pretty long but not as long as the intro.
Nokri (Marisa): 30 minutes probably is enough
Nokri (Marisa): pls leave your reactions here i want to see them when i wake up, if i'm not awake when you do it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): eh dont wanna rush it, ill wait till i get home
Nokri (Marisa): yeah you'll need time to digest it
Aldus (Jess): im doing the preperation chat now
Nokri (Marisa): do you have any predictions
Aldus (Jess): i know a tiny bit that im not supposed to
Nokri (Marisa): *what do you know who told this to you*
Nokri (Marisa): ~~was it me oh no~~
Aldus (Jess): where 👏  is 👏  bae-ran 👏  (in this chat)
Aldus (Jess): no it was tumblr
Aldus (Jess): "don't trust my company"
Nokri (Marisa): great to say to someone who wants to work there
Aldus (Jess): jumin has offered yoosung and saeran jobs in the past 12 hrs
Nokri (Marisa): ~~*too bad seven's missing way to go jumin*~~
Aldus (Jess): more like way to go zen
Aldus (Jess): zen plz this is no time to talk about organic bananas
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): at least they're not imported and preserved for months
Aldus (Jess): jumin: ill buy you a whole truckload of bananas if it helps you save seven
Aldus (Jess): jumin stop offering everyone a job
Nokri (Marisa): it's what he does when he's scared
Aldus (Jess): ~~its adorable~~
Aldus (Jess): "hey everyone should come work here and that way youll all be safe"
Bill: >.>
Bill: Definitely Jumin.
Nokri (Marisa): jess what spoilers did you know i'm curious what tumblr is spewing
Aldus (Jess): i know seven is missing after the route
Bill: ~~Because Ray replaces him~~
Aldus (Jess): Nooooo!
Nokri (Marisa): only one hacker allowed
Aldus (Jess): Wow it's almost like we was watching the whole time <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Ray definitely kills him.
Nokri (Marisa): ray is dead it's saeran now
Aldus (Jess): NO hes trying to save him!
Aldus (Jess): tru
Nokri (Marisa): saeran just watching the entire chat over MC's shoulder breathing heavily
Aldus (Jess): allthough he did say mc could call him ray if she liked it more
Aldus (Jess): but i wouldnt do that cuz i likes his name, and is his real name
Aldus (Jess): i think the game just makes you call him searan anyway so no use fighting it
Nokri (Marisa): ye i wonder what happens if you call him ray
Nokri (Marisa): if it changes anything. probably not.
Aldus (Jess): yea idk prob not but like it doesnt feel right to me.
Aldus (Jess): omg his little speach bubble with the flowers on it is so cute
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH the jacob's ladder one?? it's like the only time he uses it ahh
Aldus (Jess): The Lily of the valley one
Nokri (Marisa): animal crossing has lied to me
Aldus (Jess): My mom really like Lily of the vally so it's like one of the only flowers I know
Aldus (Jess): It's actually poisonous tho don't eat it
Nokri (Marisa): they call this jacob's ladder in animal crossing but it's gotta be lily of the valley just look at it
Aldus (Jess): yea it def is
Aldus (Jess): HIS PIC CHANGE TO SMILE! bless
Aldus (Jess): opps didnt see boss coming over to my desk to engrossed in MM
Aldus (Jess): "sorry gotta read this extra long text from my boyfriend"
