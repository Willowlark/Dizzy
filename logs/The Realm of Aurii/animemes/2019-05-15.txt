Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Samantha "Sam" Manson (voiced by Grey DeLisle) is Danny's female best friend and eventually girlfriend at the end of the series"*
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's some good shit
Aldus Larian (Jess): üëå üëå üëå

Bill: Uraraka looks like she's 60 and Deku is late 30s?
Bill: It's weird.
Bill: And who is Bakugo paired with?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Kirimina is the first ship i saw either of them as actually
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk i couldnt figure that out
Aldus Larian (Jess): and yea all the boys are HUGE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ye
Bill: I'm sorry I just don't see why Kirishima and Bakugo being friends makes them extremely gay.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): No ship.has traction yo, fans do what they want lmao
Bill: But of course, all ships have no grounds yeah.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They at least are close
Bill: Including Bakugo and Uraraka, which I do like, so I don't judge for shipping Kiribaku just.
Bill: Remember that it's as noncanon as *everything else*.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Kiri is like his only friend though
Bill: Because Bakugo... doesn't want friends?
Aldus Larian (Jess): *except kiri*
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats the basis
Bill: By the end of college the only friend I had there was Andrew. Guess we're gay now.
Bill: Besides, friendship and romantic interest are two different axises for most people.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah like, the Kiribaku ship is cute and all, but like, you can be really good friends and not be gay...
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea def. im just saying there IS a base. its not like shipping two character that dont even know each other
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@301927856240459777> this was that fine I got on sale <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
