秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): tohru what is wrong with your skirt
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🤔
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm really glad they're remaking the anime because they changed a lot for the first anime. it's kind of like FMA and FMA: Brotherhood.
my only gripe about the manga is that everybody winds up with someone. everybody finds love which is kind of the point to breaking the curse but wow that's a lot of characters to ship
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): at least everyone major gets a spot to shine on the manga
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): wow. the different between tohru on volume 1 and volume 20
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): pretty sure that's tohru?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): hair seems different though i could be wrong rip
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): shigure on 4 and 18
Bill: Yeah right, how dare everyone get shipped.
Bill: I don't get it though, I thought it was a reverse harem.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): nnnnnnnnnot quite? I guess people ship Tohru/Kyo and Tohru/Yuki, and she lives in a house of guys but no one ships her with Shigure because he's the joke character
Bill: Isn't there like 12 guys?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): she lives with the 3 guys and she helps more
noooo, the zodiac cast are all split up. half are guys but there are also girls
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the tiger, the boar, the horse. hm. maybe only those three. but tohru's female friends also have big roles in the series and most of the guys already have romantic interests.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the anime also turned one character into a guy who was supposed to be a girl
Bill: well that's an oddity.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ya
who everybody ends up with romantically isn't who you think it will be which is neat
Bill: that's nice though.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): some do but some are obviously unhealthy relationships that get worked through and go their separate ways
Bill: Obvious arcs are boring.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): everybody watched fruits basket dubbed that was a lot of people's first exposure to anime
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): so much nudity
Bill: hawt.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i hope it doesn't flop like sailor moon crystal
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): but the trailer looks great
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i heard there was an ad for it over times square
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): wow i can't believe saeran stole hatsuharu's outfit
Bill: oof old art.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): oh yeah. we're goin' back to the 90s.
Bill: I was thinking of reading it but older art isn't my thing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): damn he got and arm tattoo and everything
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah the beginning is especially rough, and the anime looks obviously dated now too. might be best to wait for the new anime. there's a new manga in serialization right now but it's a sequel.
Bill: ye I'll wait.
Bill: I gotta figure out where I was in tomo chan.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): tomooooo
