Aldus Larian (Jess): Looks familar tho
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo yeah they look really familiar. Is there any text on the back? Is it a sticker? I know like 12 anime guys it could potentially be if thatâ€™s an official collaboration item. If itâ€™s fanart that be a little harder
Nokri (Marisa): Like the last Haikyuu keychain someone posted here looked nothing like the guy aaaa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): looks like he's got a cup of tea
Nokri (Marisa): It looks fan made?
Nokri (Marisa): I just checked the animate shop, itâ€™s not from any currently running campaigns but doesnâ€™t this dude from enstars look like Emma
Nokri (Marisa): If I had to make a guess then heâ€™s from either eccentric family or fate cafe collars but honestly he could be from a billion different things
Nokri (Marisa): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Could it be Goro Akechi?
Nokri (Marisa): it could but goro has redder eyes
Nokri (Marisa): o wait it might be him
Nokri (Marisa): no nvm its not
Nokri (Marisa): the official goro cafe stuff give him an ahoge and his eyes are redder
Nokri (Marisa): the lines on him don't look very professional, i don't think that's official art <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): could be wrong tho
