Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's good. Everyone got the mysterious Mint Eye email and Seven tracked it so shit's about to go down. Jaehee sent Jumin on a business trip to the Middle East. Jumin called Yoosung's mom who's now pissed and heading over to scold Yoosung. It's wild
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's nice that no once seems to be opposed to MC's choice of boyfriend for once lol. In Zen's route Jaehee was like STOP RUINING HIS CAREER and in Jumin's Zen was like STAY AWAY FROM THAT DUDE but in Seven's, everyone's like WOW YOU TWO REALLY GET EACH OTHER
