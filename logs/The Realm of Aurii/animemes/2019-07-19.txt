Nokri (Marisa): KyoAni said that they have a security system where you need to scan a badge to enter the building, but they had turned it off for the day because they were expecting many out-of-studio visitors for a meeting
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah I read that too! Either a huge coincidence, or the guy knew they were expecting guests...
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :(
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn that's insane
Nokri (Marisa): When Yun's voice rings out, "It's morning,"
Hak and I have our morning training,
Kija and Shin-ah's fishing,
Jaeha lends a hand cooking,
waking up to Zeno making Yun angry,
sharing just a bit of breakfast in front of the campfire.
That's how our modest yet happy days begun.
Nokri (Marisa): Those days will soon bring about the end.
Nokri (Marisa): nnoooOOOOO
