N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): that was a funny shirt
sometimes hot topic steals its designs from deviantart, there was a whole thing about that where deviantart was selling its users art because they could legally do that
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nuuuuu! Mine has cheritz copyright on it so I think it's officially licensed?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Betta be
N🆗ri (Marisa): that good!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't find pictures of the aniplex booth from this year. is neverland even animated by aniplex?

N🆗ri (Marisa): they've got the mom from that vrmmo mom fetish series on the left there lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg a person a follow on Tumblr just posted "where the fuck did this quote on the MM hot topic shirt come from"
Aldus Larian (Jess): THE WHAT NOW
N🆗ri (Marisa): THEY READ UR MIND
Aldus Larian (Jess): At least I'm not the only one who's confused
N🆗ri (Marisa): "Do you like your mom? Her normal attack is two attacks at full power" is the name of it
when it first came out they were giving away free samples if you bought stuff at animate with your mom
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh this shirt? omg yeah what's with that quote
https://www.hottopic.com/product/mystic-messenger-707-unknown-girls-ringer-t-shirt/11777838.html?cgid=pop-culture-shop-by-license-mystic-messenger#start=1
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's a really weird quote
Aldus Larian (Jess): What does that even MEAN
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like ???
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's for like. edgy girls with highly religious parents who wants weeb merch but her parents think it's sacerligious filth.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can kind of see it making sense for seven and saeran but. doesn't work on that shirt.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg they didn't have the formal attire this year but they did have lifesize demons
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA that's what the person I follow said kinda they were like "it almost works but doesn't and they're are definitely better quotes"
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG NOPE NOPE NOPE
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's terrifying
N🆗ri (Marisa): it doesn't show the bottom i wonder if there's a dead conny inside
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then they said "sounds like some cliche hot topic slogan"
Aldus Larian (Jess): nOoooOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ommg yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): When you where your fandom so subtly even other fans would have a hard time figuring it out:

N🆗ri (Marisa): so you start telling everyone
"wow nice shirt"
"thanks it's inspired by a 2d boy i fell in love with who's part of a cult but everything's ok now i'm just waiting to see if his brother is dead or not in the next update."
Aldus Larian (Jess): WhOOOooo

N🆗ri (Marisa): yoi really died down fast
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll never forget when the party scene aired at the end of that one episode and the fandom collectively lost all of its brain cells for a solid eternity
Aldus Larian (Jess): i never watched yoi
N🆗ri (Marisa): you should. it's good. also the party scene is one of the greatest and most unexpected scenes of all time.
N🆗ri (Marisa): everyone who watches the show suddenly becomes an expert in pro figure skating
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was big with professional skaters too, the guy Viktor is based off of did his routine from the anime and people would gift the skaters dolls from the show and whatnot. they followed it during the simulcast
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Fuccccckkkkk youuuu umbrella academyyyyy

Aldus Larian (Jess): OH vanya is literally a white violin in the comic LOL
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hahahaha
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The clapping is her being dummy thicc
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO TOM NO XD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I liked the characters alot from umbrella factory
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The plot wasnt bad
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE characters were good
Bill: Character's made the show.
Bill: Sword art has not only had 3 episodes of the villain ranting exposition, but she’s done it naked.
Bill: Just straight up naked.
Bill: Why?
Bill: No idea.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oof
Bill: It’s even more cringe than exposition as is.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why are u still watching it? 😂
Bill: I dunno man.
Bill: Habit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😂
Bill: This isn’t dramatic cause a flying naked woman is throwing energy beams at a Loli in a video game.
Bill: And it’s like a line of heroic sacrifices.
Bill: > spend episode building up final boss minion
> talk all sorts of threats about how it’s really strong
> use a random self sacrifice and one shot it
> use a random self sacrifice and one shot it
Bill: Okay I’m up to date on SAO and giving up on edgy magical girls that kill people cause it’s not worth the number of episodes I’m behind.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Promised Neverland man
Bill: All that’s left is Maranara Friends, the show about Afina in magic school and her dragon lesbian friend. They’re short episodes and pretty so well see how long till I give up.
Bill: I refuse to call it anything but maranara sauce and dragon lesbian show.
Bill: Not Afina even got a stalker knight boi.
Bill: 
Bill: Actual props though, they introduced her protector bodyguard guy as a joke, but in the second episode he’s actually following her in a dangerous location, he’s not just a token male for the show.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg the bodyguard is a huge joke he’s like where’s Waldo, they hide him in every episode
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s so good
Bill: Dragon chick just had to fucking she’d and everyone freaks out. Nice.
Bill: Shed
Bill: Lives up to the summary. Soon as dragon wake up she high key lesbean.
Bill: Oh that’s adorable she self conscious about her tail size.
Bill: Afina on a Sneaky roll
Bill: Afina: everyone’s cramming for finals and I’m so smart I don’t need to and now I’m lonely

Mood actually.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are you bragging? 👀
Bill: There is literally one student here, and I’m not her so... no?
Bill: Grad school wasn’t like that for me, but undergrad was.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You said mood so I thought you were
Bill: I mean, it is a mood. I was always bored during finals season cause I wanted to have fun and everyone was cram jamming.
Aldus Larian (Jess): You get away with it ✨ this time ✨
Bill: 😏 *Watcha going to do, report me to the server admin*
Aldus Larian (Jess): No I'll just call you an asshole
Bill: *You can’t do it faster than I can*
Bill: She *literally* said she was lonely after the tests.
Bill: What the fuck it went from lonely schoolgirl to the school being invaded.
Bill: Anime elfriede is a thug damn.
Bill: It was a drill and they had to ban Afina from being in it cause she’s busted lol
Bill: Why am I still watching this.
Bill: Dragon lesbean: what book is that
Afina: how to snag a date with him, love potion included
Me: *you aren’t a-*
Afina: wonder if it would work on a girl
Me: *all checks out*
Bill: Okay this is boring and even live snarking doesn’t help anymore.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dragon lesbian must be added to Aurii yes
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
