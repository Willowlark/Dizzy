Aldus (Jess): Apparently they talked about the ssum at 330 today? I missed that though , I did show up just as they we're closing up the booth and got a pic of the chertiz team with some cosplayers and stuff
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): oh ye! i saw a post somewhere that said they were announcing the voice actor for the ssum at closing ceremonies.

Nokri (Marisa): did you catch them right as the dealers hall was closing?
Aldus (Jess): It was like an hour before closing

Nokri (Marisa): irl heart collecting, the next DLC

Aldus (Jess): I realised after checking my tumblr I'm pretty sure I talked to a girl in line the other day that I follow üòÆ
Aldus (Jess): She got the body pillow I jelly
Nokri (Marisa): omg 2 years ago I went to a small idol event here with a friend who was scheduled to sing on stage, because she was really nervous going alone, and there were like 5 people there total in the crowd and one of them was a boston cosplayer that I followed on tumblr it was insane
Nokri (Marisa): in jaapn
Nokri (Marisa): twitter is the big thing here so we followed each other on twitter and she had the same username as the tumblr account so i was like "wait a minute."
Aldus (Jess): OMG that's crazy. I almost wanna be like " I think I talked to you" but that feels creepy <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): heavy breathing and "i like ur tumblr posts"
def not weird
Aldus (Jess): Lmaoooo  yea not at all
Aldus (Jess): Also I bought so much friggin mm stuff in the artists alley üò¨
Nokri (Marisa): money well spent
Aldus (Jess): I got a poster with all of them on it it even has vanderwood it was the last one I had to have it

Nokri (Marisa): Play that country road
Aldus (Jess): Yea we stopped for food and stuff
Aldus (Jess): ~~so excited to do triple saeran at katsu with you~~ üò≠
Nokri (Marisa): Is everyone in cosplay? What was it like when you stopped for food I find that the weirdest con stories come from those breaks
Aldus (Jess): Nah we didn't cosplay today cuz we wanted to be in optimal shopping mode
Nokri (Marisa): cosplay an angry middle aged suburban mom
ultimate shopping cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): this but MM
Aldus (Jess): Omg yes I need to do this I wanna do the "who says fuck" one
Nokri (Marisa): never stab: ray, V
stab in retaliation: zen, jaehee, jumin, saeran (good end ver.)
yells: yoosung
without warning: unknown, rika
stab as warning: vanderwood, seven
?
jumin is a tricky one he'd probably pay someone to stab for him idk
Nokri (Marisa): seven might also yell
Aldus (Jess): They protec, they attac
Aldus (Jess): https://peachyyvbee.tumblr.com/post/174878968212/dont-pull-the-trigger-spare-poor-bby-vs-life
Nokri (Marisa): that's canon
Nokri (Marisa): from that one text message V is able to send on the day it's saeran and rika only chats
that's exactly what happened next
Aldus (Jess): Sae-bby plz
Aldus (Jess): I can't wait for more art to come from the Otakon stuff
Nokri (Marisa): the mystic mess art renaissance resurgence is upon us
Aldus (Jess): PLZ I live on art
Aldus (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  here's my trash haul üëå
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs beautiful
I like how rika is in the back of the poster like ‚Äúhey guys I‚Äôm here too‚Äù
Nokri (Marisa): Big seven
Nokri (Marisa): Wow a tom pillow nice
Nokri (Marisa): Do you use stickers or do you keep them on the original sheet for eternity
Aldus (Jess): I've started outing them on magnet sheets and using them on my fridge! Cuz before I could never decide what to out them on
Nokri (Marisa): GOOD IDEA
Aldus (Jess): Ray charm is unknown on other side I have a seven one from the same artist
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs so charming
Aldus (Jess): I got the rfa pin for free cuz we all bought so much nicer stuff from the same booth
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs a nice cute
Aldus (Jess): Zen phone charm was half off so I basically had too
Nokri (Marisa): No choice it was inevitable
Nokri (Marisa): Fweebies uwu
Aldus (Jess): Right?! I got an Adam and Eve (nier) keychain too and I realise people would probably think they are from the same thing opps
Nokri (Marisa): So zen isn‚Äôt human then. That‚Äôs why his looks are so perfect. He‚Äôs literally inhuman.
Aldus (Jess): He's an Android it makes total sense now
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo you gots a noragami poster too!
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Nokri (Marisa): Was there a lot of noragami?
Nokri (Marisa): Last year there was a really good noragami panel that contrasted the show with actual Shinto religion it was really interesting
Aldus (Jess): Omg that sounds amazing
Aldus (Jess): *slaps keychain ring*
"This bad boi can fit so many sets of emotionly compromised twins on it "
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): It is strong
It carries their burdens
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> I didn‚Äôt screen cap it, but Erik is downloading mystic messenger and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust tlt_wm, he is an enabler‚Äù.
Nokri (Marisa): Is that a call out post
Bill: He just sent it directly, but it was formatted like a story post.
Bill: Maybe he decided to wait till he played it some.
Bill: Is there any crash course he should read starting out?
Bill: Now be the time to send him it.
Nokri (Marisa): Depends on whose route he‚Äôs doing
But part of the fun is also potentially getting a tragically bad end owo
Nokri (Marisa): Due to in game restraints he‚Äôll be forced to do either yoosung, zen, or Jaehee first
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): These books come with free magus bride playing cards
Does that mean I have to buy 52+ books to collect them all
Aldus (Jess): Yea he sent it to me too
Nokri (Marisa): congratulations you have become the mystic mess senpai
Nokri (Marisa): relatable
Nokri (Marisa): wait fudge
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): it's backwards but there it is.
Nokri (Marisa): meanwhile saeran's hands are just constant middle fingers
Aldus (Jess): "legally not allowed to say fuck"
Nokri (Marisa): saeran's handwriting is really messy because he has to wrap his middle finger around it to write because he never stops giving the middle finger
Aldus (Jess): Erik's addicted to mm already üòÇ
Nokri (Marisa): keep checking in
i introduced it to a girl i know and the next day she had finished like 2 of the routes by buying them
i was like 'wot'
Nokri (Marisa): i like the real time thing though i think it's cool
Aldus (Jess): Omg how much would that cost üòÆ
Nokri (Marisa): ```Original Story: 20 HG for day 1, 30 HG for day 2-4, and 50 HG for day 5-11```
a lot
20 + (30x3) + (50 x 7) = 460 hourglasses per route?
it's $9 for 300 hourglasses or $26 for 1000 so she probably paid at least $26 for two routes
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> I think I spend like 20? For enough to get the another story routes at that was it
Nokri (Marisa): cheritz thanks u
Aldus (Jess): I've spend 50 on games with less total playtime so I thought it was justified <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): otome games?
Aldus (Jess): Oh no lol mm is literally the only vn or otome I have played
Nokri (Marisa): [sends u hatoful boyfriend]
Aldus (Jess): Ah yes I love pigeons
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Oh man I don't think I can make those kinds of choices
Nokri (Marisa): a difficult decision indeed
Nokri (Marisa): i must have discord spidey sense because every time i check back someone starts typing
Aldus (Jess): So I noticed this also! It's def either a writers error or a translation error in the day 10 call on Ray's routes when he says he going out to find you primrose: http://asking-mystic-messenger.tumblr.com/post/170742918680/saeran-and-flowers
Nokri (Marisa): man flowers are weird
Nokri (Marisa): i had to explain to a kid what "man" meant when used as emphasis
and then he was like "ok so when do we say woman"
Aldus (Jess): oh no poor child
Nokri (Marisa): "we don't say that but good idea"
Aldus (Jess): yea! i didnt know lily of the valley could grow as a weed but it i found like 2 stalks in my back yard and i was like "wait wat"
Nokri (Marisa): *jess u can't grow weeds in your backyard that's illegal*
Aldus (Jess): good post op im glad im not crazy
Aldus (Jess): D:! but it so pretty, it not a real weed
Aldus (Jess): i have so much work to do but i just wanna sit on tumblr üò≠

Nokri (Marisa): oh no i have homework

"my body is weak and can't handle lies" after telling V he's a good photographer lol
Aldus (Jess): YEA omg that was savage
Aldus (Jess): did you see the whole skit? 2 of them do product ads during it too
Nokri (Marisa): idk if it was the whole thing, but yoosung advertised zen's body pillow and unknown advertised the believer package
Nokri (Marisa): hilarious
Aldus (Jess): YEA THAT WAS GOLD
Aldus (Jess): i was dying
Nokri (Marisa): someone on tumblr is calling zen modest haha ok friend
Aldus (Jess): "thats just a cosplayer"

Aldus (Jess): holy jawline V

Aldus (Jess): LOL thats sentence is more fitting than i intended
Nokri (Marisa): "another time, i'm losing cell connection"
Aldus (Jess): ~~fu v zens better at makeup anyway~~
Nokri (Marisa): zen probably has a makeup tutorial youtube channel
Aldus (Jess): he so does
Nokri (Marisa): and to make him mad Jumin pays for C&R advertisements to play at the beginning of each video
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): i love that meme
Nokri (Marisa): for anime it's so great
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): the "just monica" think was the first thing i though when he was the only one listed in the messenger
Aldus (Jess): i have to watch that!
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i LOVE princess tutu
comiket reignited my long lost love
it's almost as good as yona
Aldus (Jess): WAT omg
Nokri (Marisa): have you heard of it
Aldus (Jess): na just the  other day when u mention
Elfriede (Tom): Oof made in abyss memes are brtual
Nokri (Marisa): this is an old and a little tiny spoilery amv that sums up the series really well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9197GTl1ASg
Elfriede (Tom): There was some good made in abyss cosplays at ota
Nokri (Marisa): amazing amv
MADE IN ABYSS COS AT OTA WHAT
Elfriede (Tom): Someone did robot boi at least
Nokri (Marisa): PICS?
Nokri (Marisa): I GOTTA FIND IT
Nokri (Marisa): made in abyss is good.
Nokri (Marisa): up there with princess tutu and yona.
Nokri (Marisa): basically a ballerina magical girl anime told in the style of a fairy tale
about a duck who sees a lonely prince without a heart (it was shattered into pieces by the raven king) and wants to help him, so she wishes to become a human girl
the duck can turn into a girl, but if she quacks she turns back into a duck (i forget how she turns back into a girl. hm. something to do with her amulet.) she can also turn into the magical princess tutu to help the prince get his heart back piece by piece, but it's super painful for the prince because emotions suck.
Aldus (Jess): üòÆ
Aldus (Jess): why they ducks tho?
Nokri (Marisa): because it's really funny
Nokri (Marisa): just the main character is a duck
Nokri (Marisa): some other characters are humanoid animals because the town is cursed by the fairy tale
Nokri (Marisa): their teacher is a cat, one of their classmates is an anteater
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): but they act like normal humans. ahiru as a duck is just a regular duck who can't be understood. when the fairy tale is finished they turn back into normal humans
Elfriede (Tom): I saw a few yonas too
Nokri (Marisa): YOANAAAAA
there was one at comiket it was beautiful
Elfriede (Tom): But yeah! I was gonna take a picture for you but they seemed busy
Elfriede (Tom): Robo boi that is
Elfriede (Tom): Lots of artists had made in abyss stuff too
Elfriede (Tom): It's not talked about alot cuz it's not on Crunchyroll but the community that did watch it loves it so
Nokri (Marisa): yeah i was really surprised how popular it is here too, but the fandom is really quiet about it
i didn't think it was that big until literally every bookstore had huge piles of the new volume
Aldus (Jess): where did we start to watch it?
Elfriede (Tom): Some knockoff site
Aldus (Jess): nicu
Elfriede (Tom): No idea where to watch it legit
Nokri (Marisa): Import $90 dvds
Aldus (Jess): üò≠
Aldus (Jess): itll be like tokyo ghoul where i wanna watch it for years and never get too

Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Is Jumin and a trench coat a thing? There's a pair of images with him and MC in trenchcoats.
Aldus (Jess): Ye he wears one in his after end
Bill: gotcha.
Aldus (Jess): 
Bill: *Wholesome game*
Aldus (Jess): Kissing is not non-wholesome
Bill: 
Bill: http://e-shuushuu.net/images/2016-12-21-878918.jpeg They did all of them. First sign of V, which continues to support that everyone hates him, i'm like 5 pages in.
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): The one I posted is from a longer really silly comic thats pretty cute
Aldus (Jess): Kitty zenny!
Aldus (Jess): He allergic to himself
Bill: üå∂
Aldus (Jess): Kawacy!!

Bill: *You're supposed to grow out of the edgelord phase when you have a kid Ray*
Aldus (Jess): HELL NAW
Aldus (Jess): All of myeties stuff is wonder
Bill: Save that to shoot.
Aldus (Jess): Need a secen crying in the background
Bill: ~~Wholesome~~\
Elfriede (Tom): Why do they have ears tho
Aldus (Jess): it halloween!
Aldus (Jess): there in a haunted house thingy
Bill: it's finally a V image!
Bill: took to the 19th page.
Aldus (Jess): ugu now i wanna go look at all her stuff again
Bill: (everyone else gets a fair split of focus images tho, am impressed)
Aldus (Jess): http://www.myetie.me/mmlist
Bill: *and it was the last page*
Bill: There was *one* V image.
Aldus (Jess): never used that image board so idk
Bill: It's wholesome, which is why I use it cause I dunt have to worry about someone seeing lewds. But, a girl has to be in every image.
Aldus (Jess): 18 pages doesnt sound like mearly enough mm content XD
Bill: Also there's no Rika, period. I dunno if that's normal, but maybe Rika/V are too spoilery for the people who use it.
Bill: It's *alot* more than I expected. Given girls rule.
Aldus (Jess): but like half the mm ark in the world has mc so
Bill: which strikes me as odd... Like, it makes perfect sense, but in the *typical* all male and one female case show, the girl gets no fan art.
Aldus (Jess): https://78.media.tumblr.com/f516377df989275a22dc09c89f8a8462/tumblr_ofiay5ODmh1ulxhhlo1_r1_1280.png

Aldus (Jess): ive found the most on tumblr personally image board seem to be pretty male oriented in my experience
Bill: If you mean the content caters to guys, absolutely true. Tumblr is the fangirl's world.
Aldus (Jess): Yea it's like only choice for girl I feel like üò≠
Bill: Pinterest has a strong female base too.
Bill: Marisa may know more boards that are less about cute girls.
Bill: I've never found a board that had good quality and selection for male characters. Sucked when I wanted Ren reference images back when.
Aldus (Jess): Yea I just personaly don't lie Pinterest cuz it's extremely un organized and everything is reposted
Bill: Meanwhile I can't navigate tumblr worth a damn.
Aldus (Jess): Like ppl will post one page of a comic and you'll never see the rest
Aldus (Jess): At least o Tumblr you can go to OPs blog and find more
Bill: But you have to find content in the first place.
Aldus (Jess): I mean Tumblr search system sucks cuz ita only one rag at a time and like no filters
Bill: What kind of tag is #saeranisthetopicofmydreamseverynight
Aldus (Jess): Lmao that's Tumblr for you
Aldus (Jess): If OP tagged something correctly it show up in a search for it
Aldus (Jess): Kinda like insta
Bill: 
Bill: ~~It's almost the same color as my Sapphire Reserve~~
Bill: Ray wins the movie set.

Bill: mm. I mean, all of it is amusing.
Aldus (Jess): i know it all so good
Bill: Zen's kinda boring and Yoosung is only cute when he's with MC, but the rest is funny.
Bill: *shit I need a bandaid, all this edge gave me a cut*
