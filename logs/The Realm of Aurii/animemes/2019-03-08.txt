Elfriede Faun (Tom): Moar bee from that artist
Bill: https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2019/03/07/girls-in-tights-themed-anime-miru-tights-starts-streaming-on-may-11 ~~it's... about girls wearing tights?~~
Bill: *TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): love me those girls with covered legs
Bill: That cause it's lent?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): sorry but this sentence did it for me: The three girls: Len Aikawa (CV: Haruka Tomatsu), Yua Nakabeni (Yoko Hikasa), and Homi Moegi (Aya Suzaki) gather in a classroom at dusk. You can also see the diffrences of each tight that they wear.
Bill: To it's credit, it's a web anime which means it *literally* exists to be pretty and that's it.
Bill: Hell, it based of an illustration series with no content.
Aldus Larian (Jess): how does that give it credit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~all the tights look the same~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ☝
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea maybe varying levels of sheerness but thats it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the color tones are slightly different
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): *slightly*
Bill: What I mean is they know it's fetish material.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): in the banner photo on the Twitter page it's mor apparent
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooo ~~I assumed that was supposed to be obvious~~
Bill: With Japan?
Bill: They seem to think fetish shit is normal idk.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean, don't they have used panty vending machines?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): didnt marisa tell us about that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof
Bill: Pretty much.
Bill: So like, it'd be entirely possible for Japan to be like "Yeah, a 24 minute show about girls prancing around in tights? Families will eat this shit up! It'll be the next sesame street!"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬
Bill: This is probably 3 minutes, potentially 1 and a half if you count an opening, and rather pointless.
Aldus Larian (Jess): so its a foot fetish thing ya?
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: I just saw the anime news feed lol
Bill: Never seen it before.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well yea i didn't think so there just seems to be alot feet
Bill: Probably. Feet, pantsu under tights, that's pretty much what I see in the exhibition photos.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean... ~~I find tights sexy~~... why exactly? I have no fucking clue
Bill: 👍
Bill: No one can explain it. We all can understand it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): seems counterintuitive because typically wearing less clothing is more sexy but like... tights, amn
Bill: 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean to be fair, tights are pretty 👌  but.... an entire anime?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): anime was a mistake
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea agreed
Bill: It's a short anime.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it.... still is a mistake
Bill: So it's like... basically an ad for the artbooks.
Bill: oh anime is a huge mistake.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): all of it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah...
Bill: and we're all trash for enjoying it.
Bill: also isn't there a thing about what you can *almost* see is sexier than what you straight up can?
Bill: I remember jokes about ankles in the 1800s being that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats definitely true
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah true
Bill: ~~damn straight it is~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like why thigh highs are sexier than like, knee highs or shorter hosiery
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): clothing is weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shows off the "absolute territory" as meg says
Bill: *Meg?* That's standard anime trope.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE OK
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fjdhgfjhafl
Bill: *There are charts*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i was just like *excuse me?*
Bill: 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): this does not say absolute territory
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): invalid
Bill: ACtuAlLY it's https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZettaiRyouiki
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): there we go
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thank you
Bill: Pretty sure I was the one to tell Meg what it was.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): as **Bill* says
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): wtf discord
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how did that happen
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but im leaving it
Bill: ~~*GOD anime is a mistake*~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yep it sure was
Bill: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheissTitillationTheory
Bill: Tights counteract that tho.
Bill: this is a cosplayer mood.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "glue and a prayer"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats a fucking huge ass mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *MARGIN OF ERROR*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats literally what 6O is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wtf they have it down to a mathematical process
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): glue and a prayer
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i hate the world sometimes LMAO
Bill: What you mean is that you hate that Yoko Taro *likes women*.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no fam, i love that. made that game even better
Bill: True.
Bill: veeeery true.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But as a cosplayer...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): as a cosplayer with real life boobs, it's like  ....MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM <:BOI:549661126141411351>
Bill: 🙏
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:BOI:549661126141411351> 👏😑
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): although going back to the "possibility it might fall off" thing, tights are thin and delicate and prone to ripping which is like, the equivalent to it falling off
Elfriede Faun (Tom): This bish just wearing 2bs leotard bruhhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Theft
Aldus Larian (Jess): is magus bride getting a movie or second season?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): season 2
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is it?? Where source
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.facebook.com/873876676046704/videos/vb.873876676046704/258700175068528/?type=2&theater
Aldus Larian (Jess): dis all i seen so far
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s really weird I can’t find any info about it. There’s no way there’s enough manga material for a second season, the first season and the manga were caught up at the same time and the last episode ended the same time the same chapter was released
N🆗ri (Marisa): School arc would be cool but it *just* started
N🆗ri (Marisa): The official twitter did announce a stage play though
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: yeeee, I'd expect to see ann articles for a new season.
Aldus Larian (Jess): huh interseting
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe an OVA but the trailer is possibly fake since OVA info would spread like wildfire
Aldus Larian (Jess): if its fake its pretty impressive
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait found it
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think it’s a recruitment trailer for the magus bride fan club
Aldus Larian (Jess): nuuuuuu
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH BUT TOTSUKUNI NO SHOUJO IS GETTINA AN OVA sweet
N🆗ri (Marisa): couple goals
N🆗ri (Marisa): date goals
Aldus Larian (Jess): NICE
