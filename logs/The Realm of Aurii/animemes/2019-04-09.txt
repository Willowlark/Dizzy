Aldus Larian (Jess): That's Marisa!
Aldus Larian (Jess): "I'll just stay in the corner even though you love you love me and I totally don't have too"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do I play it cool, or go extra flirty ~~after a near death experience~~?
N🆗ri (Marisa): the corner is a highly coveted spot though so if someone else wants the corner i can move to another spot
N🆗ri (Marisa): follow ur heart
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i think he appreciates you being serious~~
Bill: That could have gone in a very different direction if Jumin didn’t join :lenny:

Bill: *why* he’s a creep in the series...

N🆗ri (Marisa): another emma cosplayer i met convinced me to finally start reading beastars and it is good but it also. hmm.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I've only ever experienced them in dub form
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye their japanese voices <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): inuyashaaaaaaaaaaaa
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Does that count as cannibalism
Elfriede Faun (Tom): People eat.placenra naf it's not so
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't think the herbivores eat eggs? they showed the school menu and only carnivores had eggs in their menus. this is like zootopia the manga
N🆗ri (Marisa): people eat WHAT
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is it as much cannibalism as chewing off a bit if your lip, or biting your nails
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEAH THEY EAT THE PPACENTA FROM THE CHOLD THEY BORTH
N🆗ri (Marisa): today has been a day of too many revelations
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH THEIR OWN KID?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ????????????????//
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***???????????????????***
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEAH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THEY DO IT LOOK IT UP
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that. is that better or worse than someone elses' kid
N🆗ri (Marisa): im gonna take your word on this
Elfriede Faun (Tom): most people think it's gross but a select few hippies
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But it's semi common
N🆗ri (Marisa): never have i ever just ended or i'd throw that bombshell in there
N🆗ri (Marisa): why they do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if they just. didn't eat it.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placentophagy
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lots of animals do it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AHH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WHOA
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THATS A WIKI ARTICLE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WHY THE IMAGE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Heres my shiny pinco to hide that image
N🆗ri (Marisa): I WALKED AWAY FOR A MINUTE AND MISSED WHATEVER YOU POSTED SO I APPRECIATE THE SHINY PINECO IT'S BEAUTIFUL
N🆗ri (Marisa): the new sfw sasuke
N🆗ri (Marisa): peace of mind pineco
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 👆 👆 👆 👆 👆 ☝ ☝ ☝
N🆗ri (Marisa): do you know about this because jess's sister in law did it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): N O
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok. ok that's good. ok.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I don't know anyone who has done it personally
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But there's a number of spiritual and biological reasons people practice it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's thought to increase your health and breast milk after childbirth
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Specifically
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Plus lots of animals do it so humans are like
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Eyy that goat do it so
N🆗ri (Marisa): non-human animals also don't wear clothes and eat their own vomit <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But most animals.prob do it cuz food is scarce
N🆗ri (Marisa): would a vegan do it
N🆗ri (Marisa): if it's mostly hippies
how messed up does this rabbit hole get
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The placenta contains small amounts of oxytocin which eases birth stress and causes the smooth muscles around the mammary cells to contract and eject milk.[citation needed] There have been no studies of whether placentophagy provides hormonal effects in humans.
N🆗ri (Marisa): does eating human placenta put holes in your brain like eating other human flesh does
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So anyways
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is that cannibalism
N🆗ri (Marisa): **[CITATION NEEDED]**
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
i guess?? it's partial cannibalism maybe?
though. breast milk isn't cannibalism. hm.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): HHMMMM
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think my sister said she can see what websites we look up on the phone so i guess she's gonna have to deal with me looking up if eating placenta counts as cannibalism
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is it only cannibalism if it's mussle tissue?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oops sowwy sis uwu
N🆗ri (Marisa): so legally it's not cannibalism
N🆗ri (Marisa): but
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.google.com/search?q=is+placenta+cannibalism&oq=is+placenta+canni&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0.2361j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

N🆗ri (Marisa): I TAGGED THE WRON PGERSON

Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): I WROTE 'TO' AND HIT ENTER TO TAG AND IT TAGGED MARKS DAUGHTER
Elfriede Faun (Tom): HAHAHAHA OF ALL PEOPLE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NAH SHE WONT SEE
N🆗ri (Marisa): it never happened. that never happened.

N🆗ri (Marisa): life is disgusting
N🆗ri (Marisa): humans and animals and our double standards smh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Smh <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WE DONT RUN AROUND NAKED LIKE ANIMALS BUT EATING THE PLACENTA IS FINE KAREN?
N🆗ri (Marisa): DID JESS'S MOM EAT PLACENTA
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ~~wait Karen isn't a hippie name~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Uhhhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): What's a good hippie name
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***jess's mom no***
N🆗ri (Marisa): peace
N🆗ri (Marisa): but maybe spelled uniquely
N🆗ri (Marisa): pis (pronounced peace)
N🆗ri (Marisa): placenta black market where they give the products hippie names
Elfriede Faun (Tom): PEESE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Esmerelda
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That sounds like a good hippie name
N🆗ri (Marisa): the middle ground between disney lover and hippie
Elfriede Faun (Tom): If your sister asks you why you looked up placenta cannibalism let me know <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): she may stage an intervention
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So my parents also had chickens annnddddd
Elfriede Faun (Tom): If those eggs break
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Them chickens eat them
N🆗ri (Marisa): HWAET
N🆗ri (Marisa): AWHT
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Sorry to break it to you this way
N🆗ri (Marisa): 8 WORD HORROR STORY
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Chickens are egg cannibals
N🆗ri (Marisa): HOW DO THEY GET THE SHELL OPEN
N🆗ri (Marisa): UJST
N🆗ri (Marisa): RAW????
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THE BIG PECK
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEAH RAW
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????***
Elfriede Faun (Tom): (chickens also will eat cooked chicken)
Elfriede Faun (Tom): (don't ask how I know that)
N🆗ri (Marisa): now do chickens get holes in their brains like people do??
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I don't think so
N🆗ri (Marisa): DID YOU FEED A CHICKEN ONE OF ITS OWN
Elfriede Faun (Tom): **I** didn't <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): fghjfkjhysgtrfa
N🆗ri (Marisa): you just. watched.
N🆗ri (Marisa): for science.
N🆗ri (Marisa): atuyiyserawetkuh
N🆗ri (Marisa): do chickens eat their own feathers too???
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Now you know, you don't have to go buy a chicken and try to feed it eggs and chicken to find out
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I don't think hair and feathers are technically edible
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh there was a girl who ate her own hair for years and it matted inside of her stomach and she became nearly unable to digest anything because of all the hair
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AHHHHH
N🆗ri (Marisa): now do ducks and quails and other birds do this too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Most likely yeah
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Squirrels will eat  meat too!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's not that they can't eat meat it's that herbavoires can't hunt
N🆗ri (Marisa): humans had to be this savage at some point. we had to be absolute monsters. we still are, **given the whole placenta thing**, but like. when did humans stop being so vile publicly.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Good question
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Probably ling before written language
Elfriede Faun (Tom): For some
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel like the placenta thing might have recently stopped, like last several hundred years. but we innately knew cannibalism is sort of a last resort i think, right? so maybe it was never thing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): True
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Beaides like rituals
N🆗ri (Marisa): *did we eat our dead children*
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): to the rituals not the dead children that's still up in the air
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh yeah <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Well I suppose I should sleep so I leave you with that lovely information
N🆗ri (Marisa): ancient egyptians would bury dead kids in the house near their bed in the hopes they'd be reborn
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Go tell the world that people still eat placentas
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok thank you for the information i don't know what i'll do with it except stare at the wall and ponder but it's. sure something
N🆗ri (Marisa): have a nice night make sure jess eats some real non-placenta food
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ALREADY DONE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YOU TOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): hey everyone reading this in the morning check out tom's shiny pineco
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I evolved him and the resulting forteress is poop colored
Bill: Is that so
Bill: Marshall?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wtf happened in this channel last night
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just got the Choi bois flashback 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): The one where they're reading the book?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭 someone save them plz
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"I wish mom would hate me too and let me go."*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭 I'm gonna go rewatch it
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is it voiced, I forget?
Aldus Larian (Jess): "I cried because there was a spider in the kitchen so mom didn't feed me cuz I was loud" 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no, not voiced
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok yeah I'm mixing it up with Ray's route then
Bill: Im only on day 3 though?
Aldus Larian (Jess): seven cant count
Bill: Damnit Seven, why do you give me options when both of them will give you hearts.
Bill: He *likes* being snarked at.
Bill: ~~I got to armonk 10 minutes ago but haven’t gone into the building yet cause MM~~
Bill: Also David has big 707 energy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > In chatroom
> Seven enters
> Oh, hello MC
> MC looks up from phone
> I'M LITERALLY ACROSS THE APARTMENT
Aldus Larian (Jess): "oh look your here too"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Jumin: You're both here when you're in the same house?
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): jumin in his route "you're so cute talking on your phone with me in my house"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zen: "OMG MC dont let seven try anything with you"
Meanwhile: Seven: "ill be in the corner"
Aldus Larian (Jess): MC: "I wish he would"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It was really tempting to choose that response lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Zen: <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): zen is oblivious to the fact that women also have sex drives XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it might be a cultural thing though. I could be wrong but I'm guessing in Korea it's might be kind of taboo to stay together when you're not married? Idk. I don't know much about their culture
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo maybe!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Jumin: How does the special security system work?
> Seven: Oh, it just... *gets rid of the intruder*
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO i look up articles about couples living together and the author of the first article i find's name is "Hyun" (Zen's name)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Jumin: Is it some sort of weapon?
> MC: What? No way!
> Seven: Actually..............
> Jumin and MC: <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): The entire RFA: <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven: We're more safe by being in danger
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jumin:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh the glass repairman is another Mr. Kim
Aldus Larian (Jess): looks like older and higher class people see marriage as a necessity before living together but alot of younger or more common people see it as ok? they're like still getting used to the idea pretty much
Aldus Larian (Jess): and having kids out of wedlock is still a nono
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): MC: How do you think your brother broke through the glass?
Seven: *you were there...????*
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like how the window guy is like "stop throwing things when you get mad!"
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes perfect
N🆗ri (Marisa): can't believe the furry manga has a better plot and more twists than 99% of other manga
Bill: So says our resident furry representative.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow biru you read this manga too?
N🆗ri (Marisa): should've known
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah it's getting an anime!! i forgot. dang i should've waited to watch the anime.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damn
N🆗ri (Marisa): it looks so different animated and haru's voice is good but i imagined it higher pitched
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh gosh it's 3d animated. hmmm
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2yOkPQWWgs
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't think the 3D models give it justice <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Me: Mariaa did you eat
Marisa: how was your lunch
N🆗ri (Marisa): meal fight
N🆗ri (Marisa): legosi looks too handsome in the anime. i think they made his 3d model more shounen-protagonist-y whereas in the manga he looks freaky and spaced out all the time.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the 3D models just don't convey the same emotions <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 👀 <:woah:543194447345876998>
N🆗ri (Marisa): such a shame. the manga has won all sorts of awards so it was due for an anime, and the characters are incredibly diverse so using 3d models makes sense cost and efficiency-wise, but it takes away so much that made the manga good <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: Are heartbreaks an issue for not jumin?
N🆗ri (Marisa): makes u a neener but otherwise not really
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://youtu.be/H54fXCKuIkw?t=264
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no those things terrify me XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Seven I'm sorry for leaving the apartment, I just wanted to get you some Honey Buddha chips*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YOU WERE GONE FOR 7 MINS! AHHH
Aldus Larian (Jess): "i only had time to make you 3 sandwiches! I mean, make myself 6 sandwiches and only eat 3"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"I should have put a GPS tracker on your clothes"* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seven, your Jumin is showing
Bill: Oops I keep heartbreaking Yoosung.
Bill: the text speed is so slowww
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cant increase?
Bill: it doesn't help much...
Bill: and you have to do it for every chat.
Bill: Also, Zen kinda a dick?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah he's kind of a dick in the deep story
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he just *really* doesn't like Jumin
Bill: Yeah, only day 1 is the same between deep/casual?
Bill: Cause like.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't recall him being as bad in the casual story
Bill: Dragging Jumin for being rich is like.
N🆗ri (Marisa): even day 1 is different
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah even in Seven's route he super anti-Jumin
Bill: I'm surprised he doesn't attack Seven for being rich too like.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because Jumin and Seven are different types of rich. Like, yeah they both have money, but Jumin was brought up in a very different way because of his father and the business. Everything is very corporate and unfeeling. Business is business. Seven came from basically nothing and had to fend for himself and went through hardships to get where he is. He's been through some shit and so has Zen so he can relate to Seven a bit more
Bill: Sure. Tho Zen doesn't know all of Seven's backstory.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): true
N🆗ri (Marisa): seven is rich but his funds aren't solid money. he gets paid in cars, potato chips and soft drinks, pretty much whatever he requests. he probably has some actual cash but no bank accounts or any way to trace it
N🆗ri (Marisa): meanwhile jumin swims in a pool of cash like scrooge mcduck
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but Seven's personality just lines up more as a "normal" person whereas Jumin just represses all emotion and forgets what it really means to be empathetic
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): emotions are a waste of his time
Bill: It's probably cause deep route versus casual, but like. Damn. I don't like him. He's nothing more than flirt and drags Jumin for something he didn't have control over.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which leads him to miss certain social cues and say things without thinking how others may react
Bill: But, I skipped causal, so that's that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah Zen was much more likable in his own route
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and possibly Yoosung's. I forget
N🆗ri (Marisa): zen and yoosung's drunk phone call is beautiful
Bill: Yoosung is wayyyy to easy to get heartbreaks for. But I'm. Not the best with immature people to begin with so lol. Jaehee needs a vacation, poor girl.
Bill: Seven's kinda annoyingly trolly. I dig it, but I need a little of the non troll to acclimate.
N🆗ri (Marisa): get on his route <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Laterz
Bill: Jumin good for now.
Bill: ngl I don't think I could ever do casual route... The mundane ~~Rika worshipping~~ conversations kinda drag.
Bill: It's why I never played all of little busters, doing 2 weeks of the common route for every route sounded like hell.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 3 x 11 = 33 days! that's 33 days of people to talk to!! 😄
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or just pay to skip the common route and go right into day 5 of someone's route
N🆗ri (Marisa): do you have to unlock it first?
Bill: There's only one thing you had to unlock...
Bill: I think it's V and Rika's after endings.
N🆗ri (Marisa): all after endings should need to be unlocked by playing the route first, especially the secret ones
N🆗ri (Marisa): top secwet uwu
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think you need to do Vs after ending to get Rika story? Cuz it's locked for me
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea zen is different in casual routes in jaehees he's amazingly supportibe of her, he's good in yoosings too. He resents junin way to much
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I played his route first so got to see how they ended up being as friends before I realised that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH SHIT RIGHT i FORGOT ABOUT THAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa it was so good!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then I was like "aw he really hates him 😭"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): LET 👏🏻 THEM 👏🏻 BE 👏🏻 FRIENDS 👏🏻
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg love that cg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wholesome
Aldus Larian (Jess): Zens also pure emotion while jumin is pure logic
Aldus Larian (Jess): And it's fiction so
Aldus Larian (Jess): They exaggerate oppsosites
N🆗ri (Marisa): fffffic.....tion..?
N🆗ri (Marisa): real
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok so hear me out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Zen and Jumin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): two halves of a whole
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): complementary
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): black and white
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yin and yang
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jumin has emotionless gray eyes whereas Zen's are red with passiono
N🆗ri (Marisa): Zekyll & White
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeeeee!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): according to Google translate, Zen means "all"/"whole" in Japanese (and yes I know the characters are Korean) and Han means "half"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's a stretch, but still...
N🆗ri (Marisa): illuminati confirmed
N🆗ri (Marisa): 全・半
Aldus Larian (Jess): Erik hacked the game
N🆗ri (Marisa): unknown has so many different personalities because he's the embodiment of players who hack and subsequently get stuck in the game, gone mad because they are unable to escape
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm on my coworkers computer and my profile image is the default one and its just the same icon as unknown. Bit I'm like "why does this look so familiar"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *we're all Unknown*
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Oh good cuz works been so shitty I'm about go insane and start screaming at people~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~at least I'll be in character!~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): What are they gossiping about
N🆗ri (Marisa): one bag of honey budda chips left on the shelf but the shelf is behind the cash register and they don't want to talk to the clerk
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): YALL READY FOR SOME CUTE SHIT
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): little demons
N🆗ri (Marisa): evil incarnate
N🆗ri (Marisa): look at the smug smirk on the right one she's nefarious
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nuuuu they're adorable!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~they probably already know how to crash the global economy with one finger press~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WOW DAS CUTE
Aldus Larian (Jess): RIGHT?!🎉
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thanks caption was like "daddy did you buy honey buhda chips?"

N🆗ri (Marisa): the dub isn't so bad!! i know dub is suffering but fruits basket has arguably the best dub ever.
