Bill: Dat raiju manga is kinda low budget toradora, but pretty relatable as a loser otaku.
Bill: Oops nah 10 chapters in it’s falling into trope hell.
Bill: Mm..l like half of it is good, but the tropes wrapper around them make it feel generic. But there’s legitimate friendship between the sexes, which anime can’t figure out usually.
Bill: Girl picks out a new outfit for the guys date with the girl he’s into and he’s lit: “this is the first time I’m good looking” and I’m like if only that worked.
Bill: Second my hero movie apparently.
Bill: Also a 3rd season of SNAFU which I’m all about.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): NEW MY HERO MOVIE
Bill: oh, more reasons that manga is a hard to run with. The girl made a cosplay, from scratch, in four days, with no prior experience.
N🆗ri (Marisa): well it could be doable. most grade schools in japan have home ec/sewing classes
N🆗ri (Marisa): one of my middle school students would bring in aprons and stuff she made in school that day
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): in Japan, you're just born with the innate sense of sewing and crafting skills
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): cosplay is a natural instinct
N🆗ri (Marisa): is this 707
Bill: yes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which of his crossplays is he going to choose?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yes
N🆗ri (Marisa): doesnt look like seven anymore rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): power of glasses
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Thanks was seven for sure
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): two girls?
Aldus Larian (Jess): wow hes aiming high
Bill: They both friends. Astounding for anime I know.
Bill: ~~One might be getting a crush but she better for him than the girl he trying to get by being a normie~~
Bill: Yo I sympathize though. What the fuck do people without hobbies *do* with themselves.
Bill: I couldn't pretend to not be the obsessive *fandom obsessed super nerd* I am if I tried.
Bill: 
Bill: Alright I take back my 10 chapter complaint, I'm enjoying the fuck outta this.
Bill: I'm out of chapters and I'm sade.

N🆗ri (Marisa): are you caught up on gekkan shoujo nozaki-kun
Bill: I... was. But I’m look for toradora elk, characters that are friends and not romantic interests at first.
N🆗ri (Marisa): toradora was  more like slavery than friendship <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Prft

N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a hint of a relationship forming in kusuriya no hitorigoto that starts out as a strained friendship
