Dirty Lego (Tom): <@301927856240459777> saw there's a Steven universe movie coming, dunno if that's new news or not
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye!! It was announced at SDCC last year, that’s why a lot of people were confused over the recent season finale. It seemed like a series finale but there’s still one more season and a movie left and no one knows what they’ll be about
Bill: Boy it hard to enjoy SAO these days.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah I'm not even gonna touch it
Dirty Lego (Tom): I don't think I wanna watch like... Any isekai at all anymore
Bill: Aliceization is just. All over the place. In its themes, in the writing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Want to go fight to the death over there?”
“Ok.”
It’s great when OP characters know how ridiculously strong they are.
