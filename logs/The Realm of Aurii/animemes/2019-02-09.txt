Dirty Lego (Tom): Woooooag
Dirty Lego (Tom): I wanna see one
N🆗ri (Marisa): They cool
Just try to get a seat as close to the center of the stage as you can, otherwise when they walk to the other side of the stage they fade a bit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not just vocaloids, it happened with Pearl and Marina too owo
Dirty Lego (Tom): Woahhhh
Dirty Lego (Tom): Really
N🆗ri (Marisa): The school bell being k pop is really funny
Dirty Lego (Tom): 🙏
Bill: <@!351785752197201920>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Horu herself
Bill: She wise.
Tikur (Kurtis): 
Tikur (Kurtis): 
Bill: Where does one find adult Takagi tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s a manga about her married adult life
Bill: ... why I have not seen this.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Karakai Jouzu no (Moto) Takagi-san
Bill: Speaking of manga updates... Deku is bullshit now.
Bill: I need a better manga app.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah I haven’t liked how slow the story’s been recently and they could’ve handled all that new stuff a lot better
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bring back gentle and la brava
Bill: That was fun, if meaningless.
Bill: Bnha has issues.
Bill: Needs a quality injection of Darker and Edgier.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think it’s cuz of the popularity. They’re dragging it on forever, it’s like the new Naruto or one piece. Prime time TV slot and front and center magazine publishing. Plus poor Horikoshi has to churn out a chapter every week, he probably has no time to plan
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s even published unfinished chapters smh
N🆗ri (Marisa): Animal Land was so good too until the ending made no sense and got stereotypical Shounen. By the maker of Zatch Bell. Was so promising.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Have you read the BNHA spinoffs they’re a little edgier and darker
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s two main spin offs, I think the darker one is Vigilantes
Bill: Ye.
Bill: I mean. I’d rather use the setting for a tabletop game and add my own edge.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I actually knew that adult takagi was a manga somehow
Dirty Lego (Tom): The top one is Sao?
Dirty Lego (Tom): She looks familiar but idk why
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah that’s Suzuha right. Or whatever Leafa’s real name is
