Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): A collaboration store is when a store has a tie-in event with the anime! Like imagine if Hot Topic became 100% code gesss themed with posters and decorations and cosplaying staff, and sold exclusive code geass merch you can only buy for a short amount of time
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): *who did this*
Why are the shelves unorganized
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): The Kaleido Star DVDs are next to the FLCL manga but the box for the DVDs is in between hetalia manga and a chobits DVD so what’s in the box if the DVDs aren’t  :0
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Place ur bets
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): OOoo yeah that makes sense, thank!
