Nokri (Marisa): a show of affection
Aldus (Jess): 45 mins till next chat room, what do? Stay up or take nap 🤔

Aldus (Jess): Ray's not doing too well right now but thanks fit asking
Nokri (Marisa): ^^^
Nokri (Marisa): he's in a little bit of a crisis
Aldus (Jess): Kinda shobed in some proverbial dark corner
Nokri (Marisa): why can't these bois be happy
Aldus (Jess): thats the good shit
Nokri (Marisa): WOAH genderswap yess
Aldus (Jess): cuz thats a official image im going to just convince myself that eventually they are both happy
Nokri (Marisa): happily ever after ~~with only a few dozen casualties~~
Aldus (Jess): dont worry about that!
Aldus (Jess): Ok so I'm pretty sure I used to draw this exact speech bubble on stuff in my super dark and edgey teen phase
Nokri (Marisa): are you saying you have a saeran personality deep within
Nokri (Marisa): i like how ray's chatrooms were perfectly normal but saeran's have to be so edgy that the screen changes and the background is different. if ray's were normal you know he's doing that on purpose.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): tats my background at home!
Aldus (Jess): even in the first 4 days when ray hacks the messenger his code is green
Nokri (Marisa): yee, a few in the later days are normal though. i think. i know at least one is because i was like "oh it's normal. huh."
Nokri (Marisa): someone made a thing!! i started doing this like a year ago by editing screenshots but never finished them. i wonder if they're still on my computer.
Aldus (Jess): my game glitched and says a saeran text was ray but all i could see was "I'll get you!"
Nokri (Marisa): they are owo
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): oh no. he's gonna get you.
Aldus (Jess): ~~a cold glass of water~~
Aldus (Jess): OMG THATS ADORABLE
Aldus (Jess): I LOVES THEM
Nokri (Marisa): *kiss kiss fall in mysterious messages*
Aldus (Jess): every time i ray heart now i just imaging him screaming in the back of saerans head
Nokri (Marisa): that last fanart i posted looks suspiciously similar to FFAK's artstyle. hmm. i doubt kosmic would draw fanart but it's discerning.
Nokri (Marisa): saeran: "I hate you."
MC: "I know Ray is still there somewhere!"
saeran: "shut down"
ray: "DOKI DOKI"
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Nokri (Marisa): shut down i meant shut up omg
Aldus (Jess): lmao its ok it works either way
Nokri (Marisa): meanwhile in an alternate timeline
Aldus (Jess): Saeran: "im not gonna feed you"
MC: *dumps arsenal of granola bars out of her purse* "yea so what? your route only got 3 days left i can do this"
Nokri (Marisa): eat the flowers from ray
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Nokri (Marisa): cronch
Aldus (Jess): *makes tea*
Nokri (Marisa): the true ending of this route is become such a devout buddhist you can meditate away from saeran's screaming
Aldus (Jess): LMAO
Aldus (Jess): i like how when the personality switched seven was like "whelp now hes messy af"
Nokri (Marisa): imagine them hacking but using voice to text apps
Aldus (Jess): oh god
Nokri (Marisa): it's one of those girly mousepads
but with zen
Nokri (Marisa): im
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): there are two different seven ones, and there's one for Sans
Elfriede (Tom): Amazing
Elfriede (Tom): I feel like Zen would be the only one with boobs that big though 👌
Nokri (Marisa): ~~bigger than jaehee?~~
Aldus (Jess): omg sen and jaehee compete for biggest boobs
Nokri (Marisa): jaehee would forfeit
Elfriede (Tom): Elizabeth for biggest oppai
Nokri (Marisa): actually rika or echo girl probably win
Nokri (Marisa): catfight
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): that glam choi girl had some titties too
Aldus (Jess): MC got like the smallest tits in the whole game but all the bois wanter her anyway
Nokri (Marisa): basically everyone except MC ~~which is why MC is the best to cosplay~~
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah prob Rika
Nokri (Marisa): the verdict is in. thanks tom.
Aldus (Jess): ~~aw i just imagined mc getting all shy around v cuz her titty to smol and vs like oh noes pplz dont feels bad~~
Nokri (Marisa): that's why it took him like 2 years to come to terms with MC
Aldus (Jess): opps
Aldus (Jess): V pls
Elfriede (Tom): http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/34200000/Rika-Furude-Gif-rileyferguson-34237675-500-280.gif
Aldus (Jess): thats such a typical artist thing to do though in media, they always taking their self discvoery trips
Nokri (Marisa): wrong rika <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): Right rika <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): ~~i mean if anyone need time to discover themselves shouldnt it be saeran~~
Elfriede (Tom): If post the gif of her. stabbing herself in the head but children don't need to see that

Elfriede (Tom): *says mystic messenger doesn't require odd time investments* 
*Sets 2 alarms for the middle of the night so doesn't miss chat rooms*
Bill: Your comments fall on deaf ears.
Aldus (Jess): IT WAS ONLY ONE i satyed up till 2 ad woke up at 7

Nokri (Marisa): yay i got one hourglass ~~after spending 15 😭~~
Aldus (Jess): 🙏
Aldus (Jess): oh i think theyll give you more if you play the game the whole event?
Aldus (Jess): not sure tho
Nokri (Marisa): ooo i hope so. mega hourglass bonus
Aldus (Jess): you gotta save marshmallow boi you can let edgelord win
Nokri (Marisa): oh whaaat
i unlocked another chat but i did this one earlier too. rude.
Aldus (Jess): 😢
Aldus (Jess): nooo that sumb
Bill: Men like to fix up cars, Women like to fix up men. Go figure.
Nokri (Marisa): ok i has 72% now (and -29 hourglasses aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
Nokri (Marisa): well they can always be farmed from the april fools event
Nokri (Marisa): OH NEW SUMMER CHATS WOO
Aldus (Jess): biru u like to fix cars? ow thats great
Nokri (Marisa): ~~just like seven oh seven~~
Aldus (Jess): YAY edgelord no win today
Bill: ~~I know it’s not a perfect analogy but it was witty~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~at least i dont wanna fix real men~~
Bill: I originally pegged my closest match to Seven, but I was thinking it probably Jumin.
Aldus (Jess): fiction men ill fix all day, real men i aint got time for
Aldus (Jess): who else is left for summer chats? seven and who else?
Nokri (Marisa): 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): maybe group chats with everyone?
Nokri (Marisa): vandy?
Nokri (Marisa): the antagonists of other routes?
Nokri (Marisa): tom
Aldus (Jess): VANDY OMG
Nokri (Marisa): we've had zen, yoosung, jumin, jaehee, ray, rika, V, ~~and today's. i just need the last one ahhh~~
Aldus (Jess): saeran? like we had unkown and ray so maybe? but that would be like alot of da boi
Nokri (Marisa): OH YEAH we had unknown too! wait then i've got one person extra
Nokri (Marisa): zen talked about his abs
V talked about his camera
jaehee talked about her swimsuit
unknown talked about AC
Ray talked about ice cream
rika was harsh and abandoned V for being bald
Nokri (Marisa): did we have yoosung??
Aldus (Jess): maybe not? i feel like he was first tho
Nokri (Marisa): yeah he had the starfish sunburn
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Nokri (Marisa): oh wait how many days has it been. hmm. i forgot it started in july not august 1st
Nokri (Marisa): so yeah yoosung and jumin
Aldus (Jess): its 9 for you 8 for me
Aldus (Jess): so there should be one more
Aldus (Jess): im asuming tomorow is seven
Nokri (Marisa): yee 8)
so all that's left for the last day would be a big group chat (most likely), or side characters, or saeran
Nokri (Marisa): ooo i just got the third chat
Aldus (Jess): also dang rika way to be savage
Nokri (Marisa): yoosung just posted an emoji but he's not in the chat. what.
Aldus (Jess): im thinking its gotta be poeple that have already been in chats so im thinking either searan or everyone
Aldus (Jess): WHAT
Aldus (Jess): ghost yoosung
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH LIKE BOI YOU'RE NOT EVEN ON THE LIST OF PARTICIPANTS
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE YOU JUST THREW IN AN UNRELATED EMOJI
Aldus (Jess): *prays for happy saeran, not edgelord saeran*
Aldus (Jess): hes on invisible mode
Aldus (Jess): do you think unknown and edgelord searan are similar?
Aldus (Jess): i think they are but then again unknown seemed to be more "come with me princess ill treat you well, only look at me" and edgelord is like "i hate you bitch, lemme torture you"
Nokri (Marisa): a little. they're the closest in personality. edgelord is more screamy and has an inferiority complex. yeah, unknown seems like an evolved version since he exists two years in the future. he probably got over his complex.
Aldus (Jess): YEA ok that would make sense
Aldus (Jess): also explains the common edgy cloths
Aldus (Jess): wow thats interesting
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah, the one closest to seven is marisa
Nokri (Marisa): wot
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): i have a fear of high places space is too far
Aldus (Jess): unknown is always overly calm and confident so yea evolved would make sense
Nokri (Marisa): it's like pokeyman
ray --> saeran --> unknown
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): WHO
Nokri (Marisa): who
Aldus (Jess): what, did someone hack the game and get summer chats early
Nokri (Marisa): oooooooooo naw that's from last year
Nokri (Marisa): the one year anniversary event
Aldus (Jess): OH OK
Nokri (Marisa): i was trying to remember what other chats there used t obe
Aldus (Jess): ooo neato
Nokri (Marisa): i know you can turn on uhhhhh whats it called. signatures. yeahh
Elfriede (Tom): Creeyus has drawn over 1300 drawing of c.c.

Someone needs to check to make sure this dude is okay
Nokri (Marisa): YOU CAN CHANGE THE TEXT NOTIFICATION SOUNDS AND ONE OF THEM IS JUST SAERAN GOING "BLEHH"
Aldus (Jess): OMG LMAO
Nokri (Marisa): THERE'S A SOUND CLIP OF JAEHEE GOING "I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU" IN ENGLISH
Nokri (Marisa): RIKA SINGING LIGHT AND DAFFODILS
Nokri (Marisa): HOW DID I NEVER FIND THIS BEFORE
Aldus (Jess): My phone's always on vibrate
Nokri (Marisa): if you get time later
or maybe if we're able to voice chat in the future because it looks like a lot of these sound clips are unlockables from the different events. i can play them over the speaker. there's one of ray saying "i love you" in korean over and over, but most of them i can't understand because korean.
Nokri (Marisa): I think one is of jaehee continuing the taco song?
Nokri (Marisa): there's one of every character just saying "Mystic Messenger" but with an accent it's really funny
Nokri (Marisa): zen going "zenny zen zen"
Aldus (Jess): Ommggggg
Nokri (Marisa): yoosung sneezing
Aldus (Jess): Ahhhhh! Lmao
Nokri (Marisa): jaehee saying "ding dong" WHY ARE THESE HERE
Nokri (Marisa): one of zen.... meowing?? or going like "hnnneu" or something idk
Nokri (Marisa): i was originally looking for the april fools signature option but it looks like that's gone 😭
Aldus (Jess): Who speaks Korean? We need a translator
Aldus (Jess): Awwww
Nokri (Marisa): *i will learn korean*
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): wrong route
Aldus (Jess): I wonder if you get a ray broken heart for that one
Nokri (Marisa): ***don't do it***
Elfriede (Tom): MAKE HIM JEALOUS
Nokri (Marisa): ***NO***
Nokri (Marisa): oo maybe the signature option is only available in the april fools dlc menu
