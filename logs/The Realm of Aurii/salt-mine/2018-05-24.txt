Afina (Georgia🍀): for reference
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeahh was always a fan of a bunch if the elementalist forms
Afina (Georgia🍀): dark elementalist is SO HOT I CANNOT
Afina (Georgia🍀): but all that purple would be so fun to cosplay
Eliran (Halim): ~~I'll be the light elementalist to your dark~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ;3c
Afina (Georgia🍀): new group cosplay, the different lux outfits
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeeeeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): tom you can be the mystic one
Nokri (Marisa): mystic..........................m..esegn.rrr..??
Aldus (Jess): ~~thats totally not what I was thinking at all~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yo das fab tho
Bill: breath of the wild link nenodroid is on sale.
Bill: Tell me not to.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Do ey
Bill: *You right*
Bill: done.
Bill: related, the design for Zelda in Hyrule Warriors is *amazing* and constantly makes me want for a Zelda game about Zelda.
Bill: 
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah it good, I like her blue motif in botw more though
Bill: Nah, I dig that for link but the eyebrows.
Bill: Though her outfit in one of the flashbacks is baller.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 
Bill: oooh, never saw that outfit for Link.
Bill: Think this is the one.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Oof not really digging that one
Bill: best one from that game. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): In terms of outfits for zelda
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Never played it lol
Aldus (Jess): i love her regualr outfit
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Same
Aldus (Jess): for botw
Aldus (Jess): ~~its actually practical~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I like her robes from breath, good stuff
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Idk, just based on the sass I know she has in that game, it just doesn't seem fitting
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And her regular
Bill: It works in the scenes she's in.
Bill: Kinda contrasts her sass cause blah responsibilities.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah she really doesn't even seem like she really wants to be the princess in that game, but she wants to save everybody and is frustrated that she isn't able to
Bill: ~~But she is once again a 'rescue me' dragonball the whole game so who gives a shit~~
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): True. Idk the context of those scenes lol
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Most personality they gave her out of all the games at least
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): But yeah, I hope they give her a separate game that she deserves
Bill: I suppose.
Bill: Not enough for me.
Bill: My theory is a steampunk Hyrule, where wisdom is more important than courage. She's the one who has to help Courage that time around.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Oooo interesting!!!
Bill: So more emphasis on puzzles, conversation, politicing gangs or what have you, with combat shuffled in.
Bill: Also tried to come up with a tabletop storyline for a Zelda campaign, but it's *hard* to split the lore from the main trio.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): That seems like a really interesting concept tho
Bill: Nintendo'll never do it though.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah I'd def take a game with Zelda as the protag
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): I mean there's plan talk of it since 2010 I wanna say. So Nintendo has debated it, and might honestly pull through. No saying how long it'll take tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://instagram.com/p/BiPxTSVh3Ee/
Afina (Georgia🍀): We should all do this when we have our league cosplays 😜
Bill: Why does her head look so large tho.
Bill: like, it's an optics thing, I just can't tell how.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wig probably doesn't help
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: lmao the like four times she says demacia
