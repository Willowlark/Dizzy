Bill: Pink Weiss reskin is nice.
Bill: How'd you find the rest of the mechanics to cross tag Tom?
Bill: Feels like there's still a good amount of content in the team mechanics.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: did you do the tutorial?
Bill: yeah, both basic and advanced.
Bill: I can't remember everything now though. üòÖ
Bill: I‚Äôll bring the switch tomorrow. Can‚Äôt play (unless it has single joy con mode) but can talk.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: yeah i havent fully grasped everything either tbh, just stuff that translates over from other fighters
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: https://twitter.com/SunhiLegend/status/1003670007925104641
Bill: Nier dlc when.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: ‚ù§
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: It's inportant to note that when doing the combo trials
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: That's not exactly how the game will play. Like you don't HAVE to do 3 light attack or 3 heavys
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: You can do 2 if it's easier and stuff
Bill: The jump cancels and switching to crouch were the hard parts.
Bill: So you can in fact play with a single joycon. It‚Äôs... not ideal, but doable.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: i mean with this game its relatively ez
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: my team is going to def be Makoto Yang
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: when she comes out
Bill: It‚Äôs not ideal just do to the size of the control for quick inputs.
Bill: Like, Hyrule Warriors on a single joy con is fine.
Bill: Fighting game is tougher.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: yeahh
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: yo makoto has shadow clones nani
Bill: Ranga has a sword scythe. Copyrights everywhere.
Bill: I like Weiss, Blake is pretty cool. Worried I won‚Äôt be able to make use of Weiss‚Äôs trap mechanic though.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Yeah balke his her trpa mechanic too lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Yo Makoto has an instant unblockable combo starter for 1 meter for reasons
Bill: Hers seems a bit easier.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: oh
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: and a demi infinite as long as you have meter
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: nani
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: makoto is broke
Bill: You mean Chie?
Bill: Also, can‚Äôt decide if I like dpad or stick better. Jumps are easier on dpad, spins are easier on stick.
Bill: Though that‚Äôs just for trials AND I GOT ANOTHER ONE WOO
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: wooop just the resonance one right?
Bill: Yeah, which is bullshit cause it starts attacking from a jump with a two hit air.
Bill: It‚Äôs harder to hit that than anything else in the chain.

Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: But nah I gotta pack some stuff... Or at least try to
Bill: Am I tom if I‚Äôm playing fighting games when I should be sleeping?
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): YEAH
Aldus (Jess): ...
Bill: FUCK. Why is the play sample button pressing in on the movement stick?
Bill: alright, time to be me and sleep.
Bill: I watched a trailer for the new Mario Tennis.
Bill: You can play as a chain chomp.
Bill: That's awesome.
Dave: A new tennis game!?
Dave: I loved the one that was on GameCube
Bill: same.
Bill: I'm going to get it.
Bill: It's swtich only I believe though.
Bill: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-06-07/disgaea-1-complete-game-promo-video-features-story/.132568 <@!351785752197201920> want a switch yet?
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: It's on PC too <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: But switch is the nostalgia machine.
Bill: They just keep remaking everything I loved once.
Nokri (Marisa): oh they did the fullmetal alchemist theme song too
Nokri (Marisa): wait wrong channel
