Bill: Ah, Vent.
Bill: Well.
Nokri (Marisa): OwO
Bill: Thanks for inputting Mawisa.
Nokri (Marisa): Consultation fee $500
Bill: 🙄
Bill: You're lucky we love you.
Nokri (Marisa): Pls send cash within 5 to 7 business days thank
Dizzy: *swings the hammer, but is pulled down by it's weight!*
Bill: !ban
Afina (Georgia🍀): wow thats crazy tho
Bill: And serious.
Aldus (Jess): Uggg I wanna say something but...
Bill: is it not in utmost sympathy?
Nokri (Marisa): You can say it here as a test run <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): No I mean I wanna say something like I hope she's ok. Like I dont know the whole situation but I don't ever want anyone to do that
Aldus (Jess): I feel weird being silent but I don't think I he anything to contribute
Bill: Go say it. nothing wrong with being supportive.
Nokri (Marisa): Point up emoji
Bill: There is something wrong with making stupid jokes, and I just had to stop myself from my third one. It's how I deal damnit.
Nokri (Marisa): I don't know the situation or the people involved at all so I'm hoping it doesn't backfire
Afina (Georgia🍀): calling the police for a wellness visit is pretty good as far as keeping situations under control
Nokri (Marisa): ye i'm not worried about the police aspect (~~hopefully my cousin isn't the one going out though he's not the greatest for wellness checks based on comments i've heard him make~~)
more about the family's reaction and mist's reaction if she's alright
Bill: wrong one. Snow. Mist is the other force in this mess.
Nokri (Marisa): o
Nokri (Marisa): oo
Aldus (Jess): Yes snow and mist are both very dangerous fources of nature
Nokri (Marisa): earth has so many people
Aldus (Jess): They are both forms of water tho they should get along
Bill: well, crisis averted.
Nokri (Marisa): depending on her relationship with her family it could cause some tension, and if she knows who called the police it could cause tension with them
Bill: it might, but by all accounts Snow is a bloody drama queen. She'll eat this up.
Bill: Maybe her parents can knock some sense into her if she spills all this Mist crap out.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i was GONNA SAY i hope this isnt just her being overdramatic
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause these kinda things are serious
Nokri (Marisa): ^
Afina (Georgia🍀): like "you shouldnt joke about these things"
Bill: If she was being overdramatic, I'm openly done with her. ☝ that's exactly the reason I'll give.
Nokri (Marisa): ye i don't know the person at all so based on everyone's reactions in the other chat i assumed it was wholly serious but there was that lingering apprehension it was all blown out of proportion
~~is this ok to say now that she's confirmed safe~~
Bill: yeah.
Afina (Georgia🍀): welllll its hard to rule that shes being overdramatic
Bill: Here at least.
Afina (Georgia🍀): but yeah im kinda done-zo too
Bill: We have no idea. If it was serious, I imagine the cop wouldn't have been like 'everything is fine'.
Aldus (Jess): Honestly I think I feel the worst for Leanna
Bill: *VERY MUCH* so.
Nokri (Marisa): the cop talked to her parents as well, which if there was a situation wouldn't be much of a priority (especially for someone over 18) (they might've answered the door really confusedly)
Bill: Leanna is a good person. She's caught up in some serious nonsense.
Aldus (Jess): She seems to really like her alot and I can't imagine what she's been going through the past few hours
Bill: Exactly.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~i cant imagine why more like~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): oof sorry
Bill: Another reason if this is overdramatic, I'm done. Leanna doesn't deserve to be strung out like that.
Aldus (Jess): ~~i also hope Leanna doesn't now feel pressure to stay with her even if she isn't happy with the relationship for fear of snow doing something~~
Bill: Well, I think Leanna is happy with the relationship thus far.
Afina (Georgia🍀): thus far
Bill: Don't think we're at that point.
Aldus (Jess): Yea I think so too I just consider these things
Bill: which is a good thing.
Aldus (Jess): It's alot to take on for someone
Bill: It's foresight into future problems.
Afina (Georgia🍀): its so EARLY in the relationship tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): im lowkey surprised
Bill: some people go into relationships at different levels.
Nokri (Marisa): relationships are funky
Aldus (Jess): She could still be happy with Leanna just not happy overall
Aldus (Jess): If she has a mental illness, that could easily takeiver any happiness her relationship was bringing her
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i mean im highkey more worried about leanna
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause it seems like snow is stable, shes under watch by her parents now too
Bill: Leanna is also a little, what, neurotic? Dealing with this could hurt her more than Snow.
Aldus (Jess): I mean I'm worried about both of them, I don't want to see anyone do that even if they did contribute to drama. But yea def worried for Leanna cuz she seems to be a very caring person I'm and I hope she doesn't see this as a failure on her part
Aldus (Jess): They night admit her to the hospital also
Nokri (Marisa): snow? or leanna?
Aldus (Jess): Oh snow
Nokri (Marisa): oo, the police would've taken care of that if needed. if there was any chance whatsoever she might harm herself they'd of taken her to the hospital
Aldus (Jess): Yea
Bill: Why would Snow want her scythe back.
Bill: She's leaving the cosplay community, apparently. Hell, the mortal plane if the note was taken at face value.
Bill: What does she need a prop scythe for?
Nokri (Marisa): sell on facebook $$$
Afina (Georgia🍀): huh weird
Aldus (Jess): ~~bury me with my cosplay~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): BURY ME IN PYRRHA
Afina (Georgia🍀): GOIN OUT WITH A PHOTOSHOOT
Bill: no.
Nokri (Marisa): so majestic
Afina (Georgia🍀): im not dying FOR pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): if i happen to die tho
Nokri (Marisa): get ready quick before the rigor mortis sets in
Nokri (Marisa): while you're still posable
Nokri (Marisa): owo
Aldus (Jess): Omg no I shouldn't be laughing right now
Bill: Still no.
Nokri (Marisa): if someone is suicidal and not listening to reason try to talk them down by saying what a pain hospital suicide watches are
can't even have your phone charger with you smh
Nokri (Marisa): is snow not snow.cosplay? is that a different snow
Aldus (Jess): Na that's different
Nokri (Marisa): ooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye that diff
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye i called the police once for someone who was trying to attempt suicide
Afina (Georgia🍀): he wasnt in danger but they put him in some kinda care facility for like a week
Aldus (Jess): Yea. Same.
Nokri (Marisa): ye, inpatient stuff might be different but outpatient programs suck
Bill: I have not. Clearly I must keep all of you knuckleheads safe and happy.
Aldus (Jess): ~~i had talked him down like 3 times~~
Nokri (Marisa): despite being monitored 24/7 you can't have phone chargers because they're a choking hazard
but iphone chargers are like 3 inches long pls
Aldus (Jess): Yeaaaa
Aldus (Jess): Oof we getting heavy tonight
Nokri (Marisa): how about this instead
Aldus (Jess): Perfect
