Bill: Going to bed, work in the morning.
Bill: Both of them are in overmemes, they got tagged from that.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): working on cosplay and something for school now
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): possibly later
Eliran (Halim): oh i didn't think georgia would be in overmemes since she doesn't have it for PC
Bill: shit you right.
Bill: I fucked up.
Eliran (Halim): hmmm  gotta write a post
Bill: So does everyone but Georgia.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Throw back to before Georgia played league and was listening to me and Hal play,and Everytime Yasou threw his hurricane she asked who got ganked
Eliran (Halim): in this game it was the Yasou
Eliran (Halim): I mcganked the yas a bunch
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): #tbt <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Eliran (Halim): he'd throw his hurrican and miss cause kindred got mad hops
Eliran (Halim): his wind wall was hard to gank through tho
Bill: Cross tag comes out tomorrow.
Bill: Damn.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Yup!
Bill: Jared getting it too?
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I don't think so but he's easily convinced to buy fighting games
Bill: I'm going to hate it, why am I excited.
Bill: Given it ain't cheap either.
Bill: 9 unannounced DLC characters?
Bill: tbh I should probably get it for switch...
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I heard that none are gonna be rwby dlc
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Idk how true that is
Bill: Saw something like that, they data mined the switch demo and found 3 in each of the other games.
Bill: Which is believable, but *dumb*.
Bill: Then again RT should just be paying for a full rwby game.
Bill: I'm not getting the deluxe edition anyway, I'll see what the DLC characters are first.
Bill: but yeah, I'll probably play it more on switch, but then I can't play with you...
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: But let's be honest
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Do you *really* want to play with me?
Bill: Kinda? yes, I'll lose ~~most~~ all the time, but I only play games to play with friends these days.
Dave: Just don't rage quit. ~~And uninstall overwatch like tom~~
Bill: I got the switch version. I'll have to get PC or get together with Tom to play.
Bill: But at least I'll be able to play on the train and practice.
