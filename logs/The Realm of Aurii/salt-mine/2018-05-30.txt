Afina (Georgia🍀): im logged on, just getting some cereal
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I killed it ;)
Bill: News was yesterday, but lets go pokemon eh?
Nokri (Marisa): the rumors were truuue
Bill: I'm not sure if it's Pokemon Go from the couch, Hey you pikachu 2, or an actual pokemon game.
Nokri (Marisa): it seems like a spin-off. there are no wild pokemon battles, you just throw the ball at wild pokemon but you can't fight them from what i've heard. since it's kanto and only gen 1 is in the game it'll probably rely on pokemon go for pokedex stuff.
Nokri (Marisa): there are fights but it's more a pokemon colosseum type thing
Bill: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/05/30/new-core-pokmon-rpg-planned-for-switch-in-second-half-of-2019 so not a main game for switch, but Eevee so that's okay. WTF is pokemon quest, minecraft?
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> apparently there’s a tekken tourney on... Monday?
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): oo someone said the dates for the sheduale are messed up or something
Bill: I dunno, it's definitely friday or saturday...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Huhhh
Aldus (Jess): tekken tournament is Saturday at 6-9 babe <@!351785752197201920>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: WOOOO
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <@245270932602486784> fallout <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ?
Aldus (Jess): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ye84Zrqndo
Bill: aaaah nice.
Bill: fuck ye.
Bill: Watch it be a mobile game somehow.
Aldus (Jess): probably XD
Bill: Or a dating sim where you never leave the vault.
Bill: How many different ways can it not be a new full game?
Aldus (Jess): more ways to kill my phone battery opps
Nokri (Marisa): fallout minecraft
Aldus (Jess): LMAO fallout dating sim. mg the fanboys would riot
Bill: DLC: vault opens and you can boink Danse.
Afina (Georgia🍀): NANI WHAT IS THIS BETHESDA
Bill: What we expected.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I don't want another mobile game that I'll only play for 3 days
Bill: I reserve my hype for when they say what kind of game it is.
Aldus (Jess): lol there nothing saying its a mobile game yet
Bill: Ye I’m just being pessimistic.
Bill: Graphics don’t look super different from four?
Bill: Same engine?
Aldus (Jess): hmm kotaku is speculating online game
Nokri (Marisa): is that the kotaku article where the guy in the comments is like "source?"
asking for a source on their speculations
Bill: ew.
Aldus (Jess): its like super short but: https://kotaku.com/bethesda-announces-fallout-76-1826417383
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ew online don't like that either
Afina (Georgia🍀): _give me my lonely RPGs_
Nokri (Marisa): aww no there was one a few hours ago before the announcement where they were speculating what it could be and were like "fans think it could possibly be x, y , and z but there is no confirmation" and the only comment was like "do you have a source for that"
Aldus (Jess): oh lmao
Aldus (Jess): yea i dont want an online game either
Aldus (Jess): gimme single player rpg plz
Afina (Georgia🍀): Can't wait for the solider 76 and Fallout mashup now
Bill: ~~we'll still all play it though~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~for like 2 weeks and then leave it~~
Bill: ~~Squad goals tho~~
Bill: More builder that fallout 4? Like Fallout: the Sims/Civ5?
Aldus (Jess): my hopes cant get any lower XD
Bill: 
Bill: to be fair, Kotaku could just be trying to start shit.
Aldus (Jess): yeeee
Bill: ```A press release sent out by Bethesda said Fallout 76 is in development at Bethesda Game Studios on PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One. We expect to learn more during this year’s E3 in Los Angeles. Bethesda has its own press conference, called BE3, scheduled for Sunday, June 10, at 6:30 p.m. PT. It’s the publisher’s fourth dedicated E3 even```
Bill: Was ESO cross platform?
Bill: maybe that's a good sign.
Aldus (Jess): nah ESO isnt
Afina (Georgia🍀): THANK GOD PS4
Aldus (Jess): why wouldn't it be?
Bill: if it was an online game?
Bill: I'd see that being just PC.
Aldus (Jess): i guess
Bill: that's some fast fanarting.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeet
Bill: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=fallout%2076&_dyncharset=UTF-8&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All%20Categories&ks=960&keys=keys&ref=199&loc=FKSJxY2VJAk&acampID=1&siteID=FKSJxY2VJAk-aW7qnxujviGjLyKopvOI2A you can already preorder it.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Pfft meme
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/natgeotravel/videos/10155837462478992/ *If they were androids, they could do that on heels*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That would be classic triple a though wouldn't it? 
>Community: hey can we have NV2 OR AT LEAST 1 OR 2 REMASTER? OR! FALLOUT 1 REMADES AS A FIRST PERSON?!
>Bethesda: how about an online fallout 🙃
Bill: in reality, they could get away with a fallout 1 or 2 remake.
Bill: So few people know about the original games these days.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah, I was kinda hoping
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Tbh the trailer was nothing flashy
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I liked the song but everything was game rendering and didn't really show anything other than a vault
Bill: yup. Hype reserved for the actual info.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The song in the background is "Almost Heaven, West Virginia"
Afina (Georgia🍀): So that might be our location right there
Afina (Georgia🍀): My military buddy sent me that fact just now lol
Bill: ye. That's basically confirmed by prior lore about Vault 76.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao yeah I figured as soon as I heard the song
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Everyone knows that song 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~oops~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It better be a single player
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'mma kick thier ass
Afina (Georgia🍀): ILL KICK THEIR OTHER ASS I want single player
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YEAH
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: DONT DO ME DIRTY BETH BABY
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: The author of the kataku article is talking shit on Twitter saying he's right
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Will see
Bill: yeah, I don't trust it.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Idk it may not be traditional
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Single player rpg, but maybbbbe it's close?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I really hope they don't fuck it up, but I'll hold judgement til the conference
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~For Bethesda to disappoint me again~~
Bill: I have seen so many different reactions to pokemon lets go from people. Gabel is freaking out, Eve is skeptical, Eric is begrudgingly excited...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ashley is ready to kill them too, we'll all meet up after the star gaurdian shoot for a group cey
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: The conference is sat of a next I believe
Bill: Bethesda?
Bill: Yeah, it is.
Bill: 6:30 pacific, so like 11pm.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah
Bill: I'm seeing rumors of a class based shooter like overmemes, but I'm not sure fallout can really work with that.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nah guys I got it
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's a fighting game
Bill: ~~dark souls: fallout edition~~
Bill: ```we've gone from wanting a 3 remaster to getting a new game to finding out its online to wishing we got the remaster.

fan fucking tastic```
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah..
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 
Bill: *kid*
Bill: *nani*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She also says kid
Aldus (Jess): you mean billy isnt the only person that can call people kid?
Bill: she's like, younger than us isn't she though?
Bill: star guardians is the last thing of the day though, intentionally.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She's the same age
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Maybe 23?
Bill: whoop.
Aldus (Jess): every time you call someone kid you age a year
Bill: RIP I'm dead.
Bill: No photos for anyone.
Aldus (Jess): RIP
Bill: But while Georgia and Hal go on their date, hopefully we can I dunno, bond with Ashley and Dan.
Aldus (Jess): toms gotta do dat tekken
Bill: I don't know how that works, but we'll try! (I'd say I'll try, but I think that'd awkward me outta there)
Aldus (Jess): which prob means costume change?
Aldus (Jess): unless hes gonna beat people at tekken as a literal trap
Bill: There's three hours or so between 6pm and the end of star guardians.
Aldus (Jess): whoooo
Bill: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-05-30/sega-reveals-team-sonic-racing-game-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch-pc/.132202 *Whyyyyy?* He can run at the *speed of sound*.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Bill: 20 bucks can net you every arma game.
Afina (Georgia🍀): the fallout trailer has a wooden soldier in the corner of one of the tables
Afina (Georgia🍀): i know it isnt explicitly maccready but thats what he gives your character when you reach max affinity
Bill: Maccready hasn’t been born yet so.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye
Afina (Georgia🍀): the trailer may just be filled with easter eggs and stuff tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): so maybe overanalyzing the contents of the stills could prove to be inaccurate
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: https://kotaku.com/sources-fallout-76-is-an-online-survival-rpg-1826425333
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: This.... Is most likely accurate
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Fak
Afina (Georgia🍀): i dont like it :c
Afina (Georgia🍀): _todd howard you todd ***coward***_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 👆
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ☝
Bill: Kotaku is fucking salty people aren't listening to them though.
Bill: Hilarious.
Afina (Georgia🍀): does that mean it could be online, but not mmo, and be more like borderlands?
Bill: It's going to be like Rust or Ark.
Bill: Building sim where you can kill each other.
Afina (Georgia🍀): :ccccccc
Afina (Georgia🍀): beth u suk
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yep...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'm not hopeful
Afina (Georgia🍀): me neither
Afina (Georgia🍀): RIP
Afina (Georgia🍀): i had been so excited
Bill: don't hype for vague announcements.
Aldus (Jess): lol interest level: 0
Bill: This is about fallout, not league.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ill be optimistic but verrrrrry skeptical
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yep.. idk I think Bethesda dropped the ball. I'm already disappointed and they haven't even showed the game <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Technically none of these sources are confirmed.
Afina (Georgia🍀): honestly if kotaku KEPT THEIR MOUTHES SHUT
Bill: so.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ignorance would have been bliss
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YEAHHH
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I was thinking the same
