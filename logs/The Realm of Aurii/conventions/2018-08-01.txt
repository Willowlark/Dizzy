Dave: 🍻
Nokri (Marisa): going to comiket early vs going later. what do.
if early i'll have to wait several hours in line, and go on a packed train.
if later the trains and lines will be much less but there won't be any spots in the cosplay area. hm.
Aldus (Jess): D:
Nokri (Marisa): it like this
Aldus (Jess): do you has fren?
Nokri (Marisa): ye but they can't go until sunday. we're gonna try and do the magi group!
i might go friday to scope out the place and take pictures, saturday to cosplay mari, and then sunday for magi. I also have to go to the mmk booth on sunday to buy their new publication.
Aldus (Jess): oooo! wuld you have to wait in line all 3 days?
Bill: ~~don't cosplayer there alone~~
Nokri (Marisa): yeah 😭 the con is free, but it costs $8 per day to cosplay so i gotta find where the changing rooms are
Nokri (Marisa): *but its comiket*
Bill: its *comiket*.
Nokri (Marisa): omg this is like prime cosplay real estate right here
Aldus (Jess): do u have like pepper spray?
Bill: how many harem anime have you seen where girl cosplays at comiket only to need Ordinary High School Student boy to save her from the many *creepy* otaku.
Bill: I've seen *a lot*.
Nokri (Marisa): i get more creeps out of cosplay then in cosplay. hm.
i know some cosplayers from acosta events, but i don't think they'd be going to comiket. if pains' group goes that would be nice but they're really cosfamous so i probably couldn't stick around for long.
Nokri (Marisa): i think getting a good spot and getting friendly with neighboring cosplayers is the way to go
Nokri (Marisa): you can see here, at cons the cosplayers just pick a spot and set up camp there and stand there all day. any photographers who want a picture will line up in front of them, so the cosplayers are usually against walls or cones or natural barriers. you'll have your neighbors all day.
Nokri (Marisa): OH AND DISNEY GUY. i dunno if he'd be at comiket ,maybe not, but he's also super popular. rose says he always talks about me when i'm not there yay
Aldus (Jess): thats so scary
Nokri (Marisa): be strong for cosplay jess
Aldus (Jess): id feel so weir
Nokri (Marisa): most cosplayers don't have super long lines like that. i think the most people that lined up for me was like 2
Bill: Justifiable feeling. Marisa needs safety friends. Especially at comiket, the mother of all conventions.
Bill: I mean, have you ever seen that many guys with camera in the US? never.
Nokri (Marisa): cameracon
Aldus (Jess): bring knife
Aldus (Jess): you stab any creeps
Nokri (Marisa): they has a bag check
Elfriede (Tom): Where are the girls with the cameras?
Bill: Pfft.
Nokri (Marisa): they rare
Bill: I feel like they rare here.
Aldus (Jess): where are the boi cosplayers? D:
Nokri (Marisa): they also rare
Bill: Nor would they do 'hall' shots like the comiket setup.
Nokri (Marisa): the boys are dressed as girls
Nokri (Marisa): super convincingly
Aldus (Jess): japan is wild
Bill: ~~but seriously doing a concern, comiket is wild girl~~
Aldus (Jess): yea me too! 😭
Nokri (Marisa): i survived anime japan! kind of!
more people honestly creeped on me out of cosplay then in. 2 years ago i had a guy follow me and try to feel me up when not in cosplay, and this year 2 guys asked for my phone number and one asked for a photoshoot not in cosplay. like. why.

i'll be fine in cosplay <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): mawisa you has to be safe! you has to send messages to let us know you are okay, and and put the japanesse equivilent to 911 in your phone
Nokri (Marisa): 119? :3c
Nokri (Marisa): i be ok!
if i somehow get popular that'd probably be advantageous because the wall of photographers would prevent any one guy from being overly creepy, the others would push him away
Bill: And then that one guy has friends who will help him follow you home. 😑
Bill: Fame is an annoyance, not a perk.
Nokri (Marisa): good luck i'm behind 17 proxies
Bill: *Marisa.*
Nokri (Marisa): that's me!
Bill: You're an adult, you know Japan better than we do, and you've done cons there. Do us a *small* favor and do be careful when you're there so we don't worry over you.
Nokri (Marisa): lol at this cosplayer at an intersection
Nokri (Marisa): okie dokie i try ⭐
Nokri (Marisa): *adult.* uguu.
Bill: *If you weren't an adult we'd drag your ass home*
Bill: That resident evil cosplay is fucking lit.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm pretty sure that's the guy whos eye moves and blinks too
Nokri (Marisa): ~~maybe i could cosplay for all three days~~
Bill: Maybe if you have a *friend* with you.
Bill: *BUDDY SYSTEM*
Nokri (Marisa): i will on sunday! :3
Nokri (Marisa): maybe friday i can wear sheryl's uniform if i can just figure out what shoes she has
Nokri (Marisa): red heels! i have red heels.
Bill: *Then cosplay on sunday and get buddies for fri and saturday*
Nokri (Marisa): do the RFA count as my buddies
Bill: *No*
Bill: Seriously, Yuri guy would have been way creepier if you didn't have your friend with you.
Nokri (Marisa): i can call them anytime for just 5 hourglasses
i don't think yuri guy would've approached us if we weren't together, he didn't get individual shots of us haha
Nokri (Marisa): hehehe do you think it would turn creeps away if i said i had an onii-san
they always ask if you're in the country alone or with a group and i always say i live with people but what if i was like "oh yeah i'm here with my onii-chan"
Nokri (Marisa): start acting like i have a brother complex
Bill: That will probably turn them.
Nokri (Marisa): お兄ちゃんと暮らしています！お兄ちゃんは最高、すごくかっこよくて世界一のお兄ちゃんですわ！
Nokri (Marisa): https://78.media.tumblr.com/d122e340c8f1b75bd78490c4b5a5827c/tumblr_inline_ok5a3ygJu81ueut6r_500.gif
Aldus (Jess): Safety onii-chans
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): 😏
