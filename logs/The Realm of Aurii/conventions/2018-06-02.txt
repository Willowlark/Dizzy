Ienzo (john g): if only i was good enough for that contest
Bill: Do it anyway.
Bill: Hal, you find out work schedule?
Dave: all praise the t-rex
Eliran (Halim): not yet :c
Bill: *serrrrrriously?*
Bill: You charge for the events outside of the christmas one, spend that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats so weird
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: somehow completely missed the video til jes said something <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Nokri (Marisa): me @ every con this year
Afina (Georgia🍀): SIGHHHH everyone is going to otakonnnn
Bill: whose everyone?
Bill: I thought a good portion of our con friend weren't going this year. Mark, Gen and friends, etc.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Everyone on Instagram :c
Bill: I mean, I wanted to go, but no hotels nearby, crazy parking, time off from work, expensive... It's just not worth the effort. I'm going to book it next year, but this year is a just a wash.
Bill: I blame RTX.
Afina (Georgia🍀): RTX is very likely to blame yes lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): And are all the hotels really already booked solid?
Bill: It's two months to the con, anything easy walking would be.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I remember the crapload of hotels by the con center though, huh
Bill: Not to mention Hal can't, you're on vacation, Tom and Jess aren't huge on the travel, Marisa is in japan, so the current group looksl it'd be me and Andrew.
Bill: John and Aaron rock the with Seth and the card gamer gang.
Bill: But also like said before, alot of the people we know aren't going. That's a real downside to me.
Nokri (Marisa): i can tell people i know who are going to look out for you and befriend you
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh yeah I'm on vacation so I can't even go if I wanted lmaooooo forgot
Afina (Georgia🍀): That makes the FOMO less bad
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yo had to look up fomo and im glad that word exists
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: Oh I saw one of those at Katsu. Couldn’t go for some reason.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think its worth a shot goin
Afina (Georgia🍀): hue
Afina (Georgia🍀): A SHOT
Afina (Georgia🍀): HUE HUE
Bill: Find the event link while I’m out?

Aldus (Jess): *shows up in v cosplay* "does this count?"
Aldus (Jess): Oh and Georgia can be Max. That counts too
Aldus (Jess): And we'll be like "oh I thought it was for photographer characters opps"
Bill: Heh, that’s be neat.
Afina (Georgia🍀): omg thatd be hilarious
Aldus (Jess): Right I think it's be great
Afina (Georgia🍀): Con vlog officially uploaded, and YouTube has now officially verified me as Wezrez cosplay YEET

Afina (Georgia🍀): _do i do it, y/n?_

Afina (Georgia🍀): 4 pm on saturday through sunday?
Eliran (Halim): Nah I work Sunday
Afina (Georgia🍀): dAMN no formal what a suck that is
Eliran (Halim): I was thinking
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH
Eliran (Halim): Showing up at 4 on Friday, and Saturday
Bill: And driving back down? Sure you won’t burn out doing that?
Eliran (Halim): Haven't decided if I want to spend the night Friday and drive to work Saturday morning. Or leave Friday at 10ish
Bill: Don’t want you in an accident on the highway.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^^
Eliran (Halim): I'll be eating
Eliran (Halim): Plus I don't start work till 8/9 so I get an actual nights rest
Eliran (Halim): Cause not fasting
Eliran (Halim): I drove back and forth to ota before, this is about the same drive
Afina (Georgia🍀): stupid work
Eliran (Halim): Also tbh if my cosplay arrive like they should
Eliran (Halim): There ain't no way in hell you can tell me I wasted that money not to wear at least one of them for a bit
Eliran (Halim): Plus I wanna be there for formal
Afina (Georgia🍀): /doki
Eliran (Halim): Cause I'm a romantic
Bill: I’m just thinking doing it back to back would suck.
Afina (Georgia🍀): /doki _intensifies_
Bill: If you’re confident that’s fine though.
Eliran (Halim): It stinks, but it's not unmanageable
Afina (Georgia🍀): If you 🐝 🍁 in yourself
Eliran (Halim): Tbh I might stay Friday night and drive to work Saturday morning before y'all get up
Eliran (Halim): Gf cuddles are a wonder for the soul
Afina (Georgia🍀): true facts, they have healing properties
Eliran (Halim): It's a 1.5 hour drive, so it's not to bad 
Especially since I'm eating and all
Eliran (Halim): Which is extremely rejuvenating post fast
Bill: So you’ll stay Friday?
Eliran (Halim): Maybe... it depends on the drive up tbh
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~gotta know for the hotel cut though~~
Eliran (Halim): Assume not, then send me the amount I'd owe everyone individuallyf I did
Eliran (Halim): Hey y'all way in advance but my super awesome friend was wondering if at next zenkai they can room with us
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I read that as bee-canada
Eliran (Halim): What
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 🐝 🍁
Eliran (Halim): Ohhhh
Eliran (Halim): Yeah same
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): (which fren)
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Good stuff
Afina (Georgia🍀): AS LONG AS YOU BEE CANADA
Eliran (Halim): My good high school bud named Jordan
Eliran (Halim): She is a former homestuck, if you remember a Roxy...? With a completely knit dress that's her
Eliran (Halim): She also was like one of the OG Pantskri
Afina (Georgia🍀): NOT PANTSKRI
Eliran (Halim): Like if you went to the draw stuck at Katsu... 4? Years ago, that was her
Eliran (Halim): She's a mutual friend if Mak and I, and was the person who was significant in introducing me to cons
Eliran (Halim): She's a smol kind person who loves to knit all the things
Bill: It’d be helpful if you could decided sooner rather than later Hal, but we’ll run with not staying. I don’t like dealing with money issues at the con. 

Zenkai’s a way off, but I usually want to know the person before I offer them a room Hal. 😅
Afina (Georgia🍀): so you have a year to meet them whoopee
Eliran (Halim): They go to katsu
Eliran (Halim): Also I may do a separate room in the unlikely  scenario you two don't end up meeting. 
But like ya said 
Zenkai is far away
