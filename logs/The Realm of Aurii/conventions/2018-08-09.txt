Bill: Tom, Jess, you guys good spitballing like 11amish for Spicy Messages?
Aldus (Jess): 11 is when da autographs are for the MM but I'm not sure if I'm going to attempt that yet 😬
Bill: nah, then we do another time.
Bill: It's worth trying the events for the VAs. 😃
Aldus (Jess): They have them at 3 on Friday too but RWBY shoot is? 2?
Bill: I don't like, have a schedule for saturday.
Bill: RWBY shoot is 1 to 2.
Bill: Dunno how early you have to be on lines for autographs. Ping Gen in BNE, she's waited on autograph lines at Ota.
Aldus (Jess): Oooo ok I could try friday then, but I either have to buy something for them to sign or buy something they have there
Aldus (Jess): Also it would obviously be cooler to meet them in mm cosplay but it's not like a requirement
Bill: You're going to the 11am signings.
Bill: I have *nothing* solid for saturday. We'll do a different time lol.
Aldus (Jess): Okay dokeeeey
Bill: https://www.pinterest.com/willow_lark/portraiture/couple-poses/ We putting some of those to work for Renora at least, if not Kidnapping Kinks.
Elfriede (Tom): the "SNEAKY PETE"
Bill: The focus for Renora is definitely spicy. We had the weapons at Zenkai, and original one was katsu ~~and sucked by default~~, but now it's time to let everyone know dis ship still sailing. 🌶
Bill: And as we all know, Kidnapping Kinks is Jess living out a husbando fantasy, sooooo... 😈
Afina (Georgia🍀): I THOUGHT YOU MEANT SPICY LIKE WINK WINK SPICY OOOOH
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): but then you said weaponsss
Bill: I'm not sure what your brain is getting up to.
Bill: Throwback to the original Otakon JNPR references page, I still love this one.
Aldus (Jess): why he scared?
Aldus (Jess): oh we getting double spicy? NICU
Bill: Embarrassed, and double spicy what?
Aldus (Jess): spicy with renora, spicy with unkownXmc
Aldus (Jess): double spicy

Eliran (Halim): Yeah
Bill: 1pm Saturday.
Bill: Need to confirm Meg and Lissy and that’s the requests side. Georgia/Jess&Tom have plenty of float room. I know there’s a henceforward group with Dan, though Zeikani dropped HF!Yang. If I see Dan I might try and get to shoot that because henceforward is baller.

Aldus (Jess): oh stop
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hunter got our Anext badges idkkkk
Afina (Georgia🍀): He just really wants me to plan a Woodbridge RWBY meet up tbh lol
Bill: I’m *Teasing*.
Eliran (Halim): he what
Bill: I remember him yes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hunter gave us our Anext badges early so we didn't have to sit in line
Eliran (Halim): ooohhh
Afina (Georgia🍀): He a good
Bill: I don’t have the paperwork anymore for d&b but if you decide to look into it I’ll see if I can find it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean it sounds like one of the best options
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's indoors, there's stuff to do
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's just the crowd that would have to be fought
Bill: Mm, it’s unlikely there’d be enough interest to book the place outright.
Bill: Granted we went on winter break didn’t we?
Bill: If it’s winter, and not the school break, should help the crowd.
Afina (Georgia🍀): True cause then POS kids can't get in
Bill: You’re 20, what POS kids lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean the general public kids
Bill: Mm.
Bill: The portal is a fucking scam.
Bill: The hotel doesn’t want to honor the parking. I chewed out the Otakon people for false advertising, they’re going to talk to the hotel and get back to me. Also the price the portal displays doesn’t include taxes, they only include those afterwards.
Bill: Fuck Otakon’s booking, seriously.
Bill: But, we can stow our bags if we get there early. 🙄
Bill: But the distance is important, given the white pride rally down where that Marriott deal I got through chase is.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Eugh forgot about that
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's messy shit
Bill: It’s only Sunday I believe.
Bill: But yeah. Imma white Mom these sons of bitches.
Bill: Cause I was lied to *twice*.
Aldus (Jess): shit so now parkings not included?
Bill: The hotel says it isn’t. Otakon booming company says it is.
Elfriede (Tom): They better give you that shit for free
Afina (Georgia🍀): Use them RECEIPTS BILLIAM
Afina (Georgia🍀): YOU KICK THEIR BUTTS
Elfriede (Tom): The booking company ofc, not the hotel
Bill: Booking company is escalating the issue.
Elfriede (Tom): GOOD
Bill: And if we have to pay, I’m going to see about meeting the Otakon chair while we’re there.
Bill: We have comp'd parking again. 😏
Bill: Though I'm going to call the hotel in a bit to confirm that for sure.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah better off
Elfriede (Tom): Nicu
Bill: is confirmed.
Aldus (Jess): thank god
Bill: _bows_
