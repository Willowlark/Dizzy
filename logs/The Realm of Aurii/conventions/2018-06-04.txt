Bill: Pretty sure there's a group shoot.
Afina (Georgia🍀): for Yona? eh whatever
Afina (Georgia🍀): im not gonna stress myself cause then ill rush it and hate it and wanna remake it
Bill: No, for bug. I think pushing it is an good idea.
Bill: 1pm Friday.
Bill: Thought it was at 3, that's Star.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 1 pm friday is ladybug? sweet
Afina (Georgia🍀): does that change our time to shoot then ~~maybe i can borrow a chat noir~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): hal is gonna throw together adrien too, cause he has the wig and clothes, just needs to paint stripes on a black shirt
Bill: But he won't be at the con till 4?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ya so we could match for like... 2 hours before formal
Bill: unless you end up changing for the formal early so we have time to actually take photos...?
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> have 1pm, if they cool with it they can take 2pm slot instead and we can do the bug shoot.
Afina (Georgia🍀): hmmm good point
Afina (Georgia🍀): when IS the formal did we get a time yet
Bill: no idea.
Bill: Haven't seen the schedule.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 7 pm

Bill: prooooobably?
Aldus (Jess): Doesn't matter tonmeeee

Bill: Hal won't be there.
Bill: Ezreal is coming in time right <@!288513265661902858> ?
Eliran (Halim): /shrug
Eliran (Halim): I know the wig is here
Bill: ,...
Bill: Is it *expected* to be here?
Aldus (Jess): Of you email them they should be able to tell you
Eliran (Halim): I'll double check the tracking tonight
Bill: There are other people involved in this shoot, Ashley and Dan, we need to keep them in the loop if we need to push the time back for you.
Eliran (Halim): Its through USPS 
I'm out atm  but when I get home I'll check 0ackage tracking
Bill: Please, thanks Hal.
Bill: The delivery window might be a good estimate as well.
Eliran (Halim): I gave up on that
Eliran (Halim): Delivery window suggested it'd be here last week latest
Bill: Ah, fuck them then.
Bill: Gotcha.
Eliran (Halim): yeahhhh it probably won't be here in time
Bill: Wait, did you look already?
Eliran (Halim): i was just picking up pizza like 5 minutes from my houseish I spent the extra 40 dollars for shipping
Aldus (Jess): Where is it? Like it's allready been shipped? Or they haven't shipped it yet?
Eliran (Halim): I think its still at the first checkpoint enroute from china
Eliran (Halim): the wording is odd but thats what it means
Eliran (Halim): so it probably won't get here until a week after anext knowing my luck
Aldus (Jess): Ugh 😭
Bill: *Shit*.
Eliran (Halim): i wish I paid the extra money but like fuck 
Between ezreal and Hak I already spent like 300 dollars for costumes wigs and shipping
Aldus (Jess): Was Hak from the same place? When was e supposed to arrive?
Eliran (Halim): yeah he was, he hasn't started shipping yet (probably cause custom order) 
But once he does he's supposed to arrive in 2/3 days
Eliran (Halim): I didn't realize custom ordering it would mean I'd have to wait an extra month for something to ship
Eliran (Halim): cause thats the only explanation i can think off
Aldus (Jess): Ez cosplay? Or miccostumes? Or another site?
Eliran (Halim): skycostume
Eliran (Halim): they're usually p reliable from what I've heard
Eliran (Halim): I don't trust ezcosplay
Aldus (Jess): Ohhh I never heard of them. Tom's Ren and my Nora shoes are from EZ our 2b 9s and star gaurdians are from miccostumes
Eliran (Halim): sky seemed to have the most accurate for the best price but rip i guess
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: Ez worked for the AB jacket.
Aldus (Jess): Prayer circle for Hal's cosplays
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🙏 🙏 🙏
Bill: ...Tankcon?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 🙏
