Bill: I'm getting a gopro by next CCE. Waterproof, small, can handle the 'hanging out but still a photographer' section of the con.
Bill: Saw Jake's and I was like 'genius'.
Elfriede (Tom): Where'd he wear his
Bill: he just held it.
Bill: You can use it as a camera.
Bill: like?
Bill: Going to be cheaper than water/humidity proof enclosures for a dslr, can tell you that much.
Bill: Will CCE's dates finalized I'm going to have to call Kalahari again to see if I can snek in early.
Elfriede (Tom): Oh I missed this entire chat yesterday
Elfriede (Tom): Huh
Elfriede (Tom): Marisa can cuddle with Jess, it'll be fine. I'll just take my half of the bed <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): (jk Jess can't sleep if she's cuddling)
Bill: Wut?
