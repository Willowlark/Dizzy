Bill: who wants to go on a cruise with camerasssss
Bill: for like, 175 bucks.
Bill: <@!288513265661902858> So I can't get the Sheraton to remove the charge for your car unless I have a receipt showing you paid elsewhere. If you have that, I'd appreciate it.
Nokri (Marisa): haha
ha

Bill: <@!301927856240459777> I'm sure you know what up
Eliran (Halim): Bill
Eliran (Halim): They cant have charged for my car
Eliran (Halim): If they're charging a third car it's completely unrelated 
Because I never talked to Sheraton, parked with Sheraton or anything
Eliran (Halim): Saying they charged for my car is like saying they charged for Marisas car
Eliran (Halim): I also dont have the tickets, the machine takes them when you leave
Bill: I know the parking charges are in excess, but unless I show that you parked elsewhere via some kind of record that you paid a different parking lot for friday and saturday night, they can't remove the charges.
Eliran (Halim): Ok but 
Why do you need to show that somebody who isn't in the room
Didnt park with the room
Bill: because I could also say we had one car. There's a level of trust involved with this Hal. They are justified to not want to remove charges because I said they're wrong, because I have everything to gain.
Bill: If you don't have a record, that's fine. It's twenty bucks or so.
Bill: I'm just asking in case.
Eliran (Halim): I dont have a record the machine at the convention center takes the ticket
Bill: Then that's that. (Though it won't matter in this scenario, that IS the hotel parking lot.)
Eliran (Halim): It isn't 
They're separate
Eliran (Halim): They have different lots with different machines
Bill: I'm only saying hotel parking is down there as well.
Bill: The level of effort required to get the charges removed at this point isn't worth the money back, they already removed the phantom car we didn't have and the thursday night stay from 'your' car.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ya know I'm a "plan in advance person"
Afina (Georgia🍀): But is it bad I have 0 interest in planning Katsu right now as far as groups go?
Bill: it's because it's Katsu.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like cheerleader RWBY sounds fun but I don't wanna commit like that
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause... it's stupid busy? 😜
Bill: pretty much. Both of us have sour points for Katsu.
Bill: bet you also would rather be organizing the group too.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe a little bit
Afina (Georgia🍀): I also have little interest in cheerleader RWBY
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not super crazy about all mojojojs designs
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean I'm not doing bunny Pyrrha for RTX
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or this cheerleader one for Katsu
Afina (Georgia🍀): Swimsuits I would do but that's also pretty generic
Bill: yeah.
Bill: Only other one I can think of his china dress.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I also had spitballed my own line up for Katsu and it only devotes half a day to RWBY
Afina (Georgia🍀): I might wanna do Fallout or Borderlands or League or Nier
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~wow I really play more video games than watch anime huh~~
Bill: yup.
Bill: do keep in mind volume 6 is going to come out and we're all probably going to hype the hell out rwby again.
Bill: and by we I mean mostly me, becaust stockholm syndrome.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I imagine my Katsu is like half a Friday RWBY (cause the turn out at RWBY shoots is better that day anyways), half a day something else, half a day league, half a day something else, and maybe persona on Sunday
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's what I've been kicking around (and I've only thought of it because I need to plan expenses)
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think Fallout hype will be up again so I may do that
Afina (Georgia🍀): But also I still have yet to play Nier 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): So yeah idk Katsu is too far away for me to commit and I feel weird cause a lot of others are doing it lol
Bill: Cheer outfits are probably too simple for you anyway.
Bill: You like things with complexity, since you enjoy the process of making them, or at least with complicated components like Lux staff.
Aldus (Jess): i feel like its early to commit too
Aldus (Jess): i feel like the group will fall apart but that time
Bill: The only mojojoj that's complicated sounds like china dresses.
Bill: *truth*.
Aldus (Jess): i mean cheer Nora is cute and i like that her design is different than the beacon ones but yea idk wanna commit to that
Bill: Dups are allowed, so no need to. You can probably slide in late if you want to join up.
Aldus (Jess): true, honesty i cheer outfit looks easy af even for me
Bill: yeet.
