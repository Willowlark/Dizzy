Ienzo (john g): im going to otakon
Nokri (Marisa): ~~get us the mystic mess autographs~~
Ienzo (john g): idk what mystic mess is.... im going for distant worlds and p5 makotos voice actress
Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/10/15/con-shortlist.html
Bill: 
Bill: oh what the fuck now.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I WAS ABOUT TO POST THAT HERE
Aldus (Jess): oof
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I JUST GOT THIS
Aldus (Jess): careful how you act?
Bill: Someone's trying to rope you back in.
Bill: Probably because Snow said something.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: *sonofabitch*
Aldus (Jess): omggggg
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: ah yes, the fucking cosplay justice league out to save the day from bullying by doing more of it.
Bill: Some asshats with a friend with a bunch of followers think they rule the world because of it, thinking they can judge someone they don't even know via social fucking media.
Aldus (Jess): even if you try to stay nuetral and take no sides people still have an issue what BS
Bill: There's no such thing as neutral, it's *us or them*. It's fucking highschool mean girls bullshit.
Bill: I'm legitimately scared for you Georgia. You put way too much stock into your follower count for self esteem purposes, and you love cons for the community. This shitstorm can damage both of those things.
Bill: and even if I had a fix, because we're apparently airing out people's shit *across the entire east coast*, I can't do a damn thing.
Aldus (Jess): id say just keep neutral being the way you are. insist on being neutral and no comment
Aldus (Jess): honestly i still feel there isnt even enough hard evidence to choose a side if youw anted too
Bill: That worked before because they were looking for support.
Bill: They can spin any bullshit they want if they're trying to force her to one side or the other.
Bill: and you *actually* don't know anything about this crap, and that's in a sense another problem. They can make shit up all they want and you can't refute it. Again, wasn't a problem before, but has become so now that *we're on a fucking witchhunt.*
Bill: Nor can you defuse things with knowledge you have.
Bill: You need understanding of a situation to figure out the best way to defuse people. Whose doing the rallying, what they're looking for, what placates them.
Aldus (Jess): theres literally nothing you can do besides claim ignorance (which isnt a lie) and refuse to get involved
Bill: and that *pisses me off*.
Aldus (Jess): thats drama for you
Aldus (Jess): even when you do everything to stay out of it someone pulls you in
Afina (Georgia🍀): Thankfully Nathaniel is on my "neutral" side
Bill: if it was local drama, I can *do* something. I was able to curb Ethan right.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hes saying exactly what I would want to say which is "I'm against bullying in any form, but I'm not informed enough on the situation so I'm neutral"
Bill: but this is in FUCKING VIRGINIA, which has nothing to do with us.
Bill: He's a good egg.
Bill: I can't even say pull out of RTX like I did before; that can be taken as running away due to guilty.
Bill: If I hadn't already punched a tree today I'd punch another.
Aldus (Jess): pulling out of rtx was never going to happen anyway
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think I'll be alright
Afina (Georgia🍀): My stance can't really be argued for now
Bill: Shouldn't have to, but Snow shot it in the foot.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Well no ones gonna say "get involved without knowing anything" cause that's unfair
Afina (Georgia🍀): So for now I'm safe
Aldus (Jess): just keep doing you. idk what he means by watch the way you act
Bill: It means the cosplay justice league is off trying to judge Georgia based on her social media.
Afina (Georgia🍀): So: don't post RWBY from zenkaikon
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just to be safe
Bill: Decent idea.
Aldus (Jess): yea basically
Aldus (Jess): GUESS YOULL JUST HAVE TO POST JNPR
Aldus (Jess): JNPR is safe, you can trust us ❤
Bill: Not that the asshole brigade deserves to dictate your content.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no we have to take more JNPR pics 💛💖❤️💚
Afina (Georgia🍀): What a tragedy
Bill: maybe I'll punch a tree anyway.
Aldus (Jess): but that hurts
Afina (Georgia🍀): Then you'll hurt your CAMERA HANDS
Bill: yeah well this shit's pissing me off on two aspects, I don't even care.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: No shit it's Jake.
Bill: Bless nathenial.
Bill: He lacks a kofi.
Bill: He's apparently disappointed Snow didn't off herself.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 😱 😱 😱 😱
Aldus (Jess): right?!
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: do not black out.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Aldus (Jess): NO DRAMA ZONE UGH
Afina (Georgia🍀): I figured that much out
Afina (Georgia🍀): Black out looks guilty
Afina (Georgia🍀): Posting certain things looks guilty
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Just keep being you and the situation will dissolve
Bill: That's where I'm at too.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Cuz even if someone asks you something at a convention, you'll just be like, I know nothing about that really
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And that's that
Aldus (Jess): i dont understand why this is all resurfacing again? did snow do something else? or is morning mist and crew bring it all back up? we dont even know enough to form an opinion
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Exactly
Aldus (Jess): THANK GOD she is in denver and not going comming this weekend
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: So we're not involved
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah lmao
Aldus (Jess): cuz that would damn us all
Aldus (Jess): i invited her b4 all this
Bill: That's why.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She's not even listed on the invite list anymore
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Prob cuz of the account being down
Bill: She's off to another con, not two weeks after a suicide attempt.
Aldus (Jess): cuz she deleted her fb
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeeet
Aldus (Jess): oooo thats why its resurfacing?
Bill: logic would ditate.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But seriously try not to let it get to you much, just keep being you, everything will work out
Bill: He's right.
Bill: That said, that may bring flak on you. You'll have to harden your heart and keep being the girl we know and love.
Bill: How anyone could possibly find you to be a bully like Snow and Mist, I don't know. But it's a risk.
Bill: If it comes to that, we need all the facts. Can't mount a defense without them. Knowledge is power and all that.
Aldus (Jess): yea but theres no way to garentee those are the facts
Bill: Fair, I more mean knowing everyone's side of the story.
Aldus (Jess): ooo ok
Afina (Georgia🍀): I could post a blanket "bully is wrong" thing?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk inaction here feels wrong, but so does taking action
Aldus (Jess): yea i really dont know hun, my instinct is stay quite but....
Aldus (Jess): ~~thats always my answer~~
Bill: Instagram people put value on stories, I see where Nathaniel is coming from.
Aldus (Jess): stories are for memes, and food pics f dat lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): A blanket story that bullying is wrong would be good cause it shows I'm not ignoring the situation
Afina (Georgia🍀): But doesn't implicate me on either side
Bill: *what situtation*
Bill: Literally nothing knew has happened but Jake and Casey going on a fucking *witchhunt*.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The situation that either snow or mist are forcing to bring up again lmaoooooo
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: But then they'll question why you were posting it "randomly" in the first place.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean it's a known fact that there's drama going on
Bill: That you aren't truly privvy to.
Afina (Georgia🍀): There's a running assumption that I AM though
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which is why ignoring it looks bad
Bill: and you *don't* want to encourage that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): They're gonna assume it anyways though
Bill: You can't play ball without knowing the facts. Staying neutral is important for your moral quality of life. (Spitting on Mist AND Snow, well)
Aldus (Jess): why do they both have weather names 🤔
Bill: Cause they're both horrible human beings.
Aldus (Jess): change your name to sunnywezrez cuz you gonna clear up all dis bad weather
Bill: WHy do you need a fucking PR team for a instagram accoutn.
Afina (Georgia🍀): SUNNYREZ
Afina (Georgia🍀): IT ME
Aldus (Jess): "hello yes? no im sorry wezrez isnt making statement on this right now"
Aldus (Jess): "i can take a message and express your concerns to her"
Bill: "also watch out for the gum you accidentially just sat in"
Bill: If you want to get a little personal, high school graduations are coming up. You say 'to all the kids who were bullied in HS, I was too. Then I entered the cosplay community, and found out how wonderful a place it is. bullying is wrong, look forward to your futures'.
Bill: Which still feels fake as hell to me, but I'm a pessamist.
Bill: It's not topical, it shows your stance, and seems a little more coincidental.
Afina (Georgia🍀): that's a good idea
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's very generic
Bill: I'm not a PR guy though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~I wasn't bullied in high school I was just an outcast it's different but that's ok~~
Bill: phrase it so you aren't lying then. Never want to get caught in a lie.
Bill: If we had the *facts*, I lean towards stating 'I am not involved, I do not want to be involved, I do not know mist or snow well enough to make judgements, I do not make judgements off social media and hearsay, and I do not participate in witchhunts.'.
Bill: But to play ball you need to be confident you can back your stance.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Plus that offends everyone involved
Afina (Georgia🍀): As much as Nathaniel doesn't think so, I do sorta have a reputation?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not in the cosplay community to make enemies
Afina (Georgia🍀): I almost ALMOST wanna ask someone FOR the details but that's a bad move
Bill: you have a brand reputation, yes.
Bill: I know the feeling. But Tom was right, keeping doing you and it may blow over.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): ALSO I'm mad at Snow cause it was HER who dragged me into this by namedropping
Bill: fuck Snow.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oh yeah same
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And you only saw a piece of it too
Bill: I'm offending everyone because fuck em all. They're all terrible people to get bystanders involved like this.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: We're at super disliking her and ignoring her existence
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like I definitively know Snow dragged me into this
Afina (Georgia🍀): That is a FACT
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I can stand by that and be mad at that
Afina (Georgia🍀): If she hadn't name dropped me in an attempt to be associated with nice people, I wouldn't be in this mess
Bill: Yet we'll shit on our BNE relationship if we do go against Snow.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mostly Jaime and Heather tho it sounds like
Afina (Georgia🍀): A lot of people are playing neutral
Bill: Rebecca too.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ye
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Leanna and Snow.... ehhhh
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah Rebecca seems a little less committed than those two
Bill: Mark will probably be bothered by it. Mostly because suicide is serious and he's a dad.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): But also Snow dragging bystanders in isn't, like, okay either??
Bill: I don't want to shit on BNE personally, but I'm definitely done with Snow.
Bill: Yup.
Bill: All of them. Shit.
Bill: Casey, Jake, Snow, Mist.
Bill: keep your drama in fucking virginia.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's one of those situations where people are trying to create drama from nothing. And like... I'm so turned off tonthise situations even if I'm involved. My bother and his wife were the same way.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Regaurdless it'll blow over.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It'll stay blown over as long as snow or mist dont do something dumb like reopen it repeatedly. Which if they do... I'll do what I have to to cut them out of my life.
Bill: I'd do it now, if I could.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: (I'm not the one in the situation so it's all theoretical)
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah it's just messy
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll see what info Nathaniel gets from today
Bill: Tom's right. wait for it to blow over, we'll react accordingly as things evolve, and just be you. fuck their opinions.
Afina (Georgia🍀): He seems to be on Team Neutral at least cries
Bill: I just want to call out jake on trying to witch hunt,.
Bill: I can't, both because it would reflect on you Georgia as well as I have no credablity in this field.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I thought he was such a nice person too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Isn't he like 30 also you'd think he's past this kinda stuff
Bill: High road.
Bill: That's the strategy now.
Bill: Maybe mister hero can learn from you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Is it worth asking Hunter about what contexts I'm being brought up in?
Afina (Georgia🍀): He's in the Casey camp but he's always had a soft spot for me as a fellow Woodbridge-area RWBY
Aldus (Jess): no one ever past it
Aldus (Jess): i know 60 yearolds who start drama
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Plus Jake prob is a nice guy who thinks he's doing the right thing
Aldus (Jess): yup
Bill: Do not Georgia.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Plus he didn't say anything directly again her
Bill: Hold off, see what happens, make sure Natheniel knows to keep you in the loop.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Seriously ignore it, it's the best thing to do,don't get involved for the want to know what's being said about you
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's not worth knowing
Bill: 👆
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I know you really wanna know but
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: If people are saying anything it has no backing and they know that, so the rumors will die when people meet and talk to you.
Bill: Consider it a tactical maneuver to not show interest.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nad that's that
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof fuck this situation
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Bill: And the internet as whole doesn't matter, don't forget that. You have your friends, your boyfriend, and your family.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeaaaaah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Dang Snow getting me involved
Bill: And this is why BNE isn't close friends.
Bill: You're getting a big damn hug tomorrow, so you know.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 💕
Afina (Georgia🍀): Alright time to find some JNPR to post today
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh wait I posTED IT ALL cries
Afina (Georgia🍀): I have other non Snow pics tho it's okay
Afina (Georgia🍀): There's thankfully a lot of un-involved people I have pics with
Aldus (Jess): ~~post selfies of my and you~~ jk dont do that
Bill: ditto tho. We all post selfies with Georgia.
Aldus (Jess): doenst that just get more people involved?
Bill: ~~Not for that, I just want to post selfies with my buddy~~
Aldus (Jess): mmhmm sure XD
Bill: why would I want to get you involved <@&455787357426417674> ?
Aldus (Jess): #teamwezrez
Aldus (Jess): STAHHPP 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lmaoo
Bill: * #teamwiserice
Bill: This too shall pass.
Afina (Georgia🍀): *throws rice at people* DONT BE DRAMA
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): now we are talking
Bill: 10/10 ign.
Bill: Better than Fallout 76.
Aldus (Jess): ~~thats not hard to do though~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): *throws rice* begone THOT
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ugh I wanted to do a "RTX round up" for all the events at RTX so people know
Afina (Georgia🍀): But NOW that seems like I'm TAKING sIdES
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: I'm not actually sure how with that one.
Bill: But write RTX off as a vacation with Hal and Hal alone.
Aldus (Jess): arent you running event though?
Bill: Everywhere else will be a minefield.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I'm running the RWBY group shoots
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which is why I'm in this mess
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause snow was like YOU CANT GET ME, GEORGIAS MY FRIEND
Afina (Georgia🍀): and they're like georgia...... we know that name.......
Aldus (Jess): 😦
Afina (Georgia🍀): _if Snow had kept their stupid mouth shut_
Aldus (Jess): yea so you cant really avoid the events youve already taken on
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): I wonder what Mist or Snow is doing to re-open the wounds on this
Afina (Georgia🍀): Frankly if I believe anything, it's that Snow was the liar, and dragged me into this mess
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause she name dropped me all the way back at Katsu time
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then did it AGAIN now
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I got lucky last time that David caught it and fixed it, and Nathaniel caught it this time and is trying to help fix it
Afina (Georgia🍀): But this can't keep happening
Bill: indeed. I wouldn't recommend burning a bridge until you have information though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm neutral
Afina (Georgia🍀): But personally I would say that I lean away from Snow
Bill: We all do.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Not necessarily towards the Mist side but frankly Snow has caused way more trouble than she's worth
Bill: I'd stay third party, "against" both.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like Casey's group would be placated with knowing I'm not on snows side
Afina (Georgia🍀): But
Afina (Georgia🍀): Neutrality for now
Bill: Stay neutral.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Until it blows over or I get some information or what
Eliran (Halim): Christ this is a mess
Bill: However, if David has screen caps of Snow talking shit about you too, that's valuable.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah good point
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll go see if I can find those
Afina (Georgia🍀): At least for receipts
Afina (Georgia🍀): Boom got da receipts screenshotted
Bill: what do you mean by dat tho?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just screenshotting proof that snow caused beef earlier in the year
Bill: Directly? Or David telling you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): David telling me
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean that's all I have
Bill: Only thing better would be if Mist sent David screen shots.
Bill: But you'd have to ask.
Afina (Georgia🍀): She didn't nah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Bill: And David would go in guns blazing for you, but that's not helpful right now.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just good to gather info for now
Afina (Georgia🍀): To have it if I need it
Bill: exactly.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: **oof everything points to snow being the villian**
Bill: ~~we knew that though~~
Bill: ~~we were just willing to let by gones be by gones unlike some asshats~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <@351471675843411978> I JUST REALIZEDD SNOW REMINDS ME OF MARY ABORT ABORT
Aldus (Jess): Welp she didn't share a name with the most evil substance know to man
Aldus (Jess): YEP
Bill: That's *good news* though.
Bill: *Maybe she'll run off to fuck all mid west with someone and not come back for 5 years*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: T~~oo bad Mary wasn't gay too. Then she wouldn't have dated my brother~~
Bill: *PERFECT I ship it*
Aldus (Jess): You mean married your brother
Afina (Georgia🍀): I screenshotted the DMs with angryjigglypuff though
Bill: dated, married, same thing. Right Tom and-his-girlfriend-Jess.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Though she just posted this
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: *Oh for fucks sake*
Aldus (Jess): Ommgggg are you fucking kidding me
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Who's that
Aldus (Jess): Member of the mist defense squad
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's unrelated anyways cuz both are claiming they were bullied
Aldus (Jess): Passive aggressive bullshit
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And we don't have facts so
Aldus (Jess): Yup exactly know the truth
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which explains why Nathaniel said this
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Pffft
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ignore it all <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh huh
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ya know that means David was involved in the drama with Snow and Mist
Bill: What happened to the "Suicide is serious, everything is in the past, I'm so sad" bullshit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): So in the end David took mists side for a reason
Afina (Georgia🍀): Interesting to note 👀
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooooh mangoloo got added to nathaniels RTX photoshoot planning discord
Afina (Georgia🍀): That means they must be talking now
Bill: Assuming Jigglypuff is backing the wtich hunt, they want you to decry Mist from the photoshoot so 'you're not welcome in the community anymore' is a real threat.
Afina (Georgia🍀): You mean Snow? And yeah maybe..
Bill: yeah, SNow.
Eliran (Halim): Duck that 
They said they'd be willing to make amends and help her get over herself 
, you can't say that while also trying to enforce a community shut out 
Plus like 
Outbullying somebody doesn't solve anything, if anything it proves snows point
Aldus (Jess): yea you cant fight fire with fire and expect by standers to support you
Bill: They're~all~ass~holes~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeeeeeeeet
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean yeah they're hypocrites
Aldus (Jess): yea
Afina (Georgia🍀): But (this may sound selfish) they're not personally harming me
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm more mad that Snow has tried to drag me into business that isn't mine
Afina (Georgia🍀): T W I C E
Bill: You don't have the facts. It's hard to care based on thirty angry people's words.
Bill: No one is rational or logical, the actual truth doesn't matter as long as someone gets hurt.
Bill: Look, Listen, and Think for yourself.
Bill: Never make a public declaration against someone based on one person's opinion.
Bill: The passive aggressive shit is getting old too.
Bill: If they want you to do something, fucking say it.
Bill: You're all in Nathaniels discord together. They know how to reach you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Thankfully nathaniel and hal are in that discord yeah
Bill: instagram right now.
