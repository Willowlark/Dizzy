Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): CCE packing more like "do I only wear red, black, and white?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): I still have to finish Yona after I fucked up on the jacket the other day but after that, I should be set
Afina (Georgia🍀): <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> JNPR tattoos?? What's da plan boissss
Elfriede (Tom): Hmm 🤔 unsure
Nokri (Marisa): YONA
Aldus (Jess): I'll order tattoo paper tomorrow since I'm out
Afina (Georgia🍀): Can't wait for ~~JNPR tramp stamps~~ matching tattoos ahhhhh
Nokri (Marisa): Has the Otakon room been booked?
Nokri (Marisa): Reportedly there were a lot of technical issues but the marquis sold out before 12:05. Courtney managed to nab a room
Elfriede (Tom): I don't believe it has
Bill: I may have forgot about that.
Bill: Room blocks usually don't open till 8 or 9 tho.
Nokri (Marisa): i saw someone claim they got one 45 minutes before the roomblock opened by calling
Bill: that does happen.
Bill: I usually try to do that.
Bill: oh well fuck us.
Nokri (Marisa): they still have some within walking distance
Bill: They upped the opening to yesterday at noon.
Bill: That's why people have rooms already.
Bill: It was announced for today.
Nokri (Marisa): ye, they announced a few ago it was moved 🙀
Nokri (Marisa): cambria suites is the closest they have that still has openings
Nokri (Marisa): rip nevermind it's a waitlist
Nokri (Marisa): the renaissance across the street has one-bed rooms open. it'll be like bravely default.
Nokri (Marisa): otakon has a lot of communications issues
Bill: yeah.
Bill: Booked two suites in the embassy suites, king, but judging by Jake's room and the occupancy they all have sofa beds + room for air mattresses.
Bill: 217 a night isn't bad at all, and it is close.
Bill: Now I'll try and get a hold of the marriott marquis/renaissance.
Nokri (Marisa): "hewwo mawiatt? pwease do u hawv rwooms" say that
Bill: Depending on my patience for the automated answering machines.
Bill: (This is why I ask everyone else to watch social media for room stuff as well, I am not infallible and can miss things)
Bill: *cough*
Nokri (Marisa): i didn't realize until courtney posted and i checked their social media i'm sowwy 😭
Aldus (Jess): I don't think I follow otakon 😥 I follow AnimeNEXT, zenkai, CCE, animenyc and katsu but I think I forgot ota
Bill: Don't have to apologize Mawisa.
Bill: Ye, I muted Otakon notifications cause they wouldn't shut up during the event. I never turned them back on.
Aldus (Jess): That's kinda BS that they moved it up though
Nokri (Marisa): otakon can't even communicate properly during the con. it's a logistical nightmare.
Bill: mmmmhm.
Bill: Marquis is out, likely so is Renaissance. The latter has double rooms, but the cost is double the embassy suites.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof
Afina (Georgia🍀): Stupid Otakon
Afina (Georgia🍀): _they emailed yesterday asking about reviews, they gonna get one_
Bill: I
Bill: I'm not really torn up with Otakon; everything is so close together it's not the end of the world.
Bill: Embassy it is. Every room has a pullout sofabed.
Bill: And will have room for at least one air mattress.
Bill: Otakon booked...!
Nokri (Marisa): i wonder if there's a statistic for how many people sleep on the balcony at katsu
Nokri (Marisa): "a well functioning system" for otakon? 😂
Bill: It actually let's you book, so better than Katsu.
Bill: Still, I'd rather work with the hotel directly.
Nokri (Marisa): "wow nice hotel concierge cosplay. totally realistic. very in-character too."
Nokri (Marisa): NO ONE TOLD ME THIS YEAR'S OTAKON AMV WINNER WAS SUCH A GEM
Nokri (Marisa): this is so good
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5J8XPuCnMA
Nokri (Marisa): everyone who just woke up is realizing they've been bamboozled by otakon owo
Aldus (Jess): Good morning otakon fucked you over
Afina (Georgia🍀): Another day, another con ganKING US
