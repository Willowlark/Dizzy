Afina (Georgia🍀): /stomps on the ground
Aldus (Jess): the drive is kinda slow cuz old mine road is kinda pot holly but there are multiple locations along it
Aldus (Jess): https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sparta+Township,+New+Jersey+07871/Walpack+Center,+Walpack+Township,+NJ+07826/@41.1831211,-74.8631238,12.75z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c36d6a5d585495:0x9a86e6858aabbafb!2m2!1d-74.6363588!2d41.0334562!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c361562f87c9e9:0x677e8a5e3f5bb041!2m2!1d-74.8801693!2d41.1589843
Aldus (Jess): thats the trip from sparta to walpack center itself
Aldus (Jess): but id recommend starting on one end of old mine rd and doing the whole thing  ~~too bad fathers day is sunday it would be a perfect time to do it actually~~
Bill: ~~I just thought of that~~
Bill: where's old mine rd?
Aldus (Jess): rough idea: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Montague+Grange,+280+River+Rd,+Montague+Township,+NJ+07827/Old+Mine+Rd,+Hardwick,+NJ/@41.1661784,-75.0544957,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c35b58a07c0aab:0xdb796baf885869e8!2m2!1d-74.796768!2d41.300913!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c4839364d28425:0x2a22785eefae83f0!2m2!1d-75.0380971!2d41.03092

Aldus (Jess): there are some good one literally a mile from my parents house since they live right outside of the gov. land
Aldus (Jess): great places for fallout shoots as alot of the houses were built in the 1700s so they have the same style as the boston houses

Aldus (Jess): whats the third?
Aldus (Jess): renora, fallout and?

Aldus (Jess): id be weary cuz of litering
Bill: and squatting.
Bill: it's one idea, just trying to work on the not 'pretty' shoot ideas.
Bill: Princeton is fucking amazing, but looks too put together for some shoots.
Aldus (Jess): childs park is another good waterfall location
