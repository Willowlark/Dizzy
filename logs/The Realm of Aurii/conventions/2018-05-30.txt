Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: Whoever that is unfollow them.
Bill: 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Afina (Georgia🍀): They a girl at least lol
Bill: That does help drastically.
Bill: Panelist had it right, guys do not choose to get into boudoir, they get asked to.
Afina (Georgia🍀): What ya mean
Bill: She basically said if you’re a guy trying to get into boudoir photography, you’re going to be seen as creepy. Just because you’re a guy and boudoir is predominantly women.
Bill: It’s just fact, a guy volunteering to see a woman in her underwear, and photograph it? It’s inherently a bit uncomfortable. Even with a woman photographer there’s some grade A awkward going on.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Very true ye
Bill: Then there’s always what if the model accuses you of something, innocent or not? Some photographers may be inappropriate but you sure as hell don’t want a false review saying you were if the model wants to spite you. You’ll be effectively black balled. (Recommendation with that is always have a woman witness with you, as a third party observer. Also an assistant photography wise, win win.)
Bill: So the only way I figure a guy would get involved in boudoir is if a friend asked them to do it.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> you will have class Thursday for Next right?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee
Bill: When would you be able to get back, Day 0 Cosplay up?, and be ready for pick up?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lemme do the maths, are we cosplay Thursday?
Bill: I ain’t. Dave ain’t. Tom and Jess ain’t I think.
Bill: But there is badge pickup to show up in cos for.
Bill: Tho, Yurippe?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Might just throw on my vault suit with my regular clothes if only cause that's a very quick change
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hmmmm possible
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yurippe has bloo eyes so it would work
Bill: Well, that decision aside, timeframe?
Afina (Georgia🍀): to be back at my house and ready to go?
Afina (Georgia🍀): id ballpark it like ~5
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe 4:30
Bill: Mmhm Kay.
Bill: We’d leave 3 or 4ish, which isn’t much earlier than if I start early.
Bill: Well, just decide Day 0.
Bill: do we know when the dance is if the schedule is out?
Aldus (Jess): i havent looked at full schedule yet
Bill: <@!288513265661902858> you know for sure what your Next nights will be?
Eliran (Halim): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Eliran (Halim): as of right now I'm just hoping I can go without having to pull multi hour round trips to get to work and back home in time for work the next day
Bill: lets try this, when *will* you know?
Eliran (Halim): one would hope this friday afternoon
Eliran (Halim): but theres potential for me to not have a schedule till sunday
Bill: lets hope for friday then.
Bill: I need to figure out the split for everyone else.
Eliran (Halim): If you're looking into how you should include me in the split, 
you should go with  a payment assuming I'm not coming at all, 
and a payment assuming I make it for thursday friday nights
Bill: well ye, I need to know which to do so people can send it. 😛
Eliran (Halim): start with assuming I'm not coming, if I do come, I can just pay them my share divided among party members like with zenkai
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean we can just wait it's no hassle for us lol
Bill: John asked.
Bill: no worries, as soon as you know let me know Hal.
Bill: wow, Mangaloo went to Colossalcon today. IE, Day -1.
Afina (Georgia🍀): She's got a packed schedule
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lifestyles of the ~~rich and~~ cosplay famous
Bill: I figure she went to fuck around tbh.
Bill: Kalahari is great, 10/10 would go wednesday night too.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Her story is just so meme-y gosh
Bill: that's the public persona.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOF FRUSTRATING I get it but like

Bill: Same here.
