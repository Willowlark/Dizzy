Bill: I now have a backpack, the same I used for college, filled with four bottles of liquor, two flasks, and camera gear.
Bill: If I stuck my macbook in there, I'd be the perfect college student.
Aldus (Jess): Lmao 4 bottles? Whatchu got? Strawberry vodka, some type of bourbon I'm assuming
Bill: The vodka and grenadine for the strawberry sunrises, woodford reserve for flask bourbon and the bottle kurtis got for my birthday for sipping.
Bill: It worked out surprisingly well.
Bill: Using the backpack I mean.
Aldus (Jess): Nice, now you just need a really long straw and Yu can walk around drinking it from your back pack
Bill: naaah. That's what the flasks are for.
Bill: This is overkill, I actually expect to not like the strawberry sunrises, but it's for the heck of it.
Aldus (Jess): ~~ill just drink the vodka~~
Bill: welcome to.
Bill: CCE is best vacation, cause friends and hot tubs and just...
Bill: ugh.
Bill: I *literally* cannot wait.
