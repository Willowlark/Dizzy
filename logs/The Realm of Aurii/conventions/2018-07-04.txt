Nokri (Marisa): Gotta go to anime expo again
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): That jade cover is really nice. I like how she gets the second cover all to herself since sheâ€™s not in the first one
Aldus (Jess): I heard there was a shooting threatened for anime expo ðŸ˜­
Nokri (Marisa): Anime expo has insanely strong security but anything could still happen ðŸ™€
Nokri (Marisa): Last time I went they closed half the convention center because someone lost their bag and it was treated as a bomb threat
Aldus (Jess): ðŸ˜®
