Nokri (Marisa): a photographer friend did a milk bath photoshoot? because apparently those are becoming common or something among some photographers? but it looks so uncomfortable. milk is so expensive.
Nokri (Marisa): CPAC is finally moving into an actual convention center
Nokri (Marisa): and it doesn't clash with zenkai this year. shocking.
Elfriede (Tom): Could prob do power that turns the water milky
Nokri (Marisa): "get in this milk powder water"
Nokri (Marisa): "for the aesthetic"
Nokri (Marisa): it'S LIKE THAT ONE PHOTOSHOOT
what was it. gummy bears?
Nokri (Marisa): YEAR the flippin' giant boxes of gummy bears at katsu
Nokri (Marisa): 170 pounds of them
Bill: Both of those happened this year.
Bill: I miss the campus tbh.
Nokri (Marisa): really? did you go?
Bill: Mhmm.
Nokri (Marisa): it rained on the campus a couple times i went, which made it a pain to go between buildings for events.
has it improved at all?
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Nooo it's worse
Nokri (Marisa): how that possible
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): They put ALL the events in one big atrium
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): So you could hear cosplay wrestling AND the performances AND whatever they had on the mini stage while in the Dealers room and video game room
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): It was basically one big airplane hanger that they sectioned off
Nokri (Marisa): oh nooooooooooooooo ohno oh no oh on
zenkai was like that for one year because we were desperate with nowhere else to go for a year, but they kept panels away from main events
that horrible
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Yeah so there were times when you couldn't hear the person speaking right next to you
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): It makes me not wanna go next year
Nokri (Marisa): someone didn't think things through. yikes. i wonder if they have anyone in charge or if the college students are free to do as they please?
like kotoricon is also a college con but dr. glenn controls it with an iron fist and everything has to be run by her, even though the club runs it together
