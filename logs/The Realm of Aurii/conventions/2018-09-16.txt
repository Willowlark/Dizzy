Bill: Booked two rooms at the Sheraton out of room block as a worst case. Surprised we could, last year Next booked out the whole con.
Bill: It's 331 a night, which is *gross*, but there was no deposit so I can cancel it when we get into the block.
Aldus (Jess): OOF yea hopefully the room block is better
Bill: However, the marriott SPG merger finished so I merged those accounts. Between the Next stays and last year's other cons, I'm silver elite now.
Bill: Time to see how to make use of THOSE perks.
Bill: *Give me a damn operator, you can't just dangle late checkout privileges and priority booking numbers in front of me and not explain them to me*
Bill: So if I get to Gold status, there's pretty much a guaranteed 2pm late check out.
Bill: That requires 15 more nights by January.
Bill: We can request it now that I'm silver tho.
Bill: Kalahri: Have confirmed the rate exists. The block is closed and the woman said they can't book regularly that far out yet.
Bill: Didn't get a hold of the rate info though.
Aldus (Jess): Yea I tried looking at rates online last night too
Aldus (Jess): I don't think you gonna a get 15 more by January tho ðŸ˜®
Bill: Nah. But, with the full 5 circuit (Katsu Zenkai Next Ota CCE) we'll hit 25 next year and go gold.
Bill: oh wait maybe not... It's hilton for Ota and CCE doesn't count.
Bill: Gold unlikely then.
