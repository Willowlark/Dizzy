Bill: So Dave is going to cosplay a rattley boi and show up at the Mangolooloo meetup Leanna style right?
Nokri (Marisa): this is it this sums up all of TGS day 2
Nokri (Marisa): also i discovered that the guys don't have to flip their skirts when they leave the changing rooms so guys can totally show off their underwear. lewd.

girls can wear bikinis or swimsuits, some were *super* minimal clothing as long as they have tights on underneath (there were a couple of shuten douji's) (because nude tights totally help with modesty or something). but if you have a skirt of any kind, you **must** have shorts on under it and they check at the changing room exit.
surprised this isn't a big cliche in yuri manga. maybe the mangaka just don't know about it.
Nokri (Marisa): there was also an FGO abigail in basically a nude bodysuit and a ton of girls just put tape on their chests but *heaven forbid a bra strap is visible u will be permabanned*
Dave: Slav goals
Bill: Tried to get Kalahari rooms again. Dates may be confirmed, but room rates aren’t.
