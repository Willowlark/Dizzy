Afina (Georgia🍀): Hmmm preferably RWBY but either or works
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: It's okay I guess ™

Nokri (Marisa): i spy a wezrez
Nokri (Marisa): looks like she has a long antenna because of the sword
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hmmm maybe the first
Bill: that's it, so...
Bill: go ahead.
Bill: ... huh.

Aldus (Jess): oh wow i barely remeber her
Bill: yeeee, naniiiii
Aldus (Jess): does she cosplay?
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: I tried to keep in touch with her decades ago, like freshman year of college. Didn't stick.
Aldus (Jess): but she follows you on insta?
Bill: mhmm.
Aldus (Jess): whats her handle?
Aldus (Jess): imma creep
Bill: foxtaildutchie.

Bill: yup. Thought she was cute way back when.
Aldus (Jess): she was in my shop too right? same year as you?
Bill: oh hell no, she was a freshman when I was a senior.
Bill: But was comm arts.
Aldus (Jess): ooooo ok so i never even went to school with her ops
Bill: true!
Bill: You'd have hated her too, at the time. 😛
Bill: She likes my stuff on occasion though.
Bill: I can't remember if it's the cosplay or actual photos.
Aldus (Jess): i met her at your house, she was nice, just super quite
Bill: ye.
Bill: Thought she was gay for awhile.
Aldus (Jess): she is
Bill: Hung out with all the anime club members that got super gay as soon as I left.
Bill: she is? I thought I saw a boyfriend at some point.
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aldus (Jess): maybe bi?
Bill: Or I wasn't paying too much attention.
Aldus (Jess): she has a rainbow symbol on her profile
Bill: Well, it IS pride month and half her friend group (unless it's changed drastically, but sussex county residents seem to stick together) is LGBT.
Aldus (Jess): " kinda gay | tbh I think I'm a guy, use Him/his for now I guess "
Aldus (Jess): from tumblr
Bill: Yeaaaah, that sounds like it.
Bill: That was most of the girls from the anime club, for whatever reason.
Aldus (Jess): ok that was a big ol hole of creeping i feel into
Bill: can we just low key enforce the name scheme in BNE tho? Admins can force nicknames.
Bill: ~~There's no way we can avoid bringing Snow back, I thought about it for a hot second~~
Eliran (Halim): What ya mean enforce the name scheme
Aldus (Jess): like Jess (whoozica)
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: Namely for new Erik and and Chris.
Bill: I doubt they'll care.
Bill: I just want BNE to stay a 'real names' server.
Eliran (Halim): yeahhh
Eliran (Halim): maybe
Bill: wait, did you bump the permissions Hal? I can see the change nickname option on BNE and Aurii.
Eliran (Halim): whatya mean
Bill: did you admin me?
Eliran (Halim): oh yeah
Bill: yeet
Bill: I suppose I have to make good on my promise to add a dab to Dizzy.
