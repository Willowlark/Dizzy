Bill: Shout out to Kurtis to be the one real mutual for the Pokémon thing. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Eliran (Halim): i haven't opened it recently cause it kills data and i hit my max :c
Aldus (Jess): Wait Pokemon go or the "what Pokemon are you" thing?
Bill: Maybe I should have gone to LCAC since I was in the city. Would have only been for an hour or two, but could have seen David.
Bill: Hindsight is 20/20.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> Your options are likely us or old squad. Admittedly I was thinking we'd go down by you if we can swing it work wise (probably would work), but if you wanted to come up by us that's lit too.
Afina (Georgia🍀): for the rwby showing?
Bill: yeah.
Afina (Georgia🍀): rutgers to rockaway is apparently only 50 mins
Bill: yeah, you'd be by us in no time.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i can do rockaway
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats where the most friendos are going while also being a reasonable distance lol
Bill: Not the most, but the best. 😎
Afina (Georgia🍀): Both!
Bill: Think Dave is going to show up just so he can have a pre movie drink. 🤣
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeeeeet
Bill: If you end up worried about driving back I work from home fridays, you’d be welcome to stay over and leave Friday.
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah its all good
Afina (Georgia🍀): i still have class friday morning anyways
Bill: Mhmm, offers there if you need it.
Bill: I'm buying ticket early, not a reserved seating theatre but probably still worth.
Aldus (Jess): CCE time off approved 👌
Bill: nicu
Bill: I'm going to put in that floating half day for the thursday.
Bill: Cause then I have an excuse why I won't be answering slacks.
