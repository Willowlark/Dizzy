Afina (Georgia🍀): so when hal and i went to davids graduation, the first thing allegra/sakura said to me was "be weiss for all these groups"
Afina (Georgia🍀): and then wanted me to do a bunch of stuff
Afina (Georgia🍀): including a team rwby at ANYC
Afina (Georgia🍀): and then she started doing the scheduling for it and was like "lets do it tuesday"
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i was like uhhh i wont be there friday?
Bill: Aaaaah.
Afina (Georgia🍀): and she was like "well we already planned stuff for saturday so it has to be friday"
Bill: Fuck em.
Aldus (Jess): Guess no weissu for you then Sakura!
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i was like "technically sundays an option" but also i dont know if im doing that, and suiting up in full weiss for a sunday is GANK
Bill: We’re going to ANYC to shop, maybe run a shoot, and hang out.
Afina (Georgia🍀): LIKE weiss is too much effort for a sunday
Bill: Maybe go someone where nice in the city.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah so like, im not doing that now
Afina (Georgia🍀): i just didnt appreciate the assuming and steamrolling like that
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😤
Bill: You tell her girl.
Afina (Georgia🍀): and like all she would talk about was cosplay with me
Afina (Georgia🍀): and what my cosplans are
Afina (Georgia🍀): and con plans
Afina (Georgia🍀): like i asked her about life and work and shit
Afina (Georgia🍀): UGH IDK SOMEONE SAW WEZREZ AND NOT GEORGIA I GUESS hhmmph
Bill: That’s sakura.
Afina (Georgia🍀): she messaged me about it in NC and im still upset about it
Afina (Georgia🍀): like how could she assume like that
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean i guess i lowkey do that too, like im like "hey does this work" to people and i assume that usually it does
Afina (Georgia🍀): but shes like "well that doesnt work for me so we cant do it"
Afina (Georgia🍀): like she didnt even have a reason other than the fact that she had different cosplay plans
Afina (Georgia🍀): i legitimately wasnt gonna be there friday
Aldus (Jess): Tell her to find a different Weiss then
Bill: She strikes me as someone with a clear division between friends and cosplay, and someone whose got tunnel vision regarding her hobbies.
Bill: I think ye the way she is.
Eliran (Halim): She doesnt have a clear division between friends in cosplay
Eliran (Halim): Cosplay is her thing
Eliran (Halim): She finds a similarity and latched to it hard
Eliran (Halim): Latches
Afina (Georgia🍀): idk it very much rubbed me the wrong way
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i see utility in the mangaloo defense squad now_
Eliran (Halim): Yeah
Bill: Assuming that much is over kill tho. Especially when you are so inflexible.
Bill: No witch hunting.
Eliran (Halim): Mangs defense group doesnt witch hunt
Eliran (Halim): They screen
Bill: Ah, that side of it.
Eliran (Halim): Jigglypuff was the only witch hunter, and  they very clearly dont like her
Bill: Sakura is like a work friend. She’s into her work, and outside of work she’s not really into friends. You don’t have to work with her if that’s not what you want, since you treat cosplay as a social hobby.
Nokri (Marisa): Did they change anything about the first day of kotori? It’s usually had stuff on Friday for the last several years but it’s only like 4 hours
Nokri (Marisa): I cant believe Georgia and Wezrez cosplay are two different people. Just like Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana
