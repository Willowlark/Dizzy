Bill: Gen wants to back out of RTX...?
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah saw that

Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably disheartened about Pyrrha
Aldus (Jess): is chris going?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah he booked the air b&b
Aldus (Jess): ah
Aldus (Jess): she was supposed to stay with u guys?
Aldus (Jess): sorry im not clear on the rtx rooming situation XD
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah Chris booked an Air b&b
Afina (Georgia🍀): And so cause they're dating she's there too lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): She doesn't give any other explanation other than "a gut feeling" so idk
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sounds sorta unfounded to me
Afina (Georgia🍀): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aldus (Jess): but thats where you guys are staying too?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee
Aldus (Jess): okay
Aldus (Jess): thats the p0art i didnt know
Aldus (Jess): she might if you pm her
Bill: I kinda get it... and that’s not because rtx sucks.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof I wanna talk to her but I'm in class til 2 and driving to Hals afterwards
Bill: Like, I’ve had “bad feeling” before.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I've had bad feelings about cons too but then I punt them away and have a good time
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like I had a bad feeling about last Otakon but we had so much fun didn't we?
Bill: Is it about the con or just generally?
Afina (Georgia🍀): The comments make it sound like it's con
Bill: I got the feeling the whole trip gave her a bad feeling.
Aldus (Jess): yea im getting the vibe its more liek the whole trip?
Aldus (Jess): how long are you staying, a whole week?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah they leave Wednesday arrive home Wednesday cause they driving
Afina (Georgia🍀): Me and hal leave Wednesday (flight) get home Monday night (flight, basically 2 am)
Aldus (Jess): hmmm i wanna ask her about it but i feel like i dont know her enough
Bill: If it was just Con worries yeah, she’s got a squad with her who will keep her happy even if rtx sucks.
Bill: But if it’s more than that as a gut feeling...
Bill: I know I trust mine.
Aldus (Jess): it might pass too, might just be how she's feeling right now
Bill: Absolutely yeah.
Aldus (Jess): id probably be scared too 😂
Bill: She's traveled for Otakon, and did an internship at Disney last year.
Aldus (Jess): maybe she associating the bad internship with rtx? cuz she had a bad time right?
Bill: Naaah, I mean, she wanted to come home big time, but I think she was lonely more than anything.
Aldus (Jess): or maybe there is some drama we arent seeing that making her hesitant
Bill: That wouldn't warrant public facebook post tho.
Bill: Unless she was doing some *serious* manipulation, and that's not her character.
Aldus (Jess): idk 🤷
Aldus (Jess): im just thinking of possibilities
Aldus (Jess): and i didnt mean it like that
Bill: I'm not accusing you of anything Jessjess. 😛
Afina (Georgia🍀): Drama? At RTX??? :V
Bill: I think Gen really is the type to wear her problems on her facebook wall.
Aldus (Jess): oh no i know!
Aldus (Jess): who else is in your airbnb?
Bill: I want to comment on it too, but since I'm not and do not ever want to go to RTX it feels kinda meddling.
