Nokri (Marisa): Is that new
They’ve had lipsync for your cosplay events based off RuPauls drag race for at least 4 years now
Bill: <@!228287793099440128> <@!351785752197201920> Have you heard anything from Joe about the room? He's good right?
Bill: and aware he likely sharing a bed?
Elfriede (Tom): I .. think
Elfriede (Tom): He's still good.fpr the room
Dave: Ill bring my air mattress, since it's a small one, incase
Bill: Dave is a hero.
Nokri (Marisa): h̒͑͛ ̐ͣ̑e̓̂̐ ̐̐ͭŕ̽̚ ͮ͑̆o͗̅̈́
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> I meant to ask at Otakon; why were you asking Jake about Nathaniel? Something happen at RTX where he's less of a nice guy?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh he just REALLY hung around Meg
Afina (Georgia🍀): To the point she was ~~highkey~~ uncomfortable
Afina (Georgia🍀): And he even pointed out that she was avoiding him
Afina (Georgia🍀): And still tried to hang out with her
Aldus (Jess): OOF
Afina (Georgia🍀): So he was a little problematic there
Bill: Same problem, just elevated.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeaaaah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like I don't think he was intentionally trying to make Meg incomfy
Afina (Georgia🍀): He just really likes her
Elfriede (Tom): Yeeee...
Bill: Obsessed. I mean, you don't buy plane tickets for people you don't know.
Bill: It's too much.
Bill: ~~Granted accepting is also a poor decision~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeaaah he doesn't have much money I don't think
Afina (Georgia🍀): But he paid angryjigglypuffs rent one time
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which is like wow
Afina (Georgia🍀): And he invited jennyplays to RTX even tho she doesn't watch anything roosterteeth
Bill: Yeah. Weird sensibilities.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah nothing outright malignant but some stuff he just doesn't "get"
Bill: I was curious, since last stance I was aware of was 'helpful spy in the drama filled land of RWBY fame'.
Afina (Georgia🍀): He still carries that title IMO but he's also someone that just can't seem to connect 2 and 2
Bill: And backing Meg is more important.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye she's a good person
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I feel closer to a lot of people at RTX
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~before it was just like "I kinda know you"~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also side note, I caught up on BNE, I wonder who Erik doesn't want seeing his stories 👀
Bill: I'll give you three guesses love.
Bill: First two don't count.
Nokri (Marisa): rwby needs characters in ballgowns so when something uncomfortable happens to cosplayers they can hide under the nearest hoopskirt
Aldus (Jess): steelwolf?
Afina (Georgia🍀): EthanEthanEthanEthanEthan
Bill: Nathaniel.
Afina (Georgia🍀): darn wishful thinking
Aldus (Jess): probaly all three
Bill: *Seriously? I don’t just think about Nathaniel randomly on a Monday morning.*
Bill: He said specifically Nathaniel.
Aldus (Jess): he did?
Afina (Georgia🍀): "no one in BNE"?
Aldus (Jess): musta missed it
Bill: DM.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH HO HO dang
Bill: Erik doesn’t like to make drama.
Aldus (Jess): ooooooooooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I think meg wants him out of their darlings group too
Bill: Erik is waiting for her to kick him.
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's gonna be rough
Afina (Georgia🍀): He messaged meg asking if they could just be normal friends
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause he only had a "passing interest" in her
Aldus (Jess): YEA RIGHT
Bill: Erik feels bad cause Nathaniel isn’t like, bad, just weird and Erik doesn’t want to ignore him but he does. I told him his discretion helps Meg avoid awkward situations, and that’s a noble act to make. Compared it to us making sure you never got stuck with steel at Katsu.
Eliran (Halim): Megs gonna kick Nathaniel at some point I think
Nokri (Marisa): send him this song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67gQ1v2iRZA
Eliran (Halim): Also hello just landed in Denver
Eliran (Halim): I got like 50 minutes till my next plane
Afina (Georgia🍀): h-hewwo?
Afina (Georgia🍀): O that's rad
Eliran (Halim): Yeah 100%sucks tm
Aldus (Jess): how long u in Hawaii?
Eliran (Halim): I get back the afternoon of the 27th
Aldus (Jess): nicu
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bring me back a volcano :V
Eliran (Halim): I have no bag space
Nokri (Marisa): if you can't bring back a volcano you have to go inside one
Nokri (Marisa): it's how things work
Eliran (Halim): Fear
Bill: ~~anyone else notice that, apart from Snow, only southern cosplayers cause drama?~~
Nokri (Marisa): must be the accent
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm starting drama to disprove this theory :V
Bill: Don't you dare.
Eliran (Halim): Are we considering Mist a part of starting drama at all
Eliran (Halim): I wouldn't but if we are shes from Pennsylvania
Nokri (Marisa): i'm here for drama who we messin' up
Bill: No one, the drama cycle closed out post RTX, though the threads for next season are in place.
Nokri (Marisa): new cosplay drama callout post for global warming
Eliran (Halim): Now that Erik is confirmed doesnt like Ethan I'm waiting for that drama to explode
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Bill: When was that confirmed.
Eliran (Halim): Well more implode
Eliran (Halim): Rtx
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH did we not tell that story?
Nokri (Marisa): 🇨 🇴 🇳 🇫 🇮 🇷 🇲 🇪 🇩
Eliran (Halim): Lissy confirmed it
Bill: Mangaloo isn't doing any rwby at CCE, so CCE is likely to be fairly relaxing (though I expect Georgia and Hal will get room party invite(s) which may be breeding grounds for new drama).
Aldus (Jess): i think you guys told us at katsu
Eliran (Halim): Yeah I thought we mentioned it
Nokri (Marisa): share! share!
Eliran (Halim): Basically lissy told us Erik puts up with him
Eliran (Halim): But like at rtx for example
Eliran (Halim): Ethan would come up to talk to him
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause Erik was with his friend who's name escapes me so we'll just call him Cool Guy and Cool Guy and Lissy we're talking with Erik. And some convo topic came up about people they don't like? And Cool Guy was like "oh yeah, like that douchey guy you hang out with" and Erik was like "Ethan? Yeah" so Lissy said that Erik essentially just tolerates Ethan
Eliran (Halim): And Erik would give him the nod and say yes while looking at his phone treatment
Eliran (Halim): I think its John or josh
Bill: John sounds right.
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooo
Bill: This isn't really news though.
Bill: It's nice that he'll admit it, but he was tolerating Ethan around when Georgia cut ties.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Verbal confirmation is new
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think
Bill: mhmm. But we knew.
Bill: Ethan was cheating him with the business, not treating him fairly...
Nokri (Marisa): when you say cool guy you say it in the voice right
Nokri (Marisa): there's no other way to say cool guy
Eliran (Halim): Its different 
Erik was still treating Ethan as a friend after the business fully died
Eliran (Halim): As he told Ethan my comments in BNE post thing and said he didnt like hearing shit talk about his friends in the chat
Eliran (Halim): (He said it in q much more polite and passive way tho)
Eliran (Halim): We've known he knew Ethan was an ass, before he was an asshole friend 
Now Erik thinks hes just an asshole that hell put up with
Bill: Fair enough.
Bill: and if we can ever get Leanna to hang with us, maybe we'll confirm we've rescued her as well.
Aldus (Jess): erik just puts up with him cuz he doesnt want drama
Bill: But I've had enough of the drama catch up this morning.
Bill: Thank god CCE should be mostly clear of it.
Aldus (Jess): WHOO CCE LES GOOOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): bill when was the best time to shoot for CCE?
Bill: I had said we'd shoot 11-2 with our group + Leanna now, do shoots, and I'd stow my camera after that. I think I'll have my camera out longer though, as long as everyone doesn't do the water park without me.
Afina (Georgia🍀): okie dokey
Afina (Georgia🍀): should i just set aside the whole 11-2 time chunk then?
Afina (Georgia🍀): just wondering cause im making mah schedule
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~super productivity today post vacation woohoo~~
Bill: Are you planning on doing anything else?
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah i was just wondering in case i stumbled on a meet up in that time slot but i havent
Afina (Georgia🍀): that works well too cause nier is 2 pm friday and rwby is 2 pm saturday if you wanted pics of those
Bill: if you need to do we could focus the block, but I quite frankly am treating it as '3 hours of focused photos before fucking around the rest of the day'.
Bill: ~~I'm running both of those remember~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): idk brotato maybe you got tired of taking group shoot pics 😜
Afina (Georgia🍀): but ye ill chunk off 11-2 then
Bill: ~~actually~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i love not having commitments before 11_
Bill: ~~because no one would expect you to get up before then~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): realistic expectations tbh
Bill: Don't I know it.
Bill: Also I'll definitely do photos for Nier, it's going to be super small. like, RWBY at Kogarafest small.
Bill: RWBY...
Bill: hmm.
Bill: What’s your meetup?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i didnt find any but im trying to surf through events on facebook n
Afina (Georgia🍀): so i was wondering just in case
Afina (Georgia🍀): though i doubt anyones gonna make a star or fallout meet up, and thats the only fandoms that are unaccounted for r/n
Bill: Star has been big recently.
Afina (Georgia🍀): true, with the final season comin up
Bill: It's just been extra popular at cons.
Elfriede (Tom): I don't wanna plan anything.for collosal
Elfriede (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): now that im back from so much travel im in need of work to do
Afina (Georgia🍀): so ive been planning all day boom boom boom all my medical appointments, cosplay stuff, everything
Bill: feeling refreshed?
Afina (Georgia🍀): im almost sick of vacationing if that makes any sense
Afina (Georgia🍀): i need some STRUCTURE
Afina (Georgia🍀): not just waking up at 11 going "what am i gonna do today"
Elfriede (Tom): Oh yeah I get that way too
Bill: mm.
Bill: refreshed is different tho, you seemed shot by the end of Otakon.
Bill: ~~I'm not going to end up socializing at all at BNE because I want to do photos for everyone I can~~
Bill: ~~why am I like this~~
Elfriede (Tom): I wonder how this is gonna go
Bill: Who knows.
