Nokri (Marisa): they've even got a photographer spot <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): i don't recommend staff suite though. that's essentially sitting in a hotel room all day, and con attendees aren't allowed in the staff suite so you can't interact with any attendees. just tired staff who are constantly in a hurry and too exhausted to do anything so they stare at a TV with johnny test playing while eating a stale sandwich
Bill: I’m not staffing tho.
Bill: October 27th is the photo plus expo in NYC. Any takers on checking it out with me? The “dealers” Hall is free, which is what I’m thinking I’ll visit for. So only cost is the train in.
Bill: Unless that’s when you’re planning Halloween Georgia. That’d be first priority.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee that's Halloweenie
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's the weekend before Halloween itself I think (which is a Wednesday ew)
Bill: Ah, well screw the expo then.
Bill: None of the con stuff is happening till later thursday...
Bill: Kalahari has that spa...
Nokri (Marisa): naruto gets a massage
Elfriede (Tom): Doo oi5t
Bill: Maybe.
Bill: for your reference, there's couple massages.

Afina (Georgia🍀): Ok I think total what I'm packing for CCE: Swimsuit A2, Swimsuit Pyrrha, Yona, Sole Survivor, and possibly I'll throw my Weiss wig in my bag
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh and swim Ladybug
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's the same swimsuit as Pyrrha just a different wig lol
Bill: Sole Survivor?
Bill: Does Weiss wig mean ponytail, or wig in general, cause I thought you were doing post haircut A2.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sole survivor in case I feel like actual cosplay at some point
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Weiss means + ponytail
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause I need the short version for A2, so I'm gonna throw the ponytail in there just in case I feel like being swimsuit Weiss somewhere in there
Bill: 👌
Bill: and then do the thing where you put a scar on your tum like you been stabbed. XP
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH TRAGEDY
Bill: what suit would you wear with Weiss tho? 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably the black and white polka dot bottoms
Afina (Georgia🍀): And?? Idk
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's mostly just in case I need more WOOBY lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not stressing it
Bill: nicu!
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I'mma bring full Adam if I'm feeling it
