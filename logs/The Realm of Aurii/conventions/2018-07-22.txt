Bill: @everyone Zenkai rook blocks at 9am Monday.
Aldus (Jess): ðŸ‘Œ
Nokri (Marisa): Ye post processionâ€™ takes forever for some images. I imagine inoue spends a long time on it and thatâ€™s part of the reason they charge so much but occasionally Iâ€™ve had to spend several hours just on one picture.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~fix your costumes so they donâ€™t have to be photoshopped correctly and cover up your tattoos so they donâ€™t need to be edited out~~
Bill: 
Bill: Shit weâ€™re missing it.
Aldus (Jess): ðŸ˜­
Bill: *Did someone say shipping?*

*No one did, I said it myself*
Bill: So I tried to cheat the system for Zenkai. No doubles available (90% sure because the block isnâ€™t available till tomorrow) BUT kings were available. So as a safety net, we have three king rooms booked.
Bill: Will be doing the double hunt in the morning.
