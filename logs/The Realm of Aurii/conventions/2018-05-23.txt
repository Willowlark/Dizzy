Aldus (Jess): That's the day before the shoot mark set up
Afina (Georgia🍀): temptinggggg
Bill: Did you see the 55 dollar price tag?
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeh and looking at pics i dont think its worth it
Afina (Georgia🍀): that main hall is cool but otherwise meh
Bill: I'm unimpressed by the shots they put up as well.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like the main hall sucked me in but the other places dont look TOO great for photo ops
Afina (Georgia🍀): as far as backdrop
Bill: ye. agreed.
Bill: This organizer has booked the japanese house at the philadelphia gardens though, that's quite legit.
