Bill: I got the name of a karaoke place not in new york, it's byob so Georgia won't be banned, and it's a little over an hour away. 6 bucks an hour.
Bill: Downside, it's pretty *close* to new york, so it's going to be like going to CPAC per say.
Bill: *Upside*, it's a few miles from Mitsuwa Marketplace so we can go there as part of the trip.
Afina (Georgia): huh thats not bad
Bill: Yeah. ~~It's not optional this is happening~~
