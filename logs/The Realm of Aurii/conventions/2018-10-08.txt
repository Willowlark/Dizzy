Bill: Actually though how many tags have you gotten from the flannel fam nonsense?
Aldus (Jess): Oh now it's nonsense? 😛
Afina (Georgia): everything ive been tagged on is up in the flannel fam highlight
Afina (Georgia): and that highlight is gettin preeeetty long
Afina (Georgia): 22 separate people have used the flannel fam hashtag or in some way @'d me
Bill: Have you been following the tag?
Bill: Can you do that?
Afina (Georgia): nah cause other people have used the hashtag before me
Afina (Georgia): it was a pre-existing hashtag with like 1k posts
Bill: ~~I started using it you know~~
Bill: Still, lot of tags. Probably better than people going “nice” in replies.
