Bill: *Wow* thats the second time Rei has announced Georgia holds a party for Georgia.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784>
Afina (Georgia🍀): When I tell you I hosted everything in high school, I hosted everything
Bill: I know you hosted it, you told me about how last years went.
Bill: Personally I’d want to tell people myself though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeaaaah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk
Afina (Georgia🍀): Reiley's kinda like that
Afina (Georgia🍀): They think I have my shit together always 100% of the time unless I say otherwise
Afina (Georgia🍀): (I guess I give off that vibe 😎)
Afina (Georgia🍀): So they assume I'm always good to host
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which is fine, I would have done it anyways probably
Elfriede (Tom): 🚷
Bill: Just puts pressure on you to do so, in the case you might *not* want to.
Bill: Because it’s a public setting Rei is putting you forward in.
Afina (Georgia🍀): True true
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which means they must explicitly WANT me to host it
Bill: I’m sure they do. But pressuring you into it isn’t the way to express that. I doubt it’s intentional, to be clear. I just don’t like that kind of thing cause it would make me a bit uncomfortable.
Bill: ~~I was expecting you to Halloween too after all, and I’m glad for it cause no one else we (NRTH) does~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i dont do the holidays, i just do new years, so im grateful for gingerbread 😄
Bill: You’re welcome to Christmas Eve as well, if you don’t have family obligations.
Bill: Daycons in fall: ANYC, Kogara (it's free, might as well again?), I think Derpy?
Afina (Georgia🍀): whens kogara?
Bill: No idea.
Bill: some weekend in october or november.
Bill: it was second weekend of october last year. No news on it being run again this year tho.
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats not a good sign oops
Bill: I mean, it's not something you have to plan too far in advance for anyway.
Bill: they also don't have Kogaracon 2019 listed, so they may be behind schedule.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i do for work schedules lol
Bill: oh shit right.
Afina (Georgia🍀): my whole schedule is full up through november so id have to move things arond
Bill: Was it on a sunday?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i dont remember....
Bill: Nope, Saturday.
Afina (Georgia🍀): poo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill was the total for CCE 184 per person?
Bill: yeah.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Okie dokey just making sure
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm calculating how many extra hours to get next week lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): I get paid next Friday so I'll transfer you the muns then 👏
Bill: no problem.
Afina (Georgia🍀): That photographer pass for CCE is weird
Bill: I don't get it.
Bill: Good thing i don't care cause I don't charge.

Aldus (Jess): yea but the buffet is like $22 or smth
Aldus (Jess): nope, sorry no spending that much money to fill up in 10 seconds
Bill: tru.
Aldus (Jess): now if you could pay 22, and return all day for food that would be worth
