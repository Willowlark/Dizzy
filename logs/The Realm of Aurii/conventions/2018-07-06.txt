Dave: anyone else going to try for nycc?
Bill: NYCC? Nah, too crowded.
Afina (Georgia🍀): You need to have submitted your evaluation for it like forever ago I think
Afina (Georgia🍀): My coworker reminded me of the last day for submissions like 10 years ago lol
Nokri (Marisa): If you’ve gone before you have until Sunday I think. They keep sending out emails
Aldus (Jess): They evaluate you?
Bill: no fake nerd girls allowed.
Aldus (Jess): Lmao
Dave: shit, i wont be allowed then
Nokri (Marisa): You have to fill out like a pre pre registration
Bill: but ye nope Dave. I'm thinking about going to liberty city in august, and will do ANYC again.
Bill: Not comic con.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): *are you a real fan*
Aldus (Jess): What even is this? Like what do they ask you? Wtfff
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's to prevent scalpers
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I guess I get jt
Bill: and heather is the first person to ask about colossal east shoots!
Bill: *For shame, Georgia!* 😛
Bill: I ain't booking anything though. My schedule is fuck around with camera until group shoot, group shoot, then swim and drink.
Aldus (Jess): what was she askin for?
Bill: She didn't say.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😮
Afina (Georgia🍀): i thoughT IT WAS IMPLIED
Afina (Georgia🍀): when we all went "watah ~~flowah~~ fall?"
Bill: ~~girl I live for your over eager enthusiasm with these shoots~~ Tru it was.
Afina (Georgia🍀): p h e w
Bill: But anyway, ye. Like, if we bump into her in the morning, heck, yeah, I'll photo.
Aldus (Jess): oh yea i was thinking the same thing
Bill: Or if I decide to keep the camera a little later, or we shoot the shit after rwby.
Bill: what same thing?
Aldus (Jess): the implied waterfall thing
Bill: Oh yea, I basically pointed out what we should shoot this time around.
Bill: Given swimsuits, photos are kinda back burner? Is that it?
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeee
Aldus (Jess): ~~swimsuit photos get mad likes~~
Bill: Not exactly, but we're keeping it personal.
Bill: ~~and dick pics~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean as long as i have nier and jnpr covered thats good
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): id prob like hak and yona photos but i gotta see with hal bout that
Afina (Georgia🍀): omg
Aldus (Jess): we could always snap phone pics too if billy is busy or doesnt have camera
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeet!
Bill: They're doing Hak/Yona sunday, odds are I'll have camera.
Bill: and also I *just* said I'm staying *not* busy this con.
Aldus (Jess): im laying out a text book and the chapter im on keeps talking about "electromagnetic waves" <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i was worried you were offended i hadnt asked explicitly yet_
Aldus (Jess): what i mean is if you dont wanna take pics
Bill: what, about Hak Yona?
Afina (Georgia🍀): :3c
Afina (Georgia🍀): CCE do you mean electromagnetic waves
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): thats what i think everytime i read it
Bill: What I meant before is I dig your enthusiasm cause I thrive off it. Gets me more motivated.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _im very enthusiastic about the waterfall yes_
Bill: SO when you JNPR WOOO I'm more excited for it, etc.
Bill: One of the reasons I really enjoy shoots with you, honestly.
Aldus (Jess): i mean i kinda think thats the only reason tom wants to bring full ren at all?
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Full JNPR tho...
Aldus (Jess): sometimes enthusiasm isnt so WHOOO its more subtle
Bill: Should do like... Hiking!JNPR.
Aldus (Jess): ~~plus i never wanna bother you~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^
Bill: I appreciate your subtle enthusiasm as well Jess. I know you, I got you covered.
Aldus (Jess): oh ok, yea cuz i cant still be really camera shy even though i dont wanna be
Aldus (Jess): like i want pics but i feel awkward getting them taken XD
Bill: You've gotten much less awkward with photos recently.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mostly wanna square away jnpr and nier and everything else is like.......... if it happens it happens
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOO IMPROVEMENT
Bill: Next was a *world* different for you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 👏
Aldus (Jess): practice helps hehe
Bill: You've got confidence being 2B, it shows.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye!
Aldus (Jess): ~~i dont think i make a great 2b tho~~ but yea i guess i do
Bill: And Lilith actually, you could tell at Zenkai.
Bill: YOU ARE BEEEEEEEAUTIFULLLLLLLL IN EVERRRRRRRY SINNNNNNGLE WAAAAAAY
Aldus (Jess): ~~i just like being sexy~~
Bill: *just imagine my voice cracking*
Aldus (Jess): dont worry i did
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^
Aldus (Jess): sexy is easy lmao as weird as that sounds
Afina (Georgia🍀): naaah fam its not for everyone
Afina (Georgia🍀): you just a natural
Aldus (Jess): oh thank
Bill: and Georgia, JNPR and Nier is squared away. from whenever we roll out of the rooms till group shoots we do photos. Waterfall, wave pool, outdoor pool, etc.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOOOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): ready 2 get gay
Aldus (Jess): i mean i dont think theres any cosplays i feel unconfident in, i just feel more confident certain days XD
Bill: mhmm, we all do. I've had days I loved shooting and others where I wanted everyone to die.
Bill: My guess is sexy works for you because you are, in your way, sexy. You'd be slower to adjusting to insane, like Nora, because she's further from your own personality.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ✨ natural sexy ✨
Bill: yeet.
Bill: *I just told Jess she has sexy in her personality, what a day*
Afina (Georgia🍀): SHE DO THO
Aldus (Jess): i suppose so.  I enjoy being Nora though, i think i did her well at katsu
Aldus (Jess): oh thank
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye you did! and then you added SEXY HAMMER for MAXIMUM POTENCY
Bill: We like being different, different isn't bad either. You my favorite Nora.
Aldus (Jess): all my cosplays are crazy, sexy, or edgy
Bill: 100% true, and I mean Nora as Nora, not Renora.
Bill: Standalone Jess Nora is best Nora.
Aldus (Jess): nah
Bill: *Where's my oh thank*

*How dare*
Aldus (Jess): ~~thank you~~
Aldus (Jess): i dont think im the best anything tho
Bill: <@&455787357426417674> IS THE BEST NORA EVER!
Aldus (Jess): D:
Bill: Tru, cosplay isn't a competition. But personally, I like you best as Nora.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEEE
Aldus (Jess): thats only cuz im your fren
Bill: https://giphy.com/gifs/ceeN6U57leAhi
Afina (Georgia🍀): probably could use a few more pictures with pancakes tho to really cement that title ~~hint hint nudge nudge~~
Bill: Gen is my friend too.
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Bill: You my favorite because you are stupid, I don't lie.
Aldus (Jess): WHAT
Aldus (Jess): did u just call me stupid?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh
Aldus (Jess): oh nvm that could be read wrong
Bill: *if you say stupid things you are stupid~~~*
Afina (Georgia🍀): he done it nowwwwwwwwwwww
Bill: oh I see what you read, there should be a comma in there.
Aldus (Jess): i thought you were saying your my fav nora cuz you're stupid
Aldus (Jess): and im like WELP
Bill: Yeah, sorry, need them commas.
Bill: And to refute the friend argument, if it was Georgia in Nora I'd still choose you. So there. BEST NORA.
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~dude i would still choose jess too lol~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): noras got too much energy for me
Afina (Georgia🍀): yang and lux are energetic but its a diff kind of energy
Aldus (Jess): so ya'll saying i *am* crazy
Bill: Oh yeah, when did I ever deny *that*?
Aldus (Jess): oh yea nora is hard to do on no coffee yo
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah noras energy is like enthusiastic energy
Aldus (Jess): ok tru
Afina (Georgia🍀): yang and lux energy is just confident energy
Bill: Yang is like, Sassy.
Afina (Georgia🍀): tho not necessarily inundating
Afina (Georgia🍀): kinda more flirty in a way?
Afina (Georgia🍀): but not quite
Aldus (Jess): yo i was so hype to be nora at katsu
Bill: Yeah, she's sexual but not defined by it.
Aldus (Jess): shit now i wanna bring nora to CCE
Bill: hence Sassy.
Aldus (Jess): frick
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~i saw you and tom beaming as we all walked through the con center <:lenny:395307171539189760> ~~
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): but even that morning i was like HYPPEE to get ready
Bill: ~~I would have saw that if I wasn't off fucking dying, fuck Katsu~~
Aldus (Jess): that whole day i was high on some energy
Bill: ~~or Roman's pot brownies~~
Aldus (Jess): like nonstop, i didnt even wanna go to sleep XD
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah i was lookin cause i was like i wonder if theyre even having fun
Afina (Georgia🍀): and they both smiling and stuffs like

Afina (Georgia🍀): and you and tom were like 😄
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i was like ~~excellent, pocket ren and nora~~ o wow theyre havin a lot of fun!
Bill: ~~they're my pocket rwbies than you very much~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~the bonds of jnpr cannot be broken, and pyrrhas are rare so if they are broken theyre very hard to replace~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ***checkmate***
Bill: Meg.
Bill: Gen.
Bill: There's two.
Bill: Rebecca.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~2/3 of those dont have a full set of armor yet~~
Aldus (Jess): georgia can't be replaced
Afina (Georgia🍀): ❤
Aldus (Jess): we have canon height differences
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH!
Bill: ~~She said Pyrrha not Georgia~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): really tho pyrrhas a struggle, i understand why theres so few
Afina (Georgia🍀): gens struggling with armor, rebeccas remaking almost all of hers
Afina (Georgia🍀): meg is on her like, 7th remake of armor
Afina (Georgia🍀): idk if shes completely happy yet
Bill: And Meg didn't make everything herself, she bought the corset...
Afina (Georgia🍀): also true
Afina (Georgia🍀): she told me she cant sew and doesnt really wanna make that part of her repertoire
Bill: I feel like she's your type, with the have to make it all herself thing.
Aldus (Jess): oo that reminds me i was going to order a pettern to make my own hiyori cuz mine looks like GARBO on me
Afina (Georgia🍀): meg?
Bill: Meg ye.
Aldus (Jess): nah she isnt
Afina (Georgia🍀): not with sewing
Aldus (Jess): she bought her franxx custume
Afina (Georgia🍀): neither am i for some things, like myrtenaster
Aldus (Jess): was yuripee bought?
Bill: ye.
Aldus (Jess): ok i thought so
Aldus (Jess): cuz its the same material as hiyori but actualy fits you
Aldus (Jess): mines like a stiff cardboard nightmare
Afina (Georgia🍀): GURL NO IT DONT those bobbies are squeezed in
Afina (Georgia🍀): i had to like shove them in and button lol
Aldus (Jess): but they still look good
Afina (Georgia🍀): o thank
Bill: Did indeed. But Jess meant shaping, not actual size.
Afina (Georgia🍀): my squished bobbies appreciate knowing that they suffered for beauty
Aldus (Jess): hiyori i have to cram them in and they look all flat and nasty
Aldus (Jess): like almost as flat as my binder XD
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye remakes are understandable if you dont feel good in it
Bill: she bought Hiyori tho.
Aldus (Jess): ye and i found a pattern so it should be easy
Aldus (Jess): ok so its not a re-nake
Bill: re nakked?
Aldus (Jess): its a make
Aldus (Jess): shh you
Aldus (Jess): i can sew as long as i have a pattern, no pattern im still leary of but tom did it for leo so i could proob fogure it out
Afina (Georgia🍀): it works better for some things than others
Afina (Georgia🍀): i can sew a sweater sans pattern but forget doing a corset patternless
Aldus (Jess): https://www.amazon.com/Simplicity-Creative-Patterns-8160-4-6-8-10-12/dp/B01EFF9QUK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1530909141&sr=8-2&keywords=Simplicity+8160
Aldus (Jess): like thats exact so <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): o ye i have that pattern too lol
Aldus (Jess): oh neato! yea i figure itll probably come in handy again
Aldus (Jess): dunno when ill get to it but yea
Bill: winter.
Aldus (Jess): possibly
Aldus (Jess): ugu i wanna con before CCE RIP
Bill: Booking Ota for next year, not making this mistake again.
Bill: Liberty city in August.

Aldus (Jess): ill just google it
Afina (Georgia🍀): its 18-19 i believe
Bill: three day.
Bill: Ryan said expense for what it had there, but con + times square. Basically Kinda but in NYC.
Aldus (Jess): 55 for just saturday
Aldus (Jess): oof
Aldus (Jess): 60 for full weekend, but we prob wouldnt stay right?
Bill: I mean, probabty expensive but NYC at night would be cool.
Bill: Plus 2 hour train rides back.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ouch
Aldus (Jess): ya i wouldnt wanna take friday off tho
Bill: Nah, me either.
Aldus (Jess): ooo idk theres pros and cons LOL CONS
Bill: If you had the time to make it or the money to buy it, would you redo Yurippe Georgia?
Aldus (Jess): apparently there is some small con in morristown this weekend? or maybe it was last?
Aldus (Jess): cuz my friend was like "wait what you're not going?" and i was like "huh?"
Aldus (Jess): ooo its garden state comic fest
Afina (Georgia🍀): prob not
Afina (Georgia🍀): the cost isnt worth re-wearing it maybe one or two more times
Aldus (Jess): thats like comic centered thou so that would explain why i didnt care about it
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats prob at the old anext con center
Aldus (Jess): nah old a next concenter is shut down
Aldus (Jess): its at the William G. Mennen Sports Arena
Bill: Except that Angel Beats needs love tho.
Aldus (Jess): but she already has it and it looks fine so why remake it?
Bill: She did just say it was really tight on her right?
Aldus (Jess): yea but it looks fine so id think its worth dealing with over remaking
Bill: as we've learned with Pyrrha, being comfortable is part of a good cosplay.
Aldus (Jess): its mostly shoes thou
Aldus (Jess): like thats the big comfort stealer anything else is deal-able to me atleast
Bill: remake, throw money at, same difference right?
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah my level of care for angel beats is kinda waning
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill always appreciate the anime but cosplaying it is another story
Bill: Or completely waned, as far as cosplay goes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeaaaah
Afina (Georgia🍀): the cosplay is worth squeezing another wear or two, if only to cosplay with buddies
Afina (Georgia🍀): but im not attached to the cosplay
Bill: yeah...
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean ive had it for three years ya know
Afina (Georgia🍀): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: Would make a poor birthday present then lol.
Bill: back to the drawing board. 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): you got the weezer tickets tho!

Afina (Georgia🍀): i never keep straight when i get gifts i just remember who got them lol
Bill: lol yeah. I bought them in the terminal to go to Canada for the christmas party.
Afina (Georgia🍀): GOOD LUCK DEN
Aldus (Jess): LOL
Afina (Georgia🍀): tho i dont think im a horrible person to gift shop for
Afina (Georgia🍀): like my dad, doesnt need or want anything, total minimalist
Afina (Georgia🍀): at the end of the day, fallout and space are all good thematic gifts for da georgia
Bill: Eh. I'm with Tom, I don't like gifts for specific reasons.
Aldus (Jess): biru and tom are hard to shop for
Aldus (Jess): they just buy things when they want them so by the time you know hey wanted it its allready been bought
Bill: I get gifts cause I decide to. Hence edible arrangements on Tom and Jess's dating anniversary.
Aldus (Jess): YEEEY
Bill: pfft yeah okay, that's me.
Bill: if it helps, I suffer the same thing trying to get my Dad gifts.
Aldus (Jess): but thats still for an occasion
Bill: But it's not 'a birthday gift'.
Aldus (Jess): just for onr im not supposed to celebrate anymore
Aldus (Jess): but i do anyway cuz i can HA
Bill: Like, the expectation kinda ruins it?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I understand how you're that way, you surprised me with the space playing cards and space pen before and I was like WHOAOAOA
Bill: I'll see something and be like 'Person A would like this, or it reminds me of them', and I buy it. That's it.
Aldus (Jess): I like both
Aldus (Jess): Both is good
Bill: 😛
Aldus (Jess): I also don't really expect gifts from friends on holiday

Aldus (Jess): Could have?
Eliran (Halim): Tom League :o
Bill: Do you see me dating anyone right now?
Aldus (Jess): Well they don't mean right now
Aldus (Jess): You said "could a good digger" so I was asking if you meant could have
Eliran (Halim): What do you mean by a gold digger problem
Eliran (Halim): Are you the gold digger
Eliran (Halim): Or is there somebody gold digging you
Bill: As in someone would date me for money. Computer science and all that.
Aldus (Jess): People would be good digging him
Bill: I don’t make *that* much though.
Bill: Me, a gold digger. That’s hilarious too tho.
