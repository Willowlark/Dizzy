Nokri (Marisa): the tickets for the cosplay show i got were for after the con, which ended at five, and then the show was at the con at 6:30. it's weird how that worked. but the people in line by me spoke english and were from malaysia so it wasn't an hour and a half of sitting in silence.

also wow that was better than any US masquerade we gotta learn from these guys who wants to do a masq skit next year

also there was a nier skit with 2B, 9S, and A2 that was super cool i didn't know you guys came to the con
Nokri (Marisa): kill la kill is getting a video game and kingdom hearts three looks awesome
Aldus (Jess): ðŸ˜®
Nokri (Marisa): there were 2 nier skits and in the first one the 2b dropped her sword i felt so bad for her but she looked flawless just like u
Aldus (Jess): I was going to say that was me until you said flawless
Nokri (Marisa): OH AND i got approached by like 6 members of the press omg. one was from the UK branch of CBS news, one was for NIntendo Life, one was a part of Tokyo Game Show staff, and i dunno what the others were for i think i got some business cards from them but they were just like "press, ok?" and was like "yeAH ðŸ‘Œ "
