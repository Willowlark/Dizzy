Nokri (Marisa): Biru stealing my GoPro hula hoop video idea that I stole
Bill: Audrey left BNE.
Nokri (Marisa): whaaa why
Nokri (Marisa): was she embarassed by her father
Bill: I mean, she was never very talkative, the age gap, and her Dad.
Bill: But it's a little sad.
Bill: I really wish discord notified when people leave server.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah i was just wondering that. i wonder when it happened and if her dad knows, and if he'd leave if he found out
Bill: Her Dad has been more involved with us than she has.
Nokri (Marisa): which i've also found a bit odd/interesting but whatever floats ya boat
Aldus (Jess): i mean shes?14? it might be a little hard to relate to us for her
Bill: ye, said the age gap.
Nokri (Marisa): but outright leaving the server. gasp.
Nokri (Marisa): maybe there's a bot that can sense when someone leaves a server that you can put in a hidden channel
Nokri (Marisa): nsa-style
Bill: I entirely could rig something like that.
Bill: but effort.
