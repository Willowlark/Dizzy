Aldus (Jess): omggg
Elfriede (Tom): Wow is that still relevant
Elfriede (Tom): Damnn
Nokri (Marisa): has it ever not been relevant
Aldus (Jess): ~~how many MM panels are we missing~~
Nokri (Marisa): asking the real questions üëå
Nokri (Marisa): looks like cheritz has a big 3 hour panel planned saturday
Aldus (Jess): :O!
Aldus (Jess): *drive 6 hrs to DC for 3 hr panel and 6 hrs back home*
Nokri (Marisa): dont forget paying that $100 badge fee <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): pocket change
Nokri (Marisa): Do peeps have any plans for next katsucon
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760> I mean I think the rooms are booked but that's about it for me and jess
Nokri (Marisa): Don‚Äôt you have your lives planned out for the next 30 years every minor detail
Aldus (Jess): üò±
Aldus (Jess): i can barely keep track of my plans for the next month
Nokri (Marisa): Whatcha feelin for Katsu
Aldus (Jess): cold
Bill: I know what could warm it up...
Nokri (Marisa): Fire from the maid cafe
Aldus (Jess): :o?
Nokri (Marisa): owo
Aldus (Jess): what could warm it up
Nokri (Marisa): Fire from the maid cafe
Bill: I don't think that's it...
Aldus (Jess): ~~is it alcohol?~~
Nokri (Marisa): ur right even though everyone blamed the maids it was from a maintenance room
Nokri (Marisa): NO
Nokri (Marisa): Katsucon is cancelled
Bill: That'd be problematic wouldn't it, *considering...*
Nokri (Marisa): Georgia is a minor
Bill: *CON.SID.ER.ING*
Aldus (Jess): considering what?!ahhhhhhhhhhhhh tell me the secret
Nokri (Marisa): katsucon is run by the illuminati
Bill: ~~That explains the pricing~~
Bill: Need the same kinda warmth you found at Konkon. That kinda of warmth.
Nokri (Marisa): does anyone have any solid katsu plans yet
Nokri (Marisa): that's why no one ever leaves the gaylord except when it's on fire which is ironic
Aldus (Jess): group hugs and hot chocolate?
Elfriede (Tom): YES
Bill: Mm, but there's something missing... I think is missing...
Elfriede (Tom): I'm down
Nokri (Marisa): consent. that's what missing.
Bill: What *could it be*?
Nokri (Marisa): the most important thing is consent
Elfriede (Tom): Hug consent
Aldus (Jess): kisses? üòö
Elfriede (Tom): Do we have concentrated to hug you Marisa?
Nokri (Marisa): *consentually*
Nokri (Marisa): fill out forms in triplicate
Bill: something to make the hugs and hot chocolate *just like back then...*
Nokri (Marisa): gotta get consent bureaucratically
Bill: Georgia has a vague plan.
Nokri (Marisa): oo nice
Nokri (Marisa): people thought zenkaikon's theme was furries that was fun
Nokri (Marisa): but katsu is before zenkai

Nokri (Marisa): it can all change though my first drafts are never what i end up bringing
Nokri (Marisa): world is mine miku is super casual so maybe for like the car ride. ~~cosplay just for the car ride~~

Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): mc has baggy clothes and a long wig you could probably hide seven's entire cosplay under it
Elfriede (Tom): Glad to hear you're coming owo
Aldus (Jess): this is the greatest day of my life
Nokri (Marisa): until katsu itself when we do tsundere russian roulette and u get presents
Aldus (Jess): dark saeran could be neat cuz we could be like 2 sides of same coin
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i hide the presents in the cookies~~
~~you bite into a cookie and inside it.... a 1/6 scale figure of lelouch!!!~~
Aldus (Jess): WOW thats be awesome
Nokri (Marisa): nice excitement edit üëå

Aldus (Jess): ~~shit~~
Elfriede (Tom): üôå üôå üôå
Nokri (Marisa): katarina might be a pain to make so quickly. i might hold off on her for zenkai. but i'd like to try competing in a contest and i can't do that at zenkai if i'm helping run the contest. ~~katsu's contest is impossible anyway aaa~~
Elfriede (Tom): Katsu 2019 got better, there is now a Marisa panel, guest appearance
Nokri (Marisa): my panel is a combination of in-depth discussion on the fascist implications of certain hatoful boyfriend endings, and staring into a mirror making sure the wig is kind of ok i guess
Aldus (Jess): that sounds great
Nokri (Marisa): hatoful kareshi cosplay group when
Nokri (Marisa): o for zenkai i'll probably be staffing so i won't be able to room with y'all but i can try to offload my hours early in the morning when possible.
late night zenkai is a toss-up because the asexual squad runs the 18+ cosplay events
Aldus (Jess): MARISA'S COMING BACK THE EAST COAST US CON SCENE <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

Nokri (Marisa): only if you're crossplaying
Elfriede (Tom): Understandable
Nokri (Marisa): do y'all allow ironing in the room when it's relatively empty because i like to iron a lot but i can bring easy wrinkled stuff in a bag if ironing is an issue
Aldus (Jess): YE! rayna ironed at anext and then we used the board as a second counter infront of the other mirror
Nokri (Marisa): bless. y'all are too pure
Aldus (Jess): cuz 5 people doing makeup got v. croweded
Aldus (Jess): but katsu has double sinks bless
Nokri (Marisa): i was ironing at otakon and the aldus cosplayer was amazed i don't think he ever ironed before and he was like "woah you're a really hardcore cosplayer aren't you, doing this pro thing. ironing."
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH KATSU HAS REALLY NICE SINKS
Nokri (Marisa): i've mastered the japanese cosplay art of getting into cosplay in the confines of a 1 square foot space
Aldus (Jess): aldus doesn't iron its canon
Nokri (Marisa): one of afina's servants is ironing and he's like "woah even your servants are skilled in magic"

Elfriede (Tom): I could
Nokri (Marisa): depending on black friday i might be able to buy volume 4 ruby (either the pre-made costume or enough supplies to make it) if you need a ruby for your jnpr, but katsu is really pretty and fancy so ray is a must ~~also it's a warm costume~~
Nokri (Marisa): *do it* no pressure
Nokri (Marisa): we could do the triple baka saeran comic irl
Aldus (Jess): choose your fighter
Nokri (Marisa): my crescent rose is kind of melted though i'd have to see if i can repair it
