Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Thatâ€™s weird
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): How do you have four people in a room for a con thatâ€™s so empty ðŸ™€
Bill: The sussex locals don't travel there and the rest of the Rowan bois don't either.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Who they?
Bill: Locals are Justin and Rayna. Rowan bois are John and Aaron.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): (who they)
Aldus (Jess): justin is our mine and toms friend from college, rayna is his gf, and also our friend
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): (Iâ€™m just pulling legs here and not being serious) bUT 9 people in a room is hardly sardine packing. 11 maybe. But nine is fine.
Bill: Wait.
Bill: You were never serious about putting 9 people in a room?
Bill: Like, in the past.
