Elfriede (Tom): Ooo nice!
Elfriede (Tom): Still awesome
Bill: I doubt colossal will add a formal.
Bill: I don't think OG CE has one.
Aldus (Jess): i dont think a formal at nakedcon would go over well
Bill: Ah yes, nothing like slow dancing, slowly getting closer together, ditching the hover hand for actually touching her, until your dancing bathing suit to bathing suit.
Bill: It's wet, kinda sticky, and really fucking cold.
Bill: How beautiful an image.
Aldus (Jess): wow sounds like fun

Aldus (Jess): for the water park too thou?
Bill: Kirsten is going to be there friday night, and if it's like last year friday night is late swim.
Bill: Late swim is 100% worth doing over pajamas.
Bill: If it was *saturday* sure, but not friday.
Aldus (Jess): oh yea late swim is lit but bits not till like 10
Bill: good point...
Bill: nevermind she going to be there saturday too.
Bill: resume 👀 for pajama party.
Bill: Kirsten wants to make the PJ party but doesn't know locations.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Did she just post that?
Aldus (Jess): map of the con center should be on the kalahari site
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEET
Bill: She hasn't been, that's why she didn't.
Bill: She told me in DM, DM'd about the late swim.
Bill: I'm not sure where a PJ party would fit tho...
Bill: I suppose main lobby?
Bill: can always meet there and move too, tbh.
Aldus (Jess): yea i guess main loby or maybe tentacle tree
Bill: Tentacle tree lacks space to setup tho.
Aldus (Jess): hallway next to top of tentacle tree? like on the second floor where the elevatorr are?
Bill: maybe.
Bill: 
Bill: Do I just tell her she'll have 5 people already, or what.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YE!
Afina (Georgia🍀): saturday night?
Bill: I thought about volunteering, but I don't want to lock in my evening to it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill promo the event on my story too
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeeeah
Aldus (Jess): yea i dont wat like any obligations for CCE
Aldus (Jess): not that i ussually have any
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~except da pool, the pool can always have my time~~
Aldus (Jess): YE!
Bill: yeah, late swim is a need.
Bill: and if Saturday doesn't have late swim again, maybe Meg and them are going to close one of de bars like Meg and Lissy did at Next. 👀
Bill: I'd love to chill at the bar.
Aldus (Jess): pool bar? or regular bar? well i think water park closes at 9 so i guess that answers tht
Bill: *we* closing hot tub bars friday night.
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Bill: Kirsten wants to do both nights and I don't want to discourage her but probably not worth it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): tell her she would get better turnout isolating it to saturday night cause friday has late night swim
Aldus (Jess): who is this girl anyway?
Afina (Georgia🍀): you gotta be realistic anyways
Afina (Georgia🍀): shes the neo/ladybug i was hangin with at anext a bit with bill
