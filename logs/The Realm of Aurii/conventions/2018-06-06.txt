Bill: The Chestnut hill sign up sheet seems... small.
lizi: I wish we could go this year but we can't 😢 and I was reading on anexts Facebook all the issues people are having with Sheraton due to some booking error.
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh gosh i heard about that
Bill: ~~Tis why I called earlier~~
Bill: I'd flip a shit man.
Bill: Animenext is such a mess though. Maybe next year Bally's really is the way to go, though Sheraton is being bought by Marriott end of the summer so that might clean up the hotel a bit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ballys is farther too
Afina (Georgia🍀): and the shuttle was pretty shit so i hear
Bill: Everything about Atlantic City is shit.
lizi: Yeaaa I mean. We walked it  cause it's not bad walking through town through the outlet stores. It's the other streets you don't wanna be on XD
lizi: And get a total rewards membership. You get good discounts on rooms and sometimes they're free.
lizi: Or free food credit.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): I'm staying at Bally's this year so I can let you all know how it is
Nokri (Marisa): i got kicked out of caesar's casino on christmas once
their rewards cards used to be really awesome to get people to gamble more (whole weekend stays for free). now we only get free buffet coupons. tho during a con that could save a life
Aldus (Jess): How did you get kicked out of a casino? 😮
Nokri (Marisa): security asked me to leave <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): But lol cuz of Cosplay?
Nokri (Marisa): naw <:lenny:395307171539189760>
you know what a lawbreaking troublemaker i am <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): I hear lots of theft at this year's colossalcon
Aldus (Jess): Yea you sure are. And o really? That's so shitty
Nokri (Marisa): yeah a friend got $60 stolen, stuff going missing in rooms reportedly.
Nokri (Marisa): that seems to be happening a lot though at a lot of different cons. attendees blame the room cleaners but i wonder if it's not actually other room mates
Aldus (Jess): Yea i was wondering that too
Nokri (Marisa): there was one time all my junk was moved so they could make the bed and that freaked me out but everything was still there
Aldus (Jess): Yea alot of people were complaining about that after katsu too
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ooo yeahhh
Bill: <@!228287793099440128> , what's your address?
Dave: 9 eyland place succasunna
Bill: wow, you aren't even a detour.
Bill: Nice.
Dave: When were you going to leave tomorrow
Bill: figuring it out now.
Bill: 2:30, s'long as we leave your place by 3 we're on track for google map's estimate to Georgia's. That conservative for traffic, so we'll see what happens, may be earlier. <@!245270932602486784> and <@!228287793099440128> 
I'm leaving; 2:30
Dave's: 2:50
Leaving Dave(s): 3:00
Georgia's: 5:00 (google maps says 2 hours, but part of that time is traffic based. Whoops if we get there earlier)
AC: between 6:00 and 7:00.
Bill: early badge pickup is 6 to 9 I believe, so we can rock that.
Dave: Roger Roger
Bill: actually might be later to AC.
Bill: closer to 7.
Bill: Hard to estimate traffic on a multi stop trip.
Aldus (Jess): we'll prob leave around 4-ish
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeeet
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll probably just throw on my vault suit with normie everything else tomorrow then
Afina (Georgia🍀): Unless we're gonna get dinner or something in which case I'll just be me lol
Bill: No concrete plans... I'd say either eating after we get badges somewhere or stopping between you and AC.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~McDonald's McDonald's McDonald's~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~bill pulls into drive through, one black coffee~~
Aldus (Jess): im not with you so you can actually do that if you want 😅
Bill: I drink my coffee as sweet as Ruby does though.
Aldus (Jess): ~~the black coffee is for me~~
Bill: yeah, that's about it for plans though? I had the thought visiting the pool thursday night could be relaxing.
Aldus (Jess): POOL
Aldus (Jess): DO IT ~~i probably wouldt be there in time but w/e~~
Aldus (Jess): there also that sailor moon musical thing
Bill: pool closes at 10, you might make it for a bit.
Aldus (Jess): YAAAAY
Aldus (Jess): *skips registration for pool*
Bill: also it's going to be like, 80 tomorrow. Warmer south. I'd skip the fallout suit for that alone.
Aldus (Jess): Shorts and t-shirt for me fam
Bill: ~~no seven jacket~~
Dave: Anyone bringing drinks? If not I can hit up El liquor store before bill picks me up
Bill: I'll be getting a bottle of whiskey later.
Afina (Georgia🍀): For da flask? :V
Bill: mm... Though I'm not going to drink quite as much as at Zenkai.
Bill: Zenkai was a bit of roller coaster.
Aldus (Jess): I'll probs pick up vokda tonight or tomorrow
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wait so yes or no on the microwave
Bill: maybe. There's a request for one. No guarantees.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll being mac and cheese just in case then :3c
Bill: maybe this year we'll do what what we did for Zenkai and pull up in the circle area, check in, get a cart, unload, and I'll ditch the car in the garage after.
Bill: Then we can leave stuff behind.
Bill: @everyone REMINDER that elevator hell is a thing. Sheraton has more elevators that Landcaster, but the point stands. Might be useful to have a carryable bag for sunday, if you want to move the rest of your stuff saturday night or something. Manly relevant for people with bags that cannot be stair carried.
Aldus (Jess): thats a great idea in theory but in practice....
Bill: Really annoying?
Bill: I know.
Bill: All my bags are carryable. :V
Aldus (Jess): so are mine
Aldus (Jess): like i die, but i can carry them if i have too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mine ain't lmaoooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll load up Saturday afternoon/night then
Bill: it's up to you, I don't think Next was really bad getting out last year.
Aldus (Jess): nah i dont recall it being a struggle last year
Bill: Also get cash before getting there if you want some for dealers.
Aldus (Jess): ooo i found a twenty in my wallet yesterday idk where that came from
Aldus (Jess): do i owe you money billy?
Aldus (Jess): like from cpac?
Bill: 5 bucks. I forgot about that.
Aldus (Jess): whooo!
Aldus (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  remember to get dah cash monies
Aldus (Jess): ~~did we pay you for next yet?~~
Bill: Nope.
Aldus (Jess): kay i dont have the paypal login but tom will do laters
Afina (Georgia🍀): Make up brushes washed, got a new set of fake eyelashes that Meg recommended to me, the air mattress sheet is washed and all packed, the first half of Lux paint is dryin
Afina (Georgia🍀): P R O G R E S S
Bill: Meanwhile I’m playing blaz blue.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sewed lux's little thigh armor things
Afina (Georgia🍀): Didn't feel like making them out of foam so I hope no one looks too closely lol
Bill: No need I think.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeah youll be fine
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: i should boot up blaz for a bit today
Aldus (Jess): Ooo I have to wash my make up brushes too 👌
Aldus (Jess): Tank for reminder
Afina (Georgia🍀): I also acquired cereal and Mac and cheese for con
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I'm bringing enough shampoo and condition to share
Nokri (Marisa): Coffee pot Mac and cheese!?
Nokri (Marisa): Genius
Nokri (Marisa): What do you mean everyone isn’t going to be fighting over the single use free hotel shampoo and conditioner
Afina (Georgia🍀): My thicc hair is too much for that shit
Aldus (Jess): Oh really? I won't pack any then it it's ok with you 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye you can use mine
Nokri (Marisa): Ahh the old vanilla pudding in a shampoo bottle trick
Aldus (Jess): Yay
Aldus (Jess): Not yay for vanilla pudding tho
Bill: if matters to you Georgia/Dave, I plan on abusing our 3 person car by having suit on hanger. Hate packing suit jackets.
Bill: So you can as well, within reason.
