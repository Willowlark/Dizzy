Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah security  was literally only 5 mins
Afina (Georgia🍀): We're WAY early
Afina (Georgia🍀): Austin is actually a pretty smol airport
Bill: Check the website then.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> I want a guest for Zenkai, Kira Buckland and 9s’s voice actor.
Nokri (Marisa): Hewwo
It’s a little late for recs so I don’t know if it’s possible for next Zenkaikon but let me check the site and I’ll give ya a link to where they ask for guest recommendations
Also for autographs as jess mentioned, usually they’re free!! At Otakon. Sometimes they’ll sell a special poster or item that fans can get autographed if they didn’t bring their own items and that costs like $20 but it’s limited edition and only available there.
Aldus (Jess): Hnnngggg
Aldus (Jess): Mawisa whip up dat ray cosplay and hop a ona plane
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): omg deuce is recommending labbinak and mangaloo be official guests for zenkaikon what
Nokri (Marisa): anywhere here the link
https://zenkaikon.proboards.com/thread/185/guest-list-2019
Nokri (Marisa): usually autographs are super difficult to get for mega popular guests, and otakon has a very strict policy that you can't start lining up until like one hour before the official autograph time. they'll chase you away if you start lining up early, and they'll kick you out if you arrive after a certain number of people show up, so you have to time it perfectly.

they do sometimes have guests giving autographs in the dealer's hall instead of the official autograph area, and those aren't listed on the schedule. i was one of like 5 people to get a sweet autographed Ballroom poster ~~and horribly embarrass myself by not knowing everything about the anime~~ because I bought a cheap folder at the official booth and buying merchandise got you a free autograph ticket
Nokri (Marisa): if you have nothing else they'll also autograph your con booklet
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> conu?
Elfriede (Tom): i dont have an answer yet
Aldus (Jess): Oh wow that's alot of rules for autograph but I get it, the MM peoples have two times they are doing autographs one on Friday and one on Saturday, I have prints of all the characters I could theoretically bring if I go? Id probably go for Ray's first then seven then v then yoosung
Nokri (Marisa): are they fan-made prints? like artist alley stuff? that wouldn't be allowed 😿  official merch only, or autograph boards
Nokri (Marisa): are they all signing at different times? usually they pair or group up for autographs so being in line for one puts you in line for everyone
Aldus (Jess): Ohhhh whoa! Ok yea they're not official
Aldus (Jess): They are all at the same time
Bill: Alright, if you want to sleep on it do that. I worry about losing the deal, and I need to tell Gord I want off, so let’s do this by lunch tomorrow. That fair?
Nokri (Marisa): oh wow yeah they're all separate!! that sucks!
Aldus (Jess): Oh well guess I'mma have to but dat saeran body pillow
Nokri (Marisa): lol otakon knows they're gonna be so popular
Aldus (Jess): Ye I'd honestly be sacred if I'd even be able to get in the panel
Elfriede (Tom): yeah i suppose so, gotta decide soon anyways, therse not much time
Bill: Such is being impulsive.
Nokri (Marisa): biru how do you feel about cosplay events here that have several hundred cosplayers and just one room like this
Aldus (Jess): PLZ
Nokri (Marisa): it's great right
Nokri (Marisa): it's like the gazebo but with backdrops
Aldus (Jess): I can show you the trainstation with my boss in the pic, just ignore him
Nokri (Marisa): he's a train
Aldus (Jess): Idk if panoramas work on discord 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): EXPERIMENT TIME
Bill: it still a photo.
Aldus (Jess): 
Nokri (Marisa): nice boss
Nokri (Marisa): station looks pretty generic
Bill: ye.
Aldus (Jess): yea i mean its ncie but 🤷
Aldus (Jess): outside would prob beter
Aldus (Jess): nothing special thou
Nokri (Marisa): where i used to live there's an old quaker farmhouse that's fully intact, used for school field trips and whatnot but would be really nice for a historical or nature/magical-esque photoshoot
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): the inside is also exactly 1800s
Aldus (Jess): ooo das nice
Bill: so Magus Bride.
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): thats what i was thinkin
Nokri (Marisa): ~~same but it's not the canon house 😭 BUT CLOSE ENOUGH~~
Aldus (Jess): just slap come ivy on that bitch
Nokri (Marisa): i used to live around the corner from this house. no one bought it because it was such a huge house surrounded by all these other ordinary houses. the closets were bigger than my bedroom and it had a servant's pantry. who did they expect to buy this
Nokri (Marisa): also its backyard was literally a country club
Aldus (Jess): holy butts
Nokri (Marisa): i wonder if there's a church anywhere that'd let people do church photoshoots
Bill: I've thought about it. I bet I could get Abiding Peace to do it, but it's a modern church, none of that classic look.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Jakescribbles told me one big reason a lot of dudes smell is cause they don't actually wipe their butts when they poo
Afina (Georgia🍀): He said he's been in the bathroom and heard guys just _not do it_
Aldus (Jess): WHAT
Ashley (Swolfy): WHAT
Eliran (Halim): WHAT
Elfriede (Tom): WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
Dave: What
Bill: WHAT
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye that's what he told me
Afina (Georgia🍀): We were talking bout con funk
Elfriede (Tom): Ashley said Dan confirms this 😶
Elfriede (Tom): I for one have no experienced such
Bill: Same. I can't imagine it.
