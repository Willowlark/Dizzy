Bill: Think I'll invite Zeikani to chestnut hill. She cosplays RWBY, is a photographer, and seems nice.
Bill: If I didn't unfriend Grey the thought crossed my mind to invite her, but fuck it. That was beating a dead horse.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh yeah that's good we do need more photographers to go around
Afina (Georgia🍀): I could invite Ben 😂
Bill: eeeeeeeeh.
Bill: 😛
Bill: ~~Nobody point out to BNE I'm a huge hypocrite when it comes to self confidence, I demand it of everyone but myself~~
