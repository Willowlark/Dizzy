Afina (Georgia🍀): oh they have multiple signings thats good
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill get A2 friday and 9S saturday
Aldus (Jess): Yea last min planning got me in a tizzy too
Aldus (Jess): Yea I was thinking about maybe getting sevens on Friday and saerans on Saturday since Tom will be cosplaying him but I think it might be same time as RWBY shoot on Friday
Aldus (Jess): ~~i like saerans voice better tho opps~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): what about yoosung
Afina (Georgia🍀): /asks him to do the crying sound
Aldus (Jess): OMG 😂

Afina (Georgia🍀): but thats like not happening
Afina (Georgia🍀): id have to go back to NJ to get my shit to pull that off anyways and thats NOT worth it
Afina (Georgia🍀): i guess i packed only pyrrha stuff and yang stuff specifically to stop myself from changing last minute
Aldus (Jess): Yea I get you
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i am my own worst enemy_
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Dk2PpBZqgX_0f2wTNtyU7Wgqy5pz8L0LNEw48X04As/edit#gid=0
Afina (Georgia🍀): this schedule is so naked its unsettling
Aldus (Jess): Don't worry about a schedule silly
Nokri (Marisa): They sell wigs at ota, some are decent prices
Bill: That’s because you’re just going to be hanging out with us!
Afina (Georgia🍀): r-relaxation!?!??!?! NANI?????
Aldus (Jess): We already back home
Bill: You don’t need a schedule to squad up.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I always need a schedule because
Afina (Georgia🍀): idk
Afina (Georgia🍀): my brain works that way
Nokri (Marisa): You can’t relax at a con there’s too much to do that’s why it’s not called a relax
Aldus (Jess): NVM mm signing are same time as Nier signings
Afina (Georgia🍀): oof
Afina (Georgia🍀): if its an "2 item policy" i can get u thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): if you bring me thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH I WAS WORRIED I DIDNT HAVE ANYTHING FOR THEM TO SIGN BUT I PACKED MY NIER GAME FOR NORTH CAROLINA FUCK YAEH
Aldus (Jess): "excuse I need ALL my sad hacker Bois signitures"
Aldus (Jess): Na I don't have any official merch 😭
Aldus (Jess): I'd have to but something
Nokri (Marisa): I think ota is a one item per person 😭 
They can sign your Otakon book
Nokri (Marisa): Guidebook
Bill: I mean, I made a schedule too. But shoots.
Nokri (Marisa): INWOUNF AN WALL
Nokri (Marisa): INFOUND A Wall WOO
Nokri (Marisa): I can stand in place
Aldus (Jess): Oh wait I can get 9s on Saturday at 5 I think
Aldus (Jess): If I want it
Nokri (Marisa): 9 to 5
Aldus (Jess): Do they have like official prints there you can pay for for them to sign? Like at the table?
Nokri (Marisa): Sometimes, some do, but most don’t I think. MM was saying if you have a card from one of the VIP boxes you’ll get a special print but otherwise they have regular paper I think
Nokri (Marisa): At Otakon most don’t. I used signboards last year
Aldus (Jess): Ooo rip 🤔
Aldus (Jess): What's a sign board?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wait it has to be official merch?
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's a thing?
Nokri (Marisa): Hmm. They won’t sign sketchbooks but maybe you can grab merch from a booth
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah official merch
Nokri (Marisa): A signboard is a square board it’s a japan thing for autographs it’s pretty neat
Aldus (Jess): ~~sign my phone case~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I didnt know about the official merch only rule
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's weird
Nokri (Marisa): Oh the website says they might sign personal items. Japanese guests usually aren’t allowed to by their contract,  I assume cheritz is the same
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): So artist alley stuff is usually a no go
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh okay I don't feel bad for leaving my A2 poster at home the
Aldus (Jess): Yea I was gonna bring my prints if that was allowed
Afina (Georgia🍀): What is "unusual items" lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like "sign my boob" or what
Nokri (Marisa): Rose gets Todd Haberkorn to autograph her Barney VHS tapes. She has a collection of them with Todd in it.
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe stuff like the BNE flag
Aldus (Jess): Ok so I'm going to assume that there is a autograph page in the Otakon book that is blank, i can get them to sign that, then maybe cut the Sigs out and put them in the frame with the print when I get home 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah! There’s usually a blank or two page towards the back just for autographs. They can also autograph their description and picture in the book
Nokri (Marisa): I asked one guest to do that and he drew a mustache on himself because the image was old
Aldus (Jess): Oooo! Ok I might be able to make this work then
Aldus (Jess): Omg that's hilarious
Nokri (Marisa): Uhhh there’s anime blaring over the speakers what happened
Nokri (Marisa): It’s gone now. Soooky.
Aldus (Jess): Well, it's a convention
Aldus (Jess): Haunted anime
Nokri (Marisa): It’s like a GIANT artist alley
Nokri (Marisa): No events just merch and cosplay yehaw
Aldus (Jess): Whoooa
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Ok so rwby shoot 1-2 then one of mm vas at 3 on Friday, then another mm va on Saturday at all, mm panel at 2, and 9s va at 5 <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>  I can aquire all of I plan carefully
Nokri (Marisa): I think they’re turning off the phones?? Or the cell connection??
Aldus (Jess): What?!
Nokri (Marisa): They’re saying something about turning something off and this is your last chance
Nokri (Marisa): Idk
Nokri (Marisa): Yolo?
Aldus (Jess): OMG you're gonna did
Nokri (Marisa): I stood up and fell back down lol I think I’ll stay here
Nokri (Marisa): It’s still on so maybe they were talking about something else
Nokri (Marisa): We goin find out eyy
Nokri (Marisa): Oo a really cute CC just walked by
Nokri (Marisa): Oo they’re kicking me out of this spot rip
Aldus (Jess): Catch her
Aldus (Jess): Oh noes
Nokri (Marisa): Can’t get pics outside the cosplay area and we super far
Aldus (Jess): Oh right 😭
Nokri (Marisa): “The little girl who was lost from her mother has now been found and reunited,” says the speakers
The entire con bursts into applause. So pure.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Worst con morning ever 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): I woke up with cramps, forgot my invisible straps for my corset so now my boobs are just out, my circlet broke, and we're running late
Afina (Georgia🍀): Fuck Otakon
Bill: 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): We're on the way nonetheless tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~even if I already wanna go home~~
Aldus (Jess): Oh jeez 😭
Aldus (Jess): I got foundation on my Nora shirt so we'll just a be hot mess together
Aldus (Jess): I got a pressie for you tho! And I love you!
Afina (Georgia🍀): LOVE YOU TOO JESS 💕
Bill: Aaaaah should have paid for Thursday hotelllll
Bill: Not thatcould have.
Bill: Fuck badges.
Bill: RWBY shoot is behind badge checking people. Ryan says you may be able to sneak by using the stairs and not the escalators. You won’t make it through Prereg beforehand. <@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Is there any way people can smuggle us by with badges and then we meet y'all?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like if you, tom, Jess go in, and Jess comes back with your two badges so me and Hal can get through?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause you're right, there's no time to sit in that line
Aldus (Jess): We don't have badges yet
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh shit so y'all aren't getting in either?
Aldus (Jess): I'm not even banking on making the shoot at this point
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow that's jank
Afina (Georgia🍀): Where's the shoot location?
Bill: Hall E concourse.
Bill: Around the hall from video game room.
Afina (Georgia🍀): If only it was on the stairs like it was last year
Afina (Georgia🍀): Stupid shoot
Aldus (Jess): Plus I have no idea where I'm going 😂
Bill: Stupid shoot planner.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~take it over bill~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Are there people gathering?
Aldus (Jess): I do t think he's there either
Afina (Georgia🍀): DAMN fuck Otakon
Afina (Georgia🍀): Guess JNPR is all there is left 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah Hal and I are missing the shoot cause our hotel room is ready in 15 mins
Eliran (Halim): Its ready now ~
Bill: Shoot was okay. Runner wasn’t bad, just crowded.
Elfriede (Tom): We made it for like the renora shot and that's it
Eliran (Halim): Bra straps bought
Eliran (Halim): Waiting on my starbuck
