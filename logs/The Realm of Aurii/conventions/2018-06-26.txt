Nokri (Marisa): Tanacon not as bad as dashcon but info is still coming out
Afina (Georgia🍀): Kirsten is looking for roomies for Colossal too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why so many people deciding on Colossal east so last minute
Bill: They haven't been yet.
Bill: Meg, definitely taking advantage of a market made up of Gen.
Bill: 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I saw that
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm thinking she's gonna open commissions
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause people have messaged me about leg armor and crickets
Bill: You barely have time for your own stuff, and I’m sure Meg is the same. I have no idea how active cosplayers do commissions.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I did one once
Afina (Georgia🍀): I made a Pidge hoodie
Afina (Georgia🍀): Someone asked ME
Afina (Georgia🍀): I didn't even do commissions
Afina (Georgia🍀): I did it on a whim tho and I made 40 bucks and learned how to sew a Pidge hoodie lol
Aldus (Jess): Whoa
Aldus (Jess): Nice
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I still have extra Pidge fabric lmao is
Afina (Georgia🍀): If anyone is thinking of Pidge-ing any time soon
Afina (Georgia🍀): Plz buy my fabric off me it is soft
Aldus (Jess): Pidge would be my second choice for a voltron cosplay
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lotor is the first? Right?
Aldus (Jess): Yeet
