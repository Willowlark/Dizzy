Nokri (Marisa): heads up if anyone's going that there's going to be a Shakira concert near the convention center in DC the same weekend as Otakon
so super crowded even more than usual
some friends were considering doing a zootopia cosplay group and going to see shakira but otakon is expensive enough as it is
Nokri (Marisa): ~~they should just invite shakira to otakon tbh~~
Bill: <@!288513265661902858> you’re joining Meg’s Franxx group for Katsu? That’s awesome!
Eliran (Halim): Ya
Eliran (Halim): Tbh I'm a bit frustrated that Erik got gorro first
Eliran (Halim): But what can ya do
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ye he'd fit either one of you
Eliran (Halim): It's just the rest of the guys are so much shorter so I feel weird being taller then everybody
