Bill: RIP
Nokri (Marisa): they're furries now
i have some bird whistles that furries use as squeakers tell them they'll need those
Bill: "Swords: @sayuncleqrow" <- Ye fuck Ethan.
Nokri (Marisa): is it normal to list where wigs and stuff were all bought
Aldus (Jess): yea some people do it
Bill: I'd say it's uncommon. Not rare, but not common either.
Aldus (Jess): mine would be like:
Wig: some cheap Chinese shit from amazon
Hammer: A buttload of foam floormats and wood from home depot
Costume: Some more shit from amazon and a jacket made from a pokemon go trainer pattern
Bill: The two reason I see most are 1. so people won't ask you 'where'd you get that wig', and 2. the site is active on instagram so they might get reposted or mentioned or something.
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
wig from chinese ebay
for the costume name each and every type of fabric from the scrap bin at jo-ann's
Aldus (Jess): yea! lmao sept all my fabris is from amazon too
Aldus (Jess): my nora jacket is this really cool stretch demin stuff
Nokri (Marisa): ooo really? i've never bought fabric from amazon i never thought of that. is it usually good? walmart sucks never buy from them.
i might start ordering from aliexpress because the fabric is more... costume quality? kind of? like. i've bought doll fabric from it before and it's a lot more doll-like and cheaper than what jo-anns has. the cotton is stiffer too.
Aldus (Jess): ive only bought that and broadcloth but the broadcloth was same as joanns broadcloth
Bill: Need to signal boost colossal nier via instagram. For the explicit purpose so chibidude sees it.
Bill: oh, and kamistry.
Nokri (Marisa): omg lady whoozica is gonna be at the nier shoot?? really?? can u get her autograph
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: I'll try, but I hear it's hard to do.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah, I mean, just story post that it exists,or regular post
Elfriede (Tom): Either way I'm sure it'll get some attention
Afina (Georgia🍀): :3c I'm on it
Aldus (Jess): thats what he was looking for
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I mean, I was doing it.
Aldus (Jess): yea but thats why u sais it here
Elfriede (Tom): Me and Jess actually prob have a decent chunk of nier followers
Elfriede (Tom): We should prob don't too
Bill: Nope, because I want you and Tom to share it too, since ^
Bill: You hung with everyone, I was taking pictures. Coming from you guys its more friendly.
Aldus (Jess): hmmm okey dokey
Elfriede (Tom): Still not sure if I should do nines or Adam or both 😭 😭 😭
Elfriede (Tom): I wanna be nines to match Jess ofc
Aldus (Jess): custome change half way through photoshoot
Elfriede (Tom): But also Adam cuz he's not done a lot
Bill: You can probably share my story if you want to be lazy, or make your own.
Elfriede (Tom): Mmkay
Bill: Plenty of memeable imagery to make it fun from the shoot gallery.
Bill: ~~Like Tom butt~~
Elfriede (Tom): GLORY TO MANKIND
Bill: yeeee boi
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Aldus (Jess): y your phone red?
Bill: *I was wondering that too*
Elfriede (Tom): Battery saver
Elfriede (Tom): Realized I was at half this morning
Bill: all that pokemon go huh.
Bill: You can't charge it at work?
Elfriede (Tom): I can
Elfriede (Tom): Didn't have the charger
Bill: Here's pre signal boost, lets see if we get more. ~~Probably won't from me sharing it, but you guys...!~~
Bill: Ah, I have a phone dock at work just for wokr.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> do event polls always let you add answers? I'd start the 'who are you cosing' poll but I don't see the option to ensure people can add answers.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think by default it does yeah
Bill: Go check. ~~and someone put down a character so it's not empty~~
Aldus (Jess): theres no option to add anything 😮
Bill: RIP
Aldus (Jess): id say add atleast a few main characters and then add an option should be there
Bill: The option to enable it doesn't show up for some reason.
Bill: I'll just do a google survey.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Did you do it on computer?
Aldus (Jess): i think its just handling it like that cuz the there are no options at all if you have at least 2 then the option should be there
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): I always added RWBY/JNPR and then it gave the option to add more
Bill: Nope, mobile doesn't work any better.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOP yeah I can't add A2 oh no guess I'll have to be 9Breasts
Aldus (Jess): hmm still not there
Aldus (Jess): what the heck
Afina (Georgia🍀): I would just put as many options as possible then
Afina (Georgia🍀): 2B, 9S, A2, Adam, Eve, Uhhh??
Aldus (Jess): devola, polola (sp?)
Aldus (Jess): robots? hehe
Aldus (Jess): emil?
Bill: Or just do spreadsheet?
Aldus (Jess): eh in my experience if people have to take an extra step like click a link its going to get less response
Aldus (Jess): doesnt mean you cant do it
Bill: fuck it, if we miss someone's character they can comment it in.
Aldus (Jess): ye
Bill: ~~Need to make a call list too~~
Bill: My work ethic has *tanked* this week.
Aldus (Jess): ye i feel you
Bill: Done.
