Eliran (Halim): I did a dumb and had fun by driving to and from AC everyday before/after work

Bill: Flora asked what your actual name was Jess, and commented how nice all my friends are. 😊
Aldus (Jess): OH YAY ❤ I was super shy and didnt say hi to her 😭
Bill: Also appreciated waving her over to join us mid formal.
Bill: <@!288513265661902858> do you care if you admin me on BNE? I could add Dizzy to BNE, and give her a !dab command like lewd.
Bill: we can use *all* the dabs.
Bill: moot point, qrow looks good.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 41 fragments of video footage from the con
Afina (Georgia🍀): nicu
Aldus (Jess): DAMN
Afina (Georgia🍀): lets see if i can get it all down to about 8 minutes of footage, its probably more like 20 right about now
Bill: I did not think you recorded that much.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah same nani
Afina (Georgia🍀): im having trouble syncing up a song i like  tho hm hm
Afina (Georgia🍀): theres like a half second between where one video starts, and when i start speaking
Afina (Georgia🍀): and in that second all you hear is tom saying "fighting games"
Afina (Georgia🍀): and ive had to listen to the audio file like 20 times to perfectly edit it out LOL
Bill: you can't suppress fighting games.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Hahahaha omg
Bill: There's two frames of you and Kirstin(?) of the three burst where you blinked, then she blinked.
Bill: Perfectly in sync with my shutter speed.
Afina (Georgia🍀): lmaoooo
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao damn
Afina (Georgia🍀): "ren cancels out emotions so he cant feel like" "why did you stick me with him then!"
Bill: I'm still dying.
Bill: *Hisssss faaaaaccceeeeee*
Afina (Georgia🍀): BILL I LITERALLY JUST SNORTED
Afina (Georgia🍀): It bEGS TO BE MEME'D
Bill: IT'S SOOOOO GREATTTTTT
Afina (Georgia🍀): OMG PLEASE just show them that preview lmao
Bill: he did it at the group shoot, I remember.
Afina (Georgia🍀): also should the "nora stole my mans" go in the main vlog or is that a blooper
Bill: question, what's the difference between bug and panther?
Afina (Georgia🍀): boob window and latex and tail and whip
Afina (Georgia🍀): theres a deliberate sexualization of panther
Afina (Georgia🍀): if you sexualize the bug suit then youre just a hentai ;3c
Bill: Savvy.
Bill: Makes sense.
Afina (Georgia🍀): tru
Bill: well, alright, what I meant is latex versus spandex.
Afina (Georgia🍀): im curbing the chance of being harassed
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh well
Afina (Georgia🍀): like latex they actually use on sex suits
Afina (Georgia🍀): its kinda the same reason id never do fem chat
Bill: So it's what, a stigma thing?
Afina (Georgia🍀): sorta
Afina (Georgia🍀): my mom also follows my insta and i dont think id want my mom seeing that kinda content
Afina (Georgia🍀): which means its probably a good judge of not doing
Afina (Georgia🍀): like my mom doesnt like my pyrrha corset in all honesty but im like LOL I DUN CARE
Bill: Like, I dunno what the difference between the spandex and latex is material wise. Or there not much of a difference, and it's all the Panther sexualizing? (Which I'm all for avoiding, as you recall.)
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i mean latex IS less comfy
Afina (Georgia🍀): but my main reasons for avoiding panther are all to do with the sexual nature of the outfit
Bill: That makes sense ye.
Bill: I was just thinking material wise.
Afina (Georgia🍀): latex is a "sexy fabric" its what bondage suits are made of, and spandex is in like... everything, its not an innately sexy fabric
Bill: Avoid Panther, I hated that part in the game.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean ann hates the suit too
Afina (Georgia🍀): so id be canon
Afina (Georgia🍀): but id be way too uncomfortable cosplaying that kinda thing
Aldus (Jess): Latex is shiny and not forgiving spandex is strechy
Bill: > Girl being pressured into sex with teacher
> Girl threatened with injury to her best friend if not sex the teacher
> Girl *captured in another world by the embodiment of the Teacher's lust*
> Girl fights for her freedom and such in... a catsuit.
Bill: The fucking logic to that decision was one of the worst in things in the game.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeaaaah
Afina (Georgia🍀): meanwhile everyone else gets nice outfits so like eh
Afina (Georgia🍀): oK i still cant tell is "nora stole my mans" blooper or in the actual vlog
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause its funny as fuck
Afina (Georgia🍀): but idk if its too funny for main vlog
Afina (Georgia🍀): _but its also not a blooper_
Bill: Ye, Joker's outfit is fucking swag. I want his coat.
Bill: The vlog is 'your con experience' is it not?
Bill: That's part of the experience. Main blog.
Afina (Georgia🍀): truuu
Bill: Blooper is technical quirks.
Bill: oh yeah, I nowhere near it in collection building, but I'm thinking I'll skip 90% of the rwby shoot Georgia.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: One of these looks like she's getting hugged by her crush, the other seems like she terrified.
Bill: Why.
Bill: Nani.
Bill: 
Bill: Fuck that great.
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> fighting game cosplay meetup at colossal east!
Aldus (Jess): Yea! He's already planning swimsuit Leo for it
Afina (Georgia🍀): i thiiink this vlog is gonna clock in at 8 minutes
Afina (Georgia🍀): nicu
Bill: That was fast. Here’s one way to deal with post con depression.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i just have an audio clip of tom going "brutal"
Afina (Georgia🍀): /yeets it into bloopers
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh no its too smol the music eats it up
Afina (Georgia🍀): well damn bloopers are almost done then
Bill: You should be able to increase the volume of the clip.
Afina (Georgia🍀): but its just "brutal" and then next blooper
Afina (Georgia🍀): the pace is more the problem
Bill: *brutal.*
Afina (Georgia🍀): 7:40-something, not bad
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats a little shorter than most 3 day cons but i barely vlogged saturday
Afina (Georgia🍀): _time to watch for editting errors_
