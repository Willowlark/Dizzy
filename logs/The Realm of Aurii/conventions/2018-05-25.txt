Bill: <@!141729881779077121> (I see you online but I know you mute stuff so you get a mention anyway) when you doing Ryouma? Friday?
Andrew: prob saturday, i was waiting on the photoshoot list for anext
Bill: Even with Overwatch being Friday?
Bill: I assume you're doing that group shoot.
Andrew: I am doing the shoot
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> As you're the only one talking to Ashley, you have to coordinate Star Guardians. Can't do between noon and 2:30.
Bill: <@!350847001937707022> What am I shooting and when are you doing it? You know?
Afina (Georgia🍀): That works cause RWBY is allegedly 12-1 so I'll still be in Yang 😈
Afina (Georgia🍀): Though I'm frustrated waiting for the photoshoot list tbh
Bill: Ah, right, so it'd have to be past 2:30. And yes, I know that's when the shoot is, I'll be there, especially since you went Rwby.
Bill: And you've asked for no shoot times Georgia, you know I like to have set times for photography work.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Friday I'm flexible so I'll work around whatever
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'd like to FINALLY get formal JNPR pics cries
Afina (Georgia🍀): Saturday morning I'll figure it something for Yang
Bill: You realize I have plans formalized yet right.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm sitting in traffic right now so I can figure out for sure when I get home
Afina (Georgia🍀): You do or don't?
Bill: Don’t.
Bill: Figure what you want to photos of first.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _is Anext really in 12 fucking days_
Bill: *yuuuup*
Bill: so help me help you.
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> approximate time frame for switching to Leo?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: pffft no clue
Bill: I need to give you a time frame before that...
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kw5c4uWp7JpJdpLizYgHfNAeiTN5xs2L5-QYSP704uQ/edit#gid=0
Afina (Georgia🍀): okie im building a schedule too and thus far im pretty free
Aldus (Jess): That links to your Zenkai schedule which is apparently trashed
Bill: I got the Next schedule.
Bill: so.
Aldus (Jess): That's weird
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah i cleared the zenkai to use for anext lemme refresh it or somethin
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah it shows right for me lol
Aldus (Jess): Doesn't matter anyway I don't need it lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): TRUE we can figure out shoot times pretty easy
Bill: I mean, you have no schedule asides from your dinner date.
Afina (Georgia🍀): and cosplay changes
Afina (Georgia🍀): but yeah basically lol
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): <@184437198865563648> so I'd say I'd love for you to shoot Ann and/or kofuku. I'll figure out by tonight which day I'll do what. Kofuku is dependent on when my friend wants to do noragami stuff
