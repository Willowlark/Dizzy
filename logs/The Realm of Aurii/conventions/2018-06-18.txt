Nokri (Marisa): let us hope that the rain discourages all my students from coming tonight so i can just sit around and not work for 7 hours 🙏
Nokri (Marisa): but also Dizzy (not desii dizzy but my boss dizzy) said that I can return to my zenkai staff position at any time without re-applying all over again 😭 too pure. Talks are in the works to also potentially tape a livestream of my face onto a dakimakura  so I can be on the lookout for oversized and dangerous props near prop check at the con. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760> <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That's great tho <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): also learned some very interesting intel on the ball for next year. very interesting indeed.
Nokri (Marisa): the wrap-up meeting should be next week finally so if there's room info i'll learn it then
Nokri (Marisa): i can't share the formal ball info until it's announced but semi-related is that they're trying to make it increasingly formal, so attire that seems semi-casual and was allowed in for previous years likely won't be allowed in the future unless it follows the attire guidelines
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah it was pretty damn formal this year so <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): orly? then maybe they already made the dress code change and i misunderstood. or they gonna get stricter. that was the #1 complaint in the past tho, not formal enough
Bill: Tanks for the spoilers. Everyone promises not to leak stuff.
Bill: Con people, don't forget to watch for Next room block announcements as well.
Bill: Everyone isn’t free June 14th, for some reason your coming to my parents anniversary. Or any other excuse to not go with 30 miles of Snow.
Afina (Georgia🍀): whaaats going on then
Bill: Snows birthday. She invited BNE.
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh i dont see that in chat
Afina (Georgia🍀): oops i work anyways lol
