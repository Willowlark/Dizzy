Bill: Since Andrew asked, there’s not supposed to be a refrigerator in the sheraton. It’s dumb.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Microwave?
Bill: Also no. So the Sheraton has deluxe and regular rooms, in interest of cost I booked regular. You can guess what’s in the deluxe. That said, they have standalone microwaves and refrigerators they can provide, I put it in a request. Much like connecting rooms, a first come first serve thing.
Aldus (Jess): That's goings to take up precious floor space
Bill: That is true.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: lmao Sheraton is such a rip off as usual
Bill: Yeeeeaaaaah but it’s close.
