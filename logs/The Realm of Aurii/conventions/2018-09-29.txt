Nokri (Marisa): Was katsuâ€™s ball changed to Saturday? ðŸ¤” if so why they do that
Bill: Ye. It wasn't a popular choice.
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah thatâ€™s so strange. Is it before the masquerade? Or after the masq? Itâ€™d have to be after right unless they split cosplay into two departments. Or is it in a different room than main events
Bill: Main events is connected to the balcony with da gazebo?
Nokri (Marisa): Naw itâ€™s upstairs from registration, one floor above the gazebo level I believe
Nokri (Marisa): Unless they moved that too
Nokri (Marisa): Did they actually use the ballroom for the ball for once
Bill: Nah. It was same floor as reg.
Nokri (Marisa): ðŸ¤” wot
Nokri (Marisa): Is reg still in that big room that kinda looks like a garage
Nokri (Marisa): Next to the exhibition hall?
Bill: think so. Farthest room on the left after going into con area.
Nokri (Marisa): I asked for a pic from some ouran gun club cosplayers there once and they immediately went into a bdsm pose.
