Bill: <@!288513265661902858> I’m going to start putting together CCE info, can you let me know what you’re doing?
Nokri (Marisa): oh nooo. oh no. whoever is running otakon's tumblr page might not know what they're doing. this could be an issue and it's so easy to change if they just e-mail registration.
Nokri (Marisa): otakon has a reverse escape room ooo
Aldus (Jess): Like they trap you?
Nokri (Marisa): naw you gotta break into the room
Aldus (Jess): Oh neat
Bill: Aww, I feel popular. Ryan wants me to do team SSSN on Friday, Meg wants me to shoot (I was going to message her anyway, since we didn’t actually shoot Next and she had asked), and aquacosplay.
Aldus (Jess): nicu!
Bill: Whaha.
Bill: *Also*

Bill: ~~I’ll speed if I have to~~
Aldus (Jess): theres a rave on sunday?
Aldus (Jess): or rwby?
Aldus (Jess): i confuse
Bill: Sorry, race Friday Saturday
Aldus (Jess): ooo ok
Aldus (Jess): that makes more sence
Bill: Rave
Bill: We were talking getting there between 11 and 12. If we leave by 6 that should be the timeframe.
Aldus (Jess): yea barring any problems not sure if tom and i are wearing cosplay down or just changing when we get checked in
Aldus (Jess): which would mean no costumes for shoot 🤔
Bill: Let’s look at timing again in a bit, getting lunch.
Eliran (Halim): I think I'll ozpin at Ota
Eliran (Halim): Dont really got any groups or match ups so why not an oldy
Bill: Got a suit, you can be Jumin Han probably.
Aldus (Jess): LOL
Afina (Georgia🍀): get ready to SWEAT then
Eliran (Halim): Wait what is everyone's plans for ota
Eliran (Halim): ~~also bae there are so many friends at OTA now it might be worth staying longerrrr~~
Eliran (Halim): Assuming we can figure out a potential room plan
Aldus (Jess): lol there was no plan 2 days ago, but uhhh for now Nora, Mystic Messenger MC, and idk sunday yet
Eliran (Halim): ~~does that mean if we show up at all Friday jnpr can happen~~
Aldus (Jess): ye
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~fuck fuck fuck fuck~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~you said the summoning word fuck fuck fuck~~
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: if we leave at 6am, worst case is 11am arrival. We'd easily make RWBY shoot.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _this is so last minute its murdering me_
Afina (Georgia🍀): bae does that mean were going friday now too
Bill: Don't stress it. Not like we're stopping cons after CCE.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i just hate last minute things
Afina (Georgia🍀): i get it from my mom oof
Aldus (Jess): yea im having a stage 10 freak out as well
Bill: I know. 😛 So don't kill yourself.
Aldus (Jess): less now but monday i was a wreck
Eliran (Halim): I'll ask my parents about it later 
Also if we go Friday we should figure out our explicit idea plan for where we stay that night
Elfriede (Tom): Idk what I'm doing sun, maybe nothing
Elfriede (Tom): But for now the plan is Ren and unknown
Bill: aaand my new camera strap system be here.
Bill: perfect.
Bill: So now that Georgia and Mangoloo are tight, and we’re bringing Georgia to CCE, is mangoloo going to be around us?
Bill: *snrk*
Bill: Watch she remembers me as the guy who asked if she knew Georgia.
Bill: Mood: Not needing a fucking suit for a con.
Aldus (Jess): Oh yea das good
Bill: bigger Mood: not needing *dress shoes*
Bill: <@!228287793099440128> Bring your air mattress just in case. <@!351471675843411978> I *can* throw the d3300 into a different camera bag, if you'd like.
Bill: There's a Nier shoot, 3pm on Friday.
Afina (Georgia🍀): *shakes fist angrily that im missing rwby AND nier*
Bill: Most Nier shoots I've heard about were crap so...
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~i just wanna see all the beautiful beautiful billiam~~
Bill: ~~if no one shows up to Nier there's no one to see~~
Bill: But RWBY.
Afina (Georgia🍀): goes friday, wears weiss, pops off ponytail and puts on dirt for nier shoot
Bill: There's a *blazblue* shoot.
Bill: You could Weiss to that lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): wheres the shoot list?
Bill: https://hiroko.otakon.com/events_schedule.asp
Bill: and Noragami, dang.
Bill: ~~why the fuck doesn't RWBY have two shoots~~
Bill: ~~fuckers~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): and miraculous ladybug
Afina (Georgia🍀): fuck
Bill: More importantly, who didn't setup a Mystic Messenger shoot when half the cast is there?
Bill: Fools,
Bill: ooooh, some one setup a second persona shoot, IE, likely not the same guy who always runs them.
Bill: Nice.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah theres persona and then persona 5
Afina (Georgia🍀): why is everything i care about on friday cries
Aldus (Jess): RIGHT that's what I said!
Bill: ~~you're going friday~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): and theres no single day badges
Bill: oh, about the MM shoot.
Aldus (Jess): Ye

Bill: Do it.
Aldus (Jess): Lmfao I don't even know the layout of the convention center
Bill: I do?
Bill: Georgia does?
Aldus (Jess): Well just pull a 2b squared
Aldus (Jess): I've got enough to worry about
Bill: "Pull a 2b^2"
Bill: I love it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~no league of legends shoot but a homestuck shoot? what the fuck~~
Elfriede (Tom): lmao wtf
Bill: ~~are you *really* surprised, you were the homestuck queen~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): its 2018 let homestuck die
Afina (Georgia🍀): both games were circa 2009 if im not mistaken
Afina (Georgia🍀): and league has a way bigger following than homestuck has left lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): I SAW A HOMESTUCK AT RTX THO
Bill: ~~and you knew them~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): n o
Afina (Georgia🍀): they were a god tier dave
Afina (Georgia🍀): there was also a star guardian lux there
Bill: That means nothing to me.
Bill: Unless you meant Dave Dave.
Afina (Georgia🍀): they werent gray lol
Elfriede (Tom): yeah league is 2008
Elfriede (Tom): oops
Elfriede (Tom): meant 2009
Elfriede (Tom): the concepts for some of the OG characters were released in 2008
Elfriede (Tom): like BLITZCRANK
Afina (Georgia🍀): UGH THAT BITCH
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i think homestuck started 2008
Afina (Georgia🍀): whenever obama was president first (homestuck ran the whole time of obamas presidency)
Bill: With bug though...
Bill: It's a hard series to do a group shoot for.
Bill: We learned that.
Bill: Cause everyone cosplays bug and chat.
Afina (Georgia🍀): you noticed tat at anext too yeah
Bill: ~~I also took over the shoot, yes~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): bill and i are the bonnie and clyde of photoshoots
Afina (Georgia🍀): we drive in guns blazing and kick the door down and take it over
Bill: 👈  😎 👉
Bill: I'm shooting Ryan's SSSN group yeeeet
Afina (Georgia🍀): _spots are going fast_
Afina (Georgia🍀): billiam i think im doing yang but idk plz save room for your biggest fan 🙏
Bill: Meg, Lissy, Aquacosplay, and Ryan.
Bill: Plus Jess and Tom, and you.
Bill: Since it's fairly chill Friday, we'll do whatever you decide friday sometime in the mid afternoon Jess? ~~Make it Renora and we do spicy weekend~~
Aldus (Jess): Well prob do renora Friday I think
Bill: I can't decide if I want to do MM panel with you two.
Aldus (Jess): Like 90% not sure if Tom is coming with me or not
Bill: It's like, 3 hours of the con but I can make 'you hate V' jokes the whole time.
Aldus (Jess): Nevermind you're not invited
Bill: *Shouts to whole line*
"This person hates V"
Bill: Georgia, when you getting to con?
Afina (Georgia🍀): gooood question
Afina (Georgia🍀): i would ask hal but hes napping
Afina (Georgia🍀): friday is looking so tempting now but thats 100 dollas sobs
Afina (Georgia🍀): i wish they had one day badges
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~maybe ill just lobbycon~~
Bill: Lissy is.
Bill: But ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: well, also try and get his CCE plans from him.
Aldus (Jess): If your only comming Saturday then it's 70 I think? But 100 if Friday too
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah all the events i want are friday
Afina (Georgia🍀): like literally all of them
Aldus (Jess): Rwby and Nier shoots? Or are there more?
Afina (Georgia🍀): miraculous ladybug also
Aldus (Jess): Oooo wow
Afina (Georgia🍀): like 100 is such a steep price to pay after sinking so much into rtx, and i dont wanna do anything at con besides see people and take photos
Afina (Georgia🍀): but also im really against lobbyconning so it would be hypocritical
Aldus (Jess): Yeeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): SIGH ill talk to him about it tonight
Afina (Georgia🍀): he has a dinner too so he'll be home around 10
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: 100 as opposed to 70?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i meannnn
Afina (Georgia🍀): BLUH fuck otakon for such high prices its not worth it
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill probably just lobbycon no matter what
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe hal and i will go just friday
Afina (Georgia🍀): who knows
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~this plan was so last minute im mostly just angry at it now~~
Bill: Then don’t do it?
Aldus (Jess): Awww yea I understand
Afina (Georgia🍀): i wanna see people and hal wants to go
Bill: You’ll see us soon enough, you saw everyone at RTX...
Bill: If it’s going to stress you don’t do it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): id just feel better if this was a concrete plan made way in advance
Bill: So would I. I book everything first day it’s available. But seeing all the con life at RTX, knowing we could get a room nearby for a good price, and being Disposable Income Squad, we can afford to be impulsive.
Aldus (Jess): ~~and it was stressed af~~
Bill: I’ve also been on and off considering it for a month now. Booking is old hat to me, parking fell into our lap...
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill see when hal wakes up
Afina (Georgia🍀): i need to bounce what the heck we're doing off of him
Bill: But, that’s me. You need more to be comfortable. Don’t stress yourself trying to match what we’re doing.
Bill: You’re already leaving for vacation the day after, I’m surprised you said you’d do Saturday to begin with.
Afina (Georgia🍀): eh
Afina (Georgia🍀): the problem is that i budgeted RTX with the intention of not needing to spend money afterwards
Afina (Georgia🍀): which is really the only barrier to Otakon for me
Bill: Aaaah.
Bill: Fair.
Afina (Georgia🍀): otherwise im pretty rested from RTX and emotionally ready to commit to con and cosplay
Afina (Georgia🍀): but i dont like that our plans are up in the air, nor the fact that its looking like ill have to put out more bucks than i wanted to
Bill: You always want to con and cosplay. 😛
Afina (Georgia🍀): false, tuesday i didnt want any more cosplay lol
Bill: Sorry kid, you and Hal are on your own plan wise.
Bill: Can’t do the thing where I do all the stuff this time.
Afina (Georgia🍀): correct
Afina (Georgia🍀): and hes busy til 10
Afina (Georgia🍀): which leaves me stirring with his uncertainty for at least 3 hours ugH
Bill: Play Nier lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): why cant i be actually cosplay famous so moneys never an issue
Bill: Wait till you have a stem career job. You’ll be in disposable income squad.
Bill: 50 bucks on patreon a month is chump change.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _god what a life that would be_
Bill: Or if you end up at Thor... they seem to pay well enough.
Bill: That’d be sooner.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah
Bill: (Dunno if NASA internship would pay)
Afina (Georgia🍀): 5k-6k for one summer
Afina (Georgia🍀): as far as research goes
Afina (Georgia🍀): and yeah idk ive gotten more somber about money in the two weeks that this divorce thing has been announced
Afina (Georgia🍀): like my mom was upfront to me yesterday that we dont have the money to stay in this house more than a year or two more
Afina (Georgia🍀): with two being the maximum
Afina (Georgia🍀): and she said we're gonna have to be more frugal now that my dads not contributing to the bills at all
Afina (Georgia🍀): and its like U G H adult problems go away i am only an adult in training
Aldus (Jess): 😦
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean luckily we're not scraping by
Afina (Georgia🍀): and the house is valued at 1 million dollars so
Afina (Georgia🍀): selling it nets us a big chunk of change
Bill: Hugs kiddo.
Afina (Georgia🍀): lol thanks
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean luckily it looks like that guy is gonna bite on the commission
Afina (Georgia🍀): i officially quoted him 500 today for materials, labor, and shipping and hes gonna get back to me
Afina (Georgia🍀): and ill try to put more hours into youtube and hopefully monetize that
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~goes into boudoir to pay mortgage~~ jkjk
Bill: You’ll be dead.
Bill: Commission is good, and opening up to more will probably be more successful than YouTube.
Afina (Georgia🍀): probably
Afina (Georgia🍀): its just never guaranteed side money
Bill: That’s just time.
Bill: True.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yuuuup
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean thankfully im good at making pyrrha after all this time, which is also a rare skill
Afina (Georgia🍀): so hopefully that can net me SOME stuff
Bill: At 500 a pop, yeah.
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats without leg armor too
Afina (Georgia🍀): so im optimistic
Afina (Georgia🍀): its just hard being confronted with adult problems and stuff
Aldus (Jess): I'm sorry things are so confusing right now. I understand what you feel like regarding the money thing. It's really hard to plan with things like that going on
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i mean at least i know im coming to terms with the whole divorce thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): my dad hasnt left yet, and it mostly doesnt bother me
Bill: It is hard. Fucking sucks. But you’ll make it through Georgia. You have all of us, and more importantly, you’re a strong girl. I have faith in you.
Bill: 💙
Afina (Georgia🍀): thanks guys 💞
Bill: You need anything we’re here.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah 👆
Afina (Georgia🍀): ❤
