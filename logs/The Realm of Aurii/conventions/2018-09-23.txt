Nokri (Marisa): This guy I met today at Tokyo Game Show and I are friends now and he’s going to Katsucon because he lives in Maryland and I was like “EYYY SEE U AT KATSU” <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
Also he’s a literal giant and I feel like I’ve seen him at cons before. He had a circle of Japanese guys around him and when he flexed they all went “sugoooooi!!”
Aldus (Jess): Omg that's amazing
Elfriede (Tom): Oh wow
Elfriede (Tom): 💪 💪 💪 💪 💪 💪
Nokri (Marisa): The girl I was with was looking for him because they were friends. We kept walking in circles and she didn’t know what he was cosplaying. I assumed she was searching for a shirt girl because that’s 99% of cosplayers and it’d be understandably difficult to find one in particular. Nope she was looking for the 7’ tall bodybuilder. Ok.
Elfriede (Tom): Hahaha that's great tho
Elfriede (Tom): Do you know his handle
Elfriede (Tom): His skin tone reminds me of kamistry lmao
Nokri (Marisa): Ya he’s @whodigiya on twitter
Elfriede (Tom): Oof twitter
Elfriede (Tom): Not worth
Elfriede (Tom): Oo and insta too
Elfriede (Tom): Oo he cosplays all fighting game characters I've seen this guy
Nokri (Marisa): O ya u right that’s his insta
Twitter is huge in japan. That’s the first thing anyone asks for at a con. Instagram seems more hipstery

Elfriede (Tom): Lmao
Nokri (Marisa): the shorts. pulling. it. off.
Bill: As much as twitter confuses me, it’s probably a better platform overall than Instagram.
Bill: Oh my god I scrolled back to copy pasta a crazy marisa story for BNE. I found one, but it’s just normal marisa.
