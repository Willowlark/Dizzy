Bill: Seriously jealous of fucking Hunter. He may shop a good amount, but his composition is good and inspired and he has tools for to compensate for poor light, he’s pushy about shoots *but that some how doesn’t get met with no’s*, has apparently half a dozen people from BNE in shoot plans with him, all the time in the world (apparently?), and he’s got a more conventional popular style so everyone will like him more for photos, especially if it’s free. ~~They’ll probably like him more too because the fact that I do free photos has to have formed at least a few of the friendships i have in BNE; I’m not that likable.~~ 

So. React salt or whatever but I’m venting.
Elfriede (Tom): That's only because Hunter is really excited, plus he's planning it with all the "last minute spur of the moment people who have time on thier hands."
Afina (Georgia): Meg: takes only two classes
Afina (Georgia): Casey: doesn’t go to work or school
Afina (Georgia): Hal: Poli sci major taking only 4 classes
Afina (Georgia): Hunter is LITERALLY asking all the people that are most available
Bill: I’m not looking to be logical, I’m *venting*.
Bill: Just because I have reason not to be jealous doesn’t mean I won’t be.
