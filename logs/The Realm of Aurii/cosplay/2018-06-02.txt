Dave: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That day Tomukuncosplay realize he couldn't beat the women cosplayers
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: So he became them
Bill: Pfft, wasn’t Poppy planned as of last month?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Star gaurdian ye, I've wanted to do poppy for a while
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But blue skin
Dave: *wonders if he should test out the full cosplay like tom*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: HMMMM
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Cept yours is here
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Your gonna have to throw it in your car before thursday
Afina (Georgia🍀): hmmmmm i should pack soon
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ...for....for next?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: you pack pretty early riggght
Bill: *remember civvies this time*
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~no civilian clothes we clothe like warriors~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i usually pack like two weeks ahead
Bill: ~~remember friggin pajamas, modesty be damned I ain't sleeping in my jeans again~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): just made things easier for me and bough lux's socks
Afina (Georgia🍀): i dont wanna make my own socks lol
Bill: Nicu.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 👌
Eliran (Halim): Guess who's cosplays have yet to arrive 🙃
Bill: Eeeeeh?
Bill: Thought you ordered like a month ago?
Afina (Georgia🍀): no shipping updates either bae?
Eliran (Halim): Gotta double check my email but I don't think so
Eliran (Halim): I think last I checked everything should be on the way
Afina (Georgia🍀): anyone else looking in BNE 👀
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeee..
Afina (Georgia🍀): what the heck
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I... Don't even know man
Afina (Georgia🍀): i wish i could hear about her from another source goddamn
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Exactly
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like aight... This girl bullying snow is clearly immature as hell
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But the *why* snow is what's got me
Afina (Georgia🍀): me too!
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i did a photoshoot with that girl messaging her last year, she wasnt malignant or anything
Afina (Georgia🍀): and shes friends with people Meg is friends with, and i trust Megs judgement of friends
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like why some *wheelchair girl* 

I think snow is leaving a lot of previous bad blood out
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like she probably really got into it at some point with morning mist and fought with her, then played the victim and did the woe is me thing
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Then switched friend groups but morning most is still mad
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But I doubt snow is completely innocent
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh yeah so do i
Afina (Georgia🍀): theres no way shes 100% the victim
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: We've already caught her playing the victim AND lying, so its... Rough
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *and the reason I don't think she needs a wheelchair and uses one to make people feel bad for her*
Bill: This is getting way too middle school for me though. I don't want to be involved on any side.
Bill: I get an off vibe from Mist too, after following her for awhile.
Bill: I don't particularly like either of them, and I trust my gut.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean its possible she has a problem like weak ankles or something; she may need it for long distances. though it IS weird she didnt have one at all at zenkai
Afina (Georgia🍀): (then again it costs money to rent a wheelchair so she may be skimping on costs and forcing herself to power through, who knows)
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i dont really care for either of them but i know the value in playing nice
Bill: Or she had a recent operation around Katsu and has recovered.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah I can't say for certain anything
Afina (Georgia🍀): im just here to dress up and take pictures, thats it 😤
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Just that she *still* gives me... The **Vibes**
Bill: Exactly, we do pleasantries with Snow, I don't plan on meeting Mist anytime soon, and stay the fuck out of their nonsense.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Mist was there after the katau formal... WITH snow if I remember correctly
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Unless she was just following her
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Blehhh I don't like the whole thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah its messy
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Legit sounds like highschool like...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like freshman level
Aldus (Jess): I'm lurking only today
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i dont like that my name was dropped_
Afina (Georgia🍀): _by either side_
Afina (Georgia🍀): if anyone messages me ill just say im not informed enough to be involved so i elect to stay out of it
Afina (Georgia🍀): though no one has messaged me directly
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: YEP I thought the same
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *My new best friend georgia will beat you up*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: When you aren't involved at all
Bill: oh ffs. I missed that part.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ugghhhhh this whole thing is so immature, both sidesssss
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Just fucking block her and don't talk to them, it's so simple
Bill: This is *going* to come to a head at RTX, not too late to baiiiil...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: The name dropping is like.. kid stuff, like "I know this cool popular person so you can't tell me what to do"
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~im cool?~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~yeah i guess if im running the rtx shoot i must be cool~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): but yeah its hella immature
Afina (Georgia🍀): which is SO WEIRD cause i literally took photos with that girl and she was nothing but nice
Afina (Georgia🍀): and shes mutual friends with people Meg is really good friends with
Bill: and mangaloo is nothing but nice.
Bill: in the sense her public persona isn't her whole person.
Afina (Georgia🍀): from what rtx people said last year, mangaloo is nice, but very shy and quiet in actuality
Afina (Georgia🍀): i feel like she chooses to be friends with mist out of good judgement?
Bill: If Casey's ruby personality was her actual personality, I wouldn't follow her. I support the (apparent) quiet girl. Not ms insta famous.
Bill: I don't know, I don't know Casey and I don't know Mist. Which in a nutshell, means avoid this drama as fast as possible.
Afina (Georgia🍀): true facts
Bill: The only reason I'm not going to forget about it entirely is you getting dragged in.
Bill: Dealing with ~~Ethan's~~ Snow's Drama: Electric Boogaloo.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah im gonna be wary
Afina (Georgia🍀): hmmmm mist and mangaloo have been nothing but nice to me in the couple interactions with them
Afina (Georgia🍀): if anything id be more suspicious of snow tbh
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause right off the bat she sucked me into the drama
Afina (Georgia🍀): huh
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: :Elfriede_Sigh:
Afina (Georgia🍀): elfriede sigh is the perfect mood for such a situation lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~actually i dont think elfriedes sighed in a while~~
Bill: Oh yeah, I don’t think Snow is innocent. Nor will I claim Mist and Casey are instigators.
Bill: But since you don’t really know Most and Casey, stay out of it until you’ve got all the information verified with your own eyes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _all i can trust at RTX is Hal_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~Elfriede sighed last post~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~Nah ya know what, I'll message both mist and and snow and just start bullying both of them~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): the return of the _sighs_
Afina (Georgia🍀): TOMUKUN NO YOULL LOSE YOUR COOL STATUS
Afina (Georgia🍀): not the funny tho, still funny even as a bully
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Probably Gen and Chris too. Stick with them.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH TRUE
Afina (Georgia🍀): speaking of gen, i havent seen her start pyrrha yet
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPR904NdUgri07SxxUB8UdrAjihn_YSebvBo5F-yDcU/edit#gid=0
Afina (Georgia🍀): look at this color coordinated pack list
Afina (Georgia🍀): how KAWAII
Bill: Oh yeah, she plans on doing it in like a month or two. I didn't have the heart to tell her she'll never manage it.
Eliran (Halim): Wtf why does shit always happen when I'm working
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause you work in prime Drama Time™
Eliran (Halim): Ugh 
It's all so petty 
I personally trust mist over snow but god this is stupid af
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bae RTX is a warzone youre the only one i can trust
Eliran (Halim): Bae I can and will tell people to duck off just so you know
Eliran (Halim): If problems arise at the shoot I will try to peacefully resolve them for you
Afina (Georgia🍀): dis why youre a good boi
Afina (Georgia🍀): also yes gen and chris are definitely trustworthy
Afina (Georgia🍀): most of the rtx room is actually?
Eliran (Halim): Yeah they aren't drama mongers
Eliran (Halim): Ugh
Eliran (Halim): I feel like BNE is bashing and I don't like ittttt
Eliran (Halim): I want to comment but my breaks ending and I really shouldnttt
Afina (Georgia🍀): leanna and erik took neutral approaches
Eliran (Halim): Yeah I know but Heather, Jamie, Monica aren't
And I feel like mark wants to deal with it papa style 
I'll see where this is at later and decide if I need to comment later
Eliran (Halim): Ok, break over TTYL
Afina (Georgia🍀): bye bae ❤
Bill: BNE is bashing, because Snow has turned herself into the group victim. I see no way to go about calling that out without more drama. This is going to start driving BNE apart too.
Bill: We’re not close to everyone in BNE, it’s not a close group of friends. We can’t treat it as such.
Bill: *whoop Jaime did a passive aggressive story post*
Bill: Gen is shooting with LTD on location noooo das sketchhhh
Afina (Georgia🍀): DAMN I WAS ABOUT TO MESSAGE THAT
Afina (Georgia🍀): hopefully shes taking someone with her
Afina (Georgia🍀): i feel like shes rational enough to do so
Afina (Georgia🍀): he wasnt a creepy dude just awkward so
Afina (Georgia🍀): PRAYS 4 GEN
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 🙏 🙏 🙏
Afina (Georgia🍀): also im glad she looks like shes breaking out nora again? and rob didnt ruin renora for her
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah that sucks when people do couple cosplays only to never touch them again
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like Rebecca's holo
Afina (Georgia🍀): _no one could ever ruin arkos for me_
Bill: I warned Gen about LTD at Zenkai.
Bill: Just that he gives me bad vibes.
Bill: She said she knew what she was doing, so.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i trust her
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah Gen is smart
Bill: You don’t have to worry about anyone ruining Arkos, you already got it. XD
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I feel like she'd stab a bitch if she had to
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~oh no i have to wife helium~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh gen totally would
Bill: Tom you already got Jess to cos waifu CC, when you getting her to be Holo? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: GOOD POINT
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Although Holo isn't as high on my waifu list, I feel like she should be considering she had a way better personality
Bill: see posted a driving selfie, and wasn’t driving. Probably has Chris with her. Whew.
Bill: ~~But do you need some many transit selfies~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): that has got to be the longest caption ive ever written hoo boy
Bill: 
Bill: Aww.
Aldus (Jess): #relatable
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Relatable
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHEEZES nathaniel apparently recruited angryjigglypuff, the blake that was talking snow, on the rwby private photoshoot for RTX
Afina (Georgia🍀): which is essentially a lot of the fan faves of rwby cosplay
Afina (Georgia🍀): _shes the blake_
Bill: *RTX is going to be a shitshow*
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): boom as soon as she joins the chat
Afina (Georgia🍀): interesting owo
Bill: *Just stay outta it.*
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i am
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Bill: Trying to think of a way you can say you like to stay out of things politely.
Bill: Ey, you did that.
Bill: Excellent.
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> conflict avoiding woo
Bill: *drama* avoiding. That’s different.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wise Rice will have none of this drama
Bill: *thats wez*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *they dont call me Dumb Rice*
Aldus (Jess): You know
Aldus (Jess): In middle school I had to take a class called conflict resolution
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: oh nice
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: thats usful
Aldus (Jess): I got an A+
Afina (Georgia🍀): THEY DONT CALL ME DUMB RICE

Aldus (Jess): I think it's the vault suit mixed with one of the 50s style dresses you can wear in the game
Bill: Yeah, guess it’s an original mash up.
Aldus (Jess): Ye
Afina (Georgia🍀): Boom 30 mins Yona wig styled woo

Bill: Flashback to 2017 Tom: “I’ll cosplay, but I never want to crunch for a cosplay”
Afina (Georgia🍀): huehue
