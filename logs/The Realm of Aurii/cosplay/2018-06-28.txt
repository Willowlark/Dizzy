Nokri (Marisa): i was looking for a picture of BoJo in homestuck cosplay but found this instead and honestly this is a Mood™
Elfriede (Tom): Omaiwamoushindeiru
Nokri (Marisa): It was 100 degrees when I wore that <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> true
Nokri (Marisa): I want to cosplay Trizza just to recreate this selfie
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): What’s a good place we can set on fire
Aldus (Jess): ~~my work~~
Aldus (Jess): I mean they'll just move somewhere else but it'll get me a vacation
Nokri (Marisa): Cosplay at Jess’s work lets do it
Nokri (Marisa): I have the double sided trident I’d just have to stick a pink gem on it
Bill: team rwby is turning out to be one of the most popular I've posted.
Bill: Hasn't beaten Ryan half naked or electromagnetism. But over 100.
Aldus (Jess): OO gotta post
Aldus (Jess): whoooo! 2 posts in a row reached 100 likes within 2 days of posting
Bill: Amazing <@&455787357426417674>
Aldus (Jess): F U
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: I'm... sorry your famous?
Aldus (Jess): 100 likes isnt famous 😮
Aldus (Jess): its ok cuz 707 is todays posting plan which means ill get like 60 cuz no tit
Afina (Georgia🍀): Between Zenkai Team RWBY, Schnee Shoot, and Grey Towers Weiss, I think I have enough Weiss pics to last me a while 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): Stocking up on dem pics before school hits yeeeet
Bill: I've got some bad news for your color palette though.
Bill: A2 is a white and black shtick.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah the white will be just like Weiss but I think the black will break it up
Afina (Georgia🍀): Not to mention, buying an A2 outfit would be that stretch latex shit which reflects light
Afina (Georgia🍀): But using the stretch suede should absorb it more
Afina (Georgia🍀): Making the black more black
Bill: Ye, you making it right?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think so
Afina (Georgia🍀): Someone else I saw their progress and really liked it
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's a black stretch suede more likely than not
Afina (Georgia🍀): And as much as A2 has the _sexy midriff_ id probably cut a little lower
Bill: going to make the torso separate from the top, like in canon?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yup
Afina (Georgia🍀): And if swimsuit Nier is happening for CCE and I hop in on that, I would probably do a bikini top and then black swimsuit shorts
Afina (Georgia🍀): Not board shorts tho, shorter than those
Bill: Hot pants, basically.
Afina (Georgia🍀): And maybe I can get the black of the legs on a pair of tights?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or maybe a one piece bathing suit Idk
Bill: Pretty sure the black on her legs is tattered leggings.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably
Bill: I thought I had artbook scans...
Bill: hmm.
Bill: nah.
Bill: A2's base is still skin tone though, she just has the lines to make it look like plates placed on her.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which I'd wanna do
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ideally, for swimsuit A2, id wanna get a swimsuit like this
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): And have the full body dance tights on, with the plate lines painted on the tights
Afina (Georgia🍀): (So I can still swim and not worry about make up coming off
Afina (Georgia🍀): And have the plate lines showing
Aldus (Jess): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): :Oc
Afina (Georgia🍀): No open sides tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean I guess that is sorta ambitious
Aldus (Jess): You could edit it
Bill: lol, gotta have some midriff apparently.
Bill: just not *sex* midriff.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ITS A SWIMSUIT it different
Aldus (Jess): Or a tankini with hot pants and add her details on the bottom
Afina (Georgia🍀): The only problem is that tights have a seam up the middle
Afina (Georgia🍀): So id wanna hide that
Bill: You could still do the destroyed leggings part of the main outfit for the swimsuit right?
Aldus (Jess): Be careful with that the floors in the water park are grippy cement they tear tights apart
Aldus (Jess): The same floors are in all the pools and hot tubs
Aldus (Jess): Basically whatever you wear will be one time use
Aldus (Jess): Unless it's really durable like if you put the shoe bottom thingy in like you have for ladybug
Aldus (Jess): But regualt tights or leggings are gonna get destroyed
Bill: cut the feet off maybeh?
Aldus (Jess): Could
Afina (Georgia🍀): Get some sexy water shoes? 😂
Aldus (Jess): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Elfriede (Tom): oof
Bill: snrk.
Aldus (Jess): Honestly a suit like the one I posted, but cut the bottom off and trim to mach hers, put her design on it, then hot pants and your good leggings optional
Bill: I get wanting to do the plate lines though. They really define A2.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof swimsuit material is the only thing I haven't fucked with yet
Aldus (Jess): It's a swimsuit version your allowed to take creative liberty
Aldus (Jess): Gloves would be cool, maybe I should I think about that
Aldus (Jess): I'mma have to step up my 2b
Aldus (Jess): Gotta get Nora done first though
Bill: what is the lineup plan for you and tom?
Bill: Cause I was serious, lets see about getting Nier's together.
Bill: * again
Aldus (Jess): At least neir and RWBY
Afina (Georgia🍀): :3c
Bill: I more mean days, cause I'm guessing RWBY saturday cause shoot.
Bill: So Nier friday?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll probably chunk mine Nier/Ladybug Friday (which works cause late night swim), Pyrrha Saturday, Yona Sunday
Aldus (Jess): Georgia we should do some swimsuit material ntesting together 😂
Bill: If we're doing a gathering we need a time.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WE COULD
Bill: swim Yona or Yona Yona?
Aldus (Jess): I'm probably going to alter an allready made bathing suits but it would still be good to know what would work and what wouldn't
Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably Yona Yona
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll pack a swimsuit tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's not that hard to wear a swimsuit under Yonas bathrobe lookin thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yaaaas I already have dark brown bottoms for Pyrrha
Aldus (Jess): Yea that's an easy one
Aldus (Jess): I mean honestly swimsuit cosplay can be as easier or as hard as you wanna make it
Aldus (Jess): Unless the thing has a canon swimsuit, it's free game
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah swimsuits is gonna drive me insane tho
Elfriede (Tom): 😱
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause I'll still want to be recognized
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I'll probably throw in a lot of components of Pyrrha and A2
Bill: Carve a noodle into the shape of Pyrrha's weapons.
Aldus (Jess): Pyrrha is reconized by just her head piece and hair
Aldus (Jess): A red bathing suit would suffice
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no fuck the headpiece if I get a sunburn in that I'll cry
Afina (Georgia🍀): _and I always burn_
Aldus (Jess): I know you won't do that but a person could do that
Aldus (Jess): Last year the outside pools weren't even open
Aldus (Jess): It is in September
Bill: True, CCE isn't about stress.
Bill: And yup, we didn't go outside much. It was cold.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I ain't stresssssin, I'm being thorough
Afina (Georgia🍀): REALLY
Afina (Georgia🍀): Interesting it was hot as balls at Rutgers lol
Aldus (Jess): And A2 you'll be with me and probably Tom as 9s? Maybe there's not way you won't be recognized
