Nokri (Marisa): random cosplay tutorials on tumblr are hashtag blessed
i just found exactly what i needed on my dash
Nokri (Marisa): I order stuff online to send to the US in my name. I request the packages be left in a pile somewhere at home so they don’t get lost. 
BoJo takes them to the neighbors house and opens them there. BoJo why.
Aldus (Jess): why tho?
Elfriede (Tom): Bojo whyyyy
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t know. She brought my last package to my sisters house too but didn’t open it until she got home, which is fine because at least I know which packages actually arrived. 🤷
Nokri (Marisa): But like. What’s she gonna do if she’s at the neighbors and forgets a stack of bra inserts there. How’s she gonna explain that.
Nokri (Marisa): “Yes these are just my 300 small plastic Santas that I need for reasons, and which I opened at your house just because.”
Aldus (Jess): so she bring the package from home to your neighbors and opens it there instead of at home? 😮
Nokri (Marisa): Yyyeahhh. Well mail doesn’t get delivered to our house, we have a communal mailbox in the middle of the neighborhood but our house is one of the closest to it. It’s like three big cages with 100 or so shoebox sized mailboxes on them. Our mail gets mixed up with the neighbors easily because of this. But it was delivered to the right place. 
I think she’s checking the mail as she leaves the house for some reason? Instead of as she comes home? And just takes the mail around on her daily stuff but the packages are too big to fit in her purse so she just carries them. Which makes less sense why she’d open them because then there’s a big hole that stuff (~~300 tiny plastic santas~~ ) could fall out of
Nokri (Marisa): The mailbox isn’t far at all though. It’s actually in between the parking lot and our house so it’d be on the way in.
Aldus (Jess): ooo ok so its more like she was visiting them before going home kinda
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah I think so. But then she went on a drive with them somewhere and she has work but she didn’t take her own car and she still has the open package.  🤔
Nokri (Marisa): TLDR amazon needs to implement their drone system already
Nokri (Marisa): These aren’t amazon packages but still that would be cool
Nokri (Marisa): Biru and Andru have been to my development it’s trash town lol
Bill: It’s fine.
Nokri (Marisa): You’re not there when we have the exciting drug busts or when all the teenagers roaming around at midnight get rounded up by the police it’s very thrilling
Nokri (Marisa): Tho I think drug busts are a normal part of any neighborhood
Bill: Sometimes.
Nokri (Marisa): Tax dollars at good work
Nokri (Marisa): Doing whatever happens during whatever they do
Nokri (Marisa): Tax dollars would be better spent on parades imo but safety is cool too
Nokri (Marisa): I guess
Nokri (Marisa): Man parades are so cool
Bill: Safety good.
Nokri (Marisa): safety parade feat. the safety dance
Bill: Suuuure.
Bill: safety avacado?
Elfriede (Tom): Ooo yeeee we used to have one of those mailboxes too
Elfriede (Tom): 👌
Elfriede (Tom): That was back. When we lived in a low income housing apparment complex tho
