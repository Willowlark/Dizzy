Afina (Georgia🍀): Gotta recreate this one too
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760> 🙏
Eliran (Halim): That formal photo lowkey looks like Ren and Nora are high fiving each other for successfully wooing their targets
Bill: That's not the right ship boi.
Aldus (Jess): They are all in a relationship together actually
Bill: spare me.
Aldus (Jess): It's just bros being bros
Afina (Georgia🍀): ALL TOGETHER
Afina (Georgia🍀):

Bill: too spicy for BNE.
Bill: All it needs is sarah mcglocklain.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🎵 in the arms of the angles 🎵
Aldus (Jess): Nicu
Bill: that's like, half of schnees.
Bill: not bad, I was worried it'd be as annoying as grey weiss development.
Bill: Grey Weiss is definitely worth the extra effort though, so.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 👉 😎 👉
Bill: Then on to Mystic Mess, then Next stuff.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Thanks I hate it
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Broly no
Dave: Skipped leg day
Nokri (Marisa): broly vs rider
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/100000365379273/posts/1801083943247101/ Finn was mentioned as a part of a (really poorly built) call out post.
Bill: Hopefully the link works.
Bill: Oh Sarah is involved as well.
Nokri (Marisa): callout post isn't viewable <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/RoyaMazaeiHasAHugeNose/posts/1979902038721427 try that one.
Nokri (Marisa): awww yiss there's the drama
Nokri (Marisa): thank
Nokri (Marisa): o so fin isn't the one being called out ok. i was trying to think like "what would she be called out for" but she's just involved in it
Bill: Ye, Finn is the one of the harassees.
Aldus (Jess): what even
Bill: It's not a really well put together call out tho. Usually the evidence is well presented.
Aldus (Jess): i wanna read the rest of the messages from her, but like it seems that hes butthurt she doesnt wanna be friends
Bill: Yeah, he's a dick but like, lots of people are dicks.
Aldus (Jess): seems to your average alpha male bs
Nokri (Marisa): to take him down you must defeat him in hand to hand combat
Nokri (Marisa): i can't wait to see cosplays of this
Aldus (Jess): YAS omg
Nokri (Marisa): why are all my fave characters that i wanna cosplay from obscure manga no one knows of
Aldus (Jess): cuz you read so many mangos
Nokri (Marisa): i have narrowed it down...... to 4 that i will start with once i get regular use of a sewing machine........ but if i don't find another before these 4 are done i'mma start doing characters no one knows
Aldus (Jess): are you going to get a sewing machine for your apartment or is this for when you get home?
Nokri (Marisa): when i get home. sewing machines here are super expensive and we literally have like 50 of them at home.
bojo asked if she should send me a little hand machine that looks like a stapler and sews, we have a few of those but then I'd spend too much money on fabric and waste too much time
Nokri (Marisa): ~~which can wait until i'm back in the US~~
Bill: yeeee
Bill: Come home.
Bill: I don't even know the middle two.
Nokri (Marisa): lizzie and raphtalia
raphtalia is from an anime whose trailer came out last year but there haven't been any updates since 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): also it's in english for some reason hehe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjezREyZI2U
Aldus (Jess): what lizzie from?
Nokri (Marisa): black butler!
Aldus (Jess): OOOO yea i saw like 3 episodes of daty
Nokri (Marisa): this is her outfit from one of the movies

Aldus (Jess): fancy
Nokri (Marisa): did you and tomu watch any yona last night
Aldus (Jess): YE 2 eipsodes
Aldus (Jess): they got blue boi
Nokri (Marisa): blu: obtained
Aldus (Jess): hes adorable
Aldus (Jess): now they gonna go get green boi
Bill: I thought black bulter was about guys.
Bill: I meant gays, but yes.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): pure boy. now they're going after sin boy.
Aldus (Jess): OOO
Nokri (Marisa): kuroshitsuji is messed up it's about a lot of things.
Nokri (Marisa): lots of murder and genocide involved
Aldus (Jess): and here i thought it was about some whinny kid and a butler
Nokri (Marisa): it also has a ton of female nudity like even though 12 year olds like it it's definitely not for kids
Nokri (Marisa): sebastian sleeps with beast when infiltrating the circus so the anime has a very naughty scene of that
Nokri (Marisa): beast is a chick
Bill: ~~not male nudity?~~
Nokri (Marisa): not really.
Bill: I'm confused.
Nokri (Marisa): oh the wolf guy is nude a lot but he dies quickly. meanwhile there are like 3 or 4 girls regularly shown being assaulted or just not wearing clothes
Aldus (Jess): 😱
Aldus (Jess): jeez i was way off
Bill: This show had fangirls like crazy, what. I thought it was guy abs and that's why they all wanted to be the little boy.
Aldus (Jess): ~~sounds like they'd rather be that beast girl~~
Nokri (Marisa): it's dark <:lenny:395307171539189760> girls love murder and dark stuff
there are shounen-ai undertones at parts? but nothing concrete. ciel (main chara boy) has a fiance, sebastian (butler) sleeps around to get intel a few times.
Aldus (Jess): you right
Bill: 
Bill: Did someone say *wata flowa*
Afina (Georgia🍀): oooooooo
Bill: Whoops I buzzkilled the horse idea.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I was thinking the same thou
Bill: But you leave me to say it and be the smarmy bastard? <=P
Afina (Georgia🍀): Smarmy?
Bill: Kinda like snarky.
Aldus (Jess): i uhhh dont know what to say to that
Bill: I still lean no right now, assuming none of my concerns become an issue. I’m thinking I’ll suggest Rebecca for it. If you guys go for RNJR I’d go with you and shoot from the side lines, but. I have to think it through when I get back home.
Bill: (Unrelated: I realize I totally feel like a senpai to Rebecca and Jaime, but I don’t think that’s actually right. Right?)
Aldus (Jess): yea i wouldn't feel like that you just feel like that cuz they are also cosplayers at the same time
Bill: Also that I'm kinda the default shooter for the majority of BNE.
Bill: But yeah.
Bill: I'm just a senpai at heart.
Afina (Georgia🍀): If gen doesn't make the leg armor out of worbla, I'm gonna say it now, she's screwed
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause that shit takes a beating after walking and crouching all day
Bill: Did you tell her to?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee
Bill: yup, vent again.
Bill: maybe I should unmute that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Me and Ginny were doing a learn lol
Bill: Vent has been cured of the edgy nature it was born with.
Bill: Civil war meme:
Ginny: Foam
Georgia: Worbla
Civil War
Bill: ~~also that neck piece is comfortable???~~
Aldus (Jess): wow armor sounds terrible
Bill: are you guys nah on horse shoot?
Aldus (Jess): i dont know
Aldus (Jess): we did talk about it
Bill: hasn't been brought up properly before today I thought. The RNJR part.
Aldus (Jess): i dont see the point in commiting until shes got got nailed down
Bill: ~~it's that guy who was "talking" to us outside cosplay repair <@!228287793099440128> <@!245270932602486784>~~
Aldus (Jess): oo thats the guy who through the blanket on justin
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooo hmmm yeah didn't like him
Aldus (Jess): yea he was super creappy
Dave: Yep
Eliran (Halim): VIVA LA FOAM
Bill: ~~Worbla makes for more accurate armor that stands out in an image~~
Bill: Though if I'm picking a side, I'm going with the ~~hobbits~~ 3d printing.
Eliran (Halim): Foam is far cheaper, and if you know what your doing looks just as good, and tends to chafe far less
Eliran (Halim): Most crazy armors do not use worbla, but thick foam as a base 
Like halo armor
Aldus (Jess): ~~so you can feel like yourself~~
Eliran (Halim): Like your true self yes
Afina (Georgia🍀): Pyrrha leg armor tho, if you kneel, you'll crush that knee piece in regular foam
Bill: I uh. Think Sarah is live streaming a boudoir shoot.
Aldus (Jess): O lovely
Bill: She’s mostly out of the phone frame, just can see photographer and that Sarah’s on a bed.
Nokri (Marisa): Animenext films their entire masq and posts it in YouTube every year
Nokri (Marisa): Is the horse shoot in the other group a nucklavee shoot?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye
Nokri (Marisa): WOAH
Nokri (Marisa): If help is needed photoshopping the horse at all that sounds like fun
