Nokri (Marisa): oooooo it seems literally *anything* disney is allowed to be cosplayed in the parks as long as it isn't marvel
Nokri (Marisa): also someone I know who's a metaton cosplayer got into the park in their giant metaton costume? not metaton EX but like. regular square metaton. howhy.
Bill: I thought Disney had a strict no cosplay policy.
Bill: Also they look FANTASTIC holy crap.
Nokri (Marisa): usually yeah cosplay is 100% banned unless you're five.
tokyo disney parks have a special thing in september and october that when the halloween event is going on you're allowed to cosplay. disney characters only, and no mask, props, or excessive makeup
Nokri (Marisa): well, no big props
Nokri (Marisa): everybody come over and cosplay

Nokri (Marisa): (that's in english despite the preview)
Nokri (Marisa): disney cosplayers don't mess around
~~that donald is the real donald but the toy stories are cosplayers~~
Nokri (Marisa): and they get super obscure too. every character from literally anything disney is fair game.
Nokri (Marisa): you have to always be fully covered, no strapless outfits and every shirt or dress must have sleeves, but some people manage to use witchcraft and find the perfect skin colored fabric

Nokri (Marisa): that's my disney wonderment thanks for listening
Bill: If I part my hair in the middle, and get enough poof... itâ€™s the non anime Hazel hairstyle.
Bill: Needs to be longer.
