Nokri (Marisa): Do we know this person oops I feel bad I’ve been ignoring their messages but I didn’t realize they existed until right now
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Nope I don't know them at least
Aldus (Jess): Classic insta boi
Aldus (Jess): "cool" "wow" "nice"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That would be been way funnier if it was just me
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nice pose
Nokri (Marisa): 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): What if there was no person in the story
“Nice pose” it’s like a cactus
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 
Nokri (Marisa): NICE POSE

Nokri (Marisa): oo are u guys making bunny suits for rtx? rest in pieces that will be fun
Bill: Not Georgia or Hal.
Nokri (Marisa): oo
Bill: who are the only ones going to RTX here.
Nokri (Marisa): i saw it in georgia's story but maybe it was just an advertisement
Nokri (Marisa): bunny suits suck to make
Nokri (Marisa): but it was fun when meg worked at a sewing supply store and when i bought boning online she'd write notes and put them in the package
Nokri (Marisa): it kind of scared me the first time i thought meg was trapped in a sewing supply store
Nokri (Marisa): bunny voltron cosplay when
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oh no 😱 poor meg
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'd pay to see bunny pidge lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Something about that just doesn't sit right
Bill: Jess rn: 👀
Aldus (Jess): ? y tho
Nokri (Marisa): it'd be weirdest for the only girl in the entire group to wear a bunny outfit
Aldus (Jess): i feel like pidge would be the most out of place in a bunny suit XD
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): thats beautiful
Nokri (Marisa): the bunnystuck group are my heroes their outfits are on point
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): DAMN
Nokri (Marisa): wait, there were multiple bunnystuck groups? that's not ceri as vriska. 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): wow yeah there were multiple groups. huh. all their outfits on point though.
Bill: Mawisa has bunny suit(s).
Nokri (Marisa): ya
Nokri (Marisa): i need to redo lucina's tho it sucks
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I of course meant everyone not just pidge but pidge would def feel the most out of place with it 🙏
Nokri (Marisa): kaltenecker too
Nokri (Marisa): Hi welcome to lazy town
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): My Mirai wig needs more layers and it’s too pink but maybe that can be hidden with styling
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Not that pinkk
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's pretty close
Nokri (Marisa): might be the lighting, this is more suited for a luka wig and looks much pinker in light. if i had some talcum powder that would take care of the color problem 🤔
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ohhh that pink yee, ehh that's not sooo bad
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Just a little desaturation needed
Nokri (Marisa): moves down the desaturation of life <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oh God, if you had control of the saturation of life everything would be blobs of cmyk and rgb
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *it makes my cosplay look better guis* ❤
