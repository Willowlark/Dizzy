Bill: Your saved.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Ooooo that's my birthday 😂
Bill: The concept of snow talking to anyone privately just sends a shiver down my spine.
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> if you phrase as you did, makes us sound like Beach Day. =/
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean its a public beach vs a privately booked part of campus
Bill: Different, since we aren't trying to run a public event privately, but still.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah we dont really WANT this to be a public event
Afina (Georgia🍀): we want it to be just a large scale hangout
Bill: I'm going to have to point out at some point I am *not* taking photos for every person, group, and team present.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~team NRTH priority? 😜 ~~
Bill: Between the backlog, the time investment at the event, and the general mood that'll put me in I'll feel like a cheap whore.
Bill: for lack of a better term.
Bill: down child. Rebecca and Jaime are photographers.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye i gotchu boi

Bill: great minds and all that.

Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~now to acquire 4 more hands~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): would be kinda cool 😮
Bill: I'm saying you, Jess, ~~not snow~~, anyone could pick em up.
Afina (Georgia🍀): gasp and i do know what i like to see from photos
