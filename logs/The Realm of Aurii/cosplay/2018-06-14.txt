Afina (Georgia🍀): And I'm like ahhhh ~~I don't wanna befriend you ho~~
Bill: stop replying.
Bill: it's not rocket science.
Afina (Georgia🍀): But that's rude
Bill: he hasn't taken the hint. isn't that rude? Also better he go find something productive to do.
Bill: for his own sake.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I guess he spends his whole day messaging Instagram people like wtf
Afina (Georgia🍀): Too many people are like "hi can we be friends" and it's like UGH
Bill: you've got a kiss shot somewhere with Hal, go post that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): They ain't even tryna fuk but I don't wanna be their friends either
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like no offense to them but no thanks
Bill: Then *don't reply after the first few exchanges*.
Bill: more replies == the person thinking you actually want to respond.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I literally take days to respond like three words and they don't care
Aldus (Jess): yea i get where you are coming from cuz it does feel rude
Bill: sorry, I just don't get it. I'd rather get no reply.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause you're rational Bill
Aldus (Jess): for me its more like "what are they going to do if i dont answer"
Bill: *who cares*
Aldus (Jess): creepy guys get over sealous very fast
Bill: Then there's a block button? It's just a waste of time, for all parties involved.
Bill: I'd rather Grey have snubbed my friend request whenever the fuck that was, because I wouldn't have had to bother.
Aldus (Jess): im just paranoid about running into them at a con or someshit idk
Bill: You don't travel alone at cons anyway.
Aldus (Jess): 🤷
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ya but it's still awkward
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like "why did you block me"
Afina (Georgia🍀): What does one even say, like, "your attempts at friendship annoyed me"
Aldus (Jess): Yea and that doesn't exactly feel right
Afina (Georgia🍀): ALSO HES SO TWO FACED CAUSE HE JUST WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND
