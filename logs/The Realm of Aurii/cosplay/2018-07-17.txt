Bill: why is LTD so popular, his photos are consistently under lit. Especially the ones Gen got.
Nokri (Marisa): Deuce? He staffs at a ton of cons and has a huge web of connections. Everyone knows him.
Nokri (Marisa): Is this guy trying to role play with me
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): wtfff
Nokri (Marisa): It’s too early for that
Nokri (Marisa): I lost my room key once in a really embarrassing cosplay and the hotel was like a 15 minute walk from the con center (Otakon) so it was super awkward trying to get a new key and I can’t remember what I was wearing.
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Nokri (Marisa): OH it was Sinon. I remember because cops on bikes kept stopping me for the huge sniper rifle I was carrying.
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Aldus (Jess): thats scary
Nokri (Marisa): Pro tip don’t lose your room key
Nokri (Marisa): That day I went to the series meet up early because the hosts said they might not show up and I volunteered to be a replacement host and there were two asuna cosplayers. I was like “hey! You here for the photoshoot?” And they were like “...yeah?” And gave me a weird look. 
When the shoot started I didn’t see them but like halfway through they came back and when it ended they said “we’re so sorry we had a private shoot and didn’t realize there was a group meetup. We thought you were trying to butt into our private shoot somehow” hehehe
Aldus (Jess): ooooo opps lmao
Nokri (Marisa): They were super nice I didn’t even think anything of it
Aldus (Jess): casey is weraing ethans t-shirt in her story. it pains me
Nokri (Marisa): ew why would someone cosplay ethan
Aldus (Jess): LMAO
Bill: Just think. It means she was probably out of her shirt with him at some point.
