Nokri (Marisa): i thought dave didn't exist in the material realm
Afina (Georgia🍀): His soul is in the phylactery but his body is not
Dave: found my body, using it for the week
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/346366698707618/posts/2353179831359618/ I have to say, I’m really impressed that she made the post about the actions, not the person. No call out, no names, just a call to do better.
Nokri (Marisa): so she's a dude on facebook but not instagram. makes sense.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow good on her
Afina (Georgia🍀): My ability to tolerate guys begging for my personal attention gets increasingly low as time goes on
Afina (Georgia🍀): Thankfully I don't get harassed too much? But frankly that guy messaging her is preetty creepy
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like? This girl is begging a random girl on the internet to do things to fulfill his own desires then that's highkey pathetic not gonna lie
Bill: Which is why the block button exists. It’s not her or anyone else’s job to teach perverts to be socially acceptable.
Bill: And thankfully indeed.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tom is Rebecca's new photography icon
Afina (Georgia🍀): THE tomukuncosplay and
Aldus (Jess): NICE
Elfriede (Tom): YEAH
Elfriede (Tom): I was just saying that
Bill: ~~I don’t even need boobs and he likes me~~
Dave: The cheeks were a large enough substitute
Aldus (Jess): So I got home and cut accidentally cut myself while putting away dishes and now I'm trying to see with a band-aid on my knuckle and it's so hard 😭
Bill: I know you mean sew but damn if the typo isn’t funny. (Autocorrect always corrects sew to see)
Aldus (Jess): O opps
Aldus (Jess): Yea I mean sew
Bill: I could guess from cosplay channel.
Aldus (Jess): Ignore the shitty lighting and the fact that I look dead
Bill: YEET!
Bill: I dunno what it is exactly but that feels so 2B!
Elfriede (Tom): The top was added and there's a mesh cutout
Aldus (Jess): Ye!
Aldus (Jess): I think this is much more in character this year
Bill: YEEE
Bill: I went back and looked, now I see it.
Aldus (Jess): I didn't do the full patern cuz it wouldn't really fit right with the shape of the top, plus I was taking a chance doing cut out anyway but I think it turned out pretty good
Bill: Looks amazin.
Bill: and better err on the side of caution, lest the suit had been destroyed.
Aldus (Jess): Thank!
