Nokri (Marisa): must've been after the idol arc
Nokri (Marisa):

Nokri (Marisa): office guy
Nokri (Marisa): nice

Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): FAB
Nokri (Marisa): oh wait sebastian isn't even in the phantom 5 whoops he's just their coach
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): BOTTOM LEFT CORNER
CROSSDRESSING IDOLS
Aldus (Jess): I watched like 3 episodes of black Butler on our honeymoon but I never got into in
Nokri (Marisa): it gets better over time
but it takes a loooot of time rip
the manga is better than the anime i think. at least the first season. book of circus and book of murder were alright, and book of the atlantic was pretty neat
Nokri (Marisa): book of circus has a neat intro
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dybNFrCDKvM
Aldus (Jess): How many seasons are there even?
Nokri (Marisa): hmmmm
season 1 with 24 episodes and an OVA
season 2 with 12 episodes and 6 OVAs
Book of Circus with 10 episodes
Book of Murder has 2 episodes but they're like an hour long each
Book of the Atlantic is a movie

then there's a live action movie
there have been 5 different musicals and maybe more plays but i'm not too knowledgeable about them
Nokri (Marisa): the second half of season 1 and all of season 2 is entirely different from the manga
Nokri (Marisa): season 2 doesn't even exist in the manga it's an alternate ending to the series
Aldus (Jess): *starts watching Black Butler* "how long till jumin shows up?"
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Nokri (Marisa): not too long it seems
Nokri (Marisa): OH YEAH sebastian is obsessed with cats too i forgot about that
Aldus (Jess): NICE
Aldus (Jess): That last art is really nice wow
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2QKyhBWTWU
Nokri (Marisa): nice art is nice
Nokri (Marisa): also: ignores all safety precautions to pet a tiger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6osk_21KGs4
Aldus (Jess): The parallels 😮😂
Nokri (Marisa): jaehee goes to get paperwork at the office
20 cats spill out of the supply cabinet
Aldus (Jess): Poor jaehee
Aldus (Jess): ~~omg I have to buy another story so bad~~
Nokri (Marisa): *why haven't you done so yet. jess.*
Aldus (Jess): Because I can't decide who's route to do first 😭
Aldus (Jess): I keep flip flopping like I wanna do Ray's really bad but I feel like if I do Ray's I won't wanna do Vs and I wanna do Vs too so then I'm just indesisive and don't do any
Nokri (Marisa): ooooo tru. V's came out first so do his! But it's super hard not doing ray's because he's so easy ~~I assume. His route hadn't been released yet when I did V's so if you went with him you'd just get a bad end~~
Aldus (Jess): Yea everyone says Ray is EZ boi cuz he's like "yay mc you're here I'm so excited!" And V is like "oh but Rika" is that accurate?
Nokri (Marisa): yuuuuup
V basically sticks with Rika until the end when he's like "you know what? nevermind rika."
Ray is like "HEY MC!" from day 1
Nokri (Marisa): ray has great music
Aldus (Jess): YA everyone says that and I read searans journal thing where ray is like "I cannt wait for her to get here I hope she likes me!" so I'm allready like "what a perfect bean"
Aldus (Jess): V y u glutton for punishment?
Aldus (Jess): Uguuuu decisions 😭
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Plz no 😭😭
Aldus (Jess): "why am I even here?"
Aldus (Jess): Fucking vanderwood
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no Marisa homestuck came to haunt me
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): [wiggles eyes]
Dave: i need a recommendation for shoes for my cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): snazzaroo is water based tho that's why i go with ben nye so i don't sweat it off or have it come off while drinking
Aldus (Jess): Drinking?!?!
Aldus (Jess): 😮😮😮😮😮
Nokri (Marisa): ya u gotta stay hydrated at a con at least drink 1 bottle of water a day
Nokri (Marisa): but i usually use water fountains
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I'm prob just gonna get some form of white slipons
Nokri (Marisa): what type of shoes do you need
Dave: something similar to
Dave: 
Nokri (Marisa): oo fancy
Dave: but has to be size 14 : /
Nokri (Marisa): o so it's a kinky boots situation
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): INTERESTING
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: WAS THAT TO YOU?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: AGHH SHES SO CONFUSING
Afina (Georgia🍀): IKR
Bill: *who invited snow in the first place*
Nokri (Marisa): has there been drama in bne :3c
Nokri (Marisa): wow i just read the backlog. how did that turn to this. seems like a jump
Bill: Snow is asking for trouble to start.
Bill: This is probably the same shit she said to Mist about you.
Bill: I'd like to be sympathetic, but I can't trust Snow.
Bill: I'd make it clear you have nothing to do with who gets added to the server.
Nokri (Marisa): ye isn't the person with the green username the admin
Bill: ~~Hal?~~
Nokri (Marisa): the ozpin from konkon who does the cute ruby cosplay?
oh is hal the admin?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nah your thinking Rie I think
Nokri (Marisa): hallo
Bill: Hal is owner, Reiley has some permissions.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nah you haven't met this one
Nokri (Marisa): ooo
Bill: Marisa met Reiley, not Snow yeah.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She showed up just before katsu
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She's sometimes in a wheelchair and sometimes not
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Not sure why exactly
Nokri (Marisa): a mystery :0
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah she just kinda said that there was a reason she sometimes needed it
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: She's def given me the *lies for drama* vibe since the beginning
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's v confusing
Bill: I'm the one who says BNE isn't actually close friends (friends, but not like this group), but it's still bothering me to have her toxicing the place up...
Aldus (Jess): I mean she def. confusing af. and has left a bad impression from the begining, but i would say she toxicing BNE up
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah I was kinda almost flipping over to trusting her more as she hadn't really done anything in a long while aside from the *vibes* and Leanna obv trusts her but..
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I can't say she's wrong are lying or anything I just have a bad feeling
Bill: agreed. You know I trust my gut.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Plus the thing with Georgia in the beginning is so odd. When had Georgia bullied anybody?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like seriously
Aldus (Jess): yea. ive delt with that type before
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeahhhh that was weird
Afina (Georgia🍀): I felt like that was her trying to "claim" me over mist somehow doing so??? Idk
Bill: And now she's turned in the reverse.
Bill: Whole thing reeks.
Aldus (Jess): i get the impression that her and mist had beef years ago and they prob both said some shit but she saw herself as innocent so she twisting it to make herself look like the only victim or something but thats alot of speculation
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^^ that's a good theory at least
Bill: I believe it.
Aldus (Jess): on time in  my freshman yr of highschool me and these girls had a huge fight on deviant art of all things and they deleted all of thier comments making it look like me and my best friend were the aggressors, when in reality i was trying to diffuse the situation for the most part. but i almost for kicked out <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I'm at the point where I want to comment 'enough gossip mongering' to BNE as a whole. I don't have the phrasing down right to say it though.
Aldus (Jess): that was probably the biggest drama of my life
Afina (Georgia🍀): Based on that giveaway I did people mostly like the photos of me alone but _I do not like to be alone_
Bill: awww.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like here's the top photos again
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Only three of them am I posed with another person
Afina (Georgia🍀): Though me and msginnyliz is also one of my most liked photos now too
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I knew I should've picked the homestuck one
Bill: Ah yes, the charts I need to be more on.
Afina (Georgia🍀): If you wanna see the numbers
Aldus (Jess): i think that may have been partially due to the "post your favorite picture of me" part
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hmmm that's possible too
Afina (Georgia🍀): The phrasing could be biased
Aldus (Jess): like i purposely didnt pick any why other poeple cuz i thought it was for "pictures of YOU" specifically
Bill: stupid Ben and his stupid good photo.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why ARE Bens photos well received?
Afina (Georgia🍀): The yellow leaves one I get but otherwise idk
Bill: Good tones I'd guess.
Bill: Weiss feels very pale, Pyrrha has a brightness/fall to it.
Bill: I personally like to make sure the eyes are clear in a photo, but it apparently works for him.
Bill: And there's always the 'Composition/technique means nothing if it looks cool' factor, which I'm pretty bad at acknowledging.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Be is Ben, Bi is Bill, C is Claire, M and J are photographers I only ran into or hired once
Bill: <:dva_salt:365521119534645254>
Bill: I'll be best soon.jpg.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Bestboibillam
Bill: I thought I had the majority for some reason, but Ben has both top image and majority. =/
Aldus (Jess): ~~But Billy's not BI~~
Bill: 
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: https://youtu.be/lN8U1EtQsyY
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ah dang I posted two Weiss pics back to back
Afina (Georgia🍀): I hate doin that
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh well
Dave: #instagramfamousproblems

Afina (Georgia🍀): I thiiiink I wanna sneak in Yang Saturday morning just for the RWBY meet up cause her make up is basically the same as Lux besides the eyebrows
Afina (Georgia🍀): So Friday is Yona/Formal Pyrrha, Saturday is Yang/Lux, and Sunday is still up in the air a bit
Afina (Georgia🍀): I could do Yurippe or Ladybug or Star or even a casual Weiss or Pyrrha depending on fatigue
Aldus (Jess): kinda wanna squeeze in some pj JNPR but i dont remeber when hal is leaving
Bill: It'd need to be thursday or friday night.
Bill: Ideally, last I checked he's expecting thursday friday nights at the con.

Atalantia Enneka (Allison): In terms of Sunday stuff

Bill: Oh, what from noragami?
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Kofuku
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): So as of rn my options for the weekend are her, futaba, and Ann (panther version)
Aldus (Jess): OMGGGG
Afina (Georgia🍀): They have smol 1 inch heel like normal boots
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): But I'd even do kofuku more than once cause one of my friends is cosplaying for her first time and really wanted to group cosplay haha
Aldus (Jess): that would be cool! more decisons 🤔
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Yeah just thought I'd throw the option in there now that I definitely know it's happening
