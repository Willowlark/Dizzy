Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah it's to get that animu
Bill: Wait, so what's going on with Sakura? Mist I saw the stories, she shouldn't let dumbasses bother her but she's justified to be salty.
Bill: There's nothing for Sakura other than she's awol for personal reasons.
Aldus (Jess): did see anything about sakura yet
Aldus (Jess): ooo you mean georgias story
Bill: I don't follow sakura because post storms, but she's a nice enough person I care I'd like to know what's wrong.
Bill: Still appreciate how patient she was during GB JNPR at Katsu, given how dead I was.
Bill: and Morningmist is supposed to be nice?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh she said she's gonna post it publicly later but I'll tell y'all because you can keep a secret
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sakura has to put her kitty down tomorrow for health reasons
Aldus (Jess): OH NO 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): And she just moved to New York so she's in an unfamiliar place and dealing with that
Afina (Georgia🍀): So she's pretty bummed
Bill: That's terrible.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah so it's just a whole conglomeration of bad stuff going on for her
Afina (Georgia🍀): _so I saw my chance to spread positivity and took it_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Both women messaged me saying they appreciated the support too, so that's good
Afina (Georgia🍀): And the harassment especially is stupid as heckie
Bill: The harassment is just... petty. The high road is to not let it get to you sure, but I understand why Mist is salty.
Bill: None of her followers business anyway.
Bill: I thought Sakura was originally from NY though?
Afina (Georgia🍀): uhhh who knows
Afina (Georgia🍀): even still shes lived in boston a while it sounds like
Afina (Georgia🍀): so its not like shes coming back to much if thats the case
Bill: for college.
Afina (Georgia🍀): aside from like the jesses
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye
Bill: Unless her boyfriend is still up there, I'd say it's probably a nice change. You miss your besties when you stay longer at school. I'd know.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think he might be but idk
Afina (Georgia🍀): his profile says hes going to more boston-located cons
Bill: 
Afina (Georgia🍀): too real
Bill: *aw man*.
Bill: That came from Grey.
Bill: and if I actually knew her, I have the perfect pun.
Bill: "How very black and white of you, Grey."
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oh.man, ye def too real, even I get those
Bill: ~~I don't~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's only cuz of commenting on nerd pages
Bill: tru.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~cool and funny tomukun cosplay gets them i never would have guessed~~
Bill: I'll snoop on some accounts, the worst is the ones with no real pictures what so ever.
Bill: That's like.
Bill: a red flag.
Afina (Georgia🍀): super red flag
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Mangaloo copied you Georgia.
Afina (Georgia🍀): wha
Afina (Georgia🍀): hue hue mimicry is the most sincere form of flattery
Bill: Indeed.
Afina (Georgia🍀): mangoloo REALLY loves morningmist for some reason tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): its like super obvious
Afina (Georgia🍀): like mist is her token weiss i think
Eliran (Halim): They're really good friends
Eliran (Halim): Also her token Weiss is Noju/Mist,
Eliran (Halim): As far as I can tell
Eliran (Halim): They tend to be her big Weiss cosplayer
Eliran (Halim): Also noju straight up called the account out
Eliran (Halim): christ what a dick thing to do to somebody 
-finally caught up on the mist probs-
Eliran (Halim): also so looking at the BNE vent chat
Eliran (Halim): but I've always heard it the opposite way around 
and not from mist
Eliran (Halim): about the bullying thing
Bill: we all snow is touble.
Eliran (Halim): i wasn't sure if it was a typo or a pun lol
Bill: If we trust David, which I do to a degree, more than snow anyway, Snow was talking shit to Mist about Georgia.
Bill: Not something you'd do with someone whose a bully.
Bill: Snow is a contradiction and therefore a liar.
Eliran (Halim): yeahhh
Eliran (Halim): yeah
Bill: Whatever her problem is, idc, but she so long as she shits elsewhere I won't deal with it.
Bill: I also wouldn't trust her with anything, let alone knowledge or my opinions.
Bill: That vent channel is a drama trap as much as shitposting on someone.
Bill: Gives people like Snow/Ethan fuel.
Bill: (so y'all should mute the heck out of it too.
Aldus (Jess): Your not my real dad!
Bill: *Thank god*
Bill: I had thought for so long...
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeah im still super weary of her, and that didnt do much to help it
Eliran (Halim): i also just don't understand... why? she brought it up
Bill: Attention whore.
Bill: And she stirs up drama.
