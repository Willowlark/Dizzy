Bill: I didn't listen to any of the video segments.
Eliran (Halim): She admitted to helping the people start and use the accounts
Bill: If you are going to take a public, negative action against someone, you'd best be ready for people to give it right back to you.
Eliran (Halim): Yeahhhhh
She claims she didn't have anything to do with the accounts after the fact 
But that stanks  of bullshit 
Also apparently somebody gave out mists  number 
And imma side with the jellyfish cause that's not something just anybody would have
