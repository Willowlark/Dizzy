Nokri (Marisa): if you say her name out loud that has a number :3c
Nokri (Marisa): this week was basically "comiket is over! i can gorge on chocolate for every meal again!"
haha there's an acosta this weekend *whoops*
Nokri (Marisa): i can't log into twitter anymore i keep seeing pictures of me ~~and they're really good i'm just too embarrassed to log in and see them when i log in to look at everyone else's pretty cosplays~~
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): This guy and two other people all messaged me with pics in a five minute span. Are they coordinating this
Nokri (Marisa): When is colossal east
Aldus (Jess): September 7-9
Bill: Nah you look good Mawisa. Though I wouldn‚Äôt have expected the lean forward pose from you.
Aldus (Jess): Click Dem I wanna seeeee
Bill: Search for Marisa‚Äôs twitter handle on twitter. They‚Äôre public posts.
Nokri (Marisa): üò≠
Sometimes people ask for poses. They don‚Äôt demand it they‚Äôre always like ‚Äúpls could you maybe.... do this if that‚Äôs ok pls.‚Äù
Got the lean forward, got using the stool a few, and some people were like ‚Äúpls do ‚úåÔ∏è‚Äù really seriously
Nokri (Marisa): I forgot like half the poses I came up with so I started stealing ideas that were given
Nokri (Marisa): Jess u don wanna see they scary
Bill: As long as you were comfortable.
Nokri (Marisa): It was ten billion degrees I was melting. The photogs were literal balls of water
Nokri (Marisa): I felt I pulled off Morgiana better but I only gots two pictures of her back
Bill: That looks super uncomfortable tho.
Nokri (Marisa): stOP WHY U POST THAT SIN HERE
Aldus (Jess): You look cute tho!
Nokri (Marisa): OH I‚Äôm actually sitting on a STOOL STOP POSTING PICS THEY DIS IT AGAIN
Bill: I can‚Äôt bend my legs like that.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs the same thing 
Did he delete the post oh no I didn‚Äôt steal the pics yet
Nokri (Marisa): Oh yeah he‚Äôs fixing the info. He originally wrote ‚Äú1st day‚Äù on the pics but this was a 2nd day costume
Bill: There‚Äôs so much filter tho.
Bill: Damn.
Nokri (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Japanese Cosplay Photography is weird.
Nokri (Marisa): Someone took a picture of how I was sitting from the side, basically I was half falling off the stool I brought. You can see it in the background of some pics. The bottom of the stool partially melted doing that woo
Bill: ~~the filtering is probably part of your concern, it‚Äôs at the level where it becomes unflattering~~
Nokri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): ~~but the filters are why i look flattering~~
Nokri (Marisa): where are any of my sewing needles right now i have like 50
Bill: Nope. Most of the contrast is gone. Contrast is key to definition.
Nokri (Marisa): s a t u r a t i o n
Bill: Doesn‚Äôt fix contrast.
Nokri (Marisa): got them needles
Nokri (Marisa): saturation fixes everything
Aldus (Jess): are you hand sewing? üòÆ
Nokri (Marisa): ye the costume i bought yesterday doesn't have the bows or the arm pieces and it looks really weird without them. i already don't have pigtails (i'm gonna tuck my wig under, luckily ranka's hair is ambiguous so i can puff it out that way) so i'm gonna make some crummy dollar store sleeves
Aldus (Jess): whoa
Aldus (Jess): i am not good at the hand sew
Aldus (Jess): ~~im not good at the sew perios but i digress~~
Nokri (Marisa): u can ‚≠ê do it
it easy if u hide the horrible flaws
Nokri (Marisa): u are ‚≠ê fantastic at sews
Nokri (Marisa): the headband in the picture above is handsewed, and morg's leg thingy were made in like 10 minutes ~~but they're not accurate shh~~
Bill: *see* says Marisa!
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i'm quitting aurii~~
Nokri (Marisa): i still have a pile of bows here they handmade u want question mark
Nokri (Marisa): OH AND I FOUDN PIKACHU FABRIC TODAY
Nokri (Marisa): at the dollar store
Nokri (Marisa): yeah
Nokri (Marisa): wow these arm things suck good thing this event is at night
Aldus (Jess): marisa you are inspiring me to sew but i am at work
Nokri (Marisa): do it just whip out your sewing kit
Aldus (Jess): das at home too! D:
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): WHY DON'T U CARRY IT EVERYWHERE
Nokri (Marisa): i almost got arrested here because of that but that's another story i'm typing something else aa
Aldus (Jess): i used to carry super glue everywhere
Nokri (Marisa): i hope you made glue puns
Nokri (Marisa): paula was supposed to be our alibaba but she forgot when comiket was and made other plans and wasn't committed enough to reschedule those
but i went over her house to do a costume fitting and she said the pants were cutting off circulation in her legs and i was like "that's how you know it's working that's cosplay"
Elfriede (Tom): You are probably the closest thing to Marie they've ever seen so üëå
