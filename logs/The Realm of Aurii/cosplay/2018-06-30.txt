Bill: I had looked earlier tho, actually haven’t shoot Pyrrha solo since you had the original pieces. Like, all of them. Corset, wig, leg armor...
Bill: See what you get from Ben tho, time for other ideas is more valuable I’d say.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ben today was mostly a test run for the shoes
Afina (Georgia🍀): which btw are 100 times better and im never going back, even if the original ones are more canonical
Elfriede (Tom): good good 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): so now begins the journey of pyrrha 3.0, the final pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): which is basically just perfecting the leg armor and then im 100% happy

Elfriede (Tom): Ooo neeto!
Bill: Yo hate how good those look. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Elfriede (Tom): Howed he get that angle on that ground one with rei?
Afina (Georgia🍀): he stood on tippy toes and lifted the camera above his head
Afina (Georgia🍀): which i learned cameras are heavy so
Afina (Georgia🍀): im glad i didnt know that beforehand or i wouldve thought he would drop the camera on mah face
Afina (Georgia🍀): like shooting at anext, bills camera was kinda heavy
Afina (Georgia🍀): ben had a mammoth lens on his though and idk that camera was THICC
Elfriede (Tom): OOF
Elfriede (Tom): Still that's cool 👌 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye and having reiley there was awesome too
Afina (Georgia🍀): i dont like shooting alone orz
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I was just saying that to Jess last night how I'm glad reiley went with you
Elfriede (Tom): Cuz I'd want a Friend there as well
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah reiley never has plans ever so if i go "hey come with me" theyre just like "ok"
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean im not worried about being creeped on, ive shot with ben a few times
Afina (Georgia🍀): i just hate shooting alone as a rule of thumb lol
Bill: You talking about different reasons for being alone at shoot.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH PRINCESS VIRGO FOUND ME TOO
Bill: You still shoot alone for some of it tho.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like solo shots?
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i mean pyrrha and weiss can only work so many ways
Afina (Georgia🍀): and my solo shots always do better on insta
Afina (Georgia🍀): and its easier to capture the details of the cosplay
Afina (Georgia🍀): but also its just kinda lonely to shoot solo
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats less prominent with you bill because were friends first so i can derp around with you lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): but with claire or ben, the other peeps i usually shoot with, its a little more formal
Bill: Well you hung out with Ben after right?
Bill: Maybe you’re getting a little more informal?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye i invited him and his apprentice to chilis
Afina (Georgia🍀): she was really nice
Afina (Georgia🍀): she talked to rei a lot
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think thats cause she also gay, tryna find more gays
Bill: Two can definitely help with that lol.
Bill: What’s Bens day job? He isn’t a full time photographer is?
Afina (Georgia🍀): he was doing a lot of stuff for his dads construction company last i heard
Afina (Georgia🍀): now hes working for a car show company, taking photos of cars, which is like his dream job
Afina (Georgia🍀): he wants to start up some side projects of doing his own outside photographer (he shot for a wedding last month) but that hasnt really taken off
Bill: So is a full time photographer, pretty much. Makes me feel better, that down shot is *good shit*.
Bill: I don’t know how he kept his own shadow from showing up.
Bill: Maybe with flashes?
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh well that was just the way the sun was probably
Bill: Did he use flash?
Afina (Georgia🍀): we were in a courtyard
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah no flash
Elfriede (Tom): There's def some shopping on those pics those
Elfriede (Tom): With the shadows
Elfriede (Tom): Which is fine
Afina (Georgia🍀): he shopped his feet out of the pyrrha/weiss one LOL
Elfriede (Tom): Just don't go trying to compare yourself to shopping billiam
Bill: Ye, particularly the colored shadow on the edges.
Elfriede (Tom): Unless you wanna pic up shopping but
Elfriede (Tom): That's time consuming
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah hes hardcore with photoshop
Afina (Georgia🍀): i watched him edit a little bit on call once
Afina (Georgia🍀): it was nuts
Elfriede (Tom): Speaking of which! I gotta shop that one 9s piccc aggggg
Bill: Ye not what I’m comparing on. The base shot is a *hard* pose.
Bill: Cause shadows and height. I’m jealous of that.
Elfriede (Tom): Oh yeah for that lmao
Bill: We’ve tried it.
Bill: It bombed hard for ota JNPR.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeahhhh
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~i suggested the pose oops~~
Bill: We made it work by shooting against the wall, but the down stuff didn’t work.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~sometimes edgy poses come out so good~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah
Bill: It’s an awesome photo, I just haven’t figured out how to *do it*.
Bill: Man, sometimes I wish I could spend all my time doing photography. Like, as my work work.
Bill: I could never deal with the business side of it, (ie getting any) and photographer definitely doesn’t pay like my field.
Bill: But I wish I had the time to dive and improve more.
Bill: ~~Georgia move closer so I have a on call model~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): his "apprentice" person was really cool too
Afina (Georgia🍀): she had a lot to say about the photography side
Afina (Georgia🍀): she said that doing a cosplay shoot seems really up her alley, cause when she shot with actual models they would be rude and sassy, or legtimately would be like "what do i do"
Afina (Georgia🍀): which i was surprised by
Bill: Indellient added a policy where after 3 years you can take a 3 month unpaid sabbatical. If I’m still with indellient then, I’d take it to do photos the whole time.
Afina (Georgia🍀): conveniently take it during summer and boom on call model
Bill: Models are apparently bitches. I’ve heard it before.
Afina (Georgia🍀): assuming im not interning for like the 10th time
Afina (Georgia🍀): REALLY
Bill: Unless you already in NASA.
Bill: ~~join meme office~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): i got grad school boiiii
Afina (Georgia🍀): i cant join nasa for permanent until thats squared away
Afina (Georgia🍀): man i wanna do skits like the jesses do
Afina (Georgia🍀): that looks so fun
Aldus (Jess): Ah yes princess vigro followed me also
Afina (Georgia🍀): _where did they come from_
Bill: Multiple internships at NASA kid. It happens.
Aldus (Jess): From the virgoland
Afina (Georgia🍀): o well ya
Afina (Georgia🍀): and theres stem meme team as back up 😙
Elfriede (Tom): *where did they go*
Bill: For all you know, NASA will like you enough to sponsor grad school at a local to them university.
Bill: You work part time at nasa and get your degree while you do.
Afina (Georgia🍀): theres no where local to maryland thats huge in astrophysics that i know of 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): the supreme goal would be like, princeton
Afina (Georgia🍀): but thats for really smart people ~~but also that means i could shoot there so much easier wowee~~
Bill: I know someone who was student government president there.
Bill: Made papers during his term for his work.
Bill: I can hit him up to help you out. 😎
Afina (Georgia🍀): (/-w-)/ connections
Bill: But a lot of places will do that if you impress them as an intern.
Bill: ~~Then you’ll move to Maryland and we’ll never see you again~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): /invents a teleporter
Afina (Georgia🍀): "ma'am what inspired you" "i missed my friends and still wanted to do cosplay shoots in princeton so i made a teleporter :D"
Afina (Georgia🍀): whats the pyrrha and weiss ship name?
Afina (Georgia🍀): im seeing "white gold" but idk if thats it
Bill: Check the r/RWBY chart.
Bill: It’s linked in the side bar.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ah yeah north pole and schneekos sound way more familiar
Afina (Georgia🍀): ben just posted about charging to do shoots, im glad hes putting more elbow grease into building a clientbase
Afina (Georgia🍀): i still wonder if he should be charging me for the shoots weve and is just too afraid to ask tho🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): i always thought the same with you bill but now i get that photos and hanging out tend to go hand in hand for us, at least in situations like grey towers
Bill: Future shoots from him offer, past shoots are already done. You can’t backcharge people.
Bill: If I had to choose, I’d rather be your friend and never shoot you again rather than the opposite yes. Plus I have no want for money for shooting. My time is the most valuable thing to me, and time from you is similarly so.
Bill: Time spent together, both for the shoot and when we get together elsewhere, is all I’d want.
