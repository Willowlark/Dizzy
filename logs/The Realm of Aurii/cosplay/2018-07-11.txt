Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye and it's the second largest sheet
Bill: Should have got the big one, you’ll use it.
Bill: Lux breastplate, lux weapon(?), etc.
Bill: I had something else to yell at that emo fuck for.
Bill: Hmm.
Nokri (Marisa): Have u tried wonderflex
Bill: Dad made a joke involving the acronym PVC earlier and he was like “you don’t even know what PVC is” and I was like “excuse me, I know cosplayers, it’s PVC pipe”.
Aldus (Jess): Yeet
Nokri (Marisa): If worbla is too pricey, wonderflex is almost the same thing (one side has mesh on it but can be primed smooth) and the big rolls about $20 cheaper than worbla
Nokri (Marisa): and for super tiny stuff, instamorph. It’s like $10 for a big container and you can make all sorts of things like staffs or wands or nails or teeth
Nokri (Marisa): Or shoes. I made a heel for a high heel out of it one and it holds up
Aldus (Jess): Mawisa know all the secrets
Elfriede (Tom): Mawisa,master of saving money
Elfriede (Tom): So that said money can be spent on weeb stuff
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why are people asking me relationship advice
Nokri (Marisa): Life hack: if you cry while making cosplay then collect the tears and refine it into salt and sell the salt for more cosplay money
Nokri (Marisa): Georgia you’re in a relationship you’re the expert
Eliran (Halim): i disagree
Eliran (Halim): I'm in a relationship with her
Eliran (Halim): and neither of us know anything about what we're doing
Afina (Georgia🍀): People ask me how to flirt with girls
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm just like idk my boyfriend accidentally flirted with me so I'm not the expert
Nokri (Marisa): Wise words from experts wow
Nokri (Marisa): Give us more of your wondrous experiences knowledge
Nokri (Marisa): Senpai
Nokri (Marisa): Georgia start charging a consultation fee
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg no
Aldus (Jess): Cuz people are like "ooo goals" and then they think you know everything
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nope! Hal was just being friendly and said I looked cute and that's when I went "target acquired"
Aldus (Jess): Yea 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): I shoooould work on cosplay while I'm stuck at home but I'm so lazy
Aldus (Jess): what u workin on
Afina (Georgia🍀): while i wait for worbla to get here, i need to sew pyrrhas ammo bags (after a year of just not doing it lol)

Afina (Georgia🍀): and then when pyrrha and fem jaune are done its A2 TIME WOO
Aldus (Jess): WHOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): Update, one hour later: I did none of those things and instead put a magnet in the back of my corset so I could attach my shield there and not have to carry it
Afina (Georgia🍀): BUT ITS OKAY CAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY COOL
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ignoring how bleh I look, my sunburned thighs, and disinterested sister, ITS REALLY COOL I SWEAR
Aldus (Jess): that so cool!

Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just finished my ammo bag (which is actually just to hold my phone oops)
Afina (Georgia🍀): I still like carrying my little con bag so I don't need another ammo bag for my wallet or anything
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I DO like keeping my phone readily accessible
Afina (Georgia🍀): So voila
Dave: 👍 x2
Bill: Neat.
Bill: Of note, if you have your shield on your back can use the backpack?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean I can put the shield on the bracer then
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or maybe Hal will be a sweetie and combine our con bags ;3c
Bill: That'd work.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm in jo Anns cause i had to drop lily off at college
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I got fabric for my jaune arm socks
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I was trying to think of what else I might need
Afina (Georgia🍀): And it's _nothing_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause I either have the fabric already, or it's only online, or I'm not sewing that part of the cosplay
Bill: Neat.
Bill: ~~Lily is in college?~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no a summer class at brookdale lol
