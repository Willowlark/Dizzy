Elfriede (Tom): Did the icepacks work?
Nokri (Marisa): I didn't bring any today, but I bought a box on my way home <:lenny:395307171539189760>
I already have ice packs in my fridge but I bought uhhh like those pocket heat jawns except it's cold instead of hot
Nokri (Marisa): like a renaissance painting
Elfriede (Tom): Ooo they have those!?
Elfriede (Tom): Omgggg that one guy in the back
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH! Japan has a ton of good stuff. I have wet wipes that make your skin cold for a little bit but they didn't help today because it was just SO hot, everyone had a layer of sweat on them. So I bought the cool packs, i'm gonna buy a ton of water before getting there since all the vending machines were sold out within an hour, and I have cooling spray deodorant
Nokri (Marisa): dude doesn't even have a camera he's just admiring
Nokri (Marisa): also this is getting a movie
Nokri (Marisa):
