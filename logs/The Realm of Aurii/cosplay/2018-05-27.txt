Nokri (Marisa): nice reinhrdt cosplay biru
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Hey friends, does anyone have any tips on how to keep boot covers from falling down?
Bill: Either Georgia or Marisa will I’m sure. Ones driving the others sleeping.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): No worries
Afina (Georgia🍀): There's a couple options
Afina (Georgia🍀): You could sew in a thicker fabric on the inside like duck canvas
Afina (Georgia🍀): And that'll help prop it up
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also usually if you wear tights, the fabrics will have a little adhesion and the tights would help keep it up
Afina (Georgia🍀): If you're really desperate you can put Velcro on the tights and on the inside of the boot cover and Velcro them up
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Thanks for the suggestions!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no <@!351471675843411978> I forgot to hand you the shoes before I left!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also I forgot to grab the bottle caps before leaving but that's a slightly lesser travesty
Aldus (Jess): I know 😭😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): Will I see you sometime before Anext?
Aldus (Jess): Nah don't worry about it I'll find some
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow I've posted almost everything from Katsu which means I've moved most of my Insta content
Bill: You were a hot mess kid.
