Bill: Huh. We have a thing.
Aldus (Jess): Your mom's?
Bill: I suppose.
Afina (Georgia🍀): someone asked to commission a full pyrrha cosplay from me whoa
Nokri (Marisa): omg are u gonna do it
Nokri (Marisa): that would be so expensive
Afina (Georgia🍀): IT WOULD
Afina (Georgia🍀): im making a price sheet
Afina (Georgia🍀): like wow, its hard to really understand how much i spent on pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): the answer is, A LOT
Nokri (Marisa): i'd imagine you have to charge at least like $750-1000
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh not THAT much
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Hx9q3aGKIuAieoF10jB3ZCm60bdsG_BkvjUzCfOye0/edit#gid=0
Afina (Georgia🍀): heres what my price sheet looks like
Nokri (Marisa): :0
Afina (Georgia🍀): if someone commissions me for most of pyrrha, minus the leg armor and wig, its 400
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats crazy
Nokri (Marisa): THAT'S SO CHEAP
Afina (Georgia🍀): _thats minus leg armor and wig tho_
Nokri (Marisa): ooooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): with leg armor, assuming i could do it, itd prob be +200 and wig is +45
Nokri (Marisa): are you paying yourself minimum wage for this costume
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooooooooooooooooooooo ye that ups the price
Afina (Georgia🍀): if i charge 400, 190 of it is pocketed by me
Afina (Georgia🍀): which is for labor
Afina (Georgia🍀): plus i keep any leftover materials
Nokri (Marisa): who is anonymous ifrit and what's an ifrit
Nokri (Marisa): that's pretty decent
Nokri (Marisa): how long do you expect it would take to make?
Afina (Georgia🍀): depends on the piece
Afina (Georgia🍀): i could bust out a lot of this on one saturday
Afina (Georgia🍀): corsets are NOTHING to me now
Elfriede (Tom): Oof damn, commission
Nokri (Marisa): ~~don't forget to charge for the time it took to make this spreadsheet~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): honestly i could afford to up the corset price a bit cause i forgot paying for rivets
Elfriede (Tom): Would be a nice lil extra cash but it'd be **work**
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeeee at least its work doing things i like
Afina (Georgia🍀): im not sure this guy wants to pay 400 for his girlfriends pyrrha cosplay goddamn
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah exactly
Elfriede (Tom): People don't understand sometimes
Elfriede (Tom): The amount of time it takes
Nokri (Marisa): that's a steal yo
but yeah people don't understand 😭
Nokri (Marisa): if he doesn't want quality they can buy one off ebay for under $200
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah like ive easily put 400 dollars into all my remakes of pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): EASILY
Afina (Georgia🍀): messages the guy back with the link to this spreadsheet and the caption "how much exactly do you love your girlfriend"
Nokri (Marisa): there was a guy at nycc a while ago who commissioned this armor for like $1800 or something and threw a fit when he didn't win a cosplay contest. it's great that they even let him enter without making it.
another time this woman paid like $1000 each for gowns for her two daughters for a formal ball, before zenkaikon had a formal. when she asked when the ball was and we said we didn't have one she flipped out, like "do you know how much i spent on gowns for my daughters?" lady pls calm down i think you far overestimated a cosplay ball
Afina (Georgia🍀): true lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): gosh i feel so bad sending this guy these prices
Afina (Georgia🍀): but like, theyre legit?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah don't feel bad!!!! tbh your prices could be way higher. this is a good estimate.
Nokri (Marisa): you even provided a breakdown
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i calculated labor at 10 dollars an hour, and rounded up my values for cost of materials
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause id rather charge more for materials to be safe rather than sorry
Afina (Georgia🍀): GOSH 480 IS SO MUCH I FEEL SO BAD
Nokri (Marisa): IT'S REASONABLE
Afina (Georgia🍀): if this guy actually commissions me for all $480 worth of cosplay i will cry
Nokri (Marisa): LOOK AT THIS THIS GIRL IS CHARGING LIKE $200 FOR JUST THE CORSET (i think. it's showing me in yen not dollars.)
https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/501939430/pyrrha-nikos-rwby-leather-corset
Nokri (Marisa): you're charging half that for a corset so if he complains just link that
Afina (Georgia🍀): /falls to ground
Afina (Georgia🍀): the guy asking for a commission is 16
Nokri (Marisa): wHAT
Afina (Georgia🍀): theres no way he has 480
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): "hey mom and dad can i have $500 to make my girlfriend a cartoon"
Nokri (Marisa): this poor child don't know what he's doin
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think ill suggest to him that i do like the circlet, bracer, corset
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats like the core pyrrha stuff
Nokri (Marisa): was his age on his profile or is he trying to use that as leverage
Nokri (Marisa): like "pls lower the price im 16"
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah its in his profile
Afina (Georgia🍀): he was really mature in messaging me tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): some people are like that
Nokri (Marisa): that's good
Afina (Georgia🍀): hes also really handy with foam whoa he made a whole halo suit
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe he would be open to trade 👀 1 corset for 1 halo helmet
Nokri (Marisa): that's a good idea!
Afina (Georgia🍀): @grantsarmory if you wanna stalk him too
Nokri (Marisa): he'd probably be able to make the leg armor then too
Nokri (Marisa): :3c thank u for username
Nokri (Marisa): OH IS THAT WHAT LEVEL MEANS
Afina (Georgia🍀): _whats the fun in talking about someone if you cant look at their instagram_
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye!
Nokri (Marisa): the girlfriend already has a pyrrha cosplay :0
could really use a wig update and the corset would be nice to improve but it's not too bad
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah and for leg armor im gonna send him to meg
Afina (Georgia🍀): @megtheredhead
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause shes figured it out better than i have, i still have to update mine lol
Nokri (Marisa): business partners <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOOH maybe i could make the corset if he makes me a fallout power armor helmet
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613dU0a9KoL._UX562_.jpg
Afina (Georgia🍀): like dat
Nokri (Marisa): kind of looks like davey jones crossed with a stormtrooper
Afina (Georgia🍀): its cool shit
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats all that matters
Afina (Georgia🍀): oof i feel so bad sending the link to a 16 y/o
Afina (Georgia🍀): but i did it
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i made a note about possibly doing a commission trade too
Nokri (Marisa): you're giving him different options which is good
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah! im thinking he may bite on the corset
Afina (Georgia🍀): which thankfully his GF is 5'6 and 130 almost exactly like me
Afina (Georgia🍀): so i can test fit a commission corset on myself lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): oof ive only been commissioned once before and it was for a pidge hoodie
Afina (Georgia🍀): it came out really nice tho
Nokri (Marisa): ooo do you have pics?
Afina (Georgia🍀): on my old laptop :c
Nokri (Marisa): wezrez commission business 10/10 stars
Bill: Don’t forget that you need time to do the commission. Time is valuable as well.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah he said he had no specific date
Afina (Georgia🍀): and time depends on which articles he wants
Bill: Ah, kk. Cause you have some RTX crunch then A2 stuff to do, you should come first.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i let this guy know that i wouldnt be able to START working on it til late august
Afina (Georgia🍀): thankfully all the remakes of pyrrha have made me good at everything except the leg armor lol
Bill: Don’t undervalue time spent is all.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeee

Nokri (Marisa): time to sue
Afina (Georgia🍀): me, posing with her at RTX: _internally_ this is not the real ren and nora my life is a sham
Nokri (Marisa): owait she has a discount code with them she gives to her followers maybe she is a promoter. sneky.

Elfriede (Tom): Like didn't know who the cosplayers are or the characters
Bill: You say that like that’s the only reason to visit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The cosplayers lol cause it's all rwby
Elfriede (Tom): ~~wow unknown popular rwby charcacters how is this possible~~
Eliran (Halim): i find myself to be a minorly compelling reason for anybody to visit when I'm not actively doing anything
Bill: I mean once I get down there imma pretty much take an Uber to Lissy and then back, because I expect boozing.
Eliran (Halim): you could save money we'll drop you off and pick you up
Eliran (Halim): assuming we don't also show up at some point maybe
Bill: Wednesday I’m going to visit Andrew in the afternoon.
Nokri (Marisa): tell andru i say hi
Bill: Lol no worries. If it happens that way it happens but y’all have con crunch to do, focus on that.

Eliran (Halim): lol bill you think that by the evening times (which is when I'm guessing lissy's party is) we'll still be crunchin?
