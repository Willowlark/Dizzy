Afina (Georgia🍀): _[CCE hype intensifies]_
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Bill: That scary good kid.
Bill: Stick with the dirty neck, long term. It replaces that one awkward plate line without being creepy.
Nokri (Marisa): can androids shower
Bill: Is that already the tights part?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah that's just me dickin around
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll do some airbrush on tights for a more permanent deal

Aldus (Jess): They go in da water
Afina (Georgia🍀): They do the scrub a dub
Nokri (Marisa): oh yeah they can fish in water!!
Bill: Ducking around *slays*.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think next time I'll go a little darker on the eyeliner and a little lighter on the brows
Afina (Georgia🍀): THANK I feel like after 20 years of life I should be able to look like a tragic android if need be
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah 2B is like: we don't need to bathe and 9s is like BUT IT FEEL GOOD

Eliran (Halim): Which one?
Afina (Georgia🍀): alexa_rynay
Bill: vindictive are we.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH YALL DIDNT KNOW HE SENT ME A MESSAGE OVER RTX WEEKEND??
Afina (Georgia🍀): i forgot to mention
Afina (Georgia🍀): it re-invigorated my pettiness
Bill: you didn't say anything about it no.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): It sounds sorta passive aggressive if you ask me
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I feigned obliviousness and just said thanks
Bill: yeah, he sounds like a dick.
Bill: yet again.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like it wouldn't sound so bad if it was just congrats but I think it's the "... with the rest of us! Good job" that makes it sound shitty
Bill: The "finally" is what rings PA to me.
Afina (Georgia🍀): True
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like. I asked a couple people and no one thinks it sounds genuine
Bill: he's a cock, we know it.
Bill: He just wants attention.
Afina (Georgia🍀): He also talked to me at RTX, just to ask what I thought of Casey's Weiss sword and then walked away
Afina (Georgia🍀): True
Eliran (Halim): Bae everyone in the airbnb told you he was being petty
Eliran (Halim): Even the people not staying at it lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeeeeeeeeaaah
Eliran (Halim): This weekend had loads of shitting on Ethan lol
Bill: Ethan: "This is my new Weiss."
Ethan: "She's edgy."
Casey: "Can I go back to being Nora now?"
Ethan: "Shut up woman, I'm using you to be a dick"
Casey, under breath: "Glad you found one way to use it..."
Afina (Georgia🍀): LABINNAK SHAT ON ETHAN
Afina (Georgia🍀): IT WAS GREAT
Eliran (Halim): Literally every major rwby cosplayer took a shot at Ethan this weekend
Bill: *Insert meme with Georgia in Weiss one side and the inverted dark Weiss from Zenkai on the other*

Normal Weiss: "Georgia"

Dark Weiss: "Georgia when talking about Ethan"
Bill: knowing him he's enjoying it, shit talking or not.
Eliran (Halim): He cant enjoy being actively ignored and avoided
Bill: He's *infamous*.
Bill: That's *edgy*
Bill: Some people want attention, even the negative.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): These two bill? lmao
Bill: exactly.
Aldus (Jess): What is this discourse I come back too? What a DICK
Afina (Georgia🍀): IKR and no one at RTX talked to him except steelwolf
Aldus (Jess): Oh I saw that! What is Casey thinking omg gurl
Bill: Not even Austin?
Eliran (Halim): Literally Ethan only hung with austin steel and casey
Eliran (Halim): And half the time he ditched casey
Eliran (Halim): Leaving her with steelwolf
Aldus (Jess): Wooow nice
Aldus (Jess): What a great guy
Afina (Georgia🍀): He ditched Casey at the RWBY PJ party to go to some platinum party
Afina (Georgia🍀): So thank god the Air BNB crew was there cause we pulled her right in
Afina (Georgia🍀): Otherwise honestly I think she would've sat in the corner on her phone cause she's shy
Afina (Georgia🍀): What a jerkwad
Aldus (Jess): He's an asshole
Bill: Yup.
Elfriede (Tom): Oof, yep
Elfriede (Tom): Hate rekindled
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): OMG 😂
Aldus (Jess): *throws together that cosplay in 2days*
Aldus (Jess): I'd lend her my husband but 
1. Not the right version
2. She might get too excited
Afina (Georgia🍀): Rent-a-Tom lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also now that I've seen a real proposal at RTX I'm that much more angry about Ethan's fake one
Afina (Georgia🍀): That Ren and Nora that got actually engaged was PRECIOUS
Elfriede (Tom): Oh yeah I saw the video
Elfriede (Tom): It was adorbale
Elfriede (Tom): I'd be happy to rent myself out
Elfriede (Tom): But yeah wrong version
Elfriede (Tom): I bet she wouldn't mind tho lmao
Aldus (Jess): Lmaoooo I'll offer her a rate 😂
Elfriede (Tom): 3 snacks
Elfriede (Tom): Per picture
Aldus (Jess): You must feed him 3 snak
Elfriede (Tom): He protecc he attacc
Afina (Georgia🍀): Most importantly, he doesn't work without at least 3 snacc
Elfriede (Tom): **bare minimum**
