Nokri (Marisa): There’s a tweet going around that’s basically like “you want a cosplayer gf? Good luck having an always messy house”
So a girl posted this which is basically “my bf is a cosplayer and he made me a wedding dress”
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): It so pretty
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Ommggg
Bill: It’s beautiful.
Nokri (Marisa): Jess at tom:
“You’re a cosplayer now make me a wedding dress”
Aldus (Jess): But we're already married! 😭
Nokri (Marisa): Post-wedding dress
Nokri (Marisa): ~~rennora cosplay wedding~~
Elfriede (Tom): It is really pwetty
Nokri (Marisa): i was looking for pictures that probably don't exist of an old cosplay and i found what i think is an old otakon facebook group? but the group has a ship name and apparently was taken over by someone who kicked out the admins and made it political. something went down in that otakon facebook group.
Nokri (Marisa): how do you make a 2013-era cell phone picture that was uploaded to facebook look decent
can that kind of ancient image really be restored
Bill: Nope.
Afina (Georgia🍀): apparently ethan joined the coffee wars
Afina (Georgia🍀): but i cant see what half assed attempt he made to join in
Afina (Georgia🍀): _because then he would get mad_
Nokri (Marisa): do people get notifications if you screenshot their story
Nokri (Marisa): i can post it
Bill: Ethan doesn’t know who you are so...
Nokri (Marisa): ye but i don't want to screenshot it if it sends him a notification. he'd be like "who is this person screenshotting my story"
Bill: Instagram doesn’t do that. There were rumors they were going to start, but never happened.
Nokri (Marisa): if i had two phones i could take a picture of the other phone. that'd be sweet.
paranoia. paranoia all around.
Aldus (Jess): It was like "Dunkin, Starbucks, and Wawa all fucking  suck, black rifle coffee is the best"
Aldus (Jess): Lmao Marisa I was just thinking I could do that on Tom's with mine 😂
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): eyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Nokri (Marisa): smart thinking
Nokri (Marisa): why he gotta be so offensive
Nokri (Marisa): the epitome of straight white alpha male behavior
Bill: I can hear how small is dick is from here.
Bill: Always compensating for something.
Aldus (Jess): He's the straight white alpha male poster child
Bill: Yuuuup
Nokri (Marisa): i like how you can see meg's phone battery draining throughout her story
Bill: Is this V?
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): that's him that's v
Nokri (Marisa): i can't believe V likes vocaloid
Aldus (Jess): Can't believe V follows me
Bill: *You?*
Nokri (Marisa): it's because she got his good ending
Bill: I got the follower.
Aldus (Jess): Yea? I thought he did, he did at one point at least
Nokri (Marisa): you can only follow one person at a time. it's law.
Nokri (Marisa): there's a bot that follows me and unfollows me every day
Aldus (Jess): NVM maybe he unfollowes, or it was another V
Bill: I'm 2 away from 300 tho. I've been bouncing around 290s for awhile now, maybe it'll break.
Nokri (Marisa): WOAH mr photo famous
Nokri (Marisa): what will you do when you reach 300
Bill: *snrk*
Bill: The "bill of the south" has over 1000.
Bill: ~~I guess I'm the faker~~
Nokri (Marisa): is that you but evil
Bill: https://giphy.com/gifs/shadow-the-hedgehog-sonic-x-windiis-edits-11iuuKHFqILEU8
Bill: nah, some guy everyone who went to RTX met and did some photos with. Meg told me they called him the "Bill of the South" when he wasn't around.
Bill: ~~hopefully that means they aren't going to replace me~~
Nokri (Marisa): fight your double
Bill: Actually he gets about as many likes as I do on cosplay stuff.
Nokri (Marisa): that means you have to cosplay more than he does
Bill: cosplay *photos*, not being in cosplay.
Nokri (Marisa): that means you have to cosplay more than he does
Bill: Nope.
Afina (Georgia🍀): :3c
