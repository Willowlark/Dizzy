Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I mean I'm not sweating A2
Afina (Georgia🍀): I have a decent idea of how to do everything
Bill: Pyrrha ain't worth sweating either.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I ain't sweating y'all
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just figuring out where to procure my boobie holders
Aldus (Jess): Not yet maybe 😂
Elfriede (Tom): 👌
Aldus (Jess): Are u gonna make a suit from scratch?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Heck nah
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll use half what I already have and half whatever I buy

Bill: Yup.
Bill: Pyrrha must always Tiara.
Aldus (Jess): Just but some plain red ones silly butt
Afina (Georgia🍀): ARE WE STILL GETTIN SICK TEMP TATS
Aldus (Jess): Hell ye
Aldus (Jess): I think that's a really good idea
Afina (Georgia🍀): That'll be so cute 💕
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ok so Pyrrha needs a red top
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then she done
Bill: So Nier Friday afternoon?
Bill: for a getting everyone together.
Bill: like 2, same time as rwby group shoot.
Aldus (Jess): Is there a rwby swimsuit shoot?
Bill: Just rwby regular.
Bill: People will be in swimsuits though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like me!
Bill: Ye, don't stress needing regular cosplay.
Bill: Worst probably would be being cold outside.
Aldus (Jess): That's ok I wore 2b on February outside near the water
Bill: No shame == warm apparently.
Aldus (Jess): No
Aldus (Jess): I was not warm
Bill: I'mma say Nier shoot should meet in lobby, if the group is small we can do water park shoot otherwise abort to larger location.
Bill: For Nier I actually would love the outside pool area.
Aldus (Jess): Yea but who knows big it'll be open
Bill: they opened it last year for photos.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill you submitting for it now!
Afina (Georgia🍀): ?*
Bill: pretty much.
Bill: Well, is this like "Nier group shoot" or do we just put it on blast ourselves to keep it small?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah make it THE Nier shoot
Bill: Like 2B^2 part 2?
Afina (Georgia🍀): The more the merrier
Aldus (Jess): Yea big shoot
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg we're gonna find out who the faker gamer bois are

Afina (Georgia🍀): Someone comes up to jess like "hey I love your 2B your butt looks amazing" and Jess grabs me and goes "oh yeah, if you've played Nier WHO IS THIS"
Bill: Yes, submitting it now Georgia.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEEET when you make da event invite me

Afina (Georgia🍀): Facebook Events are half my ability to organize
Aldus (Jess): I feel like Adam would be less recognized
Bill: 
Bill: the fuck is that?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Well that's weird
Bill: I don't think CCE staff gives a fuck about those request forms anyway.
Aldus (Jess): That's odd
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe but it may also get put in the guidebook
Afina (Georgia🍀): I doubt anyone else is making a Nier shoot Friday tbh if we just wanna make a Facebook event and say fuck it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also side note if I really don't wanna be in cosplay Saturday for the RWBY shoot imma just put my Pyrrha shirt on
Afina (Georgia🍀): Casual JNPR shirts come so handy I tell ya
Bill: Why wouldn't you want to be in cosplay?
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHOOPS I mean swimsuit
Afina (Georgia🍀): If I don't wanna take group pics in a swimsuit
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause Idk self conscious or cold or some shit
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm doubting even bringing full Pyrrha tbh
Afina (Georgia🍀): It doesn't sound like the kind of con for it
Bill: Don't bother.
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's what I figured lol
Bill: Yeah, t shirt is a good idea then. Or a Jaune hoodie. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus (Jess): kinda a2-y
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOOO maybe
Afina (Georgia🍀): Definitely possibility
Aldus (Jess): its a cool suit anyway
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH I wonder how much titty support there is
Aldus (Jess): that it a good question
Bill: Dat nice.
Aldus (Jess): ok so i cant find a high neck white bikini top that look decent anywhere 😭
Bill: Team RWBY is now the most liked picture I've posted.
Bill: I give all the credit to Georgia and Leanna being in it.
Bill: ~~None to Snow~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): O wow it just barely beat shirtless ryan and electromagnetism tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Juuuust barely
Elfriede (Tom): I should really see those black buttons onto Adams sleeve to top off the Cosplay
Elfriede (Tom): But first I gotta replace 9s lost choker TwT
Bill: Does anyone else think Chris is much better as Qrow than the idea of him as Jaune or Ren?
Bill: I like his Qrow, I think he’s better suited to the adult characters than the students.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yo tom i actually found some like suede/velvet thats similar to that fabric you and jess have
Afina (Georgia🍀): i could just bring some of it to bills partay so you dont have to buy a new one
Afina (Georgia🍀): i was thinking the fabric would be good for A2 but it has no stretch
Afina (Georgia🍀): and yeah i dont see chris as qrow either
Afina (Georgia🍀): jaune maybe
Afina (Georgia🍀): ren no
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~tom and jess are the true ren and nora~~
Bill: Eeeeh. His Qrow is his best cosplay. He likes being Qrow and it makes a world of difference.
Afina (Georgia🍀): people cosplay what they wanna, but you make a valid point, some cosplays just dont work for some people
Afina (Georgia🍀): like i could never cosplay cinder
Bill: Yeah, it’s not that he can’t do it, it’s that he’s more comfortable being Qrow.
Afina (Georgia🍀): THO PRAISE GEN FOR GETTING HIM A WIG
Afina (Georgia🍀): idk my hopes arent too high for their pyrrha and jaune
Afina (Georgia🍀): they got like a month to build
Afina (Georgia🍀): which is about the same time i built my pyrrha but i also wasnt working a full time job or in school
Aldus (Jess): chris's qrow is good
Aldus (Jess): rens a hard character for average-large built men
Aldus (Jess): but people can do what they want ofcourse
Elfriede (Tom): I was thinking I was gonna use my faux leather for the choker
Elfriede (Tom): But idk maybe the material you have is better
Bill: ~~We’re all friends, we all know we support cosplaying whoever you want we don’t need to reinforce it~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill bring it just in case, worst case scenario you decide yours is better lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): I KNOW BUT I JUST FEEL BAD
Afina (Georgia🍀): like ethan i can make fun of his ren cause i dont like him
Afina (Georgia🍀): chris is a nice dude tho so i feel like i gotta soften the blow
Aldus (Jess): doesn't hurt to reiterate
Bill: I think he’s doing these for Gen too, which doesn’t help. I wanna know what he *wants* to cosplay.
Elfriede (Tom): Mmtay! Thanks 👌 🙏
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats true
Afina (Georgia🍀): im glad her break up with rob didnt ruin renora or snowbirds for her
Afina (Georgia🍀): it was kinda uncanny how rob was a good qrow AND ren
Afina (Georgia🍀): AND roman
Bill: He was better Qrow than Ren.
Bill: Tom is truly best Ren.
Bill: No bias, he nails it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): aesthetically idk rob is a pretty good ren
Afina (Georgia🍀): toms got the whole enchilada tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): AND the guns
Aldus (Jess): she wants him to do akane x kogami too
Elfriede (Tom): SOON THE DAGGER
Elfriede (Tom): THANKS THO ❤
Elfriede (Tom): Rob is a good ren
Bill: Rob is good, just saying he is my headcanon Qrow still.
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh ye tru
Elfriede (Tom): His qrow and Roman are super good tho
Bill: None can touch it.
Elfriede (Tom): Although Rob is a beautiful man so
Aldus (Jess): ive never seen his ren in person but in pics its v. good
Afina (Georgia🍀): rob is a beautiful man
Bill: Roman was really good too.
Afina (Georgia🍀): o wait rob had the guns too i forgot that whoops
Aldus (Jess): yea rob is good looking

Elfriede (Tom): Might be dude heavy just cuz periods suck
Aldus (Jess): whoa thats some next level shit

"have fun being up all night moaning in pain in fetal position foo"
Afina (Georgia🍀): my biggest complain is probably getting sexualized or hit on
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause some people are mad weird about doing it
Afina (Georgia🍀): side note, alriiiight one new pyrrha shoe down one to go
Afina (Georgia🍀): these have a bigger heel and also have velcro so the cuffs stop spinning around throughout the course of the day
Aldus (Jess): YEA thats too

Bill: ~~I get the in the gut I understand~~
Bill: Women do get more options in clothing, particularly dress clothes.
Aldus (Jess): oh yea dat tru
Bill: Guys it’s a suit, just removing pieces as needed.
Aldus (Jess): ive feel for my coworker when its like really hot out and if the ac isnt working cuz ill wear a skirt
Bill: Wouldn’t say I’m jealous of the option (without Georgia Shorts ™ I dunno how you could wear a skirt) but it’s definitely a perk to some people.
Aldus (Jess): longer skirts i have no problem not wearing shorts under
Aldus (Jess): ~~wait why does georgia get the crdeit for that?~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause without them i think id have more panty shots
Afina (Georgia🍀): this ho doesnt close her legs for pics WHOOPS
