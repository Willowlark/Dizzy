Bill: <@!351471675843411978> <@!245270932602486784> I haven‚Äôt heard from the chatterbox guy. You probably need to order the dress tomorrow to get it in time Jess, I dunno if you want to do it anyway or skip it. If I don‚Äôt hear anything tomorrow morning I‚Äôll try calling over there.
Bill: Georgia we‚Äôll have to explore back up plan tomorrow.
Aldus (Jess): Yea I'm still kind of unsure ü§î
Bill: Time to play 'how many followers does Andrew get from a plug by *me, instagram... existing tlt_wm?*
Nokri (Marisa): i think people gaining followers from a plug is a myth
Nokri (Marisa): andru count for science
Bill: ~~he's at 54 right now I checked~~
Bill: It's not if your InStAGrAM FaMoUS WeZrEZ COsPLaY.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): :>
Nokri (Marisa): my net total this week is -5 followers but i think it's the random car companies and stuff
unless car companies just really like cosplayers
also some guy in a V cosplay but the icon cracks me up each time i see it so i hope they stay
Nokri (Marisa): would anyone ever be interested in doing a masquerade skit
Aldus (Jess): ~~what's their pic?~~
Aldus (Jess): that sounds neet but id be terrified
Aldus (Jess): surprisingly alot or my rwby followers also like mm and vise versa so that good
Nokri (Marisa): it's 100% normal so i don't know why it's funny
they have a lot of cute mm pics on their thing
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): ye maybe because all my costumes are vastly different, i don't stick with one fandom
Nokri (Marisa): come jess we can masquerade isshou ni
Nokri (Marisa): we can do a rwby/mm skit
Aldus (Jess): ~~shine dance when~~
Nokri (Marisa): like these guys
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45b2dXc_HR0
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): whooo
Nokri (Marisa): I KNOW IT WE CAN DO THE SHINE DANCE I LEARNED IT WHEN I COSPLAYED PYRRHA ~~i can do ruby in the background~~
Aldus (Jess): omg that would cool, but id prob mess up and die
Bill: you prerecord audio.
Aldus (Jess): nah rwby can shine too
Aldus (Jess): mess up the dance silly
Nokri (Marisa): yeah all audio is pre-recorded and there's a rehearsal 
it's ok i've horribly messed up on stage before at otakon people just cringe and move on
Bill: Marisa: a better Pyrrha because she knows Shine? More at 11.
Nokri (Marisa): no my pyrrha sucks
Nokri (Marisa): i can never be Wezrez‚Ñ¢ Cosplay‚Ñ¢ the irl pyrrha
Nokri (Marisa): what would be a good rwby skit tho ü§î
Bill: *Topple the monopoly!*
Aldus (Jess): i will be background character
Bill: ~~Nora doesn't do background~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~I hate hearing audio of my voice with a passion~~
Aldus (Jess): BUT JESS DOES
Bill: If it's a musical skit, you'd probably use the source material.
Nokri (Marisa): you can also edit your voice in a software
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Bill: *Hack your voice*
Nokri (Marisa): depending on what the audio is you can't use it, like you can't use audio from an official dub or from the actual show
Aldus (Jess): *hackerman*
Nokri (Marisa): but music is usually ok
Nokri (Marisa): we could do a 707/unknown/ray/rika skit
or 707/unknown/rika/mc
707/unknown/ray/mc
endless combinations owo
Bill: Ray/MC/Rika: *Just an orgy on stage*
Aldus (Jess): D:
Nokri (Marisa): that's not allowed stop that
Aldus (Jess): na thats V/Rika/MC
Aldus (Jess): and Ray outside like "omg are you girls ok?!"
Nokri (Marisa): whatever we do it's gotta involve an on-stage outfit change
on-stage outfit changes are cool
Aldus (Jess): üò±
Nokri (Marisa): like this
such an iconic skit
so wonderful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao7GS7uUDsw
Nokri (Marisa): half the video is just the crowd going wild
Aldus (Jess): thats what Georgia's transforming skirt is for
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): RWBY TRANSFORMATIONS
Aldus (Jess): ill be the preson who holds up the heart
Nokri (Marisa): you'll be the one who backflips through a paper heart we hold up
Aldus (Jess): üò±
Aldus (Jess): i have spent exactly 1:30 seconds of my entire life on a stage
Nokri (Marisa): great you've got plenty of experience
Elfriede (Tom): Oof
Elfriede (Tom): All 4 fasion shows?
Aldus (Jess): yea XD
Aldus (Jess): ohh technically it was a little more cuz i modeled for aliza too
Aldus (Jess): ~~in her awesome lolita dresses she made the literal night before the show~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~god shes be an amazing cosplayer~~
Nokri (Marisa): we could try going for a sad angle with dead pyrrha in the middle and team rnjr around her
zenkai had one like that a few years ago that was the voltron cast crying and going "we miss our space dad pls help us find him"
Bill: One of those guys sole job was to slam a butt bow on sailor moon.
Bill: Good gig.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): NICE
Aldus (Jess): Coworker on phone: "hello this message is for Nora"
Me: "me?"
Nokri (Marisa): the only rwby skit i can think of is jaune sitting on stage with a guitar playing "nice guys finish last"
Bill: ooof no.
Nokri (Marisa): are you not entertained
Aldus (Jess): Ren walks in "can't relate"
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): OH  rwby skit that uses bits of audio from "do it for her" from steven universe
maybe too much of a stretch tho
Nokri (Marisa): yeah too stretch too much of the song would be cut out or altered
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> <@!351471675843411978> Chatterbox guy isn't getting back to me.
Bill: Have to shelve Fallout for Jess's brother's farm or the run down diner in ledgewood.
Aldus (Jess): okey dokey
Bill: Andrew got a follower! Ha! Am I famous yet?
