Aldus (Jess): Since <@245270932602486784>  out up her katsu line up I'm trying to think of mine? Not sure if I'm feeling rwby 😮 I do wanna show off my hammer tho 🤔
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Jess with a Hammer
Bill: Well, if you guys are doing Nier I'd want to get a shoot in with all three of you.
Bill: and maybe get Leanna as welll.
Aldus (Jess): as 2b?
Bill: No, as Adam.
Aldus (Jess): look butt face you dont have to be sarcastic
Aldus (Jess): should I maximize for friend coordination
Bill: Yes, 2B and 9S.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): *ooooooooo* shots fired
Bill: Do you want to do shoots with friends/events? Or do you want to show off your own thing, get hall shots, or generally wander?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ((biru when i decide on a 90% finalized schedule lemme know if u have any interest in shooting any characters because i'll likely start scouting for photogs asap))
Aldus (Jess): ALL
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): that might murder him
Bill: ~~9 costumes for just Marisa is a lofty goal~~
Bill: Remember that Marisa is *insane* at cons.
Aldus (Jess): no i mean i wanna do all those things
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): anything i pay for won't be more than 30 minutes, most will probably be 15, but i'd also be willing to pay for any shoots you do
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): YEAH JESS WANDERING AROUND WITH A HAMMER BEING MAJESTIC
Bill: Will do tho. I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail at 'taking it easy' at Katsu. I may *despise* the crowds and general atmosphere of Katsu, butttt I want to do photos cause it's fun.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): wander wander, pose, wander to a photoshoot and be the star of a gathering. that's jess's schedule.
Aldus (Jess): i want photoshoots but i dont know any photogs and i dont wanna drop mad cash and im awkward with new people, and i dont have a line up
Bill: *cough*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i know some photogs but i think the ones i'm most familiar with are mostly dormant or retired now.
<:lenny:395307171539189760>
gee if only there was one still active with reasonable rates
Bill: Figure out your line up first.
Aldus (Jess): you just said u wanna take is easy thooooo
Bill: Oh and nice of you to offer Marisa but you know I'm not going to ask you for money right?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): jess i pretend to be a photog i can take ur picture
Aldus (Jess): YAY
Bill: ~~Exclusive Whoozica cosplay photographer tlt_wm~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): we have us a fancy photoshoot
i will pay. if not with cash then with stuff.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): u wanna see my bad portfolio. i've been meaning to add to it.
Aldus (Jess): i know rebecca too, am comfortable with her
Bill: We'll see what I do.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): imma do that now while eating my donburi
Bill: Like if no one's really doing RWBY I'm not going to bother with the Hazel thing. I don't personally care that much, it just felt like it'd be fun to do it with everyone.
Aldus (Jess): i wanna do rayla but im afraid there will be 900 raylas
Bill: Be like, Callum. No one will be Callum.
Bill: Also fuck other people, do the cosplays you want to do.
Aldus (Jess): hell no XD
Aldus (Jess): ill just put rayla and 2b in the same day so i can be basic the whole day
Aldus (Jess): ill so Nora and Mina so i can be crazy one day, and then Rayla and 2b so i can feel inferior all day, and MM whenever lol
Aldus (Jess): also i can only wear 2b for like an hour before her shoes kills me rest in peace me
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): you gonna body paint your face for mina? body paint stuff is usually best for at the end of a day and/or last day of a con
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): photobucket is so horrible omg i knew it's awful but now it's just. utterly atrocious.
Aldus (Jess): 😮 i was def gonna do her on the tail end of a day at least
Aldus (Jess): OH WAIT
Aldus (Jess): <@!184437198865563648>  were staying sunday night right?
Bill: It's booked yeah.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): are we?? :0 so thursday through monday?
Bill: We have two rooms thursday through monday.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): woaaaaaah
Aldus (Jess): OOOOOOOOOOOOOO I CAN PLAN MORE COSTUMES THEN
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): that sounds so weird
Bill: Last year we decided to stay through monday (at a different hotel) so we didn't have to drive up after the exhausting Katsu.
Bill: I have that monday off from work too, so it's a neat thing.
Bill: Now we have the sunday night in the gaylord so we don't have to fight the elevators.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): really? :0
I know a bunch of people do it. i've gone down on wednesdays. or even tuesdays for otakon to help set stuff up.
it's just gonna be so weird being at the con but *no con*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): probably lots of staff lingering though. about 60% of zenkai's staff stays for free until monday
Bill: ~~when all the people leave I might actually be willing to go to the fucking gazebo~~
Aldus (Jess): and ill still have my staging area, so i dont have to worry about going tot he car and stuff
Aldus (Jess): YEA GAZEBO
Aldus (Jess): whooooo
Aldus (Jess): from the preliminary talk yesterday, it seems like alot of friends are doing bnha friday?
Bill: Yeah.
Aldus (Jess): the photoshoots seems like a mess tho, like multiple each day idk
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): my sd card of the last few cosplay events is corrupted rip
time to back up what files i have left on that card
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): is there any good free online storage that's bigger than google drive or dropbox
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): are there multiple bnha gatherings each day? wot
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oh. google drive offers 100gb for $2 a month though. that's tempting.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): rowan e-mail has unlimited free storage. *dumps all my cosplay photos there.*
Bill: Flickr.
Bill: Flickr gives you a terabyte of photo storage.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): but that's public isn't it
Bill: They have private galleries.
Bill: It's album setting.
Aldus (Jess): like i searched the events at katsu on FB and got like so many bnha results i dont know whick is da truu one
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: BNHA is the hip thing so everyone and their mom will be running something,
Aldus (Jess): marisa asked if there were multiple gatherings i was just answering her question
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): thank
Aldus (Jess): the one at 12:30 on friday seems popular
Aldus (Jess): oof how long does body paint last
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): depends! can last all day.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): sometimes i'd be picking grey off my hairline for several days.
Aldus (Jess): ooo ok cuz if there is like a pj party later i might want it on from like noon till after a pj part if there is one
Aldus (Jess): hi my names jess i like the stress about everything
Aldus (Jess): like if i get up early enough i can coud squeeze in nora on friday morning but man i dont like walking up
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oh hey i have a portfolio on flickr lol
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): good job past me
Bill: Early is really the only time to shoot indoors though.
Aldus (Jess): i dont actually have a hard time walking up earlier at a con, if im not the only one doing it, i have more a hard time getting moving tho
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): is anything in this album visible
https://www.flickr.com/gp/149364684@N02/42p57K
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): jess we can be early bids at con
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): wake up rise and shine
Bill: Yeah, it's visible.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): thank
Aldus (Jess): yea das visable
Aldus (Jess): dems good
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): pls critique. i know they all need more saturation.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): disappointed my sd card conked out and i lost everything recent
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): o dis one of my faves from 2 katsus ago
https://www.flickr.com/gp/149364684@N02/y35U11
Bill: You want that to be your portfolio Marisa?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): it's all i have probably
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): everything is scattered on hundreds of memory cards and sticks and old computers from over the years
Aldus (Jess): i like dem
Aldus (Jess): i like the ryoko one das neat
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): thank but i must improve. gotta bop bop bop bop to the top
o ye that was a weird shoot because they kept telling me what to do and what they wanted to do was always opposite of what was best for the camera <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *I HAD THAT HAPPEN*
Bill: Fucking Chameleon whatever at Katsu.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): omg what were they cosplaying. what stuff did they make you do.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): like, "take my picture right here where it's half shady and half sunny." or "point your camera *at the sun*"
Bill: Eh, it was Katsu and I was already so shot from the crowds I gave up and took the crappy ones, suggested a few good ones, gave her the good ones.
Bill: For a portfolio you don't need so many images. I'd say pick the top 9.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): also this merida like. never gave me her contact info. we spoke through tumblr i think? yeah. and this was before the messaging system existed so I asked her "where do you want me to send these pics?"
I asked a couple times and tagged her in a post in case the asks weren't going through. no responses ever.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): gotta use **all the pics**
Bill: Marisa, I return 20~30 images most shoots.
Bill: I take close to 100 at most of those shoots.
Aldus (Jess): mina has comfy shoes big plus 🤔
Bill: ~~I'm already over a month behind on everything in my backlog, can you image?~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): me too tho. i promise at least 20 pics back per shoot. i take about 4k to 5k at a casual con. the photog struggle.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): behind on backlog? **take more photos**
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): look it's tom and jess
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): look it's tom and jess
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): tfw u try to make a post and it ain't posting
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): rip
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): there it go <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: and if you're still storing photos on sd cards get them off sd cards. Sd cards are super unreliable.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): my life is sd cards
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): can you have sub-albums in flickr. probably nto
Bill: Get an external hard drive (flash drives are too small IMO, but if it works it works).
Bill: And I think Flickr would work well for you, even to store the stuff you get back.
Bill: no you can't.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): my flash drives all cop out too because they're the super cheap ones hehe
Bill: you can create collections of albums.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): yeah storing stuff is what i primarily need. i don't want to lose the photos i've paid for.
Bill: flickr.
Bill: *get your photos somewhere safe or so help me*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): can u not upload images directly to an album. uguuu this sucks
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): *uuuuuuuugh*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): o got it
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i look so bad in so many pics ; u ;
Bill: Hush.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): nance gave me this because i "look cute" but i am ready to devour souls
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): akko needs major improvements
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): biru do u wanna shoot jess and i's (and tom's? is he unknowning) mystic mess
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): OH I CAN DO JAEHEE WHILE WORKING AT ZENKAI
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): im thinking either well all be saeran or ill be mc, and he can be be suit boi
Aldus (Jess): which would u perfer?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): either is fine!! it'd be awesome to have an MC and then super cool to have suit boy. seven could work too but i can't see as many picture possibilities for seven/ray route ray and saeran.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): triple baka JUST came up in my playlist though. just now. that is a sign.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ah fudge. i sort my folders by character and then by photog. flickr doesn't have good ways to organize that hnnng
Aldus (Jess): mmkay ill see if tom is willing to be suit saebae and ill be ray rout mc ~~and you guys can fight over me~~
Bill: I'd say see if you can get Georgia to do MC again, but I doubt she'd have time. *maybe* sunday?
Aldus (Jess): i see, georgias a better MC 😭
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): alternative option: i'll dress as MC and we can do a 3 person MC shoot
Elfriede (Tom): Baka baka baka
Elfriede (Tom): ***aggressive cellphoning***
Aldus (Jess): thomas! are u ok with being suit saeran, so i can be MC? or do u wanna be unkown real bad
Aldus (Jess): i think the pics will be pretty co either way
Aldus (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  come bacccckkk
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): if we stay until monday does that mean we can bring monday costumes <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): or is monday a no-cosplay day
Aldus (Jess): def a no cosplay day XD
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): *cosplay jaehee on monday because it's super casual*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i'm making one flickr album just called "mistakes" for the worst of my worst costumes
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i loathe the pics but i paid like $40 for them
Bill: No Jess, so you can get more Mystic Messenger characters in at once, duuuuh.
Elfriede (Tom): Doesn't matter to me babe
Aldus (Jess): WHOOO now you can be EVEN EDGIER
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oof. one of my faves raised her photography prices. my kokoro.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): though her otakon ones were way more expensive than other cons?
Bill: who?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Depth of Light. she did my neon and my selkie shoots
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): eyein' her up for katsu. these were her rates last year which aren't bad
Bill: Yeah, they good.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): fudge. i can't find the girl who did my katara pictures. those were great too.
depth of light has really nice work and she made sure i didn't skate into traffic or down a flight of stairs as neon
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): GOTEM they changed their name but they've been on hiatus from cons since 2015 oops
Aldus (Jess): oh noooo
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i do not recommend sumiko photo at all. at least i had a horrible experience with them but i know they're big in the cosplay community.
Bill: Rebecca knows here.
Bill: I'm blanket unimpressed with the work.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): maybe it was just bad timing. the guy doing the pictures was exhausted (it was a duo or a trio? they were so overbooked. i had a guy taking my pics) and he hadn't had a break all day and it was night.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): my cosplay also sucked *but*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): just a combination of me being awful and an exhausted photog with no light
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): all the pics basically look like this lol it's a horror shoot
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): emcp is a creep but he did take good photos
Bill: Yeah... I don't think she flatters rebecca in her photos.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): munchkin photo was nice but very blunt lol. she said i was chubby and had to suck in my gut hehe
Afina (Georgia): Marisa if you matchin up at any point with me I’ll do ALL the photos with you 💕
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): YEAH it would be an honor to take photos of / be in photos with the honorable state of Georgia
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): [goes back 2 check ur list]
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): if there's a bnha pajama party i could bring Tsuyu
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): rolls up to the 18+ bnha pj party in this

Bill: ~~urge to assert dominance as BNE photographer rising~~

~~*Even if that's petty and stupid*~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i have 14 folders left to upload and a bunch of scattered files but. that can be done later. stay strong until then, sd card.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): are there any more super easy yet obscure series we gonna do, like moutele?
tomo-chan?
Bill: lol Tomo.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> wanna be Toda again?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): [bad fanfare music plays] yay backup
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): cosplaying webtoons would also be fun like refund highschool or hooky
Bill: NICE
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oo and subzero is getting featured on the 22nd.
Bill: There is way too much going on today.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): put it all down and throw it out the window *it's time to talk about cosplay that won't happen for ages*
Bill: ~~what do you think I'm referring to?~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): w...work? owo
Bill: All the cosplay stuff lol
Bill: Katsu plans, Zenkai, ANYC...
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): えええええええーーーーーーーー
Bill: I have work stuff too, I just don't want to miss anything.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i still have scars from comiket but i added some makeup to my amazon cart so i can cover em up if needed
Bill: why do you have scars.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): from cosplaying
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): 👍
Bill: *Marisa*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): that's me!
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i have a line on my arm from when i cosplayed my shirt while i was wearing it lol

Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ironed* the shirt
