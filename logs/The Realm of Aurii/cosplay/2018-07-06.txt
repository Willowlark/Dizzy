Afina (Georgia🍀): and the fandom is kinda immature in some senses with their... I don't even know how to explain it other than it reminds me of Homestuck
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like at Zenkai a lot of the Voltron peeps were 14 y/os there that wanted the "hot yaois"
Aldus (Jess): NICE
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then there's normal people like you and Gen who watch lol
Elfriede (Tom): yeah
Elfriede (Tom): they are all just young mainly
Bill: It's a fad fandom.
Aldus (Jess): all fandoms are fads to an extent
Aldus (Jess): if they keep making seasons itll stick
Elfriede (Tom): i get what you mean though with the fandom feels immature
Elfriede (Tom): you almost feel to old for it
Elfriede (Tom): but only cuz of the fandom
Elfriede (Tom): if you had your own group of older peeps it wouldnt be as bad
Afina (Georgia🍀): Jess let's just get shutter shades and wizard beards and be hot party wizards in bikinis
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's an idea
Bill: 👌

Bill: Just picture it though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): *takes off flip flop* am I sexy now
Bill: Like, *look at these abs* pose (so Kamistry breathing), but you're just like 😑
Bill: Making it super awkward, looking right into the camera.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh yeah I guess you need pose lists rather than shipping shots
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause this is a fandom that's actually not massively overwhelming to shoot
Bill: I mean, I don't have one of those yet. I'm making a normal call list.
Bill: Namely to have a medium of order to the ship calls.
Bill: ~~None of which have cool names~~
Bill: I was thinking we might need some themed shots tho.
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): A2 and 2B
Aldus (Jess): Oh nvm

Aldus (Jess): I mean I wouldn't go to crazy I doubt alot of these are gonna show up

Bill: Or rather, that is it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh boy now to finish route C and figure out how to pose with tom and Jess yeehaw
Bill: You finished B?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like, if emotions weren't prohibited, 2B and A2 got some sexual tension
Afina (Georgia🍀): That, I also have to finish that
Bill: Start with that.
Bill: *And make sure you are at a minimum live chatting C*
Bill: It's kinda just to have in case, The ships are the ones that *should* happen no matter what if the characters are present, the crack ships can get requested.
Aldus (Jess): 2b and a2 don't really interact that much thou?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no don't say that 😭
Bill: They have one important interaction for sure.
