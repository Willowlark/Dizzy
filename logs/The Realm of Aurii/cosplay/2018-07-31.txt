Afina (Georgia🍀): NOPE it didnt even budge
Afina (Georgia🍀): so this strategy is super good
Afina (Georgia🍀): plus the armor piece itself is proportioned better for my thighs
Afina (Georgia🍀): AND its completely sealed in the back
Elfriede (Tom): Oo nicu👌 👌
Elfriede (Tom): Ye sounds better overall
Nokri (Marisa): why are the simple cosplays the hardest
i can buy full and elaborate costumes for $5, i know 5 different wig stores i can get to in less than 15 minutes in case i need a last-minute wig (one of which is open 24/7), there are entire shops dedicated just for cosplay makeup or cosplay props, and yet i can't find a blue headband and some kid's craft foam. I can find a huge roll of cosplay-specific prop foam but i literally just need like 3 inches.
Nokri (Marisa): suffering
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: Speaking of your cosplays, we (I) bragged about you at Georgia’s birthday, what with your 9 new cosplays every Con.
Bill: *24/7 last minute wig store*
Bill: Why Japan.
Nokri (Marisa): who would want to hear about my grossness
dont exaggerate i usually cap myself at 4 new costumes for a con at max
~~i may have required that 24/7 wig store once. they also sell maid and schoolgirl uniforms.~~
Nokri (Marisa): unless i can buy most of the costume then there might be more than 4.
Nokri (Marisa): i just updated my list it made it to 3 pages
Aldus (Jess): D:
Nokri (Marisa): now color coded to show how bad my addiction is.
Nokri (Marisa): i might give alibaba to paula if it fits her because then we'll have all the main characters of magi for comiket yay
Nokri (Marisa): i did a photoshoot for cassie's group once and they had every magi side character i wonder if they'd let us join them and form a mega magi group 🤔
Aldus (Jess): single spaced too DAMN
Bill: the fact that you still have access to like 90% of these outfits is insane.
Aldus (Jess): you're amazing
Bill: ~~Also why have you only cosplayed the fetish outfit sabers~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~how is school uniform bad~~
Aldus (Jess): cuz they easier?
Bill: ssh, that's the reason but I'm teasing.
Aldus (Jess): isnt saber like all armor?
Bill: Nah, not entirely.
Bill: But enough it's effort to make.
Nokri (Marisa): i didn't want to make saber's armor hhh that's a pain. i do the easy versions
Bill: ~~but the whole point of the white dress was to play up Saber as a sacrificed virgin or some shit~~
Nokri (Marisa): but look how fun she look
Nokri (Marisa): it was just a simple thursday cosplay to wear in line
Aldus (Jess): she gettin married?
Aldus (Jess): one day ill wear my wedding dress for cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): naw she gettin' sacrificed
Aldus (Jess): D:
Nokri (Marisa): ye!!! i have a love live wedding cosplay we can do idol brides
Aldus (Jess): nuuuuuuuuuuu
Aldus (Jess): i never seen that but thats okay
Bill: you can try and join Audrey's idol group.
Nokri (Marisa): what idols they doin?
Nokri (Marisa): i think every idol series has a wedding costume version
Nokri (Marisa): BoJo bought me a photography backdrop for my birthday, like a portable green screen but with a generic white background for photography. i can set that up and take saber selfies <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Edgy.
Bill: Ron gave me 3 of those, but they’re colored for like, school portrait backgrounds.
Bill: They came with all the spare dslr so I said please and thank thi.
Aldus (Jess): OMG we should take school portraits
Nokri (Marisa): when we doin' a japanese-style cosplay photoshoot day
we all go somewhere with like 10 costumes and spend all day getting photos
i bring my camera and gopro
Bill: Which I still need another compact flash and a compact flash reader if I’m bringing them to Chestnut Hill.
Nokri (Marisa): US-style school portraits in cosplay pls
Bill: Ew but sure.
Nokri (Marisa): they have to be purposefully horrible too just like reality
Aldus (Jess): i think it would be great XD
Bill: Whenever Georgia and I do shoots we spend 3 hours and still don’t finish the outfit we shooting. So spending all day works.
Aldus (Jess): "please take off your glasses"
"but no one will know who i am"
"please take off your glasses anyway"
Bill: Beacon yearbook photos.
Bill: !!!
Bill: Actually. That’s not a bad a idea.
Nokri (Marisa): whaaa
rose and i went to a studio and I brought ffffour costumes? if I remember correctly. we left after about 5 hours
Aldus (Jess): or:
"everyone with glass please so to the end of the line and wait 3 hours"
Nokri (Marisa): discrimination
Bill: We can make a “yearbook” for the chestnut hill shoot.
Aldus (Jess): actually did mr chicken used to do school photography?
Bill: Like, a literal one.
Bill: Oh yeah. Tons.
Aldus (Jess): haha yeaaa maybe thats why i thought  he looked familiar
Bill: He taught graphic design and photography at... mt olive.
Bill: his backdrops are huge though. I can't get them in the trunk.
Bill: Not that I know what the plan is for that weekend and cars going there.
Nokri (Marisa): ask them nicely if they'll fit
Elfriede (Tom): MARISA 
Oh wait nevermind I thought it was a Google.doc
Elfriede (Tom): I was scared that I could edit you cosplay list
Nokri (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
erase everything and just put "loser" <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): Why would I do that <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): top comedy
Elfriede (Tom): You are too precious to do that to 🙌 🙅
Nokri (Marisa): do it for the vine
Nokri (Marisa): I have my overly shiny wig and fake glasses that I can’t see anything out of woo
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): what color are your regualr glasses?
Elfriede (Tom): Like nya 😺
Elfriede (Tom): Ah yes the wig that looks like your normal hair just less dark
Nokri (Marisa): real glasses are also red <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): but a darker red
Nokri (Marisa):
