Aldus (Jess): product review: "this bathing suit rode up alot"

Elfriede (Tom): PERFECT
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: You just get your cultists to fight Georgia for you. Don’t worry, she can spawn RWBY cosplayers for defense.
Aldus (Jess): "If you're insecure about your butt cheeks hanging out, this is not for you"
Aldus (Jess): great i found the perfect suit for 2b

Bill: > A2 and 2B square off
> suddenly 2 dozen people in unknown cosplays that are clearly based off Jess’s unknown photos and not actual mystic messenger show up
> *Defend lady Whoozica*
> meanwhile another dozen fan girls of mystic messenger are drooling off to the side over the unknown knockoffs all dressed as 7 cause you know they are
> Georgia be like *gasp*
> RWBY cosplayers appear, Tim has mini gun that fires grape vodka.
> Jenna shows up, goes *uwu*
> half the rwbies turn on Jenna and take her out back to be murdered
> RWBYies outnumbered. Jess can’t wrangle cultists. Georgia grimaces. 
> Georgia goes grey scale, horns grow from head
> Georgia calls upon the ancient forgotten art of homestuck summoning
> homestucks flood the con
> no one is safe. 
> They find Jenna drowned in grey face paint with myemehmeh in her gut
> the seven fangirls are cradling the wounded cultists, who can’t escape they’re fangirl grasp
> Tim is on the last remaining bar stool, everything else is on fire. Including his drink. 
> Jess and Georgia are standing together watching the water park burn down
> ...

> *Still a better ending than Life is Strange*
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Aldus (Jess): biru get back to work
Afina (Georgia🍀): Who records it for the vlog tho
Aldus (Jess): tom probably
Aldus (Jess): since apparently not even he is on my side
Bill: I’m out getting lunch. And why wouldn’t he be on your side?
Bill: ~~Also why is he playing Tekken what~~
Aldus (Jess): he went home
Aldus (Jess): got bored of being alone so he took a half day
Afina (Georgia🍀): Big mood
Aldus (Jess): hmmm wait if i get a high hip suit then im going to have a visable  tan line 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nakie tanning?
Aldus (Jess): 😮 how do that? i mostly tan in publis like when im swiming and stuff
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like a private tanning place!
Aldus (Jess): ooooo that spence
Aldus (Jess): unless get black card for planet fitness but meh idk
Aldus (Jess): will weigh pros and cons of high hip bathing suit later
Bill: Wouldn’t you just need to tan in that bathing suit?
Aldus (Jess): yea but i dont wanna wear that suit all summer D:
Aldus (Jess): the stuggle is real
Aldus (Jess): ill just wear spf 100 and re apply it every 2 hours and get no tan at all 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lather on sunscreen to stay pale lol
Aldus (Jess): YE
Bill: I can only think of two people here... One, 2017 me was right, two... Poor Leanna.
Aldus (Jess): WHAT WHO?
Aldus (Jess): what does 2017 you know that i do not?
Bill: I said way back when Erik had a crush it was Leanna. This would be going the other way, but it's believable.
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Bill: The other... well, Ethan and Casey are at it again, so... I guess the disaster isn't happening.
Aldus (Jess): oooohhhh spiccycycyccyy
Bill: *casually asks if Erik is up to anything this weekend*
Elfriede (Tom): HMMMMMMM
Elfriede (Tom): 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
Aldus (Jess): he in her profile pic oooooooo
Elfriede (Tom): Ya know
Elfriede (Tom): i think thats semi likely
Elfriede (Tom): MAYBE THATS WHY LEANNA HUNG OUT WITH ETHAN
Elfriede (Tom): just put up with him
Bill: !!!
Elfriede (Tom): for the Eric booty
Bill: *He cosplays Blake*
Elfriede (Tom): *shit*
Aldus (Jess): OMG tru
Elfriede (Tom): i think its actually likely
Bill: *As we know from Georgia, cosplayers cannot date someone who does not cosplay their ship partner*
Elfriede (Tom): hmmmm
Aldus (Jess): and tie lol rip
Bill: ~~Doesn't stop Georgia and Hal~~
Aldus (Jess): exactly
Bill: My only reservation is the 'meeting her friends' thing. If we're assuming her other core friends are cosplayers, he's likely met them...
Eliran (Halim): ~~that's why I'm hung out with Ethan~~
Aldus (Jess): to get to erik?
Aldus (Jess): jk jk
Eliran (Halim): Yes
Aldus (Jess): i dont blame you
Eliran (Halim): I wanted a big spoon for once
Aldus (Jess): yaaaaaaas
Eliran (Halim): They're really hard to find
Aldus (Jess): im asuming you meant you hung out with ethan to hang out with georgia
Elfriede (Tom): LMAO
Elfriede (Tom): NO ERIC FAM
Bill: yea, I mean, say your cute thing too bud.
Bill: *But I reeally want to know who Leanna asked outtttt*
Eliran (Halim): I mean yeah I hung out with him for Georgia
Aldus (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

Bill: That's not even the gif I want.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😮
Afina (Georgia🍀): /checks back on the nier poll every hour to see if im the only A2 still
Aldus (Jess): wow whats that like 😂
Bill: There aren't that many of anything Jess, jeez. Relaxy.
Aldus (Jess): bra
Aldus (Jess): there were like 25 2bs last year there ARE that many
Bill: There's an equal number of 9S and 2B right now, Tom just hasn't voted.
Aldus (Jess): i mean if there are gonna be no adams....
Aldus (Jess): he should prob do adam, RIP the kissing photos
Bill: eeeeeh, Tom is best 9S.
Bill: Also the only male 9S.
Bill: Unless Kamistry comes outta the woodwork.
Afina (Georgia🍀): You could get hate kisses :V
Bill: ~~More like hate choking~~
Bill: *I'm not kink shaming, it's just what happened last year!*
Afina (Georgia🍀): >->
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm patterning out A2's tattoos in the car
Afina (Georgia🍀): This is gonna be INTERESTING
Aldus (Jess): Hard mode
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think I got a way to do it
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm just gonna have to wear essentially a full body pair of tights
Afina (Georgia🍀): And have someone with a really steady hand paint them on
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or I'll sucker a sister into wearing them while I do it lol
Aldus (Jess): Yea that's what I was thinking
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm just trying to pattern out the lines for stuff now
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~do y'all got any A2 nekkid fanart cause I need to honestly see how the lines continue up her body for a swimsuit~~
Bill: Nope.
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): Lmao
Bill: ~~is safe search on~~
Aldus (Jess): Haha ya
Aldus (Jess): I turned it off but I hot the same thing
Aldus (Jess): I added neir and now I am being throughly disturbed
Aldus (Jess): Ooo there's the same sakimichan art but more nekkid
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): _not enough plate lines_
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Found this tho
Aldus (Jess): Moving to nsfw *nyoom*
Bill: Dats just a nice A2.
Elfriede (Tom): i feel like most nude fanart of a2 has her just with skin so it doesnt help
Bill: It does, commented that in bobbies.
Dave: thought i was going to be emil
Bill: Nah, but bucket robot.
Bill: Be
Aldus (Jess): but emil would be sweet tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Both

Afina (Georgia🍀): Zelda you can do solo for sure
Afina (Georgia🍀): There's a lot of Zelda lovers out there
Aldus (Jess): nah, not swimsuit
Afina (Georgia🍀): I guess it depends on which outfit-theme you use to inspire you
Aldus (Jess): honestly it doesnt feel right since i nver even finished botw
Bill: The head piece from a few of the games would be recognizable with the ears.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The ears and hair are pretty trademark tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Touché
Bill: Oh right yeah, BOTW wouldn’t be recognizable.
Afina (Georgia🍀): You'd wanna cosplay any other RWBY girls?
Bill: Unless you drew on MEGA eyebrows.
Aldus (Jess): nah not swimsuit at least
Bill: ~~suffer as Pyrrha~~
Aldus (Jess): it wouldnt be suffereing if it was swimsuit silly
Afina (Georgia🍀): O rly I thought Blake would be right up your alley tbh
Bill: I didn’t say swimsuit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): With that KAWAII ASS BOW
Bill: Oooh, that would be neat for Jess.
Aldus (Jess): yea blake was my og fav
Bill: *Youd have to bat Leanna off with a stick*
Aldus (Jess): but im not really keen on 2 cosplays from same series in one weekend
Afina (Georgia🍀): Me, cosplays RWBY three days straight: I feel that
Bill: But Blake’s v4 outfit is just asking for swimsuit cosplay.
Afina (Georgia🍀): You wanna be seven? 😂
Aldus (Jess): im too picky 😅
Bill: That top is perfect for a bikini.
Aldus (Jess): nah i aint even attempting that
Afina (Georgia🍀): What other media you like? Any videogames or animus in particular?
