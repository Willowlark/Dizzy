Aldus (Jess): So the stain from my makeup on my Nora shirt isn't coming out, im trying one more thing but im not going to be home tomorrow into Saturday to make a new one and I'm not up to it tonight.
Nokri (Marisa): What the stain made of? 😱
Aldus (Jess): Foundation 😭
Nokri (Marisa): Have you tried makeup removing wipes and anti-grease dish soap
Aldus (Jess): I tried makeup remover, dish soap, bleach and shout
Nokri (Marisa): Wow I’m surprised the shouting didn’t work
Aldus (Jess): Lmfao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Fus ro DUH
Afina (Georgia🍀): Huh stain is still there
Bill: 😢
Aldus (Jess): Yea so I'm kinda at a loss on what to do? Like I ahve to wash it again to find out if what I did will work but I won't be doing that till Saturday afternoon
Aldus (Jess): Even if it does come out I still have to out the insert back in to make the heart shape hold and bleeeh
Nokri (Marisa): Laser removal
Bill: Fabric paint maybe?
Bill: Or, to heck with it. Be V and focus on the photos.
Aldus (Jess): Maybe? I feel like that would be even more obvious and then the stairs
Bill: I wouldn’t know, honestly.
Aldus (Jess): But then we won't has a Nora 😣
Aldus (Jess): Unless there's another coming
Nokri (Marisa): The other Nora is just a cardboard cutout of a picture of jess in her Nora costume
Aldus (Jess): Yea there we go!
Bill: There isn’t, but we already don’t have Jaune.
Bill: So JNPR RNJR aren’t happening.
Aldus (Jess): Nah I'll be there, my shirt might be either stained or not canon but I'll be there
Bill: Ooh.
Bill: So you have to redo the shirt anyway.
Bill: Why don’t you own it and make a battle damaged shirt.
Aldus (Jess): Either way I have to out some work into it
Bill: True, but ruining it has to be easier than fixing it. 😛
Aldus (Jess): It the stain comes out I still have to put the cardstock in that use to make it Stand up, if the stain doesn't come out I have to remake it
Aldus (Jess): Eh I think it would look weirder to have a pristine outfit with just a banged up shirt
Bill: Marisa and Georgia might have a way to damage the skirt and jacket.
Bill: Non permanently.
Aldus (Jess): I could just wear the white shirt, no cut out which is why I said non canon
Aldus (Jess): Na I wouldn't want to do that
Nokri (Marisa): Battle damage is actually weirdly difficult to do. You could light it on fire and drive over it with a car but that doesn’t always work well. Controlled brushing has the best effect.
Aldus (Jess): Yea I'm not into it. Not when everyone else isn't doing the same, it would just look like Nora doesn't know what a washing machine is or smth
Bill: Tom, put makeup on Ren’s pants!
Aldus (Jess): Ew no then I'll have more work!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Weird question but would your swimsuit top work? 😂
Nokri (Marisa): Cosplay quote challenge but Ray’s quote is just “*uncontrollable sobbing*”
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooo morning mist had plans to cosplay Pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): Interestinggg
Elfriede (Tom): Hmmmmm
Elfriede (Tom): Do I smell copycat<:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOOH TOM I WASNT EVEN THINKIN BOUT THAT BUT YOURE SO RIGHT
Elfriede (Tom): Oof
Aldus (Jess): I might be able to use swimsuit top. And wait how is she a copycat?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah we're just being conspiracy theorists
Elfriede (Tom): Ye <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooo she also has Raven on her COSPLANS
Aldus (Jess): TT raven or RWBY raven?
Nokri (Marisa): ~~or rune factory raven~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): TT
Nokri (Marisa): another harvest for the eventual raven rainbow
Afina (Georgia🍀): She actually put "do you believe in destiny" so I guess she could be cosplaying Cinder too
Nokri (Marisa): next person to cosplay raven has to do this version

Aldus (Jess): PLZ
Nokri (Marisa): u gotta
Afina (Georgia🍀): A2 wig out for delivery OH YEA
Bill: 🙌
Elfriede (Tom): Whew
Afina (Georgia🍀): tom and jess, what kinda material is your 9s and 2b cosplays made from?
Afina (Georgia🍀): like a kinda stretch almost suede type material?
Elfriede (Tom): Yrah
Elfriede (Tom): It's interesting
Bill: hmm. What are you doing for the clothes part of A2 Georgia? You've only really talked about the tights and lines.
Afina (Georgia🍀): sewing presumably lmaooooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): would you describe it as a heavy fabric
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause i have two options, heavy suede and light suede
Elfriede (Tom): It's ... Probably heavy
Elfriede (Tom): Although not cumbersome
Aldus (Jess): its pretty heavy
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://spandexworld.com/c3/catalog/product/17398#product-attributes
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://spandexworld.com/c3/catalog/product/11720
Aldus (Jess): ooohard t tell which one it would be
Aldus (Jess): i think for a2 youd prob wanna do light, i think 9s and 2b are heave cuz their outfits have to hold a certain shape
Aldus (Jess): a2s doesnt cuz its skin tight
Bill: and if you think about it, the belly part of her shirt is that almost sheer material.
Bill: so it's definitely on the lighter side.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ones 90/10 polyester/spandex
Afina (Georgia🍀): the other is 95/5
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i think im gonna go light for more stretch
Aldus (Jess): yea saw that, dont hink itll mke much difference in the end but id do with the lighter and stretchier
Afina (Georgia🍀): it recommends this material for work out clothes what?
Afina (Georgia🍀): who works out in suede lmao
Aldus (Jess): right? lmao
Bill: oh, you thinking of doing the cheer group Georgia?
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah i just wanna see what everyone else does
Bill: sounds about right.
Afina (Georgia🍀): though if im free i may dick around and be football yang or something
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause thats just a funny idea to me
Bill: Facebook be like "Look Georgia's doing this cosplay group" and I be like "I'd know if she was <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>"
Afina (Georgia🍀): HELL YEAH
Afina (Georgia🍀): bill has the 411
Bill: Doesn't Leanna want to do that?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think it was me that suggested she do that
Aldus (Jess): NOW THATS AN IDEA
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause that was my initial reaction to the event
Aldus (Jess): ~~nora doesnt strike me as a chearleader either~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH
Afina (Georgia🍀): NORA YANG FOOTBALL
Afina (Georgia🍀): i have one free cosplay slot for katsu so im gonna see what ill do
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill keep on eye on rwby 3.0
Aldus (Jess): WHOA whats your katsu line up
Aldus (Jess): i dont have one yet whoo!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Pyrrha/??? on friday
Afina (Georgia🍀): A2/Lux Saturday
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ann Sunday
Bill: Pyrrha, A2, Lux...
Afina (Georgia🍀): though theoretically lux is interchangeable
Afina (Georgia🍀): shes an armor build tho so i have a slight preference for satruday
Afina (Georgia🍀): A2 is definitely saturday cause ill have BIG SWORD MCSMACKYOFACE
Aldus (Jess): oooo neat
Bill: Boy I hope everyone doesn't pull out awesome stuff at Katsu that I want to shoot, because shooting *sucks* at Katsu.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😅
Aldus (Jess): thats kinda the whole thing at katsu tho
Aldus (Jess): like thats the "premiere your new shit" here don
Bill: yeah but it's hellish to do photos indoors, it's *so* overcrowded.
Bill: Too many people premiering new shit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause katsu is totally over capacity with its venue
Aldus (Jess): yea but thats not how people see it
Bill: It's going to be different for the cosplayers anyway; cosplayers want photos and attention and for alot of people to see their work.
Bill: It's me who wants a photo without a troupe of love lives in the background.
Bill: I'm going to make myself miserable at Katsu, I mean, I know it already.
Bill: I'd be more miserable refusing and not taking photos of everyone's hard work, just doing nothing while I'm there than stressing decent photos.
Aldus (Jess): i have one(1) plan for katsu so far
Aldus (Jess): after CCE ill see if i wanna try something more daring
Bill: ~~darling~~
Bill: 😛
Aldus (Jess): 1. I havent even seen that
2. I mean build wise
Bill: I know, if there was a typo it would have been funny so I faked the typo.
Afina (Georgia🍀): What is katsu plan 😮
Bill: Mystic Messenger.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mys messsss
Bill: Ray x Ray x Ray ~~orgy~~.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Owo nicu
Aldus (Jess): ~~technically its ray, saeran, and unknown~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Weeee shooould do teen titans sometime next year too, that cosplay thing had be thinking about that
Aldus (Jess): like we're not all wearing pink suit here
Aldus (Jess): YEA I WANNA DO THAT STILL
Aldus (Jess): i can get it together p. easy if i have a goal date, i just work better with deadlines lols
Afina (Georgia🍀): i was thinkin zenkai -w-
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause my summer cons are highkey limited by internship
Afina (Georgia🍀): and this is one of those cosplays thats a lot less fun alone
Bill: Otakon is a few weeks earlier btw.
Afina (Georgia🍀): so i saw
Afina (Georgia🍀): hue gen got the same color and style clip that i got for pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): nice 😏
Aldus (Jess): yea we can shoot for zenkai!
Bill: Ryan didn't go last year, but if he does maybe he'll bust out beast boy for you.
Bill: Since Tom doesn't want to embrace the body paint/homestuck.
Eliran (Halim): Ill be robin or nightwing
Aldus (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Eliran (Halim): Which version btw
Afina (Georgia🍀): teen tootans
Eliran (Halim): Which titans tho
Eliran (Halim): Movies or tv show
Afina (Georgia🍀): tv tootans
Bill: ~~the only one anyone will recognize~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~the less skin showing starfire~~
Bill: ☝
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe i should do volume 4 yang............ i dismissed the idea before but im thinkin bout it
Aldus (Jess): ~~also i dig the casual titans so if u ever wanna do that with me~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): we could do casual on a thursday!
Bill: or for a day con.
Bill: There's a few of those in the year.,
Aldus (Jess): ye or a sunday
Eliran (Halim): 
Eliran (Halim): Both of these are v recognizeable
Eliran (Halim): And im not sure which is technically showing more skin
Bill: The point is not *that one*.
Eliran (Halim): Wait nevermind 2nd doesnt have boots she wins
Bill: and everyone recognizes the tv show because it's the only DC property that was popular.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think that starfire qualifies for NSFW chat tbh thats how much skin that is
Bill: good point.
Aldus (Jess): YE
Aldus (Jess): LOL
Bill: but the points been made.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~it was the only DC property that was GOOD so i hear~~
Eliran (Halim): False
Eliran (Halim): Young justice was bangin
Eliran (Halim): Also the DC animated movie universe is p good
Eliran (Halim): Also justice league unlimited and its affiliated shows
Eliran (Halim): DC has really solid animated shows
Eliran (Halim): Static shock anyone? Also all of the batman's
Bill: ~~I'd agree but some people here like DC ☝~~
Aldus (Jess): yea ive heard those are good!
Eliran (Halim): Theyre all great, at least as good as teen titans
Eliran (Halim): Id say Young justice is a clear step above
Aldus (Jess): yea my coworker liked it alot
Eliran (Halim): ~~its also another property that got shortened because to many girls liked it just like teen titans~~
Bill: ,... what?
Aldus (Jess): YUP i read about that
Aldus (Jess): the intended audience was boys but they got too many girls watching it so they were like "opps wrong demographic" or someshit
Eliran (Halim): Basically they want to sell toys right
Eliran (Halim): But they market to the bois
Bill: I got it Hal.
Aldus (Jess): girl not allowed to like super hero
Elfriede (Tom): Ryan's a better beast boi 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): _excuses_
Aldus (Jess): youd makes a great BB if you wernt afraid of body paint
Bill: 
Bill: I don’t have the heart to comment you looked even better in person on the post. 😆
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHEEZES GINNY NOTICED ME
Afina (Georgia🍀): Georgia in the 50s is getting good feedback 🙌 though I did lose a follower
Bill: *Alright maybe I do a little bit*
Bill: That mean we should do more you shoots? :3
Eliran (Halim): OH YO
Eliran (Halim): So my old karate teacher is super into magic
Eliran (Halim): The gathering
Eliran (Halim): Sent me this message earlier
Eliran (Halim): 
Eliran (Halim): And hes serious about knowing the dude
Afina (Georgia🍀): _you get paid to cosplay?_
Eliran (Halim): Like hes realllllyyy big into magic
Eliran (Halim): Potentially id have to make a really solid costume first
Afina (Georgia🍀): are they literally just asking you to be a cosplay model and stand there at the tournaments?
Afina (Georgia🍀): is this REAL?
Eliran (Halim): Basically? From the sounds of it 
I make a good cosplay, come to hang out during some small tournaments and get get some extra exposure. 
Then i can snowball up from there
Afina (Georgia🍀): H U H
Eliran (Halim): Real talk
Eliran (Halim): I did not think this connection would come back around likr this
Bill: “For exposure” is sort of a buzz word for “scam” in art tho...
Eliran (Halim): From anyone else id say the same thing
Eliran (Halim): But this dude is my former karate teacher
Eliran (Halim): Who is so christian and straight honor based
Eliran (Halim): That even after the person who owned the studio ripped him off
Eliran (Halim): When people wanted to go to him for private lessons or just mutual practice  he wouldnt out of respect
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~also halim wants to be there anyways lets be real~~
Eliran (Halim): Yeah i love mtg too xD
Eliran (Halim): Though i dont think my decks are tournament quality
Eliran (Halim): This dudes helped me get into other stuff before hes reliable 
Not scammy 
Also tbh id be adding a whole new fanbase to my cosplay
Eliran (Halim): And its a devoted and big one
Afina (Georgia🍀): of Ma G I c nerds
Bill: I’m not trying to attack his character, promise. I was big into magic a few years ago, and this info may be outdated, but I’m remembering the pro tour word finals for Magic. Specifically, the fact that it looked like they barely had the budget to afford a camera to stream with. Wizards does not strike me, in past things, as a group willing to spend money on cosplayers who stand about. There’s very little money in tournaments as well with Magic as well. Product is the usual prize. 

I’m saying that if the monetary angle is important to you; get all the information before investing hundreds in a show quality cosplay. Magic outfits aren’t simple, even Jace’s edge lord hood will be an investment. I just don’t see, again, based on what I’ve seen, not new info, anyone in Magic paying a cosplayer.
Bill: I’m all for you adding magic to the cosplay portfolio tho. Magic has GREAT designs.
Afina (Georgia🍀): d a m n
Afina (Georgia🍀): good thing rwby aint like that phew
Eliran (Halim): Lol yeah i dont trust wizard as far as they can throw me
Eliran (Halim): I was menti9ning it cause i was wondering 
Would anyone wanna magic cosplay with me now i have a convenient excusee :3c
Bill: RWBY isn’t paying you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): not meeeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): but they did some cosplay collabs at RTX
Bill: Hit up Tristan for magic cosplay.
Bill: He’s big into it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye its like half his insta
Eliran (Halim): Mmmm nah
Eliran (Halim): I dont like tristan and magic 
Like mad respect for what he does with it 
But its too intense and he plays the way i hate
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~cheap?~~
Eliran (Halim): Hes one of those "instant death" deck types that kills the game
Bill: Cosplay isn’t play tho....
Eliran (Halim): Nah but the way he approaches magic as a whole is what bugs me
Eliran (Halim): Idk how to describe it
Bill: He plays combo.
Eliran (Halim): Im fine with him outside of magic but in it nah
Eliran (Halim): I dont wanna deal with it
Eliran (Halim): I dont mind if we both cosplay magic and hang
Eliran (Halim): But like i dont want to set up a magic pair with him
Eliran (Halim): Like 
I wouldnt want to do a specific cosplay group with snow in rwby 
Like i wouldnt want to do rnjr with her
Eliran (Halim): But if we getting a large group together or theres a bna rwby cosplay meet up id hang out with her
Eliran (Halim): Or id hang with her in another context to
Eliran (Halim): Cause shes not somebody id want to do a close cosplay group with?
Eliran (Halim): Idk how to explain it
Afina (Georgia🍀): agreed
Eliran (Halim): When it comes to tristan and MTG thats kinda how i feel
Bill: That’s about Snow’s person, not about how she opinions on Ruby.
Eliran (Halim): Yeah but its not tristans opiniond on magic
Eliran (Halim): Its how he approaches and acts around magic
Eliran (Halim): Thats a person thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): people can be kinda different in diff enviornments too
Afina (Georgia🍀): tristan could be annoying when playing magic because he instakills and doesnt make the game fun
Afina (Georgia🍀): even if hes a blast to play overwatch with
Eliran (Halim): He plays a boring game
Afina (Georgia🍀): kinda like how georgia in cosplay has a lower patience threshold than regular georgia lol
Bill: He can be. But not wanting to spend time with him one on one because of the way he does magic is more about him as person than the game. My old roommate played a 80 counter spell deck in edh. He was a dick with magic, but I still roomed with him.
Eliran (Halim): Yeah thats what i said
Elfriede (Tom): He plays to win and only win?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^^^^
Bill: ~~Sneasel deck~~
Elfriede (Tom): lmao
Elfriede (Tom): forgot about that
Eliran (Halim): I dont like how be behaves when it comes to MTG as a whole
Elfriede (Tom): i didnt know sneasel was broken to be fair
Bill: I’ll never forget.
Eliran (Halim): Infect proliferation decks tho
Bill: And we were playing in a busted manner. Pokémon is only supposed to play one set at a time.
Bill: What I want to know if it’s just magic or somewhat him as a person. At Otakon he asked if he could room with us at Katsu, as he has no one else to room with.
Afina (Georgia🍀): nah hes just awkward
Afina (Georgia🍀): hes a good dude
Bill: I’ve thought so.
Afina (Georgia🍀): he comforted casey when she showed up to katsu post break up
Eliran (Halim): Cause he crushes on her
Bill: Better him than Ethan.
Eliran (Halim): Almost anybody is better than ethan
Bill: And while I didn’t tell him yes, I lean yes as we aren’t full at all at Katsu.
Afina (Georgia🍀): he also does fill for overwatch
Afina (Georgia🍀): which i know means nothing
Afina (Georgia🍀): and yet
Afina (Georgia🍀): it means something
Bill: The only think that gave me immediate pause was he said “I don’t mean to guilt or pressure you; but if I can’t stay with you I won’t be able to go at all”. Poor choice of words, probably. But it struck me the wrong way.
Eliran (Halim): Ew
Eliran (Halim): That is a really bad way to say it
Afina (Georgia🍀): he recognized that austin was a cuck and kicked him out
Afina (Georgia🍀): i swear hes a good persoonnnnnn
Bill: I believe it Georgia.
Bill: No worries.
Eliran (Halim): He did that after austin seriously fucked him over tho
Bill: Like I said, I want to know if it’s magic or Tristan Hal doesn’t like.
Eliran (Halim): Not sure at this point
Bill: That’s all. Not worrying about Katsu till after CCE. Long after CCE.
Eliran (Halim): Most of my interactions with him were surrounded by magic -.-
Bill: Mmkay.
