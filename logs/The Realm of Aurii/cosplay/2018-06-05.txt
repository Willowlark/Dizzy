Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): >finds PERF Lux fabric but not sure if it's enough (I need two yards)
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): >lady rolls it out, exactly 2 yards
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Boom luck counter
Bill: !counter georgialuck add 1
Dizzy: The georgialuck count is now 7!
Aldus (Jess): üôÑ
Bill: Hey, don‚Äôt knock positive luck. Me and my bad luck sure.
Dave: so when the LoL cosplay happens, imma need a lot of help getting this wig to work
Aldus (Jess): ~~luck is bullshit. And perspective~~
Aldus (Jess): Anyway we gotchu Dave
Bill: ~~I have a negative perspective then~~
Aldus (Jess): time to make a packing list finally
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Yo I'm about to go out and get fuckin bullied, morningmist has gotten like 300 followers in the last week
Nokri (Marisa): wot
hacks
~~who's morningmist~~
Nokri (Marisa): 2 more until 200 forever :3
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: :3c
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): tom we can bully each other to get more followers believe me its an excellent idea
Nokri (Marisa): elementary school says bullying is wrong
what if you get reported
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): ill shit talk on my story
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): tomukuns boobs are fake boom
Nokri (Marisa): omg that's social murder
Nokri (Marisa): the fanboys will go rabid
Nokri (Marisa): that would be a funny april fool's day thing.
"hey guys wezrez here i'm actually a dude"
photoshop some HUGE muscles and abs on yourself
Nokri (Marisa): do you still need new versions of pyrrha to cosplay because
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Ah muscle fetishes,they sure are something
Bill: Pity followers are not he good kind of followers we were talking about Georgia.
Bill: And Casey has taken a public stance of support for Mist. Wonderful, at RTX Mist will be bodyguarded by her and her entourage. If Mist is as innocent as she says she is, I dunno, but I know Jake does a lot of policing for Casey and Casey isn‚Äôt an idiot, so that speaks for something. 

I do not put it past Snow to want her Instagram famous friend wezrez to help her out, or throw you under the bus in some way as shit hits the fan. You‚Äôll be in an extremely political situation, I‚Äôm worried for you. Be careful with the lot of it.
Nokri (Marisa): What‚Äôs the deal with mist what‚Äôs the 411 what‚Äôs the skinny
Nokri (Marisa): New phone who are these people
Bill: I gotta leave for work, if someone else doesn‚Äôt get you the deets I‚Äôll share them.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Apparently there was just this whole cycle of bullying between morningmist and crescentbladed
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): And all their friends seem to have gotten dragged into it
Aldus (Jess): Not surprising
Nokri (Marisa): Oh nooo
Nokri (Marisa): So why is that bad for you? Are they bullying you because if so I shall bully them
Bill: I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs going to get pulled in.
Aldus (Jess): ye its a bog ol drama clusterfuck
Nokri (Marisa): Fight the power 
I would assume if she doesn‚Äôt say anything about it she won‚Äôt get pulled in. In an ideal world
Nokri (Marisa): I just walked past someone in Lolita
People who do Lolita coords are hardcore so if you get dragged into the fight get some Lolita coorders to back you up
Aldus (Jess): fight fight fight
Nokri (Marisa): Lolitas will absolutely wreck things up
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Nani
Nokri (Marisa): lolita irl:
Nokri (Marisa): another example of irl lolita behavior
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): ~~nah thats me~~
Nokri (Marisa): jess has the heart of a lolita: confirmed
Aldus (Jess): üò≠
Aldus (Jess): noooooo
Aldus (Jess): ~~i just like to draw pictures and drink~~
Nokri (Marisa): georgia if someone tries to mess with you send them this
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: Yes, send them a picture of Marisa.
Bill: None one's going to directly mess with Georgia though, it's more she's the shoot runner at RTX and the shoot at RTX is where Mist and Snow are most likely to duke it out.
Nokri (Marisa): be sure to film it
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Ruby v Weiss: wrestle mania smackdown
Aldus (Jess): do you think they actually physically fight?
Aldus (Jess): girls fights are brutal
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Nah there's no waaaay
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: And mess up their cosplays?!
Nokri (Marisa): the strongest cosplays are battle functional
Aldus (Jess): im not hip on the drama lingo. what is doxxing?
Bill: I had to google it.
Bill: releasing private information publicly without consent.
Aldus (Jess): ooo like phone numbers and addresses and shit?
Bill: In Mist's case it was her phone number, yeah.
Nokri (Marisa): o yeah doxxing someone is basically
"hey guys xXxNoobxXx420's real name is Joe and he lives at 69 Meme Street in California and works at Sears"
Nokri (Marisa): does releasing a phone number count as doxxing too
i've only ever heard it used to refer to name/address/place of work
Bill: It's pretty fucked up.
Aldus (Jess): ughh i cant do drama
Aldus (Jess): i just shut down
Bill: This is mean girls level of drama.
Bill: Not that I've seen that movie.
Nokri (Marisa): it's such a classic though
Bill: Pointing being, stay out of the disaster zone.
Nokri (Marisa): i think it's on netflix
Aldus (Jess): dont have to tell me XD
Nokri (Marisa): this is it this is instagram drama
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVN7TJRRskQ
Aldus (Jess): too true
Aldus (Jess): "if someone says something bad about you, you'd wanna know right?"
"no"
Aldus (Jess): ME
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Idea for everyone: just get rid of all the toxic people in your life and live a drama free life~
Aldus (Jess): im too old for that shit. I try my best to stay 9000 miles away from it
Bill: Snow's just part of a group we're all in, we can't cut her out of that. Beyond the group no one cares for her.
Bill: Mist lives in Atlanta, we're just following the insta shit.
Nokri (Marisa): it's really easy to impulse buy costumes here I've already bought 2 this week please stop me
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: UNDERSTANDABLE
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Ah gotcha. Just like a piece of advice I've been living by lately
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: But thyey cheaper right?
Bill: They're like, what, 10 bucks?
Nokri (Marisa): bring me back to the US where we pay for cosplay in blood
Nokri (Marisa): ye
Bill: That's like saying buying a soda from a vending machine is an impulse buy.
Nokri (Marisa): i bought saber's school uniform and kuriyama mirai since i've cosplayed from both of those series before. was gonna get a love live (yume no tobira dress) but decided against it because that song is meh. they were $20 apiece. saber could've been cheaper but i figured i was already there
Nokri (Marisa): there's a suzaku costume i want for $15 (knight of rounds uniform) but it's an XL so it might be too big
~~maybe i should buy it anyway and just take it in~~
Bill: hell, ship it to Tomu.
Nokri (Marisa): TOM U WANNA BE SUZAKU
Aldus (Jess): ~~code geass squad when~~
Bill: not that he could wear an XL either.
Nokri (Marisa): it's missing a piece, i think the inner shirt but that's easy peasy, and it doesn't have the cape but capes are easy
Aldus (Jess): tom is stilla  small/medium even in asian sizing
Nokri (Marisa): i have no idea how sizes work here
sometimes medium fits me but I usually go for large and those fit
Nokri (Marisa): code geass squad when
Nokri (Marisa): who's gonna cosplay what
Bill: You three are the only ones whove seen it I think?
Nokri (Marisa): have you not seen code geass
Bill: I have, I just don't cosplay. :V
Nokri (Marisa): that's a staple. a classic. i've seen it 5 times
Nokri (Marisa): be orange
Nokri (Marisa): i want to cosplay CC as Zero but that mask would be a pain so maybe. not.
Aldus (Jess): ~~one day i will be tom's ultimate waifu~~
Bill: *Tom bleed out via nosebleed*
Aldus (Jess): actually thats just my excuse to eat pizza hut all day
Bill: *Tom starts bleeding from ears*
Bill: *"My wife... is my waifu...? My waifu... my wife?"*
Bill: *Tom's head explodes*
Aldus (Jess): I have everything for this version now:
Aldus (Jess): cut thats like super basic
Nokri (Marisa): Âúü„ÅÑÔΩî
Nokri (Marisa): Oops
Nokri (Marisa): Do It
Bill: she going to. Tom needs Lelouch doe.
Bill: ~~Or maybe she already has for Tom~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): could do it this weekend if i reaaaally wanted to but ill prob save for colossal since thats naked con
Aldus (Jess): no actually lmao
Nokri (Marisa): look at these prices hhhhhh
Nokri (Marisa): it's a shame all the ones i want are costumes i already have
Aldus (Jess): i wanna do this outfit http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0808/7195/products/Commission_Request_Code_Geass_C.C_Cosplay_Costume_CP178678_1_grande.png?v=1484297107
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH that a cool outfit
Nokri (Marisa): i wanna do this one but there was a girl at katsu who absolutely nailed it a few years back
Nokri (Marisa): there was a little incident at the code geass shoot but overall it was ok
Aldus (Jess): üòÆ
Aldus (Jess): bonus: if i cosplay CC i have another use for my expensive yellow contacts <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: ~~The ones you can't see out of?~~
Nokri (Marisa): a younger girl (obviously teen or pre-teen) was dressed as CC I think and one of the Lelouch's went too far posing with her. I can't remember if she just felt uncomfortable posing or if he kissed/nearly kissed her but she wound up in tears. the lelouch wasn't trying to be malicious and was super apologetic, I want to say he even asked for permission first although i can't recall 100%
Aldus (Jess): i can see just not as well as normal contacts
Aldus (Jess): AHHH üò≠
Aldus (Jess): das sad üò¶
Aldus (Jess): i can only cosplay yellow eyed, green eyed, or light blue eyed characters accurately cuz contacts are expensive as hell for me <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): ye it's the girl on the left (that lelouch next to her isn't the one who made her uncomfortable it was an emperor lulu)
Nokri (Marisa): forgo contacts
utilize photoshop <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): hmm i wonder how old she was
Nokri (Marisa): the katsu code geass shoots are awesome
Nokri (Marisa): i want to say like maybe 12 or 13 or so
Aldus (Jess): oh wow
Nokri (Marisa): but she wasn't with anyone she was by herself
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Wooooo CODE GEASSSS

Bill: How old is Snow?
Bill: And her Facebook is gone too.
Eliran (Halim): She's at least 21
Bill: Worried about Leanna now... Particularly that Snow dropped her like a sack of bricks. I think my asking would come off nosy but maybe asking Erik to check on her...
Aldus (Jess): id let it go for now
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Idk the extent of the drama, but I would suggest not getting too involved with it unless it directly affects you. I would hate to see any of you be stuck in the drama too
Bill: Drama girl is the one who ghosted out. She just got together with Leanna though. I‚Äôm only concerned Leanna got hurt.
Bill: As a side effect.
Bill: But you are right Jess. We‚Äôll see her at Next.
