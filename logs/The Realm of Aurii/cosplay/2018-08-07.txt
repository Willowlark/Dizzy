Nokri (Marisa): i was looking for something
and i found this
and it's really funny because i look extremely nervous
Bill: I think that was my photo!
Nokri (Marisa): ye!! credit @TLT_WM (Trees Lay Tiny Warring Minefields)
Bill: Throwback, kotori’16 isn’t uploaded anywhere anymore.
Bill: So that’s *exclusive* woo.
Nokri (Marisa): it's on the facebooks yehaw
Nokri (Marisa): collector's edition
Bill: I deleted that album I thought.
Nokri (Marisa): i think that was the con i was falling asleep at and spent like 90% in the photoshoot room because kat was proposing to her gf or something
Bill: Never mind it was still up there.
Nokri (Marisa): *don't delete it*
Nokri (Marisa): rare
Bill: I hate deleted most of the cosplay stuff when I started the Facebook page, cause I moved it there.
Bill: I left a few things behind though. Not sure what the logic was.
Bill: ~~throwback to doing one album per con, if I did that now there’d be thousands of images per album~~
Nokri (Marisa): shoutout to looking for my rwby boots, being unable to find them, making new ones out of stilettos that murdered me in my sleep, and then finding my shoes immediately after the con in the first place i looked <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): what if i just gave out really depressing valentines day cards at katsu as ray. like, "i'm worthless trash that deserves nothing unlike you the radiant sunshine of my life. lets drink elixir and spend the rest of our days in Paradise."
Nokri (Marisa): bad idea but amusing concept
Elfriede (Tom): Yes and yes
Bill: People are going assume you’re giving out actual drugs.
Nokri (Marisa): Why would they assume that that’s illegal
Bill: Drink elixir
End up in paradise 
Sounds like Ecstasy to me.
Aldus (Jess): They could be in the shape of his little magenta heaet too!  I was thinking of doing some of those for my mm cosplays
Bill: He was drunk pretty much the entire time I knew him what?
Aldus (Jess): Lol but that ok
Bill: true. Aaaand facebook doesn't exactly mean 'remembers'.
Nokri (Marisa): gasp. i have a purple wig and a violin and this uniform. also i can't play the violin. i can make this happen.
Aldus (Jess): DI IT
Nokri (Marisa): YOU BETTER GET READY TO DIE 🤘
Elfriede (Tom): WOOOO
Elfriede (Tom): Yo those pictures <@288513265661902858> <@245270932602486784> did have such good mood holy shit 👌👌
Elfriede (Tom): So many good set ups
Aldus (Jess): from rtx?
Elfriede (Tom): Ye, the dude released a second set
Aldus (Jess): nicu
Bill: both of them were yesterday.
Elfriede (Tom): I didn't see the second <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): YE Sam really wanted to shoot a couple
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I was like "well I have some good news for you"
Nokri (Marisa): that sounds violent
Bill: Did you every look at the website Georgia?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nani?
Bill: Go look at my site.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOOO SOLE SHEVIVOR
Bill: There you go.
Bill: Don't forget the portrait tab.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The bike picture, did you filter that or was the lighting really just THAT 50s???
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause that really looks straight outta the 50s
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also might you be able to send me the color version of this one?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~unless I look bad, in which case ignorance is bliss~~
Bill: The lighting is just that 50s. Lesson learned, vintage filters aren’t from filters that were popular back then, it’s just how old lighting looked.
Bill: Yeaaaaah the counter ones had a lot of splash light that made for weird color spots.
Aldus (Jess): it was also due to the type of film
Aldus (Jess): it was never intentional obviously
Bill: Yup.
Bill: I can show you later.
Bill: The trick to making that photo work will be fill flash. Just to deal with the tinted ambient light.
Bill: And using the grey card.
Bill: I figured out how to use that in post and GOD it’s a blessing.
Bill: Or the other counter, actually.
Bill: Tom/Jess, now that Georgias seen em, take a look so you can see what kind of photos you can get.
Bill: We didn’t do nearly enough with the counter, but the staff came in.
Bill: I’ll start a dm with Leanna later.
Aldus (Jess): mmkay
Aldus (Jess): <@!245270932602486784>  are you and hal cosplaying saturday? and if so, what?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably wooby
Afina (Georgia🍀): I was thinking Yang
Afina (Georgia🍀): I could bust my butt to finish Yona but I'd rather not
Aldus (Jess): okey dokey
Afina (Georgia🍀): You and Tom got any ideas? ;3c
Aldus (Jess): Probably MM for Saturday cuz the panel that's day I just gotta figure out which characters 😂
Aldus (Jess): I'll cosplay MC cosplaying 707
Bill: Rip Yona.
Aldus (Jess): A look™
Bill: 70C
Aldus (Jess): Low key actually considering it tho
Bill: You just need Tom shirtless as 707 running after you trying to get his shirt back.
Bill: Or Tom as 707 in MC clothes.
Bill: Since apparently clothing swaps are a requirement for *gey af* couples.
Aldus (Jess): Omg that would be adorable
Aldus (Jess): But he look so good as unknown
Aldus (Jess): Sheet
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH SWITCH CLOTHES
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): SWITCHING CLOTHES IS DA BOMB
Aldus (Jess): Why are MM cosplays so easy
Bill: Cosplaying what you hate huh.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Arda has 10% off wigs tomorrow at 10 am
Afina (Georgia🍀): Gonna buy dat A2 wig
