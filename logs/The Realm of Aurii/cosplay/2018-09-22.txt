Afina (Georgia): I got this Instagram analytics tool that my sister showed me
Afina (Georgia): It turns out that a majority of the time, when people “unfollow” me, they actually just delete their account entirely
Afina (Georgia): And to think, all this time I thought people unfollowed cause they didn’t like my content 🤔 when in reality 60-70% just delete their IG
Bill: Follower count still means nothing~~
Bill: I’m... also not sure that data can be extracted.
Afina (Georgia): It just says who unfollowed me recently
Afina (Georgia): And clicking on their username, if it no longer exists, it means they deleted
Bill: Hmm. Maybe then. I’ve looked at instagrams api, they’re really hard to get data out of.
