Nokri (Marisa): Omg jess can we do a hiyori photoshoot together
Like. Conscious and unconscious hiyori. 
If you don’t have a tail you can borrow my tail but I wanna plank on the ground (or we can take turns)
Nokri (Marisa): NICE SORD
Nokri (Marisa): careful. you could puncture the hull of an empire-class Fire Nation battle ship, leaving thousands to drown at sea. because it's so sharp.

Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~drink? is drinking a hobby?~~
Bill: As we found out yesterday, none of us can quite do a real party atmosphere.
Bill: As for non party atmosphere, you guessed it, 50+ year old men drinking bourbon. (They’re cool tho.)
Afina (Georgia🍀): cosplaying is a 20-something hobby isnt it?
Afina (Georgia🍀): by photographing cosplayers, does that count?
Bill: Kinda ye.
Bill: Still be cool to meet some cute photographer girl at a class like that tho.
Bill: Maybe I should see what county has for photography classes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): are there any 20-something girls in that class?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~are there any _girls_ in that class?~~
Bill: Fuck no.
Bill: 50+ year old kinda creepy dudes remember?
Bill: I wonder if the county college photography courses might be different though.
Bill: Not like it matters, I went to learn stuff which I did.
Bill: It’s like having friends/SOs into cosplay for you guys tho, people into what you are is cool.
