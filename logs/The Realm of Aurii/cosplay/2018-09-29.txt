Nokri (Marisa): *tape*
that's it that's what i'm missing for crossplay
that's the reason they sell it in every cosplay store and why i always see girls taping their faces. it's to make them look more masculine *that's the secret.*
it's too late for me to buy some for tomorrow ~~that's not horribly overpriced~~ but now i know for Ray i gotta get tape
Nokri (Marisa): *i have duct tape*
Nokri (Marisa): aaahhh i just sliced my neck. time to rest the cosplay.
Nokri (Marisa): found an old photoshoot that just consisted of me laying on the ground staring aimlessly up at the ceiling. bad photos but good times.
Elfriede (Tom): ðŸ˜±
Bill: > me: makes a story about the '60 people' who consistently read my story
> post gets close to 80 viewers
> *I guess I'm a liar*
Nokri (Marisa): such fame
Bill: ~~also that's not even an interesting post, why would 20 additional people view *that* over anything else?~~
Bill: wild.
Nokri (Marisa): the power of tilt worm is strong
Nokri (Marisa): pre-cosplay ironing is finished, time to throw everything in a bag so it can get wrinkled in transport again. also threw together a makeshift binder i'm gonna sew to myself at 7 in the morning. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜® be careful! Who are you cosplaying?
Nokri (Marisa): haine! i moved him up because i realized i have an expensive lecture to attend at school both days the girls festa is happening.

i could go the first day of the festa, but the lecture is at 2 and the event starts at 10. it takes about an hour to get to school from ikebukuro, and the changing room takes about an hour to go through, and then i'd have to change back into regular clothes so I would only be able to cosplay there for like an hour and a half to two hours before leaving which probably wouldn't be worth it.
Aldus (Jess): Oooo! Send pics! ~~Remember to drink water and try not run alot with your binder can attest that they hurt when they arnt good ones~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~lol, drink water~~
yeah i wish i had my actual binder. that was nice and comfortable. this one should be fine since it's just felt with elastic in the back. gonna be hot though with 5 layers of shirts.
Nokri (Marisa): it stinks because the lectures are all during cool events so i could either go to the game show or the girls festa, and i picked game show. how dare school.
Nokri (Marisa): i can still go walk around the festa
Nokri (Marisa): i had seven things on my legs (as in, pants/skirts/leggings) as remilia. the layer queen.
Aldus (Jess): Ommggg plz don't die
Nokri (Marisa): death in the name of crossdressing science
Nokri (Marisa): u know what i'm gonna be way too lazy and out of it to sew this in a timely manner so i'm gonna cut holes in the felt and just. tie the extra elastic around myself. yeah.
Nokri (Marisa): that's safe probably.
Nokri (Marisa): there we go it's basically a corset now
