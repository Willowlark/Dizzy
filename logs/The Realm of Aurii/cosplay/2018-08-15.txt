Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): This is the second time someone's said this Nani the heck
Aldus (Jess): maybe it is you <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Realistic artstyle, you're famous.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Touché
Bill: I see why they say it though, over like Meg or Gen. Congrats on being closest to canon.
Elfriede (Tom): It does a little tho
Elfriede (Tom): Idk if it's the expression or wjat
Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably the swol body :V
Elfriede (Tom): Too strongk
Aldus (Jess): ~~So humble~~
Bill: Wait, this ring light is bad, I can't get hits from Tom's fangirls looking for more photos.
Aldus (Jess): oo actually now that we have that i have idea too
Aldus (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  we could do poolside cosplay photos this weekend if you want too
Elfriede (Tom): Maybee
Elfriede (Tom): Not sure what cos tho
Aldus (Jess): anyone.  but in a swimsuit  YEA
Bill: ~~why did you need a ring light to do these things again~~
Aldus (Jess): cuz the lighting in our house is terrible
Elfriede (Tom): The best shots were near the window with a tiny tiny bit of soft lighting mixed with the ring light
Elfriede (Tom): But the background isn't as good
Elfriede (Tom): 
Elfriede (Tom): Observe
Elfriede (Tom): Lighting wise
Bill: flash light is harsh, yes. You can set up a backdrop.
Elfriede (Tom): But I'd turn the light up for next time
Bill: ~~or you have a photographer best friend with flash equipment and backdrops~~
Bill: I need to practice with the speed light and the studio lights Ron gave me.
Elfriede (Tom): WELL YEAH BUT ITS NOT CONVENTIENT FOR YOU TO COME OVER AFTER WORK
Elfriede (Tom): For you I mean
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: Asides from the fact I don't get back till like, 7, idc.
Aldus (Jess): It's nice to have the option to do things less formally that a photoshoot
Aldus (Jess): Then*
Bill: Eh, I like to fuck around with camera too, just never do. I digress. The *real* problem is probs Jess's reaction to having Unknown taking selfies in her house. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~If we look at your DMs is Tom just sending Unknown selfies to Jess all day from work~~
Bill: ~~irl Mystic Messenger~~
Aldus (Jess): Lmao plz
Aldus (Jess): Sometimes I get an idea for litterly I pic tho so I'm not gonna call you over for that lol
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): CCE line up confirmed <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Now I just need to think of how exactly I'm gonna go about A2, I lowkey don't wanna have to buy a new swimsuit and just use my black bikini
Afina (Georgia🍀): But then I'd forgo the tights and prob just do upper body android lines
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like in my make up test
Bill: A2, Bug/Pyrrha/Yona?
Afina (Georgia🍀): A2 Fri (I'll switch to a short wig for later hahahahahahah feels), Pyrrha Sat, Bug Sat nite, Yona Sun

Afina (Georgia🍀): Its lookin like it
Bill: ~~Hal's plans would be very good to know right now so~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think Hals aiming to do Saturday Sunday
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye for A2 I'll probably do the make up for the top half of this
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause I already need a red bikini top for Pyrrha and a red swimsuit for bug oops
Bill: Could do thigh highs to have an aspect of the leg coverings, same way Jess does.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH TRU
Aldus (Jess): ugh i have to order those
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'd had to buy new ones cause mine are cotton and I'd need a polyester
Elfriede (Tom): I gotta order swimmy Bois for ninea
Afina (Georgia🍀): _give nines floaties do it you coward_
Aldus (Jess): i need something thick enough not to tear in the water park
Bill: * wataaaa paaaaak
Afina (Georgia🍀): Did you use thigh highs last year jess?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Dats p smart
Aldus (Jess): yea i got them from amazon tho and i dont know whixh brand i ordered
Bill: (Amazon has an order history)
Aldus (Jess): it wasnt my current account tho i dont think
Aldus (Jess): CCE has MM meetups on friday and sunday wtffff
Aldus (Jess): oh nvm im dumd the friday one was last year WHOOPS
Aldus (Jess): this meetup only needs a yoosung 🤔
Aldus (Jess): time to bring back budget yoosung
Bill: *Hacking sounds*

Unknown: Yoosung ain't coming back
Aldus (Jess): but he likes yoosung! lolol
Aldus (Jess): oof im so tempted to just say ill do yoosung so i can be in da group
Aldus (Jess): pinky paradise is coming out with colored toric lenses  in 2 months 🙌
Aldus (Jess): there goess all my money
Afina (Georgia🍀): Toric is for astigmatism right?
Aldus (Jess): Ue
Aldus (Jess): Still not a TON of options but more than I had before
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEET
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ok for A2 I'm gonna do a bikini, thigh highs, and the upper body android lines
Aldus (Jess): Do et
Afina (Georgia🍀): For the big chunks on her arm I think ill thrown together some armbands from leftover black spandex
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll have the long wig most of the day and then later I'll just use my Weiss base for a short wig ~~and feels~~ ;3c
Bill: 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Elfriede (Tom): ;3c
Aldus (Jess): I gotta finish 2oobs
Bill: +2Butt
Aldus (Jess): It's getting an upgrade from last year 👌
Bill: ~~The butt?~~
Elfriede (Tom): Butt
**UPGRADE**
Aldus (Jess): Yeet
Aldus (Jess): Oof the MM group said they take dup's but I gave them the four I can cosplay and the said do either unknown or mc but I really wanna do v that do cuz it's his birthday 😬
Aldus (Jess): ~~plus my unknown looks no good compared to Tom's~~
Bill: Do V then?
Bill: They don’t control you.
Aldus (Jess): Obviously
Aldus (Jess): I'm  not saying that. I just probably shouldn't have given a list 😅
Bill: If you wanted to do V from the start, Ye.
Aldus (Jess): I only thought of it today but I got excited at the prospect of a group so I was like yea I can do all these and now I'm like opps
Bill: The. Say you’re doing V.
Aldus (Jess): <@351785752197201920>  would you wanna do unknown with me as v on Sunday at CCE?
Elfriede (Tom): Prob not
Bill: You’ll have your own group soon, once Erik picks a guy. Tom, Erik, You, then Georgia would fall for it, grab Justin...
Aldus (Jess): Mmkay
Aldus (Jess): Hmmm idk I'm kinda on the edge about it now. I might just make some lame excuse for why I can't go and duck out <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): ~~I'd do unknown but I look fat as him opps~~
Aldus (Jess): Aaannnd now I've stressed myself out
Aldus (Jess): Fuck
Bill: Tom is a bean pole, everyone looks fat next to him. You’re a great unknown or V or anything else, and you do what you want you crazy fangirl you.
Bill: You make a beautiful boy.
Aldus (Jess): My arms are too flabby for him. I wanna go and talk to fans but I feel like I'm being a nuisance by being picky with my costume when they really only want yoosung anyway?? I guess I could explain that I don't like the way I look as him but I don't wanna seem whiny either, ugh talking to new people is hard
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just be whoever and let your charm do the rest~
Bill: It is! RWBY is a special fandom that’s super welcoming. That said, if they’re allowing duplicates they have no right to complain. You tell them you want to do V because it’s his birthday  and if they have a problem with it, fuck em. Even easier way of knowing they aren’t worth knowing. Cosplay is for fun, I can understand doing a closed group for one of characters for the express purpose of a shoot BUT if they aren’t doing it for that purpose they should be happy to meet more fans.
Aldus (Jess): I mean they prob be fine with it I just feel silly
Aldus (Jess): And now I'm overthinking
Bill: You’re going to feel that way no matter what.
Bill: Just ignore it, knowing that for better or worse you tried to do something new and exciting.
Bill: Hell, if I didn’t go when Gen and Rob posted on Sunday of Zenkai to meetup and chat, I may not have had the confidence to accept Georgias invite to shoot. That 15 minutes (*cut short by the fucking homestucks rawr*) was the highlight of that con; because I risked it to make friends.
Aldus (Jess): Uguuu I'm so dumb I could have just said that from the beginning
Aldus (Jess): *shoots self*
Bill: You’re already a great V. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): I'll say sorry a million times and they'll forgive me just cuz it's in character
Aldus (Jess): Or I'll lie to get out of and not show up and that'll be in character too <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: There’s nothing to forgive tho.
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus (Jess): Biru can I borrow a camera if a cosplay V?
Aldus (Jess): At CCE?
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: 
Bill: They can fuck off about “allowing duplicates” it’s a casual meetup.
Aldus (Jess): Ok I'm being V
Aldus (Jess): Whoooo blue hair birthday boi
Aldus (Jess): The other girl doing v was like "yes plz do v wif me"
Bill: I saw. 😃
Aldus (Jess): Whoo!
Aldus (Jess): Now I gotta make a necklace
Aldus (Jess): I think they may be confused about the difference of a public and private shoot
Bill: You think?
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
