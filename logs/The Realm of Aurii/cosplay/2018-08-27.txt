Nokri (Marisa): mentioned in BNE but aliexpress is having a sale today (this week?)
it pains me that so many costumes can be bought for way cheaper than they can be made because i want to buy them all
Nokri (Marisa): violet evergarden is down to $50 hhhh
Nokri (Marisa): uwowo is a good name
Bill: Buying a Weiss cosplay?
Nokri (Marisa): no i just like the name
Nokri (Marisa): i finally bought haine so i'll have him by november. more people will recognize him at a japanese event than in the us
Nokri (Marisa): considering an inu x boku uniform since it's $13 and I can use the shirt for ray, but i'd get it shipped to the US because that's where my karuta wig is
Nokri (Marisa): it looks *really* meh though
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I got that swimsuit by the way!
Afina (Georgia🍀): The top is too small 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I'm gonna try to exchange it
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm hoping I can just exchange the top cause the bottoms fit PERF
Aldus (Jess): from target?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah from Amazon
Aldus (Jess): is this for pyrrha?
Bill: is that too small?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye I just needed the top so the bottoms are a bonus lol
Bill: I thought you were at work.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I am I forgot to share this last night lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): But yeah the underwire is like on da tit instead of under
Aldus (Jess): it looks good, hopefully you can exchange just he top
Bill: mm, does look cute.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah the bottoms are comfy and the high waist is apparently in
Afina (Georgia🍀): its just the darn top is too small
Afina (Georgia🍀): and its a LARGE
Afina (Georgia🍀): so im gonna get the XXL cause the L was very obviously VERY small
Bill: wooooow that's clickbait.
Elfriede (Tom): Right?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeaaaah
Bill: rich actually going back to compare, nicu.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think most would say pre war georgia lol
Bill: most people prefer your cosplay tho.
Bill: well, not prefer, but follow you for that.
Bill: Speaking of, if you liked that Mojojoj Weiss from last night, an outfit that’s white and soft would work for both Weiss and yourself.
Afina (Georgia🍀): reordered the swimsuit in XXL
Afina (Georgia🍀): its more important that the top fits more than the bottoms anyways
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i can prob sew the bottoms better than the tops
Afina (Georgia🍀): curse my weirdly proportioned body
Bill: No one is correctly proportioned.
Bill: ya'll gave meg the curse.
Eliran (Halim): may she RIP
