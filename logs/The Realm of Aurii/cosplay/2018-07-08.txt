Aldus (Jess): Oh he's a girl too?
Aldus (Jess): BRO like I don't think you work out, I do t think he sews and he's not a blonde girl
Bill: *only girls have aesthetics?*
Aldus (Jess): No silly
Aldus (Jess): Oh NVM I thought the button said girl on it too
Aldus (Jess): Still tho
Bill: Spoke to chatterbox, owner wasn't there but the manager there said people have done photos there before (a wedding apparently? I guess? nani the fuck?) so the owner should likely be okay with it. He or his daughter will be in tomorrow morning so I'll talk to them then about maybe shooting Sunday morning there. It will have to be morning too, gotta do it off business hours.  <@!245270932602486784>
Aldus (Jess): ~~can I come too~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): _he aint blonde tho_
Afina (Georgia🍀): YE JESS YOU FREE SUNDAY!
Afina (Georgia🍀): ?*
Aldus (Jess): I think so?
Aldus (Jess): I do t ahve fallout stuff tho, but maybe I could trow together something else time periody?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeee
Bill: Georgia has a dress that's old timer she showed me awhile back, could do pre and post war.
Aldus (Jess): I have a blue and white polkadots dot one that kinda vintage but I could probably order something else
Aldus (Jess): If I had more warning I would have liked to do a vault suit or other fallout outfit
Bill: 15th was going to be for glitter apocalypse, but we never got started on it so now we're filling the slot.
Bill: Especially given Georgia busy as fuck.
Aldus (Jess): Ah, I know you originally mentioned end of summer so
Bill: what, for Chatterbox?
Aldus (Jess): Yea or maybe that's just what I assumed
Bill: I'll ask when exactly they're closing up.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH JESS WAIT I have a black and red polka dot dress
Afina (Georgia🍀): We could do like a coordinated thing fo sho
Afina (Georgia🍀): I know we had suggested 50s Ladybug Bill but I'm totally cool just being 50s Georgia lol
Bill: I didn't think we were ever talking Bug.
Elfriede (Tom): yo thats like so soon
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh okay then good keep thinking that lol
Aldus (Jess): I thought you were doing vault suit
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bill pointed out that I could change and do both to optimize chatterbox time
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean, it's the same hair and make up
Aldus (Jess): Oh yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): So it's just a matter of swapping clothes in the bathroom
Afina (Georgia🍀): I can do both
Afina (Georgia🍀): You could prob borrow my suit too, if you wanna id be game to share
Aldus (Jess): that feels like cheating tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): We similar size ladies and it's breathable spandex anyways
Afina (Georgia🍀): Naaaah it's still dressing up to have fun so it's still cosplay
Afina (Georgia🍀): If you don't really like the idea of borrowing tho I gotcha, all good, it's not for everyone 👌
Aldus (Jess): Nah I mean I wanted to try making my own eventually I just didn't realize that there would be choot opportunity so soon
Bill: I can ask about late summer too.
Aldus (Jess): Up to you
Dave: 50's nier wit tom
Aldus (Jess): I don't know if I'd even have it done so I wouldn't want you switch it for that
Dave: Make him wear a fidora
Bill: Could still ride along for a pre war shoot.
Afina (Georgia🍀): [insert picture of small child saying why not both]
Afina (Georgia🍀): COULD GET CUTE ~~early~~ ANNIVERSARY PICS WITH TOM???
Afina (Georgia🍀): _share a milkshake like the 1950s_
Aldus (Jess): But then he'd need cloths too lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tuck shirt into pants, boom 1950:
Bill: Greaser style is easy, ya'll have leather jackets.
Aldus (Jess): And maybe suspenders
Bill: yup.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Depends if you want nerd tom or edgy tom
Aldus (Jess): Tru and if he even wants to do that
Aldus (Jess): We'd have to bring our own milkshakes since before opening
Bill: Yup.
Afina (Georgia🍀): BYOM
Afina (Georgia🍀): Bring Your Own Milkshakes
Bill: Your hair looks good for 50s too with the bleach blonde too. Georgia, you're going to do the fallout!Georgia wig right?
Aldus (Jess): I'd have to style it tho 😬
Afina (Georgia🍀): Uhhh good question
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'd love to get my own hair redone and try to use that but that looks unlikely
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk I sorta wanna try my own hair but I'm not sure I could do it 😐
Bill: I'd behind you on that one. It's an OC character, do whatever hairstyle your comfortable with.
Bill: But don't have time to hit the salon this week?
Bill: I have no idea what the light quality is there...
Dave: Just have to make a trip there, *for science*
Aldus (Jess): You'd have to go morning of unless you don't wash it
Bill: Which is not possible, timewise.
Aldus (Jess): Exactly
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh I mean I'd be gone thurs-fri, and working Saturday, and to do it by Wednesday would be too short notice
Bill: Well, you never know. Might be able to get an appointment.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Considering I've always scheduled like two weeks in advance? Doubtful. I should schedule so that I have my nice blonde back in time for my bday though
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also I threw it out on the RTX genderbend group about doing a private shoot of everyone, and I'm not sure anyone's gonna bite except Erik and maybe Meg
Afina (Georgia🍀): The cosplay climate is so different at RTX...
Bill: You'd be surprised what people can do if you ask. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: I mean, you knew that going in.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): People are less into private shoots there, it's so weird
Bill: industry con.
Bill: said it before, better off treating RTX as a vacation with Hal.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _damn industry con_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Its weird, but. I guess I get it
Afina (Georgia🍀): People pay for industry con, they wanna see the famous people, not hang with other fandom peeps
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: more time seems to be the thing for chatterbox, why don't I ask about late august? 19th?
Afina (Georgia🍀): All my August weekends are shot so if that's the case I would ask them garritys
Bill: In that case 15th is the primary.
Bill: ~~Good thing I didn't an attempt to do something for my birthday~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): RTX, North Carolina, Work, and the BNE shoot round off my August for Saturday's and Sunday's orz
Bill: mmmmhm.
Bill: should still see about that meteor shower tho... hmm.
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> so white balance is two sliders, cold to warm and green to purple tint. Do you know why that is?
Aldus (Jess): I won't be able to do anything on a weekday. And no
Bill: who said a weekday?
Bill: 15th is this coming weekend.
Aldus (Jess): Oh I thought you meant August
Bill: Nope.
Aldus (Jess): K
Bill: I'll see if he'd be open to a second time (if he's open to the first) in August too if you want.
Bill: But there's also the diner in ledgewood and your brother's farm for Fallout themed shoots.
Aldus (Jess): Nah it's fine don't worry about it if I can throw something together quick enough I'll come along, if not then you guys can just go
Bill: Coming anyway is helpful, if the lighting is bad may need assistants to make it work.
Aldus (Jess): Might be too early in the morning for me anyways,well see
