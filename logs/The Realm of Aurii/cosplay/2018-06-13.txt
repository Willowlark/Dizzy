Afina (Georgia🍀): what process should we suggest for nominating people to the BNE august shoot?
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause id love to invite kirsten, but only to the event not really the discord
Bill: It’s open to invites.
Bill: You’re running it.
Bill: Just go for it.
Bill: Definitely a good idea.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i have the power?_
Bill: You always did. So does everyone else. I told everyone this.
Afina (Georgia🍀): im still doing my research on PO boxes
Afina (Georgia🍀): theres one in wickatunk (which is like an old town that got absorbed into my town, marlboro) for 15 for 3 months
Afina (Georgia🍀): or i could get one by rutgers for 39 for 3 months
Afina (Georgia🍀): i like having it in highland park (by rutgers, but not in new brunswick itself) cause its VERY anonymous as to where i actually live
Afina (Georgia🍀): but still at college, so while i take summer classes, its close enough to visit
Afina (Georgia🍀): (though when summer classes end july 20th ill have to go out of my way to go there)
Afina (Georgia🍀): wickatunk is 9 mins from my house but idk im lowkey paranoid about people seeing that its in that town and deducing that i live in marlboro
Afina (Georgia🍀): am i being needlessly paranoid?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i suppose i could also go like three towns over to matawan or something
Bill: Either that or Rutgers. How often are you really going to visit the thing anyway.
Bill: ~~or don’t~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe once every two weeks or so
Afina (Georgia🍀): I MEAN i def wanna get one
Afina (Georgia🍀): at least to try out for 3 months
Bill: Well, to add to paranoia they’d know you go to Rutgers. You live there 9 months of the year.
Bill: But hell, don’t ask me. I don’t like it personally. I’m biased.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I _could_ get one by my work
Afina (Georgia🍀): which no one would know i work near there cause i dont mention work and dont intend to
Bill: That’s not a bad thought.
Nokri (Marisa): go for a really convoluted path. get a PO box in, like, north dakota but set up automatic forwarding to another PO box in Florida which will forward your mail to a PO box in New Jersey that you have to pick up
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeah by work would prob be the best for anonymity
Aldus (Jess): why am i looking at plans for lotor cosplays? someone tell me this is bad idea
Bill: it's terrible idea.
Aldus (Jess): is it? or are you just saying that
Bill: I dunno, do you want to go into a bathtub of purple dye to get your skin the right color?
Bill: Then go to work the next day still looking a tad off color?
Aldus (Jess): its only the face
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Dressed up as Drizzt then go to the Voltron shoot
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): YES
Aldus (Jess): hmmmm whos armor would be harder?
Aldus (Jess): drizzt i can prob take some creative liberty with
Aldus (Jess): as long as i have black body and green cape with fur trim
Aldus (Jess): wouldnt have to be AS dark for lotor though
Afina (Georgia🍀): Body paint isn't THAT bad
Aldus (Jess): i could reduce lotor down to a body suit if i wanted to go easy way out
Afina (Georgia🍀): How much skin he show
Aldus (Jess): just face
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh yeah that's not bad at all then
Aldus (Jess): yea its less than full raven would be
Aldus (Jess): ~~which i should probably do before anything else~~
Bill: If I use my new lens for portraits, it'd look like that.
Bill: (I didn't get it for that)
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOO BLURRED BACKROUND
Bill: *did you notice how her head is egg shaped?*
Dave: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Oh I thought that was just her head
Afina (Georgia🍀): me too lmao
Bill: ye, 500mm is too much, it compresses unnaturally.
