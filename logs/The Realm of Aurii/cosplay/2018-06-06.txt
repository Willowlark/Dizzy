Aldus (Jess): I didn't expect it to have to come in that much. But that's good cuz now I don't its not making me look bigger than I am

Bill: Story time for this Mist/Snow stuff, for anyone whose not caught up:
```
Pre Mist:
* Snow was invited to BNE (cosplay group Georgia, Hal, Marisa, Jess, Tom, and I are part of, RWBY cosplayers) by Erik before Katsu
* Our friend David from the con circuit messaged Hal that Snow was telling MorningMist Georgia was a bitchy person, stuff like that. Turned myself and others here off to Snow. Georgia sent a nice message to Mist and resolved any effects of the rumor mongering. 
* At Katsu, Snow used a wheelchair. The wheelchair (which was supposed to be a need) has never been seen since. This has been noticed and the theory is passed around that she had the wheelchair for sympathy.
* After Katsu Snow was a member of BNE, which was fairly quiet. Out of sight out of mind.
* At Zenkaikon last month Snow and Leanna got together officially, Leanna being another member of BNE. 
```
Bill: ``` Mist stuff:

* Morningmist had numerous accounts credits that were image after image saying "Morningmist is a bully". Dms were also sent to her from throwaway accounts. Mist received support from various people in the instagram world, and fans of hers reported the accounts attacking her. 

* Snow expressed during this that mist was actually a bully; Mist bullied her in the past. No details came out on what occurred between them, though I believe the phrase 'it takes two to tango' applies.

* Mist continued to get this accounts for awhile. 

* Snow received DMs from a friend (angryjigglypuff) of Mist's accusing her of being involved in the character attacks. The details of which are now on angryjigglypuff's instagram. Snow panicked to BNE, who supported Snow. 

* The DMs eventually reveal Snow was involved, but 'not the ringleader'. 

* Snow deleted all social media today asides from a tumblr with a suicide note. She left Leanna in the lurch, who called the police who confirmed Snow is fine. 

* Currently BNE supports Snow, believing Snow in that Mist is the real bully. 

* Various figures in the cosplay community (Mangaloo for one) support Mist, not directly against Snow but in that Mist is a good person. 
```
Bill: Mainly for Marisa, or anyone else who wants to enjoy the shit show. If I'm missing details let me know.
Bill: I personally think, based on what I know of the two, they're both problems. Mist strikes me as manipulative and/or catty, Snow bitchy and a drama whore. I've never met Mist, and I avoid Snow when I can, but I trust my gut.
Bill: or just really want none of this shit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): David likes Mist so thats always a plus
Bill: I'm a salt machine and more bitter than would have thought, but drama is beyond me.
Bill: That's true.
Dave: the drama
