Aldus (Jess): Well fuck
Bill: you don't cosplay any of them.
Aldus (Jess): I know 😭 but but but
Bill: just admire.
Aldus (Jess): "hi I just wanna come to your meet up and talk about mm ok?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): I literally wanna punt some of these nerds
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like _take a fucking shower_
Afina (Georgia🍀): We got out of the RWBY panel and my patience was getting THIN
Afina (Georgia🍀): I've never been happier to escape to a Starbucks
Afina (Georgia🍀): UGH A CHILL PICKLE FOUND ME
Bill: Please survive. If weebs need to be cut so be it.
Aldus (Jess): OH NO
Aldus (Jess): In Starbucks?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah after the panel
Afina (Georgia🍀): These damn fanboys
Aldus (Jess): How awkward on a scale of 1-10?
Afina (Georgia🍀): 100
Afina (Georgia🍀): They get all tongue tied and nervous but simultaneously also seem to assume we're friends cause they follow my content
Afina (Georgia🍀): It makes me wanna pull my hair out
Afina (Georgia🍀): A LOT of people here are just really awkward
Afina (Georgia🍀): And that's fine but it feels like I'm hand holding people through a lot of conversations
Aldus (Jess): Yeaaaaaa I'd imagine
Afina (Georgia🍀): And people are like "plz hang out with me" and it's omg duck off
Aldus (Jess): Ughhh really? 😮
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH
Aldus (Jess): Like nah fam I'm here to have a gud time
Afina (Georgia🍀): and there's people I actually wanna say hi to? Like I met Sam, Megs ex boyf, and he's really cool
Aldus (Jess): Oh yea of course!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Here also gives me highkey clingy vibes tho (not towards friends but like as a person) but he's really chill to talk to
Afina (Georgia🍀): And he hates ethan too
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I saw spencer, mad props armory, and he was cool but I was dashing to the RWBY panel
Aldus (Jess): Whooo!
Afina (Georgia🍀): I hung out with a couple "RWBY cosplay famous" people? That was cool
Bill: You mean normal people.
Bill: Wow.
Bill: The famous are the normal people.
Bill: Industry con is full of cringe~
