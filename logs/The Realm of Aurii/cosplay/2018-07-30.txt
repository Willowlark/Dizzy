Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I remade one thigh piece and hoo boy does it look better
Afina (Georgia🍀): I have yet to paint it but from the test fit it's goin good so far
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I glued Velcro in to make a makeshift kinda garter too so I'm just gonna run around the house now to see if it falls
Bill: Huh. Wonder if anyone every tried using actual garters for armor like that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think that's what Meg says she does
Afina (Georgia🍀): But she also has to yank them up repeatedly throughout the day
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I did a combo of makeshift garters and also Velcro that attaches to my sock
Afina (Georgia🍀): And the socks sewn to my tights so the socks can't fall meaning the thighs can't fall
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's very intricate I must say lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): Update, I walked around with one old thigh piece on, and one new one. The old one fell down to my ankles in like 5 minutes and the new one hasn't really budged <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): NICU
Bill: So like, Velcro strong garters.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Technically the Velcro is at the front of the thigh piece and the garter is IN it on top
Elfriede (Tom): oo neet idea
Elfriede (Tom): did it fall?
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
