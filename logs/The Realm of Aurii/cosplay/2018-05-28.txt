Nokri (Marisa): Super strong fashion tape and or glue might work for boots if you don’t have socks
Or elastic around the top
I like to stuff foam inside my boot covers to keep them stiff but it depends on how tall they are before it just looks clunky

Afina (Georgia🍀): ye he already has plans he said at CPAC
Afina (Georgia🍀): its so annoying that anext doesnt release its schedule tho like plz
Nokri (Marisa): yeah they usually release it after they get everything back from the printers but like
why can't you release it at the same time you send it off to get printed
Bill: Next is run poorly, but that’s not news.
Nokri (Marisa): truuuuuu
but most anime cons don't release their schedule until the week before or the week of
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yee, i get the finalization thing, big organizations dont usually run these (cept like anime nyc) butt
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: makes it hard to plan if you actually wanna do events
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: AND shoots
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: cant really complain too much tho cuz i get it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i just ordered my yona wig but it says itll get here in time for anext

Bill: play the game first.
Nokri (Marisa): there's a type of paint now i hear that you can use to paint on gloves so they're compatible with smart phones

Nokri (Marisa): I used a paint for my nowi gloves that worked pretty decently but I can’t find it on amazon anymore <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus (Jess): Pretty sure all Nier characters have gloves
Nokri (Marisa): You could say nierly all of them wear gloves
Bill: that was bad.
Bill: true, but bad.
Bill: That cosplayer did a great job on the plate lines on her skin.
Bill: Makeup is a little creepy though.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: They DO all wear gloves
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Another day, another useless reaction
Bill: Why is everything from Zenkai so fincky and bad.
Bill: It’s supposed to be getting easier with time, not harder.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍:

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Finally finished the damn base of the head
Afina (Georgia🍀): _no tom you can't make progress cause then I have to as well_
