Elfriede (Tom): Question <@301927856240459777> theoretically of someone were to bring a bow to a con and wear it around thier body, how would you get away with that?
Elfriede (Tom): Cuz it's technically a weapon with moving parts right?
Elfriede (Tom): Unless maybe you replace the string withregular string but you'll still be stopped most likely hmmmmmm
Nokri (Marisa): yee, depends on the con. whatcha thinking?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Some cons say you can't have a bow with a string on it
Afina (Georgia🍀): At all period
Nokri (Marisa): usually the rule is the bow either can't be strung, or can't be strung with any tension (so it can have a string but it's gotta be super limp)
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I figured as much 😭
Elfriede (Tom): It would just be so inconvenient to have to carry it
Elfriede (Tom): Guess you could back mount it but I was thinking of the classic string around the torso thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): I can't believe tom wants to cosplay Yona
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): You might be able to do that? Depends on the con tho
Nokri (Marisa): zenkaikon allows stringed bows as long as the tension is lax, and katsucon you can get away with it as long as it can't actually shoot anything
Elfriede (Tom): I'll have to read into specifics of cons I suppose
Elfriede (Tom): Or at least make the string removable in case I get yelled at
Elfriede (Tom): Me and Jess we're tossing around ideas for Ashitaka ,but I feel like you need the bow
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooo. ~~you also need the horse antelope thing~~
Elfriede (Tom): GASP
Elfriede (Tom): And the demon ✋
Elfriede (Tom): And the San <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): i has a san cosplay but jess would be a better san i can be a forest spirit bobble head
Elfriede (Tom): I love the forest spirits <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): Nevermind scrap everything we're all gonna do forest spirits
Elfriede (Tom): And stare and plants rattling our heads
