Aldus (Jess): ok keep ma job
Aldus (Jess): and wear wigs in my undies
Afina (Georgia🍀): True but also she got so much money she went to another whole con states away so

Bill: It's a lot of money for an 'amatuer' patreon, ye.
Bill: Wonder if they're a couple, otherwise they probably split the income.
Aldus (Jess): he makes props or?
Aldus (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  join patreon when?
Bill: Prop maker, from the looks of it.
Aldus (Jess): we could make lewd otp pics together
Bill: Yo, accentkisses feed looks terrible though. I dunno if all the photos are heavily filtered, but they look terrible.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Tbh lewds are what really sells no matter the quality from what I've seen
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Bill: ~~whoops I respect women~~
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Especially if you offer like lewd snap or skypes
Bill: *more like care about photo quality 😅 *
Bill: And looking at the comments, it's because she's just trying to get people to hit up patreon.
Bill: I am unimpressed.
Bill: ~~tbh she isn't even cute~~
Aldus (Jess): omg i get creeped out on my regular account i couldn't imagine sending snaps and skypes
Bill: me either. Cause who actually uses skype, it's 2018.
Aldus (Jess): ok yea thats not the problem lmao
Aldus (Jess): ~~i rarely send lewd to my own husband~~ i couldn't image sending them to random dudes
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): I feel ya with that
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): I don't have enough confidence for it either lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like patreon would feel like selling out for me
Afina (Georgia🍀): And would kinda be the point where cosplay isn't just a fun hobby anymore
Bill: Don't turn your hobby into a job, yeah.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _frustrating as fuck tho like damn I could be out here makin 2K just rolling around in my underwear_
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Hahahaha
Bill: you aren't going to be broke forever~
Bill: I know that'a s foreign concept, but I thought the same thing a year ago.
Bill: ~~also if you do a lewd patreon just for the money, isn't that effectively prostitution in a way?~~
Aldus (Jess): i may not be broke but i could still be making 2K extra a month
Aldus (Jess): LOL as if
Aldus (Jess): maybe like $500
Aldus (Jess): nah prob like 20 cents and an old eraser
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao those are two different things

Aldus (Jess): pros·ti·tute
ˈprästəˌt(y)o͞ot/Submit
noun
1.

Aldus (Jess): guess it depends on your definition of sexual activity but id say no
