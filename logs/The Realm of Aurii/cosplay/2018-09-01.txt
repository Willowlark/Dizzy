Nokri (Marisa): someone on reddit is asking about cosplay photoshoots in tokyo
they think the cost of using a cosplay studio includes costume rental and a photographer
oh you sweet summer child
Nokri (Marisa): in other news though studio crown now offers that for tourists. interesting. they used to host the international cosplay meetups so they probably got the idea from that. but that studio is suuuuuuuper tiny.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Whoooa that's cool
Nokri (Marisa): yee but they're really wringing tourists for everything they've got. $90 for 1 polaroid and 1 digital image in costume and wig, from a 5-10 minute photoshoot. or $150 for 6 pictures and makeup done by *real cosplayers*.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~it's like katsucon pricing eyy~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I should work on Yona but I made the mistake of playing the Nier soundtrack while sewing so now I wanna play Nier 😭😭😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): Procrastination here I come
Nokri (Marisa): ***NO. YONA NEEDS YOU.***
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yona needs me.......................... later
Nokri (Marisa): wwyd
what would yona do
Afina (Georgia🍀): Play Nier probably 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): *no* she would go kill a bear or something
Afina (Georgia🍀): You can kill a bear or something in Nier
Afina (Georgia🍀): Kinda
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's a boar is that close enough
Afina (Georgia🍀): They're both furry and start with B
Bill: ~~its just a bathrobe~~
Nokri (Marisa): bona
Nokri (Marisa): biru you take that back it is elegant and refined
Afina (Georgia🍀): I cut out the pieces for Yonas bathrobe does that count
Afina (Georgia🍀): _im so unmotivated_
Nokri (Marisa): u gotta
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like cosplay is just not being felt right now
Afina (Georgia🍀): I don't even wanna work on Lux or nothin
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I was mad hype about that chestplate
Nokri (Marisa): do 
it
for
her
Bill: Rippoeroni. Poor Hak.
Nokri (Marisa): i found some footage from a yona meetup the other day will that inspire you
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~more like do it for Hak cause that's one nice piece of mans~~
Nokri (Marisa): maybe if you listen to the newest drama CD you'll feel inspired. it's good stuff.
Nokri (Marisa): discord with the 8mb file limit. uguu.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): wow. that is the saddest video i've ever seen. 1080p reduced to this mess. don't bother looking.
Nokri (Marisa): if anyone ever asks how i edit my photos i'll just send them this and let my naturally muscley biceps intimidate them into silence
Nokri (Marisa): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Dawwww
Afina (Georgia🍀): This girl is so cute
Afina (Georgia🍀): She looks pretty young
Elfriede (Tom): Wow Marisa howed you get so strong 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): flintstones vitamins
Nokri (Marisa): is that girl allowed to be on instagram

Nokri (Marisa): her guards
Dave: #1 wiserice fan
Nokri (Marisa): did................................... did this person read anything i wrote............
Nokri (Marisa): i hope that's a typo
Aldus (Jess): Wow
Aldus (Jess): It's like litterly the first thing you said
Elfriede (Tom): Oof
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I got this app that Lily recommended for Instagram analytics
Afina (Georgia🍀): _look who is my most active fan_
Bill: Paladin Waluigi likes soul Cal.
Elfriede (Tom): ohh shiiiiiiitt
Nokri (Marisa): see see! this is a perfect example of the issues in costume contests at big cons
Nokri (Marisa): you have stuff like this in the novice division. notice this is *second place for novice* category.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): second place craftsman division?
Nokri (Marisa): yes there's some serious skill involve and that todoroki costume is probably super impressive because craftsmen are intense but there's a huge imbalance
Nokri (Marisa): more pics of each:
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Yea that's a huge imbalance
Nokri (Marisa): novice is overly competitive and saturated with people while craftsman category is usually the same people, competing until they're offered a spot as a judge.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm gathering items i'll need to make stuff for katsu now so it'll all be ready when i'm back in the states
I think I know why this person bought clip-on earrings <:lenny:395307171539189760> ❤
Afina (Georgia🍀): I was gonna spirit gum mine
Afina (Georgia🍀): oooo which  means I need to order spirit gum
Afina (Georgia🍀): Unless those have prime shipping 👀
Nokri (Marisa): that's what i did for mine! go to Spirit Halloween store after halloween they sell it by the huge jug for dirt cheap
yeah those have prime shipping :3c
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077TNPZMT/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A29XXIZFENJQ9I&psc=1
Nokri (Marisa): i'm getting these for katarina because dangly rocks are harder to glue to your face
Afina (Georgia🍀): Thank
Afina (Georgia🍀): MAWISA do you not have pierced ears too?
Nokri (Marisa): no :0
Nokri (Marisa): AM I NOT ALONE
Nokri (Marisa): the orchestral version of the grill song from spongebob is playing in my head this is a joyeous occasion
Afina (Georgia🍀): People always think I have pierced ears but I just never got them
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I don't care enough about earrings to get them now
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~except for cosplay~~
Nokri (Marisa): the things we do for cosplay
my sister has pierced ears which is odd because she's the most tomboyish person ever and as far as I know has never ever worn earrings. even during her first wedding, no earrings. my mother took her to get them pierced when she was really little so i wonder why I don't have them
Nokri (Marisa): maybe it's the jewish thing? mother is really strange about certain stuff.
Afina (Georgia🍀): None of my sibling have pierced ears 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): clip-ons are really popular in japan, my friend said ear piercing is rare here
Bill: You don't do jewelry at all right Georgia?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I don't
Afina (Georgia🍀): I don't like it lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk why I just never found appeal in it
Nokri (Marisa): me too
this is getting scarily close to clone territory
Nokri (Marisa): jess do you wear jewelry
Bill: Huh. I tried to imagine you with jewelry, it doesn't click. Which is odd, considering I like jewelry. (if you can't tell from my ring, watch, necklace...)
Nokri (Marisa): do u need me to photoshop jewelry on anyone, o swag king?
Aldus (Jess): Yea I wear jewelry I always wear my wedding and engagement ring obviously but I also wear necklaces, earings, rings, anklets etc depending on the occasion. Like I don't wear anything besides my ring on the daily but I like to wear jewelry when I like of it
Nokri (Marisa): my preferred jewelry would be something silver and covered in spikes that I can tie to the end of my hair and whip around like a wrecking ball :3c
i usually keep a ring in the bottom of my bag somewhere but it's a self defense ring, one of those ones that look like a cat but that you can use to mess people up.
Nokri (Marisa): omg that's right married people have jewelry
Aldus (Jess): Yea, before we got married I wore a promise ring since 2011 so I'm used to it
Nokri (Marisa): jess the ring expert
Nokri (Marisa): that's such a long time. your ring-wearing habit could attend elementary school.
Aldus (Jess): Lols yea we've had rings for 7 years 😬
Nokri (Marisa): 7~~07~~
Aldus (Jess): I wear a to ring sometimes too but I know that's kinda weird
Nokri (Marisa): you could kick people with that
Bill: Lol. I've had a class ring since 2010. I've got you beat. 😂
Nokri (Marisa): biru has a senpai ring
Nokri (Marisa): doujinshi about tom and jess's rings and biru's ring at a school
Aldus (Jess): It's not a competition tho
Bill: Nah.
Nokri (Marisa): are u sure
Bill: It's just amazing how long I've been wearing a class ring.
Bill: ~~throwback to the campaign idea I had involving class rings and super powers~~
Aldus (Jess): My class ring doesn't fit anymore
Bill: But yeah, especially since class rings aren’t popular.
Aldus (Jess): It was sized pre weight loss so it just falls off
Bill: High school right?
Nokri (Marisa): i don't know anyone at my school who got a ring
Aldus (Jess): Yea
Bill: I don’t know anyone who got a rowan one.
Bill: Jostens (the company that did tech’s rings) will resize it for free if you send it to them.
Bill: They’re a really good company.
Nokri (Marisa): i wish they had decent video of that guy who juggled knives. i want to see that again.
Bill: I got mine modified to read Student council president rather than just student council.
Aldus (Jess): Yea I know
Bill: Just too much effort? 😄
Aldus (Jess): I just don't really care to wear it
Aldus (Jess): I can fit it on my right pointer if I really wanna wear it
Afina (Georgia🍀): A marriage ring is like a SUPER promise ring
Bill: Yee, most people stop high school rings.
Bill: This has motivated to make my first Facebook post in like, a year.
Nokri (Marisa): oh my god i was looking at the old male beauty pageant videos again and you can hear BoJo cracking up so loudly. we must've been near the camera i'm so embarassed.
Aldus (Jess): Lmao
Nokri (Marisa): some of these guys work for politicians in DC now
I wonder if those politicians know this video exists <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus (Jess): I was trying to creep but I have like no service
Bill: She has boyfriend.
Aldus (Jess): Awww

Bill: They've been dating 4 years. Unless Eriks been holding a torch for a long time, might not be crush girl.
Elfriede (Tom): OO BUT IS PROB HER
Elfriede (Tom): Could be
Afina (Georgia🍀): Something something Sakura frustration something
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just wish she would talk to me about more than just cosplay oof
Bill: What now.
Afina (Georgia🍀): She was all "let's do a RWBY group" and then wants everyone to plan around HER schedule
Afina (Georgia🍀): So she messaged me like "are you not doing RWBY with us Sunday? Cause otherwise we need to find a replacement"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And internally im like Uhhh YEAH I said I'm not going Sunday do you think I'd just work things out for you????
