Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/gallery/2018/06/24/grey-weiss.html Grey, fucking Towers.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEEEET
Nokri (Marisa): “Grey” homestuck???
“Towers” oh
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Since Marisa isn't in that one <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Why not actually? Cuz not caught up on rwby?
Afina (Georgia🍀): marisa why do you hide from rwby
Nokri (Marisa): Wot
Wot I miss
Nokri (Marisa): Is that the hidden aurii chat for the Cool Kids
Bill: We started it to post RWBY spoilers.
Bill: Been dead mostly.
Nokri (Marisa): I’m caught up on rwby
Nokri (Marisa): Invite me I can meme it up <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): If Georgia yeets strong enough I will be transported across space and time
Bill: I’ll add you in the morning then.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill begin collecting my yeet energy then
Nokri (Marisa): Biru needs time to erase the lewd and cleanse the chat
Bill: 😏
Bill: ~~oops~~ Well there is that Pyrrha Daki....
Nokri (Marisa): There it is. Georgia’s next cosplay. 
Rip arm holes and a head hole in the daki
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): These are all apparently RWBYs from New Jersey
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I only vaguely know the Yang
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~how does someone escape my mad networking skills~~
Nokri (Marisa): capture them immediately
Nokri (Marisa): o i've seen the weiss before, she cosplays watamote and was in that big sailor waitress group
Nokri (Marisa): the others must be assimilated
Afina (Georgia🍀): So, to minimize my chance of death at RTX, I'm gonna swap out jeans for jean shorts at RTX
Afina (Georgia🍀): so I ordered some orange socks to match Jaune's orange arm guard things
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): These are some bright as orange socks
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I'm wondering if it's just a too overwhelming orange, or if the idea of the socks is just stupid to begin with
Aldus (Jess): yea thats a good idea
Aldus (Jess): na i like the socks
Aldus (Jess): the match his arm bandies? liek same chade?
Afina (Georgia🍀): They're like pretty close to his canon orange arm guards ~~I just don't wanna be a living traffic cone if they look ugly~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee they match
Aldus (Jess): na it good
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): They're a little brighter
Afina (Georgia🍀): But also I'm doing a genderbend so I have a flexible range
Aldus (Jess): NA YOU GOOD
Afina (Georgia🍀): THANK JESS
Bill: Nah, that’s awesome.
Bill: Do it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeee it'd keep me cooler AND it separates my fem jaune design from reg jaune
Bill: Ye, there's a lot of value in making it your own design. Jaune is pretty basic, so spicing it up makes it yours. Plus, adds a bit of femininity to really nail the genderbend feel.
Bill: I didn't hit send before whoops
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah and it's stil "jaune"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Its not out of character for jaune to have knee highs
Bill: Yup. Gotta take a couple liberties, especially with Jaune.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeee
Bill: his outfit is so gender neutral you need to mix it up a bit to get the real genderbend feel.
Bill: Jake is preaching again and I’m like “don’t do something stupid”.
Aldus (Jess): Oh so
Aldus (Jess): Ethan and Casey went to six flags and a ride they we're on broke down for 7 hours 😱
Eliran (Halim): HA
Eliran (Halim): That sucks
Aldus (Jess): ~~i saw that~~
Eliran (Halim): Lol
Eliran (Halim): I initially felt that way
Eliran (Halim): But then I remembered casey and some rando were there too and had to suffer
Aldus (Jess): Yeeee
Bill: That was Casey’s brother I believe.
Bill: In Casey’s story.
Bill: ~~I knew I saw a Ha~~
Eliran (Halim): ah that'd make sense
Bill: ~~it’s what I was going to say too tho~~
