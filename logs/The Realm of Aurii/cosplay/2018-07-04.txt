Nokri (Marisa): My box of cosplay just arrived but it’s 9am I am too tired for cosplay now
Nokri (Marisa): I’m too awake to sleep but too tired to do anything else this is awful
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmmmmmmm
Afina (Georgia🍀): New goals
Bill: Swim suit first ay.
Elfriede (Tom): Mmmmmm nicuuu
Aldus (Jess): Is that a bodysuit that's been painted
Nokri (Marisa): Looks like they did the homestuck arm sock thing but put gloves over it
Nokri (Marisa): costumes have been tried on (except for alibaba because i don't want to unravel the giant midriff piece now and i'm still not sure if i want to cosplay him or stick with morg and give the costume to a third person for our cosplay group)

maki is really comfortable and there's a really nifty bit of fabric that hides the buttons on the front i'm gonna learn to sew and steal for future costumes. i'm probably gonna do a maki day at a future con where i just cosplay different versions of her all day.

i still don't understand how sizing works because miku's small skirt and mephisto's large pants both fit the same (wearable but tight). i need to find out what they did to mephisto's collar to make it stick up like it does because it's awesome and no amount of pelon and stiffening spray achieved that effect with nowi's collar. 

sheryl and remilia's zippers are a little finicky but they can be replaced if it becomes a big problem. i was only stuck in remilia for like 10 minutes so it's probably fine.
Nokri (Marisa): mephisto's parts will also provide a nice base for Ray. it'll be a lot easier to make a pattern for all the under-tux pieces.
Elfriede (Tom): OHHHHHH  yooo that's nice
Elfriede (Tom): I need this site in america
Elfriede (Tom): Oof
Nokri (Marisa): i just heard a notification blip come from this site. but no notifications. spooky.
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH they need this site in the US.
it'd be also cool if there was a cosplay-specific dry cleaners.
Nokri (Marisa): they have so many costumes that i spent like $200 making and they're selling them for $10-20
i'm like <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): SO JELLLLY
Elfriede (Tom): I'd spend all the muney
Aldus (Jess): Yea I'd spend mad cash 💰except not really apparently
Nokri (Marisa): i'm curious how they price stuff because some things are like, $2
and other things are $90 like this
http://www.mitubado.com/56_130494.html
Nokri (Marisa): they have some love live outfits for $20 that i know you can buy new for $15 on aliexpress so their pricing is a mystery
Aldus (Jess): Loooolll that's should not be $90
Nokri (Marisa): next zeld shoot we gonna lick some rocks

> By 4,other guy is therefore not friends (Facebook at least) with Rebecca 
> by 5, Guy is not Rebecca’s rumored crush
> Other guy must then be friend of Erik or Heather
> Erik x Rebecca can fly.
Bill: > bonus round, Rebecca is cosplaying Erik’s darling partner.

Elfriede (Tom): pvffft a leo thing
Bill: Don’t shoot the messenger.
Bill: Y’all know I’m a a sucker for personality theory.
Aldus (Jess): ~~you can't just blame stuff in your sign~~

Afina (Georgia🍀): the leo zodiac requires at least (1) JNPR shoot a month to function
Afina (Georgia🍀): dont blame me, blame the stars
Elfriede (Tom): 🙏
Bill: You right, guess it just is the way it is.
Afina (Georgia🍀): tom what foam were you using? tnt cosplay, any particular type?
Elfriede (Tom): tnt eva foam, nothing in paricular
Elfriede (Tom): its just nice clean foam
Elfriede (Tom): not that badly priced either, just need to wait the week an a half shipping time
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye i took a look, i think its cheaper per square inch than the eva foam i used to order
Afina (Georgia🍀): not sure tho
Elfriede (Tom): ooo maybe!
its (mainly) what the poppy hammer is made out of too, since dave ordered it first
Elfriede (Tom): YO THEY HAVE EVA DOWELS
Elfriede (Tom): Shit i wish i saw that before thats dope
Elfriede (Tom): i only bought the 38
Elfriede (Tom): now the 50 but i've heard that high density is super nice
Elfriede (Tom): i just ordered 1 of every size too, just to have it
Elfriede (Tom): ALOT of weapon making videos from pros seem to use high density, but 38 is just a bit softer, depends what you are making i suppose
Elfriede (Tom): guns is prob good to use high density or things with small parts
