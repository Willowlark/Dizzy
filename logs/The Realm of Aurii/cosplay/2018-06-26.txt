Bill: Tom and Jess do need a couple name, if only for cosplay.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: i thought it was "Actually Married"
Bill: Need a catchier one?
Bill: like something smooth enough you could Hashtag it.
Nokri (Marisa) 🤹♀: Wasn’t it Canon
Bill: Not obvious enough it's about them.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I guess that's kinda funny that their ship name is actually married
Afina (Georgia🍀): Whoozikun is pretty cool
Afina (Georgia🍀): Though I'm a big fan of smashing names together so I may be biased
Bill: neeeeever would have guessed.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHOOZIKUN SOUNDS AWESOME THO lets be real
Bill: It's like one too many syllables but yes.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: tomica
Afina (Georgia🍀): Three syllables isn't a loooot
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ooooo that sounds like a precious metal
Aldus (Jess) ♊: it is most precious
Bill: Or Tom as girl.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: RIP
Afina (Georgia🍀): Update, I was thinking of Formica and that's a type of granite
Bill: like, Angelica, Tomica.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: formica's actually a brand of laminate which is plastic, white granite is stone
Aldus (Jess) ♊: both are used for countertop tho
Bill: kamistry posted basically his dick again!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Damn
Bill: See image in NSFW.
Bill: All things that breath must appreciate his abs.
Afina (Georgia🍀): You met him when he was cosplaying 9s???

Bill: Last CCE.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I don't imagine 9s as shredded
Aldus (Jess) ♊: yeee nah hed make a better eve

Afina (Georgia🍀): I'd take them abs tho
Aldus (Jess) ♊: 🌶

Aldus (Jess) ♊: OH so my friend is taking me to her gym tomorrow and if I like it I might get a membership too so we can go together regulatory
Bill: Nora gains.
Afina (Georgia🍀): DO IT BILL
Bill: what?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I CAN GO WITHOUT BEING A POSER NOW
Bill: Oh, the *Nier shoot*, okay, I thought you meant the gym.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YE Nier
Bill: ~~If you do A2 you're still a poser until you find her in game~~
Bill: oh wait, did you enjoy the sand surfing?
Afina (Georgia🍀): How far in is she
Afina (Georgia🍀): I DID
Aldus (Jess) ♊: ~~ye i think she just glazed over the gym part~~
Bill: Cause I will never get over that being a fantastic game mechanic, *despite the fact 2B is doing that in heels*.
Afina (Georgia🍀): O no I support the gym too
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just saw Nier and I was like OWO
Bill: Which friend tho Jess, don't Gabi and Jenn live a distance away?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'd be more hype for gym if Jess was my buddy 😏😏😏😏
Bill: you work out more than the rest of us so...
Aldus (Jess) ♊: its Gabby, she lives kinda far but she crosses past rockaway on the way to and from work in morristown
Bill: yeee, okay. Makes sense.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: I work out 3 times a week
Aldus (Jess) ♊: just at home so its not that good of a workout
Aldus (Jess) ♊: with a partner/at a gym id workout more often and more intensly
Aldus (Jess) ♊: ~~georgia come be my gym buddy~~
Bill: *Nora* intensely?
Aldus (Jess) ♊: nora can bench like 8 times her weight bor
Aldus (Jess) ♊: so no
Bill: Did you mean to say: "Goals?"
Aldus (Jess) ♊: no lmao

Bill: heh.
Bill: Jess goes up behind some norm lifting.
Bill: Watches him do two reps.

Aldus (Jess) ♊: lmao you severely overestimate us
Bill: ~~do you really think I expect a photoshoot in a gym to happen?~~
Bill: or a video, as this may be.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: idk man you get some wild ideas
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~yes?~~
Bill: We'd need a gym. Those have normies.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or a home gymmm
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hotel gyms too
Bill: Jess can't yell at a random people to exercise harder in an empty gym.
Aldus (Jess) ♊: thats what dave is for
Bill: Dave is *every* extra?
Aldus (Jess) ♊: 🤔
Aldus (Jess) ♊: we can recruit a few more
Bill: look at all of that... Ren.
Bill: hotel gyms would lack weight equipment.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nooo
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao wtfff
Aldus (Jess) ♊: https://www.kalahariresorts.com/pennsylvania/things-to-do/pamper-yourself/fitness-and-training/
Aldus (Jess) ♊: kalahari has weights
Bill: okay, Kalahari is different ye.
Bill: I was thinking normal hotel.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Kirsten asked me if she can invite other friends to the BNE event
Afina (Georgia🍀): I said if she needs a +1 just let me know and I'll "okay" it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Anyone else I said for her to send me their names and I'll see what BNE says
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's a conservative answer just in case
Bill: Yeah, though I hate to feel like Sarah.
Bill: But Snow shot that in the foot.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The difference is that BNE is a hangout first
Bill: Though, the event isn’t BNE. BNE can be conservative, the event doesn’t really need to be.
Bill: Unless someone tries to invite Mist/Jake.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean just to be safe I figured she just send me the names first
Afina (Georgia🍀): There's people we would probably just prefer not to see possibly
Afina (Georgia🍀): For the same reason we took away invite privileges to the discord
Bill: We just don’t need accidental drama. That’s more an issue with the server tho.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): She was just asking about it cause she wanted to invite Zach? I think his name was
Afina (Georgia🍀): Male ladybug
Bill: Zach was it.
