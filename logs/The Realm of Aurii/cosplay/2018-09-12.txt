Nokri (Marisa): I have to get to my computer for cosplay talks
What‚Äôs y‚Äôall‚Äôs next con?
Aldus (Jess): uhhh animenyc for like a day, then katsu
Aldus (Jess): ~~technically ray, saeran and mc could be used for formal aswell but i think mawisa has plans for that already~~
Nokri (Marisa): ooo anime nyc is a thing again???
Nokri (Marisa): ye i was considering ray for formal but i might do katarina for that
Nokri (Marisa): oh wow i didn't know anime nyc came back. bout time
Aldus (Jess): yea the had it last year too
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooo is that what the voltron is for? owo
Nokri (Marisa): wait nvm i'm on the nycc page oops
Aldus (Jess): nahhh thats like a far off plan cuz friends wanna do a group
Aldus (Jess): but they only go to like 2 cons a year
Nokri (Marisa): animefest is still a thing? but i guess that's what anime nyc replaced? because animefest merged with nycc and it looks like now you can buy separate tickets that just get you into anime-ish stuff at nycc, like voltron and rwby. that's weird.
Aldus (Jess): üòÆ weird
Aldus (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  do you have black dress pants?
Elfriede (Tom): Just the adam ones
Aldus (Jess): are they blakc? or patterned?
Aldus (Jess): i cant remember
Elfriede (Tom): Black
Elfriede (Tom): Or gray
Elfriede (Tom): Hmm
Elfriede (Tom): I think black
Aldus (Jess): i think they are v. dark grey
Aldus (Jess): ~~you need a suit jacket anyway~~
~~we wouldn't have to buy another wig this way~~
Nokri (Marisa): i could bring Jaehee but because it's a super simple costume i'd do her for a little on thursday ~~multiple thursday costumes eyyy~~
Nokri (Marisa): or a brief period some other day
Nokri (Marisa): my remilia wig and fangs are coming tomorrow. i'm going to cosplay her on the 23rd but I don't know to where because there are multiple cosplay events rip
Aldus (Jess): D:
Nokri (Marisa): Tokyo Game Show which i'm going to on the 22nd as Zelda, or Acosta which Rose is going to. remilia is from a game so both would be suitable
Nokri (Marisa): tgs would be more expensive because $10 entry and $10 cosplay fee, but it's way bigger
Aldus (Jess): youve been to Acosta alot right?
Nokri (Marisa): yee it's a monthly thing
Nokri (Marisa): so i know a few people who go. it's a good and bad thing (good because yay people i follow on twitter, bad because it's usually always the same people if that makes sense)
Nokri (Marisa): the south park yaoi girls will be at tgs but i don't know which day
Bill: Anime New York Festival was the first thing, now it ANYC.
Aldus (Jess): id say TGS for new experience
Bill: I KNEW YOU'D LIKE BLONDE BOI

Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): dibs on that one girl who was playing hard to get with a guy and violet ruined it
Nokri (Marisa): am shopping for katarina supplies. $70 and that doesn't include the fabric hhhhnn

Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Nokri (Marisa): and some other small stuff. but i'm not looking forward to buying the wig/fabric/thermoplastic when i get home.
OH I HAVE BIRTHDAY MONEY FROM LAST YEAR i can use that yehaw. that should cover like. half.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm buying everything i can online now so it's there when i'm home and also shipping takes forever

Bill: Even if I did, I don‚Äôt think people would donate. I don‚Äôt get tips now, for example. (Except when Marisa stuff a dollar in my
Bill: Camera bag).
Bill: And as for goals, cosplay goals are like 100~200, photographer gear is minimum triple that.
Bill: At least where I‚Äôm at.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah if wouldn't be for gear
Elfriede (Tom): Just an easy topping service
Nokri (Marisa): Gots my Katarina crafting supplies ;u;
Nokri (Marisa): Ye that‚Äôs a good idea
Aldus (Jess): YE

Bill: And some people I know the finances, I‚Äôd rather they don‚Äôt you know?
