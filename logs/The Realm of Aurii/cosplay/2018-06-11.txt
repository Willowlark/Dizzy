Aldus (Jess): OH NO
Nokri (Marisa): frick you can see my leotard thing under my skirt in the sitting photos. dang. i was worried about that. probably what he was aiming for
i had shorts on but my shirt is one of those leotard shirts because i can't keep anything tucked in for more than .5 seconds and it was on over the shorts
Nokri (Marisa): "what have our lives come to"
Nokri (Marisa): notice the blank, dark eyes screaming "help"
Aldus (Jess): omg elias plush tho 👌
Bill: and why were you talking to this guy then...?
Nokri (Marisa): free photos <:lenny:395307171539189760>

we were about to leave if it got any weirder
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH she has the official elias plush that thing is like $80
Bill: I'm still on creep patrol from the weekend wandering with Georgia, I saw some guy staring at a butt on the subway platform and I was like 😐
Nokri (Marisa): here you can see the telepathic message being sent between us, "if this goes any further we're stopping"
Bill: that's a really common ship though, Chise x Saber.
Nokri (Marisa): ya
Nokri (Marisa): i see it all the time people love it
Aldus (Jess): ~~i cant tell if you guys are joking~~

Bill: I'm more respecting you took de photos.
Bill: I preconfigured stuff sure, but I don't think...? that changes anything.
Aldus (Jess): LMAO boys keep responding to my "hey kid, wanna join a cult" pic of unknown on my story with "yes im interested" l
Aldus (Jess): Plot twist I was Rika the whole time
Bill: 😏
Bill: You are never living down that hashtag now.
Aldus (Jess): lmao great XD
Bill: <@&455787357426417674>
Afina (Georgia🍀): WE OBEY
Aldus (Jess): OMG 😂
Bill: spekaing of roles, <@!288513265661902858> are you on break or off work?
Eliran (Halim): no work today
Aldus (Jess): finally! lol
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: WE OBEY
Eliran (Halim): new role for jess in BNE
Aldus (Jess): oh no XD
Aldus (Jess): "and thats how i accidentally started a cult when i was just trying to make a reference"
Bill: Ah, so roles in BNE Hal. I can't do this but it needs to be done, I realized it when Ginny invited her Erik in. Every single role has permissions, so everyone can do invite links. We don't need the drama of a scenario where Ginny invites her friend TJ, who is Gen's ex she actively avoids. What you need to do is remove permissions from every role that only exists for the color. The only roles that should give permissions are `everyone`, and Reiley/mine/Georgia's roles because we are intended to have them. Every other role should give no permissions at all, they'll inherit permissions from `everyone`.
Bill: Georgia and I fixed Ginny's roles to not have instant invite to avoid the specific example, but it should be done for everyone.
Bill: God forbid more trouble in BNE.
Eliran (Halim): I'll go through it all in a bit
Bill: I love how Jake and Casey do those little cell phone shoots when they go to day cons.
Afina (Georgia🍀): if anyone needs over the knee socks for stuff
Afina (Georgia🍀): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072XJNJ34/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Afina (Georgia🍀): this brand i used for both my thigh highs all weekend
Afina (Georgia🍀): they were nice and thick and didnt fall down too much, i only pulled them up like once or twice during the whole day
Afina (Georgia🍀): this has been a PSA
Aldus (Jess): now toms gonna order me 14 pairs
Afina (Georgia🍀): hap birth here are 28 socks
Aldus (Jess): he would though
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I would tho
Bill: He did tho
Aldus (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: AaaaAAAALLLLLright.
Bill: I got a notification before Zekani posted to the colossal east group looking for a room.
Bill: I got a DM before I got on the subway from her with a lead in to that.
Bill: “Are you going” and I can infer.
Bill: Uh?
Aldus (Jess): yea i saw that post
Bill: I’ve had two 5 minute conversations with her, and a handful of Instagram exchanges. My inclination is nope if it does go the way I expect.
Aldus (Jess): its your room brah, up to you. we have alot of space still right?
Bill: I mean, right?
Bill: Yeah we do.
Aldus (Jess): ok, i told justin and rayna wed have space if they manage to get off
Aldus (Jess): you dont know her v. well so
Bill: For now. Ashley and Dan was discussed, as is Brandon and Lizi.
Bill: ( <@!279360609416642561> you guys wanna come to colossal east?)
Bill: No I don’t.
Aldus (Jess): yea i mean obvi it would be open forever
Bill: People I don’t know don’t ~~acknowledge~~ ask me for anything, and I can’t imagine rooming with effective strangers personally. So I’m just confirming my reasoning here.
Aldus (Jess): oh yea i wouldnt either if i were you. ned to know someone a lil better or at least have them be friend of a close friend
Bill: Exactly.
Afina (Georgia🍀): whats happenin
Bill: Read.
Afina (Georgia🍀): zeikani needs a room for colossal east?
Bill: yeah.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ehhhh
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i dont know them well enough
Afina (Georgia🍀): i dont think i do at least
Afina (Georgia🍀): tho we are mutuals so im not uncomfortable rooming with them id just rather now
Bill: I turned her down, someone clued her in to a group of people looking for roommates so that should help her.
Bill: Mutuals on instagram is not friendship, certainly not trusting someone to sleep in the same room as you imo.
Bill: #virgo
Aldus (Jess): Omg
Bill: Fuck real photos, I should spend all my time making memes.
Bill: *"I am an abused sad boi"*
Bill: *"But it's what gets me laid!"*
Bill: Can you stop memeing
Afina (Georgia🍀): OMFG
Afina (Georgia🍀): i love these
Bill: Got another, but has spoiler caption.
Bill: That one goes to DM, since you going to play right?
Bill: Did not make it all the way through Friday. Close.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i cant use a song in my vlog cause itll only be the soundtrack for sunday and its too good for that
Bill: Sunday was lit tho. Much more so than the typical Sunday.
Aldus (Jess): Omg these are great
Bill: was just talking to Mom, saying how I take alot of pictures but I took half as many as I did last year at Next. 4000 last year, 2000 this year.
Bill: I want to compare though, I think it's more like I only need half as many photos to get the good ones, rather than I'm getting less good ones.
Bill: Gotta finish the collection set.
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> Ryouma has some *BALLER* shots.
