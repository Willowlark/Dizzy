Nokri (Marisa): now i'm considering getting an airbrush for cosplay. hmm.
does anyone own one. i've been used as a test subject for one once before but never actually used it myself
Aldus (Jess): I have one at my parents? technically its my brothers though. I needed it for commercial art in high school as a requirement. Ive used it but im not good at it. it takes a lot of practice. Ive never used it on people, just paintings
Nokri (Marisa): let the people be your canvas
Nokri (Marisa): are regular airbrushes the same as makeup airbrushes?
if so we had one in shop class in high school to brush sawdust off and it was POWERFUL
Nokri (Marisa): 💪
