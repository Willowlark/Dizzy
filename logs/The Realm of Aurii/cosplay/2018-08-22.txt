Afina (Georgia🍀): SIGH they don't carry the swimsuit in stores
Afina (Georgia🍀): The swimsuit section lady was nice but guest services was ROOD
Bill: You shopping?
Afina (Georgia🍀): YE
Bill: Nice.
Afina (Georgia🍀): No luck, target does carry any red swimsuits for some reason
Afina (Georgia🍀): The only one I found was an XS lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow customer service were such jerks and the one lady working alone to restock swimsuits was so nice
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like she tried to help me find a similar one
Bill: That’s nice.
Bill: Also target is red themed, it’d make since for them to have a red suit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh my god im actually thinking of writing a dissatisfied email
Afina (Georgia🍀): im becoming my mother
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~they ain’t going to read an email~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~theyre a multi million dollar company, they don't give a shit either way, but you might get a coupon~~
Bill: Indeed, you need to talk to someone high enough to do something but still connected to the store in question. Ie store manager.
Bill: Or, let it goooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh i meant the manager
Afina (Georgia🍀): and to be fair id be giving kudos to the nice swimsuit lady that tried to help me find an alternative
Afina (Georgia🍀): _and then rip into the customer service lady_
Bill: Criticism is louder than praise.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like i worked 11 hours today and i did not want the rest of my night to still be treated like a secretary hmp
Bill: I can hear you wag for finger. 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): Y E A H
Afina (Georgia🍀): now imma go hunt for a bikini top not from target

Bill: So basically you two Fourth of July.
Nokri (Marisa): someone said "my new cosplay has a helmet so i can cry and it won't be noticable."
relatable
Nokri (Marisa): so how do y'all store cosplay pictures.
I have a few flash drives with most of my pictures on them, but then every time I want to post from my phone I usually save it as a draft on tumblr and then screenshot it from my phone and it's annoying.
biru's pics are easy because you just have to find them on his site or on flickr and download them directly from there
is there an easier way
Elfriede (Tom): S-store cosplay pictures?
Elfriede (Tom): 👀
Nokri (Marisa): ~~fresh from the cosplay picture store~~

Aldus (Jess): yea that prob what id do
Aldus (Jess): TwoB
Aldus (Jess): V: V lol
Nokri (Marisa): not a lot of good characters that start with b. hm.
Nokri (Marisa): u got it covered <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): does it count if youve only costested?
Nokri (Marisa): sure why not
Aldus (Jess): whoooo!
Aldus (Jess): then i have CC and V <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Nokri (Marisa): i have the memory of a goldfish
Elfriede (Tom): We just weren't cosplayers yet
Elfriede (Tom): So we weren't worthy of remember ing
Nokri (Marisa): [thinks back to anything horrible and embarassing i've done when meeting you before i met you]
Nokri (Marisa): no no u worthy of remembering
i dont even remember who i am
Elfriede (Tom): Hence why you remember JESS AND NOTME
Elfriede (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): sad, ashamed dab

Elfriede (Tom): Just sat in line with you for Uncle yo
Elfriede (Tom): Ye

Nokri (Marisa): OH
Nokri (Marisa): OH YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): OH YEAH
Elfriede (Tom): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): it was dark and i was dying
Elfriede (Tom): Yes
Elfriede (Tom): You were blind!
Elfriede (Tom): Did you have your glasses off
Nokri (Marisa): that was during winter break so i was nocturnal. and i hadn't slept in like 20 hours because i sleep during the day
Elfriede (Tom): I don't remember
Nokri (Marisa): i did when taking pictures. i was in stilettos because i couldn't find my rwby boots and had to improvise
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah!
Aldus (Jess): yea you were rubbies
Elfriede (Tom): We didn't talk much tho, just a few smol jokes
Nokri (Marisa): yee
Elfriede (Tom): Kurtis was there too
Nokri (Marisa): kurtis come talk here more
Nokri (Marisa): i have a friend. she's my high school friend.
i sat next to her in english and PE in our senior year.
it took me like 5 months to realize she was the same person
Nokri (Marisa): i am not good with people <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): OH NO
Aldus (Jess): thats ok its like you had 2 friends
Nokri (Marisa): oh crabcakes how am i supposed to complete a collage of the alphabet if i can't find pictures. oops.
Nokri (Marisa): aha. i found a vintage.
Nokri (Marisa): it very bad i give up
Nokri (Marisa): 10 year old cosplays
back into the abyss you go
Aldus (Jess): SHOW
Nokri (Marisa): nhnnnnn fdzz bad
Nokri (Marisa): what even are wigs
Nokri (Marisa): the outfit itself isn't bad i wonder if i still have it anywhere. i could bring it back
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Aldus (Jess): who dat
Nokri (Marisa): Koyuki from Sgt Frog
what a cute
Nokri (Marisa): i want to do all the Sgt Frog cosplays
Aldus (Jess): DOIT
Nokri (Marisa): oh and she doesn't always wear the blue mask that why i didn't bother making it
Nokri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
I have Natsumi, I just have to actually wear her.
there's koyuki if I can find the outfit (here without the mask)
Nokri (Marisa): momoka's outfit would have to be made, but Mois's would be the hardest. unless i skimp out and do her untransformed version which I basically already have but we want ARMAGEDDON
Nokri (Marisa): wait when you said "who dat" did you mean the character or the person i'm with. oops.
she's a voice actress, trina nishimura. now she's best known for mikasa in attack on titan
Aldus (Jess): OH i meant the character ut OMG mikas
Nokri (Marisa): i did it. into the story it goes. posting here so i don't have to screenshot off of tumblr <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): new cosplay photo storage idea
a personal discord
Afina (Georgia🍀): cosplay sounds so weird in japan
Afina (Georgia🍀): so different
Aldus (Jess): sounds terrifying
Nokri (Marisa): it strange
Elfriede (Tom): It's so popular that they need laws to control it
Nokri (Marisa): even at comiket i was asked to move because swimsuit cosplays had to be hidden deep within comiket's inner cosplay areas and not in the outer cosplay areas
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Elfriede (Tom): America it's a smaller sub culture I feel than Japan, but perhaps I'm wrong
Nokri (Marisa): they have a ton of resources for it, tons of events every month, specialty shops in every major hub, several magazines (just for makeup, just for costumes, etc. etc.) but it's highly policed
Elfriede (Tom): Likw if you could cosplay at the water parks in Japan perhaps there'd be cosplayers everywhere
Nokri (Marisa): there aren't really any "fun" costumes either. it's written in event rules that if a guy wants to dress as a girl he can't have excessive body hair or any facial hair
Nokri (Marisa): o here a picture from the park
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): AHHHHHHHH
Nokri (Marisa): i've been to a cosplay event on the beach once, and it was very strict. we could only go to and from the beach if accompanied by a staff member from the cosplay studio (which was essentially a repurposed apartment turned into photo studio)
Aldus (Jess): OOF
Nokri (Marisa): they had permission to use one little strip of the beach and we absolutely couldn't leave that area or go further down the shore
Aldus (Jess): what happens if u leave?
Aldus (Jess): they shoot u?
Nokri (Marisa): ~~they shoo~~ YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): idk maybe police arrests you
Aldus (Jess): 😱
Elfriede (Tom): That's crazy
Nokri (Marisa): I think it's because of the really horrible association people make between anime and people here. it's kind of double sided. there's a lot of it and it's fine to watch mainstream stuff, lots of people do. but get deeper and you're super weird.
Nokri (Marisa): kid i was speaking with once at musashi: "oh you like anime? me too! what's your favorite?"
me: "oh i watch a lot of stuff. right now the best is akatsuki no yona"
moment of silence, kid starts laughing "oh wow you're an otaku huh"
Aldus (Jess): OOF
Elfriede (Tom): LMAO
Elfriede (Tom): BODIED
Nokri (Marisa): anime fans are associated with murderers and debaucherers so maybe us dressing up like fairies poses a threat
Nokri (Marisa): legit read an article earlier this year about a guy stealing safety whistles that elementary school kids carry around. he would wait in parks and steal the whistles or ask them to blow it for him. when word got out, the news outlets were like "there's an anime....... that has whistles in it............ this man must have seen that anime and gotten a sick fetish for kids whistles and started doing this because of anime"
MAYBE HE'S JUST A FREAK WITHOUT THE ANIME
Aldus (Jess): WHAT OMG thats like people with "video games cause school shootings"
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH japan is like that on a biiig scale
Elfriede (Tom): Omfg
Nokri (Marisa): They’re very strict with picture permission and photography is banned at all non-cosplay events because if someone’s image goes public they could lose their job and whatnot. Peoples faces are always blurred or censored if they’re in the background of an image.
Aldus (Jess): id be terrified yo
Aldus (Jess): like theyll fire people if they find out they're a NERD?
Nokri (Marisa): Ya nerds are obviously very dangerous and an embarrassment to society
Aldus (Jess): could you image doing like really good at your job and your boss calls you in and fires you for for cosplay?
Nokri (Marisa): That Swiss guy with the loli hentai was fired multiple times but also he’s got some issues
Nokri (Marisa): Rather than be fired in japan they “respectfully resign”
Aldus (Jess): "force you to quit?"
Nokri (Marisa): You got it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): WHOO
Elfriede (Tom): 👌 👌
Elfriede (Tom): Wow sounds great
Elfriede (Tom): Sign me up
Aldus (Jess): plz no
Elfriede (Tom): THIS HERE IS A NO FUN ZONE
Bill: Ye fuck Japan and cosplay.
Bill: *Watch it about Tom yesterday*
Elfriede (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): THERES STILL A FADED LINE FROM MY A2 MAKE UP TEST W H A T
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm at work in tank top thing, thank god I brought my work jacket
Bill: Hehe.
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede (Tom): Is that A2 ?!
Elfriede (Tom): Ye I here she works at a car dealership now
Elfriede (Tom): If you don't buy it's said she lifts it and threatens to the the car at you
Afina (Georgia🍀): She took her hate of machines and started being productive
Bill: Until she realizes cars are machines.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Shush don't tell her
