Nokri (Marisa): I‚Äôve always wanted to do a nagiasu cosplay and I found one today for $5. It even comes with manaka‚Äôs fins. 
Fish leg Manaka here I come
Bill: lol
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): H y p e
Nokri (Marisa): I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt fit because it‚Äôs an M and it says it runs small but it‚Äôs actually a perfect fit, could even be a bit smaller. <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>  my back up plan for this was to cosplay lewd chisaki if it didn‚Äôt fit but manaka is a success
Bill: When was chisaki lewd?
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): Trying on her elementary uniform as a college student
Bill: Ooooh right.
Bill: Chisaki was best girl. But the shipping in that show was an exercise of masochism.
Bill: Tldr fuck you PA works.
Nokri (Marisa): But they have nice random slow mo shots <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): Might do chisaki in the US because I have a wig that‚Äôd work and I always feel weird cosplaying elementary schoolers
Bill: Nothing actually happened in 26 episodes.
Bill: I‚Äôm as salty as the fish people.
Nokri (Marisa): They were oppressed and slept a lot
Bill: Oh wait epilogue was good for Chisaki Tsumugu.
Bill: ~~Maybe it‚Äôs just the art the wiki chose, but kinda looks the same despite the time skip through puberty.~~
Bill: 
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): Given time shenanigans I think that‚Äôs the only viable ship
Bill: True. Was best ship.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~her chest is bigger thus she‚Äôs older duh~~
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): ^^^^
Bill: ~~*That and her hair is the only difference, why does the fourteen year old have the body of a 19 year old*~~
Aldus (Jess): y she got tit at all
Bill: Sinners.
Bill: Chisaki was the ‚Äúmature older girl‚Äù trope, but still.
Nokri (Marisa): Literally in that everyone stayed a kid except her <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): she was the fanservice that's why they aged her <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): the show was pretty tho
Nokri (Marisa): i always assumed manaka's fins were real.... but..... are they earrings? ü§î 
looking back at the OP they act like earrings and the accessories i got are earring-esque (japan has earrings that clamp around your ear because very few people have pierced ears)
Bill: Well, the *Isupposethere'snobetterword* plot for her aging made sense.
Bill: Like, Nagi was the only PA works show I liked. I'd never watch another PA works, or even Nagi again though.
Nokri (Marisa): i hear hibike euphomium is decent i've been meaning to watch it. they continue with the random slowmo
Nokri (Marisa): didn't you like angel beats
Nokri (Marisa): they worked with key on that
Bill: Angel Beats predates PA work's obession with drama series.
Bill: I believe, when did Hanasaku Iroha come out?
Nokri (Marisa): 2011-2013
Bill: AB was in the middle of that, so the theory half stands.
Nokri (Marisa): wait they didn't do hibike. who did that then. hm.
Bill: Kyoto.
Nokri (Marisa): OH duh yeah
Bill: It has all of Kyoto's things, 
> cute girls
> no men
> Yuri undertones
> high school
> only doing cute things
> everyone plays an instrument
Bill: ~~throwback to when Kyoto animation did things that weren't crap~~
Nokri (Marisa): oo does someone play flute i could do that
Nokri (Marisa): gotem
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): that'd be a cool thursday cosplay. i could play flute in line for badges assuming they don't kick me out
Nokri (Marisa): i also have to do a kotomi clannad cosplay with my violin
Nokri (Marisa): can just reuse fuko's outfit
Nokri (Marisa): swap the patch
Bill: Mawisa.
Nokri (Marisa): *i need*
Nokri (Marisa): it's like air to me
Bill: Given you had access to your closet at home.
Bill: How many days could you wear a school uniform in a row, without rewearing an outfit and without doing laundry?
Nokri (Marisa): want me to check
Nokri (Marisa): only unique school uniforms that are official to a show?
Bill: Sure.

Bill: Yeah. That's a thing.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: I've noticed that as well, ~~is passed puberty but boobies get bigger anyways if they become a full adult~~
Nokri (Marisa): it's how anime girls age
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Hinata is a prime example
Nokri (Marisa): hinata's hair got longer too owo
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: COINCIDENCE?!
Nokri (Marisa): they have really nice violet evergarden costumes for sale but they're $160 used so nah
Bill: ye fuck that.
Bill: violet got a cool as heck outfit, but 160.
