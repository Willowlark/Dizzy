Afina (Georgia🍀): Okay so since I'm ditching the complex A2 idea cause I don't have the monies to spend ~~and wouldn't wear the swimsuit again~~, I'm just wearing the bikini
Afina (Georgia🍀): Which leaves the question of how to do the lines
Afina (Georgia🍀): SO I did a make up test cause I was curious on how thicc to make the lines
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~this is just a swimsuit but Idk if I should put it in nsfw so I will ~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I did this for funsies
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then I realized that Homestuck was too present on the board for me to want to post LMAO
Afina (Georgia🍀): THEY ALSO FORGOT W
Aldus (Jess): i cant do that, there clearly arnt any numbers on there
Bill: LOL
Aldus (Jess): T: TwoB?
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao yea
Bill: Purple: a foreign language.
Aldus (Jess): Yes
Aldus (Jess): When will insta get text formatting 😭
Bill: Never, instagram is intentionally feature starved.
Bill: It’s a shit platform.
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): I was thinking about how RT said they were releasing new Pyrrha and Ren pajama designs with the next Grimm Eclipse update
Afina (Georgia🍀): But they never said exactly when that update was dropping
Afina (Georgia🍀): So now I'm just like _it could be any day now_
Afina (Georgia🍀): You know that I'm gonna start the cosplay as soon as it drops
Bill: Grimm Eclipse will never get love.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Except for the one day the pajamas are released lmao
Bill: it... won't get love.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I was gonna wear a bikini for Pyrrha but I like the swimsuit anyways?
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I get lifeguard vibes which Pyrrha would totally be
Bill: Maybe, but I’d worry people would ask if you’re cosplaying baywatch.
Eliran (Halim): How hard would it be to put a logo or something on it
Eliran (Halim): Cause if you could get pyrrhas symbol or something on the front that'd be cool
Bill: Oooh, no, that’d completely nail the lifeguard feel.
Bill: But, Kirsten has been making her shinon swimsuit so she might know how to paint it in.
Eliran (Halim): Yeah the life guard feel would be perfect for pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeaaah but I don't wanna ruin the suit I'd probably wear normally anyways
Afina (Georgia🍀): Swim and drink con is casual anyways so fuk it
Bill: Tangentially, make sure to bring something with you to wear walking to the waterfall when we take photos. It’ll probably be chillier than just a bikini weather.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Besides my soon to be "Great One" shirt? 😂
Bill: I was thinking A2.
Bill: I know you’ve got clothes for Pyrrha planned.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I could make a yorha sucks shirt
Bill: Sure? Just something to stay warm. The con center can be cold iirc and going outside and walking to the waterfall may be as well. September and all that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hoodie JNPR rises again
