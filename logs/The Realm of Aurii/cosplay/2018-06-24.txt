Nokri (Marisa): Am back from cosplay. Could only fit 4 costumes in my bag so today was 4 costume day.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That's awesome thought looks like you were super busy with it
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Was it expensive?
Nokri (Marisa): It was free! One of the cosplay events we attended before had a coupon for 1 free day (10.5 hours) at one of three studios <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> otherwise it would’ve cost around $40 because Sunday. It would only be around $25 for a full day, we’ll probably go again and just do an hour or two in the evening when it’s not so crowded. The morning was pretty popular and everyone took turns in the different areas
Bill: 40 isn't even that much.
Nokri (Marisa): I did pay $5 for really bad batteries that died in under an hour because I forgot to pack extras and didn’t think the ones they sold would suck so much <:lenny:395307171539189760> but for the experience it’s not bad at all
Nokri (Marisa): Ye especially for that long. Free lockers too which was really nice.
Bill: That'd be great if you could get it here.
Bill: ~~just now realizes Mawisa took a picture of handcuffs and cat ears~~
Nokri (Marisa): Also they played really good music. The kyoukai no Kanata theme played when I dressed as Mirai and they played Problem Children music
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): Was gonna post this on Instagram in a few days
What am I, a maid? Pssh
Nokri (Marisa):
