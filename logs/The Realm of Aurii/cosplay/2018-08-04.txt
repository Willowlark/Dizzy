Afina (Georgia🍀): They started kicking people out of upstairs at 6 to close the con, but let me stay on the stairway to shoot photos with a photographer
Afina (Georgia🍀): Even when they yelled at other people to stay off the stairs
Afina (Georgia🍀): And now they're closing the venue so they're kicking people out of the building
Bill: At 6? How lame.
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I was like "oh my ride is just coming" and they let me stay, and then kicked out the guy across the hall from me who said the SAME thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeaahhhh they have security metal detectors (that I don't think they work tbh cause my metal corset nor metal magnets set it off)
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I guess they only contracted the detectors from 9-6
Bill: Sounds shitty.
Bill: Also yes, you’re going to get away with stuff when you’ve got looks.
