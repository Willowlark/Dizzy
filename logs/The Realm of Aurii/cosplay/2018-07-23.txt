Afina (Georgia🍀): i was looking for a photo of lissy and me to post for her birthday
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): throwback
Bill: Her birthday is tomorrow. In case you missed the story telling people.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH PHEW well ill have it for tomorrow then
Bill: apparently people think it's today?
Aldus (Jess): He sleep
Eliran (Halim): Yall
Eliran (Halim): I think I'm about to be proxy giving Erik advice
Elfriede (Tom): OMG DAS ME
Eliran (Halim): Cause Nathan messaged me about how Erik was fretting over something he wanted to give the girl he liked
Eliran (Halim): And I gave nathan advice about it, and I'm pretty sure he just turned around and gave Erik the same advice
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao solid proxy advice
Bill: Yeah, that's Nathan's MO.
Aldus (Jess): Nicu
Eliran (Halim): 
Eliran (Halim): /shrug
Bill: Screen cap doesn't really add anything mate.
Eliran (Halim): It was the immediate intense response
Eliran (Halim): Also I think I have a suspicion of who Erik's crush is now
Eliran (Halim): But I shan't say more till I can tell if the advice I gave was used
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): The age old mystery
Bill: Or maybe Nathan is doing the old 'asking for a friend' and is really talking about asking out Meg.
Aldus (Jess): He like Meg? 😮
Bill: Nathan? Ye.
Bill: She isn't into him.
Aldus (Jess): RIP
Eliran (Halim): Oh no its definitely Erik and his lady love if my guess is right
And yeah meg is wayyyyy not interested in Nathan
Eliran (Halim): The whole conversation started with him wanting to smack erik
Aldus (Jess): 😮 wuuuuut
Aldus (Jess): y tho
Bill: I'd say it's a shame, after all the Mist stuff he seems like a good guy, but I can hear the Ethan in the back of mind saying 'nice guys always finish last Bill'.
Eliran (Halim): If I were to wager a few reason Shes not interested because hes messaging her to much, and lives to far away
Eliran (Halim): The physical aspect might have some part as well
Bill: Plenty of good reasons. Guy's a little heavy handed, he bought her RTX plane ticket or something?
Eliran (Halim): Yep
Bill: I just mean could do worse. Like Ethan!
Eliran (Halim): And that was like right after they met in person for the first time
Bill: Yeeeee noooooo.
Eliran (Halim): Yeeee
Eliran (Halim): Also in response to nice guys finish last 
Ethan definitely finished below nathan so it's not true lol
Bill: mmm tru.
Bill: I just like lampshading that he unironically said the phrase.
Eliran (Halim): Lol
Aldus (Jess): is nathan the one with the blue hair?
Bill: think so. myrealmaincharacter.
Aldus (Jess): ye
Aldus (Jess): y he wanna hit erik?
Bill: Erik likely being wishy washy.
Eliran (Halim): Oh for being stupid about what I ended up giving him advice about
Aldus (Jess): oooo so not actually wanna hit him
Afina (Georgia🍀): Somehow working on cosplay I burned my elbow
Afina (Georgia🍀): Most people burn their hands but me? Nope
Eliran (Halim): sounds like typical cosplay work
Afina (Georgia🍀): It hurts way more than my hands ever could oof
Elfriede (Tom): oof on what OoO
Afina (Georgia🍀): The hot glue gun
Afina (Georgia🍀): I elbowed into it and boom burn
