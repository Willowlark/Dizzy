Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I can't figure out what skin that is in the back right
Aldus (Jess): how she make a keyboard pool float?
Bill: might have bought it.
Bill: I can imagine some site made thsoe.
Nokri (Marisa): is it a real pool float? :0 hard to tell 100%
Aldus (Jess): i think so? cut it bubble at the top
Nokri (Marisa): tru. that can be done with plastic too. there's an odd seam at the side but now that i look at it again it's likely the wire that holds it up when posing
Bill: Fuck.
Bill: New Problem: The jpaden photo is good.
Bill: Too good.
Aldus (Jess): That's not a problem Billiam
Bill: ~~it is for me~~
Bill: wait no the white balance is funky, and it's technically oversharpened even if it's passiable.
Bill: Eyes just look really good.
Bill: crisis averted.
Aldus (Jess): That's like me saying " oh that 2b cosplay is so good that's a problem"
Bill: It's not a problem THAT photographer took a better shot than I could. It's a problem that I haven't taken a better shot than THAT yet.
Bill: no ill will to the other guy.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I think it's the same thing 😂
Aldus (Jess): Ye!
Bill: I find motivation to improve, rather than feel the other guy has wronged me by being better.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^ that makes sense
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think the eyes are edited tho
