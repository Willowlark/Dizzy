Nokri (Marisa): *everyone knows you donâ€™t have to call me out like this*
Nokri (Marisa): Who called you ugly
Who did that Iâ€™m gonna beat them up
Nokri (Marisa): i was gonna cosplay mirai tomorrow but my confidence for her is shot now even after fixing the wig up a bit haha rip i'm gonna be saber instead
Elfriede (Tom): What that fuck who says that
Elfriede (Tom): What's different than her hair? Looks the same to.me
Elfriede (Tom): I would have blocked them, damn how rude
Nokri (Marisa): hibiju.cosplays says that <:lenny:395307171539189760>
i think my wig is too pink and not floofy enough but it was like $3 because i already have a ton of junk to take home and i don't want to invest in a proper wig that i'd have to mail back for the same cost as buying a new one. it's passable though, and in a lot of the art her hair is pink-pink.
Nokri (Marisa): i threw a ton of baby powder on it so it looks closer to her anime hair color but floof will be difficult to achieve without a hair dryer
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah damn WHHHHHOOOOO SAYYYYS THATTTT
Elfriede (Tom): EVEN IF IT WAS WAY OFF
Elfriede (Tom): Which it's not
Elfriede (Tom): Damn so many idiots out there today
Nokri (Marisa): https://data.whicdn.com/images/238768667/original.gif
Elfriede (Tom): The most relatable thing she does ðŸ‘Œ
Aldus (Jess): I will fight this person ðŸ¤œ
Nokri (Marisa): aurii high school fight club
Aldus (Jess): Yea!
Bill: Late but this person is a dumbass, cosplay what you wanted to Marisa.
Nokri (Marisa): i just finished ironing saber and washing her wig. it'll be better that way probably because non-japanese character at a japanese event.
Nokri (Marisa): omg I *think* this ticket comes with a free pass to ride all the rides in costume? Maybe? It says all-you-can-ride attractions but I dunno if thatâ€™s a title or if we can really ride everything for free but *saber on a merry go round*
Aldus (Jess): OMG yes
