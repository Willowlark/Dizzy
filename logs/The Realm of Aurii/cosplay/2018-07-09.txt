Bill: It’s good!
Aldus (Jess): It is.... Ok 😂 could have been better, could have been worse
Afina (Georgia🍀): at least you closed the edges honestly so many noras have fraying fabric
Afina (Georgia🍀): and im like oh noes your hearts gonna unravel
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~wow thats really poetic i should save that line for play by post~~
Aldus (Jess): Oh yea lol that wouldn't work for a bathing suit I cleaned it up a little and now I'm fray checking it? Considering going around the edges with fabric glue?
Afina (Georgia🍀): both couldnt hurt
Afina (Georgia🍀): itll harden the fabric so it may be a little scritchy
Afina (Georgia🍀): if you care about that kinda thing
Aldus (Jess): nah, my regular nora shirt has it too, so  just did that and ill let it dry over night. Its not very pretty close up but i think itll be fine from a distance
Aldus (Jess): o also the black list there, thats just my bra i didnt feel like taking off
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sometimes I'm like "yo I look the same in every cosplay picture" but then I realize that's because I recognize my own darn face
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cause looking between Weiss and Pyrrha, my expressions are VERY different
Elfriede (Tom): Yup, thats still me
Elfriede (Tom): not different enough
Elfriede (Tom): *not enough gray skin*
Nokri (Marisa): amen

Nokri (Marisa): i like the second link a lot
Aldus (Jess): yea i def wanna go with the second link im just unsure on color
Nokri (Marisa): if yellow doesn't work the roses are pretty neat
Aldus (Jess): i love the yellow but idk if itll look ok with my hair 😮
Bill: Could do Pink and then you have a 50's Nora dress.
Aldus (Jess): lol is that a thing?
Bill: I dunno <@!245270932602486784> , is 50's!JNPR a thing?
Nokri (Marisa): i wore the red spotted one at the otakon matsuri a few years back as a casual ladybug and even when i took the wig off people were like "nice ladybug cosplay"
Aldus (Jess): oo i could to the yellow with my blue polka dot heels and headband
Afina (Georgia🍀): _jnps aus are always a thing_

Aldus (Jess): I WANNA GO HOME AND WORK ON CCE BATHING SUIT BLAAA
Bill: I wanna stop thinking!
Nokri (Marisa): what the plan for cce 2019
Bill: we go... swim... drink.
Bill: boom.
Bill: Same plan we have every year.
Nokri (Marisa): don't drink the pool water
Nokri (Marisa): i'd like to do a swimsuit cosplay for a katsucon but then i remember when the whole place was evacuated and that one poor girl in a bikini with wings so she couldn't wear a jacket. sad.
Nokri (Marisa): katsu's pool is usually deserted isn't it
Nokri (Marisa): except for people jumping in in kigurumi
Nokri (Marisa): here it is my future cosplay
Dizzy: Oh I know dropped the ban hammer somewhere around here...
Bill: !ban Marisa
Nokri (Marisa): this could be us
Aldus (Jess): i didnt even realise katsu had a pool till sunday
Nokri (Marisa): did u go in
Aldus (Jess): nah it was too late by then
Aldus (Jess): also i couldn't figure out how you got to it?
Nokri (Marisa): it's outdoors i think right? like not an outdoor pool but i know there's an entrance outside. it probably connects indoors somehow too but that's a mystery.
Aldus (Jess): yea thats what i couldnt figure out, i also didnt have a suit
Aldus (Jess): should I attempt to do 2b's cutouts on my bathing suit top?
Aldus (Jess): i did the heart for nora and its ok, but i sewed to fast and that was my downfall
Aldus (Jess): i have a hard time controlling the speed 😅
Afina (Georgia🍀): need me one of those full body tights for A2 oh boy
Nokri (Marisa): omg the girl cosplaying discord-chan's boyfriend is cosplaying wumpus
Bill: just spend 3 hours tattooing yourself, like the homestuck you are.
Aldus (Jess): none of ya'll answered my question 😭
Nokri (Marisa): homestuck pool cosplay confirmed
Bill: Do you want to ?
Bill: Do it Jess.
Nokri (Marisa): my only experience with nier is watching brownman play it on youtube
Nokri (Marisa): aji wo [k]utta
Aldus (Jess): i want to but am scare
Nokri (Marisa): yolo do it
Bill: I'd say something more motivational than that, but I don't have the positivity.
Bill: tldr yolo do it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): swimsuits scare me but BE CONFIDENT
Bill: she's scared of the sewing.
Aldus (Jess): ye
Aldus (Jess): i am not good at the sewing machine
Aldus (Jess): yet
Nokri (Marisa): do you guys like evangelion. i have an evangelion swimsuit and they're pretty cheap. someday we could do a rei/asuka/mari group
Nokri (Marisa): these things
Aldus (Jess): every time i sew i manage to jam  the machine cuz im dumb
Aldus (Jess): i only saw the first movie i think
Nokri (Marisa): :0
what jams? the needle or the bobbin?
Aldus (Jess): the bobbin i think
Aldus (Jess): its my own fault cuz im a mess
Nokri (Marisa): might be the tension
Aldus (Jess): i end up with like 4 threads at the bottom 😂
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!! do you ever get a birds nest i get them all the time because my tension gets messed up
Aldus (Jess): you and georgia would probably cry watching my sew
Nokri (Marisa): "great thankss"
Aldus (Jess): YEA that!!
Aldus (Jess): its terrible
Aldus (Jess): and then i never know how to tell weather the bobbin is threaded or not so i end up sewing nothing alot 😅
Nokri (Marisa): usually that means tension is too loose, there's a knob on the side of the machine that chanGEYEAH THE SEWING NOTHING I HATE THAT
Nokri (Marisa): OR WHEN IT RUNS OUT
Bill: I'mma keep deleting messages where you insult yourself Jess, ok, oky.
Nokri (Marisa): you start fine and sew a huge part all carefully only to find out that the first 3 stitches made it and everything else was nothing
Aldus (Jess): YEA I HATE THAT
Nokri (Marisa): and if it's a sensitive fabric then you have *holes*
Nokri (Marisa): that's why satin is satan
Aldus (Jess): YEA omg its teriable
Aldus (Jess): the first this i ever sewed was satin RIP
Nokri (Marisa): horror story
Aldus (Jess): have you ever sewed a bating suit?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah but i've never taken it into water. i've sewed a leotard that could probably work as a bathing suit, and nowi's top was a bathing suit that i modified but i never went into the water with it
Aldus (Jess): oooo ok neat
Aldus (Jess): i was going to rip out the stitches and try again but i dont think its a good idea with that material
Nokri (Marisa): mmm yeah maybe not best unless you do it super carefully
Nokri (Marisa): what kind of stitch do you use for your bathing suit fabric?
Aldus (Jess): yea i think ill just go with what i got.
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Aldus (Jess): i dun know! the regular kind? 🕹
Nokri (Marisa): use a zigzag! zigzag stitches are best for stretchy fabric!
I dunno about cut-outs though, i've never tried it. for the seams definitely use zigzag if you can, but if the cutouts don't stretch then a straight stitch could work
Aldus (Jess): It looks like this, well I cleaned it up a little more but yea that stichings a mess 😂
Nokri (Marisa): oooo is nice!!
Aldus (Jess): i also fabric glued around the edge after that
Nokri (Marisa): lemme check my eva swimsuit and see what stitches that uses
Aldus (Jess): thank! i went in blind so i guess its not too bad for first try
Nokri (Marisa): oh it's serged
Nokri (Marisa): ye!! did you machine stitch or hand?
Nokri (Marisa): machine?
Aldus (Jess): machine XD
Aldus (Jess): i went to fast alot of the time
Nokri (Marisa): gotta go fast
nyooom
Aldus (Jess): i think from a distance itll look fine tho
Nokri (Marisa): ye it looks fine
Aldus (Jess): ill prob try on the whole thing tonight to get a better idea
Nokri (Marisa): do you have a serger because those things are beautiful
Aldus (Jess): i dun think so
Nokri (Marisa): BoJo usually has a ton of sergers i'll see how many spares she has. they're ancient though.
they're super helpful for hems. only thing is they cut as they sew, which can be both helpful and a pain
Nokri (Marisa): they look leik dis
Aldus (Jess): oh no i def dont have that
Aldus (Jess): i have just dis: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VWXZKG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Nokri (Marisa): **heavy duty**
Aldus (Jess): i dont even know how to use most of the features, tom knows alot more than me
Nokri (Marisa): the machine i use has a ton of fun stitches i want to use
i think i used flower stitches for bunny lucina but they're inside so you can't see them rip
Nokri (Marisa): tom the sewing guy
Nokri (Marisa): ooo tension knob's on the top there
Aldus (Jess): he knows mashines i know patterns, with out powers combined we can sew something
Nokri (Marisa): *that's it that's your magical girl power*
Aldus (Jess): ooo ok ill have to look at that
Aldus (Jess): does the serger put in like 4 stitches at a time? 😮
Nokri (Marisa): yeah!
Aldus (Jess): whoa
Aldus (Jess): i should be able to manage at least her booby cutout at the bottom, unsure about the rest https://twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NieR-Automata-600x338.jpg
Aldus (Jess): the cutouts are pretty in depth
Bill: If you only go for the boob window, you could move it up a bit too. Given 2B's is a *tad* low.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): trueeee
Aldus (Jess): thanks for coming to my cosplay rant <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): 10/10 would purchase tickets for again
Bill: That wasn't a rant.
Nokri (Marisa): ^
Aldus (Jess): brainstorm?
Bill: sure, rants are angsty ~~and probably really annoying~~.
Nokri (Marisa): also before i sleep, biru, Nobel is making actual shirts of the shark shirt that nakano wears
Bill: Pfft.
Bill: Get it.
Bill: Mousou shoot the sequel.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm sure the bunny RWBY Sunday of RTX is a good social outing, but I nor Pyrrha is honesty bunny material??
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's a shame I'll lose out on socializing with all those people cause of it tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like I'd still love to know the real Casey
Aldus (Jess): why wouldnt she be? i mean dont stress yourself you arent interested in it but i dont see a reason why she couldnt be
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean I get that the idea is fun
Bill: You aren't comfortable in that type of outfit. That's all there is to it.
Bill: Go hang out to support her if you want to do that, but don't feel pressured into trying to do the outfit.
Bill: I dunno if you'll ever know real Casey tho. I feel like that's a very well guarded secret.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean bunnies are kinda just arm candy aren't they?
Bill: Bunny girl is a fetish outfit.
Bill: like french maids.
Aldus (Jess): i mean under that asumption none of the RWBY girls fit the bill
Eliran (Halim): Bunny girl by definition doesn't go with rwby
Eliran (Halim): except for literal bunny girl velvet
Bill: Bunny girls itself came from Playboy bunnies, and this shoot comes from Mojojoj.
Aldus (Jess): yeet
Bill: Mojojo provided all the concept art, which makes it easy for people to coordinate and do. Casey already did it for Easter, which is probably why she ran with it.
Bill: And of course, fanboys will love it so more followers for all the instagram famous people.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Cursed sex sells
Bill: *any* sex sells.
Bill: You ain't about that and that's fine.
Aldus (Jess): yea like i dont think any of the rwby girls fit bunnies, but pyrrha doesn't fit any less then the others
Bill: Go, be supportive, but you can stick to the clothes you're comfortable in.
Bill: ~~if you had to run around in a fetish outfit, you'd somehow manage to hate RTX even more~~
Aldus (Jess): just stick some bunny ears one and be like "there i did it"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lmao yeah that!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk I feel like I'm no fun cause everyone else seems to really like the idea
Aldus (Jess): dont do it if you arnt passionate about it you'd probably still be able to go to the meetup
Bill: It's a sexy type outfit. You aren't for sexy, you like powerful.
Afina (Georgia🍀): you know me so well billiam, thats so true 😭
Bill: Different tastes for different people.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~powerful woman are my type of sexy already~~
Bill: ^
Aldus (Jess): ~~still no mutally exclusive <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> ~~
Bill: I mean, the cross would be Panther from Persona and she already said she doesn't want to be ~~a dominatrix catgirl~~ cat woman.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _dominatrix catgirl_ omg
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah idk i feel like im limiting myself by not cosplaying on the "sexier" spectrum
Bill: You aren't.
Bill: Period.
Aldus (Jess): you cosplay what you want
Elfriede (Tom): Like,you can if you want to but you cosplay who you want
Bill: You will *hate* being uncomfortable on the floor because you aren't happy in the outfit. Cosplay what you want and what you like.
Elfriede (Tom): Speaking of which your giant inflatable hammer came in
Aldus (Jess): now if you find that you want to cosplay that is "sexy" and you feel comfortable, then dont limit yourself becuase its not a things youve done before
Aldus (Jess): WHOO
Bill: Georgia likes being her badass ~~redheads~~ girls with weapons and strong personalities, particularly with her squad behind her. That's what you should do. Don't think you have to be sexy cause everyone else.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i guess. im always back and forth on it because i dont WANNA do sexier type cosplays, but i wonder if im limiting myself and thereby missing out on possible fun
Afina (Georgia🍀): like i refuse to do panther, but that could be fun?
Afina (Georgia🍀): or the bunnies?
Afina (Georgia🍀): like i wonder sometimes if its a comfort zone worth breaking
Aldus (Jess): only do them if you want too, you'll have more fun being confident in yourself anyway
Elfriede (Tom): ~~I don't think panther looks good personally~~
Bill: ~~she doesn't~~
Aldus (Jess): you could try to break out of it if its something you feel the need to do
Bill: And if you want to, don't announce it or anything. Make it, wear it yourself, and if you feel confident, then say you're bringing out a new outfit.
Aldus (Jess): i mean 2b was way outside my comfort zone at the time
Aldus (Jess): or dont even make it, just borro w something to test it out
Bill: ~~You just like being sexy Jess~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): i didnt know that though, until i tried it
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^ thats what im wondering if i should be doing
Afina (Georgia🍀): but i also dont wanna be sitting around the con center with da tit and da booty feeling miserable
Bill: Bottom line, do not feel like you have to do a sexy outfit cause other instagram people are. If you're doing it, do it for yourself and your own confidence.
Afina (Georgia🍀): MEH thats solid advice that i really cant argue with, damn u bill
Aldus (Jess): well if you want to test it the thats fine but dont feel pressured too
Aldus (Jess): a2 is p. sexy so theres that
Bill: True, depending on how you make A2.
Bill: You haven't done much swimsuit cosplay right?
Bill: CCE can kinda be a test for you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah A2 may be pushing the envelope in a way, but im comfortable with that cause shes gonna be fun to wear
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah the more i think about it A2 may be a good way to test the waters in a way
Bill: Like, if you wore the bikini to the rwby shoot and like it, you might enjoy getting some more sexy outfits in.
Bill: It's not like you won't be among friends there if you change your mind.
Afina (Georgia🍀): tru
Afina (Georgia🍀): alright yeah i feel better now
Afina (Georgia🍀): A2 is a good test of what im comfortable showing
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause i could be canon accurate with ROBO THONG or adopt it to be a little more conservative
Afina (Georgia🍀): and either way, A2 will look awesome
Bill: Most people make Nier more conservative tbh.
Eliran (Halim): ~~makes a bunny suit oz so we have an excuse to be there~~
Aldus (Jess): DO IT HAL omg amazing
Aldus (Jess): i mean?? alot of people amke 2b more lewd then she is
Afina (Georgia🍀): theres probably both sides of the spectrum
Aldus (Jess): like the shorten that skirt so much
Afina (Georgia🍀): ive seen A2s with basically a sports bra and some with an Ilya-type outfit
Bill: Yup.
Aldus (Jess): yea true
Aldus (Jess): i wouldnt saw it more one way then the other, people just do what they want
Bill: ~~the ones who shorten the skirt are the ones with patreons~~
Aldus (Jess): which is what you should do
Elfriede (Tom): There was a TwoB walking around katsu we the no skirt so
Bill: fine, *I have seen* people make Nier more conservative.
Bill: Happy?
Afina (Georgia🍀): self destruct cosplay lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): if she wasnt limping she wasnt REAL
Elfriede (Tom): She only.limp for.like 10 seconds
Elfriede (Tom): Then she fine for some reason
Afina (Georgia🍀): walked it off, its all good
Bill: Self repair or whatever.
