Bill: The bishop turns to Aldus, his eyes sharp and accusatory. "Lady Enera is the Cardinal's star student. She is well carried for and enjoys her days here. That is however, also none of your concern." he says with a dry edge to his voice. He looks between Aldus and Desii once more before turning back to his work.
Bill: !ghost Desii backs down at the bishops second glare. She trails after Aldus as he turns on his heel, her hands wringing the hem of her shirt. She doesn't say anything until Aldus breaks the ice, saying "Perhaps we should speak to Princess Tyndall? Or even Sir Faun? Assuming our next meeting with him goes better then my first, I’d imagine one of them would have a better idea on how to navigate this situation then either of us would.”

Desii nods once. She didn't imagine they'd be so *defensive* when she asked to speak to Enera. What's the difference from Desii waiting in the library for Enera to happen by? She only wanted to meet Enera, not... Desii can't even imagine what kind of person a response like that is meant to keep away. She knew she didn't deserve that kind of response though!

Shaking her head to get out of the haze in her head she looks to Aldus. Half a dozen thoughts come to mind of how to circumvent the man, talking to someone else, waiting to see if they can coincidently bump into Enera, sneaking about, and more. Talking to the Princess didn't come to mind though. 

"Would she be willing to do that for us? We barely know her, even if Eliran and her and friends..." She says as the step off the staircase, back to the first floor.
