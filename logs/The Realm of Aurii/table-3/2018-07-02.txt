“I-Well I’m not positive. She seems generous enough after last night, and she gave you this lead in the first place. Perhaps she knows more? I’m sure a princess’s request would go further than ours.” Aldus scratches his newly-naked chin and thinks, the smooth skin feeling awkward in his hand. “I believe she mentioned she is also a light mage. Maybe they will have lessons together?” He sighs heavily and looks at Desii pointedly. “I’m sorry we couldn't see her today, I know this means alot to you. At least we know she *is* here, now it’s just a matter of getting around bureaucracy.”
