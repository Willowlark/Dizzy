Afina (Georgia🍀): Having finished her training session, Afina had retired to her room to ready herself for the rest of the day. She re-tied her hair into a neat bow, strapped her sword to her side, and changed into her traveling clothes. The princess figured that she would spend some time walking around the market; Perhaps if she was lucky, she would bump into Elfriede. _Or unlucky,_ she thought, remembering their encounter last night. The Laeran shook her head. She had to give Elfriede time to sort out his private matters. Forcing an intimate encounter would not end well for anyone._And a liason with an Eraian would arise some suspicion should word reach Callora about Elfriede_, Afina sighed. For the first time, she was beginning to feel grateful that they had cut short their intimate encounter. _I should have considered the consequences more before rushing into it_.

Afina quickly exited her room, pulling the door shut gracefully behind her. She began to mull over the events that had occurred in the training room. At the end of it all, the bishop had seemed impressed. “Thank Archon that I didn’t let my distracts get the better of me,” she said quietly, head lowered as she walked down the hallway. Even still… Afina had always conjured spells because she _knew_ that she could. She was a Laeran, the most knowledgeable of all ethnicities, taught by a gifted Eraian, the country that pioneered light magic. Of _course_ she could do it. Even still, only a fool would ignore the connection between her detonation spell and her memories of Elfriede in peril. The princess decided she would investigate later.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The Callorian turned a corner. _Perhaps I can find Eliran and seek counse--_ “Oh!” Afina exclaimed stopping short of colliding with two individuals. “Pardon,” she said, before she realized who she had almost run into. The two that had travelled with Eliran… Afina frowned as she tried to remember their names. “Ah, traveling without Eliran? A wise move, he is _quite_ the distraction,” Afina smiled, resting her hand on the hilt of her sword passively. She suddenly realized that she was mimicking Elfriede and straightened her back, hands shifting to rest at her sides. “Princess Afina Tyndall of Laera in the kingdom of Callora. Might I ask what you both are up to?”
Bill: Desii looks up to Aldus, the Naissankari apologizing to her for not being able to help. 

"It's not like it's your fault AldU-"  Desii says before stumbling to stop short of running into another woman rounding the corner. She pulls on Aldus's shirt to keep from toppling into the other person, hastily righting herself and sending a sheepish look to Aldus.

"Oh my, Princess Tyndall!" Desii half exclaims, half whispers as she realizes who she almost headbutted. "Apologies, and a pleasure to see you again." Desii says with a short curtsey. "I suppose... we were looking for you?" she adds with a light smile.
