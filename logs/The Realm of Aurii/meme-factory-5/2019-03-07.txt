Bill: *what do you mean, it's the same thing*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can't wait to get the new game and nickname all of my pokemon Scottish insults
Bill: I just want more fanart.
Bill: Or a *cosplayer yelling in scottish*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "GO GET 'EM YA COO!"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And name my rival "F*ckin C*nt"
Bill: Weird thing, I've listened to Jim Jefferies so much C*nt doesn't... bother me anymore, really. It's apparently in standard use ala shit, fuck in Australia so he uses it all the time and...
Bill: yeah.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I more so censored it as an example because the game won't let you
Bill: lol true.
Bill: But it is still taboo in the states.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): In public, yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): When I'm playing Mario Kart, Mario Party, or Super Smash with friends... no
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea cunt def jars me when I hear it
Bill: Yea, as much as I know I don't mean anything by it I'm not going to let it become a part of my vocab.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I try not to say it too much around people
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But sometimes I'm oblivious to what I say and it comes out so I apologize in advance if it slips out
Bill: lol trust me, I say enough stupid shit I won't judge you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah it's not a big deal it's just not one I'm used to
