N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): HES PERFECT
N🆗ri (Marisa): I forgot deltarune was on switch
That has to be played on switch at some point
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH NO EVEN THE LOADING SCREEN IS CUTE EVERYTHING IS SO AESTHETIC
N🆗ri (Marisa): And the voices are in Japanese and the singer is by the woman who sings the Yona theme songs yes I rate this game 10/10
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YO REALLY
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's like how c.c.s voice actor sings.one of her themes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It neet
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Or Aya and haruhi but that ones obvious
Aldus Larian (Jess): NICE
N🆗ri (Marisa): first impressions is that the game is really cute and pretty much exactly what i expected <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> 
it's very linear and you have limited actions. most of it has been like a story so far where it's just pictures and narration. gameplay is super simple puzzle platformer, it's basically one huge escort mission and the story is a very typical fairy tale.

the little details are really cute though. the prince and the princess only smile when they're holding hands. i accidentally let the prince fall off a cliff and the princess breaks down crying before game over.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The art is simplistic but they have notes for cosplayers :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH NO I KILLED HIM AGAIN AEYUTDUEYRE
Aldus Larian (Jess): That sounds really cute
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~not the killing him part~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I DIDN'T SEE THE MONSTER THERE i should pay more attention to the autosave times
N🆗ri (Marisa): "wow this is a weird part to autosave"
prince dies
"whOOPS"
N🆗ri (Marisa): i keep dying at this part atsytudyyt MY BAD
i think the monsters only come after you in human form and are otherwise just roaming around if you're in human form
i like how the princess adjusts her hair every time she changes from wolf to human
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH NO when you tell the prince to walk to a spot and there's a short fall he kind of trips over it aaaaaa
and sometimes he gets scared so you need to find and pick flowers for him
Aldus Larian (Jess): THATS ADORABLE

Bill: Hopefully they release the fancy box set in English.
Bill: ~~I suppose it doesn’t matter in your case does it, you can play the Japanese version~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): brb goin to japan to play rune factory
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is he okay
N🆗ri (Marisa): if they don't release a physical copy here then i'll see if i can import it because digital store still freaks me out
N🆗ri (Marisa): one small gripe is the japanese and english text sometimes doesn't match up, the english leaves out a lot of little details from their conversations
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahhh always does this right
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg this poor wolf girl
N🆗ri (Marisa): “The things I do for love.”
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo this is a short game, only around 5 hours of playtime so i'll stretch it out
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA good plan
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I read that in the courage voice
