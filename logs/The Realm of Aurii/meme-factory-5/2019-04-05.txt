N🆗ri (Marisa): me anytime i have to take more than 2 steps away from the prince
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no! 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are the puzzles hard?
N🆗ri (Marisa): they weren't until this one i'm on now
the last one was a bit frustrating, you had to count the lanterns in a level but they didn't tell you until the end of the level so there was a lot of backtracking, but still easy
this level was literally "The right path is easy. The bottom path is difficult." The right led directly to the exit, the bottom led me to this insane number puzzle I almost have all the hints for but I keep running into monsters on the last clue
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna do the puzzle but i could skip it and take the easy route any time which is nice :3c
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo that's nice. Looks like a cute game! I'm bad at puzzles
