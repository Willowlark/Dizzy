N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): jESS
N🆗ri (Marisa): NOT IN THAT WAY
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760> are you sure
N🆗ri (Marisa): it an airship see how their hair flow so majestically
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mmhmm likely story
N🆗ri (Marisa): pwease officer
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): in rune factory 2 there were rival weddings and you could propose to a girl at her wedding and she'd just leave her husband at the alter for you
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): and then she just LEAVES
Aldus Larian (Jess): Which was was she supposed to marry? The elf boi?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee now he's all alone on his wedding day rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): FOOL
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow rune factory really likes rib knit fabrics
Aldus Larian (Jess): In dragon age origins one of the origins is you are an elf getting arranged married to some other elf dude from another town and then he dies defending you and your friends from a bunch of royal humans who wanna rape and sell you to the slave trade. He was a good boi. You get to keep your ring for the rest of the game
N🆗ri (Marisa): that so tragic
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): Origins is so good  dragon age is so good. So many good characters
Aldus Larian (Jess): I cry evertiem
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just know everyone love fenris
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA I'm no exception. Oops
Aldus Larian (Jess): I romanced him twice and anders once but anders just like goes more insane throughout the game, there's another dude you can romance too but you can't romance him if you flirt with anyone else even once and I can never resist fenris's first flirt line cuz I'm trash
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg is he like hard more romance level
Aldus Larian (Jess): He's a priest <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): in animal parade you can romance the god who lives on a mountain but you have to climb it every day
N🆗ri (Marisa): turning priests to sin wow
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah he tells you all about how he inly believes in chaste marriage
N🆗ri (Marisa): and then the god doesn't live with you he just gets you pregnant and keeps living on the mountain. the wizard at least will live with you and work the fields if you ask him
Aldus Larian (Jess): But when you flirt with him he says "I have to go pray... Alot" and it's great
N🆗ri (Marisa): GOOD
N🆗ri (Marisa): good dialogue 10/10
N🆗ri (Marisa): 'happy birthday kid see you next year'
N🆗ri (Marisa): priest boy best boy by the sound of it
Aldus Larian (Jess): When you flirt with fenris the first time he giggles and then coughs and gets all awkward it's great
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't remember what anders says he has this whole revolution he's planning and stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): revolution!
N🆗ri (Marisa): viva
Aldus Larian (Jess): There's also Merrill who's a cute niave elf girl and Isabella who's a flirty girl
Aldus Larian (Jess): Isabella tries to guess the color of fenris's undies
N🆗ri (Marisa): *isabella no*
N🆗ri (Marisa): are there love rivals?
Aldus Larian (Jess): No matter who your romance anders will be like "wow I can't believe you picked them over me" while he's literally tricking you into getting together ingredients for him to build a bomb to blow up a church
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow the new mystic messenger sure is something
Aldus Larian (Jess): Which gets really funny when that person is there cuz they're like "wtf bro u think u better than me?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): fight!!! fight! fight!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): fistfight!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh anders also has this spirt he shares a body a with
N🆗ri (Marisa): bro fight
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah no big deal that happens
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea cuz the spurt was possessing another body but the body was dying so anders was like "come-on in bro"
Aldus Larian (Jess): And the spirit makes him all super radical and want justice by any means
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's scary he should go to a doctor and get that checked out
Aldus Larian (Jess): He is a doctor!
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no
Aldus Larian (Jess): He helps poor people who have no money 🙌
Aldus Larian (Jess): Anders starts off good and gets more and more radical and angry. Fenris starts off angry and bitter gets more and more happy
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooo. are you able to marry him? does marrying him like solve all of his problems
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no
Aldus Larian (Jess): No marriage just date
Aldus Larian (Jess): Except priest boy I think you can marry him or at least it's like implied you get married after the game is I've
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dragon age 2 (the game with these characters) is weird cuz the game play sucks and the story is stretched out over tenbyears for like no reason but the characters are coo
N🆗ri (Marisa): at least the characters are good
new harvest moons everything sucks <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
the US company who translated harvest moon stopped licensing the games and just starting making their own awful knock-offs and kept calling them 'harvest moon' so another company stepped up and rebranded the true japanese harvest moon as story of seasons
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone remake dragon age 2 with good story mod
N🆗ri (Marisa): new games look so bad omg
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or just not the same 10 environments recycled 900 times
N🆗ri (Marisa): a wonderful life was the best game they should remake it in HD
N🆗ri (Marisa): except there was a building on the farm that was always locked and you could never open it ever
N🆗ri (Marisa): what was that for. we'll never know.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> what's inside
N🆗ri (Marisa): people online are saying it was supposed to be the horse stable, but programmers decided to put the horse in the barn instead
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg a horse stable would've been so convenient i coulda bought more cows and goats
Aldus Larian (Jess): How could they keep this resource from you
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a rumor that before you die (in the game <:lenny:395307171539189760> it plays out over the course of your whole life) you can open the shed on your last day and there's a picture inside but it's an urban legend i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): I KNOW RIGHT
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it was so easy for the horse to hate you. one day without riding and it wouldn't neigh happily anymore. and there was a scientist who stalked your animals all creepy-like.
N🆗ri (Marisa): he'd just trespass on your farm and stare
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's terrifying
N🆗ri (Marisa): in the later editions of the game reportedly you can expand the chicken coop and that destroys the shed. man. my chickens were always getting lost in the tall grass.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that guy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa chickens
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus Larian (Jess): He's scary!
N🆗ri (Marisa): in the ds version of the game he has a mermaid named leia you can kidnap and marry
N🆗ri (Marisa): he looks just as charming
Aldus Larian (Jess): Save. Her.
N🆗ri (Marisa): HE JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT YOUR COWS FOR NO REASON
and there's a homeless guy who can't speak english and a really ripped artist dude and now that i think about it this game was really weird but *it was great*
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH this guy would sell you a bear and sometimes at the end of cutscenes with your kid the bear would move or look around really sinister for absolutely no reason at all
N🆗ri (Marisa): your wife can divorce you and take the kid too lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Can u marry boi? Can u be gorl?
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a remake yeah!! a few years after the first game came out they released Another Wonderful Life which is the girl version! but all the candidates except for maybe one suck because they didn't make any new bachelors and the original game wasn't made with a female protagonist in mind
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh nooooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know one bachelor is the hippy. it would have been nice to marry the weird artist guy who doesnt do anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): lemme see
N🆗ri (Marisa): you definitely can't marry the scientist luckily
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thank God
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH rock and celia's brother
so you have the hippy, the brother of one of the bachelorettes, and the son of the guys who run the inn. he's lumina's age so he's a kid but in one version you can marry lumina when she's older so i guess it's the same here
N🆗ri (Marisa): marlin's chiseled jaw lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wow... Those are some *great* choices
N🆗ri (Marisa): this guy was only ever in a wonderful life and he didn't even have a purpose so it's really weird. especially since the harvest moon series LOVES to reuse characters
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes there was a yetii also for no reason
Aldus Larian (Jess): U can't marry sculpture man?
N🆗ri (Marisa): no! which is weird because he seems ideal? i think the only point to him being in the game was to be nami's love interest if you didn't marry her, because later in the game she starts talking about him a lot and goes to his house all the time
N🆗ri (Marisa): and if he was nami's love interest then why not make him a bachelor
N🆗ri (Marisa): instead we got
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh boy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): swoon
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea... That's the word I was thinking of
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd prefer the old guy who t poses in the rain
N🆗ri (Marisa): and YOU CAN MARRY THAT GUY IN THE DS VERSION why
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmfao wild
N🆗ri (Marisa): in the ds version you can also marry the dad of one of the bachelorettes oh no gross
N🆗ri (Marisa): were they that hurting for bachelors
according to the wiki they even added a special bachelor. i guess because they added the mermaid as a special bachelorette, the new bachelor is a thief you can only meet by visiting lumina in the middle of the night and witnessing a break-in
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nice. Sign me up
N🆗ri (Marisa): human ganondorf botw design <:thinku:543194478614413318>
