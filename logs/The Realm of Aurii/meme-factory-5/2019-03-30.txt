Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@301927856240459777> , this game never describes what Sekiro means but they call your character it all the time
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Would you have some insight on it's meaning
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Well the old tengu dude calls you that
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Do you have it in context? :0
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Wise elder?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Uhhhhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah a wise elder is telling a younger shinobi
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Calls him him
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ooo
naw sekiro can mean wise elder so maybe not that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And the younger one is also called Ookami a lot
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He serves a young boy who looks like haku
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But he a prince
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): is it his name?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He just names you that all of a sudden so I was wondering if there was a meaning to it
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): he starts calling u sasuke next <:lenny:395307171539189760>
idk sowwy ðŸ˜­
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): dictionaries aren't turning up any results
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): and i haven't heard it before <:rip:369476083248267274>
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): japanese dictionary says maybe i spelled 'sekiro' wrong and meant 'sokoro,' a language spoken in the country of Chad
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): we looked it up
Elfriede Faun (Tom): and jared found that someone said its meant to mean
Elfriede Faun (Tom): one armed wolf?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): idk if you can make any sense of that
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ooo? i can... kind of see that somewhat?
éš» is pronounced seki and used in one-of-a-pair. like, one-arm, one-eye, one-leg. but by itself i don't think it means anything?
and wolf ç‹¼ is certainly pronounced rou when combined with other kanji. so éš»ç‹¼ would be sekirou. but. in that case it'd mean one wolf out of two?
Aldus Larian (Jess): 1 out of 2 wolf's agree, sekiros name be confusing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): woooah
Elfriede Faun (Tom): wierd
Elfriede Faun (Tom): maybe its more like a knickname
Elfriede Faun (Tom): of him mashing everything togethor
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's gotta be
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think the full.context is like
Elfriede Faun (Tom): " oh your the wolf the owl found "
Elfriede Faun (Tom): "I see you have one arm"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I like you
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'll call you sekiro
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): that's it that's how names are named
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): lol
