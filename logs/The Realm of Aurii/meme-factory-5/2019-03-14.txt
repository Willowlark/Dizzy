NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): I trap people in slumber parties every other day so they canâ€™t add other people to their party
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Can you have slumber parties that often?
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Thatâ€™s how it is in my game. I think itâ€™s ether glitched or ive done every single event and thereâ€™s nothing else that can be done so it just constantly gives me slumber parties SO often
But it could also be a glitch. This game is a bit glitchy with events.
