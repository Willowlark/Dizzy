N🆗ri (Marisa): I posted a picture of the weather radar on Twitter this morning and one of my Japanese followers was like “you can understand how intense this weather map is if you’ve played rdr2” <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Bill: So what’s the deal with the Minecraft kick Georgia?
Bill: Marisa was the one who wanted Aurii Minecraft.
N🆗ri (Marisa): aurii minecraft was a communal decision supported by everyone
Bill: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/9/20/16339242/minecraft-cross-platform-update-better-together-windows-10-pc-mobile-switch-xbox helpful. Who owns Minecraft to play it online tho.
Bill: Oh rip has to be PC to connect to a private server.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What platforms does everyone have it for?
Bill: I have PC. Dunno if that carried over into the new version though.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): PC
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and noah wanted to get it to play together but we havent figured out LAN on college internet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): though its also surprisingly the most effective study break activity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its relaxing but still feels productive and creative
Bill: Rather unlikely you’ll be able to use college lan. It’s actuall a WLAN, so you aren’t ACTUALLY on the same network in the backend.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): somehow htheris roommate and his girlfriend play toge
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Minecraft was very relaxing for me in college
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THE MUSIC TOO thats probably part of it
Bill: I suffered much setting up the media center I have now back in college.
Bill: 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The music is amazing. I went through a period where I listened to it to sleep every night ~~because the entire soundtrack is on Spotify~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah ! I have Minecraft on PC too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Bought it so long ago
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I'm the only one with it not on PC lol
Bill: Back in high school lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but if we ever did get a server running I'd get it
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee same
N🆗ri (Marisa): how many people have switches. we should throw town parties when the new animal crossing comes out too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I has Swotch
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have it on Xbox 360 xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom has it on PC idk if I have a copy or not
Bill: Private servers only work off of java edition.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i got java B)
Bill: I do believe I've got hosted all setup.
Bill: 😎
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom has informed me I do not own Minecraft
Bill: Dunno how much I have to pay but it’s on the free tier so not more than Dizzy I guess.
Bill: We’ll see if it has enough memory.
Bill: After dinner I can share the url.
Bill: Have to connect via PC tho.
