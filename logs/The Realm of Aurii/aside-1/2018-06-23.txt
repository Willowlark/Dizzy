Elfriede (Tom) ♍: He just needed a bit of time... to decide what he was going to tell her. Elfriede raised his hand and moved Afina's hair back behind her ear. "Please... give me another day to think it over." He brought his hand down and stroked her shoulder lovingly. 

"You're beautiful Fina... I'd like nothing more than to... continue... tonight, but I need to work through some things first. I'm sorry, please forgive me." He gazed at her, not sure staying the night was the brightest of ideas. It was hard enough to halt himself initiallly, and he still longed for her.
Afina (Georgia🍀): “Oh,” Afina said, the one word response betraying how quickly her mind was moving. _Maybe it’s an Eraian custom. Perhaps he doesn’t know what he’s doing and he’s nervous he’ll mess up. That’s ridiculous, there is no conceivable notion that he’s inept considering what he was doing just a few seconds ago. What could he possibly need to solve in 24 hours_ She almost wanted to be angry at him because she didn’t understand why he was acting this way. The princess tried to shake the thoughts off. She had to trust that Elfriede was genuine about his feelings, and that it was some external force that was holding him back.

“That’s alright,” she said with a small smile. “If you’re not ready then I’m not ready. It would be unwise to force a situation to work when it simply just doesn’t.” She leaned in and kissed him softly on the cheek. “I’m already quite glad to know that my feelings are reciprocated.” 

The Laeran leaned out of the bed to grab Elfriede’s shirt off the floor. “You’re right next door, so if you change your mind, I’ll be here. Otherwise I doubt you’d want the Cardinal to see you looking like _that_,” she laughed lightly, holding out the shirt to him.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede sighed feeling quite inadaquate in the circumstance. Afina's words, although pained, comforted him greatly. He accepted the kiss with a smile and kissed her cheek as well. 
Afina laughed lightly and handed him his shirt. *Have I chosen wrong? should I have just continued?* Questions bombarded his mind. He looked at Afina and couldn't believe how caring she was towards him. He felt his eyes burn as wetness came to them. *I dont want her to see me cry... not tonight... I need to go* "He walked over to the door holding his shirt limply at his side. 

"Thank you for understanding Afina... I... Have a good night sleep. I look forward to see you in the morning." He flashed his disarming smile and shut her door.

Faun slowly paced back to his room, tears building up at the edges of his eyes. *I... cannot be sure but...* He thought of Afina's face, kissing her, touching her body, how sweet she to him was despite his withdrawel. Tear's finally spilled over a bit and ran down his cheeks. *I think I love her..*

Afina (Georgia🍀): “Goodnight, sleep well, Elfriede,” Afina said, smiling back at him. The princess hated to watch Elfriede depart after such an emotional exchange, but something was clearly agitating him. It was best to leave him to figure out things himself. The princess burrowed under the covers, rolling over onto her side to stare at the white candle on the side table that casted its flickering light across the room. 

_Where does Elfriede fit into your plans for the future, Afina?_ she asked herself, brows furrowed in thought. She had set out from Theanovene in search of knowledge that would qualify her to be queen of Laera. Now… she wasn’t so sure. She still wanted to provide for her nation, but such a goal also conflicted with her desire to be by Elfriede’s side. And now his strange behavior? That complicated her plans for the future even more so. The princess exhaled. She hoped that Elfriede would come to terms with whatever was ailing him soon enough. If she could figure things out with Elfriede, then she might be able to figure out what her goals were once they departed Trisp. 

_Elfriede..._ The princess’ hand came to her lips as she thought of their exchange. It was just yesterday that they had hesitantly shared a common space, and now. _Kissing_, Afina thought, pulling the covers up to her nose as a pink tint blossomed across her cheeks. _Please think it over quickly, Elfriede. I don’t want to spend any more time apart._
