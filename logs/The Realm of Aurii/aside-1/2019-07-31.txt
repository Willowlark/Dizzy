Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Chengu smirked playfully at her as they waltzed their way around the ballroom floor. "Well then, it truly *is* an honor to have been selected. Thank you m'lady. And yes, you are correct. This is my first time in this this kingdom. I have yet to see much of it unfortunately, but if this castle is enough to speak for the grandeur of the kingdom, then I must say, it is rather beautiful."
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “I would be inclined to agree. Laera is truly exquisite in what it has to offer. I recommend you visit, at least, the library before you depart; The architecture is marvelous and I’m confident that we have literature on any subject your heart may desire. Should you know a member of the royal council—.” Afina paused to raise her eyebrows for emphasis. “The librarians may be so inclined to let you take a novel home with you.” 

Afina beamed up at the stranger, excited to be speaking of her homeland again. “Ah, and where night home be for you, kind sir?”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): [END ASIDE ~~because Kieron’s a dickhead~~]
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~kind of ok. Chengu was nervous sneering that question~~
