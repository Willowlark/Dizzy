Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Realizing how tense she was, Afina let herself relax and laughed lightly. “An interesting notion, kind stranger. But nothing of the sort. It would simply be in poor taste for the princess of Laera not to observe one of our highest traditions.” The princess looked over her dancing partner more thoroughly now that there was no sense of urgency. Unmistakably Kissaelain ears poked through the gentleman’s red hair. He was firmly built, yet lean. Yet clever and comfortable enough to have quipped back at her. _Well-nourished and intelligent, he must be a noble’s son_, Afina thought.

“Forgive me, as I may have sounded assumptive in asking you to dance. But tell me, was I correct in assuming you are not a local? It would seem that I know the whole kingdom at this point, and I don’t quite recall your face.”
