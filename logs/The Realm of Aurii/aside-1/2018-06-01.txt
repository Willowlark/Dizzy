Eliran (Halim): ```CHaracters: Afina, Desii, Eliran
Location: Outside the Abbey```
Eliran (Halim): Eliran was peacefully waiting when he hears a very rude voice interject and ram into him out of nowhere. Not one to take such things lying down, he quickly grabbed the rude maidens shoulder, "Pardon Miss," He started, before noticing the girl was a mage, clearly ready to fight. _Jesus christ why is it all female mages want to shoot me with something these days_ He thought to himself, as he quickly grabbed the girls free hand, pointing it very specifically not in his direction, and promptly knocked her tome hand out of the way with his other hand. "Woh there miss why the sudden need to fi- wait a minute..." He bent over slightly to look her in the eye, "My god is this an Afrin of the Tyndalls I spy?" He asked incredulously, "What are _you_ doing here?"  the surprise was clear in his voice.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina yelped as her free hand was grabbed by the wrist, and her other promptly dropped her tomes. “Hey, what are you--” the princess started, before she found herself eye to eye with a certain charismatic merchant from her childhood. A confused look flickered across her face, before lighting up as she realized who it was that she had bumped into. “Eliran!?” she exclaimed incredulously, throwing her arms around the tall man. She pressed her cheek to his chest and closed her eyes, much like she had done as a child. “Eliran, what are you doing here? What brought you to Trisp? Are you well? What have you been doing,-- I mean, why didn’t you write-- I was just in Theanovene and no one there had heard from you in quite some time and--.” Afina exhaled, separating herself from Eliran and resting her hands on his upper arms. “I’m so glad to see you, how _are_ you?”
Eliran (Halim): As a man brought into a sudden hug, he only knew one thing to do, kindly reciprocate. After exchanging the customary cheek pecks, Eliran waited out Afina's sudden barrage of questions, knowing that once she got going there was no possibility of getting a word in edgewise. Eliran smiled at her reaction, giving a slight chuckle, "I'm doing fine as you can see," he said with a grin, "Though some people might have me broiled via light magic in front of the house of god." He added with mock reproach. "I

After exchanging the customary cheek pecks, Eliran waited out Afina's sudden barrage of questions, knowing that once she got going there was no possibility of getting a word in edgewise. Eliran smiled at her reaction, giving a slight chuckle, "I'm doing fine as you can see," he said with a grin, "Though some people might have me broiled via light magic in front of the house of god." He added with mock reproach. "I'm in Eraia for an archery tournament, and Trisp specifically because I have mail for a Bishop named Dean and the friends I met along the way needed to visit." He exclaimed, perfectly glossing over his lack of writing back, "enough about me though, how are you? You certainly seem to have grown up a little since the last I saw you," he said looking her down, "I daresay you've even put on a bit of muscle since the last time. What happened to being a bookworm?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Excited to be seeing such a positive reminder of home (and more importantly, a friend), Afina let most of Eliran’s teasing slide. The princess stood straighter as the Eblian inquired about her welfare, resting her fists on her hips. “I’ve been travelling for weeks from Tyndall Tower in Theanovene. I’m here for a cultural exchange that Master Witella-- you remember him-- was able to garner for me. While I’m quite proficient in light magic-- as you may also remember-- I’m finding this a valuable opportunity to expand upon that which I already know.” Afina raised her chin higher. “In fact, I’ve also taken up sword fighting since you’ve last seen me. My--”

The princess hesitated, realizing that Elfriede was probably still wandering the market, waiting for her to turn. “My… uh… my escort Elfriede actually taught me. He was the one sent from Eraia to bring me here. He actually… might still be waiting for me to return. I had only run back to the monastery because it seems I’ve misplaced that pin that father gave me so long ago.” She laughed nervously. “But you should come to meet his acquaintance, I’m sure you would love him!”
Eliran (Halim): "You've taken up _sword_ fighting?" Eliran whistled, "you've definitely been busy." _An Eraian escort? I bet he's a Lylalel praising zealot_ he thought to himself, _at least he got her here safe._ "I can't wait to meet him." He said with a smile, "I'll definitely join you, if your staying here do you know the Bishop? The sooner I deliver this the better. My companions aren't used to Eraia, so I can't help but think they might end up breaching some form of courtesy and cause problems in town" _Especially Nokri, If anything goes wrong they could kill her for being a spy_.
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Yes of course," Afina said. "I'll take the letter to the Bishop for you while I grab my brooch. You two can wait right out here," she said, holding her palm open to receive the letter. _I wonder if Eliran trusts me enough to do so_, she thought.
Eliran (Halim): Eliran gave a sad smile, "Sorry princess, no can do. Mail goes to the recipient directly. Even if I know you well its the rules." he shrugged, "You could always just show me to the bishop instead?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina squinted at Eliran and turned around with a grumble. "Yes, of course, I'll show you inside. But when we're finished we must be getting back to the market!"
Eliran (Halim): ```End Aside```
