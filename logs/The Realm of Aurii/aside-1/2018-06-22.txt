Eliran (Halim): "Probably for the best, if I stayed who knows what the others would think" Eliran mused. He shook is head at the thought, then paused. He was unsure if he still wanted to mention Enera, the night was approaching swiftly and discussing the potential of a church kidnapping was not necessarily something he wanted to do with the potential ears nearby. 
"Afina... about the girl you mentioned at dinnee." He thought again, remembering the Eraian knight next door. _I definitely can't trust his view on this_ Eliran thought, thinking of the Knights knee gut reaction to Nokri and his pre-existing suspicion of their company. "Ah never mind, we need to talk but it can wait for tomorrow." He ruffled her hair one last time as he stood up, "now I'll let you get some alone time with your knight boy" he added teasingly. "Dont break your bed, monastery mattresses arent known for their durability."
Afina (Georgia🍀): "I-- what!? You little dumb--" Afina grabbed a hold of her pillow and shoved it in Eliran's face in an attempt to smother him. "Don't make such suggestions, we are in a holy building right now!"
Eliran (Halim): Eliran, who was already standing and if her bed, easily caught and held afinas pillow away from his face as she tried to smother him in vain. "Okay okay," he conceded laughing.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina lowered her makeshift weapon in defeat. "Yes, indeed. I'll see you tomorrow, Eliran. Goodnight," she said, giving him one last hug for the night. She felt like she should say some other well-wishing words, but a "goodnight" would suffice for then.
Eliran (Halim): Eliran returned the hug with a tight squeeze, and then before letting her go have Afina a light kiss on the forehead, emulating the Laeran tradition. "Sleep well Afrin." He added before heading out the door and homeword.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina plopped back down on the bed as he departed, a light creak squeaking from the mattress as she did so. _Well, it seems he's the same old Eliran,_ she thought.
Afina (Georgia🍀): [END ASIDE]
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ```Elfriede Faun, Afina Tyndall
Afina’s Temporary bedroom, Trisp```

Faun paced back and forth in his room a bit thinking about how much of a fool he made of himself today. He needed to apologize to several people including the princess. *Plus she wanted to talk tonight...” 

“But, my actions weerent without merit… I mean she was clearly…”
It didn’t matter and he knew it. He exited his room heading over to Afina’s but stopped in his tracks when he heard a male voice. *That man from earlier.* He felt a heavy tug on his heart, Elfriede wanted nothing more than to respect her privacy but…*something* drove him forwards.

“--robably for the best, if i stayed who knows what the others would think.” Elfriede abruptly stopped again. After a brief moment he returned to his room, not wanted to hear anymore and jumble his thoughts. After a few minutes he heard footsteps passed his door heading for the exit. He waited a few minutes which felt like forever just in case and exited his room yet again. He *needed* to talk to her, for many reasons, some he didn’t fully understand.

Faun got to the doorway and gently knocked on its trim not looking in right away, as was the honorable thing to do. “...Fina? ...You wanted to see me tonight?” He felt a slight tremble in his voice. “I have some things I wanted to talk about as well.” *His mind drifting against his will to the handsome bard.*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina's heart sank as she heard Elfriede on the other side of her door. _Right, there were things we said that we would discuss when we got to Trisp_, she remembered, holding her pillow tighter. "Come in!" the princess beckoned, more tense than she had been earlier. "Don't think I forgot, of course. But what was it you were hoping to talk about first?" Afina fidgeted as she sat on the bed, realizing that sitting cross legged was not entirely comfortable. She shifted to tuck her legs underneath her. _Perhaps it's the nerves more than anything_, she thought.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede entered and eyed the princess in her nightgown. He sighed a tiny bit and walked over to the bed grabbing its frame at the end and glancing down. “First… I want to apologize to you for causing a scene earlier… it is just the Drecan girl… I’m sorry.. No excuses for my behavior.” He bowed slightly to her.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina blinked in surprise, fully anticipating another topic. "Oh. Well your apology is greatly appreciated and accepted. I understand that your nations are at war; if it were myself I would have done the same thing. Prejudice is a form of ignorance, which all Laerans try to avoid, but. Sometimes it happens anyways. All that really matters is that the situation has been resolved. The Drecan girl doesn't seem to hold it against you." _Though whether or not a free meal may have played an integral role in smoothing tensions is still to be debated_, Afina thought.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede nodded a bit and moved to sit down next to Afina on the bed. And paused a bit before the selfish topic he was about to dig into.  "So... How... Aquanted are you with the Bard? You have not really said anything about your relationship with him." He said to her with both a hint of curiousity and a touch of something more selfish.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina wanted to laugh. This conversation was much lighter than that she had been anticipating. "Eliran? We were friends in our youth. His grandfather was well acquainted with mine; Consequently, we were introduced to each other at a young age. My family also helped to train him in the ways of noble etiquette. Is... there a reason you're asking?" Afina inquired with a puzzled expression.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: "N-No I was just curious is all.. " Elfriede awkward ly fidgeted in place. "I..". 
A few brief moments passed and he move his hand to hers. 

"We.. wanted to discuss something?" He finally got out, his chest tightening a bit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _Oh, there's the topic I was bracing for,_ Afina thought as Elfriede reached his hand out for hers. She laced her fingers with his, hoping her hold didn't betray her nervous state. Afina's heart beat hard in her chest; She couldn't remember that last time she felt so nervous, if she could even think at all. Her thoughts were scattered, and the princess grasped for the first one that she could find. "When we were in the woods outside Trisp. You said that you wanted to be selfish. What did you mean?" Afina kept her gaze down, purposely avoiding eye contact with Elfriede. She was already experiencing difficulty in focus; His disarming and thoughtful gaze would make speaking her mind that much more difficult.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Faun squeezed her hand a bit unknowingly when he heard her question. They sat there as a few moments passed while he gathered his thoughts. He thought briefly that they probably looked amusing, both if them staring at the floor unable to raise there gaze at each other. He had to though... If he was to explain himself properly. 

He slowly raised his head and turned it towards her. "...I wanted to be close to you."
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina felt a light squeeze from Elfriede's hand, and she shifted her gaze from the floor to their hands. She knew what she wanted to ask, but just couldn't find it in herself to put such a question into words. _If I were Eliran, this would be so much easier_, she thought, cursing the bard in her mind. The princess felt Elfriede's gaze trying to meet hers, but she couldn't muster up the courage to do so herself. She shifted in her seat again, mulling over the thousands of questions she could ask the knight next. "Is that... something you still want now?"
Bill: ~~and then they fucked. Graphically~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede a free hand found it's way to her cheek and lightly turned her head toward his. His heart beating hard in his chest. 

"I... Would think so..." he finally got out as he stared into her blue orbs, which were sparkling a bit in the reflected candle light.
Bill: ~~Then they fucked again~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina could feel her blood run cold with adrenaline as Elfriede turned her face towards his, and she found herself immersed in his amber stare. It was like someone had turned off her mind, and the princess could scarcely form words. She didn’t have time to think anymore, she could only speak from the heart. In a way, Afina was terrified. Everything she did, she analyzed and thought about, it was just the Laeran way. But now was the best time as any to be honest. What had she told Eliran after all? _There's someone I'm interested in, and I have reason to suspect he is as well,_ echoed in her mind. 

“I don’t want you to leave when our time in Trisp is concluded. There’s still so much I want to experience, I don’t feel like I’ve had enough time with you.” 

Part of Afina wanted to run and hide for saying things so blatantly, honestly. The other part, however… was content to be exactly where she was.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: The honesty that the two shared was freeing. Elfriede felt both releoved and terrified for the future. He didn't know how to talk to her in this manner. He didn't know how to bring up his heritage or when. He didn't know how long they would be able to remain together.

Even so Elfriede's face went flush as he leaned forward and embraced her. He held her for a few moments before slowly retreat in to looking her in the eyes again. 

"I don't know what this means for us in the future, and... quite honestly I'm afraid.. Fina.. I've never..." He paused, the words briefly caught. "...felt like this." 

He couldn't tell if he was being foolish, or was blinded by his foolishness, but he wanted to put aside everything in his life to have her.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _Elfriede_ did _feel the same way_, Afina thought as the two embraced. In that moment, it was as if all the anxiety had melted away as she held the knight closely. Afina felt secure in knowing that her feelings were reciprocated, that Elfriede had like been thinking the same things that she had been recently. “We can never know what the future may bring. But… at least now… we might be assured knowing that at least we’ll have each other.”

The princess once again held Elfriede’s hand in her own, shyly looking away. “I’ve never had a better time than these past few weeks I’ve spent. Falling for you,” Afina said, hesitating on the last phrase, the words feeling odd coming from her. But in a way, it also felt right. Should anything happen to them, she would at least be able to rest assured that her feelings were reciprocated.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Hearing her words caused his heart to start racing, beating unbelievably hard in his chest. “Fina… I just…” His body forced him forwards. 

He looked at her in a different light now. He noticed the way her hair fell on her shoulders, her eyes, her slightly parted lips looking as if they wanted to say something more to him. He stared at them for a second, his body forcing him forward until he felt them against his as he pressed into her. A soft warm sensation flowed through his mind and body and he embraced her. He held himself there against her for… he didn’t know how long.. Until they finally separated his face slowly backing away from hers. Princess Tyndall and Knight Lieutenant Faun looking into eachothers eyes once again.
Bill: Ransford Gale knocks down the door to the room.

"ABOUT FUCKING TIME YA PUSSSSSYYYYYY!" 

He then attempts to replace the door while smoking a cigar.
Afina (Georgia🍀): In an instant, Afina felt Elfriede’s lips on hers and it was like a thousand sensations were bombarding the princess’ senses. She could feel Elfriede’s face, warm against her own. Her hands, caught between the two of them, grasped the soft fabric of his nightshirt. Her very being felt warmed by the kiss, incomparable to any sensation she had felt before.

The two parted, and Afina realized that she still held onto Elfriede’s shirt tightly. She laughed as she let go, lighthearted and giddy from the kiss. “Who would have thought that the upstanding Eraian knight would be caught with a Callorian princess,” Afina said with a sly smile, her face still inches from his own. She wasn’t sure how _done_ they were (_Nobles traditionally weren’t particularly affection to begin with,_ Afina thought), but it was clear something more had to be said for their actions.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: His smiled at her and they sat still for a few moments, senses overwhelmed by the kiss. His heart still forcing him ever onward, while his mind screamed for him to stop. Elfriede could hardly believe his actions. Before he knew it he gently was laying the princess back and interlocking lips with her again as she laid down. He backed away a bit hanging over her prone form. 

He smirked playfully, unable to relieve himself of his joking-competitive nature even in the moment... “Somewhat reminds me of our sparring match back at Ransfords camp... for you are pinned again Miss Tyndall.”
Afina (Georgia🍀): “And you may very well underestimate me, Sir Faun,” she said, reaching up to unbutton his shirt. At any other time, the princess might have hesitated to admire the smooth purple fabric, but at the moment it was nothing more than a barrier. Afina threw the garment to the side, not entirely concerned with keeping track of it. “Perhaps pinned beneath my knight is exactly where I want to be.” 

Afina pulled Elfriede back towards her once more, her hands running through his caramel colored hair. She had never been so close to someone before, physically nor emotionally, but in a way, everything she did with Elfriede felt right. The princess separated from him suddenly, breathless. “Did… you want to…?” she asked hesitantly, nodding downwards.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede smirked genuinely at the princess's retort. He allowed her quickly unbotton his top and throw it aside, causing adrenline to run through his veins, his face feeling tingly and his breathing escalated. The came togethor again kissing passionatly as she grabbed his hair in fistfulls. When they separated she looked at him and asked the question he had been asking himself for the passed few minutes. Upon hearing her confirmation he leaned back in slowly and kissed her neck, running one hand up the outside of her thigh. Faun's mind screaming at him **no**, this will only end in disaster. *She HAS to know first.*

For a moment he ignored his logic. His hand kept rising under her gown and over her hip gently passing over her waistband of her undergarments and up to her bare waist. Faun felt his whole body was heating up, he wanted nothing but her.  

*but...* suddenly Elfriede froze and backed off removing his hand and backing away from her neck. *He couldn't... He had to explain to her proper... and not now, that would be wrong.*  He looked up at Afina defeated, hair a mess, and sulking a bit. "Perhaps.. we should wait."
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina herself was enraptured in the ecstasy of the moment, not entirely sure what she was doing, but well assured that it was pleasurable. She felt Elfriede all over; his body pressed against hers, his lips grazed her neck, his hand stroked her thigh. The princess suddenly realized that she might have to explain the scar on her torso, but quickly dismissed such a thought, far too enthralled with being in such intimate proximity with Elfriede.

And then, he stopped. Elfriede backed away, and Afina cocked her head in confusion. She quickly sat up straight. _Something must be wrong,_ she thought, worriedly. Perhaps his own previous injuries had been upset. Afina looked Elfriede up and down quickly; At first glance, nothing seemed wrong. There was a certain defeated posture about him, like he had just been admonished. _Was it something I did?_ she wondered, confused though mostly worried about such an abrupt change in attitude. And then came the fateful words, _perhaps we should wait_.

Afina nodded slowly as she processed what Elfriede said. _Wait? Wait for what? We very well may be separated once Elfriede must return back to the military, isn’t there a sense of urgency about this?_ she thought. “Yes… yes, this is true. You make a fair statement,” she said, running a hand through her hair and exhaling. “Nothing good comes from rushed intimacy.” The Laeran quickly pulled her nightgown back over her legs. “Did you… want to just. Stay the night. Without that?” Afina asked hesitantly, as if they were reaching a compromise that she wasn’t exactly keen on.
