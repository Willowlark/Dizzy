Nokri (Marisa): "Pardon?" Nokri took offense to his words and it greatly showed. "Did you call me a Drecan? I don't appreciate being vilified in such a way." Aldus's audible confusion was a nice bonus. She had no clue why he was confused, but it would help sell the act.

"We've already agreed to go with you, haven't we sir? We wish to avoid unnecessary trouble as much as you but we would prefer to keep things civil and *not* spew insults at one another. If you can promise us that, we shall follow."
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Elfriede scrunched up his nose a bit at her comment. "Fine." He conceded. He had his mind made up that she was Drecan, but now he was second guessing himself. Was all this drama for nothing? Maybe she was some odd mix of Eraia and Laeran having blonde hair which was not so common in Eraia. 
..but her eyes and her tan skin... Elfriede sighed. "I can indeed promise you that. Let's be on our way." Faun wanted this whole situation resolved already, these two were already giving him a headache that he did not need.
Eliran (Halim): As Eliran walked into the market area with Afina, he could hear a familiar offended tone, "Pardon?" Was all he needed to know who was in trouble. He sighed to himself, _Well good thing I have my, our,  papers_ And walked over to the sound, and upon seeing Elfriede and and his two copatriots, immediately went to work. 
"Nokri, Aldus, How are you guys holding up?" He started with a smile, arms spread in greeting, Eliran quickly passed Elfriede and stood in between the knight and his friends. "Get everything we need for tonight?" Eliran asked Aldus, before looking towards Elfriede, acting as if he just noticed the knight, "May Lylalels guidance be with you," he said with a slight bow, then as if noticing Elfriede disposition he asked, "I'm sorry is something the matter?" Eliran asked sounding genuinely concerned, still standing between the two.
