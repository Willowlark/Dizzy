Nokri (Marisa): that's supposed to be a gif hmm
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): DAYUM
Nokri (Marisa): but yeah totally yaoi <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I'm confused still.
Bill: ~~I'll take lewd and dark tho, am I supposed to go watch this~~
Nokri (Marisa): yes go watch it
Nokri (Marisa): idk what's happening with ranmao during the alice in wonderland episode though that's still a mystery
Aldus (Jess): does the kid get les whinny?
Aldus (Jess): hows the dub? i need things to watch while i work out so i cant read subtitles (or at least i prefer not to cuz i lose track of whats going on)
Nokri (Marisa): ciel? hmm. it's been a looooong time since i've seen the first season but he does get more mature. he puts up with enough nonsense that he gets used to it and only objects in the most ridiculous cases.

except one arc where he literally reverts back to a scared child and all he does is whine but that's deep in the manga and has good cause.

i think the dub is pretty popular. i've never seen it but a lot of US fans watched the dub
Nokri (Marisa): in season 2 it's alois that's kind of whiny but alois is insane. season II doesn't exist in the manga it's an entire anime-only plot that ends the series.

since season 1 is so old you could try watching some of the newer series, like Book of Circus which is 12 episodes
Aldus (Jess): üòÆ
Nokri (Marisa): how kuroshitsuji does fanservice:

girls are nude with huge chests, very little censoring. girl is likely being used for a bigger, much darker purpose. ~~or ranmao who just strips and hugs other girls for no reason~~ probably gonna wind up dead.

guys are for comedy
