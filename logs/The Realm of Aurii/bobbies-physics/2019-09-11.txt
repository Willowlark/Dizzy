Nokri (Marisa): i hope i win this round
Nokri (Marisa): NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Your was funnier
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Wat
El氣電e Faun (Tom): some people only pick the card that makes the most sense
Nokri (Marisa): ;A;
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yea, fun ruiners
Nokri (Marisa): my cards glitched and i was sad but everything got better because
El氣電e Faun (Tom): whos smeargle
El氣電e Faun (Tom): besides a pokemon
Nokri (Marisa): good question :0
it's a bot that makes haiku, and also is a part of team rocket which i think all the bots in the server are because there's a channel dedicated to pokemon bots
Nokri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wanna play CAH online 沽ｮ
Nokri (Marisa): Aurii cah when
Nokri (Marisa): this was such a hard decision how did they all get good cards
El氣電e Faun (Tom): those are some good card
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Yeahh that's not a good practice to get into, granted I wouldn't take it as far as them, as the child anime characters (13-16) are drawn exactly the same at 18-20s and sometimes even adults most of the time
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Like the fact that Misty was... What 11? 12?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah basically
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Like aging up the girl that seshomaru travels with and drawing them having sex is something she's done and that character is drawn as a literal child (like 6 or 7)
El氣電e Faun (Tom): That might be a bit too far yeah
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Them
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea sakimis a little.... questionable
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Like seshomaru and Rina are fucking adorable but not in a romantic way
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Cuz she's ya know, 7
Nokri (Marisa): *and the kimono is wrong in the nezuko drawing* that doesn窶冲 bother me as much as her being a minor but it窶冱 still bothersome
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but if she's a demon, isn't she technically not alive? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): They did kill other demons <:thinku:543194478614413318> I think it窶冱 a species transfer rather than being dead?
Aldus Larian (Jess): it like this in the show
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH!! Sakimi got it backwards even with source material
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): fake fan
Aldus Larian (Jess): other demon are on the alive side too
Nokri (Marisa): Nora also has it correct but she窶冱 dead
El氣電e Faun (Tom): SPIDER BOI
El氣電e Faun (Tom): The kimonos have such meet designs in the show
