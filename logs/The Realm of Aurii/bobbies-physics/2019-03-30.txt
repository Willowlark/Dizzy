Bill: There’s alternate with her in white lingerie.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Alternative physics"
Bill: *flying I guess*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I mean flying makes sense because of her quirk
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The rest
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 🤔
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Her left leg looks like it's going through him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Shes mirio now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ok but her hair... can we go back to her hair for a sec
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): What happened there
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): We can clearly see her regular bob
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But then
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...... random long ass strands of hair
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Coming from the back of her neck?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like a rat tail thing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yes a RAT TAIL
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THANK YOU YES
Aldus Larian (Jess): But untied
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *she almost has Zen's haircut*
Bill: I think it’s like a ponytail? She had a ponytail in the solo print I think.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yikes

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And bright pink sneakers
Bill: Wedding lingerie, but the same black gym tank top.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And her cuffs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): TOTALLY NEED BUBBLE CUFFS WITH LINGERIE
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So hot
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Wow
Bill: That’s the next boudoir shoot. “Sakimi designed my outfit boudoir”
Aldus Larian (Jess): This outfit makes 0 sense
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh so sonic boudoir
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ironic boudoir
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: *I’m all for admiring the female form Sakimi but stuff getting more and more hit or miss.*

Bill: *hawt*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Steal her look*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YASS
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): This is a huge improvement over the last art
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Omg lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): You forgot the rat tail
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Which is honestly the most striking part of the Look™
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: I’m so glad you put the effort in to find these things.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The movie ended and I got bored
Bill: ~~is it weird the more time passes the more okay with the look I am~~
Bill: Same artist as the Bumblebee I posted to BNE. Rare to see Pyrrha.
N🆗ri (Marisa): isn't pyrrha the most commonly lewded rwby tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): why everyone got the same outfit
Bill: Is... she?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye she was like the most common lewd character. probably declined after her death but while she lived she was highly lewded
Bill: ~~and you know this howwww~~
Bill: You need to get that lewd filter checked. 😛
N🆗ri (Marisa): THE TAGS
people not tagging their nsfw
unless pyrrha was just the only nsfw they didn't tag and they managed to hide nearly every other character
Bill: I’ve never checked the boorus explicitly but I feel like Yang gets most lewding.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah. i feel like it's pyrrha>yang>weiss oddly enough
N🆗ri (Marisa): nop u right, danbooru has twice the yang than pyrrha. idk how much of that is lewd but it's a lot more
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe people just can't tag their lewd pyrrha properly
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk if beedoir is ever happening but
Bill: Yeaaaah this dish series is great.
Bill: Also yeah Weiss gets a lot.
Bill: ~~are you allowed on danbooru young lady~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you only spend .05 seconds per page u can't see the lewd
Bill: 20 bucks says your computer can’t load the page that fast. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i close about 30 of my open tabs maybe
Aldus Larian (Jess): The only thing I can see on the Pyrrha art is that her belly button is way to high
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nora is rare it seems
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg can't unsee bellybutton height now
N🆗ri (Marisa): why is it so high up
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't know <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's like right in the middle of her abdomen
Aldus Larian (Jess): It caught me eye right away and now I'm just like 😶
N🆗ri (Marisa): don't you mean 😮 because the bottom dot is how high her bellybutton is
Aldus Larian (Jess): It should be under the Lacy part
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/03/29/share-americans-not/
Bill: Do your part for America and fuck!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): British adults averaged 54 fucks per year I think
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which considering some people are at 0, someone’s doin the good work to drive up the average 😂
Bill: Hai hai.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That's so many fucks
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damnnnn
Elfriede Faun (Tom): "The lack of no sex is driven by mainly the young"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Tbh I'm not surprised
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You can't just go, hey let's get married and buy a house
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Willy nilly anymore
Bill: Can still fuck tho?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): People are totes gonna be less likely to fucc at parents house too tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): Millennials on average are also extremely stressed out too alot don't have time or energy to seak out sexual partners when they are working a ton of hours to pay too-high rent
Aldus Larian (Jess): Some reasons listed in the video include the fact that porn is easy to access, (alot easier than finding a partner) increased anit-depressent use ( anti depressents decrease sex drive) and being turned off by hook up culture.
N🆗ri (Marisa): also it's super lewd and gross
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahh all that sounds right
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: If anti depressants reduce sex drive, and sexing satisfies sex drive, by the logic sex is the worlds first anti depressant.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sex is in theory an anti-depressent cuz it floods your mind with seratonin.
Bill: Rip.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's also why depressed people may tend to masterbate alot
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg that's not true is it
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's so gross
N🆗ri (Marisa): why humanity gotta be so freaky
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sorry ma girl but ye. It makes the feel good chemicals so people can use it as a means to feel better for a little bit
N🆗ri (Marisa): have those people ever pet a cat before. probably much better.
Bill: The more you don’t want to know...!
Aldus Larian (Jess): S C I E C N E
Bill: Time for to belt out a chorus of “can anybody find me someone to love” and cry into a var of ice cream.
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe the feet doctor has your picture because of reasons
Aldus Larian (Jess): A cat will love you! Sometimes.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Depends on the cat
Bill: *Im not a furry*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): A dog will
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): doggos always love
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ive never met a tsundere dog
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~except my ex girlfriend~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): BSHSJJDBDBD
Aldus Larian (Jess): My cousins good did not give a shit
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh did you mean *love*?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think my cat loves me she follows me everywhere i go in the house
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes she baps me in the face to wake up and play
N🆗ri (Marisa): cats are great
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh your cat def loves you
Bill: I got that big friend love energy. I’m decidedly lacking in the romantic, Netflix and chill, reciprocated feelings department. And the you know. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and the owning a pet department right
Aldus Larian (Jess): Biru is looking for someone to *love"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://giphy.com/gifs/man-rock-queen-EaUqFB34gfKRG
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~bonus points for that being freddie mercury~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~negative points for the gif being SO FAST~~
Bill: Sigh.
Bill: * *to love who reciprocated the damned feelings cause I’m really going to die if I have to do unrequited for a third fucking run*
N🆗ri (Marisa): confess to lots of girls and do a harem run
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ✨ theres someone out there for everyone ✨
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you already do computer stuff, become IRL 707 and all the ladies will FLOCK
N🆗ri (Marisa): noo that would mean he has to erase all traces of his existence, work 24/7, and alienate himself from everyone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _but the bitches_
Aldus Larian (Jess): It also would mean he's alienate himself and push away anyone that seemed interested for days on end which would never work irl
Bill: *change entire personality to get women*
Bill: No thank.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it was a solution, not a *good* one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think the trick to getting a girlfriend/boyfriend is to not actively seek it out and dwell on that you dont have one. You gotta just learn to appreciate yourself and your own company. And work on getting better at social interaction and with time it just builds up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): also all the girls would be like 14 by majority based on toms experienes at zenkai lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Also yikes LOL
N🆗ri (Marisa): don't be a sean and you'll be fine
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah leanna is riiiight
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i stumbled on both hal and noah
Bill: Riiight this getting annoyingly real and I don’t need heartache to go with the headache. Thanks but moving on.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): sorry
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): we're your friends so we want to help but
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah i dont think we are
Bill: No need to apologize. You are doing the advice. It’s just not a problem I want to dwell on at the moment. Rather than be stuck inside and depressed I’ll keep it to just stuck inside.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~You brought it up fam~~
Bill: I did!
Bill: Yes!
Bill: Which is why I’m saying there’s no fault to be had in the supportive things Georgia and Leanna were saying and I’m not mad, I’d just rather not work through an ~~impossible~~ difficult issue while sick in bed because it’s going make me feel sad on top of sick!
Aldus Larian (Jess): I understand
Bill: https://www.instagram.com/p/BvpICo7AkAp/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
Bill: Bride 2Butt.
N🆗ri (Marisa): properly placed bellybutton
Bill: Lol
