Bill: Nope.
Aldus (Jess): like his rope skills are good? i guess i dont know much about that but he cant pose his models in very flattering ways
Bill: Mm, going to end up a lot like boudoir. Surprisingly detailed posing.
Bill: He’s like, third party guy you bring in for rope shit. Photography seems to be his dabbling.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just looks uncomfy
Afina (Georgia🍀): Not even sexy uncomfy
Aldus (Jess): his wife must be damn confident  in her relationship
Bill: Can’t say.
Aldus (Jess): well yea lol
Bill: I think he’s just more into the rope work than photos. Photography is a means to an end.
Aldus (Jess): yea i originally thought he was a photographer too but that seems to be more of a side thing
Bill: Ye. Do not recommend.
Aldus (Jess): i was considering it
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think I would feel weird indulging other people's kinks
Dizzy: I'm not counting those right now.
Bill: !counter jess’s-kinks add 1
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like that's like someone standing on a street with a sign saying "choke me for free"
Aldus (Jess): BILLY I WAS BEING SARCASTIC DAMN IT
Bill: Given Finn was involved? People who sign on for that are doing it to get content catering to that kink I think. Why half ass/ learn it yourself when you can get someone whose good at it, get good content, and fill your patreon?
Elfriede (Tom): yeeee
Bill: It’s business.
Elfriede (Tom): Finn's top photo in google is bible black, oof
Aldus (Jess): well that was a fun trip
Bill: Welcome to the wonderful world of kinks.
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~so that is a plus one then~~
Aldus (Jess): im sorry, what?
Bill: To the counter.
Aldus (Jess): jdslkgthnbkixszrejbuvnoixlvhr\
Aldus (Jess): y u do this to me
Bill: Because you react amusingly?
Aldus (Jess): DAS RUDE
Bill: Also probably something gay like you’re my closest female friend and if you got kinks with my other best friend I support you because I love your relationship.
Bill: But mostly go with that first one.
Bill: He got a hand raise gif and a “so excited” in the comments.
Aldus (Jess): mr rope?
Bill: Ye
Elfriede (Tom): it sounds liked you are talking about the rope itself in like a kinky way lmao <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): "Mr rope?
Aldus (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina (Georgia🍀): MR ROPE
Afina (Georgia🍀): if anyone used that language in the bedroom I would leave
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Here comes mr rope" like no I'm bolting
Elfriede (Tom): OMG
Elfriede (Tom): Ready for Rope-San 😚
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats like when parents feed their babies and theyre like "here comes the plane" with the spoon of food
Afina (Georgia🍀): like thats the analogy my mind draws
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i do not like that analogy
Bill: ~~But the ropes don’t bother you~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🤔  ive never really considered it to be honest
Bill: This is decidedly more fun to tease Jess with.
Aldus (Jess): I've never used a rope thank you very much
Bill: I didn’t say you did. 😏
Elfriede (Tom): ropes would be **alot** of work tbh
Bill: ~~this’d be more fun if I had more than snark comments to add~~
Bill: Now off to have dinner cause everyone’s finally home.
Nokri (Marisa): how is this allowed at a con
Nokri (Marisa): how is she comfortable
Bill: such butt, much wow.
Bill: "Targeted Therapy"
