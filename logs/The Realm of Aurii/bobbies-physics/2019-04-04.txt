Aldus Larian (Jess): <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Bill: ~~does it. Kinda look like she used the comic book filter on this~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): little bit? might be whatever filter she did use giving a similar effect
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Oof.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): THAT'S NOT WHERE WANDS ARE SUPPOSED TO GO <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

Bill: Wizards don't have electricity, I'm sure they've got a vibrator setting on those things.
Bill: Tengentially, if you ever read a fanfic Erik, read this.http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/
Aldus Larian (Jess): 83 chapter wooowiee
Bill: only 230k.
Bill: That's a long boi, but quite managable.
Bill: Insane is black bond.
Bill: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9322278/1/Black-Bond
Bill: which, to be fair, is better than canon imo.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have seen 2 movies and read 1 book
Bill: probably not something for you to read.
Bill: Well. Larceny Lecery and Luna Lovegood goes off the rails somewhere around 8~10 chapters in and you just. Go with it.
Bill: It's the perfect crack fic cause it starts believable and just. slowly adds the chaos.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont even know what the longest fic i ever read was
Bill: The only once I remember the length specifically are Black Bond, cause it took a week to finish bingereading, and RWBY loops cause that shit ridiculous.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im not really into crack fics tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): Expansions on canon and AUs I like
Bill: I'm recommending it for Erik lol. Crack isn't usually my thing either, but I've read a few cause of the tvtropes recommendations and wasn't disappointed.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i know im just discussin <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Yeah, I think my favorite things are non canon what ifs.
Bill: Like, not 'what if Ruby didn't stop torchwick but X character did? See the same story told exactly the same except we replace Ruby with X'.
Bill: But the like... believable stories that could happen to the characters.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just looked up one i read awhile ago, its 73 chapters and almost 400,000 words that might be the longest
Bill: But anything that holds too close to canon has to be expansion or it baaaad.
Aldus Larian (Jess): depends on how its done for me
Bill: I've read... a wide majority of the stereotypical fanfics, but when it's literally 'canon beacon but Blake is Adam' and they go through the stations of canon 'initiation (jaune bullied, the docks...) the same way I'm just.
Bill: done.
Bill: *fuck* sunrise over Lylat is 700k? I've been following it so long I never realized.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea. but like same story from different character view i like or something like that
Bill: I don't usually go for those... Unless it's like, a completely different character from the main cast. Like... Julika from Ladybug.
Bill: THAT was fun.
Bill: But like, 'team JNPR but the plot of RWBY' nah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i think we have v. different fan fic tastes
Bill: Looking at my follows, most of what I like is AU, or character focused.
Bill: More crossover than I thought.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i dont like crossovers XD
Bill: Most are shit, but the tvtropes recommendations are usually pretty good at weeding them outl.
Bill: AU or canon compliant AU.
Bill: Pretty much.
Bill: I read a 'series of Blake x Ren' one shots apparently and liked it enough to follow it.
Bill: What.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i kinda just weed them my self
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Honestly, considering how easy it is to fuck up spells, I would not want a wand tip anywhere near my genitals
Bill: oof.
Bill: so much crap to weed through.
Bill: Every fanfic rec page for tvtropes starts with a parody of https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw
Bill: Larceny and Lechery will convince you otherwise.
Bill: it's not lewd. Or. It's not lemon.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just sort by kudos or hits and read the tags and the description. and then go from there
Bill: Yeah. I do that occasionally when I reallllly need more fics.
Bill: I canâ€™t remember the name of the rwby college au I like and now Iâ€™m annoyed.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): that sounds like a light novel title
Bill: HA
Bill: GOT IT
Bill: ~~it was the first one I clicked on in my AO3 bookmarks~~
Bill: https://archiveofourown.org/works/8249843/chapters/18904520
Bill: It's cute as heck.
Bill: Nora and Ren are like, pro vine makers at one point.
Bill: ~~it's about time I run through the rwby rec page again for new content isn't it~~
