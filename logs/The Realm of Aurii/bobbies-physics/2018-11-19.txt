The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): You gotta do some research
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i told you
Bill: um?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ummm
Bill: Shipping it is one thing, I knew japan is weird, but e-shuushuu does not usually have such sketch mood. Like, they want Aizawa to look creepy?
Bill: nani?
Bill: he's a good dude, don't do that to him.
Bill: oh no there's more.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): o no
Bill: 
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHY IS THIS A THING?
Bill: #japanisamistake
Bill: ```On a ship related note, there's Tsuyu/Aizawa, a popular couple in Japan that has almost no fans in the West and is mostly considered Squick. This is related to Values Dissonance, partially due to age of consent being lower in certain areas of Japan and moreso due to perceived ship tease between the two. The same also applies to the Aizawa/Midoriya and All Might/Midoriya ships, that are far more well received in Japan than in the west.```
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh true
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tom and i were talking about that the other day
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): federal age of consent is 13 in japan
Bill: That's... you haven't even started puberty, really.
Bill: Why.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): some prefectures its higher though
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NJ's is 16
Bill: At least your in puberty at that point, at 13 that's like... lolicon territory.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEET
Bill: *Not YEET, yeet is for good things*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is it? what are the rules on yeet?
Bill: idk it just feels wrong to yeet for lolicons.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i was more yeeting at the ridiculousness, not lolicons
Bill: VALID
Bill: At least this one isn't spicy.
