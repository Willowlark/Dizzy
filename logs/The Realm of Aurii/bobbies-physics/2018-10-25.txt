Bill: Can‚Äôt wait to see how they hint at Jumin‚Äôs bondage kink this time.
Bill: ~~almost wrote quirk rather than kink~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *nice*
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Look what you did. Look what you made them do <@!184437198865563648>
Bill: That's not even kinky yet.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): 
Bill: I'm sure it'll get better.
Bill: Chertiz knows their audience.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 50 shades of han vibes increase
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~why they gotta do my boi jumin dirty like dis~~
Bill: are you *kinkshaming* him?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Kinkshaming is her kink
Bill: *is it... or is it somethin else* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like fanon jumin is kink daddy but canon jumin is like "whatever you want MC"  namean?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Ye i feel that too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üôè
Bill: He can be both tho?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): It‚Äôs pretty much confirmed he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI bought you all this expensive junk because I was thinking about you while in Dubai‚Äù
Bill: Not like Chertiz writes 18+ content, we only get the hints of it.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Another story basically has an 18+ warning lol (I think it‚Äôs officially 16+?)
Bill: But not for sexual content.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Yeah, for some bad ends there‚Äôs bad content
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Saeran nearly rapes MC in the main story
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üò≠
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): big oofs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): why the do him dirty
Bill: *He's sort of a criminal soooo*
Total Nok-out (Marisa): *you take that back*
Bill: Me, from the V camp: *Come and shoot us like did Yoosung you criminal*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Saeran and Jumin get the kink daddy labels  cuz of the fucked up things they do in thier routes and i wish they didnt
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): does that make sense? like i love thier routes but they go just a tad to far
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Ye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~i still love them both so much tho~~
Bill: Saeran *is* the bad boy.
Bill: Jumin gets the label from the bad ends though doesn't he?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea, and the cage thing i assume (which he only jokes about once and then MC has to push to make happen)
Bill: Right... I think the bad ends are kinda... ooc? Like, they take things to such extremes they aren't a great basis.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like jumin wouldnt actually be all that kinky? i almost feel like if he was, he'd want to be the submissive cuz of him having to be so in control of everything all the time, feel like he needs some escaping from that. Like the fandom makes him 50 shades of han but it feels ooc to me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea the bad ends are supposed to be the person getting pushed to their absolute limits
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well some at least
Bill: nah, I see it. He's a caring guy, would do anything for MC, but like. He a controlly guy.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but the fandom does alot of "pain vs pleasure" play and i kinda feel like jumin would treat MC like shes fragile in bed and not do like anything painful unless she explicitly asked
Bill: Yeaaah, I don't see a pain kink.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): then again the fandom makes them all kinky so  ü§∑
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if you told me years ago that id be analyzing the sexual tendencies of boys from a mobile game i would not have believed you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but here i am
Alfrick(Tim): I would have
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): someone believed in me
