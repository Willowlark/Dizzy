Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~"Im not interested in cosplaying raven, and im not interested in talk to you"~~
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): do you think "i'm also really awkward and don't know how to talk to people so i'm ending this conversation" would be a decent creep deterrent

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHAT NO

No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): oh phew at least it's to your cosplay page and not your personal
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): but that sucks when you ignore it on the cosplay page because then it lowers your statistics or whatever. facebook sucks.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): _what the fuck does the rest of that message say_
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): _im Curious but I don‚Äôt want it_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): üò≠
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i hear that sometimes, sooometimes if you're not connected to wifi and you put your phone on airplane mode you can check messages and it won't register as read. but it's super risky and doesn't always work.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I gotta look
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): be careful soldier
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I LOOKED

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its like in season 5 when hazel touches ren, and nora freaks out sept its pyrha
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I closed my phone and I keep getting messages
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NO NO NO
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Like they‚Äôre just extrapolations on the same subject
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): 
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): this jersey

No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): in the british isles
Bill: I *swear* to god, you are not taking after Marisa and letting wack jobs message you on end.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I‚Äôm not gonna answerrrr
I do what I want(tm): Yo I'd just tell him he's coming on too strong an making you uncomfortable
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "actually im moving to California in a few days"
I do what I want(tm): And if it bothers him too much block him
Bill: Then don't even give him the chance to *think* you might 'just be busy' or 'she'll get back to me after the movie she must be in'. If his behavior is uncomfortable, you *react. Appropriately.*
Bill: louder for the idiots in the back.
Dave: Block him
Bill: ***React. Appropriately.***
Bill: You aren't going to be helping him by ghosting him and getting progressively more annoyed. He'll either get more persistent a la Marisa's stalker, or move and repeat this to the next girl he sees.
Bill: It could be Jess.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): girls are conditioned from a young age to non-confrontational this way. we scared.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ‚òù
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): don't worry i have restraining orders against my irl stalkers
Bill: You wouldn't want to let him think his approach is just fine and *you're* the bad person, so he'll do it to someone else.
Bill: Georgia is trying to get into an elusive position at NASA, is a double major, woman in STEM, ace cosplayer, and all around class act. Fuck conditioning, you have every right to say what you feel. You'll need to in your job one day.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Marisa has a point though
Bill: That goes for Jess and Marisa as well. You aren't starting an inquisition, you are using a feature of social media *designed* to keep people from harassing you.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): SCREAMS AND THROWS THIS
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im not saying you are wrong, and she should block him but its a weird spot to be in and alot of girls react this way
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): 
Bill: It's the internet equivalent of going to the bathroom to escape.
Bill: yeah, I sympathize some Jess. No one fucks with my friends tho.
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i've got 2 bachelors in studying people and i know it's dumb to be scared, i know all the theory behind how people think and what causes them to act in such manners. true nothing will probably happen from telling it to him straight and there probably won't be any repercussions from blocking him. but knowing it is different from acting on it because we're still scared and there's always that little nagging voice in our conscience ; u ;
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): good response georgia-chan
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHAT ARE THE DOTS
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): like biru it's how you kept saying you were afraid of being creepy even though you're not. we know it's silly but it's still scary to act out.

aww good! though it looks like he has more to say mm
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): OH WHAT
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): 
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): OH
MY GOODNESS
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I WILL NOT RESPOND TO GUILT TRIPPING SIR
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): HERE WE GO
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): classic fucking response
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): he's totally baiting you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): (yea its internalized fear that refusing  will only cause it to escalate)
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I KNOOOW PEOPLE DO THIS SOMETIMES
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Like how dare you insult my intelligence by trying to guilt trip me
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Omg that‚Äôs a huge pet peeve
Bill: ~~if you block them they can't pull this shit~~
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): _ they‚Äôre trying to make me feel sorry but I‚Äôm not gonna feel sorry just cause they tell me to_
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Ooooo that gets on my nerves
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): If he sends one more uncomfortable message it‚Äôs blocking time
Bill: ü§¶
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "I know you are trying to guilt trip me, its not going to worl. I suggest you do some research on how to talk to people" üõë
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Oof jess that‚Äôs so harsh
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, have a good day‚Äù
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): "~~if you try to guilt trip people like this then yeah i guess you are~~"
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): too m ean
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): If he‚Äôs really sorry then it‚Äôs okay for him to enjoy my cosplay stuff from afar
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Any more and it‚Äôs BAN HAMMER OF SHAME
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Oof MARISA SAVAGE
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i'm rude now
Bill: Yes Marisa.
Bill: Embrace your inner Nokri.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "your behavior is problematic and inappropriate"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): GOD i really hope thats the last of that üôè
Bill: The goal is to deescalate though.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): then just send really deep fried memes
Bill: nah.
Bill: Memes are basically how you confess love now.
That's why Tom sends Jess memes all day.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): photoshop his facebook icon onto the left here
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): 
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): THE BAN HAMMER HAS SWUNG
Bill: Thank you, ffs.
Bill: *Marisa learn from Georgia.*
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): omg dude can't just keep messaging that's just elongating the guilty trip
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WE WERE NEVER FRIENDS
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ^^^^^^^
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): lol
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): 10 minutes he was introducing himself
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that isnt how yu make friends omgg
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): _i have better things to do than answer pestering boys_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): GOOD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that was really bad
Bill: Why do you enjoy the fame, jesus.

Bill: Good.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i have my key knife, i should probably start taking that with me
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): to cons i mena
Bill: Carrying a knife is never a bad idea.
Bill: ~~except to sport events or on air planes~~
