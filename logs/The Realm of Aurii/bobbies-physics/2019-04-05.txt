Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜­
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): SEKIRO THAT IS A LITTLE BOY
Bill: Oh. Sakimi rewards.
Bill: So she included all the nier ones this time around. Including 9S X 2B. ðŸ‘€
Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WOW
Elfriede Faun (Tom): DICC
Bill: Thereâ€™s no bra/underwear version too.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's just a banana since they have no genitals
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is it me or do his lower legs just disproportionately small
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEP
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sakimi
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): proportions are hard for her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FragrantWelloffHapuka-size_restricted.gif
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeeeee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Now I can't unsee
Glonk: All his leg thickness got put in his dick
Elfriede Faun (Tom): My phone tried to correct Genitals to Gentiles
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): his lower leg is only like, twice the length of his dick
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which appears to be a relatively normal size?
Bill: ~~yâ€™all ruining every photo by making me unable to ignore the bad proportions~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theyre SO off though
Glonk: ~~probably correct proportions for dick~~
Bill: You arenâ€™t wrong.
Bill: ~~correct assuming androids have dick~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THEY DO NOT
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But I do like the art regardless
Elfriede Faun (Tom): If I ignore the tiny leg
Bill: Ye it good. Much less airbag titty too.
Bill: ~~apparently she did one of A2 x 2B.~~
Bill: ~~A2 gets further than 9S~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's also non canon in nines
Elfriede Faun (Tom): She always scales all her dudes up
Bill: Well, at least sheâ€™s equal opportunity.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YES
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I am glad for that
Bill: ~~should see Leonâ€™s dong~~
Bill: She definitely enjoyed that one.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think I'm just so overexposed to her art
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is that a pod in your pocket or are you just happy to see 2B
Bill: Possible. I do like that she makes a lot of it, cause it justifies paying for the Patreon.
Bill: If she put out one or two things a month I would not want to pay the 14 bucks for em.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah, unfortunately also prob the same reason she can't take more time to draw
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And everyone starts to look the same
Bill: that's been true for a long time...
Bill: Actual nudity spoiler
Bill: *never* saw that one before.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): A2 looks so mad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~angrily lick the nip nop~*
Bill: yeee that some hate fuck.
Bill: *Sakimi does best doing the romantic couples, why you get hate fuck kinky*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah. Romantic is always better imo
Bill: She tends to calm down on the over specialization with the really coupley ones and I like that.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also it doesn't really make sense for them
Bill: I think my favorite one she ever did was _Inuyasha_, just because itâ€™s really romantic and cute.
Bill: Oh, and a Noctis Luna one.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Shessomaru one?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Or inuyasha an kagome
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The only thing that's a bit wierd about the Seshomaru one is that girl is like 8 in the he show
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I get she aged her up but like bruh
Bill: while I'm in the folder, Watermelon tit 2B without lingerie. For comparison.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Seshomaru is a beautiful character tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 2B dropped her areolae somewhere I suppose
Bill: Like this one. No mega tits or Ahegao. Just. couple.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That good
Bill: League couple also good.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And the feathered couple from
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEAH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And the other one
Elfriede Faun (Tom): In the water
Bill: Not Sessoumaru. Kagome.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Xayah and Rakan
Bill: Oh, the water one still pretty mega tit.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah but still cute
Bill: 
Bill: LOL
Bill: Some shitpost page had a bunch of characters doing a casting couch. The Yoko taro quote is gold.
