Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WOWIE
One hop this time (Tom): she looks really uninterested in those two penises
Bill: I'm now mildly curious what the artistic differences between male focused and female focused CGs is like.
Bill: Like, for research purposes, not for da tit.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): that's one of the biggest differences, chest size <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Never seen a CG like this before, where the guy's face is the focus.
Bill: pfft fair point.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): These banner ads are really districting
One hop this time (Tom): the biggest difference
One hop this time (Tom): is showing the dudes fucking face

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oof

No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): like mystic mess
One hop this time (Tom): censorship laws are ...odd
One hop this time (Tom): like its a porn game why is the penis censored ðŸ¤”
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): because lewd and illegal
Bill: 
Bill: It looks so... not bestiality.
One hop this time (Tom): but like only enough where all you have to do is squint
Bill: OOF NOPE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Penises are illegal
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is she only a child when they arnt having sex? I'm still confused
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oh is it like that little mermaid manga where she's only human when
Bill: ~~the rest of the CGs looked so normal, why dog do that~~
Bill: I have no idea.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): good
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WAIT there's beastiality too?
Bill: Not in that one, in the second one.
Bill: with the price dudes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh oh ok
Bill: I'm now on a quest to find an otome game without the weird kink stuff.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): brother's conflict. the only horrifying thing about that is all the love interests are her adopted brothers.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oh and her pet squirrel is a secret love interest i think
One hop this time (Tom): *oh*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is that all?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ya just a girl, her 13 adopted brothers and her pet squirrel
Bill: well, two have come up duds cause the CG don't exist online.
Bill: ~~what's the secret going to be~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Is this the little mermaid
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): no it's ningyo no hiyaku wa koi no jumon
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oh it says it right in the title
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the secret is her love spell
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): 0/10 game ruined
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "lit tle mer ma I'd"
Bill: 
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): NO!! NO1!!!!!!!
Bill: ~~are you sure this is an otome game, it sounds bad enough to be a regular VN~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): but otome games are vn
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye
Bill: HA
Bill: the english title (it's getting an english release?) is listed as "Fxxx me Royally; Horny Magical Princess",
Bill: That's just hilarious.
One hop this time (Tom): pfffft
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wow v. Nice
Bill: Oh get this, same studio as the child one.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~equality~~
Bill: Not quite.
Bill: People are much less motivated to upload the CG for the otome stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Well yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's be gay
Bill: I don't get why tho, I mean... sex is sex?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No no you see these guys have actual bodies and faces and not just dicks with ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜¬ faces
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): They're also detailed and not just a pile of blurry lines
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH AND EYES big one there
Bill: you know I'd expect something getting an english release would be easier to find.
Bill: Alright fine I give up.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Your effort is appreciated
Bill: It's going to annoy me I couldn't find it but.
Bill: https://vndb.org/v/all?q=&fil=tag_inc-542~23.tagspoil-0&rfil=&s=title&o=a
