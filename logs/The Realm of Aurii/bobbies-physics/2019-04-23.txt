Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: *What now*
Bill: *what now* (GoT spoiler)
Bill: I don't know if anyone's watching it but *lordie* can you not GoT?
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i saw that on the tumbls
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): .....i might be the odd one out here but arya is canonically 18, and maisie is 22
Bill: Oh, I have no idea what's going on in the show. I just remember she's the young one.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and its like one of the only sex scenes in GoT  that is consentual
Bill: ~~and with GoT I assume it's rape~~
Bill: it's *NOT*?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no its like a real love scene and it doesnt show anything
Bill: oh, that's wonderful then.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it shows arya undressing then kissing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): then it cuts out
Bill: Oh yeah, I wouldn't find that weird.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so seeing all the hate its getting makes me feel really bad for maisie
Bill: Certainly not compared to EVERYTHING ELSE in that show.
Bill: Ye, if that's the case I'm all for it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye, its one of my favorite scenes fromt he whols show, it shows two characters growth. and their reunion, and how even after everything arya can still love
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its like a really nice scene xD
Bill: It sounds it. Like I said, all I saw was the meme and kinda assumed it'd be rape given... everything else in the show.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): valid
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Bill: I'm glad someone could explain though. ~~I shared it hoping~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea from hat i saw of the scence i liked it?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My sister was like WE SAW YOUR TITTIES
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not me, arya lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know anything about GoT but seemed pretty good even without context
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): people seem to think maisie/arya is like..really young when shes not at all
Bill: That was about to get weird.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Bill: Nah. I love her acting though.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes great, my favorite character, the sole reason i watch the show
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s cause thrones has been going so long it’s like she grew up with the viewers
Bill: YEAH when I would watch episodes the only one I cared about was Arya.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): exactly
Bill: Cause instead of scheming she was like "You people are fucking insane, I'mma stab you".
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea arya seems coo af
Bill: And I *appreciate that*.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): MOOD yea that about sums it up though
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes like totally done with all the bullshit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and just wants to be safe and if anyone gets in her way of protecting herself and her family they just gonna die
Bill: Which is me to the entire series.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fucking same
Bill: You can't be *this* backstab happy.
Bill: Everyone in the series is happier ruining someone else's life *just because* and that gets really old really fast.
Bill: who was the scene with? I thought I saw it but must have been in a comment on facebook.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have like a deep value of ..MAYBE 3 characters and they have been my only reason to watch the show since like season 3
Bill: That one guy whose like, the king's bastard of somewhere or something?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the sex scene? it was maisie williams and joe dempsie (gendry)
Bill: Gendry is....
Bill: I don't remember the characters.
Bill: and the actors don't really matter for the story purposes.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hes the bastard of the baratheons
Bill: YEAH that sounds like the one I'm talking about.
Bill: Too many fucking characters.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i cant keep up

Bill: Looooooool
Bill: She’s hilarious.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): god ok real talk i feel really bad for her though, like what shouldve been an empowering moment for her is not like 5x more embarassing than it has to be because the internet blew up saying how  "uncomfortable" they were watching it
Bill: And like. Every actress whose done a sex scene has had this happen? Why it so significant now.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cuz it's the same show and she started at age 16 I'm assuming
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): how fucking dare she age
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she started at age 11
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): technically
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): GOT HAS BEEN GOING ON THAT LONG???

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hoyl shit she was tiny
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh yeah
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Idk how I got confusef
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That'd be like if hermoi e had a sex scene at the end of harry potter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Me: Kind of want to wawtch GoT
Also me: But that's so much to watch...
Also also me: You've binged *The Office* which has even more content
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): she did have that makeout scene that was really weird in the last movie
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): well, the kiss is canon to the book, just under different circumstances
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but the movie made it more fan-servicey
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Movie?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it was like a whole extended thing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): There's a got movie?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Shiit
N🆗ri (Marisa): harry pottah
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ooo yee
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): **Book**
Ron: WAIT WE HAVE TO SAVE THE HOUSE ELVES!
*~spontaneous kiss fueled by his concern over something she's passionate about~*

**Movie**
*~stabs horcrux~*
*~spontaneous snogging fueled by scary water~*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait then who was Harry’s delusion about. Ginny making out with someone? That’s just as bad
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was wondering “which kiss in the office” cause my brain had yet to move on from the topic
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): THAT MAKE OUT SCENE
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH THE REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE ONE THAT WAS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY
Bill: wait, which where? I'm getting confused.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought you meant Ron and Hermione kissing at the end
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Horcrux Harry and Hermione making out to fuck with Ron before he slashed the locket
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooo yeah that's it, it was ron's delusion
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAW47nRugEs
Bill: oh I vaguely remember that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): a scene I try to repress
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh god
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh god i removed that from my memory
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but here it is
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not sure if they actually were filmed making out or if it's CG (hard to tell since there's a lot of CG over it anyway)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but that must have been uncomfortable for the actors too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I guess that's acting ?shrugs
N🆗ri (Marisa): which would be worse, being asked to do that as your job or having someone 3D reconstruct you making out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): /shrugs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then imagine being the CG animator having to animate that...
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH YEAH I SAW YHAT CLIP
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Since I never saw the last two movies
