Bill: Hunter did a good job. Could do better than the obvious backdrop at Caseyâ€™s apartment but Iâ€™m guessing it was the best option. (I have a thing about the backdrop cause I notice it in all of Caseyâ€™s stuff)
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye its a good angle and positioning
Bill: Lightâ€™s soft too.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and v cute

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): too dark and too warm
Bill: Especially Casey and Mist, they look Flash lit which is a *gross* look.
