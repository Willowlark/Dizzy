Nokri (Marisa): oh look she made a friend
Nokri (Marisa): they're airbags!
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Noooo
Bill: relevant.
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Ooooffff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yikes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what's sad is she could just fill up containers with mildly soapy water and say it's her bath water
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *and people would buy it*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and what would people even do with it, stick their dick in it?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): humans are weird
Nokri (Marisa): o i figured people would pour it into their own bath water, like some kind of bath bomb
Bill: you are better off not asking too many questions about what they will do.
Nokri (Marisa): or wash their face with it or something
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Prob most will just keep it
El氣電e Faun (Tom): And be like, ahh yes this is that one girls bath water
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Yeah.. dope
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *until it eventually evaporates*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ... what if they... smell it
Nokri (Marisa): dab it on themselves like cologne
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Yeah I was thinking smelling it is likely
