Nokri (Marisa): this is really gross but just imagine the executives nickelodeon going over this script and being like ðŸ¤”
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): excuse me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): what the fuck
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): #notmyholes ðŸ˜‚
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what the fuck lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh it's even worse imagining Shia Lebouff doing that scene
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wasn't it a book?
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): after this script was written they were like "lets just ask the author to write the movie"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does that happen in the book
Nokri (Marisa): **n o p e**
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): imagine the author reading that script
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wtf
Nokri (Marisa): the final movie is a pretty spot-on representation of the book
Nokri (Marisa): they showed it to us in elementary school after reading the book
now imagine showing the original-script movie to a class of 3rd graders <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah Holes was probably one of the best book-to-movie adaptations
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the biggest difference was that the main character was overweight in the book
Nokri (Marisa): and there was one scene where stanley gets messed up by someone hitting him with a shovel while digging in the book but they didn't include that in the movie. it might be a deleted scene though?
everything else is fairly identical
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm looking at the Wiki page and I just realized that Zero's nickname is "Zero" because his last name is "Zeroni"
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!! That and because they think heâ€™s stupid and thereâ€™s 0 info in his head. Good double pun.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I just remember the stupid part because that's what they stressed in the movie
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Dig It" was my jam back in 2003
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Called in to Radio Disney to request it lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then I got the mutha fuckin soundtrack and didn't have to listen to the crappy AM static version ðŸ˜Ž
