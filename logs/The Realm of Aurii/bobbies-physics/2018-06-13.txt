Nokri (Marisa): was really happy with this trailer because it actually looks really great, the character designs are awesome.
and then the fanservice kicked in overdrive and it became a disappointment.

Bill: *What kind of series do you think it is*
Nokri (Marisa): i'm fully caught up on the manga, i just block that stuff out of my memory permanently so it's very jarring to see it again
Bill: I've read a good portion of that.
Bill: It's like, grade A fanservice garbage.
Nokri (Marisa): there's a plot somewhere. about the loli demon king who likes cookies and was born from the cat girl or something.
Bill: Another world ‚úÖ 
Lonely Otaku MC ‚úÖ 
MC get game breaking powers ‚úÖ 
Girls are literally enslaved to MC within minutes of arrival ‚úÖ 
Girls love him anyway ‚úÖ 
There is only one male in this series ‚Ñ¢ ‚úÖ
Nokri (Marisa): wait which series are you describing again
i've narrowed it down to about 350
Bill: hell, the fights were "Good thing I'm level 80, I can just nuke this encounter".
Bill: And then everyone who saw wanted his dick.
Nokri (Marisa): naw there's another guy in that manga. the creepy rapey elf brother guy.
Nokri (Marisa): that he beats up
Nokri (Marisa): or something
Bill: *and then elf girl jumps his dick*
Nokri (Marisa): I found my favorite isekai manga in a magazine the other day and was very disappointed it didn't come with free stuff but also it's the best isekai
Bill: Face it Marisa, all this needs is the HCG and it's eroge.
Nokri (Marisa): Human chorionic gonadotropin
Aldus (Jess): ~~konosuba?~~
Nokri (Marisa): a pregnancy hormone? there was already pregnancy fetish stuff
Bill: ~~*You right tho*~~~
Bill: Konosuba is best isekai.
Nokri (Marisa): best anime perhaps but not manga or novel
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): best isekai
Nokri (Marisa): Otome Game no Hametsu Flag shika nai Akuyaku Reijou ni Tensei shite shimatta
Nokri (Marisa): you can tell it's the best because of how long its name is
Aldus (Jess): the name itsself is a light novel wtf
Nokri (Marisa): that's the sign of quality
Aldus (Jess): tom likes konosuba, i cant really get into it though
Nokri (Marisa): konosuba did have a rap battle
Aldus (Jess): ~~i get annoyed all the female characters are dumb and useless~~
Bill: So is whats his name.
Bill: The point is they're all useless.
Bill: Kazuma.
Aldus (Jess): #notmykazuma
Bill: It's a parody of all the shitty isekai tropes that exist.
Bill: Imagine Konosuba taking itself serious, and you get the show Mawisa linked.
Bill: (the trailer)
Aldus (Jess): ~~at least that guys hot~~
Nokri (Marisa): oooo yeah demon lord slave guy
Bill: ~~Just wait till he starts talking~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~imma just file em both under garbage~~
Bill: He's weeb trash.
Aldus (Jess): every time you 2 talk about anime i have to google at least one thing XD
Bill: *"Aaaaah, oh my god, this HOT ELF GIRL just like in my PORN is my SLAVE?! I could do all sorts of <imagine spot> no wait, I could never do that, I'm just an ORDINARY HIGH SCHOOL student on the inside! I guess I'll be AWKWARD AND WEIRD instead! <does that> OOOOOOMG she loves me for being weird, how UNIQUE and ORIGINAL"*
Bill: Escapism at it's finest.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): oh no they're giving away fire emblem AND katarina stuff idk which to apply for
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: "at least that guy's hot" 
Me checks<
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: White hair
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Ofc
Bill: ~~but it's not long~~
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Could literally be kazuma worth white hair
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Boom instantly hot
Aldus (Jess): escuse that face tattoo is BA
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Face tatoo?
Aldus (Jess): yea the white haired boy has a face tattoo
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): im like 90% joking with all of this btw
Bill: ~~Tom deletes the message to Mikey about where he got his tattoos~~
Nokri (Marisa): this is all 100% serious discussion jess pls
Nokri (Marisa): the fire emblem manga looks pretty good tbh
Aldus (Jess): LOL
Nokri (Marisa): *jess what did i just say*
Bill: ~~Serious discussion about Marisa reading a soft core porn manga~~
Nokri (Marisa): no no i block all the bad parts out my mind has a filter
Nokri (Marisa): look at the cute fire emblems
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: Hey, you can appreciate de tits. We won't judge.
Aldus (Jess): thats a big book
Nokri (Marisa): i just got finished reading feast for a king and had to rush through *so much*
Aldus (Jess): but den why reads it?
Nokri (Marisa): the otome game manga is hilarious though highly recommend, its also pretty different at parts from the web novel which has fan translations but the web novel is SUPER repetitive at times
Nokri (Marisa): i must consume all media content
Nokri (Marisa): i've run out of other stuff to read
Nokri (Marisa): and it was interesting when it wasn't disgusting
Aldus (Jess): "it was interesting when it wasn't disgusting"
Aldus (Jess): classic
Aldus (Jess): tom turned up just long enough to get salty i dont like konosuba üòÇ
Aldus (Jess): shit hes back hide me
Nokri (Marisa): quick talk about more anime
Bill: Marisa: Read some much manga she has to read porn doujin for new content.
Nokri (Marisa): it's only rated 18+ i wouldn't read pure smut unless there was a censored version and it was popular enough to warrant that
Nokri (Marisa): killing stalking was messed up too how did that get popular with yuri on ice fans
Aldus (Jess): they wild
Nokri (Marisa): feast for a king is 50/50 it's either stuff no one should ever look at which needs to be wiped from this world
or
Aldus (Jess): WHAT EVEN lmao
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: What
Nokri (Marisa): either v cute or v disturbing no in between with this series
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): otome game series is great 10/10 it's about a girl who is reincarnated into the love rival / villain of an otome game and in order to not die horribly or be expelled from the country when the heroine shows up she tries all this weird stuff but she winds up making every single person (all the guys and the heroine and all the other girls) fall in love with her. beautiful.
Nokri (Marisa): but she's too dense to realize they all like her
Aldus (Jess): 10/10
Bill: ~~is it actually trash though~~
Bill: like, it sounds like it could be fun, but I've been fooled before.
Nokri (Marisa): i think it's great but also i am biased because it's wonderful. i enjoyed the novel more than the comic just because it had more details but the manga isn't bad.
Nokri (Marisa): it's short too, the manga has 9 chapters so far but it's already like over halfway through the series
Nokri (Marisa): have you read Kumo desu ga, Nani ka?
it's a little similar to that, manga-wise.
Bill: nah.
Nokri (Marisa): ~~here's the first chapter try it yourself~~
http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Otome-Game-no-Hametsu-Flag-shika-nai-Akuyaku-Reijou-ni-Tensei-shite-shimatta/Ch-001?id=390201
Nokri (Marisa): kumo desu ga is interesting but *man* is it taking her forever to get out of the dungeon. it's basically video game grinding: the manga.
Nokri (Marisa): and the manga of that is better than the novel of that imo
Nokri (Marisa): in the Otome Game one everyone is 100% aware that the protagonist is an idiot
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: AH YEA THE SPECIAL SEX HATS
Bill: nani.
Nokri (Marisa): scroll up
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): literally i have to read about the god pan and its just goat dicks everywhere what the fuck
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): its literally just slides of goat dick
Aldus (Jess): WJBIBNWDB WHAT
Bill: what do you expect, greeks had nothing better to do than fuck.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): like teacher sir
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): i could learn about pan without the visual thanks
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): 
Aldus (Jess): wow!
Aldus (Jess): there was a kid in highschool everyone said fucked a goat
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): theres this one too
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): 
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): like I DONT NEED THESE TO LEARN
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Run from the goat dick ma'am
