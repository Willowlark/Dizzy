NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): this is from a shoot for a playboy magazine but it's the perfect example of how famous japanese cosplayers pose at cosplay events
they don't stay in one pose for more than two or three seconds they're constantly shifting around and changing pose

Bill: I've seen clips of pro models doing things basically like that too.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i feel like that'd be the worst thing for a photoshoot here because you finally get a good pose and it's like "lol nope missed your chance"
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): really?
Bill: If you're in a controlled lighting environment, you don't have to worry about the shot being under lit or weird so you can snap, got it, move on.
Bill: Requires confidence.
Bill: More than any of the photographers we know have.
Bill: Myself included.
Bill: Plus, it's a skill learned by the model right? To know what poses they want and keep cycling. Usually the posing process goes 'anything you want to do?' 'nope' 'uhhhh' 'lets i dunno'.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): it's really funny when they're doing it at a con though surrounded by 800 people in a random field
Bill: though she's not pausing quite long enough I'd say.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah no pause ever just keep moving
Bill: yeeee like, you'd need lots of experience or trust between model/photog to make it wokr.
Bill: Georgia and I could pull it off, though usually we're the 'uhhhh' on the poses type.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): the girl in the video is the same girl as
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
Bill: that I don't get.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
Bill: maybe two people in that crowd are getting good shoots.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): and she does the same constantly changing poses while also rotating slowly every few seconds to face more people
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she prob spins
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): yee!
Bill: still like.
Bill: oof.
Bill: So much effort, so much being packed by 100 sweaty weebs, and you have to wait for her to rotate around to you.
Bill: Fuck it.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): people do get good shots but they're also really funny
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): nice backdrop
Bill: That whole thing is like the gazebo, just. Not worth the effort.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): HUMAN GAZEBO
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): and then because of privacy laws everyone's face has to be blurred out so if the background of your shot isn't blurred you gotta do this before posting it online anywhere
Bill: fuck japanese cons tbh.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): they're good times ðŸ˜Ž 
stampedes, lines, strict rules and cosplay areas. awesome.
Bill: No thank.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): this girl makes $10,000 every comiket
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): wtf
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): she sells prints and photobooks and makes absolute bank as the #1 cosplayer
Bill: ~~are they lewd~~
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): $20-$25 a book :0
my friend sells his cosplay books at comiket for like $5 a piece and he gave me free soap from malaysia with my last purchase
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): ssssssomewhat
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): 
Bill: damn the japanese and their obsession with the fairer sex.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah they are here are previews from her book

Bill: so like. 16+ stuff.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): nah it's not because he's a guy it's because he's not enako, other girl cosplayers sell theirs for like $5 apiece too. i have a few and they're all really inexpensive
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): stuff that'd be normal in a children's anime but is lewd irl
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): so they can get away with lewd because "it's in the animes uwu"
