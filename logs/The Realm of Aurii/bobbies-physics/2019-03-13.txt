N🆗ri (Marisa): i found the dangan ronpa shoot photo
yikes
N🆗ri (Marisa): but like she was aware of it????? she commented on it afterwards???
Bill: I was at one fate shoot where she was like 'i'll do the panty shot' and I just didn't shoot that shot cause it was weird.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH i took at least 5-6 pictures for each shot but i noticed i literally just took two of the junkos. the first one i was like :/ and then the second one is a close up of her and monokuma's face because i couldn't get the other two's faces
N🆗ri (Marisa): and her skirt is already so short how did she get away with this
N🆗ri (Marisa): should i post
Bill: you can.
N🆗ri (Marisa): im trying to find a way to crop it and upload it to the shoot album but like. there's no way.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Add a censor bar
N🆗ri (Marisa): that is the only way. would she get mad tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably
N🆗ri (Marisa): on the other hand i'd get banned from facebook posting it uncensored probably
Bill: I'd just not post.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): file's too big to copy paste so here's screenshot
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it wasn't an accident she had the other leg up first and then was like "no let me switch" *and then commented on how we all got a "good show" afterwards like what????*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh yikes
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wonder how those girls faces looked the poor things
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"If I show my ass and vagina, I'll get famous!"*
Bill: Definitely intentional flash.
Aldus Larian (Jess): imagine you getting heavy with a guy and you pull off his pants and he's got these on

Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~imma make tom wear space undies and georgias nasa shirt for boudoir~~
Bill: For. What boudoir.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh right i forgot there was shedule conflict
Aldus Larian (Jess): rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): well we could do it another time
Bill: No I mean, we hadn’t figured out when to do a shoot at Zenkai yet. That’s true.
Bill: But what cosplay is space themed?
Aldus Larian (Jess): seven!
Aldus Larian (Jess): he always talks about space
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): get married on the moon
Bill: Aaaah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "go to the space station"
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!386874959009415170>  what did u wear for your boudoir?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was just shirtless
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): still wearing shorts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but we hid them under the covers
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo ok yea that makes sense
Bill: Your thinking MC and Seven for Zenkai?
Aldus Larian (Jess): or 9s 2b idk yet
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont know what <@!351785752197201920>  is comfortable wearing
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NASA crop top
Aldus Larian (Jess): but what about on bottom? XD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NASA CROP TOP
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~im glad u understand your character~~
Bill: First thing is the tone of the shoot. I know for you it couple intimacy, but is it like “tearing clothes off each other in passion” or “soft moment”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://smile.amazon.com/INTERESTPRINT-Boxer-Briefs-Underwear-XS-3XL/dp/B07K4KDX3N/ref=sr_1_23?keywords=galaxy%2Bunderwear&qid=1552497373&rnid=2941120011&s=apparel&sr=1-23&th=1&psc=1

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have these four but I’ll probably wear the navy blue starry night one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I can’t find my white nasa hoodie, big sad
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👌
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): am i obsessed? mebbe lil bit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i'm really glad you like that one, i was sad it didnt come in time for the secret santa xD~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like the red sleeve one

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE I LOVE THE STARRY NIGHT ONE

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I MEAN, what i have for outfit is kinda SPICY
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i can tone it down
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i might ask for opinions on lingerie later~~
Bill: You don't have to.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the big spice
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah I just wore pants for decency. I might wear skirt.
Bill: Depending though, I think you want *some* partial clothing so you can kinda.. strip as the shoot goes down.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Clothing can be applied and or removed.
Bill: Like you a couple getting frisky.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): leggy out real far
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im tryna find photos where you dont have to eat each others faces
Bill: The trend I found with couple shoots is they tend to have partial clothing. It's less about tit/ass/abs/dick and more about the intimate touching.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but vore is *in*
Bill: Cancelled.
