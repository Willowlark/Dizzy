NüÜóri (Marisa): i found the dangan ronpa shoot photo
yikes
NüÜóri (Marisa): but like she was aware of it????? she commented on it afterwards???
Bill: I was at one fate shoot where she was like 'i'll do the panty shot' and I just didn't shoot that shot cause it was weird.
NüÜóri (Marisa): YEAH i took at least 5-6 pictures for each shot but i noticed i literally just took two of the junkos. the first one i was like :/ and then the second one is a close up of her and monokuma's face because i couldn't get the other two's faces
NüÜóri (Marisa): and her skirt is already so short how did she get away with this
NüÜóri (Marisa): should i post
Bill: you can.
NüÜóri (Marisa): im trying to find a way to crop it and upload it to the shoot album but like. there's no way.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Add a censor bar
NüÜóri (Marisa): that is the only way. would she get mad tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably
NüÜóri (Marisa): on the other hand i'd get banned from facebook posting it uncensored probably
Bill: I'd just not post.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah
NüÜóri (Marisa): file's too big to copy paste so here's screenshot
NüÜóri (Marisa): and it wasn't an accident she had the other leg up first and then was like "no let me switch" *and then commented on how we all got a "good show" afterwards like what????*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh yikes
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
NüÜóri (Marisa): i wonder how those girls faces looked the poor things
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"If I show my ass and vagina, I'll get famous!"*
Bill: Definitely intentional flash.
Aldus Larian (Jess): imagine you getting heavy with a guy and you pull off his pants and he's got these on

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im tryna find photos where you dont have to eat each others faces
Bill: The trend I found with couple shoots is they tend to have partial clothing. It's less about tit/ass/abs/dick and more about the intimate touching.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but vore is *in*
