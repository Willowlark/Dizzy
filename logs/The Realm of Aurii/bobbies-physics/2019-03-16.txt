Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _plz be iida_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You do swim Iida too? owo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I honestly think you should get like those Japanese school swimsuits if you could cause that’s SO iida
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I PUT MINE ON THE WRONG SIDE TOO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): and had to fix it
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But YEAH you look good!
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH that was my idea!!  i'm kind of shocked i don't have the typical japanese school swimsuit. that would be cool. it's neat how yours is really similar to the hero/gym suits that's an awesome match
Bill: no gym required.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Gym required for rippling 6 pack <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I know! Target has really good swimsuits right now.
Bill: Not that you need it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If you wanna get a new swimsuit for the season I would go now cause they have all colors and sizes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 6 pack 💪
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok I can use mAh booty shorts if I have to but I'mma try to get to a Target or Walmart for something better
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think this werk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): omg Georgia cute Todo!!!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THANK!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and cute MC!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thanky
Bill: booty shorts seems kinda MC actually.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Spicy Jess 🌶🌶🌶
Aldus Larian (Jess): I put bralette underneath so no nipslip
Aldus Larian (Jess): Too much spicy in this channel tonight 🌶
Bill: *yes really*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Whoozica and Wezrez spicys? Must secure a spot in Aurii for access 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's ok my silly face distracts from the spicy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): L
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Clear the spicy with meme pictures
Bill: the point of the channel is for spice.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I just wanted to share that extremely out of character photo tbh lmaooooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): memes are spicy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Who was down for my ~~Hewwo~~ Hero academia for CCE anyways?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): David mentioned he wanted to be froppy
Bill: You Marisa Rebecca.
Bill: Maybe Anna.
Bill: That was really it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mawisa doin Iida, rebecca doin Bakugo, Anna thinkin present mic which probably means mag Ozawa
Bill: Erik doesn't feel Ochako genderbend and doesn't want to get paired with Rebecca.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OOF what a mood
Bill: Leanna would only want to do Bakugo, and is awkward about the dups.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm honestly strongly considering Ms. Joke
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah fuk it duplicates are always good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O ya tbh 🤔🤔🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Then you’d match Anna and Mag already so rebecca probably wouldn’t feel like switching lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): It to early to plan CCE for me
Bill: *Mag may jump you depending how drunk she is, but that's not a bad thing*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mood, I’m only planning it cause I’m swimsuit obsessed, this new wiggy is nicu, and CCE is my only confirmed definite con after Zenkai
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh shit same
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *and so far away*
Bill: ~~ota?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean I'm also swimsuit obsessed
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I'm stressed enough rn
Aldus Larian (Jess): I still have nothing for sat afternoon at zenkai <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Nejire.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I thought u we're doing pilot boi
Bill: I can switch.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~plus that's like half of sat and all Sunday in a long wig~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Not that that's a real big deal but ye
Bill: I probably will switch, pilot boi has actual leather chaps and that'll get annoying as fuck.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@351785752197201920>  do u wanna do tamaki on Saturday after 9s?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WOO MATCHIN JUSTIN AND ME
Bill: Todoroki and Bakugo are *literally* the furthest from the big three in canon. 😅
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Same series tho, that already makes me excited
Aldus Larian (Jess): It doesn't matter it's the same series
Bill: *It's basically Jumin and Ray.*
Bill: But I digress.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Ray has mad hidden respect for Jumin~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): At least in BNHA they all in same room tho
Bill: Ye.
Bill: It's a group.
Bill: Not like we'd be shootin it.
Bill: well, if we get big three maybe I could ask Flora to shoot that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom said he can tamaki
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hooray my hewwo acadootnoots
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dis I thought u said u wanted to rwby?
Bill: So big three after Rwby?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye u said u wanted to rwby in the afternoon/night
Bill: Nah, in the morning.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo ok
Bill: So it'd be like... Pilot boi 11 to 3 or 4, switch to Mirio.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👌 we'll see how long I survive in 2b
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm prob need to eat after boudoir so I don't bloat
Bill: ye we can pick up the formal people after doing boudoir and eat.
Bill: Something.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i recommend food
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hopefully Tom will still have enough energy
Bill: uber eats!
Bill: I didn't mind that at all for Katsu tbh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean I guess if Tom eats, and then I don't eat till after that could work
Aldus Larian (Jess): What time is the formal?
Bill: 8-10.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok so we slip Tom coffee at 7:00
Bill: I figure place the order when we start the shoot,  then by the time we done, food.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea but I don't wanna be like worried about having to stop to go down and pick up food ya know?
Bill: I can pick it up, but yeah I know what you mean.
Bill: Or we can send... ~~shit no Dave~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): stroll up to pick up your food in boudoir attire
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: Oh, were you volunteering to do that?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'd be terrified
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'd have to be mad drunk
Aldus Larian (Jess): So no
Bill: If you were that drunk I wouldn't let you go anyway XD
Bill: ~~you'd puke on the food before it makes it back to the room~~
Bill: Alcohol poisoning'll do that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WuUUut nahhh
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's ok I have 8 bags of honey butter chips to eat
N🆗ri (Marisa): make sure you take out your contacts
Aldus Larian (Jess): I always take out my contacts <:swag:555586684939665421>
