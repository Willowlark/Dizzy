Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think my reacts sum up that conversation perfectly
Bill: Did anyone catch this? Sakimi's tutorial for the month is how to intentionally inflate da tit.
Bill: ~~intentionally she says~~
Nokri (Marisa): that also slims the shoulders and widens the hips
Nokri (Marisa): thins the waist also
Nokri (Marisa): she's just panderin'
Aldus Larian (Jess): I love how they get higher as the get bigger, cuz that's how gravity works
Nokri (Marisa): exactly how gravity works. the more air in the chest the more it floats.
Nokri (Marisa): example A
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHH
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant wait till my boobs get bigger and my abs get more defined as a result too
Nokri (Marisa): example B
Nokri (Marisa): sadly the ab definition only works in fighting games, but your waist will get thinner!
Nokri (Marisa): in example C here, she must physically hold her chest down or else it will carry her into the sky
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn i had the opposite problem i lost almost a whole cup size when i lost weight.
Aldus Larian (Jess): when does the anime effect kick in?
Nokri (Marisa): that's weird. did you try rebooting it or changing the settings
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah i think the issues hardwired
