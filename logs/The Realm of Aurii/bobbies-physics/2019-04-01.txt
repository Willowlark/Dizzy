N🆗ri (Marisa): mojojo's poses are impossible irl thus it can be discerned that mojojo is not human
Bill: Or doesn’t know how human bodies work.
Bill: A common thing among otaku.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sakimi and mojojo both alien: confirmed.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): WOW SO KAWAII O3O
Bill: > Leanna sees Mawisa Blake
> stands up 
> rips open shirt
> bee lingerie
> opens desk drawer

N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m tryna get the other pictures done but this keyboard won’t go away <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
OH THERE IT Tno it’s back
N🆗ri (Marisa): We can all be kawaii through the power of apps and photoshop
Bill: You’re always Kawaii. Source is me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): APA style citations or bust
N🆗ri (Marisa): oki i got rid of the screen!
am considering posting in bne but i'd post a censored version with a sticker like i was planning to for social media. or i have a cat doll censor.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Like this after photoshopping everything but even that is <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): *am wearing 2 pairs of tights and a fake chest i have so much clothes on
N🆗ri (Marisa): each pic i upload costs you all $10,000
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i only have 2 cents and some pocket lint
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): will that suffice?
N🆗ri (Marisa): what color is the lint
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): red
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok that's a good lint color. not common like black or white.
Aldus Larian (Jess): u look adorable
N🆗ri (Marisa): I tried to imitate ur mystic mess shoot
Bill: wait, you want to censor more or less?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You look great 👌 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): o the censor would be about that much. maybe more.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i erased the stuff in the background and now the wall is blurry and splotchy <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): OwO
Bill: You look really good tbh, I don't think you have to do too much to it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotta look more like whatshisname
N🆗ri (Marisa): steve buscemi
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): You look amazing!
N🆗ri (Marisa): you may not like it but this is peak human physique
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa u looks great, and nothing like steve buscemi, which is a great thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): arigato swolfy that is the highest praise in all the kingdoms for all of eternity i'm gonna print everyone's compliments and frame them in gold
N🆗ri (Marisa): steve is the ideal
Glonk: 👍
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have the mojojo pose but. not the same as the art
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats ok tho! u dont have to be the same, plus u had the idea before u saw the art
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg could i sue him for copyright infringement
Bill: Do it but also don't cause his art is cute as fuck.
N🆗ri (Marisa): both good points
Aldus Larian (Jess): his art is cute but its super repetitive
N🆗ri (Marisa): t r u
N🆗ri (Marisa): probably draws what's easier for him over and over
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont even like "see" it anymore
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye, im hella tired of his art....until he does new stuff then im like  <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: it is, absolutely.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im just "oh another rwby girl in a "cute" outfit"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea basically
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mild variations of the same art
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): over and over
Bill: But cute girls in cute outfits.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i aint gay enough for this
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i guess? but a lot of artists do that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but like
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I'm not a fan of his cuz of the repetitiveness
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....in different poses and stuff to make it interesting
N🆗ri (Marisa): too much that's too similar
it's good he churns out a lot, like one every day or two, but they all look the same <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): no need for originality when u can just draw the same thing over and over again and still have fans
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *mojo do the bous plz*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mojo be like: what is.... boi
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): valid lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): srsly....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaaaaa oof
Bill: He *does* need to do the bois.
N🆗ri (Marisa): "rwby girls....... in boi clothes!!!! an open shirt and lingerie! yes. yes i do this boi request."
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~although the Penny/Peni one was cute~~
Bill: ~~open shirt and lingerie sounds great tho~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that one i was like :DDDDDDDDDDD
Bill: He's done them a few times, but only as backdrops.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but then he goes back to the same repetitive stuff
Bill: The anthologies don't have him drawing them either.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Most artists: what is boi
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and im like  :c
Bill: I got really sick of the swimsuits last summer though.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaaaaa
Bill: I think he did one for *every* character.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pls no more swimsuits
Bill: Like, I enjoy the variety of outfits.
N🆗ri (Marisa): swimsuit shadow background character when
Bill: But *every* character doesn't need a swimsuit.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it was cute at first
N🆗ri (Marisa): can penny even go in water
Aldus Larian (Jess): i get sick of like everything after the 3rd one XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): same
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ...sometimes after just 2
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like the virgin killer sweaters
Aldus Larian (Jess): and i feel like he repeats himself? like everyspring is bunny girls
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oof yea i dont like the bunny girls at all
Bill: I am not sure if half his posts are reblogs.
Bill: tbh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ohh yea that prob it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): please stop making bunny girls with like one visual difference from the last set
Bill: There are SO many that I can't tell what he drew and what he didn't.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he made new ones.... where he literally just like... changed the poses slightly and added bracelets
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and was like  😄 BUNNYS! ..as if we never saw it before
Bill: I don't know if I even recognized them as different.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): when he posted them i double checked because i thought i was going crazy
Bill: Be nice if he broke out of the theme sets.
Bill: Just casual clothes would be good.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeaaa
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): do like...scenes
Bill: But I guess he not a clothing designer.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): put the girls together
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh dang i found a good shot but i wasn't posed and just fixing the chest <:rip:369476083248267274>
can i replace my face with another face

yeah!!! i thought they were the same bunny ones from last year but the front is ever so slightly different
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): in casual clothes
N🆗ri (Marisa): he should take bunny outfit references from homestuck bunnies. they were so varied.
Bill: Like, I'd be on board to shoot Mojo bingo, but like...
Bill: That only works cause RWBY is a black hole and all variants are valid.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YOUR FACE IS GOOD STOP
N🆗ri (Marisa): it from before erik had the good collar idea that didn't work out
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk what to post <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ALL
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): post all
Aldus Larian (Jess): all
Bill: Yeah cute!
Bill: ~~so cute I had to open on my phone lest anyone else see at Armonk~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~you seriously look amazing i wish you had more confidence in yourself , you are perfect and amazing and also damn gurl~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): cease the emoji and praise i need harsh critique
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess writing a poem about herself 💕 exquisite
N🆗ri (Marisa): i tried to make the emoji say nya but that works too
N🆗ri (Marisa): we're gonna make a fake bust revolution
N🆗ri (Marisa): hand 'em out like candy
Bill: What do you want critique on?
N🆗ri (Marisa): everything about the photos and my entire life itself
Bill: You’re trying to do a self shoot, I’m not going to nitpick them.
Bill: Oh your LIFE?
Bill: WELL
Bill: You’re wonderful and perfect.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ~~The fake bust isn't why you look good thoooo~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~lowkey curious how it looks without the fake bobbies?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i balanced my phone on 3 dolls and then moved it to the bookshelf when that kept falling, and had it on selfie video mode then just took screenshots of the video
it is the highest quality film can capture
N🆗ri (Marisa): flat! <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): basically my rin shoot which i had a professional makeup artist for
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's the cat doll then that's the key
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no its definitely you
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's perfect365 <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO ITS YOU
Elfriede Faun (Tom): (x)**doubt**
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nope, its genuine cute Marisa.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes Mawisa is perfect 365 days of the year
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't find my rin pics <:hmm:543194383885926403> i know there's one on insta though
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm gonna cosplay steve buscemi next
Elfriede Faun (Tom): DOIT
Bill: The photos are obviously a little rough, to be critical but that's understandable. Your use of the cat doll is cute and really adds to the photos, you have the outfit down pat, and your posing is cat like and cutest.
Bill: 10/10 could open a patreon.
Bill: tldr you did *good*.
Bill: Remember, I don't lie.
Bill: So I literally can't say you're doing poorly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): THAT'S THE STUFF WOO
ye i bought the cat doll at katsucon like 3 years ago but never really used it
i considered making the leg and arm stuff last night but. nah.
y'know, nyah.
next time maybe i set up the gopro and that can get better quality, but that i wouldn't be able to see. i had the phone on video selfie mode so i could see it when i had my glasses on and so i didn't need to adjust it for the timer
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank u for critique 🙏
Bill: *how strange, Marisa accepting compliments*
Bill: The doll is a good accent piece.
N🆗ri (Marisa): if there was a complement there i skipped over it to get to the harsh stuff
Bill: Go pro will likely be worse quality tbh.
Bill: ~~go pros are kinda unimpressive if you don't need a waterproof camera~~
Bill: You just need someone actually behind the camera. Liiiiike after Kogara at slumba parti. 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): blake and jade have the same wig with just different colored ears 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): gopros are fun for running around too, **high speed cosplay nyooms**
Bill: Marisa curls up on Tom and Jess's bed in some kind of Jumin Han fantasy like.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is she cosplaying Elizabeth
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's time
Bill: shit if you got the white set you could have cosplayed Elizabeth the third.
N🆗ri (Marisa): white set is like $3
N🆗ri (Marisa): i tried to get a picture of elizabeth curled up but
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): O H
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): EXCUSE ME WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's the queen omg don't be so rude
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Art
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh wow it gets better
N🆗ri (Marisa): look you can buy it as a pillow
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): um
N🆗ri (Marisa): or some nice stationary
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): do they have
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dakimakura
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): asking for a friend
Aldus Larian (Jess): OmGgFgGf
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***now you're thinkin'*** <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm fucking dying 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im trying not to burst out laughing but I'm pretty sure it just sounds like crying
N🆗ri (Marisa): no sadly but they have multiple towel sizes and a nice travel bag
Bill: Dakimakura with live tentacle action. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): arrive at the beach
put on the lotion
spread out the towel
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): beach trip anyone?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bring our dakimakuras and beach towels
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): do they have..... beach chairs 👀
Bill: *are the arms of the chair made from his mouth tentacles*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): absolutely
N🆗ri (Marisa): closest is this duvet cover
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): .....wow ok i need that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): boudoir here i come
N🆗ri (Marisa): imagine the great night of sleep you'll have after
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Marisa have you done black Rock shooter?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I feel like you have but I can't find a record of it
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo the cosplay? no :0
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm insane then 👌  we good
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like dead master's outfit better than bts <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Zeikani did, and Georgia was going to as a kid but never finished the cosplay.
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia why u give up
N🆗ri (Marisa): never give up
Bill: ~~yo though I can easily bring flash gear to Tom and Jess's after Kogara, I'll toss in trunk if anyone wants to bullshit inside photos/actually be lewd~~
Bill: Could even bring the backdrop.
Bill: *Could use the basement and make it REAL dungeon porn*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NO NOT BASEMENT
Bill: 😛
Aldus Larian (Jess): not basement
Aldus Larian (Jess): u can use the bedroom but the background will be anime bois and gurls
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ye!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hope fashion lotor and 797 don't ruin the mood
Bill: Backdrop setup can block that out maybe.
Bill: ~~but what about boudoir on that old yellow topped pool table, right as the table breaks and kills the model~~
Bill: (kidding of course)
Aldus Larian (Jess): to bad its covered in boxes
Bill: Guess it's gotta be Ash's house.
Bill: ~~weird mood, fallout boudoir on a pool table feels like it would work?~~
Bill: No one is doing that but.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh yeah it would
Bill: Fallout would also be very 'pinup' in style, which isn't really anyone's taste here.
N🆗ri (Marisa): cinnamon is a good taste
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): once summer hits im back on my vintage bullshit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): speak for yourself
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WOO CINNAMON TOO
Bill: I'm confused.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cinnamon???? where did cinnamon come in xD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like cinnabon? can be do cinnabon boudoir?
N🆗ri (Marisa): good taste <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wear vintage stuff sometimes , not as much as leanna but i def like it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Bill: Where'd the connection from fallout boudoir to vintage clothing come from though.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "pinup"
Bill: Cinnabon boudoir would be messy.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHATD THE CONNECTION BETWEEN VINTAGE AND FALLOUT
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): also that
Bill: NO I MEAN UGH
Bill: Like yes vintage is fallout, but vintage clothes and a pinup boudoir shoot are not the same thing.
Bill: pinup is a photographic/modelling style.
Aldus Larian (Jess): im so confused
N🆗ri (Marisa): sinnamon
Bill: moot point, pool table covered in boxes and no one is doing fallout boudoir.,
Aldus Larian (Jess): for the record i like pinup style modeling/photography <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: tis not bad. Just designed for da sexy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well ya
Bill: ye old patreon shoots
Aldus Larian (Jess): pinup is like classic sexy tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): and can def be done with no exposed parts
N🆗ri (Marisa): spicy like this
N🆗ri (Marisa): good thing we're in nsfw
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): omg look at those bare *wrists* 😍
Bill: yup. Pinup is totally different than "patreon" sets.
N🆗ri (Marisa): those *ankles*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i need a fan
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my nose started bleeding
Aldus Larian (Jess): my nose is literally bleeding!
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh wait i think it stopped now
Bill: Jess's Kinsey Scale +=1
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): stuff that's essentially a swimsuit isn't too lewd for insta right
Aldus Larian (Jess): nope
Bill: Nah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): go go go post post
N🆗ri (Marisa): my wall's just really messed up lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: Your Facebook wall?
N🆗ri (Marisa): no the wall behind me that i shopped everything out of
Bill: Oh. Well I didn’t notice so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a bunch of random paintings over the bed i erased from all the pictures because they're one of a kind
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it really doesnt look bad unless you look real close
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea no ones gonna be focused on that
Bill: I think you’ve got artist’s ocd, it’s not going to be noticeable to anyone who didn’t see it before.
N🆗ri (Marisa): painted by my grandmother and of all things i don't want someone going "oh hey that's fran's art! fran did you see that"
N🆗ri (Marisa): spufflez posts bikini stuff so this should be fine right
i'm anxious of losing all my good followers <:rip:369476083248267274>
i can post this on twitter for my japanese rwby followers they'd love it, and twitter has a nsfw tag also to hide it
Aldus Larian (Jess): POST POST
Bill: POST
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): POST
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): POST
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): POST
Elfriede Faun (Tom): POST
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you can add a buffer photo before it on Insta
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was gonna use the first selfie, is that too lewd of a buffer
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm probably not gonna post this one even though i added the emblem. this is the true platinum tier patreon reward
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): or should i? ???? idk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): das cute tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk what's too over the line
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i really like that one tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you look hella cute, and the emblem is a good addition
N🆗ri (Marisa): then maybe i throw in
Bill: I’ve seen worse on insta it find.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you can do what that cute Aussie girl does by adding a derpy photo at the end
N🆗ri (Marisa): aretsyrut I DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE SHOOT
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a picture of papyrus from undertale
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): is there a tag i should tag this as to shield the children
Bill: No?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): #Perfect #amazing #blek
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Children will be like, woah can't look at that, too perfect, too pure
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i can't steal your tags tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just tag anything cosplay girl and you win the internet
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Posting a neet prop?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): BOOM
Elfriede Faun (Tom): cosplay girl
Bill: true tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yikes the cosplaygirl tag is way lewder
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think?
Bill: it tends to be.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's not even a lewd tag. it's just a tag that a lot of female cosplayers add regardless
Bill: yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): [goes into the cosplaygirl tag] where the bois at
Bill: But it's a general trend. r/cosplay has less lewd than r/cosplaygirls. Because. Whoever's in the tag/subreddit is looking for specifically girls.
N🆗ri (Marisa): r/cosplay is weird subreddit
N🆗ri (Marisa): except this gem
https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplay/comments/b7wlzp/self_spiderverse_kingpin/
N🆗ri (Marisa): like where all the cosplay tutorials
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that kingpin is incredible
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I forgot I had a Reddit account
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it looks awkward because the legs are so long compared to the torso, but otherwise it's really cool. the detail on the face is incredible
