Nokri (Marisa): how to tell when manga is written by a guy
Aldus Larian (Jess): what thaaaa
Nokri (Marisa): you know, that happens all the time. accidentally taking off your underwear while changing after gym class and then not noticing the entire time you're walking back to class in a skirt
Nokri (Marisa): well i guess this is a horror manga. maybe that's meant to be scary.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Manga was a mistake
