Bill: I wasnâ€™t really into Uraraka but DAMN girl.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That design is pretty sweet tbh
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): The long tail In the back
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hmm
Bill: The lewd preview is *quality* too.
Bill: I think Sakimi fucked Up, thereâ€™s the nude with censors, that one, and another one of this and itâ€™s supposed to be something different.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Completely separately from her that bra deisgn is pretty sweet, I wonder if she copied it from anything or designed it herself
Bill: Ditto. The detail is why I like the lingerie ones so much more than the actual nudes.
Bill: My background is definitely changing in the new year, but I dunno to who now.
Bill: Yang was top contender but Uraraka be attractive.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's cute, doesn't really look like her to me tho
Bill: Itâ€™s titled older, if that helps.
Bill: Obviously doesnâ€™t look canon, but mid 20s Uraraka? Iâ€™d believe it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ðŸ¤·
