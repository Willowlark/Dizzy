Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): First tho What is this
Bill: A sin.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Got a call I have to go work while doing this eyy
Speed de cosplay go
N🆗ri (Marisa): De cosplay is a success regular clothes acquired
Bill: Fake chest not comically large.
Bill: Also ye. Seems like the top blends right into the bra.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooh cute
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye!! That’s why it was neat they’re both black
It’s huge it looks hilarious from the side
Is this how girls feel wow poor girls
Aldus Larian (Jess): it amtches your skin tone well
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!! There were three types, they also had muscle suits for guys. I got the palest but irl it’s a liiiitle off shade
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I was commenting on the outfit btw, not the bobbies
N🆗ri (Marisa): I wanna use it to make a mold to mass produce them and we can all be hot
Bill: It’d probably be good with the white version too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah! I only have season one though rip
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes, I need bobbies for Red Riot Thot
N🆗ri (Marisa): Without the chest there is nothing. Flat as an unused notebook
Pls yes I think that would really tie the whole outfit together, even though it’s extremely well coordinated now
N🆗ri (Marisa): Eiken cosplay group when
Bill: I mean. The white version of the lingerie.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Fake bobbies look real enough 🤔
Bill: There’s no season to cat lingerie.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We were beaten to the punch
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooooooooo yeah I saw fan art of that the other day with the white set
Bill: Was never a huge fan of the set alone, but adding the outfit pieces on it make a lot cuter. Smart Mawisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Putting the weeb fan in fan service
Bill: Um sure.
Glonk: Sign me up for some bobbies
N🆗ri (Marisa): As long as you aren’t allergic to latex <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Glonk: <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): November 1st. We buy all the latex. We mass produce bobs. We get rich AND lots of stalkery guy followers who we hire bodyguards to fend off.
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): I'll take one bob pls
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Does work well with blek
N🆗ri (Marisa): Swolfy I’ll give one to you and one to your dog as thanks
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why y'all all show up as soon as theres boobs?
Glonk: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): We'd make a complete set. 👌
Elfriede Faun (Tom): "Y'all see Marisa" **Everyone whips out phone.**
N🆗ri (Marisa): No visible face what if it’s not even me <:pew:543202259085950996>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): IT U
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I see that mlp drago
N🆗ri (Marisa): I took a selfie but the chest fabric is spilling out over the top. It does that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Doxxed by the many pony posters <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: > Blake and Yang, getting sexy
> Blake: “hold on babe”
> Takes off tail coat
> takes off shirt
> puts tail coat back on 
> Yang doesn’t care still hot
N🆗ri (Marisa): THE SHIRT WOULDNT FIT OVER THE CHEST
N🆗ri (Marisa): I TRIED
N🆗ri (Marisa): I REALLY DID
N🆗ri (Marisa): o magic selfie filters. turn me anime.
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/TZwakVM.png
Bill: !lewd
N🆗ri (Marisa): valid
Bill: Put that on your patreon.
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is how we fund aurii irl this is how we get the money to make aurii a real country
N🆗ri (Marisa): leanna is the beexpert but until she gives her official PhD opinion i'm gonna clean up
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Sasuke-kun keeping us safe at work
Elfriede Faun (Tom): In.. the nsfw channel
N🆗ri (Marisa): not all heroes wear capes
Aldus Larian (Jess): The NSFW channel, that we all open at work anyway
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEET
Bill: Actually knowing Mawisa was posting LEWDS I’ve been replying on my phone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well there's a sentence I never thought would exist
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it lewd if i've worn skimpier cosplays though
N🆗ri (Marisa): everything is fully covered
N🆗ri (Marisa): with the shorts it's got more coverage than nowi
Bill: You going to run with it that way?
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> ?
Bill: For the shoot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): O sure if everyone is ok with it. I can replace the pants with a skirt or leave them out altogether
Bill: I think it's whatever *you're* okay with lol.
Bill: Goes back to what kind of shoot do you/Leanna want? Tittilatingly spicy, intimate, patreon fuel...
N🆗ri (Marisa): <—- very little sense of what is lewd and doesn’t want to make others uncomfortable
I know the one girl at the Dangan Ronpa shoot was lewd when she purposefully raised her skirt and had a thong on outside at a public shoot. Mainly because she was exposing it to people who probably didn’t want to see it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bees. Just release bees into the room
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): COUPLES SOFTCORE BOUDOIR?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof I just thought of something...
Bill: Someone get a Nick Cage cosplay.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ...potentially not great...
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg yeah it can double as a homestuck lewd
Bill: You wanna just let Leanna decide the tone?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Leanna doing a bee shoot with someone that's not Wish...*
Bill: OH THATs Oh.
Bill: oof.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can do that if she wants, otherwise I can pitch pose ideas 
Is wish gonna kill me because I was thinking of that earlier during tea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But that's honestly Wish's problem. Leanna is allowed to do bees with whomstever she wants
Bill: Well, she don't follow Mawisa (probably) and Leanna don't have to post till things calm down.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): valid
Bill: Yup, Bees are for whoever you want to pollinate with.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Yes Georgia, all the boudoir ever discussed is softcore spicy boudoir.
N🆗ri (Marisa): My work just arrived but I can read while working it’s just mindless movement so I can see stuff posted but may be slow typing
Bill: ~~are we getting Renora or what cause Dish did the bed lewd and 👌 ~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): youll have to ask the other half about that
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> strip for us
Bill: ~~I don't treat the genders differently no, why do you ask~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): biru das gay
Aldus Larian (Jess): but he is beautiful
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Kay
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@301927856240459777> was that the katsu shoot?
Aldus Larian (Jess): babe dont say kay unless you mean it youll get billiams hopes up
Bill: Yes.
Bill: There is nothing I want more than to see Tom's sweet, sweet man nips.
Bill: 🌶
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean you were disappointed last time it didnt happen so
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Pffft
Bill: ~~yes but my disappointment wouldn't be the reason to do it in the first place~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): whaa?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Katsu shoot? :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH the planned Katsu boudoir? Naw nowi was a costume I publicly wore
Bill: It's FE Nowi Tomu!
Bill: I mean I'm not the reason he should be serious about saying kay. Well. I guess I am. Saying Kay and blowing off whatever time I end up finding for the shoot is kinda oof.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dis nowi
Aldus Larian (Jess): in his defense he didnt have a wog so
Bill: ye I'm not saying Katsu was that or anything.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Also Blake’s arm things can be used for tying
the wig incident was really funny not gonna lie
Bill: *For someone who says she doesn't know lewd stuff she's suggesting some lewd stuff*
Bill: 😛
Aldus Larian (Jess): NICE
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nononi
N🆗ri (Marisa): You are all horrible influences and I have read a lot of shoujo manga
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The dangaranpon flasher
Bill: *Man I don't even get into my influences*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooooooo yeah. I have pictures if people wanna see that later, but I tried not to get it in the picture. 
I have to do the meet up pictures still
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh wow
Aldus Larian (Jess): man i wanna do those cute soft boudoir things but im so scared of posting and my religious friends and fam seeing
Bill: Thematically it should be Blake tied up cause like 'you aren't running away anymore' but like. How'd she manage to get tied up her own ribbon.
Aldus Larian (Jess): and just scared overall
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I know who nowi is 🙌
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I promise
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah I don’t think my sister checks insta but I know the one time she does 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): she managed because it was CONSENSUAL
Bill: I mean yes, of course, but like. her ribbon. That's usually wrapped around her.
Bill: > Do pictures
> Get pictures back
> Get drunk at some point
> Drunkly post lewds
> Don't have to worry about the fallout till sober
Bill: Easy.
Bill: Or do a pun lewd account.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well you see, you remove riboon from girl then you ask for permission and then you use ribbon to tie
Bill: Boobzica.
Aldus Larian (Jess): THAT SOUNDS EVEN MORE TERRIFYING
N🆗ri (Marisa): Stuff happens. I was reading a manga where two weee characters facing away from each other several feet apart, one sitting and one standing. When the sitting one stood up (FACING AWAY FROM THE OTHER) they wound up in the awkward splayed on the group trope pose
Bill: oh then don't do that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Erik wound up in chains for his beedoir
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I sure did
Aldus Larian (Jess): my boobs arent big enough to be boobzica anyway
N🆗ri (Marisa): Take The Chest
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lewdzica
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Oof had another idea but it not good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ???
Bill: For a lewd nickname.
Aldus Larian (Jess): tell
Bill: *Whoozicunt*
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHHHHHHHHHHH lmao
Bill: Souuuuuunds way more like an insult than a nickname.
Bill: But the works combined well.
Aldus Larian (Jess): "that girl you slept with- whoozicunt"
Aldus Larian (Jess): like whatshername but meaner
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i finally caught up damn
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~if i drink im comfy with anything~~ so....maybe we should get some like reference photos xD
Bill: What kinda of photos do you want is the question then.
Bill: What's the *mood* or *theme* or other bullshit art words.
Bill: also https://www.pinterest.com/willow_lark/boudoir/
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): less ridiculous spice and more like... soft
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~sure are a lot of feet in this~~ 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh wait
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): where am i
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO

Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THERE WERENT FEET I JUST ENDED UP IN FEET FETISH TERRITORY
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sjklafhsjklfhsdl
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im fucking laughing so hard im crying
Bill: Oh okay.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont know how i got there
Bill: I was gonna say I don’t have a foot fetish.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i was scared because i opened the link and it was like boudoir... but with random feet with like foot thongs
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i was like
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THIS IS NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *foot thongs?*
Bill: I’m terrified.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like thats the best way to describe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it literally looked like a lacey thong
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): on a foot
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I looked up foot thong
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): surprisingly, the majority of the results are actually legitimate footwear
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): for dancers
Elfriede Faun (Tom): LMAOOO
