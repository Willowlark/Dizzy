No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): THERES A PLOT REASON
IVE BLOCKED ALL TBIS FROM NY NEMORY ITS TOO LEWD BUT THERES A REASON FOR IT how could you bring this back up after I’ve forgotten it. Are you reading FFAK?

Dylan was dying and wanted Crimson to kill her but crimson (that is crimson right? I think?) took pity on her and wanted to save her so they did dirty stuff and crimson had to be like “hey ur a surgeon right? Hypothetically how would I sew someone’s back back together and save their life” and Dylan is like ew why and crimson is like “it turns me on just tell me how to do it” and has to fix her up while pretending surgical jargon is hot
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): I get desperate when I have nothing else to read and Nasty Red Dogs was really good when it started and so I began ffak to bide time until nasty red dogs updated <:lenny:395307171539189760>
No pain, Nokri, No game (Marisa): i love paper
I do what I want(tm): Wowweee
