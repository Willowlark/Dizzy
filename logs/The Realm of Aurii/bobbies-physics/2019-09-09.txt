Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I laughed way too hard at bambiiski's "budget Belle Delphine" Insta story ðŸ˜‚
Bill: *Jesus* that's some kinda cut. And this is a school scantioned outfit.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's inappropriate for school attire. Her shoulders are n't covered
Bill: Yes, that's the problem with it. Everything else is a okay. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): who even is that
Bill: Edelgard!
Nokri (Marisa): that bottom cut is too low
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): maybe they do the Disneyâ„¢ thing and wear a skin-colored bodysuit under it so their shoulders are covered
Bill: That's what we were actually referring to, yes.
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): o i just posted it to show the fanart was inaccurate
Nokri (Marisa): thought was middle one was dimitri rip
Bill: Don't worry, Dancer is now equal opportunity.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: 
Bill: Claude owns Dancer, actually.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 1 leggy is equal opportunity?
Bill: You want them to dance for you or not. :3
Nokri (Marisa): equal opportunity but not truly equal clothes
Bill: 
Bill: I'm not a huge fan of the female dancer outfit myself, but ya know.
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: https://twitter.com/0vv0b/status/1163012752413057024?s=19 there you go someone edited models to show some chest
Nokri (Marisa): i had tea with hanneman for the first time yesterday and he sits so weirdly
Nokri (Marisa): it's not about the chest and showing skin it's just about making the costumes even
Aldus Larian (Jess): is that a fan edit?
Bill: yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): then it dont sount
Bill: I'm not saying it
Bill: I'm not saying it 'counts' for anything, I just thought you'd want to see it. ðŸ˜’
Bill: sorry
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol i was just kidding fam
Aldus Larian (Jess): alls i was saying is that its not equality but it was all in good fun
Nokri (Marisa): ye! if the DLC made the outfits like that, then it's equality <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I'm not trying to argue anything with you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i-i wasnt arguing
Aldus Larian (Jess): either
Nokri (Marisa): i think jess was just commenting on how it's not equal if the 'skimpy' outfit is just fanart
Nokri (Marisa): people can make fanart of literally anything
Bill: I understand people can make fanart of whatever they want, and agree it's not equal. I didn't share it to 'count' as if it did. I shared it cause I thought you would want to see it as it's closer to what you would want.
Nokri (Marisa): no one's fighting or arguing anything <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Nope. It's fine.
Nokri (Marisa): that sounds really passive aggressive tho are you sure <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Bill: I just don't want to be more dramatic than I already am. Jess didn't mean anything, I'm just twitchy on trying to be understood correctly, especially since yesterday.
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe you'll see why that happens if I type like you.
Nokri (Marisa): This is hard.
