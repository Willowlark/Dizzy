Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _naughty pompom_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, I've seen those panties from VS that are literally just cut from whatever stretchy non-fraying fabric and sewn together with raw edges and I *know* those were probably expensive and could easily be recreated for so much less
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s not too frequent that I’m impressed with Victoria secret
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Their sports bras are really good for well endowed ladies
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They make super strong sports bras so nothing jiggles
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And it takes a bit of hunting to find the good panties, some of them are cheap and lame
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And bras I don’t buy there cause I get them for like 30 bucks on sale at Nordstrom
