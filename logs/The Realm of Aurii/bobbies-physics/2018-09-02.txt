Afina (Georgia🍀): So Hal got these nipple covers as part of that emergency fashion pack with the invisible straps I needed
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I'm staring at them like "how likely is a nip slip gonna happen at CCE"
Nokri (Marisa): Never hurts to wear? 🤷
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll probably pack them
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like I'm PROBABLY overestimating the chances
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I'd rather be safe than sorry
Nokri (Marisa): Ye that’s the best. Are they waterproof?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think so yeah!
Bill: Very overestimating. ~~someone just want to use em?~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>
