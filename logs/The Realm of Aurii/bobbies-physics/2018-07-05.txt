Aldus (Jess): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOH THAT SECOND ONE IS GOOD
Aldus (Jess): The tlines seem to be the same in both just lighter in the first one
Bill: 
Bill: Ironically, it seems that most artists just say fuck it and draw her normally.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _are those lines where a thong would be_
Afina (Georgia🍀): ***ROBO THONG?***
Aldus (Jess): Tell you what girl we'd make mad cash with a joint patreon 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): You bring the booty I'll bring the robo thong 😂
Aldus (Jess): 🙌
Bill: https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/post/show/6651077
Bill: ~~robo thong is canon~~
Aldus (Jess): Biru you didn't give the porn warning
Aldus (Jess): I'm guessing that's cuz you have ad blocker
Bill: It's in NSFW and yes.
Aldus (Jess): But sankaku has literal porn in the ads
Bill: Image wouldn't load on my phone, and I'm not opening sankaku on my work machine, allowed to personal things or not.
Bill: 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I can't see whatever it is on mobile somehow
Bill: Here’s a wholesome neko A2.
Bill: 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh my god
Bill: so it canon.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not doing it 😂
Aldus (Jess): Doooo itttt
Aldus (Jess): With the shorts
Bill: *obviously with the shorts*
Aldus (Jess): Lmfao what even
Bill: There's worse on Sankaku girl.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Someone: nice thong, me: THANKS ITS MY GIRLFRIENDS
Aldus (Jess): You think I don't know know that?
Aldus (Jess): I'm laughing at the glowing eyes and the weird setting
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's just a weird pic lok
Aldus (Jess): Yea exactly
Afina (Georgia🍀): Protocol: Booty Acquired
Aldus (Jess): Lmao let's recreate it
Aldus (Jess): See you say I'm brave but then you got girls like this
Aldus (Jess): That pic is extremely low quality whooos
Afina (Georgia🍀): _are your cheeks cold ma'am_
Aldus (Jess): Lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Alright I got some extrapolated android lines patterned out
Afina (Georgia🍀): Not all are visible but this is just conceptual for now
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: 
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH THOSE CANON?
Bill: Took them in the debug room.
Bill: so yes.
Aldus (Jess): Yea she technically doesn't get more naki than that I think
Aldus (Jess): Cuz she's not a person
Bill: That's after she uses self destruct, which destroys her top.
Aldus (Jess): ~~meaning she don't have privates but try telling that to all these pervs~~
Bill: ~~same to 2B~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh huh well my concept wasn't far off
Aldus (Jess): Yes and 9s and Adam and Eve and loteral everyone
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye Adam and Eve, confirmation, no dick
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like a Ken doll
Aldus (Jess): Try telling that to the fan artists
Bill: ~~Fanarts draw Adam and Eve~~?
Aldus (Jess): Sometimes
Aldus (Jess): Usually uhhhhhh with 9s
Aldus (Jess): All together
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): ANYWAYS here my lines
Aldus (Jess): Lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think I went a little gung ho but like, most are covered under clothes anyways, I just wanted to know where these lines connected dammit
Aldus (Jess): Whoooo!
Afina (Georgia🍀): I am literally gonna have to wear a full body pair of tights it'll be so fun t
Aldus (Jess): In da pool?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye in da pool, dance tights at least hold up in da pool
Afina (Georgia🍀): They'd be feetless too so they don't get scuffed up
Aldus (Jess): You go be a soggy girl?
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean bathing suits are soggy anyways
Aldus (Jess): Well yea
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tights won't be too bad, especially the dance kind
Aldus (Jess): But they aren't your whole body
Afina (Georgia🍀): Dat true
Aldus (Jess): But you'll be fine
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk I pray for evaporation to do it's duty on me lol
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: They going to be destroyed after the pool tho?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah, by what?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Water?
Aldus (Jess): Na they don't got feet's
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~look ma no feets~~
Aldus (Jess): As long as she uses fabric paint she should be fine
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEET!
Bill: Well, they also might lose strength in the water and rip? Idk.
Aldus (Jess): Not unless shes like rolling around on he floor
Afina (Georgia🍀): Well there goes THAT plan of rolling along the con floor lol
Aldus (Jess): Need to but like my 18th pair of thigh highs for 2b
Bill: Still, A2 during the day won’t be all water, then Marinette after for more swimming.
Aldus (Jess): Regular floor you could pool floor I wouldn't cuz the grippies will pull
Afina (Georgia🍀): I have shoes for pool and normal A2 already
Afina (Georgia🍀): My mom had some that were PERF
Afina (Georgia🍀): and I'll just use the black and white flip flops I already have for poo lA2
Bill: Yeah do that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Pool A2 is probably gonna look a whole lot like reg A2 anyways, just swapping out the swimsuit material
Afina (Georgia🍀): Unless I do the open sides thing which IS tempting
Bill: Your mom had what, 6 inch stellitos?
Bill: And the hesitation on that is support right?
Aldus (Jess): What shoes are you wearing in the pool?
Aldus (Jess): Oh NVM you answered yhat
Afina (Georgia🍀): What no I found some smol 1 inch heels for A2
Afina (Georgia🍀): _who do you think I am, ryan?_
Bill: Don’t you know Android all wear stupid high heels?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah fuck that 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): I learned my lesson with Pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): Comfort > Canon
Bill: Praise!
Aldus (Jess): where would you recommend i buy thigh highs from for pool 2b that would be somewhat durrable
Bill: Uh.... target? 😝
Aldus (Jess): i was asking georgia butt head
Bill: Hence the 😝 emoji baaaaka
Aldus (Jess): honestly the one i had from amazon were more durable than hanes brand but they didnt ahve the pretty top that stay up nice like hanes does
Bill: Go for the pretty ones?
Bill: They have to last a day basically.
Aldus (Jess): they god rip on that pool floor in like 10 seconds
Bill: Oh.
Bill: Foot pad things like Georgia has for Bug?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye!
Afina (Georgia🍀): And thigh highs anything primarily spandex/rayon is prob good
Afina (Georgia🍀): They're a little more hydrophobic than anything with cotton
Aldus (Jess): where can i get the foot pad thingies?
Aldus (Jess): imma wet test nora to make sure my nips dont show <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): That looks like a very 2B swimsuit damn
Bill: Ye that’s a high waist.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): This one is a fashion disaster but it's lookin pretty good for A2 tbh cause it has the same cut as her actual outfit but with open sides to show off them android lines
Bill: Yee.
Bill: “Woman’s sexy one piece”
Bill: Pfft.
Aldus (Jess): high hip not high waist
Bill: Right.
Aldus (Jess): ~~ i shit like the modified tankini for a2 js~~
Bill: ~~Ditto one piece doesn’t feel A2~~
Aldus (Jess): i also personally find that that style of one piece accentuates all the wrong things 😅
Aldus (Jess): ughhh i wanna work on nora but now the suit is wet
Aldus (Jess): oh nip coverage is good btw
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEET
Elfriede (Tom): ye technically A2 with the short hair is fully naked right?
Elfriede (Tom): shes an older model so she has some black parts
Afina (Georgia🍀): and yeah if I wanna go with android lines (I do, that's kinda signature, and A2 is easily recognized that way) I need to cover the vertical line that runs up the middle of the body
Bill: Which?
Elfriede (Tom): oh ye for the swimsuit you mean?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yee
Afina (Georgia🍀): So the swimsuit has to be a one piece or a monokini
Afina (Georgia🍀): _which is a stupid word_
Aldus (Jess): why not tankini?
Elfriede (Tom): MONOKINI
Elfriede (Tom): Princess monokini is my favorite studio ghibli film
Aldus (Jess): omg babe
Aldus (Jess): 😂
Bill: I don’t know what line that is, I don’t remember it.
Aldus (Jess): https://88bcfec21c205b1abd47-f5ae0e3e704fa6b24707960067360d1b.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/slimming-black-a__402832245__866802635_std.jpg
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tankini still shows midriff ye?
Aldus (Jess): ye
Bill: Ye, like what Jess linked.
Aldus (Jess): oh you dont wanna show it at all?
Aldus (Jess): like i was thinking you could take something like that and then cut it to be like her top is
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean I could probably get away with it
Bill: You could also keep the simple lines like those first two arts.
Bill: The arm and neck lines are the ones that define her, no one know about the lower body ones.
Aldus (Jess): ~~im still confuse why tummy bad? is it a comfort level thing or?~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): There would just be a straight up line from my crotch to my underboob
Aldus (Jess): like vertically up?
Elfriede (Tom): on your sides tho right?
Aldus (Jess): like through your belly button?
Elfriede (Tom): i dont think she has one dead center
Bill: She doesn’t.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye the tights do
Afina (Georgia🍀): I wonder if there's any pics of that line showing on Pyrrha but I don't think so
Bill: Oooooh, the TIGHTS. It’s not A2, it’s the seam of the tights.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also I was at the bottom of a mountain that's why I lost connection lol
Aldus (Jess): ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ok
Aldus (Jess): not i know what you mean XD
Bill: Ye fuck that drive. Did it for Grandma’s funeral.
Elfriede (Tom): OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Afina (Georgia🍀): _the mountain mommas obstructing my wifi_
Elfriede (Tom): THE MOUNTAIN MOMMAS OMG
Aldus (Jess): still you could show your sides and just make the middle a bit longer
Aldus (Jess): makye a smol peak of tum
Afina (Georgia🍀): On a tankini?
Aldus (Jess): yeet
Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably! I could just avoid bending most of the day, I do that in Pyrrha anyways lol
Aldus (Jess): i wouldnt worry about it too too much
Aldus (Jess): ill do my tan lines you do your tight line XD
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lmao yeah!
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll look and see if there's some tankinis I like that look like dat one
Bill: Yeah I wouldn’t worry. No one will care, and it won’t show up in photos.
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
