Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): THE REVIEWS ARE GOLD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ```COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF MANSCAPED:

There it was on my porch, a box that I knew to be the right size of what I was expecting. I opened the box to find it, The Lawn Mower 2.0. I open it up and the trimmer strikes me as impressively small. With it came two guards and a nice velvet bag, with a charger of course. I charge to maximum power, and get ready for the big day. 

I step into the shower with my manscaped. At first I’m hesitant that she’s waterproof, but indeed she is. I decide to first start on my happy trail, to warm her up a bit. I make my happy trail nice and straight, cleaning up the outsiders.

The time has come. I make a move to the pubic area. I start trimming and at first am incredibly underwhelmed. “This isn’t doing anything”, I thought to myself. Then I let the water splash me to see that manscaped had indeed “manscaped.”

What once was a forest was now a middle schoolers peach fuzz. “HOLY &$@& THAT WORKS”, he said.

Now was the time for the main fight card. I brace myself, say a prayer, and then me and my manscaped head towards my taint. I had fear on my mind. I start going to work, and in shocking disbelief, the lawn mower 2.0 left me unharmed, and at peace. It chopped away at my ass hair all with a devoted mission to keep me free of pulls, nicks, nacks, and attacks to my sack. 

I take a moment to let it all sink in. Manscape won’t offer you a clean shave that a razor will, but it will clean you up without a fear of that worst fear....clipping your balls.```
