Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol the first thing on the link look like pyrrha pjs
Bill: Tons of see through underwear and then:
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats my kinda boudoir
Aldus Larian (Jess): looks comf
Bill: Prob is.
Bill: ~~you decided on your boudoir outfit and it decidedly not that lol~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~can i add my Shrexy sweatshirt?~~
Bill: Wasn't this bees not memes.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Still not sure what mood you're looking for outta bees tho. ~~tldr am I pointing out things to do to be sexy or are ya'll just going to cuddle on a bed~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean, knowning me, it'll end up being memes
Bill: shit you right.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): or me just fucking cracking up between poses
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you have exactly 3 seconds to snap the shot before i burst out laughing, or dab
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~not actually, but ya know~~
Bill: still need to know what posing to suggest tho. Else we all just kinda stand/sit/lay there like 'uuuuh'
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is there like a middle ground between patreon and soft cuddle bees
Bill: I dunno but we can find it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): me and tom are going for like silly intimate
Aldus Larian (Jess): what kinda mood do u think fits da bees as a coupls?
Bill: I know exactly the mood for you guys. Like a fucking hanes commercial, the couple is half naked and running about flirting their way towards the bed and the commercial ends with a kiss on the lips.
Bill: The literal air around it gives people diabetes.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~as someone who like...rarely thinks about sexual situations, i never actually thought about how bees would be in that scenario~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bees are like so sweet, like honey <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): like dishwashers art on the bed is good mood
Bill: Yang: "Hey kitty cat lets see that-"
Blake: "If you finish that sentence I'm sleeping in JNPR's room"
Yang: "....Book."
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~hold on ill go read some fan fic for u real quick~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): with 2 asexuals doing boudoir i think we gonna need to group pool ideas
Bill: yes it. a challenge.
Bill: We'll all be around for it though.
Bill: Either thursday night or friday morning.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> hopefully thursday night so im justified in heavily drinking for this
Bill: We'll subscribe to the Tim school of Zenkai.
Bill: Be drunk at 9am.
Bill: I mostly want to get an estimate of the 'how lewd are you trying to look' o meter, because I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable saying 'more tit' or something like that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean, i think my outfit alone gauges that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but mostly im comfortable with like anything marisa is comf with
Bill: ~~Marisa has no idea so the two of you have no idea~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): RIP
Bill: Yolo we'll figure it out.
Bill: Will provide generic anime things to throw at me (NOT the camera) in case of discomfort to ease the mood.
Bill: Pose direction (generally) is never supposed to make some tense up.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is salt a generic anime thing
Bill: And discomfort will make someone tense up.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats my secret
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im always uncomfortable
Bill: in boudoir, that tenseness will show more obviously.
Bill: So by asking ahead of time, I can hopefully avoid that for better photos and a better time overall.
Bill: ~~or we all drink enough that there's nothing to be tense over...!~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ohhhh its prob relevent to say that my shoulders are crooked and my neck is tenser on the left side permanently, so we might need to work around that >.>
Bill: That fine. It means you know your "Good" side.
Bill: easy peasy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have a slight hunchback
Aldus Larian (Jess): so that might look awkward too
Bill: Naaah it’ll be good. Like I said, slong as you know what you consider your “bad” (again air quotes y’all beautiful) side we can keep it from being the “side” we shoot, or from taking a focus.
Bill: Also know what you like.
Bill: As in, if you got that killer ass, say that too cause that’s what we DO focus on. The parts that you’re proud of.
Bill: Doesn’t have to be a sexual bit either. Could be your ears. I suppose. Whatever makes you smirk “yeet I’m awesome” in the mirror.
Aldus Larian (Jess): this is pretty much what i have for MC already at home. 
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FFXLZWI/ref=twister_B01FFXLO88
Bill: ~~If I sound like I know what I’m talking about I just read a bunch of articles on google, I really, really don’t~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill wear different undies tho
Bill: Cute!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ohhh thats niceee
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think that fits her? i just gotta cover up nipnop
Bill: It does ye.
Bill: ~~But MC is also you so do you~~

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): lingerie shopping at work is whole new level of not giving a shit
Bill: 👌
Aldus Larian (Jess): finding a balance between enough booty and too much booty is hard
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no such thing as too much booty 😏
Aldus Larian (Jess): for pics there is D: i scared bean
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh valid
Bill: I mean... shrug? If there’s any shots with 100 booty you just don’t post them.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: Two ace girls doing boudoir sounds like a sitcom.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The 18+ dating game at zenkai is run by a team of aces <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Most of the 18+ events are I think
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): aces can have dirty minds, just no sexual attraction xD
Bill: All excellent episodes of Two Ace Girls Doing Boudoir.
Bill: Guest Starring Charlie Sheen.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YIKeS
Bill: That's literally it.
Bill: He shows up, 'yikes', door closes.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like Charlie Sheen would be more "I bet I can make you *not* ace"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yikes -locks 8 locks on door-
Bill: ^
