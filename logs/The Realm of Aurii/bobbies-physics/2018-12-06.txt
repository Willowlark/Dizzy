Bill: There's *alot* gay shit in Sakimi's recent release.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): gay or lesbean?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~or gay as in 2 characters that genuinely love each other~~
Bill: gay bois. All the women from this term are KDA league.
Bill: At least there was a preview which showed she's finally doing Yang this month.
Bill: NoctxPrompto, SidonxLink, kpop Bakugo.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh damn
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Is this fan fiction?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Art?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah art
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): too spicy for tumblr
Bill: Sakimi does pinup art.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): OH that person
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I heard they’re doing actual nude stuff now too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea shes sooper popular
Bill: I'm on the patreon because of the rwby ones.
Bill: She's always done actual nudes.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Whatever she’s done recently is spicier than whatever she’s done before
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): It was big talk the other day
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'm kinda becoming disappointed in her recent stuff
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): She keeps giving every character massive bewbs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea she made all the KDA boobies huge
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like akali has like B's
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): some of the man bodies have been a lil strange lately too
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): All wide shoulders and neck with 47 abs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea and like 900 of that side muscle
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oblique?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think i perfer the more clothed versions
Bill: I tend to.
Bill: skimpy is more attractive than the just 'B E W B S' of the nudes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh lol i meant dudes but yea that too XD
Bill: Change the sex organ.
Bill: Same thing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea theres too many abs for me sometimes but honestly i take what i can get
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its good quality and at least she mixes it up between ale and female characters
Bill: and the actual couple stuff is quality.
Bill: I love that stuff.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): all of the girl's bodies are kind of the same
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): the guys too kind of
Bill: Typically couple lewds are straight up *sex*, but some of Sakimi's still remain more... tasteful?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA the couples ones are good especially its something i actually ship lol
Bill: It's just nice having something that's not like, straight up porn.
Bill: I don't even ship it and it's just nice.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea finding stuff like that is really hard
Bill: well, correction. I ship it, what I know of those two is cute, I just don't care for league.
Bill: Noctis getting Luna and Prompto what a thot.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): SHIP THE FURRIES
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): xayah and Rakan are adorable ye
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And also those are thier actual bodies sizes
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Not triple boobs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WYD sakimi
Bill: If the goal is pinup style I guess that makes sense?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): mmm not really? i mean traditions pin ups have pretty average bobbies, something that could be achieved with a push up bra
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think shes just following a trend or something, which i get
Bill: logical evolution of the style maybeh?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): idk
Bill: *animification of the style*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🤷
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): based on the weird stuff i enjoy reading i can't kinkshame y'all. darn.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OwO
Bill: Did we even get into kinks?
Bill: Yang looks good. ~~Still disappointed by Weiss~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i have a big kink for couples that love each other
Bill: FUCK that's dirty I dig it.
Bill: Sex that's romantic in nature and really captures the love between two people.
Bill: I can't believe I'm talking about it in public.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): MOOD
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): anything nsfw is a kink right
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i have no kinks i have freaky manga
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~especially when the man is actually visible and not just a backround blue with no eyes~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm kind of mad at made in abyss tbh. i really love the story but it's getting gross with the loli porn.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😱
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's so wholly unnecessary too
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): nsfw is allowed in nsfw chat right
Bill: yeah.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): irumyuui straight up tells vueko "you smell like you sleep with a lot of people" and then pages later this montage happens
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): pretty sure all these girls are like, under 14
Bill: I mean, there was a line in the first episode that was high key questionable.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): what was that?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): poor riko has been shown in many very questionable and nude positions
oh was it the thing about being strung up naked as a punishment
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that's shown several times in the manga <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: Like, she's 12.
Bill: no.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): oh i forgot all the pages after that page show everybody dying of dysentery
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG 😱
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i think now that the series is a huge hit and the author can get away with doing more stuff because they're famous they put in more and more of it and if it keeps increasing i'm gonna drop the manga
Bill: it sounds like it's only been part of background scenes and montages so far?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea cuz thats BS as really depletes the quality
Bill: Never like, explicitly having a scene for it?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): kind of a bit? most is in the background or as bonuses. I bought the most recent volume and if you take off the dust jacket all the characters are nude. I block most of the bad content from my memory but there's a lot of toilet stuff too.
Bill: Interesting.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): which is ok as long as it's not sexualized like c'mon
Bill: I'm just comparing to Goblin Slayer which is straight up in your face with it's rape and gore.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): like i said, immediately after that picture above everyone is horribly sick
lemme see if i can find the riko part
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): o i haven't seen the anime yet how is that. is the anime super censored
Bill: Not at *all*.
Bill: There's a content disclaimer on it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i only watched the first episode
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh wait i think i saw 2 episodes
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): oo neato
maybe my autographed manga will sell for a lot at the charity auction now that people know of it
Bill: It gets better, much less rapey.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA cuz giant titty childhood friend was there
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): OH there's a tiny creature in made in abyss whose butt prolapses
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG MARISA NO
Bill: It really is a D&D party. Then they fight Tucker's Kobolds.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): shall i find it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NOI
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): oh gosh yeah. that's gross.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
Bill: ~~what happens to Mawisa when kinks are actually talked about~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i perish
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): all the words just blur out
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): in the middle of a full-blown conversation: "hey why is everyone so quiet?"
