Nokri (Marisa): the poor girl selling this at the con did such a good job that this was the only thing that caught people's attention when they went by her booth and she sold way less than usual because everyone was so focused on this
Nokri (Marisa): i think she took it down sunday due to a mix of complaints/not selling enough other merch
Aldus (Jess): Oh no! 😢
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Aldus (Jess): Lmfao
