N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): how did someone look at this and go "yeah girls will love it, put it on tv"
N🆗ri (Marisa): only acceptable thing for an english teacher to say tbh
Dirty Lego (Tom): OH
Dirty Lego (Tom): his butt placement is concerning
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Dirty Lego (Tom): there it is 👌
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Her face tho 👌 bigmood
N🆗ri (Marisa): my face when lewd chapters get published
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but then she like "it ok 👌 "
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah 👌
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and hes like "all good?"
Dirty Lego (Tom): They he cry
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): LIKE YES OK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS 👏
Dirty Lego (Tom): I wanna finish the anime but then iight read the whole manga
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): real talk.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): marisa, do you know naything about japenesse sex customs? i would assume its not an area of interest for you but just wondering
Bill: *I unfortunately win*
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
a tiiiiiny bit? very very little. i know about it in historical contexts and their viewpoints on it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooooooooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like im assuming they dont like "talk" about that kinda stuf like we would in the u s of a
Bill: I read an article a very long time ago on the topic.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they do but they gotta be drunk or suuuuuper close
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a bit taboo to have a general conversation on the topic
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive read one about an american girl who likved there and had a bf and they had very different expectations of each other XD
Bill: it was written by an american woman who was dating or married in japanese culture. Biggest take away was it's not a two person show, one person supposed to do all the work.
Bill: she like, moved while he was doing the do and he got all weirded out.
N🆗ri (Marisa): a lot of my straight friends had trouble dating japanese guys because the guys thought they were too strong/independent/intimidating. a lot of guys i know who date japanese girls thought they were clingy/too expecting/demanding.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA same article
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he was like "why are you moving, im i not doing good?"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and she was like "what? no?"
N🆗ri (Marisa): my one friend V told me about a girl he dated. they were going somewhere to meet her sister and it turns out the sister was on the same train, so V was like "hey! we should change cars and go see her!" and the gf was like "...why?"
so after some persuading they changed cars to be in the same one as the sister and the gf and the sister just nodded at each other and then continued to ignore each other until they got to the destination train stop and V was really confused
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh hmmmm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): V is american?
N🆗ri (Marisa): indian
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~no he korean~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): he likes to make our british classmates uncomfortable
Bill: ~~was waiting for that~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): I noticed the whole culture reflecting on most anime
Dirty Lego (Tom): Sex scenes don't really seem to be a thing in anime
Dirty Lego (Tom): But are super normal in American culture
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): seems like they kinda put sex in a box?
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like its hard to find it unless you decent directly to porn
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like it doesn't need to be shown
Dirty Lego (Tom): It can be referenced
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): there seems to be no sex unless the WHOLE media is dedicated to it
Dirty Lego (Tom): Or like, they start and screen pans away
N🆗ri (Marisa): japan has stricter censorship laws i think. that's why there's less in anime.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oooo
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's fine to jot show it but they rarely reference it
N🆗ri (Marisa): comiket is like pornpalooza
N🆗ri (Marisa): there are a lot of adult shops in tokyo too. the station i used to go to school every day was in the middle of a major love hotel neighborhood. i never explored there much.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there was also a soapland right by the supermarket that sold the good nikuman
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like we're not asking for literal porn to be in anime, they can have sex without showing anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah and i lived right next to that brothel district! i forgot about that.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Maybe that's not allowed either
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe to be marketable to a younger audience they leave it out. wasn't goblin slayer pretty uncensored?
Bill: Pretty uncensored.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Goblin Slayer was yeah but there was no relationship sex
Dirty Lego (Tom): And again it doesn't need to be shown
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like for exampe if in Clannad they had a brief scene of Nagisa and Tomoya in bed, they kiss and it pans away. But instead she's just pregnant
Dirty Lego (Tom): Also they never show them kiss at all nano
Dirty Lego (Tom): I think they hold hands once
Dirty Lego (Tom): Its just a stark contrast to Western media
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that why we're always portrayed as blonde nympos in japanese media
Dirty Lego (Tom): Possibly 👌
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but like... idk there seems to be rape scenes or dirtyish scenes but not like healthy "these people love each other" scenes?
Dirty Lego (Tom): But it's not like we're looking to see sex, or see boobs. Just looking for the romantic connection that sex sometimes comes with. But they are usually void of that
Dirty Lego (Tom): Which is why Tokyo ghoul doing it is so revolutionary to us
Bill: Japanese media tends to romanticize the chase, rather than the relationship.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah..
Bill: Did you guys look at Wotaku?
Bill: That's more about adult relationships.
Bill: Josei as a genre doesn't get alot of anime adaptions, but is focused on more mature romantic stories (it's marketed at 18-21+ women)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea of course, ~~thats probably why it doesnt get attention~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): rip, anyway
Dirty Lego (Tom): Regardless I will treasure Tokyo ghoul now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): feels like they veiw sex as dirty
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We stan one anime/manga
Bill: They do. Sex is kinda like that in japan. Shameful.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea thats sad
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont mean that in a mean way
Bill: Link nsfw:

https://www.sankakucomplex.com/2011/07/31/the-difference-between-american-sex-japanese-sex/
Dirty Lego (Tom): That hurts to look. At
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's kind of dirty a bit, but it's also kind of a "that's just a thing humans do." nudity wasn't seen as bad in japan until after american occupation post-wwii
like using the bathroom or sneezing, it's not really talked about but it's a thing that happens.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "it" being peen?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): huh... interesting
N🆗ri (Marisa): in that above link probably ya
Bill: The article from japanese 4chan, but the the japanese side of comparision is accurate.
Bill: ~~you know all about the american side~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its not just "one way" though
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oof this is confusing
N🆗ri (Marisa): dirty jokes are really popular in japan
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wait
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): “When foreigners are having sex it doesn’t feel like the woman is being raped. It’s more like two people are fighting each other on an equal basis. Like a sport, in fact.”
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😬
Bill: Other descriptions I've seen basically describe japanese sex as guy humps, woman imitates dead fish.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Big O O F
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im hoping thats an american description?
Bill: Which is what the comment refers to.
Dirty Lego (Tom): They say it again later too
Bill: That was the article written by an american woman ye.
Bill: ~~remember this is from japanese 4chan~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): That japanese women tend to act as if they are getting "defiled"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😦
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats so sad!
Bill: and that's apparently a cultural kink.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah sounds likenit
Bill: that I'd need more sources to confirm, but... kinda lines up.
Dirty Lego (Tom): All American women are blonde haired bitches who have sex every second and are dominant
Bill: note the disclaimer these people have no idea what americans are like beyond porn.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oof
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~think ill dye my hair back now~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): according to the animes, usually there's one side overpowering another side. either the guy does everything or the girl does everything dominatrix-style. i can't think of any middle ground examples
Bill: Ye. Very rare.
Dirty Lego (Tom): EY TOKYO GHOUL
Dirty Lego (Tom): GOOD ON THEM
N🆗ri (Marisa): actually from most houses i've seen in japan, married couples sleep separately.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like idk it just makes me feel bad for the women? like do they not enjoy iy at all?
N🆗ri (Marisa): they'll sleep in the same room but on 2 different beds
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like is it basically marriage rape?
Bill: um? what is this, the 50s?
Bill: Well, japanese women in the majority are no longer interested in sex.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like "oh ill just ave sex to make him shut up" kinda thing
Bill: Sankaku will have more articles on it, but I saw one finding the above article that 50% of males in Japan are virgins?
Bill: Their sex culture isn't really healthy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo y'know what. that's why yaoi always have the seme and the uke. one side needs to be more dominant.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye
Bill: correct.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and like any hentai stuff ive seen seems the same way. like either the girl is a dirty slut, or shes being raped
Bill: or a virgin.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Devoid of romance
Dirty Lego (Tom): Riparoni
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well i guess i mean more like shes either REALLY INTO IT or is being raped
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and they guy is either evil looking or a no face shota
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'll say that Tokyo ghoul is the most accurate account I've seen in a while, and on top of that it's the ONLY realistic account I've seen from Japan..
N🆗ri (Marisa): Trigun might have a scene like that, it’s been too long I can’t remember. 
Panty and Stocking also somewhat? But Panty is the one in charge so it still reinforces stereotypes
N🆗ri (Marisa): There probably are some but I’ve skipped over them lol
In this corner of the world had a good representation of relationships
Dirty Lego (Tom): I believe trigun might have one, I'll have to check
Dirty Lego (Tom): Never watched it
Dirty Lego (Tom): It scared me as a kid
N🆗ri (Marisa): Vash is so good
Dirty Lego (Tom): I know he's silly
Dirty Lego (Tom): 👌 🙏
Bill: Panty and Stocking is supposed to have the feel of an american series, so maybe. It's also heavily parody.
Dirty Lego (Tom): POWERPUFF DOO DOO DODODOODO DOO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sorry if i made you uncomfortable with the sex talk mawisa, im also not culturally knowledgeable. As an american girl someones the depicting of sex i see that come from japan make me uncomfortable
N🆗ri (Marisa): *i know for sure the powerpuff girls anime has no H in it*
is ok!! the talk is for science so it's cool.
unless talking like this is your fetish then gross
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh god no
Bill: lol
Dirty Lego (Tom): Are you sure Powerpuff has no hnin it
Dirty Lego (Tom): Have you seen sedusa?
N🆗ri (Marisa): it has some upskirt shots but nothing worse
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh you mean the anime version?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ya!
Bill: henshin da wan!
N🆗ri (Marisa): if anything ppg doujinshi is the most perverted but bleedman is a known lolicon
N🆗ri (Marisa): i like how sedusa in the US version is all skintight while the japanese one is all ruffles
very telling
Bill: well due, it Doujin.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was good before it wasn't
バナナ: https://i.redd.it/616b6fkw09c21.jpg
N🆗ri (Marisa): dead or alive extreme volleyball is a good sports game
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooo in that thing biru posted before one of the thing said was that Japanese men have harder peens or soemthing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sounds fake but ok
Dirty Lego (Tom): It said that japanese men seem to be under the impression that that is the case
Dirty Lego (Tom): It is false
Dirty Lego (Tom): They figure smaller means harder cuz more dense,that is in fact not how the human body works
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ah ok yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz like??? i coudlnt imagine that
Bill: According to the jim jefferies show podcast; asian women have lighter periods too.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Stiffness is entirely dependent on amount of cells you have in the "sponges" and how much blood is being transferred
Bill: ~~you've researched this?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i dont think the periods thing is true. there were a lot of big pads (tampons are not popular), and ibuprofen is marketed exclusively as a period relief drug
Dirty Lego (Tom): They fill with blood and pressurize and seal
N🆗ri (Marisa): they call it eve
Dirty Lego (Tom): So amount of pressure is what holds the erection
N🆗ri (Marisa): when u buy pads in a convenience store though they put it in a paper bag in a smaller bag in your regular bag. top secret pads.
Dirty Lego (Tom): **Top secret**
Dirty Lego (Tom): Can't show bra straps either, boobies are secret
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's a secret
Dirty Lego (Tom): Secret.. is a wierd word
Dirty Lego (Tom): I've said it too many times now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the periods thing makes sense in theory cuz asians are smaller on average ans smaller women sometimes have less heavy periods?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): or that could just be some weird conclusion i came to in my mind
N🆗ri (Marisa): my periods cause me to purge and faint and knock me unconscious for a few hours so idk how true that is
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i mean idk how you would gather info on that so its prob just an asuption i made since alot of my skinny friends were like "i dont get cramps"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and my more average or overwiegh friends would die on theres
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my period also didnt imporve at all when i lost 30 pounds so its prob bs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): birth control saved my life tho now i dont die
N🆗ri (Marisa): how have humans made it this long
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i have no idea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Marisa do you use hormonal birth control?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I used to get cramps so bad I couldn’t move but with hormones they went bye bye
N🆗ri (Marisa): no, i inquired about it once but my family has a lot of stroke and heart risk history so it wasn't recommended
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't like taking medicine. i'll take an inbuprofen if i physically can't lift myself off the floor after about an hour and a half but otherwise i'm ok with Suffering™
N🆗ri (Marisa): my mother takes like 10 aspirin a day (it's recommended by her doctor to take a certain amount each day) but she's always like "u need medicine" lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): when did you start taking hormones if you don't mind me asking?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i just started again in the summer
I took them for the first time at 16 but i would get a yeast infection after every period with that particular pill
N🆗ri (Marisa): o u c h
N🆗ri (Marisa): did you switch to a new one?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): oof
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i got the patch in 2016 right before going to college
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i was really nauseous to strong smells for a month but my cramps went away and if anything i got a little happier than i was before
N🆗ri (Marisa): that makes you sound like a hardened criminal :3 "the patch"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _i am, the patch is super edgy_
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea im on a different one now!
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wouldve done the pill but i live a fast ~~and forgetful~~ life so i dont think i couldve kept up with it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): when i took it at 16 id also puke if i took it on an empy stomache and id forget alot
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but i take it at 7pm no which seems to be a more reliable time for me
N🆗ri (Marisa): were you more sensitive to smells georgia, or did they just make you nauseous? was it like a superpower with a weakness or just a weakness
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH NO JESS DON'T DO THAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): 7pm good time
N🆗ri (Marisa): 7pm time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i havnt missed it all now
Dirty Lego (Tom): It also helped mood swings a bit <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> everything was def wacky for a few months or so if I recall correctly 🤔
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): it was like a superpower with a weakness lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea my period go messed up for like 4 months but im waaaay better off now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): maybe you could ask your doctor about a low doasage?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): since not getting pregnant inst your main concern with it maybe they could do something else
N🆗ri (Marisa): my symptoms are incredibly sudden and happen randomly. luckily it only happened once in public and it was right before a test so i was able to go home ~~before school even started~~. i did miss a really cool field trip i really wanted to go on though one time.
N🆗ri (Marisa): pregunto
N🆗ri (Marisa): it could be something is horribly wrong with me but doctors are so much effort
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😦
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think it only happened twice last year luckily
N🆗ri (Marisa): but it gets really gross
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I was scared when u said it happened in japan 😦
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz no one could be there for you 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah! i was freaking out a bit, especially because i didn't have any kind of medicine, but luckily my floor was soft
N🆗ri (Marisa): nice and cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): everything gets purged so i get really hot and sweat a lot then afterwards it's super freezing but i can usually drag myself to a bed at that point
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg japanese bath tubs are the best
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're really deep
N🆗ri (Marisa): good for clean
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): how do u surivive without taking pills tho D:
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i would take 2 acetaminophen and 2 ibuprofen like every 4 hrs
N🆗ri (Marisa): i pewish
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo. yeah sometimes i take a pill if it's really really bad. when the pain doesn't fade after a while while on the floor then i'll take a pill or two. but usually the pain goes away ~~once everything is vomited up~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): i always lay somewhere with a nice cool tile 👍
N🆗ri (Marisa): imagine dealing with this stuff like 4000 years ago. that would suck.
N🆗ri (Marisa): although maybe diet impacted it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): not as much pain if you're constantly hunting and starving?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea ive heard that diet can effect it?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it stops completely if you're not eating enough
N🆗ri (Marisa): girls in concentration camps during wwii didn't get their periods
