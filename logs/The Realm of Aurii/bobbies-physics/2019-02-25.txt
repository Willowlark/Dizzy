N🆗ri (Marisa): am i considering too many lewd cosplay
im trying to get my confidence up because it's at 0 but i don't want to be too lewd i just wanna like myself
and i figure wearing fleshtone color tights and fake chests under everything keeps it modest but others probably don't see it that way
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): slightly lewd
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok i stop
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): goal: help marisa gain .1 confidence by next con
N🆗ri (Marisa): woah way to start with the S rank hard difficulty goal
N🆗ri (Marisa): like a bunny suit would just show the same amount of skin as pyrrha right? but no one wants to do it rip
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): .01?
N🆗ri (Marisa): monumental boss level goal
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just cosplay 2B and your good
N🆗ri (Marisa): but that's you!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah you!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): id let you borrow mine but its prob too big for u
N🆗ri (Marisa): they have it for about $30 on some sites
N🆗ri (Marisa): but i can't be jess :0
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nicu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you said you felt good in emma right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!!! lots of people recognized her but i'm not happy with my own costume. it can be better.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~or rather i'm not happy with myself lol~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nuuuuu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OO u look really good in Mari
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean i think you look good in lots of cosplays
N🆗ri (Marisa): mari was so embarassing rip it was so hot my makeup melted off
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo and katara!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i finally lost my tanline from that costume tho!!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you look good in everything!
N🆗ri (Marisa): katara was fun. that was fun.
like in mari even though it's a bathing suit i was wearing tights and another leotard under the suit so it felt like i had a lot on so i dont consider it very lewd
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u
N🆗ri (Marisa): and maid saber, that was backless but to ensure the backlessness worked i had 3 different backless tops on underneath the main outfit
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think its more about how u feel in it? like some of my most skin covering cosplays make me feel confident
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm ye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think the attention i get contributes to that thou
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like each time ive cosplayed seven ive gotten alot of attention and that makes me feel good and confident
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): which makes no sense cuz theres like 100 of them
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah emma was the first time in a long time i got any kind of attention in costume, and i was shocked when someone knew bakarina and someone approached me for her. that was fun. aside from emma and that one katarina dude i didn't get any hall shots or no one talked to me about my costumes over katsu

your seven is awesome!! that's why!! u got them cool eyes
Bill: You can cosplay whatever you want. You won’t be judged for it. Just start small, don’t invest too much in lewder stuff or jump right into fake Bobbie boudoir. Build your confidence slowly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel like there are going to be a lot of emma cosplayers very soon, like how chise got super popular, since emma is very simple and my cosplay will fade into obscurity again
Bill: ~~Though as I say that, I had the thought that diving headfirst is probably the easier way to go~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): the 'lewder' stuff is a lot cheaper and easier to make tho <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Dirty Lego (Tom): True that
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's why i consider it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you would have gotten more attention as ray but the gaylord had cleared out alot by then. people did notice you in ray though! we passed a group of girls on our way outside and they pointed at you and said "wow"
Dirty Lego (Tom): Less clothes is easier wooo
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah true!
N🆗ri (Marisa): eeehhhh. but my makeup and my jacket for ray sucked
they wowin at u
Bill: Are you trying to lean towards it for cost or for confidence? You need a lot of outfits for confidence building.
Bill: *dont
N🆗ri (Marisa): both perhaps? benefit of low cost and potential high confidence return
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no it was def you XD me and tom got like nothing all day then you showed up and everyone was like "wow it them"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what cosplay do you feel your best in?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): or your top 3
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmmm
Morgiana
Raven even though no one ever knows who she is
trying to find a third 🤔
Bill: Do you want more recognition from your cosplays? Do you want to cosplay in groups? Cosplay what you like, damned the other things?
N🆗ri (Marisa): groups would be fun but i don't wanna bring the groups down
and everyone seems to make so many friends from cosplaying but my con friends are more from staffing with the same people for eternity
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WAT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): bring group down? never silly!
N🆗ri (Marisa): also i'm bringing everyone down right now <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> u don't need to deal with my inadequacy you can go do fun things instead right now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): MAWISA NOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just wanted to know if people thought i was bein lewd and that would make a bad image and make people think im lewd
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we're your friends!
Bill: The only thing you can do to bring me down is think we don’t want you around or in groups.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we here to support you! i love cosplaying with you! 😭
Bill: I will buy more Pizza for you if you don't acknowledge we love you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nO WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH
Bill: Then say it, "Everyone in Aurii love me"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~like legit had a really good time cosplaying with you~~
Bill: ^ never seen Jess so happy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~plz cosplay mm with me again~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~Or anyhting~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess happiest with green tea kitkats i shall continue to feed her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i do like green tea kit kat, but i like u more!
Bill: If you want more groups, you'll just need to slow down a bit. Spend a whole day in BNHA, RWBY cosplays.
Bill: We've got groups running for both at pretty much every con still.
Bill: You can save time not making so much before the con too. (Or knowing you, you'll improve the costume so much we'll be calling you canon everything)
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll cosplay mineta then you'll have to let me in your bnha groups
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw ill never be a cannon
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: ~~I know you want to do lewd things but don't wear a diaper in public~~
Bill: ~~just embarassing~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): a lot of groups have the characters i cosplay already taken by really good cosplayers aND THAT IS EXTREMELY VALID
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll be hagakure!
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮 you can always double up on a character
Bill: we allow duplicates. Always.
Bill: I'll never be involved with a group that doesn't, I feel cosplay shouldn't exclude.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah but the other person is always way better
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nuuuuuuu
Bill: Cosplay 👏 is 👏 not 👏 a 👏 competition 👏
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've been the duplicate in groups before, i was replaced in most pictures in my own private yona shoot because i invited another yona who was super adorable, and twice in other shoots i never got any pictures taken or got any pictures back after being invited as the duplicate
Bill: and if your right and it IS, I'll swear to never cosplay.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye is not a competition but other people are so gorgeous
Bill: *well you shot with random asshat photographers, that's the problem*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i still feel weird about it, i want that other person to enjoy being an awesome them without worrying about including me
Bill: if being them excludes you they should get slapped upside the head.
Bill: If other people are more gorgeous is a valid reason I'll never cosplay. I'm probably the most unattractive person in BNE, and Mirio is often cosplayed by hot dudes. So I should just not cosplay?
N🆗ri (Marisa): they the fresh princes
N🆗ri (Marisa): no ur such a cool mirio tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): u pull him off like irl mirio
N🆗ri (Marisa): how can you be the most unattractive person in bne if that's me <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: AND YOU ARE A GREAT EVERYTHING QE - FUCKING D.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: So confidence Marisa. Take some of Georgia's, she has it in fucking spades.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): MARISA NO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YOU ARE SO CUTE
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THE CUTIEST!
Bill: You can't say 'others do it better' as a reason without being a hippocrite.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye georgia is awesome!!
noooo i am garbage bag
the thing is i'll always place other people above me and always find everyone else better, but while still doing that i want to at least think a little better of myself
Bill: You v cute Mawisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but everyone else does everything so much better
N🆗ri (Marisa): magical girl biru for zenkai 2k19
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's 2019 right
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah
Bill: They dont? You are the first person I'd go to for anything cosplay related.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i always rush everything <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): im tryna learn to not do that tho
Bill: You might be thinking they're better cause they reuse the costume? Like, Pyrrha has had half a dozen upgrade sessions. That's what helps make it look so good. You do lots of new stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah even from the beginning everyone looks good. the upgrades do upgrade them but they upgrade an already good start
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea also you make lot of stuff! i buy or modify most of mine
Bill: *Your look good in the beginning too*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): also u do male makeup waaaay better than me i dont even try lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll try making a video tomorrow then ~~if i'm over this sickness~~
i've been considering cosplay videos like how erik does his song stuff
but i gotta filter them 500% or i'll look awful
and maybe making videos will make me feel a bit better. possibly. but probably not because garbage
N🆗ri (Marisa): nO jess ur such a handsome dude
N🆗ri (Marisa): girls swoon at ur seven
N🆗ri (Marisa): i become a gremlin given food and water after midnight
Bill: wrapping this around, because your argument you aren't cute enough is ***INVALID***, what do you want more of in your cosplaying?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that just cuz i have an oddly chissled jawline for a woman
Bill: Recognition? Following? Awards? Friends? Photos? Groups?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA tell me whatcha want whatcha really really want
Bill: (am I missing any categories?)
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm. perhaps more friends and to just feel nice about myself. ~~and photos and groups that would be rad too~~. i feel like a trash gremlin at cons because everyone is so fancy and amazing. cons have changed a lot in the last decade so whereas before there'd be a lot of people to talk to, no one really speaks to me anymore outside of u guys
N🆗ri (Marisa): which u guy are awesome and i appreciate and is fun
N🆗ri (Marisa): but i don't like bothering u all the time u gotta be free and live your lives
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you have literally never bothered me my entire life
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats kinda why i like the small cons?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like you stick out more and mroe people talk to you cuz there isnt like an assload of people around
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no ones running to get anywhere either
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> may know better, but I've only met people at cons through group shoots. Go to fandom shoots, don't rush away from them, talk about the thing (FE, RWBY, etc) and join facebook events/groups/discords for them. Do a lighter schedule, focus on one or two costumes a day, based around group shoots. Think homestuck groups. 

For small groups, bring up Ruby and Neon, or do BNHA something and just say so. BNE will get behind groups, especially in the fandoms popular at the moment. We're in a bit of a lull, BNHA might get swapped out sometime soon, but RWBY is a constant. 

YOU ARE NOT A FUCKING GREMLIN. 

Katsu is a shit con for socializing. Don't use that as the bar. Zenkai will be different. And like I said, you can't compare yourself to others. If you do you'll never be happy. Do what you want to cosplay, spend as much time as you need to be proud of your work. If that involves missing self imposed deadlines, DO IT. Leanna showed us all that was a much better idea than suicide crunching.
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, am i hard to approach? or talk to? i know my speech is very self centered i try not to do that. and i tend to go off on my own. I went to a lot of fandom shoots at katsu and a few group shoots like that dangan ronpa one, i usually go to a lot of those at cons and join the facebook pages.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): your not hard to approach at all!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like at cons lots of people are shy and jut stick to who they know
Bill: Katsu is a shitshow for socialization. Do not use Katsu as a bar.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait no it's because i never respond to people online. i forgot i do that constantly.
Bill: You aren't hard to approach.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *what do i say to them??* i take forever trying to think of a good response and then it's like a week later and then it feels weird responding to them so late
Bill: And Jess is right, being shy is pretty normal.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***like tatsumi i gotta respond to her she is too pure for this world*** <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): cosplay speed dating time
Bill: I have no idea how to talk to new people. The only success I've had is fandoms and memes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): communicate through dabs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im bad at making friends too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they kinda just show up
Bill: I'm being serious though. the beginning of Georgia and I was rwby fandom talk.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if not for biru id have like no cosplay friends
Bill: ~~If not for you and Tom they'd all have moved on from me by now~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🙀
N🆗ri (Marisa): Zenkaikon party con for the 20 minutes I’m around
Bill: You are spending all the time with us!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): for reals marisa we love having you around ❤
Bill: Seriously.
Bill: You are a precious NAKAMA.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and we all think you are v. talented and super sweet
Bill: and want nothing more for your happiness.
Bill: and for you to eat.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok i bring more kitkats
you guys didn't eat enough at katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): and we can make little teru teru bozu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: oh cute!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~you are canon ray, dont even try to argue~~
Bill: she really is. ~~Sorry Tom~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): meet me in the pit with a pair of bop em sock em gloves
N🆗ri (Marisa): SOCKER BOPPERS
MORE FUN THAN 
A PILLOW FIGHT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): throwback
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~ill be your MC anyday bby~~
Bill: MM slumber party!
Bill: We gotta do that!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have... 5? MM cosplays?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh and budget yoosung
N🆗ri (Marisa): MM SLUMBEE PARYY
Bill: You just need to come up!
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ll bring Elizabeth
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~Georgia has a rika wig too~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): omw
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~she has the whole rika cosplay~~
Bill: ~~Star technically but lol~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its ok
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): all she needs is a dress and we're good
Bill: ~~Rika bad ending~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): And a cult with a single bombproof room
Bill: Tom and Jess get all gay, Marisa quick changes into V and we shoot that bad ending.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): AHHH NOOO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i want angsty v/rika pics
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone bring a gun
N🆗ri (Marisa): For fun
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh i have a gun!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean not a real gun
N🆗ri (Marisa): O oscars are on
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi9-5MBgObf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
Bill: is there a full art of that outfit for V?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that gun whoo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ye!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Woah look it’s unknown!!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats what he wears in another story
N🆗ri (Marisa): With a gun!!
Bill: I'm not having much luck finding anything.
Bill: ~~Oh no Rika cute~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): Biru cosplay rika
Bill: Ya'll and Erik were having so much fun with it I was considering V... ~~Rika cute, not be her cute~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THERE HE IS i couldnt find the full body one
Bill: Oof that's not a blazer is it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its as trenchcoat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): to hide secrets in
N🆗ri (Marisa): I kept misspelling wallscroll and then it was listed as tapestry rip
Bill: If it was a blazer it'd have been easy to throw together, which was the perk of the another story version.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Be v we can get the entire cast
N🆗ri (Marisa): long blazer
Bill: But would it make sense to another story, over OG.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~cuz you are not blind?~~
Bill: ~~you were super insistent Jumin wasn't in the canon for Ray MC stuff~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH yea lol
Bill: || Rika blinded V? shit damn ||
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): gotta do this
N🆗ri (Marisa): He just doesn’t have interactions
Vs got them interactions
Like a V and Jaehee or V and Zen shoot wouldn’t make sense but you could pair V with anyone else
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA shes a savage
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): V knows everyone
Bill: || She hot though ||
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~and everything~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): remeber yesterday when you where like "wow people are attracted to killgrave?!"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh how the tables have turned
Bill: Well, I haven't seen the actual content, just read summaries. That might help.
Bill: ~~but also I'm a lonely fuck and she hot~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: So basically either works. Another outfit with the trenchcoat, black button up, and black slacks; or the cardigan and black shirt, dark jeans and boots.
N🆗ri (Marisa): don’t forget
Bill: nah tho.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you gotta
Bill: Think I like another story better.
