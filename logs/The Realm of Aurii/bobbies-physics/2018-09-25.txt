Elfriede (Tom): every, single, post
Elfriede (Tom): I know people are fast with cosplay but I had a mini heart attack that somehow someone did this already. Then I realized it was drawn.
Aldus (Jess): Ye theres more in the tag
Bill: Fooled me.
Bill: Tbh that just a leotard like that I’d believe a cosplayer could do in this timeframe. If they already had the wig.
Aldus (Jess): Well yeah
Aldus (Jess): They probably already had that too
Aldus (Jess): It's a closet cosplay
Bill: Well, the big dress and shell wouldn’t qualify for closet.
Elfriede (Tom): That's a whole lotta tiddy
Bill: Is this news to you? 😂
Aldus (Jess): No I mean this is a closet cosplay version
Bill: Tho, big tiddy isn’t as universal as I’d have though. Some of the art on the board yesterday was loli bowsette.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I've seen the lolis starting to spawn too
Elfriede (Tom): Shame
Bill: Now Tom, all sizes matter.
Bill: ~~assuming we’re talking about adult lolis anyway~~
Elfriede (Tom): HA ADULT LOLIS
Elfriede (Tom): The 9000 year old ones
Elfriede (Tom): No oppai /= loli
Aldus (Jess): It *is* anime
Bill: True loli = bad. Adult loli = uh, I guess. Pettanko = 👌🏻
Aldus (Jess): Oh, ok
Nokri (Marisa): ペッタン
ペッタン
ツルペッタン
Music note emoji
Bill: Shoulda said pettanko before, but loli is faster to type in a car.
Aldus (Jess): What if they are just flat shested and don't care?
Nokri (Marisa): shested
Nokri (Marisa): I like the sound of that
Bill: I think pettanko usually refers to flat chested in general.
Bill: Right Mawisa?
Aldus (Jess): Ahhhh I have anime and it's stupid classifications
Nokri (Marisa): Ya pettan means like flat and crushed and I think they stick -ko at the end to mean girl
Bill: To the original point, all tit good tit.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): ha haha thats a good one
Elfriede (Tom): Best tit right there
Elfriede (Tom):
