Bill: *oh useful*
Aldus (Jess): dreft
Bill: nani?
Nokri (Marisa): probably easier than blood tho?

Bill: oh it's a real thing.
Bill: I didn't actually read the article, uh...
Aldus (Jess): yea its made for baby related stains, poop, spit up, formula, breast millk
Aldus (Jess): tom bought it on accident thinking it was just regular stain remover (which it will work fine for also) but it somes in really handy when my 'niece' spits up on my beige couch
Nokri (Marisa): o das nice
Bill: https://offspring.lifehacker.com/how-to-get-breast-milk-stains-out-of-your-clothes-1826538083 Doesn't say dreft, unless it's a `enzymatic stain remover`.
Aldus (Jess): idk but it works
Bill: Also, if that url is to believed lifehacker has a whole category for "offspring".
Nokri (Marisa): cold water and salt works to clean stuff in a pinch so tears make a good emergency stain remover
Bill: USEFUL.
Aldus (Jess): hydrogen peroxide does wonders for blood stains
Nokri (Marisa): yee das the stuff ðŸ‘Œ
Bill: ~~there's a reason that's called rubbing alcohol Mawisa~~
Bill: ðŸ˜¼
Aldus (Jess): those arent the same thing tho
Nokri (Marisa): *you don't drink it*
Nokri (Marisa): it's used for first aid stuff right
and also blood
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: So that's the loophole. If you don't drink the alcohol Marisa doesn't care.
Bill: _injects bourbon into bloodstream._
Bill: ***shivers***
Bill: ugh, I imagined that now my arm feels weird.
Nokri (Marisa): here bourbon is a brand of chocolate
Aldus (Jess): you can use a high proof regular alcohol to clean a wound in a pinch.but yea alcohol and  hydrogen peroxide aren't the same thing tho
Nokri (Marisa): hydrogen peroxide works equally well on human blood and whatever blood supermarket liver has
Aldus (Jess): i find hydrogen peroxide works better on stains than alcohol
Nokri (Marisa): ooo i wouldn't use rubbing alcohol to remove stains. that's what i use to dye wigs i use it to make sure stains stay.
