Aldus Larian (Jess): yall i found an even worse one
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): .....oh my God
Aldus Larian (Jess): bro wtf
Bill: I’m still confused. As far as I’m concerned you should be going into sex wanting to make your partner ecstatic. Which of course means they enjoy it.
Bill: Their enjoyment should be your pleasure as well.
Aldus Larian (Jess): as far as your concerned sure. alot of people dont think that way, unfortunately there are still to many people who think like that guy, alot of women have been taught differently or believe they shouldn't enjoy sex because it is shameful or wrong. Alot of this attitude isnt even intentional its just been ingrained in society.
Bill: I’m agreeing with you he’s wrong...
Aldus Larian (Jess): but you said you were confused
Bill: I’m confused because what he is saying makes no sense.
Bill: And then I said what I think because that’s what does make sense to me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea!
Aldus Larian (Jess): i feel bad for his wife if he has one ~~which he shouldnt~~
Bill: Why would I be in agreement with him...
Aldus Larian (Jess): no no i wants thinking that!
Aldus Larian (Jess): i thought you were like confused as to why i was sharing it i guess?
Bill: Aaah.
Bill: Yeah no, I get it. Cause he’s a tool.
