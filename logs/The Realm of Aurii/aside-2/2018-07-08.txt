Elfriede (Tom): Feeling on the cooler side from just finishing his bath Elfriede held up a hand and shook his head, politely denying a drink. He moved to sit down glancing about the room, inspecting what he had made of it in such a short time of living there.

Faun glanced back over to Eliran digging through his bag. "How long do you plan on staying in Trisp?" He asked casually, slightly curious.
Eliran (Halim): "Your loss," Eliran responded to Elfriedes refusal, pulling out a small bottle and cracking it open as he sat down. 
"To be honest I hadn't planned on being in Trisp at all. People pay a lot to get news from across the border however, and my companions needed to come." He started, "though now with what happened at the border and the fact Afrins here... I'll probably hang around till she leaves"
Elfriede (Tom): "Ahh. I see, since shell only be here for a little while longer I suppose that's fine." Faun adjusted himself and placed one hand on his pommel as he usually would.

"And...what is it about Enera?"
Eliran (Halim): Eliran looked at Elfriede, thinking.
"What we're about to talk about... is a dangerous topic." He leaned forward putting his elbows on his knees, "I need you to swear you'll help Afina no matter what."
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede leaned forward. Puttying his hands on his thighs, "Of course!" He said excitedly.

He leaned back and broke eye contact, a bit embarrassed at his overreaction. "I will."
Eliran (Halim): Eliran stared at Elfriede for a moment, then stood up and walked over his desk, seeming to fiddle with something on top of it "even if the people who are threatening her are Eraian?" He asked not looking back to the knight.
