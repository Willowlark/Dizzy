Tikur (Kurtis): Just woke up from a car nap and my contact just yeeted out of my eye 👌
Bill: Talking to Dan about photatos has inspired me (again) to do a photographer community discord.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there lots of those!
Bill: But are they any good. ~~and can I be in charge~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): probably not many good ones, any that are decent are probably ruled with an iron fist to prevent it from dissolving into all-out circlejerk
Bill: So ye I wanna make one.
Bill: Set it up as people can join as photographers or people interested in the critique and discussion (ie the models).
Bill: Channel framework.
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0 that fast
Bill: Any holes in key topics?
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow i can't believe aurii isn't your top server
N🆗ri (Marisa): not that i can think of
N🆗ri (Marisa): everything can fit into some category
like props could go into posing, fancy gels into gear, photoshop into post
N🆗ri (Marisa): locations?
Bill: That’s the idea. Locations rolls into links for now.
Bill: Not sure it can support itself.
Bill: That’d mentioned in its topic.
N🆗ri (Marisa): photo dump channel?
Bill: One thing I’m on the fence for is a classifieds of sorts.
Bill: Any halfway decent photographer would not return photos via Discord.
Bill: No need to photo done.
N🆗ri (Marisa): classifieds sounds like a good idea
where would photographers dump their good word that they wanna show off
N🆗ri (Marisa): intro channel?
Bill: The critiques.
Bill: If you are sharing a photo, it should be because you want the criticism on the photography.
N🆗ri (Marisa): put that in server rules so peeps know from the get-go
is there a critique channel?
Bill: The bottom channels.
Bill: If the server gets traction a polls channel.
Bill: I’m only hesitant on classifieds cause if it goes public access (probably the intention, at least a friends of friends thing) setting up shoots with people shouldn’t tie back to the server. Not like I vetted every single person.
Bill: Maybe hold off on that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i figured the classifieds section would be for gear sales
if it's a photography group u probably want to limit the number of cosplayers who aren't photogs because then it just becomes a "model seeking photog" group
Bill: Yeah that's why I'm not going to do the classifieds I think.
N🆗ri (Marisa): write that in the server rules or peeps'll use general for it
Bill: Ooooh. Wise Mawisa is wise.
Bill: https://discord.gg/gaT6pF4 added da rules channel again.
Bill: Give em a read.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i need a cool photography handle like tilt worm
Bill: cool isn't really the word.
N🆗ri (Marisa): radical
N🆗ri (Marisa): gnarly
N🆗ri (Marisa): in a good way
Bill: Gear sale is a thing, but like polls I'mma call that a future endenvor.
Bill: any other ideas?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think is good!
Bill: <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): people started telling me "see you june 2nd" so i presume my party is on june 2nd <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): or something *really  ominous* is happening that day
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): do people still enjoy sack racing
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sure why not?
N🆗ri (Marisa): murder mystery party
the lights go off, i get stabbed, everyone has to find the murderer
N🆗ri (Marisa): my body doubles as a pinata
N🆗ri (Marisa): or trivia. trivia might work.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the teams would be horribly unbalanced. one team would be made up of professors with doctorate degrees, the other would consist of people who never graduated highschool and couldn't understand that "yes, my coworkers spoke english. yes they speak english in india, australia, and slovakia. yes they speak it fluently."
N🆗ri (Marisa): what does he think they speak in australia
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh hey here's an article about that stuff that happened while i was in japan
https://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/crime/2018/09/20/william-henry-jr-lindenwold-slain-la-cascata-complex/1367190002/
Bill: OH oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): "apartment complex"
pls. we're townhouses
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol look how messed up rowan is
Bill: lol. i looked at crime stats once for rowan. most of it was public urination.
N🆗ri (Marisa): was that from the crime stats on the rowan website? that was gold
N🆗ri (Marisa): aw. no data on this crime website but the official university site still has their log!
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://sites.rowan.edu/publicsafety/clery/crimeandfire/cleryapp/index.php?month=2018-03
N🆗ri (Marisa): they have one for georgia too
https://ipo.rutgers.edu/publicsafety/crime-log
Bill: *If I look at that will I constantly worry about Georgia at school?*
Bill: Psych is the best tv show. I swear.
N🆗ri (Marisa): does it help if i say that nowhere is safe and anyone can run into life-threatening danger at literally any moment of any day?  <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a really good book on that subject i recommend
Aldus Larian (Jess): *I constantly worry about Marisa since she lives in a high crime area all the time*
Bill: *oof I was trying to forget*
N🆗ri (Marisa): we all live in a high crime world where everyone is equally unsafe <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess and tom and biru you live in the forest
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): bears with the constitutional right to have arms
Aldus Larian (Jess): But bears don't shoot people, or sell drugs, and usually are pretty easy to scare away
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you sure
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/03/14/cocaine-bear/
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmfao
N🆗ri (Marisa): pablo escobear ate literally half his weight in drugs
N🆗ri (Marisa): watch out
N🆗ri (Marisa): do you guys know about that one guy from that one war that lived in a drug stupor for weeks in the woods and scared away his enemies on skiis
Bill: Klaus?
N🆗ri (Marisa): "Aimo Koivunen, a Finnish soldier who during WW2, over-dosed on amphetamines, lost his squad, laid in a ditch for a week after stepping on a land mine, then travelled over 250 miles on skis, was found alive only weighing 94 pounds. He went on to live another 45 years."

he was carrying his troop's medicine rations and decided to take it all at once
N🆗ri (Marisa): "Koivunen had trouble pulling out a single pill, so he poured the entire bottle of thirty capsules into his hand and took them all.

 After traveling more than 250 miles on skis, he was found and admitted to a nearby hospital, where his heart rate was measured at 200 beats per minute, double the average human heartbeat,[5] and weighing only 94 pounds.[4] In the week he was gone, he subsisted only on pine buds and a single Siberian Jay that he caught and ate raw.[4]"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YO I HAD ANOTHER WEIRD DREAM LAST NIGHT
N🆗ri (Marisa): share!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I had a dream that I was in this room and this woman goes “I’m booting up the simulation” and I’m like okay cool and so this really angry older woman pops up, and so does a child
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I have like a knife or something and I attack the woman
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But then the child has a knife and stabs me?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the original woman goes “the people who you may think are your enemies, or who appear to be, might not be. Carefully consider who might be a threat to you”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And then I woke up!
N🆗ri (Marisa): the hunger games
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That must mean that I have to watch out for children with knives today
Bill: I mean the child wasn't the enemy was it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah the child was!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I assume that the older woman would be a threat because children are dumb
Bill: you were attacking the woman.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But the child had a knife which made the child the priority
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I had to assess the situation and determine who was the greater threat and attack them
Bill: yo shawn was getting a morphine drip in an episode and my arms are wigging out.
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia check the rutgers crime log for children with knives
Bill: When did I get so squeemish with needles.
N🆗ri (Marisa): dont do drugs biru
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t like needles but I can kinda shrug at them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I can watch any amount of blood splatter across anything up until the second they make sound effects
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When there’s a suction noise or a squish noise when someone gets stabbed in a movie I’m like NO
Bill: My trick was really loud music in my ears, my ears hurt so feel that more than the needle.
Bill: Which had really built up my tolerance and I was pretty okay with it until I got blood work last month and I nearly passed out, due to my diet.
Bill: And that wasn't even bad during the blood work, just after.
Bill: Now I get phantom pains when I see/talk about needles.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what makes passing out when getting blood drawn worse is that it can cause short term memory loss, so you pass out and then when you wake up you can't remember where you are
N🆗ri (Marisa): eyyy
Bill: It's specifically the injection though, I can do bloody scenes and stuff fine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): [nurse hacker voice] i'm in
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats what justins job was for a while lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _to hack blood_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): noah says theres something permanently on his medical file that he passes out at blood tests
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was always fine with blood untill I saw Tom spitting blood into the sink after his wisdom teeth were removed
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then I almost passed out but also I hadn't eaten anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s on his **permanent file**
Was. Was spitting blood normal.
Bill: Yeah I think it’s normally. You pull the wisdom teeth so the holes made have to heal?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's normal it was like right after we got home
Aldus Larian (Jess): There's a robin the backyard looking for sticks and is cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): Be careful it might have a gun
Bill: Or a levin sword.
Bill: Did I really used to leave my hair like this all the time. My god.
Bill: I can't do anime hair.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t understand why that selfie is supposed to be yike
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just looks like a diff hairstyle
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bangs look lowkey uneven but that it
Bill: hmm?
Bill: I used to not style my hair and it was a big mop.
Bill: I didn't this morning cause lazy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O that’s bedhead?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That looks like a style lmao
Bill: I used to be such a stickler for the hairstyle when I was younger, but now that I've started styling my hair up off my forehead, I realize how much better a face frame it is and wouldn't want to go back. Elongates the face.
Bill: Post shower, I don't get bedhead that looks good lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): it look like style yee you look like you're gonna go shop at hot topic
Bill: tldr mop hair gives me a round face as opposed to keeping it up like I do.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think it look neet
Bill: lol. I'll have to leave it down sometime, give you guys an actual view.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I pregamed endgame which probably wasn't a good idea but we're here 45 mins early and its still packed even 3 days after release
N🆗ri (Marisa): how long did it take you to watch every other marvel movie for your pregame?
