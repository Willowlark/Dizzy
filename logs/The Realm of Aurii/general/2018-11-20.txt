No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'm thinking something really dumb and anime related because i'm the only otaku in class. they asked me about how the new pokemon game was and I gave a simple explanation of my thoughts and they were like "can you say that in english" and I was like ???? i did!!, so something really dumb for anime is gonna confuse them to no end
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OH i just saw the thing about mailing the gift in the announcement. my bad.
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): trying to find thanksgiving stuff in tokyo but restaurants are only serving it when i have school, and for no less than $60 per person so I'll just have to go to 7/11 and buy a ton of junk food to feast on during class. I've been wanting to wake up early and video call my family during their thanksgiving gathering but no one's returning my messages for the last week.

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ive called in at 9:30 and been like "yea i just got up"
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "i've crashed my car for the 16th time this month"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): all in ll oversleeping is a totally legit excuse as long as you dont do it alot
Bill: You think so?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yup ive only done it twice in 4 years, but everybody is human, shit happens
Bill: Twice in 4 years isn‚Äôt what I thought you meant though lol. Something a little more regular.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): id say 2 times a year
Bill: I still have the high school mentality that being late at all is punishable.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean it IS but shit happens and if you dont do alot its usually not a big deal like in HS they'd mark you down for tardies but you wouldnt actually get in trouble till there were a couple piled up. 

than again i was almost never late cuz if i missed the bus i had to just stay home
Bill: Yeeee. Fair enough. I was late to middle school ally cause oversleeping, mom got the principal to put the fear of god in me and it stuck.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i did get kind of in trouble for being absent alot one year with no doctors notes but i defended myself by saying i couldnt get doctors notes cuz i didn't have insurance and they didn't know what to say
Bill: YEET.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i used to get out of gym by telling paiva i had my period (which was usually true) and hed be like "ok no problem you take it easy, ill give you a 100"

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ooo I skipped the spring semester of gym for my senior year, I bruised my ankle in soccer but I just had them give me a reallllly long medical leave
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): actually now that i think about, almost every attractive male in our grade was in that pool class and i was so thankful for that stupid wort so they didnt have to see my chub
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh yeah Joe was in it too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): girls had to wear tshirts tho

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not that i nessecarily found them all attractive but they were all ~~not chub like me~ so i was self concious
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): also i hated pool cuz it washed off all my make up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): FUCK ive come so far since junior year

Bill: oof.
Bill: None of that here, thank god.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it max $10 but yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): better than working the rest of the day
Bill: It wouldn't have to be long either, and could star a bunch of BNE...
Bill: Start on Junior/villain, cracking knuckles, then wrap camera around to behind him to 'his pov', to see assembled other characters, then basically have each character do a combo against the person with the go pro. 10 seconds or less per person, so it's nice and postable.
Bill: Nora could be one swing from the right, which knocks target back, then a backspin into a left hit that bring him to a knee, then like, blows a kiss before overhead smash,
Bill: does this not sound cool?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea dat could be neat
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think id get motion sickness watching that whole movie
Bill: Oh yeah. it's a trip.
Bill: Probably not worth it out of theatres but me and Andrew saw it there.
Bill: a Fond ‚Ñ¢ Memeory.
Bill: I wanna test this outtttt why am I at worrrrrrrk
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i always get motivation at work
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just not for work
Bill: yeet.
Bill: I wanna do one run of it, see how it looks, before exploring a full sequence.
Bill: ~~wanna be the volunteer with dat hamma?~~
Bill: no wait, fuck cross out.
Bill: Wanna do that?
Bill: Don't need to do full cosplay, can just do it with the hammer for a test run.
Bill: can't be soon obviously, cause thanksgiving and stuff.
Bill: but ye.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea we could prob do that i wish it wasnt cold out boooo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hammer is sumbercome though so you might have to speed up the video lol
Bill: possibly. That's why testing is good.
Bill: We can do it indoors maybe, if there's enough headroom.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): mmm i wouldnt be able to swing high at alll
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): maybe at your house
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh wait nevermins im not recalling your living room correctly
Bill: yeah, may need to play with speeding up video general depending on the difficulty of the choreography. like, say you wanted to end the hammer combo by black out the camera with the head. that would have to be slow because like hell I'm letting you hit my camera that hard.
Bill: not sure if worth using dslr over phone or a go pro I don't have ~~but want and have no impulse control~~.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Georgia's house would be best XD cuz high seiling my hammer is 6 foot tall,, my ceiling is only 8
Bill: so you can easily get that to 10 feet high, that'd probably rule out my garage too.
Bill: Well, for testing we can dress warm lol.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): true
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): when it gets warm i wanns do a 2b and 9s shoot at buttermilk falls
Bill: done deal.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): dont know if i want regular or yukatas yet, could technically do both if we run up the rd to the parks bathroom area
Bill: ye!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): gotta do it after we get alot of rain so it looks like this
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not like dis
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i guess this is technially the wrong channel but in theory id like to do more on location stuff im just weird about getting gawked at
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oof now im getting motivated and i gotta wait like 6months for this
Bill: 90% of people don't give a shit about you.
Bill: Wig or not.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well in the middle of the woods with hikers? there gonna at least be looking at me really weird
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean we got a few comments in nyc where weird shit happens everyday
Bill: it's not like they're going to say anything to you. They'll just keep doing their own thing.
Bill: NYC also has obnoxious people.
Bill: My point is don't worry about it!
Bill: ]
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah people like to ask "what is this for?" "why are you dressed up?" its not rude its just hard to explain sometimes
Bill: If we worried about what other people think, I never would have Mirio! ~~Cause I assumed I'd literally weaken your hall photo game because I'm Not Hot and you guys are the Hot Stuff~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean i know it shouldnt stop me but it makes me nervous
