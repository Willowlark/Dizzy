Aldus (Jess): ~~a pretty hippie~~
Nokri (Marisa): i appreciate in yona that they have shield walls
like. one person will be threatened so someone will jump in front of them to protect them.
then a second person will jump in front of the first person who jumped.
then a third and forth.
sometimes ao will be protecting someone's shoulder.
pure.
Nokri (Marisa): exhibit a
Aldus (Jess): and by "a person" she means yona
Nokri (Marisa): they've done it for kija and yoon too
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: I'mma die.
Nokri (Marisa): wait u have to read yona first
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ao best shield
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~Sometime I wonder if there are other females in this animu beside Yona be ya know~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: My favorite was the four girls holding up the Granny's seat, cuz they were all the same character copy pasted
Bill: ~~like the guys aren't cookie cutter in waifu anime~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I didn't say anything about cookie cutter boi
Nokri (Marisa): in the manga there are!
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~wouldnt be a reverse harem with another interesting female role though~~
Nokri (Marisa): the only other important girl in the anime is an old lady. BoJo cosplays her.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Not the white dragon granny I'm assuming ?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: The only anime where I have no waifus, only husbandos <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): oooo yeah she exists too. naw i'm talkin' about gigan
Nokri (Marisa): https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQuIRY9XF8ukl161LcUxu_yRZiHuqqEn0WAuvMkpN2EXN9hJ-vf
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I don't have a hold on which character I ship with Yona yet tho, need to see the rest
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Some are more in the lead than others but nothing solid yet
Nokri (Marisa): who's in the lead
Bill: Hak I'd imagine, it seems to be popular from the outside.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Probably Yoon
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nah Hak is a meme
Aldus (Jess): ~~tom dont like hak~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~the canon pairing is the yuri pairing~~ jk it's a no homo kiss
Bill: 😏
Nokri (Marisa): yoon is the only one who sleeps with her
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Nokri (Marisa): everyone else has a different tent
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I don't dislike hak, he's amusing
Aldus (Jess): yea but you dont like him either
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~Dynasty warrior op little shit~~
Aldus (Jess): he a dynasty warrior
Aldus (Jess): YE
Nokri (Marisa): these are the girls. plus there's 2 more that were introduced after this pic was drawn
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Are they after the anime ends?
Aldus (Jess): do any of them actually travel with the group though?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah. Yuno is in the anime and Kaya is in an OVA episode but Lili, Ayura, and Tetora get introduced RIGHT AFTER the anime ends. They're in the stage play.  Tao and Kouren are relatively newer.

Lili, Ayura, and Tetora stay for a bit (it's complicated <:lenny:395307171539189760> ) and Lili and Yona become super good friends. Yona stays with Tao for a little while.
Nokri (Marisa): yuno is pretty minor
Nokri (Marisa): lili/ayura/tetora are even in the poster for the stage play which picks up right after the anime ends
Nokri (Marisa): ~~yun is the only one who looks good there~
Nokri (Marisa): tao helps yona when she gets her period tao is a true bro
Nokri (Marisa): kouren is essentially sailor uranus
Aldus (Jess): BEST BOY 10/10
Nokri (Marisa): there's a guy in the manga who goes around nya-ing
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Who's best boy?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And that sounds like the best character by far
Aldus (Jess): the guy who help yona with her period
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Girl I think right?
Nokri (Marisa): princess tao confirmed best guy
Aldus (Jess): opps
Bill: Alright, I'm going to admin up and say quarentine this to animemes.
Nokri (Marisa): all boys have their good qualities. i like zeno but there's big reasons people don't ship him with yona.
i like how everyone else is super embarassed around yona though and zeno just walks in while she's bathing to have a casual conversation and she's like "hey what's up"
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I had to walk 5 blocks with the lens block because subway fucked up.
Bill: le sigh.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Some kid in my class had a "religion: together we can find a cure" shirt today
Afina (Georgia🍀): What a jerk

Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~and they're like wah why don't I get laid~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~i can't believe they are waluigi~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~jk waluigi prob gets laid~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But yeah it's just another form of hate.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 🙏 please get that shit outta here
