do any of you know if the black death stayed in one area for multiple generations, or did it travel?
like, it lasted for 300 years but that was all in different areas as it spread, and the main destruction occurred in the 1300s, but when it hit china or italy did it stay there for the whole 300 years (or even like 100-200 years), or did it disappear after 10-20 years

Tikur (Kurtis): Imagine a slow wave of death that lingers for a few years

Be like, “I’m going to count down from ten and then do this thing,” and start counting down and do the thing 🎉
