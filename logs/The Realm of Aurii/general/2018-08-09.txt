Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~its telling you to eat subway tonight~~
Aldus (Jess): Plz no
Eliran (Halim): Billiam
Eliran (Halim): If we decide to Friday Saturday ota
Eliran (Halim): Would we be able to join your room
Aldus (Jess): It only 1 bed and we have 4 already and is a smooth room
Eliran (Halim): Mk 
What hotel
Eliran (Halim): I need a check if they still have rooms and costs
Bill: Henley park hotel.
Bill: Go through Otakon booking portal. It has deals.
Eliran (Halim): rip henley min check in is 21
Eliran (Halim): funny thing
Eliran (Halim): best priced room for what i want
Eliran (Halim): comes with 2 beds
Eliran (Halim): "Double king bed"
unless that means its a super king bed
Eliran (Halim): <@!184437198865563648> do you have hilton rewards
Eliran (Halim): cause if we stay in optimal spot then i can earn you point
Aldus (Jess): I think he is lying gots Marriott
Eliran (Halim): bill what kind of crazy deal did you get with Henley
Eliran (Halim): i'm intrigued
Bill: Can’t do rewards unless the name on your id is the same as the res and rewards account. I also only do Marriott.
Bill: I wouldn’t say crazy deal. We got a room with sofa bed (called, that’s the only way there are two beds in a room) and with package parking. The latter is a 100 to 150 bucks less for the weekend.
Eliran (Halim): so like
Eliran (Halim): how much do you pay a night
Eliran (Halim): like total not each
Bill: 250.
Bill: Whoops. Forgot that
Eliran (Halim): huh
Bill: #disposableincomesquad.
Aldus (Jess): forgot what?
Bill: To say what the nightly price was.
Aldus (Jess): oh yea you told me the other night
Eliran (Halim): cause i'm looking at the hampton 
its double king size bed
189.01 after taxes and fees
Eliran (Halim): and .2 miles away
Bill: No sofa bed.
Bill: If I’m booking these things I really don’t like ending up on a floor if I don’t have to.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Eliran (Halim): 2 queens for 239 after fees
Eliran (Halim): is the 250 include parking?
Bill: Yup.
Eliran (Halim): for 1 car?
Bill: I assume. We’re only taking one.
Eliran (Halim): hm
Bill: I'm guessing the hampton isn't available saturday into sunday, which is why we didn't get it as an opion.
Eliran (Halim): oh it is
Eliran (Halim): comparing it'd be 254 vs your 250 if you got the double king with parking and a cot
Eliran (Halim): instead of a sofa bed
Bill: pfft.
Bill: A cot.
Eliran (Halim): well specifically a rollaway bed
Aldus (Jess): what is a double king?
Bill: it's not listed on Ota's portal for both dates. It only shows up when booking for friday night only.
Aldus (Jess): like 2 kings? or a California king?
Bill: The rooms are id'd weird in the portal.
Eliran (Halim): yeah the portals wak
Eliran (Halim): I think its like a californian king?
Eliran (Halim): 2 kings would be cray
Aldus (Jess): ye
Eliran (Halim): but ye 
The portals wonky 
Plus the ota deals aren't like 100% available anymore
Eliran (Halim): no parking deals :c
Eliran (Halim): you just gotta figure it out with the hotel separately
Eliran (Halim): or get parking in the spot hero lots
Bill: These are the leftovers. Official booking timeframe is over.
Eliran (Halim): ye
Bill: They up the prices because of the late booking as well.
Bill: And somehow it still better than regular booking.
Bill: which is asinine.
Eliran (Halim): yeah
Eliran (Halim): like 189 at the hampton regular booking (off the ota thing)
Eliran (Halim): is the before fee default
Nokri (Marisa): *hal answer the question about long division your fans want to know*
Eliran (Halim): i cant it dusappeared
Nokri (Marisa): 😱
Nokri (Marisa): We’ll never ever know now.
Bill: Well I called out of the city today. My eye is swollen and weird so I want to go the doctor today. At least I’m not coming home at 11pm before tomorrow’s early morning.
Nokri (Marisa): what did you do to your eye
Elfriede (Tom): Allergies?
Bill: It's too much for allergies. Speculation from mom is a blocked tear duct or something.
Bill: I'm going to her office at 11.
Bill: ```@echo off

(for %%a in (%list%) do (

Aldus (Jess): y tho
Bill: needed to send it to my desktop, which has like nothing but discord and steam installed.
Bill: It's a windows script for one of the other guys at work, I can't test it on my mac.
Aldus (Jess): ooo
Dave: It's a script to get his bank acc info
Nokri (Marisa): holla holla get dolla
Bill: *It's a script that doesn't fucking work, that what*
Nokri (Marisa): Did you try turning it off and on again
Dave: Add more $$ and %% to it, that'll fix it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe you need a good cry bill
Bill: Heh.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _[plays weight of the world outside your house]_
Bill: I mean, idc about the script. Probably would hurt to cry, with my swol eyes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or the TEARS COULD CLEANSE
Bill: Do you just want me to cry? 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think they'll just give you eye drops tho and then you'll be right as rain
Afina (Georgia🍀): Listen if we all talk about Nier that's what's gonna happen
Bill: Do you just want you to cry? 😂😂😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): ***ALL***
Afina (Georgia🍀): I had this really weird nightmare that I bought this game called "Something XX" and accidentally got sucked into the game
Afina (Georgia🍀): And it was a horror game kinda like slender where I had to keep eye contact with this floating mass of black ribbon
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or it would catch me?
Afina (Georgia🍀): But at the same time I was searching for apparently friends that had died in the house, and if I could find their bodies I got a power up
Afina (Georgia🍀): It was WEIRD
Bill: Probs an escape dream tbh.
Bill: 😛
Bill: Or, you’re worried you need a Blake to cosplay with as Yang on Saturday.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I debated runnin out to buy a new zipper for star and wear that
Afina (Georgia🍀): Still debating that while I pack for NC
Afina (Georgia🍀): But Star isn't really an impressive Saturday cosplay
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I think I'll stick with Yang
Bill: You’re going to be social, not impress. You impressed at RTX.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: Just have fun with it. Don’t treat Ota like serious con. There isn’t even a Saturday RWBY shoot.
Bill: If that isn’t a sign of a half assed con I don’t know what is.
Bill: My entire “people you may know” is the real names of every famous RTXer.
Bill: Like.
Aldus (Jess): biru hows your eye
Bill: Sitting for the doctor. I’m fine, it’s just swollen enough that I can feel it and I want to be sure to treat that before it becomes a real problem.
Bill: Makes me feel like I’m tired tho.
Aldus (Jess): hmm wonder whats causing it
Bill: Bacteria? Could be allergens, but this is way more than I get from allergies, and I take allergra every day.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just saw a bumper sticker that said "I'd rather be choking" ?????
Aldus (Jess): Well someone is open
Bill: ~~you can ask them if they have the other half of the set~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's the confusing part of the verb choking
Afina (Georgia🍀): Both the perpetrator and receiver are choking
Eliran (Halim): one is choking 
the other is being choked
Elfriede (Tom): Choking.... Someone?
Elfriede (Tom): Or ... Choking on.... Something?
Elfriede (Tom): That's.. an odd way to put it
Elfriede (Tom): Why not just say I'd rather be choking someone or I'd rather be getting choked
Bill: Doesn't roll off the tongue.
Aldus (Jess): should be on a bumper sticker at all lmao
Bill: *are you kinking shaming them*
Aldus (Jess): nope
Aldus (Jess): opps tried to open 10 files at once and crashed the program losing 2 hrs of work. rip
Aldus (Jess): Almost got t-boned on my home <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Shit.
Aldus (Jess): YEET some dude was pulling out of the car repair place at the end of the road my work is on and almost hit me
Bill: fuck. I need a password from Nadya to finish this.
Nokri (Marisa): Try ‘password’
Nokri (Marisa): Did it work
Nokri (Marisa): Wow it worked. Amazing.
