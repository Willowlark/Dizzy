Bill: That weird mood where you actually think you look good. 

Need to do a “fashion” shoot of myself. Because I judge the fuck out of people on bumble and such that have shitty photos on their account. *Blurry basement party selfies are not flattering morons*.
Bill: So I gotta be up to my own standards.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I started a list of Bumble profile tropes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What I've got so far
Bill: Add “no photo of you alone so you can’t tell who the girl is”, “blurry basement selfie”, “generic ‘I go on hikes’” photo...
Bill: Country girl is a your area thing.
Bill: I think.
Bill: ~~adding to this list is actual motivation to open the thing cause I have none as is~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Those are good
Bill: “My first photo is a swimsuit pic so you can see how hot I am”
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wonder what my dating profile would look like if I had one
Bill: “Obligatory swimsuit photos even when I write things like ‘I hate the beach’”
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "Want a travel buddy, I'm never home"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 🙃
Aldus Larian (Jess): I would prob have a swimsuit pic but I wouldn't never say I hate the beach
Bill: https://www.volumeupkaraoke.com/
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Bill: The no hard liquor thing is bleeeeeh though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): do they have weeb songs

N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~or you guys bring no bad stuff if im not included~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :c
Bill: You are of course included.
Bill: Stop saying silly things.
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia can come if we do karaoke in someone's house in the middle of the day
Bill: But how we going to have the actual karaoke stuff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): youtube and a fake mic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): silly silly bumble people
Bill: *I just want to hear an endless loop of MCR songs because everyone is emo*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the last photo is supposed to be thirst photo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause if theyve swiped all the way to the last photo then theyre considering messaging
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and the last photo HOOKS EM
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): not that ive ever used bumble or tinder BUT BELIEVE ME

N🆗ri (Marisa): oooohohohoho
Aldus Larian (Jess): def not bored, i like marisa quest!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 😏
Bill: I'm not going to join, despite temptation. I either want Aurii running or I want to do some overhauling and transition the campaign setting to maybe run in person.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there is a lot of exciting stuff planned no matter how the plot splits for the quest
i should post in that today
N🆗ri (Marisa): you should at least observe. or i'll observe and report back but i'm awful at picking up on stuff unless someone else is there going "lol wow what a gary stu"
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna watch the flames burn
N🆗ri (Marisa): 1 post per day omg mark

Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo chocolate proceeds are for charity, bless
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah i wonder how much we raised for charity at zenkai
one girl donated a Target Gift Card in my bucket but idk how much it was worth
Bill: Posting daily could be possible if we didn't have wushu encouraging long posts but like. PbP games are *notorious* for having too slow of a pace to keep people interested. ~~case in point~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmm blowdried my hair instead of natural dried my hair for the first time since my haircut
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That blonde is the shit 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): who knows stuff about dnd
are all races equally common or are humans the most common and all other races more obscure
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll just make a human because otherwise i'd be an elephant person
Bill: Depends on the campaign setting.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't really think it matter. Make whatever race you want
Bill: Judging by this group? Everything will be valid.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _furries_
Bill: Yes Marisa wants to play a furry.
