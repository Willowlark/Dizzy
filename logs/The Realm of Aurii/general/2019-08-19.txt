Bill: Time to connect a million devices to the internet.
Bill: I have every game system Iâ€™ve ever owned hooked up.
Bill: N64, GameCube, wii, switch, ps1, ps3, ps4. Also have my computer tower in the tv stand since I mostly play with controller.
Bill: Will I use them all? Probably not. Is it awesome? Hell yeah.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Itâ€™s my adult dream to have one of those square cube organizers with all my consoles hooked up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And LEDs set up in each box
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I can flip a switch and be like MY NERD CAve
Bill: Iâ€™ve got plenty more to unpack but Iâ€™ve been going ham all weekend so... I also wanna sleep.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Whatâ€™s it look like so far?
Bill: Very good. Still got a handful of boxes for den and bedroom, but theyâ€™re not a lot of work. Nothing hung up yet or really decorated yet, thatâ€™ll come with time.
Bill: Gotta start of list of things I need to get at some point and then prioritize.
Bill: I have no kitchen table tho. Thatâ€™s the biggest need.
Nokri (Marisa): Donâ€™t need a kitchen table, youâ€™ve got boxes
Bill: Uh, no. I should be unboxed fairly soon.
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah! Youâ€™ll need a use for all those boxes!
Nokri (Marisa): If you have room you should put a giant sculpture in your apartment instead of a table
Nokri (Marisa): Trendsetting
Nokri (Marisa): we haven't had a table in 8 years we should at least get a sculpture. i wanna get one of a fox
Nokri (Marisa): but not realistic
Nokri (Marisa): a stylistic fox
Nokri (Marisa): no tables just get a ton of those porcelain dolls that weird aunts collect
Nokri (Marisa): walk into biru's apartment like
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): "hey guys! thanks for coming over! take a seat next to jezebelle there and I'll bring out some chips while we play minecraft" - biru
Andrew: Lol.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I basically just need a bed as far as furniture is concerned. Got that living room set this weekend and then I have my grandparent's kitchen table and chairs and then my parent's coffee table and end tables.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *less than 5 weeks*
Bill: I recycled the boxes... cause I donâ€™t need boxes of stuff.
Nokri (Marisa): wow i can't believe you recycled the boxes with the stuff in them. crazy
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): wow i feel so productive right now right as i'm supposed to go to bed to get up super early

Nokri (Marisa): Thatâ€™s the sale price? Thatâ€™s so expensive it looks like theyâ€™re marked up
Bill: That's nerf for you.
Bill: ~~however I no longer live at home and no one can bitch about me owning an airsoft gun sooooo~~ https://www.evike.com/products/36787/
Aldus Larian (Jess): no one would bitch anyway?
Nokri (Marisa): ~~might as well get a real gun~~
Bill: Mom's not a fan of guns that aren't plastic and yellow.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo i thought you meant they'd bitch at you for having nerf guns
Bill: oh no.
Bill: The airsoft Mom wouldn't have liked.
Bill: And it IS her house, so I didn't mind abiding by that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Meanwhile I had a friend in grade school whose parents bought him a bunch of airsoft guns when he was like 10 and we'd have airsoft battles in his yard
Bill: yeah nah... Twas never friends with anyone who did airsoft to kinda normalize it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, they sting if you get shot, but they're not overly dangerous. The pellets are so light that they lose a lot of momentum gettin air resistance so like, you can *see* them coming at you
Bill: mm, I went once. We did that for the 'stereotypical manly' thing of Tom's bachelor party.
Bill: The escape room was more popular.
Bill: anyway not ordering that either. I need a kitchen table more than an airsoft gun I'll never use. XD
Bill: I should take an earlier train home. Gord's not around. I'm utterly exhausted.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Goodwill!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Iâ€™ve seen so many tables when I go to goodwill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Iâ€™m like _fuck thatâ€™s a good table to make cosplay on_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ya know, because dining on a dining table is overrated
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ReStores can have some pretty good furniture too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or FB marketplace. My sister and brother-in-law have gotten some really good shit from FB marketplace
Bill: Sam and Ryan got a bunch of stuff of FB marketplace. Mom's been on there daily too.
Bill: Haven't bought anything from it yet, but one of the options.
Bill: Also been looking at wayfair and now ikea.
Aldus Larian (Jess): My living room furniture is from FB marketplace
Aldus Larian (Jess): Both Sparta houses
Bill: Mmm. It's the next thing to buy, but I'm also trying not to rush too much. I'm *prone* to impulse buying and I wanna buy the right thing.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): PINTERIST STAHP
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mwhahaha
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Also people seem to really love from kobalds
Bill: what.
Bill: Even.
Bill: *They're just lizard goblins, you kill em and loot em, why do they need*
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): *To be thicc*
Bill: They're like 3 feet tall!
Bill: *Sexual deviants*
Aldus Larian (Jess): D and D was a mistake
Bill: It was. We should all be playing BESM which totally doesn't sound like a kink.
Bill: </sarcasm>
Bill: `copy: Always copy data (default True) from the passed DataFrame or named Series objects, even when reindexing is not necessary. Cannot be avoided in many cases but may improve performance / memory usage. The cases where copying can be avoided are somewhat pathological but this option is provided nonetheless.` what the fuck does pathological even mean here.
Bill: Me: I should take the ferry to enjoy the breeze
Also me: the ferry is 7 dollars versus the 2.50 for the subway
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah thatâ€™s a lot of money
Nokri (Marisa): thundER AHHH

Bill: Most of his bit is about his kids so that's really cute.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is that a comedian? Or something like that
Bill: Ye.
Bill: He's going to be in NYC in October, I need to get tickets actually.
Bill: He's one of my top three comedians.
Bill: My bitmojiâ€™s eyes were green. Why. What?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My dad forgot to pay and drove to the second window at McDonaldâ€™s and then had to back up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which I made fun of him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But one time I paid and they handed me my drink first and I pulled away before getting my actual food
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Huh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Look at my sister's cherry tomato plants

Tikur (Kurtis): Big tomate
Tikur (Kurtis): Unrelated y'all wanna hear a dream I just had
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Big dream tomate
Tikur (Kurtis): I was yoted back through time and became a WW2 B-17 bomber pilot. I then fell in love told her about me being not from that time, and then, like consequentially, the next bombing raid I went on got transported back to modern times but with the plane and then had to land a fucking bomb loaded plane at an airport.  Which was wierd because as I went through time the plane aged and my crew dissapeared so all I was left with was like a barely flying planes and bombs.  I then woke up just thinking fuck, so we got no idea if time traveling mirrior dimension me survived.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sounds like a novel waiting to be written
Tikur (Kurtis): Oh also for some reason I was Macaulay Culkin
Tikur (Kurtis): And yeah it was a neato dream
Tikur (Kurtis): <@245270932602486784> What's this mean in yo dream book

Tikur (Kurtis): Yeah that was a wierd part I only have like one dream part that I could see my face and it was him instead.
Bill: Phone controlled sound system.
Bill: The one speaker I had in my room does not cover the apartment lol
Bill: Laying down was a mistake.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHAT A COOL DREAM
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I donâ€™t have the book on me but itâ€™s probably something about living in the past
