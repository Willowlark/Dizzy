Bill: ? It's not like you can get a frosty anywhere else?
Aldus (Jess): I don't think he knew that that's Wendy's brand name for that since alot of places have something similar

Afina (Georgia🍀): :3c
Afina (Georgia🍀): Speaking of heads, my brain came up with this weird ass dream last night
Afina (Georgia🍀): So it was this freaky dream where my mom sold my truck without telling me, and I got really mad at her and made the house a mess by tearing all the clothes out of drawers and throwing food all over the floor and smashing plates
Afina (Georgia🍀): And dream georgia was just _so ANGER_
Afina (Georgia🍀): I woke up angry

Bill: It's... honestly not surprising...
Afina (Georgia🍀): My self esteem was kinda low yesterday 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no Sarah's asking why I like physics now I have to justify why I like something so many people hate
Bill: 😢
Afina (Georgia🍀): "The only good part of physics is drawing stuff"
Afina (Georgia🍀): orz
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk if that's her personality or she's being funny
Bill: relax, you can't tell from text messages.
Bill: You miss the context of voice, expression, body language in text.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHEEZES I guess
Afina (Georgia🍀): At least none of them are like trap queen shawty
Bill: Yup, no red flags. that's all you have to figure out now. When you move in, then you can start really knowing them.
