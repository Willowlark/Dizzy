Nokri (Marisa): one of our sewing students (in a class that i don't teach, BoJo just always talks about me in that class and spreads exaggerated rumors so now the girl things i'm amazing) just started high school and is trying to make an anime club. she says her teacher is really cool, and runs a board game club and some other vaguely nerdy things. her and the teacher were trying to come up with ideas of what an anime club should do, and they sent me an e-mail asking for advice since i was an anime club president eons ago. one of their ideas was to ask me to come in and give guest lectures each month on stuff like cosplay-making, japanese culture in anime, etc. 🙀 i think she's really overestimatin' me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You are capable of all of thise things
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Now commiting to all that <:thinku:543194478614413318>

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Your mom's not telling lies <:thenflourish:564838295108976680>
Nokri (Marisa): i walk into the room in a kigurumi, face covered in pocky crumbs
little weeblets are staring at me. i give them no pocky that stuff's like $7 a box imported for the good stuff, they have to work for it.
i put a towel on the table so i don't scuff it when i put my feet up
"hey you kids ever hear of uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh picrew"
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): the next hour and a half are spent blasting a cruel angel's thesis while i complain about japanese cosplay changing rooms in an increasingly manic tone
El🆓de Faun (Tom): All of them nod in unison but then get mad because you didn't say itataki masssorry masen when you entered the room, as is weeb ritual
Nokri (Marisa): "be glad you kids weren't alive when pedobear memes were the norm. how old are you all again?"

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How’s everybody doin
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like it’s been 10 years since I’ve been talking here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When in reality it’s been one (1) hurricane

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and birthday
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and apartment
Nokri (Marisa): OH
BTS STANDS FOR BACK TO SCHOOL
I thought Kpop was getting really really popular
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Nokri (Marisa): I saw a friend post pictures of her little kids with #bts under it, and they’re the most average American family ever and I spent quite a while trying to figure out how her kids related to the bangtan boys
Nokri (Marisa): And then. Epiphany.
Aldus Larian (Jess): my cousins best friends mom is like this 60 yr old super christian woman and she obsessed with BTS. Shes always posting abut how hot they are its hilarious
Nokri (Marisa): Omg that’s like the exact opposite of this post
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): like literally everything she posts is about Jesus and scripture and then "Jungkook is a beautiful man with a beautiful voice"
Nokri (Marisa): really those are the only two things ya need in life
Bill: Cardiologist is way busier today. Hopefully I’m not away from work toooo long.
Nokri (Marisa): People like to schedule appointments on Friday or Monday because it extends their weekends
Nokri (Marisa): does anyone know if there are laws for stores that sell food, or any way to potentially report them to some health inspector?

a store we often goes to sells outdated food, but it's normally not too bad. like pasta that expired last year and old candy and whatnot, things that are fine to eat past the expiration date and it's super cheap. but the other day they were selling a product with cheese packets inside that were 2 years old, and they've currently got a sale on cereal that expired in 2015. and cereal takes a long time to expire so i don't wanna know how many years they've had it sitting around in who knows what conditions. they recently got rid of their meat counter which is good, but old cheese and cereal that's potentially like 9 years old... <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): pretty sure that's a major FDA violation
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe submit something to the FDA? Take some pics and send them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): might be able to call the police too? then they could take care of it
Nokri (Marisa): ye, I feel like it breaks some kind of law? but it's dried food so i wasn't sure. ok I'll look them up, their website has to have some kind of contact button
like, the store next to them also sells old candy, but it's not expired. the other day they were selling easter candy but it's still good and not expired. this store just straight up sells expired stuff
Bill: The complain about it and as soon as you do it happens theory holds up!
Bill: Granted they told me it’d be quick Tuesday.
Aldus Larian (Jess): " It is illegal for stores to sell food past its “Use By” date. However, stores are allowed to sell food after it has passed the “Best Until” “Best Before” “Sell By” or “Display Until” dates stamped on the sides of packages. "
Nokri (Marisa): oooo that's probably how they get away with it
Nokri (Marisa): they must've had to get rid of their meats fast because it had a "use by" date, i remember this was the line to the store when they had a meat sale a few years ago lol. my sister filled up her entire chest freezer for under $50
Aldus Larian (Jess): holy shit
Aldus Larian (Jess): is that like their thing? like certain stores only sell old stuff, is it likethat or is it a normal store
Nokri (Marisa): i like reading the reviews

"Ever since the original owner sold the business, about a year ago, this place had been HORRIBLE!!! 

Mostly everything on the shelves and in the freezer cases are outdated. I mentioned to a worker that the ketchup on the shelves were outdated, his response to me was that it was ok because vinegar doesn't go bad. WHAT???

The deli seems to be the only thing that 'may be' viable. I used to shop here every week, now I travel for 1/2 hour for great quality fresh deli meats and cheeses. 

The Board of Health should shut this place down!!!"
Nokri (Marisa): it's a normal store. it's in the berlin mart which has a lot of old stores, it's where the fabric shop we go to and teach at is. the mart as a whole has a very vintage/old feel, but a lot of stores are modernizing and there's no rule saying you have to sell old things.
one review says the only thing that's fresh in the whole store is their pasta salad
Aldus Larian (Jess): yikes
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe something here could help?
https://www.fda.gov/food/guidance-regulation-food-and-dietary-supplements/retail-food-protection
Nokri (Marisa): there's one store that has those quarter machines, like gumball machines, but for playing cards and it still has first generation Pokemon/Yu-Gi-Oh cards in it. and then another store is all As Seen On TV modern stuff
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooooooooooo thank for the link!
Nokri (Marisa): it's a pretty weird place now that i think about it. still has a retro arcade in operation that hasn't been changed in decades, and a video store where you can get VHS tapes as well as new DVDs, and also a brand new store that sells new bathtubs.
Nokri (Marisa): ooo *submit your question to the FDA*
so fancy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She caught lunch!
Nokri (Marisa): well is she gonna share
El🆓de Faun (Tom): RIP HOPPY BOI
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it was a yellowjacket so RIP BUZZY BOI
El🆓de Faun (Tom): GOOD
Nokri (Marisa): <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT IS IT
Nokri (Marisa): CAT FOOD! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): WAIT COME BACK YOU PASSED ME
Nokri (Marisa): Catch me running down the street in oversized pink cosplay pants and half-sewn slippers I HEAR A CAR DOOR OUTSIDE
Nokri (Marisa): DELIVERED BUT I DIDNT HEAR ANYONE OUT FRONT AAA
Nokri (Marisa): Like I heard a car but no footsteps
Nokri (Marisa): Bruh it’s in plain sight. It could get blown away by a strong gust, at least stick the box behind the bush or in the door or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): cat food cans?
Nokri (Marisa): They’re little plastic things
Nokri (Marisa): Tiny and light
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo ok
Nokri (Marisa): Cats love em though
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea thats the gud stuff
Nokri (Marisa): Sylvia gets only the best 😍
Bill: The breeze through the apartment is sooo nice today.
Nokri (Marisa): Oo that’s gonna suck in winter though, start buying insulation while it’s cheaper now
Bill: The windows are open.
Nokri (Marisa): Why? <:wot:604744067883991082>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): to let a nice breeze roll through the apartment! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): But what about people who look in the windows <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: 2nd floor.
Nokri (Marisa): Doesn’t stop ‘em
Nokri (Marisa): Someone cut a hole in our second floor window once
Bill: shutters do.
Nokri (Marisa): Shutters are flimsy
Nokri (Marisa): Get iron bars
Bill: Clearly we should all ban windows?
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah! Or put bars on them and keep them constantly covered with curtains
Bill: You live that life if you want.
Nokri (Marisa): I do
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t necessarily want to but I also don’t want stalkers watching me eat again
Aldus Larian (Jess): It cold today
Bill: All I said was I was enjoying the breeze. Little happy thought for the day.
Bill: It's a bit chilly but if the sun was out this would be the perfect temperature.
Bill: Just needs that little bit of sun kissed warmth.
Nokri (Marisa): Everything you do is the opposite of my common sense, it’s so hard to fathom <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: Yes and you confuse me to no end at times as well. I choose to love you for them and try to understand your world as best I can because of I do love you.
Nokri (Marisa): no u
Nokri (Marisa): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: yes that's what I do.
Bill: Exactly what I said.
Nokri (Marisa): U never told me how many flower hair pins you wanted
Nokri (Marisa): How many u want?
Bill: I have absolutely no use for them.
Nokri (Marisa): You can look pretty!!
Nokri (Marisa): You already look pretty but this would be like Pretty^2
Nokri (Marisa): “Your social security card has been suspended due to... some reasons”
Hehehe spam calls are so creative
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also why not just let people see you?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): As long as you're decent!
Nokri (Marisa): hissss
No one can see me
The neighbors thought BoJo was making up existence for years because I was so elusive. When I started working at the office they were like “...you exist?”
Nokri (Marisa): OH and for the window thing, that was someone literally staring into our window and watching us when we had a restraining order on them
Nokri (Marisa): One of our neighbors is paranoid, she says people are monitoring her and watching her all the time, then she also goes out and stares at everyone and tries to pry into their lives
Nokri (Marisa): We don’t have a restraining order on the neighbor though that’s someone else <:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh yeah of course if you have odd neighbors <:Shooketh_Honda_San:605590718026874901>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And other "people"
Bill: So Dad's internet was a speed of like, 55 mb/s. Mine is 200 mb/s cause different provider.
Bill: I just got to see the change in speed, I downloaded three episodes of an anime in... a minute or two? It'd take like 3-5 at my parents.
Nokri (Marisa): i guess i should get *fiber optic* just like jess's coworker
