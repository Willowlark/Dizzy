Nokri (Marisa): i'm always so nervous to do anything and especially when i get a day off because that n e v e r happens, like i took a day off to do homework today instead of cosplaying in chiba even though a good friend and a bunch of people i vaguely know would be there. but there's this singer who sings in asakusa every month with 2 comedians and i always go and they're always so nice to me and they make me dance with them ;u; it was hot so i gave them cold wipes and they were so happy and they remembered my name i'm shook
and then i go to the bookstore on the way back and the bookstore guy is so nice (i'm super intimidated by the one who's there after noon during the week but the old man on the weekends and in the morning is the greatest), we talked about hair and the hot weather and he gave me pancakes to take home while i read the book ; u ;
