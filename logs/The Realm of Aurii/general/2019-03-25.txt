Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I Insta-unpacked
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mostly cause I needed the suitcase again lol
Andrew: Just got home and i my feet are on fire with every step
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> what was the thing from Starbucks?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Coffee with sugar free cinnamon dolce syrup and then whatever cream/milk and sweetener you like
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh, <@!351471675843411978> you can get the shave butter without a DSC subscription 👍
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh sweet!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah just put it in the "now" box
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): At least I think you should be able to? But if, for whatever reason, it says you need the subscription, let me know and I'll get you a stash
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awesome thanks!
Bill: ,...
Bill: I'm the only one in NYC today.
Bill: For sure I think this time.
Bill: *I could have fucking stayed home*
Bill: I know this is a work thing and is good but *damned* if the wording doesn't make me feel lonely.
Bill: Sheema: I merged all of your changes, we can delete the branch of code from last week.
Me: ....
Me: *checks branches*

The main branch has *none* of the changes, she didn't do standard merge procedure if ANYTHING, and if I deleted that branch I'd have lost a week's worth of work.
Bill: I have no idea what I can even work on till she explains this.
Bill: ~~I brought my hard drive I could go through pictures~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Bill: appreciate my fancy graph.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow
N🆗ri (Marisa): what a fancy graph
Bill: I feel so validated.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its a dragon
Bill: very nice.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): HE MLEM
Bill: why did I dub myself alpha leo again?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not sure
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz you have a need to feel superior
Bill: Oh ye but.
Bill: I think it was cause I was sitting on the table and someone asked why and I said I was alpha leo.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~when it’s really me and Leanna in a trench coat~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): raynas a leo too
Bill: Fight me.
Bill: ~~although I did find that I'm the only male Leo a little amusing. Cause Lions usually have one male in the pack right?~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sometimes two
Bill: ~~what's Hunter~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~speaking of hunter why did he get so offended when i said we wanted to enter the contest together not as a group~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): his birthday is aug 25th
N🆗ri (Marisa): virgoo
Bill: It was an avenue to prove he knows more than you. It's not that he cares (he might but) it's a chance for him to show he's superior.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if he trash talks me to the judges <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): he wont
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nah, he doesnt talk trash really
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the most trash ive heard him talk EVER is that he "doesnt like chocowaffo and just wishes she'd leave him alone"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and thats about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hes harmless
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): just annoying
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Chocowaffo said he bullied her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They both seem kinda ... soft so
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk who started it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nah he showed me his conversation with her
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he asked her to please stop commenting on all his posts and to stop trying to include herself in things hes doing and she got all offended
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like he really wasnt rude about it, which i was surprised by
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he just simply doesnt like her and confronted her about it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): in hopes that she'd give him space
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and then she started blasting emotions on social media and making it more dramatic
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And she blocked him and vagueposted about him
N🆗ri (Marisa): o dear
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mhm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hmhnhnhmhnhmhmmmmmmmm
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lot of nonsense
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so i just yeeted away from that and went "ye you do you, i dont have a problem with either of you"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and he hasnt talked about it since
Bill: Chocowafflo is an attention whore so.
Bill: Don’t blame him.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i respect hunter for being like that, but hes a LOT of a person and comes off really annoying
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can see that. i was really peeved at the messages he was sending me but he was very cordial and not rude or anything. i imagine if choco's emotions were running high in the moment and she acted on them it would cause drama but if she re-read it later it wouldn't be a big deal
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea exactly
Bill: Well, choco would choose to act on them.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea she did and he blocked her so it all ended with that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which is far more respectful than him retaliating
Bill: It’s not the same with you Marisa, if that’s what you’re thinking.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hunter just... my hands are full when I’m around him lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I like hunter, in doses
Bill: Tagging along to the shoots I was trying to understand him a little better so I can be around him better. Do better and all that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but hanging out with him for a full weekend is exhausting
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~*but what if it is*~~
Bill: That’s where the “client” that came from. Tbh I think since you aren’t Instagram popular he doesn’t want to make friends with you.
Bill: He’s looking for the photography/exposure/connection value in friendships.
Bill: That’s going to hurt him later.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's messed up tho. anyone could become the next michael jackson in the future. yeah
N🆗ri (Marisa): why not treat people like people
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nah, i dont think so
Bill: And I say hurt him cause he could alienate friends like that.
Bill: Not right now. But eventually.
Bill: And I’m not saying it’s a conscious choice on his part either, like he’s some bad person who sees people as dollars. He’s trying to find a ground between photography, getting famous, and friendship. That’s hard.
Bill: He’s testing waters and finding lines. It’s a process.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i don't think he dislikes marisa
Bill: Nah. No way.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye. i'm just trying to see it from his eyes, and trying to figure out why he'd totally ignore me while standing right next to me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he has a hard time focusing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and he often ignores half of what im saying
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so i usually have to repeat myself
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which
Bill: If anything he just doesn’t see her. Yeah the focus thing.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont really hold against him because if i repeat he DOES hear me. I just think hes got a lot of ADD type thing going on
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah he’s not good at focusing on others too much, he’s got probably a pretty fast moving brain
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like i really have to grab his attention in order for him to hear me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is why he’s like “8 photos? Shoot is good, we done
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hes like constantly moving around and has a billion things on his mind constantly
Bill: Well, I dunno about the photo part but.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i introduced myself though and he walked away (granted, he was carrying a box so maybe it was heavy and he wanted to go put it down), then the rest of the times i was around if i waved or said hi i was just wholly ignored. feelsbadman.jpg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): which i can relate to
Bill: Subway. Bhubaneswar
Bill: Brian
Bill: Bbiab
N🆗ri (Marisa): eat fresh
N🆗ri (Marisa): u ok
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): does he recognize you?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i know i didnt a few times LMAO
Bill: It can be hard, you a good cosplayer.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I APOLOGIZE IF I IGNORED YOU BTW
N🆗ri (Marisa): NO U DIDN'T U GOOD!!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like the first time you sauid something to me at katsu i was like WHO TF
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but then it clicked
N🆗ri (Marisa): the times he ignored me were like 3 minutes after i introduced myself to him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): just smile and nod 😃
N🆗ri (Marisa): "yeah I know you! yeah! totally!!"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "hi stranger"
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i don't even remember talking to you at katsu oh no wh~~ NO YEAH YOU WERE THE PENNY i think haha whoops hewwo

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and looked around and was like... she with georgia, bill, tom and jess.....this must be.....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): MARISA
Bill: Even I have trouble.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It hard cause not everyone knew what Marisa’s face looked like before she went to japanland
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ye i like only met you as ruby that ONE time at kon kon
N🆗ri (Marisa): i always got the glasses
N🆗ri (Marisa): *how dare u not recognize me after 2 years after seeing me once at a big distracting event for like an hour* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and you look hella different in all your cosplays cause you a good ass cosplayer
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): noo i got that same face syndrome where i always look bad
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i only recognized you on sunday in the dealers hall because you had staff shirt and were pointing at me
N🆗ri (Marisa): sniff out the badness that me!

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was like who is erika but that’s Erik AND andru
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm savin' up for new glasses because the plastic on my current ones is warping so when i get new glasses i won't tell anyone you'll have to guess who i am
N🆗ri (Marisa): you know. erika.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she's right here
N🆗ri (Marisa): [erika voice] i'm right here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You know it was kinda weird that hunter invited me to where he knew my ex would be
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And for more ex weirdness, it was weird that snow re-wore a cosplay to match you Leanna
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt see any of DE squad
Aldus Larian (Jess): i saw lissy for a half asec
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah did anyone see greg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Gasp
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah once with hunter and meg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Very different mannerisms from when he saw me alone at Katsu 👀
Bill: Will not delete when aimed at Mawisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's racist
N🆗ri (Marisa): from you, a furry, to me, a non-furry
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa u funny u make me laugh
N🆗ri (Marisa): did they post anything on instagram. i saw evil meg had posted a blue skinned selfie but she didn't have face paint on and i wondered if she blue'd her face or not
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _evil meg_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah they did casual crit role cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m wondering how I only saw them that one time too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NOT THAT IM NOT GRATeful
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye small con center so chances would've been higher <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Bill: To be fair he doesn’t know how bothered you are by Hal and Meg. Or he assumed they’d have walked off by then.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Meg said bye to me and hunter and when she looked at me I could’ve sworn her eyes said “go did”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maaaaaybe
Bill: Okay I deleted it.
Bill: Better marisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***no u***
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***u delete the wrong***
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia i hope your eyes said "no u"
Bill: I deliberately stepped between you two could you even see their eyes? I should easily be wide enough for them twig people and certainly you, twig person.
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru's a birch tree
Bill: Nah one of those fat Oaks from California.
Bill: Redwoods?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She leaned down to tell hunter goodbye
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like full squat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s been liking my posts again idk man
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was like maybe she neutral
Bill: *Maybe she is*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But Zenkai made that seem like a big N O
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): EYES ARE THE WINDOW TO THE SOUL AND HER EYES SAID GO DIE
Bill: The reason they left is Lissy, not her. So she wasn’t off in a huff.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Their body language was totally tense tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was watchin
Aldus Larian (Jess): she was wearing colored contacts eyes cant say anything when u cant see them
Bill: Well, you immediately got on edge when you saw them. I probably didn’t help by stepping between you and then either.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I thought erik was giving me a weird look friday then i realised it was his contacts
Bill: I don’t think you’ll really know what they feel unless you talk to them yourself. You don’t have to be read for that right now.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _megs tweet tho_
Bill: You don’t ever have to.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm sorry if I looked at you weird Jess 🙈
Bill: HOW dare Erik.
Aldus Larian (Jess): NOOO it was the blue! like i thought u were intensely staring at me but then i realized it was just the color
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Confirmed blue eyes constantly death glare
Bill: Erik’s (in)natural baby blue eyes.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~isn’t it “un”— there u go~~
Bill: Autocorrect.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thanks technology
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof I was so productive this morning now I’m fed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wait, what tweet are you referring to?
Bill: The one about a social group she feels alienated from or some shit. The assumption made was it was about BNE.
Bill: 100% bags posting.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ooooh I thought there was a more recent one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ok but like how could it not be BNE
Bill: She has as many social groups as you do because she’s a social butterfly?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): *one* group chat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Same day she was online discord for a good part of the day and not saying anything in BNE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk fam 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, my paranoia tells me she's probably referring to BNE, but at the same time I don't recall anything being said that would lead her to think things
Bill: She’s never CARED about BNE enough to make a post about it.
Bill: She isn’t online in BNE either, she’s online to any server she actually does things in.
Bill: Which we know at the least there’s a Tyler and Brandon server.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Other than after cosplay ice skating at Georgia's I remember there was gossiping going on. Not sure if ~~Hunter~~ someone said anything to her or if maybe someone had a live stream going and people said stuff... because it was after that weekend she had that story post that only I apparently saw...
N🆗ri (Marisa): If you’re online in one you’re online in all of them though right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah what did that story post say I forgot about that
Bill: That’s my point.
Bill: But I’m not going to argue it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she said "found out recently a lot of 'friends' actually hate me"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ohhhhh yeah thattt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And I was just like 👀👀👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Well hunter told her she couldn’t sit at the table at Applebee’s
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But that was cause he was saving seats for two others friends
Bill: ~~everything is Hunter’s fault~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So hal and meg and Mak and Jordan got bumped to another table
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It wasn’t meant as a zinger to them either, Hunter was legit saving those seats
Bill: They could CERTAINLY have taken that poorly.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BUT they still hang out with hunter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But they're still on good terms with Hunter so I don't think they'd feel that way coming from him
Bill: You mean Hunter begs them for shoots and they agree.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And it was after that that hal was like WHAT RUMORS ARE YOU SPREADING
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I was like boi it ain’t me
Bill: It’s HUNTER. Plus, as he’s active in discord and they’re going to assume that makes him on your side.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I told hal that ethan was spreading the rumors fair and square
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Theoretically that should’ve gotten them off my back but it hasn’t
Bill: They aren’t really on your back.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Meg was super anti georgia the last couple BNE convos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like the time someone tried to claim my cosplay pics were theirs
Bill: That was over 3 or 4 months ago. People move on.
Bill: And there’s a lot of reasons someone can feel unwelcome or lied to.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmmm idk fam
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m not really missin out on anything by being especially cautious around them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s not like I’m losing out on a friendship with hal or meg
Bill: Just causing yourself unnecessary stress in avoiding them and watching stories of people/following people that still hurt you.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My advice would be just not to dwell on it. They're not worth your time thinking about things like that. You live your life and let them live theirs. I know it's easier said than done, but I feel as though you tend to overthink things about them when they shouldn't really matter to you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thaaaat is probably a fair point
Bill: Couldn’t have said it better.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m an over thinker
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We love you and we're here to support you should things ever go awry
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh same here
Bill: It runs in the fam.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hot take yall
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You upgraded to Noah. Don't worry about the previous boi
Aldus Larian (Jess): Most people are overthinkers
Bill: Don’t give yourself fuel, as a start. Mute stories on Instagram, mute profile, and you’ll basically never see them. Same thing for league.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH I haven’t played league
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And ye I did upgrade dis tru
Bill: Wow my parents got invited to stay with jazz musicians from London on their vacation.
Bill: And met actors and shit.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Neat
Bill: They scary.
