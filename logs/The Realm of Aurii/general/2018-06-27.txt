Afina (Georgia🍀): lmao i have so little greek work this week, its the 5th week out of 6 so i think this teacher has like, already given up
Nokri (Marisa): apparently back in the US I got a package from a 'fulfillment center' whose address doesn't show up on google. it had a time sensitive sticker and was filled with anti-slip bath products. no receipt, no packing slip. i never ordered anything what is this
Aldus (Jess): Lul what
Eliran (Halim): Funny thing
Eliran (Halim): I was hanging with a friend I hadn't seen in a while last night
Nokri (Marisa): is there more to the story. this sounds like a suspenseful cliffhanger
Nokri (Marisa): i still can't get over how good the character designs are for the spongebob musical. especially plankton and karen.
Nokri (Marisa): they're like off-brand robbie rotten and kitty powers

Bill: I got the suggestion to wake up early when I work from home and go to the gym before I start working. I woke up an hour and a half ago and immediately said fuck that.
Bill: Too bad tired me I’d never on board with plans.
Nokri (Marisa): That sounds like some of my clients but better
Nokri (Marisa): One goes drinking every single night and the next day he goes to the gym before class to sweat out the alcohol. But most days he oversleeps and doesn’t go to the gym. But he still smells very strongly. I have to like try and circulate the air in my booth in the 3 minutes between lessons to dissipate the smell
Nokri (Marisa): What you have to do is make a Rube Goldberg machine that drops something wet on your face and lights something near your nose on fire. That will wake you up.
Aldus (Jess): People that do to the gym before work in the morning are on the next level
Nokri (Marisa): When I get home I’m making that a meme
Bill: Whoo I should do that.
Aldus (Jess): make a meme or get on the next level?
Nokri (Marisa): yes
Bill: Go out drinking every night, duh.
Aldus (Jess): NO BIRU das bad
Bill: 😏
Nokri (Marisa):

Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): oo i thought this was people from your office at first
Bill: 
Bill: nope, Twitter hashtag.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like I'm not dressed for the science campus right now
Bill: 
Bill: email is sin.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Everyone's walking by in slacks and math tshirts and shit, and I'm in work out clothes and a white gurl bun
Bill: ~~that's because they're all nerd dudes~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel the "talk to people in gifs" one lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mmmm true
Afina (Georgia🍀): A BOOB? ON SCIENCE CAMPUS? Never
Bill: can confirm.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~what's even funnier is I'm probably in a more advanced math than a decent chunk of them~~
Bill: Humble of you to say.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): It tru tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I've gotten the "you're too pretty for a physics major" treatment more than I'd like
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow like half my math class isn't here today is it a holiday?
Bill: Protip, future lonely STEM majors living out of you parent's basement: don't tell the pretty girl she can't be in STEM. Tell her to bring her friends.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH I got hot friends
Aldus (Jess): i hate when guys say that
Elfriede (Tom): <@351471675843411978> I tonight your yanny joke was funny ❤
Aldus (Jess): its basically saying hot girls are dumb and smart girls are ugly and it really just insults all of us
Aldus (Jess): THANKS BABE
Bill: ~~You got hot taken friends anyway~~
Elfriede (Tom): I was like, why is noone laughing at this joke, it's so witty
Bill: what a yanny?
Aldus (Jess): its that stupid sound thing
Elfriede (Tom): Idk what a Laurel is <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Dave: Plz no
Afina (Georgia🍀): ITS LAUREL that's why
Aldus (Jess): its like the blue and black dress vs the gold and white dress thing
Elfriede (Tom): I agree with Georgia, it's yanny
Aldus (Jess): ya your right tom is def laurel
Elfriede (Tom): ❤ ❤ 🙏 🙏
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also my taken friends are still hot, their hotness is not devalued by their taken-ness, so the mean stem dudes can suck an egg
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Bill: the two adjectives are not mutually exclusive, yes.
Aldus (Jess): their taken ciz their SOs didnt say stupid shit like "you're to smart to be pretty" when they met them
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH
Elfriede (Tom): Imagine saying to someone: you're too dumb to be ugly
Elfriede (Tom): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): RIGHT?!
Bill: To be fair, I'm pretty sure a frat guy might say that.
Bill: heh. And by saying it, he's likely proving he's the dumb one.
Aldus (Jess): saying either proves you're dumb
Bill: tru
Aldus (Jess): i saw this girl at the graduation last week and her cap said "Forget beautiful, I'm brilliant!" and im like "uhhh? you're both and what toxic bs said you couldn't be?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): UGH that's the worst
Aldus (Jess): like plz
Bill: Couldn't it be she was snubbing the people who only notice her looks, saying she's more than that?
Aldus (Jess): perhaps
Afina (Georgia🍀): Doesn't come off that way tho
Aldus (Jess): still a problematic thing though. the 2 have nothing to do with each other
Aldus (Jess): ive seen the phrase used before and it usually something people say thats very similar to the "too pretty to be smart"
Bill: _shrugs_
Bill: I have little tolerance for stupidity, so I don't see a lot of these stuff.
Bill: ~~and Rowan had like 3 women CS majors~~
Aldus (Jess): it has nothing to with tolerance though
Bill: I'm not saying it does.
Bill: I'm saying *I* have little tolerance for stupid people who say things like that. So because I don't go around them, I don't see a lot of the issue.
Bill: which doesn't mean it's not an issue, I'm just not well informed.
Bill: I would not recommend that sir, I haven't updated Deviantart in at least 3 years and I never plan to again.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Imagine a men's grad cap saying "forget handsome, IM handy"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Id laugh
Aldus (Jess): LMFAO
Bill: 
Elfriede (Tom): I could actually imagine someone in Sussex tech with a hat like that
Elfriede (Tom): Oof, this year's grads were so gender divided it was scary
Bill: I have no idea how the dry bag works, but it does seal the air.
Aldus (Jess): my coworker was on the phone with our boss and his wife called 3 times (family emeregncy) so i answered his phone for him  but i really hope she didnt think "Why is some girl answering my husbands phone?"
Elfriede (Tom): Nahhhh your talking about Mike?
Aldus (Jess): ye
Aldus (Jess): like i mea i know she didnt after i said who it was, but like i hope she didnt thin that at frist
Afina (Georgia🍀): How is some dude TYPING math notes
Elfriede (Tom): Yooo wuttt
Elfriede (Tom): Oh I bet she did tho
Elfriede (Tom): Would you think that?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~probably~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Doesn't matter tho cause Jess clarified so all is welllll
Bill: I typed some math stuff that would come up in my higher level CS courses.
Bill: I have my surface, so going to written notes was easy.
Afina (Georgia🍀): We doin matrices tho
Bill: but simple stuff I'd type.
Bill: [ 5 6 7 ]
Bill: I had a notebook in linear.
Bill: I think.
Bill: It's been awhile.
Afina (Georgia🍀): He ain't typin
Bill: ~~he probably just fucking around then, cause I did lots of that too~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): He just dickin around I think
Afina (Georgia🍀): This Calc four tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): You can afford to dick around
Elfriede (Tom): Yee3 you can 👌
Elfriede (Tom): Can always dick around in math <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): -_-

Afina (Georgia🍀): Probably lol
Bill: It bothers me too!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Toms just bein a ho

Aldus (Jess): my boss detailed something he wanted done for a flyer in 2 emails but only copied me on one and my coworker with other one is on lunch
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede (Tom): That pretty much. Sums up Bill
Aldus (Jess): ~~what were you typing before that~~
Elfriede (Tom): ?

Elfriede (Tom): I concede that I'm being a ho and will back down  🙏

Elfriede (Tom): I've been to a couple

Afina (Georgia🍀): Hmmm I wonder what I'm thinking of then, maybe LA fitness
Aldus (Jess): yea or gold's gym
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^ my third guess
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just know my friend got too swol so he had to switch gyms lol
Bill: Gold's was kinda athlete heavy.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeaahhhh

Afina (Georgia🍀): A matching water bottle
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe not the yoga pants I don't think that's your preferred work out gear
Aldus (Jess): do u have the 10 or the 20 a month one?
Bill: I'll let you rock the cute pink and black gloves all by yourself, and it'd be a crime for me to wear yoga pants in public.
Bill: 10 dollar.
Bill: No guests for me, I was paying 20 but I don't even go.
Afina (Georgia🍀): You should, it's what ~~Jess and I~~ ALL THE COOL KIDS do 😎😎😎

Aldus (Jess): thats all space is
Aldus (Jess): a giant earth tarp
