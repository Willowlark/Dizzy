Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mark asking about play-by-post
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hue
Bill: Already went over that fiasco.
Bill: Iâ€™m so dead.
Bill: I slept for a hour and a half when I plot on my bed after getting home.
Bill: Would have stayed that way if I wasnâ€™t still dressed and didnâ€™t have my alarm on.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): why aren't hammocks more popular
Bill: Because I doubt thereâ€™s one that can support my weight.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): all of them can yes
Bill: How much do you think I weight smol one.
Bill: Okay fine the first results on amazon are all totally valid.
Bill: Defffffinitely avoid hammocks on principle of not breaking them tho.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): hammock swingset
Bill: Sounds dangerous
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so part of me wants to join a cosplay charity group...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): whats that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like going to hospitals and stuff? or?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like there's one somewhat local one that liked one of my posts a few weeks ago and I checked them out. And yeah they do work with children (which would require getting clearances, but that's not usually difficult).
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like it would be a cool way to do something useful with cosplay and could be a way that it could come up respectfully in a job interview.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The only thing is I'd need a more recognizable cosplay lol. They're looking more for superheros and Disney characters basically. Things kids would easily recognize
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.paheroescoalition.com/about?fbclid=IwAR3F2N8PSqxVvCWUOpuMHU64he0CwW-V0l7QrU0hXmPxmHg-Yvk796OUZWY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah Ive thought about that before too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d like to make a Disney Princess or something lol
Bill: Or spider Gwen.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess sheâ€™s recognizable now yeah
Bill: Any of the spider verse characters would work.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Gwen isnâ€™t THAT recognizable tho
Bill: From spider verse she is.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Honestly any type of Spider suit would just be recognizable as *some* character from the Spider-verse
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not sure if Peter B. Parker would be recognizable enough lol
Bill: Yeaaaah and heâ€™s kinda a deadbeat which isnâ€™t *inspiring* for children. ~~for 20-25 year olds heâ€™s a hero though~~
Bill: For some reason I always feel swagging when I get to IBM. work clothes I guess.
Bill: Spotify put together a good playlist for daily mix, lots of like 20's classics and some edgy stuff for the *edgelord* in me like MCR. 

But there's the occasionally acoustic and I'm like? No thank you?
Bill: Consistent energy level please.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): where's the anime

Bill: and only accessible at Tech.
Bill: Oh wow I do still have it.
