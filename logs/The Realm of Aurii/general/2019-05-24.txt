Nokri (Marisa): custom sizing used to be a thing, now it's mainly for the super rich.
but in days gone by you'd walk into a mall and everything would be made-to-order with your measurements. we have a few old dresses passed down that were bought like that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I get the button thing and my boobs are pretty Ave

Tikur (Kurtis): <@351785752197201920> YIKES
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Big yikes
Nokri (Marisa): omg it's the original script for Holes
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwUSwyPf6LRDZ0NUT2ZLYjRXVFk/view
Nokri (Marisa): apparently the holes movie was suppose to be this:
``` the landscape was all barren not because of a curse but because there‚Äôd been a nuclear apocalypse and subsequent plague, and Stanley went to prison camp not because he stole a pair of shoes but because he mercy-killed his own plague-riddled sister. And Pendanski sneaks the boys out to take them to a truckstop bar and buys them prostitutes. And it‚Äôs revealed at the end that the conspiracy of the camp is that they‚Äôre digging for, not buried treasure, but old nuclear warheads. And there‚Äôs a running theme about how ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt bury the past.‚Äù```
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): THEY WERE GONNA CHANGE HIS NAME TO STANLEY *KRAMERS*?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what the fuck
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also what paper yo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Sounds interesting
Nokri (Marisa): it was a book we were talking about in cosventions a few weeks ago
the author kept saying that male cosplayers call their costumes their "gear" and how women were afraid of men in fandoms because fandoms are safe spaces for women, and if a dude enters then he's going to make everyone uncomfortable and pray on them
