Aldus (Jess): Ooooo inreme I that but I haven't seen anything about a movie
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH!! when I went to the theater the other day they had flyers for a movie but that was the absolute first time i heard anything. crazy
Nokri (Marisa): especially since bnha and yuri on ice movies are so big. osomatsu-san was arguably equally popular
