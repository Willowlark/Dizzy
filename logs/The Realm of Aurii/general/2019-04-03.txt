Aldus Larian (Jess): You speak very cripticaly
Bill: I’m using discord to take notes so I’m not on my phone during the social.
Bill: Which is now over.
Bill: Socials are weird, I’m always worried I’m being too frank.

Aldus Larian (Jess): Wat did it do <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>

Bill: Your twilight days coming back to you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT YEAR IS IT
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>
Bill: I had a dream about a like, 20~30 foot tall Walrus was like, coming up to a guy, from over the fencing in a zoo. The explaination was Walrus's needed to be socialized with a rabbit, cause otherwise they get lonely and need socialize with humans, until they try and realize they aren't the same as humans and get depressed.
Bill: I *really* don't know.
Bill: ```To see a walrus in your dream, signifies protection and your display of dominance in some situation or relationship. You are always on the lookout for anybody who is trying to out-maneuver, out-rank, or out-wit you. Alternatively, the walrus may represent your thick-skin and how you do not let the comments/criticism of others get to you.```
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh wow, I'll be a vampire, let's get edgy kids
Aldus Larian (Jess): you had to go to like the vampire academy to get like officiated as a vampire or someshit
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AMAZING
Bill: Vampire Knight or Chibi Vampire, you decided.
Aldus Larian (Jess): never saw chibi vampire
Bill: it's not chibi vampire.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~and toms not my brother~~
Bill: Oh true.
Bill: Vampire Knight got freaky at the end.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was like the first anime i attempted to watch not on tv but my laptop was so shitty is couldnt play the video
Aldus Larian (Jess): i watched like 3 episodes in the lowest quality possible and then gave up
Bill: I only read that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i liked zero (wowie big surprise there i know)
N🆗ri (Marisa): chibi vampire isn't a vampire school though it's a regular school right
Bill: ye.
Bill: She's the vampire, she actually produces blood cause she's some kind of special queen vampire (she doesn't know that), and gets massive nosebleeds which look like murder scenes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye!! and for whatever reason they changed the name from karin to chibi vampire and made the opening really lewd
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *To see a walrus in your dream, signifies protection and your display of dominance in ~~photography~~ some situation or relationship. You are always on the lookout for ~~Hunter~~ anybody who is trying to out-maneuver, out-rank, or out-wit you. Alternatively, the walrus may represent your thick-skin and how you do not let the comments/criticism of others get to you.*
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO
Bill: iirc Hunter has some sense of... fear? being intimidated? by going against me. Something someone mentioned at somepoint.
