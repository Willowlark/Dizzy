Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you're a #RealMartian! ðŸ˜„
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So my sister sent me a Snapchat of one of the names on her class roster saying "this is an unfortunate name for a high schooler"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the kid's last name is *Woodcock*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I replied and said "what would make it worse is if his first name was *Richard*"
Bill: You are not wrong.
Bill: Iâ€™ve come to a handful of different Starbucks on the route to Armonk (when Iâ€™m running early or entirely exhausted) and they always seem such friendly places.
Bill: The staff greet regulars by name, are not only awake but pleasant... Itâ€™s very nice, Iâ€™d love a local Starbucks like that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): blargh I keep forgetting to try that trick for my insta posts of adding a 1% filter to allegedly boost my reach
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Aaaaa I met the flight director
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Heâ€™s a four time astronaut

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not some dry bureaucrat, definitely a cool dude, I learned a lot from his presentation

Aldus Larian (Jess): THAT SO COOL
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Eyy neeto
Aldus Larian (Jess): I had a dream i was going to cosplay a crayola crayon
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Crayola cosplay group when?
Bill: ~~so rwby~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): wut
Bill: color coordinated cosplay group?
Bill: RWBY has strong color themes?
Aldus Larian (Jess): o so do lots of things tho
Bill: Those keysmart things you linked Erik? the normal one is 22 bucks. The one with a tile inside inside it is 60.
Bill: Buying a tile to go with the normal one nets you around 40~50 bucks.
Bill: Good business plan.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Price of convenience I guess. Either have everything compacted in the same space for $60 or have the extra bulk of a Tile hanging off your Keysmart for $40 ðŸ¤·
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Keysmart pro also includes an LED light and bottle opener, *and* is rechargeable as opposed to replaceable battery of Tile
Bill: You only have the regular one right?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): correct
Bill: Sounds like you want the pro one :3
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm good ~~for now~~
Bill: lol. You were pretty quick to defend it.
Bill: Course, good business plan was meant as a compliment.
Bill: Mark up is good shit.
Bill: *I'm looking at you Marisa*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just my manufacturing brain coming into play
Aldus Larian (Jess): is erik selling key thingys?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no, just endorsing <:pew:543202259085950996>

Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was worried about charging too much for a quote for a customer last week because I bumped the material cost for something to get us to a 40% profit if the customer decided to order it but my boss told me to bump up the labor cost as well and I was like *guess I didn't need to be worried about charging too much...*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): granted, this is a customer my boss doesn't really like dealing with so he likes to overcharge them so they don't order frmo us
Bill: Man they need to port Recettear to switch. I'd replay that.
Bill: Actually since I can play on the couch with the desktop in the living room... ðŸ‘€
Bill: https://picrew.me/image_maker/19573 This one is good for dudes.
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): is that an apple ring? XD
Bill: idk.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *like looking into a fucking mirror*
Aldus Larian (Jess): i try to make <@!351785752197201920>  but all these hairs are too short
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok, I don't have that pointy of a chin, here's the update
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): IT YOU!
Nokri (Marisa): Why you post the same picture twice
Nokri (Marisa): OwO
Nokri (Marisa): I had a dream last night that Iâ€™ve definitely had before but I canâ€™t remember it <:thinku:543194478614413318> imma try and remember
Nokri (Marisa): Famous people and I think you guys were in it? I feel like maybe I had two dreams that were related to each other <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): here me as a boi, with my natural hair color. so just some random dude
Nokri (Marisa): Eyeblow
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Nokri (Marisa): *its coming back to me
kind of*
Nokri (Marisa): I feel like it had a really random cast. Like, people I know combined with Emma from the promised never land and Caspar from three houses and Tom Holland and a few other marvel guys who might be criminals?
Aldus Larian (Jess): sounds lit
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Woo! Good try at least babe!
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Alot of these are hard cuz my eyes are such a defining feature and no one has em
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): On the character creaters
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): And my hair ofc
Aldus Larian (Jess): they had a black option but it was like grey
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I love how you kinda made your cousin babe
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless u mean shape not color
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): I mostly mean my eye shape I guess yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): which one? ~~we're all white and need glasses~~
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): The guy you made is basically Johnny which makes sense
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): That's prob what you'd look like
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): or my brother
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Yeah ofc since they are the same person
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): But Johnny is closer to your asthetic
Aldus Larian (Jess): but then again johnny just looks like the skinnier more artistic version of my brother
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA that
Nokri (Marisa): Johnny bravo
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): YEP
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): WOAH MOMMA
Nokri (Marisa): from what i can piece together of the dream <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
it was a training camp that took place in japan for a week. the first day everybody climbed a mountain, and then we stayed in a traditional house somewhere on the mountain. there was a general store nearby that most people went to for dinner. i didn't find out about it until 9pm, and then i had to look up directions on my phone but my phone was dead and it took 40 minutes to come back on but the store closed at 10pm so i was a little upset. i tried going there anyway and it was closed, but a ton of fireworks started in the sky and lasted for like a minute.
Nokri (Marisa): everyone was a little confused because there was no itinerary so no one knew what was going to happen during the week. on the second or third day, we took the shinkansen to kyoto where we were put in a big building and made to watch a video of an obstacle course. we then had to complete that course in the fastest time possible, and if you were too slow you would die. you might also die if you were careless. it was kind of Saw-like. the first room was taking pictures of items and books, then there was a stealth area? in one of the final areas you had to sprint as fast as possible across a hallway and then climb the opposite wall, which was a maze going upwards. there were a bunch of famous actors to catch you and attempt to kill you as you tried to cross.

i somehow made it through and then i don't really remember the rest. that's the dream i had before though. in the second dream my mother and i were sitting in the car outside of my hebrew school trying to fumigate one of the actor's blood because we thought he was a murderer or something? i can't remember why. but cops were suspicious of us and kept asking us question right as we were about to prove he was a murderer, and i was trying to ask them how civilians could submit evidence of a crime if there was no open case. one of the cops stuck her finger in the fumigation juice or whatever though and had to go wash her hands, which made the second cop really really suspicious of us. that's all i recall <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Nokri (Marisa): the moral of the dream is it's really hard to collect blood samples from carpeting
Nokri (Marisa): because the actor skinned his knee while chasing after someone in the obstacle course and somehow that blood could prove he's guilty. or something.
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): WOA
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): Complicated
Nokri (Marisa): according to his instagram, andrew hussie left an autographed box filled with toblerones here in california
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): ONGGG
ElðŸ†“de Faun (Tom): That's honestly amazing
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33028196550.html?spm=a2g0o.13151936.7112817700.2.253ea3ceSX9ioM&scm=1007.25281.132557.0&scm_id=1007.25281.132557.0&scm-url=1007.25281.132557.0&pvid=6a67b9be-6259-49d3-bc41-59a2d56dd2d9
