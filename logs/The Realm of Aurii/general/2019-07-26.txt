Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I went through my old Instagram account and scrolled through for a bit and seeing people I haven't talked to in ages, seeing what they're up to now. I made a kind of sappy story post talking about how people are starting to get married and have kids, some are doctors and nurses, and some are still hanging out with their childhood friends and I wanted to throw some love and good vibes to everyone and hoping they're living their best lives and whatnot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Someone from college responded to it hoping all was well with me too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She was a girl I always through was super attractive (still do), but I think the only time we talked in person was one time sophomore year in the laundry room of our dorm lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She's married now so it's not like it was an opening for anything, but still made me feel good lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aww yay!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Compliments from married people are indeed still valid!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but funnily enough, her name is Erica lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao nice
