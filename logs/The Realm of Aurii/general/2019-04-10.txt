Can I share your art of Sona to my RWBY team? I'm not sure if you were done with it or not but I'm ***doki doki***.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YES OU CAN I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY AND IT'S NEARLY DONE I PROMISE
N🆗ri (Marisa): LEMME GET
it's those hands man
Bill: hands are the devil.
Bill: NSFW for scary bad: This was all I could do after... god, like 3 years of practicing?
Bill: ~~literally anything you could do is better~~
Bill: wow thank god I found photography.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a great hand
i'm the worst person ever aterhtj i'm so sorry. it's been what like 5 months. rtshtd
this is the outline and coloring so far ~~I may redo that shirt outline~~~ but the preliminary outlines are done for both of them aside from the hands. they're just too sketchy to be the main drawing so i gotta trace it.
I can throw in some more color if you want for your rwby group, or i can provide the rough sketch. i didn't add the patch yet i haven't forgotten about that.
Bill: you take your time.
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is why commissions are scary there's so much pressure <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: They can wait.
Bill: omh those hands are fantastic.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo GOOD HANDS
Bill: Don't the artist's OCD fool you.
Bill: WOW Marisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they are BAD HANDS and MUST BE RE HANDED
Bill: I patiently await you to continue your magic 🙏
N🆗ri (Marisa): I SHALL my computer updated for some random update last night so the software was closed but usually i keep the file open in the background of everything
Bill: WOO
Bill: Marisa admitted her art is magical!
N🆗ri (Marisa): in that i'll be jobless and living under a bridge because of it yes <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i decide to pursue it as a career despite years' of my parents warning me and forbidding me from having magicians at parties <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): but did i listen? no i ran off to magician's school. it wasn't hogwarts, but it was magical all right <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: that has nothing to do with your art skills.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's where in my sophomore year i met them. what a glorious moment it was, one i shall never forget for the res<:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): magic <:pew:543202259085950996>

Aldus Larian (Jess): <@386874959009415170> <@334090409389195266>  you guys getting dem firefly tickets tonight? 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I will if you guys will
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEET
Aldus Larian (Jess): Should I get Saturday or any day?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think we're set on going Saturday but in case that changes for some reason I'd say get any day to be safe
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2019/first-image-of-a-black-hole-6224607435030528-law.gif
N🆗ri (Marisa): rip google
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow that was quick
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok i got da ticket
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do they check ID? Cuz i logged in with facebook so it put my married name automatically
Bill: > Me, stops laying in bed and gets laptop to be productive
> phone: *Mystic messenger ding*
> Me: "Fuck"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think so. Passes get sent in the mail
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh I'll buy mine now
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mine says print at home <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oooh then maybe the day passes are just print at home
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa not really sure what to do
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ```Emailed tickets can be redeemed simply by bringing your ID, credit card used and Print at Home Ticket to the event.```
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye i emailed them to make sure it wont be a problem
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok looks like the Any Day passes are print-at-home
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I got mine and then went to see what happens if you select a specific day pass and those get mailed
Aldus Larian (Jess): Huh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And doesn't look like you need to pay for parking either. The parking pass is just for overnight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I remember I had a parking pass last time because we were going to take two cars down and then when we didn't go together I didn't need it but parked at the race track on Sunday after packing up and didn't need to pay anything
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which now, two years later, makes sense as to why I didn't have to pay or get my parking pass checked
Aldus Larian (Jess): MOOSAC
