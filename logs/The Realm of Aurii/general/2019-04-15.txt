N🆗ri (Marisa): I DIDNT MEAN TO NOT SAY GOODBYE TO LEANNA AND GEORGIA I was like “lol why are all these nerds just standing there not doing anything” and then they caught up and you and Georgia were gone and I was like <:woah:543194447345876998> *it all makes sense now*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA ME TOO 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): We say proper bye next time 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL me and georgia were like  "guess they left"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): If we didn’t say goodbye we’re still technically hanging out right now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we're all astral projecting to hang out together right now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that sounds exhausting, maybe thats why we all so dead
Aldus Larian (Jess): we partied all night
N🆗ri (Marisa): Astral projecting one image every 30 minutes and the image is flickering and appears to be in pain
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooo there’s a video of flora on stage at the cosplay showcase
Ooooooo dan hosted the cosplay showcase oops. When I saw him I was like “did you see the showcase” and he was like “ya” he didn’t say he rAN IT
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Best cryptid from the weekend

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Weeb stares into morning space --circa 2019 colorized
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh yeah! I Meant to say bye too but I didn't realize either!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Followed immediately by a neck-cracking head turn and a “vween” sound effect
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok everyone we have to go back to say bye

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nice SCP
Elfriede Faun (Tom): O don't remember the number

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll just do it the old fashioned way
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/d/d2/707_Sticker_02.gif
Bill: Like, I could put them as dizzy but they all need unique text names.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you could do it like the random ones in bne where you just ask dizzy something like "dizzy, whats the mood?"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and a random MM emoji
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: But then how can I seven react to everything.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~make them all 7~~

N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh yeah wow. There goes Notre Dame.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its really sad 😦
N🆗ri (Marisa): What do you thinks gonna happen to the poor person who started it
Bill: Yeah I had the same thought.
Bill: That's a... hell of a thing to live with.
Aldus Larian (Jess): was it a person?
N🆗ri (Marisa): No legal punishment basis probably (though French prisons are notoriously some of the worst in the world~)
Might commit suicide like the guy who accidentally killed the rare bunny
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah they think it was from a construction accident
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): they haven't confirmed exactly how it started
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but there's speculation whether it was a result of something going on with the renovation
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah if it was a person who started it, whether purposely or by accident, I can't imagine living with that guilt
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it was from a 6.5 billion dollar restoration project possibly
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause there were people up there for that purpose
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so those people gonna get mega sued
N🆗ri (Marisa): most of the older parts were wood, it could've been an unavoidable thing where someone starting a power tool accidentally sparked something and it just spread before they could control it
N🆗ri (Marisa): CNN is saying likelihood of the stained glass surviving is very low
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ugh thats so sad
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😦
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _850 year old glass_
Aldus Larian (Jess): this is seriously so sad
N🆗ri (Marisa): they were already renovating it, so how much of the building was original? the stained glass obviously, but if those manage to survive they can rebuild it. it's mostly the relics inside that are irreplaceable right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's already a "2019 fire" section on the wikipedia page lol oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): it says some of the glass has already been replaced before since they were damaged by bullets
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): apparently the spire has been rebuilt before
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's good then
it'll be rebuilt again
a lot of old japanese shrines aren't wholly original, they get rebuilt/restored every few decades because there's no way they can survive that long
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :(
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oof the wiki page put "(formerly)" next to the spire height
N🆗ri (Marisa): people are saying this is probably the french 9/11 but i don't think so. how many people were in the church? I heard tourists weren't allowed near the area the fire started, so if the construction crew and church members escaped then no casualties? plus there was a lot of uncertainty during 9/11 because we were under attack so the entire country was on high alert
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's night now that's gonna make fighting the fire so much harder
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the visitor hours ended before the fire started year
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean it's definitely a significant event but I wouldn't put it on the level of 9/11 because it's not an attack
Bill: ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the statues of the apostles and evangelists were removed prior to the renovation so at least those survived
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah i would say the paris attacks of 3 years ago were probably more comparable
N🆗ri (Marisa): there were already lights around the cathedral to light it up at night right? for aesthetic? i think i remember seeing video of people dancing with the cathedral in the background and it was all lit up
those'll really help the firefighters
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): unless the circuits for the lights have been fried
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): somehow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): this is like if the statue of liberty burned tbh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats probably the most comparabl
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah an iconic landmark
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the news report from the livestream I'm watching ended and now its just live footage of the church burning in the distance, wind blowing into the microphone, and it's really eery
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s some horror fuel right there
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): i shouldn't find humor in this tragedy but the camera people must be packed in tightly among the onlookers because they switched to a new reporter and the camera was so close you could only see like 1/3 of his face
N🆗ri (Marisa): "saving notre dame is not certain" big oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was depressing to hear one of the eyewitnesses basically saying it looks as though the flames have gone down, but that's because there's not much left
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :(
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The sad stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): woah WHAT exCUSE ME??
Aldus Larian (Jess): DAMN
Aldus Larian (Jess): seems a little forward but ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just want to look at little plastic ice cream cones that cost four cents pls no
Aldus Larian (Jess): "I want ice cream, not sex damnit!"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WELL THIS IS PROVING TO BE INTERESTING
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And last but not least
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was trying to think of how to answer that, i think biru introduced us at otakon in the game room?
all i remember is "that game looks really difficult but it's got a good vocaloid song on it" 🙀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh mega yikes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh no
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~wait are those responses bad~~
Bill: ~~I thought Reiley was cuter than you when we first first met~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH THAT LAST ONE is that whatshisface
N🆗ri (Marisa): brb
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH NO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Chocowaffo being herself, Ethan being himself, and the Zenkai guy being cringe
Tikur (Kurtis): Yikes
Bill: What a trip.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao when reiley was wearing my Weiss bill?
N🆗ri (Marisa): did he misspell berserker or did he mean beserker
"berserker is one of a class of legendary norse warriors who fought frenzied and shirtless regardless of wounds"
<:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Ye.
Bill: I didn’t register you guys much at Zenkai though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): reiley was the god tier dave at kogara?
Bill: Gen and Rob were the standouts to. E.
Bill: Ye.
Bill: I think.
N🆗ri (Marisa): my savior
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Ha. I was like, obsessed with trying to remember you, Hal and Rei’s name.
Bill: Pretty sure I fucked up yours but managed to remember Hal.
Bill: That’s a reaaaally long time ago.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t remember you fucking up my name lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So it must not have been that bad
Bill: Do you remember that far back at all? XD
Bill: I’m the one with the obsessive memory.
Bill: So I was attributing to that.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think we first met at kogara? And my first reaction was holy shit your eyes are so blue  and you have such a good face for Weiss
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ah yes, I remember when I first met... *~looks at smudged writing on hand~* *...Gloria*
Bill: Lol I definitely mucked up someone’s. I’m still bad with names, faces are easier.
Bill: A sign I would turn out to be a good photographer.
N🆗ri (Marisa): save that line for your biography
Bill: You know, I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction as good as the reaction to the Saturday Zenkai album.
Bill: It totally blew my mind.
Bill: Given it was my first real gallery as a photographer.
Bill: Granted it was posted to Facebook and it was before all the rwbyies knew each other so the event page mattered more.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah and most people came to the shoot wondering if theyd see the photos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so to see ALL of them was like DAYUM SON
Bill: It did the trick, it got me involved in the community. Bless rwby for being so friendly as a community.
Bill: And then...
N🆗ri (Marisa): you know what other community is like that?
Bill: 
Bill: The OG.
N🆗ri (Marisa): **h o m e s t u c k**
Bill: *i spent an entire day trying to figure out how to answer that*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): me, crashing through the walk like hulk: HAY MAN YOU WANNA MAKE SOME ART
Bill: Something like that.
Bill: Bet you didn’t expect us to become so close from that shoot request either.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH REALLY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause before that i had shot with claire regularly at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but otherwise had gotten photos just with friends all rotating through with their cell phones
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): or photographers who advertised, i tried out, and wasnt crazy about
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so lowkey i was glad i didnt have to brace myself for disappointment
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause i liked how the rwby shoot photos came out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and now here we are, almost two years later ✨
Bill: I meaaaaant friendship rather than photos buttttt also true. 😛
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i mean friendship fell out from what was originally me messaging like "Hey this dude seems not creep and doesnt good shit"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then the clicking really came in the weeks after with that facebook messenger group you me and hal had
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GOSH I REMEMBER THAT TOO hal and i were on call and about to go to bed cause i had work the next day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then you dropped the link in so we RECALLED each other to scream about photos
Bill: I'm saying neither of us could have predicted clicking as well as we did from just a photoshoot request. I can't see something working out quite so well that often. ☺
Bill: Ye I'll never forget that 2am chat.
Bill: ~~sorry MM~~
Bill: OH NO the cover image shot was *Dutchess* for that shoottttt xD
Bill: *holy shit these are terrible 😂*
Bill: SO   much contrast!
Bill: Oh man this is when Chris was with Dutchess.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): EWWW
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Duchessssss
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yikes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Do a comparison photo lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Why did Hal's V4 Jaune from back then look better than his V1 Jaune now?*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _who knows man, I think V4 happened before hal because a party boi_
Bill: ~~there are like 3 couples that aren't a thing anymore in this gallery~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Nothing lasts, unfortunately. 🤷
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also, Chris was with Duchess? 😬
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Isnt she like 17
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think she's finally 18
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, *that was 2 years ago*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Big yikes
Bill: He's pretty young compared to Gen.
Bill: Easy to forget.
Bill: ~~But Dutchess was Roman cosplay sexual so~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yikes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s still yikes dayum
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It never ends
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): The yikes goes on and on my friends
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): how old is Chris?
Bill: anyway, if you told me Georgia would become a close friend back then, I would have laughed. Happy it's not that case but. I would have.
Bill: Uh, 21, 22?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah Chris is not too too much older than dutchess
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He's def like 5 years under Gen
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm pretty sure Gen is our age?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah I think she's 26
Aldus Larian (Jess): Facebook say 25
Aldus Larian (Jess): Precisly 5 days older than me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i think chris is 21
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): hes older than me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh OC guy's OC account followed me too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh I saw that art earlier it actually made me sadder oof
Elfriede Faun (Tom): QUAZZI MOTO NOO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): space tech meeting is interesting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): theres a big diversity of people here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): theres nerdy guys and a sorority girl and a bunch of stuff
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and they have individual projects
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): theyre working on a weather balloon programmed with raspberry pi
Bill: Sounds like my internship.
Bill: ASRC did stuff like that.
Bill: What’s this about? Something new?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and building a 9K dollar rocket to try to reach the karman line (where space begins_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): noah has a friend thats head of a space tech club
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WELL FULL STORY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so the space tech club was tryna get an astronaut to come give a talk, but they couldnt come up with the funding
Bill: Unsurprising.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BUT geek week has a huge ass (30K) budget
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and im on the planning committee
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so if i convince the head of the committee, geek week will pay for it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so noah told his friend, the president of space tech club
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and president was like BRING HER TO A MEETING DUDE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and now i am here
Bill: 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so the club (STAR) coordinates individual space projects that people work on for the year, and then present
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i could join for next year
Bill: Was this attempt at getting funding discussed from the start...?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but theyre also recruiting for the summer, which is a good cause i may not have an internship this summer ahhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): STAR is small, they wanted more bodies first
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but then i added that i could help with the astronaut project
Bill: That’s good. I’d judge them if they were only interested cause of the funding.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye everyone was very welcoming and telling me about their projects and asking if i wanted to join first
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and then i told prez that i had _connections_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): as in noah told them i have connections cause im shy
Bill: You aren’t that shy...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _cosplay gives me confidence, im more shy out of it_
Bill: Sounds like a good thing to do for the summer though.
Bill: You’re confident even outside that... At least when I see you.
