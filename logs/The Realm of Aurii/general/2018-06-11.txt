Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs really freaky seeing friends I introduced to other friends hanging out with each other. 
Like y‚Äôall with flora and meg. Freaky. I saw on Facebook Alyssa liked a post from flora. My brain automatically goes ‚Äúhow do these people know each other‚Äù even though I‚Äôm the one that introduced them. It‚Äôs so alien. So strange.
Nokri (Marisa): Even family members sometimes like I see a member of one family talking to a member of another family and it‚Äôs like. Watching an old Cartoon Network crossover episode like the knd and billy and Mandy special.
Bill: Never hung with Meg, if it helps. I did chat with Flora for awhile Friday night.

Aldus (Jess): YOOO THATS GREAT
Bill: I know what's it's fooooorrrrrrr.

Bill: So varied and potential crazy, unlike the cult of Lady Whoozica.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): PO boxes are an extra step of security, so yeah neither do i LOL
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): THE CULT OF LADY WHOOZICA
Aldus (Jess): they are also potentially crazy XD
Aldus (Jess): *gets a po box*
Bill: also correct.
Bill: I dunno, you do you obviously, but I find the whole thing sketch personally.
Aldus (Jess): i thought cosplaying boys would make my male followers unfollow but apparently it just makes them wanna make me a cult leader
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): what a pleasant turn of events
Aldus (Jess): "pleasant"
Bill: Please don‚Äôt get as famous as Georgia, my poor heart.
Aldus (Jess): i've got while to go before that happens

Bill: *I worry*
Aldus (Jess): y tho
Bill: *Im a Defender personality type, it‚Äôs what I do*
Aldus (Jess): wait are you worrying about me getting popular? or getting creeped on?
Bill: The creep aspect. I 100% support followers and stuff, though if you get fake or start putting your self esteem in the hands of your follower count I‚Äôll call you out on it.
Aldus (Jess): get fake nah but my self esteem is fine china
Bill: So you‚Äôll get a talking to in that case.
Aldus (Jess): YOUR NOT MY REAL DAD
Bill: It‚Äôs the side effects I worry about.
Bill: Nah, but my second motto is ‚ÄúI care about me and mine‚Äù.
Bill: Which comes with some protective instincts.
Aldus (Jess): well we've got a tome to worry about that im not even at 500 yet
Bill: I thought you said you have a Tom and i was going to be like ‚Äúye, he gots the hammer now‚Äù
Aldus (Jess): oh whoops XD

Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): I mean it could be allergies but know who's
Bill: Then get berry or whatever.
Bill: Ain't having them for the flavor.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): They make that?
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Yeahhhhh
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Any kind of vitamin c booster would probably be just as good
Bill: Sure, just something to help kick it.
Bill: You got too much to do for a cold.
