Bill: Sweet lights is over fucking crowded man. Decidedly less fun.
Bill: And they don’t change this shit much, I wouldn’t be torn up to have skipped a year.
Bill: Also we’re at 17 years here. Which may or may not make us the longest recurring guests of the lodge.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah probably
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): It’s so crowded that the guys bathroom has a line down the hallway
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Holy jeezo
Bill: Should be asleep.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): fuk sleep
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Help I think I accidentally bought undertale porn
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): That’s the potential low point but as a high point I met the real Nabeshin and 96neko and one of the 96neko duo told me to have a happy new year so that was nice.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): ooo don't know who they are but you do and that's what matters
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 👌 👌
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): *you don’t know who they are!?*
96neko is a famous singing duo, they do a lot of really good vocaloid covers 
Nabeshin is......... just famous idk how but he’s in a lot of older anime like Nerima Daikon Brothers, Excel Saga, I’m pretty sure at least one episode of lucky star? He’s a real person with an Afro and a red suit that just shows up in anime sometimes.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): OH
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): He's a legend, I see I see
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Yee
And 96neko is so nice. They personally took time to thank all their fans who bought their merchandise.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’ve been waiting in line to cross the street for 15 minutes and I’m nowhere near close to crossing ;;
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 😱 😱 😱 oh noooo
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): [distant anime girl shout echoing on the breeze]
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That sounds like a great time
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Anime ambience
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ok!! I can cross the street soon!!

the lady with the dr who merch booth is always really nice. she usually gets a prime spot at zenkai and she's offered us free badges to other cons before. shoutout to the drama around rainbow flag yaoi doujin guy who lost all his customers after wearing wwii military uniforms. that's acceptable in japan but not the US <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Wow I can’t believe everyone is dead. So quiet. 
Literally everything is closed on New Year’s Day here, my friend wants to camp out for Pokémon fukubukuro but I don’t want to sit in the cold for 6 hours for a blind bag even if it’s really good, so I’ll be home avoiding the 3 million people outside going to sensouji for hatsumode. If you guys do jackbox at the New Years party I can spectate in the audience or if you have questions about what 2019 is like before midnight I can tell you if the world still exists or not.
Bill: Call in!
Bill: *my parents are pretty bad about sharing hotel room space. 

Coming from the guy who shares rooms with 5 cosplayers*
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’d like to call in but I don’t want to bother people if somethin is going on
Invite parents to katsucon to fill room space
Bill: I need to plan a trip down here in the spring or summer, preferably not on a con weekend. If anyone with a compooper wants to spitball a relatively quiet time in the circuit me love you long time. 

I’d like to visit the gardens when the flowers are in bloom, the park, zoo... lot here that isn’t worth doing in the winter.
Bill: ~~also talked about doing a meetup here for BNE over some weekend, plenty to photo~~
Bill: ~~they have a big convention center, need to be Chococon, the anime candy convention~~

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): The package is the wrapping?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Just making sure cause I’m setting up the gifts now owo
