Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Thank
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yeah that's my main thought, i might die
also someone made a meme about cosplayers who forgot to buy tickets for tomorrow it's hilarious
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): it's a lot shorter than going to japan but it's still around 19 hours of travel if everything goes well
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh it's shorter than going to Japan?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Is that because of the wind currents and the Earth's rotation?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Or maybe because of arbitrary routes made by people 🤔
Bill: No what TIME.
Bill: They give you an arrival time right?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): OwO 
Ya there’s a time
Yeah it’s shorter by a few hours because it’s going with the rotation of the earth instead of against it. Same route. Time will basically stay the same as we travel so I leave at 6:10pm, get to Michigan and leave for Philly at 6:03pm. Freaky right. 
Assuming nothing is delayed I’ll be at Philly around 8ish
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Or wait. Opposite about the rotation thing.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Earth is going one way and we’re going the other so it’s quicker when going from japan to the us.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Takes longer when earth is going the same direction
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's so wierdddd
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): So you leave at night and arrive at night
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): With no day
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But wait
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): The earth is flat tho so that's Impossible
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Valid
I leave at 6:10pm on 1/11 and arrive at like 4:50pm 1/11 in Michigan so I get to experience 5:00 twice
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 😱 😱 😱 😱
Bill: Mattress saleswoman be pushy as Fuck.
Bill: She surprised I didn’t want to put a deposit or buy the thing right now. 

Even if I wasn’t going to price shop else where, you’ve been making comments about “oh how cute he’s going to fall right asleep” to the couple (bleh) shopping. I’m a quarter century old and more than capable of buying out 4 mattresses, don’t act like I’m 12.
Bill: Holy shit there are cars EVERYWHERE at unique.
Bill: This camera show must be big.
Bill: I impulse bought a lens.
Bill: 50mm full frame prime, 1.8 aperture. Effective aperture 75mm on my camera.
Bill: Good portrait lens.
Bill: ~~I wasn’t going to buy it because I haven’t been doing much portrait/cosplay but I got swept up in the show and it was under 200~~
Bill: ~~oh good it has rave reviews I never looked~~
Bill: So many kids in ikea. What the heck.
Bill: Bless noise canceling headphones.
