El🆓de Faun (Tom): WHAT A KAWAII MORNING
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm jk it still looks like shit outside for the 6th consecutive day
Bill: truuuuuu
Bill: How hard would it be. To find something. That Anna isn't somehow planning a cosplay for.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): very
El🆓de Faun (Tom): As likely as it is for Mufasa to be alive.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think watching so much Brooklyn 99 is getting in my head
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I had a dream where I made out with this kid that I had a lot of flirtatious tension with in high school but never dated
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _just like my B99 ship has so much sexual tension_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://giphy.com/gifs/guitar-and-all-JHTke9umzgZgY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _that was my reaction to this dream yes_
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): oh the stitches do look so much better when they’re uniform
Bill: Do you cross stitch?
Nokri (Marisa): I’ve been anxiety crafting
I have many open projects now, none of which are close to completion and of which I switch between every 5-10 minutes. They’re stuff like sewing, cross stitching, embroidery, knitting, drawing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats good though! glad to hear you are keeping busy
Nokri (Marisa): I haven’t gotten very far
Bill: I know it's from stress but that sounds impressive.
Nokri (Marisa): It’s like keeping 500 chrome tabs open but irl
Aldus Larian (Jess): cute!
Bill: https://media.giphy.com/media/OF3eWzIpEOLcc/giphy.gif
Bill: Like that but with sewing.
Nokri (Marisa): Shiny hunting in let’s go is one of them yeah my switch is here
Nokri (Marisa): making many tiny versions of me on this website is another
https://picrew.me/
Bill: Oh this looks cool but difficult due to Japanese.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea thats the one that peoplehave been doing on tumblr i think
Nokri (Marisa): click on any creator
click あそぶ in red on the bottom right to play (it's not a terms and conditions or anything, it's information about the maker and its creator and how many items it has and whatnot)
go through the menus, you can change the color by clicking the paint brush or somethings there are more hidden items under different colors
when you're done click 完成 in the green box
you can download it by pressing ダウンロード on the next page
Nokri (Marisa): yee
Bill: These are so oddly specific but they're cute so it's okay.
Nokri (Marisa): it's me
Aldus Larian (Jess): a whole meal! i.e. not *just* a snack, but much much more!
Nokri (Marisa): there was an article about a curry cooker the other day and how it made cooking curry so much faster and easier because you could pop it in the microwave for 5 minutes
but you still had to chop and slice all the vegetables and ingredients and make the rice separately
so at that point you might as well just cook it normally on the stove since the cutting/chopping is 95% of the work
Bill: But also a snacc <:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Curry?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I wan curry
Tikur (Kurtis): Same
Bill: Jeezus I want to quickly pick up my car from the shop, not stop to talk to a random fucking landscaper my mom sees in the development.
Bill: true happiness is finding the perfect meme template to express your negative thoughts. 👌
Bill: Almost did a `:3` instead of `:)` on a work message OOP
Kaio Vermino (Lee): :3c
Bill: So whose going to endgame for another round to see the 6 minute bonus footage.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you fuckin' betcha
Tikur (Kurtis): Hell yeah
Andrew: Just got a flood warning and everyone's phone was going off in the store
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same!
Tikur (Kurtis): Your sacrifices will be remembered
