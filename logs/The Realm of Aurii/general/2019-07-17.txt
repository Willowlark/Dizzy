Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg I did the FaceApp thing where it makes you an old person
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Never have I feared getting old more than now
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I saw a picture of someone who processed a picture of themselves through that like 14 times and it is horrifying

Aldus Larian (Jess): Nightmare fuel
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So apparently I woke up last night with a nosebleed and managed to take care of it without getting blood on anything 1) while half asleep and 2) blind without my glasses
Aldus Larian (Jess): do you have superpowers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): After I woke up I thought I dreamed it until I saw the bloody tissues in the bathroom trash can (which, mind you, is on the 1st floor and my room is on the 2nd, so I also had to navigate 12 steps to get down, half asleep, blind, and bleeding)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Idk man
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it's all just muscle memory from how often I get nosebleeds lol
Nokri (Marisa): A-are you dying

Aldus Larian (Jess): 4-7? maybe?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 5:37pm
Nokri (Marisa): I always figured evening started at like 5-6 or when the sun starts going down in winter. 
A girl inquired about my evening shoots so I told her any time after 5:30 but she said she wanted something before 5 <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Aldus Larian (Jess): U NOT WRONG
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That Thot is wrong!
Nokri (Marisa): Yee, id consider 8:00 night so I figured I‚Äôd offer shoots from 5:30-8 so I put evening
She specifically said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like one of your evening shoots‚Äù and then was like ‚Äúgotta be before 5pm‚Äù
Nokri (Marisa): Can‚Äôt believe everything I know is incorrect and I‚Äôm wrong
Nokri (Marisa): Petition to officially define hours for evening and create a global standard
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 5am-8am I would consider "early morning"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): irrelevant, but adding onto Georgia's time scale (which I otherwise agree with)
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah in the sims GBA you woke up at 5am and that was considered morning
Nokri (Marisa): *the sims bustin out*
