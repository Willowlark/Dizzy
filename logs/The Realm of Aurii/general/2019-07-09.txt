Nokri (Marisa): im gonna reread this disaster textbook again
it's easy enough that i can read it while sewing or attempting to exercise, interesting enough that i won't get bored, and also bojo wants me to go for a job in disaster preparation after i absolutely tore into the office's disaster preparedness plan for our community. it was awful.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): GIID
Nokri (Marisa): the only good thing they had going was a deal with a local hospital which, in the case of an energy like a multi-day blackout (which happened a couple of years ago, we lost power for like a week), they would send a team of nurses over to provide medicine and medical equipment for anyone who needed it and couldn't leave their house (like heart monitors or things that require electricity to charge that wouldn't be available during a blackout).

they set the office as a shelter for those instances but they don't have a generator or any sort of cooling plan should the power go off during the summer. they have a very basic first aid kit there but no blankets or any way to get info out in an easy manner and TLDR IT SUCKED AND ONLY REALLY 'PREPARED' FOR A LONG TERM BLACKOUT
Nokri (Marisa): UGUU
Nokri (Marisa): Not even a hierarchy of who’d be in charge smh that’s how we get big fighting

Nokri (Marisa): kurtis what did you do to warrant that cop and ambulance
Nokri (Marisa): i'm so aware that in high school it took me like 6 months to realize the girl next to me in english who i was good friends with and the girl next to me in gym who i spoke to every day was the same person

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Learn to sew
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's super intimidating but as long as your machine functions it's not too bad
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Just use a pattern is my big recommendation esp for beginners like us
Andrew: 
Bill: accurate.
Andrew: oh tom youre learning too?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I sewed briefly in middle school but my first project I sewed since was my leo jacket
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And boi was that a time
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And small stuff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah sewing machines, as long as they are running properly, are pretty easy to use! Only really need straight stitches or zigzag stitches for basic stuff
Andrew: Ive got a machine, still need to set it up and try it out.
Bill: > Me: I should save money
> also me: The artist I got sherwood from the last time reopened commissions and I should pay for him to do Sona
