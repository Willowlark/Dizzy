Bill: I tried to ask for tips with white outfit exposures (guess why). He started talking about ISO for some reason. 😅
Aldus (Jess): But doesn't that control the sensitivity to light? And therefore reflection of light off of white?
Bill: It’s not an issue of over exposure, it’s about how white is being metered. In this case, white white is being metered at grey.
Bill: It shifts the colors based on the given grey point.
Aldus (Jess): Ah
Bill: I think his expertise is more in graphic design stuff. He’s an excellent photographer, but definitely not a technical one. I tend to be technical.

Bill: and now I have two d200's from Ron.
