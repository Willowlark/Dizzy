Bill: !lewd
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/8vy5kG8.jpg
Bill: Excellent.
Aldus (Jess): whats lewd?
Dizzy: nerds.
Bill: !ghost nerds.
Bill: kk,.
Aldus (Jess): oo you're testing something
Bill: I switched Dizzy over to AWS, and it's fine.
Bill: I need to switch the DB as well, but another time.
Bill: then again aws has a file system, so I don't actually need a DB...
Afina (Georgia🍀): why the physics department is cool: oh you need a special permission number? here you go, have fun, do science
Afina (Georgia🍀): math department: apply through these specific official channels and MAYBE we'll give it to you, we dont care if you need this class to  graduate
Bill: Rowan was like that with it's Math department.
Bill: Math people just suck. 😆
Bill: Well fuck I broke the keyboard on my macbook.
Bill: space specifically.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oh that's no good
Bill: Well, I mostly fixed the key clip... but I already broke the clips on the keycaps.
Bill: *cap
Bill: Take it in tomorrow, hopefully it's an in store fix.
Aldus (Jess): Did you get your car back yet?
Bill: Yeah, Monday night. Bless.
Bill: I missed it so much,
Aldus (Jess): What was it in for?
Bill: Tuesday: The windshield got a crack from a rock, crossing most of the passenger side. had to be replaced.
Wednesday-Friday: Body shop for the bumper damage from the train station.
Monday (dropped it on saturday): Routine service and the dash computer was acting up.
Bill: When it rains it pours and all that.
Aldus (Jess): Oh boy
Afina (Georgia🍀): So remember how Ben texted me like a week ago askin about shooting again?
Afina (Georgia🍀): He texted me just now asked for a favor of spotting him gas money cause he may have gotten fired from his job
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's a little shifty, but then again I don't know if he really has other friends (I don't see any really on his Snapchat or Instagram)
Afina (Georgia🍀): And it's only 10 dollars, which I'm inclined to give cause he hasn't asked for money from shooting before
Afina (Georgia🍀): And he's gotten some nice pics so I'm kinda like yeah I don't mind
Afina (Georgia🍀): Thoughts anyone???
Eliran (Halim): don't shoot alone with the semi shifty
Bill: What. that’s weird. IMO.
Aldus (Jess): I dont even know anything about him so hard to say
Bill: You aren’t obligated to back pay for photos, that’s for sure.
Bill: And it’s not like you know him well right? You only talked for shooting stuff.
Aldus (Jess): I don't think it's weird for someone to ask for gas money, nbjt would suggest a buddy
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah that's true he's like only a photographer as opposed to being a friend first (like billiam)
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I don't shoot alone period (except with bill because billiam is friend first) so that's not an issue
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's mostly just speculating about the money
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think it's odd but I'm willing to suspend the weird-ness of it cause I don't mind spotting him 10
Afina (Georgia🍀): Especially when he's delivered some nice pics and I don't think he has many friends to ask anyways
Bill: It’s a nice thing to do, I know I’m just suspicious of ulterior motives. I don’t have a lot of acquaintances like that though so I have no experience in the matter, between that and I’m usually wary with money matters I’m somewhat biased.
Aldus (Jess): I'm not weary of money, ~~i'm just weary of boys~~
Bill: Oh, yeah, that’s non negotiable. You call up one of us for this shoot he wants to do or you skip. End of story.
Bill: Keep the kidnapping arcs to the play by post, not real life.
Aldus (Jess): Just being someone you trust with you, not nessesarily one of us
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I'm very leery of photographers, I always have that under control
Aldus (Jess): 👌
Bill: *I know I have no actual say in what you do, but don’t make me worry please*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Always shoot somewhere public (like Princeton or a park, the places I shot with him before)
Aldus (Jess): What day?
Bill: You went alone to Hillsborough though didn’t you?
Bill: Princeton you had Ryan and Reiley with you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah Princeton I have the solo weiss
Afina (Georgia🍀): And park I went alone but like, they're very public places
Afina (Georgia🍀): As in, I was never alone with him cause there were always people within sight and sound
Afina (Georgia🍀): Aaaanyways I sent him 10 so we'll see what happens with that
Bill: Mm... Does he know your family is loaded?
Bill: Not to be *overly suspicious* of someone I’ve never met, but “I watch out for me and mine” and all that.
Aldus (Jess): On the other hand some people just don't have money, I'd think hat if he was really looking for money he'd ask for more than $10
Bill: You’re right, I know it.
Bill: I don’t trust easily.
Aldus (Jess): The worst he can do with money is blow her off, so you never talk to him again and you lost 1 hrs pay (approx)
Bill: I’m more worried he treats as a gateway and starts trying to get more from you.
Aldus (Jess): So then you never talk to him again.
Aldus (Jess): Do you know anyone else that shoots with him <@245270932602486784>
Bill: He’s not a cosplay photographer. She *somehow*, ***lucky*** ran into him st the balloon festival and asked him if he’d want to try it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah he just started doing cosplay photography cause of me, I met him at the air balloon festival when I was crew last year, he was the balloon photographer
Bill: 😛
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEEE what bill said
Bill: Maybe not lucky now.
Bill: But for the meme.
Bill: And I was totally not jealous at the time.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😮 billiam nooo
Bill: I still have to outshoot that portrait with the yellow leaves. It’s top tier.
Aldus (Jess): Just be careful, tell people where you are going and when you will be back, keep in contact with someone, bring a friend, don't carry alot of cash, uhhhhhh ~~bring a knife buy some pepper spray~~
Bill: something about gemini and paranoia makes sense now.
Bill: But yes, plan to bring a friend.
Aldus (Jess): I watch too many crime shows ok
Afina (Georgia🍀): I got it guyssss don't worry 👌
Bill: ~~pick me, I can turn it into a shootout.~~
Bill: I've seen articles where two photographers go head to head with the same model and scene.
Bill: Tis neat.
Afina (Georgia🍀): REALLY that's pretty rad
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~I feel like competition is so aggressive tho, id just feel bad~~
Bill: yeah. One each photographer picked natural or flash lighting to see which looked better.
Bill: Was cool.
Bill: Also yes, competition is bad in this case.
Bill: ~~Also I'd win~~
Bill: ~~maybe~~
Bill: ~~...~~
Bill: So, I have a full mason jar of coins.
Bill: What are the odds the coinstar what, 25% fee is more than a coin counting machine on amazon?
Bill: Cause I'm about to risk it for the biscuit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hmmmmm how big da jar
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): How much is the coin counter?
Bill: Between 30-50.
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Bill: I think the manual one will work fine.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I feel like the coin Star might be more economical
Bill: you'd be surprised how much you get our of a jar of coins...
Aldus (Jess): Apparently if you get paid in form of gift card you don't have to pay fee?
Bill: I looked once, the gift cards are sucky.
Aldus (Jess): No Amazon? Idk Sussex bank let's you use there's for free if you have an account so that's what I use
Bill: I'll have to check, Amazon probably worth it now that I have prime.
Bill: the one in walmart doesn't do amazon, that's it.
Bill: I'd have to go to an ACME.

Aldus (Jess): I need fud
Afina (Georgia🍀): Acquire fud
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also I'm at my sisters band concert and middle school band sounds good
Afina (Georgia🍀): The orchestra is phenomenal considering these kids at 12
Afina (Georgia🍀): But the chorus sounds just like heckin kidz bop and I cannot
Aldus (Jess): LMFAO
Bill: three thousand munchkins and a troll.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like chorus just
Afina (Georgia🍀): I don't think BIG chorus can sound good
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe like 20 or less people but 50 12-year-olds??
Bill: Also doesn't help they haven't hit puberty and still have kid voices.
