Bill: > Go to canon to find copy of printer manual
> find manual download
> *Gets an installer*
> *Gets... an installer*
Bill: Hmm. They only make the photo paper I got with the printer in 8.5x11 and 13x19.
Bill: 13x19 is a bit of a weird size IMO, feel like 11x17 is more standard...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think 13c 19 is more standard for photos while 11x17 is more standard for posters
Bill: ~~can you tell I bought everything I have on my walls at a con~~
Bill: https://www.redrivercatalog.com/cost-of-inkjet-printing-canon-pro-100.html So if I've read this right, the cost in ink for a print is 2.70. So... when I run out of ink,  I'll have recooped the cost of replacement ink if I get 2.70 for each print.
Bill: ~~help~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): for 13x19s?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): for ink yea, then add in cost of the materials also
Bill: Which is just paper right?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea, some would says wear and tear on printer too but thats like impossible to price out
Bill: Standard price for the same paper is 100, so 50 sheets makes that 2.70+2= 4.70 a print.
Bill: For sanity and idk, service cost, round that to 5 (or 6, which is two kofis exactly)...
