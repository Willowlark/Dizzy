Nokri (Marisa): Yona drink omg
Nokri (Marisa): You ever notice how resumes and resumes is spelled the same. Freaky.
Aldus (Jess): Holy shit I need these
Elfriede (Tom): YESS
Elfriede (Tom): I like that action shot of my arm in the tube
Bill: Y’all do whatever you want, but clarify cute fall shit cause that sounds on point.
Aldus (Jess): Pumpkin picking, apple picking, hiking, drinking hot apple cider together, baking apple pie, etc.
Afina (Georgia): mmm apple ciderrrr
Afina (Georgia): thats the good shit
Elfriede (Tom): yo i could go for some warm apple cider right about now
Bill: Let’s goooo
Bill: I’m done with summer, I want flannels and colors and fall shit.
Afina (Georgia): so i did a "treat yo self"
Afina (Georgia): ive always had "go to a psychic" on my bucket list
Afina (Georgia): and im like ACTUALLY doin in
Afina (Georgia): it could be a bunch of hokey but honestly it just seems so cool and fun that i dont really mind if shes wrong
Afina (Georgia): ~~also its next door to a mcdonalds~~
Aldus (Jess): 😮 have fun!
Nokri (Marisa): how does one turn down a possible love confession from a person on the internet they've never met irl
Aldus (Jess): "I've never meet you"
Aldus (Jess): WAIT
Aldus (Jess): Is it like someone you don't really know or like an online friend?
Nokri (Marisa): it's the guy who's the reason i keep my status on invisible on discord. we were friends in a game for a few months, then once the game ended i basically stopped talking to them (also it ended right as I moved here)
Nokri (Marisa): i know i have to confront him, but he's very well liked in a mutual community that is incredibly toxic and that I haven't been very active in recently ~~because of him~~
Nokri (Marisa): Excessive sighs
Aldus (Jess): Oh boy
Aldus (Jess): I guess you could just explain that you kinda had a feeling but to be honest its one sided and you've been trying to avoid the conversation but it's time to come clean and that it's probably better for both of you if you don't talk anymore?
Aldus (Jess): 😬
Nokri (Marisa): truuuu
Nokri (Marisa): i think the hesitation is coming from an ingrown fear of retaliation and that he'll somehow slander my name and turn everyone against me. because of the game, everyone thinks we're BFFs4lyfe (even though on epicmafia i'm married to DrSharky because he's a dr and a shark and that's public on my profile)
Nokri (Marisa): like that sounds ridiculous but i don't know him well enough to know how he'd react, and again this community is super weird (even though it's gotten much nicer since it started dying)
Aldus (Jess): ~~i can't believe he thinks you would cheat on drsharky~~
Nokri (Marisa): **IKR**
Aldus (Jess): Is the community like really important to you? Like you have friends there you wanna keep?
Nokri (Marisa): yeah it would be nice. i've been part of it for about 5 years. i'm already losing it because the site is dying and many people are becoming inactive but whenever i do pop on people remember me
Nokri (Marisa): must've been because of my really awesome slander video during a propaganda challenge <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): 😮 whaaaa?
Nokri (Marisa): we do games that are like really bad reality TV shows and they have "challenges" - one of them was like a secret santa but instead of presents you had to slander them. i made a video that won by a landslide
Aldus (Jess): The most Savage ™
Aldus (Jess): I mean,I would hope they'd at least understand that you simply don't have feelings for someone youve never met
Nokri (Marisa): ye ideally that would be nice
Nokri (Marisa): i know i'm the one in the wrong here for ignoring and hiding from everyone. that's my specialty.
Nokri (Marisa): if i do respond it'll be after he goes to bed because it's going to become this whole thing, he makes everything into a long conversation and i'd like to think carefully about my answers so i don't hurt his feelings
Nokri (Marisa): oh wow in other news The Promised Neverland is entering its final arc. good on them, i honestly thought it was gonna be one of those manga that goes on for a billion chapters like one piece or naruto
Aldus (Jess): Yea that's a good idea. I'm honestly really bad at talking to people like that too? ~~Like it's so much easier to avoid it?~~ but yea it'll be easier if you can respond slowly and hopefully they will understand that you weren't trying to hurt his feelings?? ~~is he a creeper? Kinda sounds like a creeper~~
Nokri (Marisa): bit of a creeper, kept asking for cosplay photos so i kept directing him to social media
Aldus (Jess): Oh boy... Where is he from?
Nokri (Marisa): chilé so i blame part of it on culture
Nokri (Marisa): but i don't know much about chilean culture and he's modern enough to keep up with the rest of the group so maybe it's just him
Nokri (Marisa): am i supposed to be fasting today 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): no that's next week yehaw
Aldus (Jess): 😮 how long u has to fast for?
Nokri (Marisa): a day I think? in the US it was from sundown to sundown but idk how the timezone conversion works here 🤷 
i don't *have* to but *just in case*
Nokri (Marisa): we don't have to fast if it endangers health and seeing as i'll have to walk like 5 miles that day i might have something small
Aldus (Jess): For Rosh Hashanah?
Nokri (Marisa): ye! yom kippur.
Nokri (Marisa): i'm not religious but like *what if religion is real*
Aldus (Jess): Gotta have them bases covered 👌
Nokri (Marisa): exactly. i will shake a lemon once a year if i must.
Aldus (Jess): Oooo! So Rosh Hashanah is this week, and Yom Kippur is next week? Is that right?
Nokri (Marisa): u got it 🌟
Aldus (Jess): Wheeeee!
Nokri (Marisa): if you have a ram's horn you can blow it like a horn and if anyone complains be like "*i'm celebrating the new year*"
Aldus (Jess): NICE
Nokri (Marisa): happy new year btw 🎉 <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Hap new year 🎉
Aldus (Jess): Why am I still up
Nokri (Marisa): party time
Nokri (Marisa): woke
Aldus (Jess): Nuuuuuu so much party all weekend now sleep
Aldus (Jess): OHH that guy who you know who cosplays that character who looks like aldus was taking pics in the water park in cosplay and I was giggling like an idiot the whole time at the idea of Aldus being a photographer
Nokri (Marisa): selfie aldus
Aldus (Jess): Like he had an actual camera and stuff and he was near us while we were doing the rwby shoot I was very amused
Nokri (Marisa): aww he hasn't been on facebook i was trying to find the pictures

Nokri (Marisa): i wonder how many cameras were lost to the water
Aldus (Jess): Biru was taking oic of us in the hot tub and I was v. scared
Nokri (Marisa): danger zone
Aldus (Jess): I saw like a group of 5 Homestucks but I didnt get a pic I failed you
Nokri (Marisa): ~~is ok because next time you'll be cosplaying homestuck right~~
Nokri (Marisa): were they in the water?
Aldus (Jess): Naaaaa they were shopping
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): hmm
Elfriede (Tom): you could *blcok him on all platforms but i guess thats mean?*
Nokri (Marisa): i really want to but we share a lot of group chats <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): i've been waiting on this package all morning and i think it's been in my mailbox for 3 hours frghjnaefghrj ima go check
Elfriede (Tom): OOF

Dave: dab away the Zzz
Elfriede (Tom): Can't wait to eat real fewd tomorrow
Nokri (Marisa): how will you eat real food if all your crops are dead
Bill: You gotta tell him. Leaving him in the dark could be more damaging than turning him down properly.
Nokri (Marisa): ye is confirmed on the facebook page by the con chair
Nokri (Marisa): wait this isn't the convention channel
Nokri (Marisa): animenext roomblock confirmed on facebook by con chair
ye i gotta deal with it. i hope he realizes it's a bit foolish to like someone you've never met or spoken to or even seen not wearing a costume
Bill: he might not. But if you treat him respectfully anyway, he can't hold that against you.
Nokri (Marisa): "thanks for thinking i'm cool but truth is i'm a 48 year old dude"
Elfriede (Tom): 👌
Elfriede (Tom): The only true route
Aldus (Jess): im so out of it, my on boss just came in here to talk about actual work and i was like "duhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
Nokri (Marisa): that's it that's how you work. a productive meeting.
Aldus (Jess): than he was like "can you do that?" and i said "yea no prob"
Aldus (Jess): i have no idea what he said
Aldus (Jess): opps
Bill: Barely making it in for morning meeting.
Bill: Actually might be late by a few.
Bill: *idgaf tho*
Nokri (Marisa): *run*
Aldus (Jess): why is it so rainy and sad out
Nokri (Marisa): global warming
Afina (Georgia): I still have a headache what the fuck
Elfriede (Tom): Nani the fuck
Elfriede (Tom): Wakey wakey vegetables and sadness
Afina (Georgia): I was slorping soup all last night and drinking watah like what
Bill: did you sleep too much?
Bill: I get a headache when I do that.
Aldus (Jess): dayquill yo

Aldus (Jess): they played audio of a girl getting those corrective glasses for color blindness on the radio on my way to work. I cri everytiem
Afina (Georgia): Eriks the first person I saw post about suicide prevention day
Afina (Georgia): He seems really devoted to the cause, especially cause he's walking for it
Afina (Georgia): That's kinda inspiring
Aldus (Jess): erik is a precious bean
Aldus (Jess): too good
Afina (Georgia): I gave a smol donation
Afina (Georgia): It feels good to direct my motivation towards something rather than have a pity party about what's going on in my life
Afina (Georgia): Plus maybe the good karma will come back to me 😂
Nokri (Marisa): a natural disaster is the last thing i want to happen while trying on costumes
earth pls stop shaking
Bill: We are not worthy of Erik.
Bill: There’s an idea. Start a project and succeed at it. Cosplay or something. Distraction, and productive.
Bill: ~~Though you will have to start facing things eventually~~
Dizzy: You should choose  megaman hack music
Bill: Dizzy, choose nier hack music, megaman hack music
Bill: *I am hackerman*
Afina (Georgia): Yeah cosplay isn't going it for me right now sadly
Afina (Georgia): Maybe later
Bill: 😭
Bill: Need garbage amounts of fanfic? I got rwby and miraculous like no one's business.
Afina (Georgia): Nahhh
Afina (Georgia): I think the suicide prevention thing helps because I want to focus on doing good for other people
Afina (Georgia): Charity is a good focus right now
Afina (Georgia): Maybe I can do something with cosplay and charity....
Bill: 😮
Dave: 👍
