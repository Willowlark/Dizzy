Bill: Jim Jefferies is going to be in moniclair during june.
Bill: Not sure if it's the same tour as before.
Bill: I'm not going to be able to leave before 5... I need to go the braun's tonight too, get a form notarized... I don't think I'll have time to stop at Unique on the way home to bitch about my flash radio.
N🆗ri (Marisa): something is really weird about my zenkai schedule. 9 hours a day? our assigned area isn't even open that long and autographs don't go that long.
and just the way stuff is being run this year and how we're being treated.
bojo and i will probably resign from staff for next year unless there's a really good reason not to.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea they over sheduled you?
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe? i'm not working thursday night and we usually always do that which cuts down on the burden. the con isn't even open until 6pm sunday so what are we supposed to do for that?
I'd assume the 9 hours is because there's a one hour break in there somewhere? but that was never mentioned and no other teams i've worked on do that at all.
N🆗ri (Marisa): for cosplay staff we pick and chose what we wanted to do that added up to 24 hours, and for dealers room staff we just worked thursday night, friday morning, and then whenever dealers was open
N🆗ri (Marisa): now that we're dealer's security it should theoretically be the same? since we only work in the dealer's hall??
Bill: Fuck staff, come hang with us!!!!
Bill: Got the flash receiver replaced.
Bill: Hopefully works better.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can hang out before 1pm on friday or after 7pm saturday owo
