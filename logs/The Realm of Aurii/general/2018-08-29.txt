Afina (Georgia🍀): _your beautiful photo now exists on the Rutgers McCormick Hall wall_
Elfriede (Tom): Very Nicu 👌 👌
Nokri (Marisa): WOAH das neat

Nokri (Marisa): “Wow it’s great to meet you, thanks for trading social media. Too bad I’ll be too busy with school to come to these meetings from now on.”
“Yeah me too! I have to go to cram school for my college entrance exams next year. I’m in high school.”

Why are all my potential Japanese friends high school girls. Why this.
Nokri (Marisa): Also there’s nothing like old Japanese men yelling “you sound unsure of your answer. Be confident,” to make you more confident in yourself. That got me at least like 15 minutes of serotonin.
Elfriede (Tom): Damn
Elfriede (Tom): I didn't expect old japanese men to be motivational
Nokri (Marisa): oh yeah. it's either "you will never impress me in a million years" or anime-style "what are you waiting for? you can do it!"
there's no in between
Elfriede (Tom): OOF
Elfriede (Tom): I wish I could imagine it, but that sounds great
Elfriede (Tom): Also sounds like it could be scary <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): here u go

Nokri (Marisa): ~~me @ you playing rune factory~~
Elfriede (Tom): I'm so motivated
Elfriede (Tom): Shit
Bill: Make friends with high school girls. It’ll be fine.
Elfriede (Tom): Is this a harem anime?
Bill: Slong as you don’t ask to borrow their uniform. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): ~~it's ok i have my own uniforms~~
Elfriede (Tom): ~~tru~~
Nokri (Marisa): "wow your japanese is so good you even speak keigo"
???? ????????????
did i???? use keigo??????????????
it's probably the overly formal speak because of anime. she found out my dark true self when i gave her my instagram.
Elfriede (Tom): Keigo ? Never heard the term
Elfriede (Tom): Is it special Japanese <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Girl: we wish you could come to school with us wwwww
Marisa: ...
Marisa: *looks over girls uniform*
Marisa: I’ve already got the uniform.
Nokri (Marisa): honestly until she said she was a high schooler i couldn't tell if she was wearing a uniform or just being a trendy japanese girl in a uniform-esque outfit
Nokri (Marisa): her school definitely does not have anti-roll skirts
Elfriede (Tom): Oh damn
Bill: Anti what?
Elfriede (Tom): So keigo is types of specific honorifics?
Nokri (Marisa): anti roll <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
so like. some schoolgirls make their skirts shorter by rolling the waistband over the fabric. some skirts are designed to not be able to do that (no elastic and it's sewn in a certain way. i forget how but i have a skirt that's anti-roll and it's utterly impossible to roll it)
Nokri (Marisa): yee keigo is fancy speak for important people. store clerks use it all the time and if I have a complex question i gotta be like "please don't speak fancy to me"
Nokri (Marisa): here's an example of the skirt thing
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): From school to anime in just 3 rolls
Elfriede (Tom): Wowwe
Bill: Right, I knew the rolling skirt thing. I didn’t realize the lengths Japan had gone to in keeping schoolgirls from fetishizing themselves.
Nokri (Marisa): wow look at everyone awake and logged on. so inspiring.
Afina (Georgia🍀): H-hewwo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Being awake for work is so weird
Nokri (Marisa): https://78.media.tumblr.com/f591a68154bfa3f21ee5da95fa1e27e3/tumblr_inline_ouw620QnEv1ug4va2_1280.gif
Bill: not like you haven't done it before.
Nokri (Marisa): georgia just paints her eyelids to look like eyes before work so she doesn't get caught not being awake
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^

Afina (Georgia🍀): I fell asleep last night midway through writing my post
Afina (Georgia🍀): So it's like "we should go to callora and thdjjdjbejxjgsk"
Bill: I had a dream about a con... think it was supposed to be in NYC, cause security was annoying. Tom and Jess and I were waiting on Georgia and Hal, who eventually showed up in Pharah helmetless and what I believe Ezreal's normal skin looks like.
Bill: That's all I can remember.
Bill: I get the feeling that when I woke up I was like 'have to finish that conversation' tho.
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH I had a dream that the people that spy on the internet, the government people, would send you updates when the contents of what you typed on the computer was too sad
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like they would email like "r u ok"
Nokri (Marisa): that's how they do it now, the nsa can't message you irl without blowing their cover so they ask in dreams
Bill: I was not slightly close to what real Ezreal is.
Afina (Georgia🍀): What did you think he looked like lol
Bill: It was a full armor thing.
Bill: I haven't seen anything but star guardian.
Aldus (Jess): I am awake, and ready to sing "last of the weedlewums" in about 10 hrs <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
