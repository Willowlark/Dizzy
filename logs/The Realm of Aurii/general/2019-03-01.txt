Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So Bill... wanna shoot some C-3P-hO Thursday night? 😏
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I understand if you don't want to corrupt your SD card with those cursed images
Bill: Slong as we have time after bees.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): SHLONG*
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: ~~also I used XQD cards~~
Bill: I actually need a second XQD. They very expensive for storage though. Iirc 150+ bucks.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA ERIK GET IT RIGHT
Bill: *I’ll make it a ko-fi goal*

~~Hahahaha~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof
Bill: Apparently Byram McDonald’s has uber eats.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *you were 7 stops away at 1:00*
N🆗ri (Marisa): they've gotten so close so many times, they were literally 5 minutes away once i coulda walked to them yet their route has 'em going all over south jersey
what is this nonsense
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think i'm gonna make a pair of meowths. i can make an alolan one with the leftover scraps from my itabag if I have any. ~~time to order more itabag fabric~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's so bizarre you still haven't gotten it
N🆗ri (Marisa): amazon promised i'd have it before 9 *the clock is ticking punk*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i literally watched them sit in the same location for, what, like 5 or 6 hours? what were they doing in all that time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 8:59pm "Heeeeeeere you go! "
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea what were they doing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Watching two feature length films on their phone
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): **you were so close now where are you going
you have 18 minutes to get back here**
N🆗ri (Marisa): YASSS
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): if they drive past i swear
N🆗ri (Marisa): They did t
N🆗ri (Marisa): 6 minutes to spare and they made it
N🆗ri (Marisa): we did it fam
N🆗ri (Marisa): thanks for following this epic journey
Bill: I wanna do something while I have an hour but...
Bill: I'm just tired.
Aldus Larian (Jess): NAP TIME
Bill: you mean sleep?
Aldus Larian (Jess): NAP TIME
Bill: netflix time.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sleep
N🆗ri (Marisa): finally i can see my children again
N🆗ri (Marisa): people just don't die of shock like they used to in the old days anymore.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nor do ladies give birth standing on two cinderblocks but that may be an improvement
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok so we have pants and we have skirts but has anyone tried making bottoms that are just like 50 pant legs all attached to one garment and they're all fully functional and maybe even have pockets but you only put your legs through two of them
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think they would be nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I understand
Bill: Oh it snowed.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had the same reaction
Aldus Larian (Jess): Us too
Bill: It’s just enough for that Nier scarf thing. Sundown is 5:50 so even if game right to you as you got home there’s not enough time. Rip.
Bill: Part of me wants to get a backpack for my camera...
Bill: I have my grandfather's camera back, which fit's alot and is nice, but is definitely at capacity and digs into my shoulder after a full day. I have a messenger I use for work that has camera pockets, but it can't be used for more than camera and a single lens. Same issue with the single strap too. 

Cept I don't like backpacks much, cause I can't get quick access to them. Though, I usually have my camera out anyway and I could get the backpack strap mount I saw awhile back that's really neat. Kinda liked the idea of the sling style, but that has literally all the problems of the other bags.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm looking up camera bags but I literally have no idea what you're actually looking for... but I did find this that I thought was kind of neat and would give you easier access to your camera gear: https://smile.amazon.com/CADeN-Backpack-Multifunction-Waterproof-Compatible/dp/B06XGT6KMK/ref=sr_1_33?keywords=camera+bag&qid=1551449574&s=gateway&sr=8-33
Bill: The side access is pretty common in camera bags.
Bill: I've taken a shine to this https://www.lowepro.com/us-en/freeline-bp-350-aw-black-lp37170-pww/ here.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I was literally pulling out this morning and had to stop to shovel 4 inches
Bill: I know the brand, and the shelving system looks legit.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That I didn't know was there
Bill: Ye.
Bill: I gotta see if I can get up the drive way in the Forester, even with the snow.
Bill: it super weird that the top shelf of the camera divider is the top section of the bag.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ooooh that's actually really cool
Bill: Lowepro is a classic brand.
Bill: Been bouncing around a few of their offerings.
Bill: Not sure I could front mount my tripod tho.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yikes at that price though
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: ya'll spend 200 bucks on cosplay, I buy expensive camera gear.
Bill: ~~except when I dropped 450 on Hazel and Barry Burton cosplays, complete with 120 dollar 3d printer revolver for the latter~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): shit, you right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was looking at steampunk stuff and literally a pair of pants was $112
Bill: steampunk Tai?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at some point I'd like to
Bill: Please, it'd be amazing.
Bill: https://www.lowepro.com/us-en/m-trekker-hp-120-lp37159-config/ this is so adorably useless.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I found this and I don't know what it's for, but it's only on one arm and I figure it'd be perfect for him: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B010VNC5DU/?coliid=I16PSR3UF3F8EE&colid=293RWYBU4G3RS&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that'... literally... just a fanny pack... for your camera....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that price tag
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OOF
Bill: I doubt that would fit my camera, even without lens attached.
Bill: oof. Unique doesn't carry the freeline.
Bill: I'd have to go to B&H in the city to see it without buying it.
Bill: >Watching video review
> talking about the strap
> "High grade eva foam"
> nonono, I'm the photographer not the cosplayer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So my boss wants to have a meeting at some point today and I have no idea exactly what time or how long it's going to be. I have my phone screen at noon. I fucking hate trying to find a new job while already being employed
Bill: It cannot be fun.
Bill: I'm not motivated to find out.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He said we're going to have it at 11:30 or sometime after lunch
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I'm just like <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ugh
Aldus Larian (Jess): could you tell him theres some type of emergency and yeet outa there?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like I want to email the guy to see if we can push it to 2, but if we have the meeting after lunch, there's no telling how long it's going to take
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and it's about stupid ISO and audit stuff that usually is not quick
Bill: If what I've gleened from Japneet (our HR person) is accurate, the recruiters know you have your actual job and will be accommodating because they're interested in your candidacy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Maybe I can push it towards the end of the day because my boss should be gone by then and that usually the dead part of Fridays
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you know what, fuck it. I'm just going to ask if we can have the meeting after lunch because I'm expecting a call at noon
Bill: say it's blood work results.
Bill: SOunds important.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He doesn't need to know what it's about. There's really no reason why he should have to know what it's about
Bill: true. But it's an excuse if he does ask.
Aldus Larian (Jess): one time my boss gave a girl trouble with leaving early and demanded a reason so she just shouted "I HAVE TO GO TO THE VAG DOCTOR"
Aldus Larian (Jess): just do that
Bill: Better to placate the thought of 'what could he be doing' with a non answer than let him rub brain cells together and get closer to the answer.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): erik saying he needs to go to the vag doctor
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my excuse when I asked to take personal time to go on interviews was "I have an appointment" and then he was like "Oh, is everything ok?" because he thought it was some kind of doctor appointment
Aldus Larian (Jess): its a good plan i know
Aldus Larian (Jess): im wearing like the weirdest outfit for work
I have a button down dress shirt, leggings, and combat boots.  im pretty sure this isnt business casual but no one cares
Aldus Larian (Jess): my boss just walked past the door and coughed in his rough old man way and scared the fucking shit outa me
N🆗ri (Marisa): cough back to assert dominance
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone bring me coffee at work so i dont have to go to the lunch room where all the guests are
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > waiting for this call before I actually eat my lunch
> 6 minutes late and still no call
> afraid to start eating lunch
Aldus Larian (Jess): time to sweat nervously
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): successfully ate half my sandwich
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): still no call
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hopefully this isn't a red flag for this company...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof my mom is great, I texted her saying I was considering switching shifts to study for midterms
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And she sends me “school is a priority” with a thumbs up and a nerdy emoji
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *still no call*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :/
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTF
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, thanks dude. obviously you're interested in me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Welp, it's 12:30... lunch is technically over

Bill: Didn’t want to invite people to geek week this year?
Bill: Course it’s going to snow and it snowed last year so geek week is pretty crap timing but.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause i gotta batten down the hatches and study tomorrow, i figured the drive wasnt worth it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if i couldve had people stay and dicked around i wouldve prob made a bigger deal about it
