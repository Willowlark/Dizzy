Aldus Larian (Jess): Facebook's changed the color of its app icon and its very distracting
Nokri (Marisa): it's so convenient when things click in your head
like when you're washing your hands and suddenly you know the steps to the shuffle you wanted to learn
Nokri (Marisa): omg there's a drill wig tutorial on instagram and the girl doing the tutorial recommends using caulk for the wig. which is all fine and dandy but then she says *smooth it out with your fingers* and it shows her smooth the caulk with her bare hands and then continue working, smoothing it out every one in a while
***girl***
Nokri (Marisa): that is **so** risky and she's just casually touching the caulk artsydhyjfkjhgf
Aldus Larian (Jess): My dad does that
Nokri (Marisa): **is he ok**
that stuff is a skin irritant and too much exposure to it builds up over time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): why is Thor Ragnarok so fucking good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I HAD IT ON WHILE STUDYING YESTERDAY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it just IS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the opening fight is just so great
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and the scene with Strange is also so great

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1508-Delaware-Ave-Wyomissing-PA-19610/8939335_zpid/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There has to be some kind of catch to this...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 2 bed/2 bath house, $800/month, includes everything but electric and internet/cable
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): in the *rich* side of the town I live in
Bill: It sounds like it‚Äôs only half the listing space.
Bill: ‚ÄúSecond floor apartment‚Äù
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah you right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I'd have... *a housemate*?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~shudders~*
Bill: A landlord.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): even worse
Bill: Man i just know everything you‚Äôre looking at is hella affordable compared to places in jersey.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): move to PA!
Bill: Dude I already commute 2 and 1/2 hours.
Bill: If I move any further from NYC I‚Äôll die.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think my best bet might be this apartment I found yesterday... Like, I hate how impulsive it seems, but I don't think I'm going to find any better of a deal
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the only issue with that place is a single left turn *out* of the complex to get onto the main road to work because the road turns into an on-ramp for another busy highway
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I think I gathered all of my recurring monthly payments and I'm looking to pay about $1500 total per month which is doable for me. And then there's a few months spread throughout the year that my annual/bi-annual recurring payments fall under but I don't think any of them are in the same month
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But that's not including credit card or groceries so I'm just going to have to be more mindful of my spending
Bill: Mint.com can do some neat budget analysis stuff.
Bill: Rip couldn‚Äôt get haircut today. Which was my big plan for today.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can't wait for Marisacon!
