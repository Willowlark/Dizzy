Bill: ~~Just in case you didn't know, sudoku is in that puzzle collection I shared~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh shit yeah it is
Bill: I'm not terribly good at Sudoku, but they have a pencil mark feature which is useful. Let's you mark any of the numbers you think are in the blank squares, 1-9. Can also use it to mark what's not in the square, but I never tried that.
Bill: On paper you could do both.
Bill: Helpful for getting started.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's what I do (spoilers)
Bill: So glad I'm not in the canada office.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo past me left a yogurt in the fridge here i dont have to starve whoo
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'm making progress in between work
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmm i wonder how Georgia is doing
Aldus Larian (Jess): has anyone heard from her since the hurrucane hit?
Bill: I don't think it made landfall in Florida.
Bill: It shifted east back into the atlantic.
Nokri (Marisa): Ye I was wondering that last night. Winds were just starting to hit the coast around 3am
Nokri (Marisa): I think the devastation it caused in the Bahamas also toned it down to category 3
Bill: It'll be a stormy, gusty day or two, but if (large if) the model holds that'll be all Georgia gets.
Bill: Seeing that as well Marisa.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo ok i wasnt sure of what it ended up being likr
Bill: She was online playing League at some point yesterday so she's probably doing fine.
Nokri (Marisa): Is there any news of the damage to the Bahamas? I haven’t really heard anything which is the most concerning
Bill: worlds most unfortunately last name
Aldus Larian (Jess): some stuff here:
https://twitter.com/Bahamaspress?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor
Nokri (Marisa): Oo thank
I was reading at least 5 confirmed deaths and 13,000 houses destroyed but that it’s still too early to get to certain areas to assess the damage
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh jeez yea it went directly over the Bahamas D:
Nokri (Marisa): It was going 1mph and then actually stopped moving for a bit
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i saw that heres the hurricane from space:
Nokri (Marisa): I wouldn’t be surprised if the death toll is way higher
Big hurricane oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): before and after
Nokri (Marisa): O u c h
Nokri (Marisa): Death toll has to be higher than five
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea its gotta be they prob just dont know yet?
Aldus Larian (Jess): cnn has a live updater thingy:
https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/hurricane-dorian-us-florida/index.html

Nokri (Marisa): I’m glad it skipped over Puerto Rico, they’re still recovering from the 2017 storm
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i know 😦
Bill: I read across the top of the screen too fast and read the topic as "aurii is a mistake"
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Finally solved that puzzle
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ALSO DAMN BAHAMAS NOO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's a mess but my answers;
El🆓de Faun (Tom): (spoilers)

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao I forgot to fill in those two woops
Bill: Claritin ain't doing it for me. I gotta try Zyrtec.
Bill: ~~oh my god I started college 7 years ago is my hair grey~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): mine is <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I got caught in a meeting for like 2 hours so I couldn't continue sudoku 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Aww ripp
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And the meeting isn't even over. We just breaked for lunch
Bill: That's not very productive.
Bill: People tune out of meetings after 45 minutes pretty consistently.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeahh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We're going over our backlog of corrective actions
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So it's not like we're just sitting there doing nothing. We actually have to all be giving input into stuff. It's just tedious and annoying
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like a madman, I erased all of my number notes other than the ones set in stone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): To see if starting over with more numbers helps me overcome my rutt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I am stuck and I'm resisting the urge to peek at Tom's answers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): this one truly was diabolical
Nokri (Marisa): I can’t find the proper scissors I need but in the spot the scissors *should* be is the DVD for Vampire Knight season one part one
Nokri (Marisa): That about sums up my house
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): HAHA found another number!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and I'm stuck again
Bill: <@!325788935865368578> <@!228287793099440128>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): @erik try the box method , let me describe it
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Let's say there are only two '5' notes in a row (or collumn) 
And parral to that in a different row( or collumn) there's only two as well
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You then can erase every 5 note in the perpendicular row or collumn
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I drew it out, imagine the boxes
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 
Glonk: Ty for the post, waiting on the group invite to respond
El🆓de Faun (Tom): This is at work someone explain

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They're hosting an Oktoberfest party at their house
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which seems normal enough
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but they're notorious alcoholics and planning on themselves and their guests getting absolutely trashed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): to the point where they have a deal with a local Holiday Inn for reduced rates
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Their property is about 3 acres
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my brother-in-law inquired about camping out on their property instead of doing a hotel xD
Kaio Vermino (Lee): would certainly be cheaper
Bill: Proof Lee was technically in something anime club related!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Woah
Bill: Trippy right?
Bill: We've been missing Lee for *years*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): i was invisible until after highschool
Bill: While I understand your aversion for 'the anime kid' back in the day, is definitely a shame. We making up for lost time though.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bringing this behemoth to the next pillow fight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *it weighs 10lbs*
Kaio Vermino (Lee): thats a good pillow to smother someone with
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:rapid:607237006539489310>
