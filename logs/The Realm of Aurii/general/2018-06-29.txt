Nokri (Marisa): my friend pestered me to go to this event with her for weeks and i had to make a ton of arrangements to go and was reluctant but i decided to go
and she just messaged me she "can't buy a ticket for some reason"
*girl. the ticket sales ended yesterday and you've been bugging me to go to this for like  a month and a half.*
Aldus (Jess): 🙄 ugggggg
Aldus (Jess): That's so annoying 😔 can you at least get the money back for the ticket?
Nokri (Marisa): nop. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
I'll go anyway, it's a cosplay event but it's farther than I usually like to go.
she's like "why don't you just request every sunday off from work from now on so you absolutely won't miss an event with me?"
because i like making money so i can pay my rent properly. that's why. I'd be missing out on at least $100 a week and I'd be losing money if I took off to pay for events every single week.
Nokri (Marisa): she said she'll go early and line up and try to buy a ticket there the day of
Elfriede (Tom): 😧
Aldus (Jess): Yea it's not that easy  ughhh
Aldus (Jess): Like yea I'll just starve so I can go to stuff with yoi
Nokri (Marisa): she's been banned from staffing at 4 or 5 conventions and i see why now 🤔 at first i was sympathetic but after the 3rd time I was like "something's off here"
i'm the person she comes to to vent and i'm fine with that but it's amazing that she's here on a full time work visa and she only works 28 hours a week and complains that she works too much. i'm full time student with a part time work permit and i also work 28 hours a week so how is her visa valid if she isn't working full time?? what is this witchcraft
Aldus (Jess): What even?
Aldus (Jess): Damn props to you though 👌 you go girl
Nokri (Marisa): her specialty is autographs she can get any autograph
she was fired from the zenkai exhibits team because she's miss her shift to go wait in autograph lines. so she was given to uhhh the admissions? whatever it's called. the people who check you in for pre-reg because those hours were different. she still missed like half her shifts.
Aldus (Jess): What?? Omggggg is she the same at work?
Nokri (Marisa): idk i don't think so because if she missed work she'd lose her housing and probably be deported because they're sponsoring her visa
but like
she'd get very buddy-buddy with the guests when she was on guest relations at other cons. As in she'd get their personal contact info and start messaging them. Some were fine with it (she's friends with Michele Knotz and tells that to literally everyone - she'll go up to random japanese cosplayers and get their picture and be like "yeah i'm friends with a voice actress") but that was against the convention rules for their staff to get the guest's contact info.   that's why she was fired from some of those
Nokri (Marisa): and another time at a smaller con she signed up for guest relations and didn't have a car.
a BIG part of guest relations is driving to the airport and picking up the guest, and bringing them to their hotel and to and from the con. she showed up late because she carpooled and then had no way to pick up her assigned guest because she didn't have a car and said she didn't know she needed one even though it was in the requirements when she signed up
Aldus (Jess): What?!?! Omg so basically she didn't even read it
Nokri (Marisa): i like her, she's a fun person, but golly she is a handful.
Aldus (Jess): Yea I got you
Nokri (Marisa): she's the one who got mad because they wouldn't let her cosplay randomly at work
Nokri (Marisa): i thought she meant for halloween but no she meant on any random day just dress up for the kids
Aldus (Jess): Umm? Where does she work or did she work
Nokri (Marisa): she works at a juku, which is like a cram school for older kids or an optional preschool for younger kids so she teaches little kids all day. she hates it.
Nokri (Marisa): but her apartment is dirt cheap because it's owned by her boss
Nokri (Marisa): luckyyy
Aldus (Jess): Would any place in Japan let you cospaly to work? Would any place in America even let you do that like srsly
Nokri (Marisa): I doubt it
Nokri (Marisa): some people are models who cosplay for work but that's like a commission based thing
Aldus (Jess): Yea that's like part of the job in that case. What did she want to cosplay?
Aldus (Jess): I can't imagine showing up to work in cosplay
Nokri (Marisa): she has an Ash Ketchum cosplay and a few others. On halloween she's allowed to dress up but it has to be from an American source because it's an English school. She's a cosplayer but a very casual one, she doesn't style wigs or wear makeup or anything. she spends a lot of money on costumes and wigs but would look so much better if she cut the bangs ;~; so much potential
Nokri (Marisa): like she spent $200 on a hero academia uniform?? but you can buy them for $20 online? why she buy the expensive one she knew about the cheaper one :0
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Aldus (Jess): What?! That's just... Not ok
Aldus (Jess): Like why would you do that
Nokri (Marisa): cheritz's survey is so pure they're so kind
Aldus (Jess): I only read the first page of the cosplay one
Aldus (Jess): I love how the First question is "are you gonna be honest"
Nokri (Marisa): my work has a halloween party where we can dress up I'm really hopin' to be able to work that, but it's a separate paid event for the customers and the normal lessons are all cancelled for the day (otherwise we'd wear the usual suits).

the cosplay one is so nice!! YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): and instead of just "give us your pictures" it's like "Would you be comfortable sending us your pictures?"
Aldus (Jess): The most I do on Halloween for work is like the basic cat costume I'd probably get in trouble if I tried to fo something more than that
Nokri (Marisa): ~~yet you wear your seven hoodie ;3c~~
Aldus (Jess): Oh yeah! That's stealth cosplay tho
Aldus (Jess): My boss just thinks it's a jacket
Aldus (Jess): My coworkers says it's "neat"
Nokri (Marisa): *they know*
Aldus (Jess): 👀
Nokri (Marisa): anyone got any good late night con stories <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): there was the one time hal and i were walking back from something
Afina (Georgia🍀): and some dude was walking in front of us
Afina (Georgia🍀): and we werent following him but we were right behind him
Afina (Georgia🍀): and he turns a corner and we dont think anything of us
Afina (Georgia🍀): and were going the same direction so we also turn the corner
Afina (Georgia🍀): and boom hes making out with a girl in a fake cop uniform
Afina (Georgia🍀): and were like ok you do you
Afina (Georgia🍀): but then he, still making out with the girl, sticks his hand out and gives us a thumbs up
Eliran (Halim): It was sweet
Nokri (Marisa): o-oh
Nokri (Marisa): i thought this was going to be like a mugging or something
Afina (Georgia🍀): and then i think he said something but i dont remember
Nokri (Marisa): but that's also scary
Eliran (Halim): They were cute
Eliran (Halim): Also we were walking back to our room from the second katsu room
Afina (Georgia🍀): THAT WAS IT yes
Eliran (Halim): There was an officer joke somewhere along the line there
Nokri (Marisa): oh does anyone remember if zenkaikon had cosplay wrestling this year? they were supposed to be banned from the con but we got a new con chair
Aldus (Jess): I don't think so
Nokri (Marisa): woah the grudge is real
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I didn't see it anywhere but idk
Afina (Georgia🍀): if it wasnt in the vlog it didnt happen
Nokri (Marisa): last year they kept trying to delay their event. we had a huge line that was almost out of control and it was already past the time the event should've started and the runner of wrestling got into a fight with the con chair in an attempt to stall for time
Nokri (Marisa): it was all set up and everyone was there we dunno why they were trying to postpone it
Nokri (Marisa): it's gone way downhill since their first kotoricon show anyway
Nokri (Marisa): nancy has told me a wonderful story of this fluttershy cosplayer
Afina (Georgia🍀): eugh
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats my next nightmare
Nokri (Marisa): teleport away
Afina (Georgia🍀): THAT WAS A GOOD DREAM
Afina (Georgia🍀): i have a lot of vivid dreams
Afina (Georgia🍀): if that wasnt obvious
Nokri (Marisa): can you lucid dream?
Afina (Georgia🍀): wuzzat
Nokri (Marisa): like when you 'wake up' in your dream and you're still asleep but you know you're dreaming and can control it
Afina (Georgia🍀): sorta yeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): if i become self aware that im dreaming ye
Afina (Georgia🍀): otherwise im like oh yeah dream georgia is real georgia
Elfriede (Tom): That's only happened to me like twice
Nokri (Marisa): ooo?
Elfriede (Tom): Once when I was a kid
Elfriede (Tom): I gave myself super powers like flying
Elfriede (Tom): And woke my self up by saying bye to my animal friends
Elfriede (Tom): So wholesome 😭
Elfriede (Tom): And the other one I woke up rather fast and I don't remember much, other than I had control
Elfriede (Tom): I had a co-worker that was training himself to have lucid dreams
Elfriede (Tom): He got close a couple nights but he kept waking up
Nokri (Marisa): ooo that's freaky
Afina (Georgia🍀): do you ever have really realistic dreams and wake up still feeling the same way??
Nokri (Marisa): there are machines that help with that
Elfriede (Tom): Apparently you train yourself to check the time in the dream
Elfriede (Tom): By conditioning yourself somehow
Nokri (Marisa): i once had a dream that i was playing epicmafia and when i woke up i was like "i need to stop playing so much mafia"
Afina (Georgia🍀): omg
Nokri (Marisa): the machines have lights or sounds and at a certain time they'll emit a soft beep that you can hear in the dream and it's like "oh hey I know that sound so this must be a dream"
Afina (Georgia🍀): i once dreamed i was having a fight with someone and i woke up and i was like oh god im gonna punch him and my chest was all tight
Elfriede (Tom): One time Dave thought he was playing darksouks and wen to dodge an attack in the dream and rolled out of bed <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): OMG REALLY
Elfriede (Tom): <@228287793099440128>
Nokri (Marisa): pls say you were there and got film of it
Elfriede (Tom): I wish lmao
Elfriede (Tom): But yeah to lucid dream intentionally you have to practice and condition youself
Elfriede (Tom): And even then it's still hard
Afina (Georgia🍀): waiting for the time were all havin a sleepover and someone talks in their sleep <:lenny:395307171539189760>

the room is pitch black and everyone's asleep and he just goes "man the lighting here sucks"
Elfriede (Tom): He doesn't form coherent words usually <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~just fucking put the fucking thing in the fucking thing~~
Elfriede (Tom): Except THAT time
Nokri (Marisa): OwO
Nokri (Marisa): apparently i ask questions in my sleep
Elfriede (Tom): How many cats could you offer me good sir
Nokri (Marisa): like "can we go shopping?" and BoJo heard me and was like "...no?" and i was like "online shopping"
Elfriede (Tom): Hahaha omg

Elfriede (Tom): Online shopping❤
Elfriede (Tom): What an amazing thing

Nokri (Marisa): online shopping is the future
Nokri (Marisa): omg BoJo sleep talks too but she gets really sassy about it and fights people in her sleep

Elfriede (Tom): 🙌
Elfriede (Tom): That sounds good
Afina (Georgia🍀): which one do we wanna find more 😮
Aldus (Jess): I can lucid dream sometimes! Like not every night but maybe a few times a month? Usually it's just relising this this a dream and then waking myself up if it's bad or like going along with it if it's good
Nokri (Marisa): The Moon is Lovely Tonight
Elfriede (Tom): Oo forreal

Dave: Or running away from a giant crab
Dave: With loafers
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH ESCAPE ROOMS
Afina (Georgia🍀): THE BUTTER DREAM SAID TO DO THEM TOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow that's really weird now that I think about it
Afina (Georgia🍀): I didn't think I was pursuing an escape but maybe my subconscious says otherwise
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah dunno, I mean dreams don't ALWAYS mean something
Elfriede (Tom): Unless you do feel that way
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's truuuuuue
Elfriede (Tom): But I think you'd be able to figure that out

Aldus (Jess): Ah shit I forgot to credit Billiam
Aldus (Jess): I knew I was doing something wrong
Bill: I didn't notice, and I read the caption.
Bill: ~~Bullshit the headphones were the only reason~~
Aldus (Jess): Isnt that what I basically said?
Bill: I'm saying it was more than the headphones.
Aldus (Jess): That's where the idea to cosplay him started though
Bill: Had nothing to do with him being hot as fuck?
Bill: speaking of hot as fuck, I came out on the porch to do the last of my work and watch the bird feeder, it's *hell* out here.
Dave: Jess, take off Thursday and Friday so tom can take off and then there could be no people in testing at work
Aldus (Jess): I can't take off 😭
Aldus (Jess): That doesn't mean he can though
Aldus (Jess): And it did but the idea didn't come from that
