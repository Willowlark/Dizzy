Bill: Possibly. If you’re really desperate you could try where katy and Mom go.
Aldus (Jess): They might have meant August 30th tho 😮you orob wanna call back
Bill: I was just talking to Meg about the crowds at Katsu, and I said "it was the first time anyone ever asked if 'was okay'". 

Tangentially... I wonder if it's a bad thing I can't really remember any other times like that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yes yes it is 😥
Bill: That could go two ways I realize, bad because first time anyone asked (which is pretty obviously bad), or bad because I don't let my discomfort show through much (which is more of a toss up).
Elfriede (Tom): Probably the second
Bill: I was thinking the second, but the first one may have been how Georgia read it. whoops.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Whoops
Afina (Georgia🍀): I see you meant the second but I took it as the first
Bill: they're connected tho.
Bill: whiiiich probably means the latter is bad.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah they are connected, people can't be concerned for you if they don't think anything is wrong
Bill: I should work on that I guess.
