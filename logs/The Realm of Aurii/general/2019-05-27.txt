Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): What she got against turkey huh

Elfriede Faun (Tom): But she's used to going places and just not eating
Nokri (Marisa): really? :0 i think she was eating sushi at zenkaikon so sushi is ok for her
Nokri (Marisa): no sushi at my party though rip. maybe candy sushi?
but we already have a lot of dessert options
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm not sure her restrictions, I think she's just hardcore naturalist
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Like no.processed stuff
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I wouldn't worry about it
Aldus Larian (Jess): shes just into like organic
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is she even invited?
Nokri (Marisa): ~~I don't think i invited her because i didn't think she would be interested in going but if she wants to come she totally can~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Who wouldn't be interested? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): inviting people was so much easier in high school
when i'd sell girl scout cookies out of my locker so people would flock there, and i could just be like "hey u know anna right? ur invited to my party"
and then i'd have to go find anna and be like "anna was that your boyfriend or did i invite some random dude to attend my party with you" and she'd be like "ya that's my bf" and i'd be like "great, disaster averted"
Nokri (Marisa): i've been getting the hiccups a lot am i dying

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but that plethora of accounts makes me think otherwise
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They all have the same pictures posted
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I want you all to know, while you wasted time talking to FEmales, I studied the Nerf‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Bill: And.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaoo

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was pretty lit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm probably gonna donate most of my stash because I doubt I‚Äôd use them and some 8 year old boy could have a blast with them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm gonna keep my two magnums and the one clear one (that was my MAIN SQUEEZE)
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Moving really sucks but there‚Äôs something freeing about getting rid of the stuff you honestly don‚Äôt use
