秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m the only person in the building who recycles womp womp
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): People tell me my various stages of exhaustion are a cursed blessing and in this one moment of lucidity I understand. I understand everything it’s so clear to me now.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Political cartoons are a thing because they predate common photography and use of actual pictures in daily newspapers so they provided a comedic and simplified version of explaining current events through a visual medium, and remained a constant to this very day just like newspapers themselves.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): omg I just found a pair of matching socks on the ground aww yis
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Are they wrapped?
Bill: I'm having this issue with trying to use my desktop a little more.
Bill: On the mac, I use every app in full screen pretty much, asides file browsers and terminals. OSX has a fancy 'swipe between full screen apps' feature so it works well, the apps fill the screen, is nice.

My monitor on my desktop is 24" or so. It's not big enough to split applications side by side, but too big for full screen apps, because half the screen is dead space.
Bill: This is... a conundrum.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): The socks? Are just laying there on the ground about 4 feet away from each other
The books? Naw, recycling law says you have to wrap magazines/books/paper/cardboard piles with string so I tied some thick string around it

Open many many small applications at the same time. 15 internet tabs but they’re all in their own window open on the desktop.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): #firstworldproblems
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh I meant the socks
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ~~I was thinking that too hehehe~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like if they were in a package, you could take um
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Naw the socks are just chilling. I know they’re clean because they’re not in the bathroom.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): OH they’re my socks. I hope. They’re next to my bed and they look like my socks.
Bill: ~~time to return some gifts~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Sometimes when I’m lazy I just dump dry clothes on the ground before going to put another load of wash in instead of just putting it away
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What a mood
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I just went through my whole night routine of taking out recycling and stewing myself in water, plus it’s still dark out so I feel ready for bed but it’s 6:30am. Freaky.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nap time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Christmas nap

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Aww that's so nice
Bill: God you could put that on anything and I'd love it.
