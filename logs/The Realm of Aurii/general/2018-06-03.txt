Bill: 5 people in the party don’t want to kill the hostages, so the evil guy and ^ that one are arguing about how they want to kill them, because they want to have them dead but don’t want to in cold blood. Meanwhile the other 5 are like if you’re not going to do, don’t do we can have another plan. (The other 5 left so the evil ones can “release” the hostages.)
