El🆓de Faun (Tom): Not even an article
Bill: I got an email, I'm on their mailing list cause I bought my big pocketknife in store.
Bill: I saw another Classic SD design going for 23.99?
Bill: So I'd guess something similar to that.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Huh yeahh although some limited edition are hella expense
Bill: ngl they'd be smart to jack up prices given pride's in town.
Bill: http://links.victorinox.mkt7081.com/servlet/MailView?ms=NDAwNzk2MDES1&r=ODEyNzA2NDA3OTA3S0&j=MTU0MjQzODI4OAS2&mt=1&rt=0
Bill: Going to the store was great cause I had no idea knives like mine existed.
Bill: 
Bill: ~~the picture is SUPER misleading though cause it looks thin and it's not at ALL~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~I called a girl cute like one take can i have one?~~
Nokri (Marisa): yet another unrealistic expectation for knives
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~thats not tru i call girls cute all the time but~~
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ~~jess you drunkenly called me hot at your party and it made me tear up, you get an honorary pride knife~~

Aldus Larian (Jess): thats just a blunt weapon at that point
Aldus Larian (Jess): like its got all these gadgets but could bludgeon someone to death with it
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Swiss army brick
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Who threw the first swiss army brick at stonewall?
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO

Bill: ooooo I'm getting better at sharpening my knife...
Bill: woo I sharpened this old knife I found at the shore one year and didn't ruin the edge!
Bill: Knife sharpening requires precise hand options to keep the angle right against the stone and I'm not good at that kind of thing so it's an accomplishment for me.
Bill: I'm still too scared to sharpen my grandfather's fishing knife.
Bill: It's too important to fuck up.
Aldus Larian (Jess): d-do you fish?
Bill: Nah. Nor could I ever imagine scaling a fish.
Bill: It's just important cause it was my grandfathers.
Bill: Nor do I need it sharp cause I wouldn't use it lol
Bill: But there's something about keeping your knife sharp that feels *right*.
Bill: Anyone want a pocket knife?
Bill: I have more knives than I actually need too... oops.
Aldus Larian (Jess): y tho?
Nokri (Marisa): thwart assassination attempts
Bill: Well... one's boy scouts, and mom kept it somewhere until I got the merit badge then promptly forgot about it till I was 20... So I got the middle knife... I have no idea where the dark red one came from... The big one on the top left was my carry about knife in college, then I moved on to the one with the blade out.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Idk where i put mine
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🤔
Bill: The smol brown one is the one from the shore that's just unique and cool.
Bill: basically some of these have been around for a decade and barely used (I didn't carry one till college) and it's pretty easy to misplace your knife if you aren't used to carrying it.
Nokri (Marisa): my college knife was much more discreet
Nokri (Marisa): did you use it often
Aldus Larian (Jess): y u need so many tho
Bill: I don't. I just haven't gotten rid of them.
Bill: They sit in a drawer with the sharpener.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Mine has my name engraved
El🆓de Faun (Tom): So I mean I'm sure I have it
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea I think i know where it is babe
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Woo!
Bill: But you know. They are KNIVES, with my fingerprints and shit on them. If I just throw them out and someone gets stabbed I'mma get arrested.
Bill: I doubt I'll ever switch from the one I carry tho.
Bill: Oh and I use it here and there Marisa.
Bill: Opening boxes, the wine cork occasionally, the screw drivers frequently...
Nokri (Marisa): o i meant in a fight
Bill: Oh yes, back when me and Andrew fought people under the sketchy water tower.
Bill: Good times.
Bill: We were undefeated.
Nokri (Marisa): my college knife was exclusively for blood
Nokri (Marisa): yo that's awesome
Nokri (Marisa): good times
Bill: *blood?*
Nokri (Marisa): yeah what's the point of a discreet knife if not stabbing
Bill: you mean. like self defense.
Nokri (Marisa): ye i had my knife and my brass knuckles
Nokri (Marisa): like this
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): for blood
