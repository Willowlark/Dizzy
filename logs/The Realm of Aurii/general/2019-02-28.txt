Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yo church music can be lit 🔥
Bill: It can, but like. This song was not.
Bill: Total buzz kill.
Bill: Today may be a good day, my favorite jerky was half off at cvs.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Canticle of the Turning" was always a choir favorite in high school. Mostly because the tune is a traditional Irish tune and Irish folk music is dope
Bill: I don't know what this thingy on my desk with the company logo is, but I love it.
Bill: I love swag.
Bill: OOOOH it's a popsock.et.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so turns out our emails not working was partially my fault
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoops
Bill: Good work.
Bill: *And?*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "once"?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): unrealistic
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): only once, def a lie
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was sending a customer an email regarding those plugs that kept breaking (turns out we'd been over-tightening them all along) and I took video to show our process. So I sent the email with about 250MB of video attachments and it maxed out the remaining space from our Outlook server
Bill: I dunno if I ever have, tbh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can only send thing under 20 MB
Bill: Last time I cried for a show was Clannad afterstory because *that shit like pepper spray for the heart*.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you can "go offline", delte it from your outbox, ad then go back online and you should be ok
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We got it working since. I deleted it and my boss defragged everything and now we're all supposed to go through our emails and delete old/unneeded emails to clear out some space
Bill: Oh the new hires don't know how to be on the same conference call in the same room.
Bill: They getting scolded by IBM lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe you sholud help them?
Bill: Can't while they're on the call. They need to hear what's going on.
Bill: I would have explained the same thing IBM did, probably will still tell them 'when in doubt mute mic', but IBM got to it first.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Just deleted 2017 old work emails...
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 3 wholly different moods
N🆗ri (Marisa): if humans had thorns would we still shake hands
N🆗ri (Marisa): not a philosophical question just like, if human skin was like a pineapple skin how would we interact differently
Elfriede Faun (Tom): The only 3 moods
Bill: Three people were like “its a pop socket dude”. Clearly the key to engagement is to be dumb.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel like if we had thorns people would wear a lot more togas or boxes
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooo this is weird. ooo this is really strange. cool but freaky i don't like it but my stalker side appreciates it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): DAMN THATS CRAY
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye i'm watchin them drive around bellmawr
i wonder if they can see me seeing them, like if it says "xx customer is now watching you!" 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): *no pressure*
Bill: Ah fuck.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mood
Bill: Gord got it in his head we should do photos and introduction paragraphs so IBM knows who we are. I forgot cause I was busy working for them, I wanted to take a decent, recent photo.
Aldus Larian (Jess): take a selfie with akissey face and a peace sign
Bill: Yeah def.
Bill: In a bathing suit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA

Bill: *sends this in*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEAH

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pretty sure drunk me spelled lipstick wrong

Aldus Larian (Jess): That's ok, it's one of a kind
Bill: *or one of a million selfies with Georgia...*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "lispack Giraffe"
Bill: But I should probably use this cause it my slack avatar.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats a good one 😮
Bill: It's just weird in the summer, cause I see my icon and think "that coat will kill me if I put it on". XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I now have a new picture for Bumble
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is it screaming kiri-oh thats even BETTEr
Bill: *put that shit in NSFW <:BOI:549661126141411351> I ain't explaining that to my coworkers* XD
Bill: ~~I don't actually care but~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): be like "i'm still looking for a profile pic"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was like, *where's nsfw?* and then I remembered in this server it's called "bobbies physics"
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's where we do science
Bill: It used to cycle frequently.
N🆗ri (Marisa): amazon delivery person has been sitting in a parking lot in bellmawr with my package for 2 hours. gimme the goods.

N🆗ri (Marisa): these guys. i want one. i want a life sized one.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i want all the botw children but rito are my favorites

Aldus Larian (Jess): I should have gotten more done today but all the idea maker is broken
N🆗ri (Marisa): have u tried turning it off and on again

Aldus Larian (Jess): also my boss is out and he calls here when hes away to make sure we are all here and doing our job
Aldus Larian (Jess): he'll call this time of day to make sure we didnt leave early
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's when you set up an elaborate fake to answer for you
Aldus Larian (Jess): that seems like alot of work
N🆗ri (Marisa): more work than work? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's the embodiment of american ingenuity
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's how our country's gotten this far
Aldus Larian (Jess): def more work than work
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's why we have webcams
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh I just updated my March calendar
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s got like nothing on it except work and Zenkai
Bill: You can easily fix that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's everyone cosplaying for st patricks day
Bill: Assuming you’re saying you don’t have enough to do, not all you’re doing is working.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean all I’m doing is work and school and Zenkai lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~a drunk gurl~~
Bill: Wooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hope one of the bars has a lavender drink

Aldus Larian (Jess): well i think were doing that thing this weekend, since the 17th is sunday
N🆗ri (Marisa): *you have a facebook group for drinking?????*
N🆗ri (Marisa): 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮 👮

N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I’ll still go out for st paddy’s on Saturday, but it’ll be like a local place. No crawling.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This weekend? Not 16th?
Bill: But we don’t have a plan for it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ah the crawl is this weekend
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea the event is this weekend
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Big sad, I’ll be studying, pour one out for me lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill be lucky is i can get tom to ONE drinking event theres no way hell agree to 2
N🆗ri (Marisa): no pouring one out unless it's a vat of vinegar and you're making pickles
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Well Saturday the 16th could just be dinner
Bill: If there’s some weekend you have free you want to come visit, you just have to say so.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~chili’s is Irish right~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have Sunday the 3rd, 10th, and 17th free
Bill: Yup. Bar crawl is more than enough drinking adventures for the month. We can find something to do and happen to have a beer while doing it instead.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The 31st too but I think that gets close to exams
N🆗ri (Marisa): your exams start in march? :0
or early april nvm that makes more sense
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Most STEM classes have not a midterm but two
Bill: So you have every Sunday free.
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH midterms not finals
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I have midterms this week and next week, then a month out, and then a month out from there is finals
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah every Sunday except Zenkai lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh wait not the 3rd that’s when I’m studying
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 10, 17, possibly 31
Bill: Still too cold for shooting I’d think, but. I’m at least free all of those.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wondering if I should try to take off a random Saturday too but idk...
Bill: Had talked about a city trip... though probably when warmer.
Dizzy: You should choose  productivity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): !choose league, productivity
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Goddammit dizzy
N🆗ri (Marisa): what happen to dizzy's emoji :0
Bill: We never used it. Saves space.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ok dizzy ill be productive THEN play league
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~or the other way around~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ugh skin is so weird
N🆗ri (Marisa): if humans were fruit would we taste better with or without skin
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): we use fruit for our lotions but is there lotion for fruit to give fruit better skin
Bill: Pick a weekend and we’ll figure it out. Just spending time together is enough when it’s good friends.
Bill: Oh. I did want to try running a rwby tabletop as a one shot.
Bill: Maybe that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH MY AMAZON PACKAGE IS ON THE MOVE
N🆗ri (Marisa): THEY LEFT THAT DEAD END STREET IN BELLMAWR
N🆗ri (Marisa): after 5 hours <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is exciting
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh you know what i could make a new maid uniform with all that black fabric i have. i was gonna make cosplay pajamas or a kigu or something but it'd make a nice custom maid uniform.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a whole bolt what else to make
Bill: Speaking of lewd costumes.
Bill: We can do Maki at next or something, zenkai going to be too busy with your staff work.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *how is it lewd*
yee the next hotel is nice
Bill: Ye and overpriced.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Speaking of lewd costumes...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My cosplay for Mangoloo's April Fool's thing came in today
N🆗ri (Marisa): what that?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh lawd he comin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How do you have that ability to see where they are? I've never seen that before
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk i think this is the second time it's ever shown up for me. i chose next-day shipping but it never shows up when i do 2-day shipping
N🆗ri (Marisa): usually comes with the regular mail so this may be for amazon-only package deliverers?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably has to do with the next day shipping. I don't think I've ever selected that before because it costs more money
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sometimes it's free with prime!
Bill: Is she cosplaying noodles or something?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nope it's a different theme
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But it's secret
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But oh ho is the concept cursed
Bill: *I don’t like not knowing things*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): |isnt it star wars themed?|
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Rip
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): |except all the characters get slave outfits except Leia|
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk How spoilers works I hope I did it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Idk how they work either
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think we both failed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): FUCK
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||you need two||
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oop
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Woops
Bill: How is that April fools...
Bill: Eh.
Bill: Cute.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Is there a way to make gallery photos spoilers?
Bill: I do appreciate her using her power only for good.
Bill: On desktop it gives you a checkbox.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I appreciate how she's branching out from Ruby to do memes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not on desktop so fuck it
Bill: Casey is a good famous person.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Look at this monstrosity
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Omfg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YES
Bill: I’d like to be her friend, but I also don’t believe I could get through her public persona and friend walls to be a real friend. Those are all justified, for the record. But I’m just not. Interesting. To make friends with her, nor do I have the patience to prove my trustworthiness to her while dealing with her public persona.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I spent like $50 on this shit 😂
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Idk she seems to just pick people at random
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She decided I'm her friend
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And I didnt do anything except talk to her in yang
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You also did Predator with her Alien so that probably did it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And get excited together
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh that was after though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ooohh
Bill: I am skipping a shower and a pair of sweatpants from looking like a grade A con creep tho so <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She screams "DAD" when I'm dressed as Tai but other than that we don't really interact that much
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like she added me to her friend chat room with her close friends before that and invites me to room with them for rtx and stuff
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And I was just like " wat"
Bill: Wow.
Bill: You have a strange power.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm just overly friendly and excited maybe ?? Like a puppy??
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow that's a gorgeous c3po
Bill: ~~I dunno but use that power to make us some more single people squad members.~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Actual dog, leanna
Bill: I have the unnatural ability to only meet couples.
Bill: Which will be GREAT when I’m forty and need someone for wine cheese and Pictionary.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I know a lot of gay singles xD
Bill: Ah yes, the other way it doesn’t work.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Also Kurto is more doggo than you.
