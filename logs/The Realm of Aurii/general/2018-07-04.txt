d his school did an international day and he sent me the pictures of the japan class and it's cute and they put a lot of effort into it but a lot of stuff is incorrect and i fear the school getting backlash for 'cultural appropriation' and whatnot
*they tried ok*
Elfriede (Tom): YEAH ME TOO
 
and oof, yeah.. if it gets enough popularity maybe,  otherwise it'll just be over looked
Nokri (Marisa): it's funny because their clothing is from every asian country except japan
and on the board they wrote "fun facts" but they translated it literally into japanese so it reads more like "amusing reality"
Nokri (Marisa): except the one kid in a sick ninja costume i hope he got an a

Nokri (Marisa): a classic case of everyone liking the side girls better than the main girl <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): Oooof
Elfriede (Tom): See I was that way with shuffle
Elfriede (Tom): But then the side girl.ebded up being the main girl and really bamboozled me
Elfriede (Tom): I was not ready
Nokri (Marisa): BAMBOOZLED
Nokri (Marisa): I tried explaining to someone today (in the conversation practice event thing) that my sister is married to a girl and they were not getting it. 
They asked about my family and I started talking about my sister and they were like ‚Äúis she married?‚Äù And im like yeah her and her wife have two kids
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh her husband‚Äù
I‚Äôm like ‚Äúnaw her wife.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs called a husband‚Äù
I was like ‚Äúno my sister married a woman‚Äù
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh. So your sister isn‚Äôt married?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo she‚Äôs married to a woman. She has a wife.‚Äù 
I think he finally understood and just changed topics hehe
Nokri (Marisa): Japanese people find my family insane. They say it sounds like a soap opera. Americans find it believable but also pretty crazy.
Elfriede (Tom): oh woww
Elfriede (Tom): the lack there of understanding because of up bringing is strong
Elfriede (Tom): why.... did i just look in my fridge, wonder where the milk was
Elfriede (Tom): then the first thought through my head is
Elfriede (Tom): Oh did Marisa finish it?
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs that suggestion that jess made about cookies and milk. That revolutionized my life I‚Äôm sorry it was necessary.
Aldus (Jess): I can't believe marisa drank all the milk
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.homestuck.com/images/storyfiles/hs2/02216_2.gif
Elfriede (Tom): WTF DID I JUST COME BACK  TO
Elfriede (Tom): OHH
Elfriede (Tom): THATS A CUP THAT JUUST BROKE
Elfriede (Tom): NOt...
Elfriede (Tom): hmm
Aldus (Jess): THOMAS
Elfriede (Tom): >Why is **Marisa** sharing this lewd art... I must be seeing this wrong
>Gets closer to computer, .....okay i was sseeing it wrong but just barely
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
OF COURSE ITS A CUP WHAT ELSE WOULD JT BE
Elfriede (Tom): A BOWL
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe a test tube but like you know how unsafe those are to look directly into
Nokri (Marisa): Orly
Nokri (Marisa): https://www.homestuck.com/story/2216
Elfriede (Tom): im glad the saggitarius boi vacuumed it up tho
Nokri (Marisa): of course. someone as noble as equius can't have spilled and evaporating milk distracting him from archery
https://www.homestuck.com/images/storyfiles/hs2/02218.gif
Elfriede (Tom): **why is his room filled with pictures of furries with through peens out**
Nokri (Marisa): WAIT ARE YOU READING HOMESTUCK
HOW FAR ARE YOU GOING
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY EQUIUS ISN'T THE ONE WITH FURRY STUFF HE'S ALL ABOUT HORSES
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH SEE HORSES
Elfriede (Tom): HORSES YEAH
Elfriede (Tom): so like i read like 30 in, dead in the middle
Elfriede (Tom): and Nepeta Leijon is the best character
Elfriede (Tom): clearly
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): nepeta is definitely the best
Nokri (Marisa): though her dead/partially fused with other people selves are also arguably good
Bill: I‚Äôm sure there were many lewd references in homestuck.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): tom start homestuck from the beginning
Nokri (Marisa): poor, sweet fefetasprite.
Elfriede (Tom): hmmm so like
Elfriede (Tom): idk if itas just where you dropped me
Elfriede (Tom): but its most of it on the computers?
Nokri (Marisa): they're playing a computer game, sburb (or sgrub in the troll's case)
and the computer game destroys their world
the place where equius is introduced above is the backstory of how the trolls started their game before our (the human) universe was created
so the game starts with computers but as you level up and get experience it becomes real life
Nokri (Marisa): here's page one OwO
https://www.homestuck.com/
Nokri (Marisa): it does start slow, because it was a choose your own adventure game running off of forums before it evolved into its own tale
Nokri (Marisa): ~~*tom's gonna cosplay nepeta*~~
Elfriede (Tom): she made him have happy thoughts <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): who, equius? yeah they moirails
Nokri (Marisa): <>
Nokri (Marisa): OH or are you talking about vriska
Elfriede (Tom): yee
Elfriede (Tom): https://www.homestuck.com/images/storyfiles/hs2/02400.gif

i dont know what the different symbols relate to
Elfriede (Tom): but the vibrated cat makes me happy
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH!! THEY MOIRAILS!!!
omg did you read like 200 pages
Elfriede (Tom): when did he stop allowing people to contribute on the forums?
Elfriede (Tom): i.... maybe? i def didnt read everything tho
Nokri (Marisa): hmmm. maybe around when the trolls were made? he took name suggestions for them, and then reused names that weren't chosen for future charactesr
Elfriede (Tom): ahhhh yeah that makes sense
Elfriede (Tom): how long is it?
Nokri (Marisa): in a nutshell, according to fandom,
‚ù§ is romantic love like humans
‚ô¶  is platonic bff friendship
‚ô† is hate-love. like. you hate someone with such an intense passion that you sleep with them? but trolls reproduce differently. we're not getting into that.
‚ô£ is a wingman who stops you from killing your ‚ô† and who you vent to
Nokri (Marisa): is long
Nokri (Marisa): like, you might be able to finish in 3 days if you do literally nothing else but read
Elfriede (Tom): lmao i mean
Elfriede (Tom): 70% of them are like 1 sentence or less
Nokri (Marisa): yeah a lot are really short, most are even just pictures.
Nokri (Marisa): then you get SUPER LONG EXPOSITION
Elfriede (Tom): yee
Elfriede (Tom): :33
Nokri (Marisa): and then there's kankri
Elfriede (Tom): MASHES CLOSE COVERSTAION
Elfriede (Tom): TLDR
Nokri (Marisa): :33< 3333!! it would be purrfect fur you to read homestuck :33c
Nokri (Marisa): you gotta get used to the ridiculous typing styles
Nokri (Marisa): like nepeta prefaces all her sentences with :33<
and any double e is written as 33
and her emoji use two mouths
and she types cat puns
Nokri (Marisa): feferi writes H's like )(
and uses lots of fish puns except when she's angry
and when she's excited she'll turn her E's into little tridents LIK-E THIS!
Nokri (Marisa): and then meulin and kurloz communicate via gifs
don't read homestuck if you have epilepsy maybe
Nokri (Marisa): but otherwise do it :33c
Elfriede (Tom): lmao
Elfriede (Tom): i do not have epilepsy
Nokri (Marisa): TOM GONNA READ HOMESTUCK: CONFIRMED
Nokri (Marisa): JESS GET IN ON THIS
Nokri (Marisa): me if tom and jess read homestuck

Elfriede (Tom): no promises :33
Elfriede (Tom): but why does he haev to use the cards above the arms ü§î  **this is mildly irritating**
Nokri (Marisa): he must retrieve his arms
Nokri (Marisa): time to draw nepeta fanart after all these years
Elfriede (Tom): lmao
Elfriede (Tom): i will say i like the choose your adventure and point and click callout outs
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Nani is tom reading HOMESTUCK
