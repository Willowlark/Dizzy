Elfriede Faun (Tom): There it is
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Jared suddenly announces his move to back NJ
Bill: only good to come of the change.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I mean decriminalization I think is a good idea
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Putting people in jail over weed is silly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that I agree with
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): honestly, the only reason being around weed makes me uncomfortable is *because* it's illegal so if it gets decriminalized then it basically becomes my same issues with regular smoking which are just that I find it gross
Elfriede Faun (Tom): From a position that I stand (not consuming any regulated substances) alcohol tobacco and weed are the same to me
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah exactly
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Weed is more uncomfortable cuz it illegal
Bill: mm. Weed also just makes you dumb, flat out... Alcohol can be done in moderation, and... I don't even know what the psychological effect of smoking is.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I really don't know all of the hazards of smoking it, but like, if it just makes you dopey or mellowed out then what's really the difference than getting buzzed or drunk?
Bill: Was talking about it yesterday, you can have one beer and be mostly unaffected. You can't have 1 weed and not feel the effect.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): true
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But you can have 1 shot
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Same same
Bill: I'm not really affected by one shot, but for some people yeah.
Bill: The point is alcohol is a sliding scale, weed is more of a switch.
Bill: That's a very different sliding scale for different people, but I'm not giggling at the thought of the Dexter's Lab logo for an hour after a beer at lunch.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But you also can't get weed posoining and die in one go
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Maybe we should just ban everything to be sure <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Snow had me try weed once, I didnt feel anything. Just super tired? But I'm pretty sure that also because it was 2am
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So idk. I dont really get weed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't get the appeal. It smells awful
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have never had a weed
Bill: mhmm. I just can't get over how stupid it made people in freshman year of college.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea it does smell awful
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And yes people do tend to just get really stupid
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Not really sure why it's so popular
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): On the other hand CBD is calming without the stupidity
Bill: My brain may constantly drive me insane, but I'd rather be intelligent and in control than not.
Bill: > Me: Tom and Jess didn't go away to school, I wonder how much experience they had with people smoking (it's a dorm life ritual)
> Me: *Facepalm*
> *Jared*
Bill: I'm dumb.
Aldus Larian (Jess): jared doesnt smoke around us
Aldus Larian (Jess): the only experience i really have is hanging out with my friend brother, his friends and they all smoked
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also Jared is easier to beat in fighting games drunk then high <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~more experience in one than the other~~
Bill: Though, I see that. Alcohol does hit motor skills after a point.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): He had more exp drinking actually
Bill: ~~is you kicking his ass when drunk why he switched to weed primarily~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaoo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nah he says drinking makes him feel less in control of himself
Bill: I'm trying out rearranging my desk a bit...
Bill: I hate this desk sometimes.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I see a lot of people our age making a lifestyle out of weed over alcohol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hence why it makes them dumb
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~or both~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tru tho the alcohol peeps usually make a lifestyle of partying
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which tends to include both
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): How about neither
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): THERES A CAT WIMMING IN THE PIKL
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): wait nvm itâ€™s a duck
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): False alarm

Aldus Larian (Jess): yime for a swim
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Heâ€™s diving what is he diving for
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): What are you doing
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I think heâ€™s done
Aldus Larian (Jess): he is done with bog bath
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): *get out of my swamp*
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Now he stands at its edge staring at his reflection and pondering life
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Understandable
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): he's gone.................
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Rip

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): cats are waiting for ducks to get out so they can eat their lunch
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): noooooooooooooooooo
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): **they're getting out**
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): one of the cats started stalking something in the other direction and ran off screen
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): THE CAT IS BACK
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): the ducks flew away!! they're safe!!!!
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): update

NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): they're playing it's very cute
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's adorable
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i can only access nsfw on my phone right now because work computer and my phone is at 1% <:lenny:395307171539189760>
but the top is like a black mesh over the shoulders and then from the chest down it's a very bright galaxy print. sleeveless.
the skirt has a sparkly black waistband and i think a layer of sparkly black tulle over the galaxy print
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i find and take pictures later
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): now the ducks are laying down next to the pool and there are two cats napping on a bin

Aldus Larian (Jess): ICE CREAM?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): BoJo just sprinted out the door so maybe???
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Usually they pedal drugs though and the ice cream is bad and they donâ€™t know how to scoop it
