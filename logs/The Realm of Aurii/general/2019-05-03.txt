Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like crit role is interesting and I could probably get into it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I like the “character that’s just trying to be good” type
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And that seems to be Yasha I think is her name
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But fandom seems to boil her down to just “gay” and that’s it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is sad cause characters are more dynamic than their orientation
Bill: sure?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jester looks like a mischievous cutesy character
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Beau also just seems like gay sokka
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nott looks cool but I imagine she’s problematic cause snow cosplays her lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ddfshfhjgjk
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LOL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'd get into crit role if there wasn't a bazillion hours to catch up on
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.facebook.com/events/586852891799123/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Throwing this here. I don't expect any of you to come because of the drive, but thought I'd at least invite y'all
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ooooo is this your band?
Bill: I didn't realize cause of the japanese owo.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah I don't know why the Japanese characters showed up in the preview? They're not there in the actual page? lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and ye
Bill: chrome keeps crashing on my work machine.
Bill: ,...
Bill: I removed the application, all of my profile settings, and reinstalled. It's still crashing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Theratears don’t burn <:woah:543194447345876998> bkess
Tikur (Kurtis): WOO! Am glad!
Tikur (Kurtis): How's your eye doing?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): not as twitchy and scratchy! <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> thank u sensei
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm listening to a video of kizuna ai taking an online english lesson and i guess my degree did do something because the teacher is making me silently weep
N🆗ri (Marisa): miss you can't say "at the moment" to a total beginner student, you gotta use easier language like "now" aaaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa good teacher
N🆗ri (Marisa): No u
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u
N🆗ri (Marisa): I came down to get started on Kagura so I can make the Itabag and someone is sleeping on the Pile
N🆗ri (Marisa): sHES NOT EVEN SLEEPING she just knows I need the pile and is pretending omg
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sneaky
N🆗ri (Marisa): None of these bobbins work <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oommmmhgg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): question for people who have more hotel booking experience: When you check in, you typically have to provide your credit card, right?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye, in case you trash the room in a wild party or get room service
N🆗ri (Marisa): fun fact: in japan they don't need a card but they do need your passport or foreign residency card to make a copy of
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): does it have to be the same credit card used to book the room?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): i.e. paying with company credit card but not having a physical copy
N🆗ri (Marisa): you shouldn't need a physical copy of the company's card in that case <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I can pay with company card and provide my own to check in?
N🆗ri (Marisa): in most cases yeah, unless it's joe's random bed and breakfast with 3 rooms
Bill: I can't remember exactly... Are you pre paying the whole room?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I guess?
Bill: Actually yeah, you should be fine to use a different card than the one on file.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I might just use my own and get ~~points~~ reimbursed
Bill: abso-fucking-lutely my guy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's a cheap room anyway
Bill: I drove 30 minutes when I stayed over at Armonk once, rather than a hotel minutes away so I could get an additional marriott rewards night on my account  on company dime.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): $95 for a queen suite for one night
Bill: cheap as hell.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): before taxes and fees
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which brings it up to $110
Bill: still cheap as hell.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): flight was about $312
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that was on the company card though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the expo is two days but they only want me to go to one so I made sure to choose the day that there's a mimosa bar
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the other day had a bloody mary bar but bloody marys are bleh
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): omg mimosas are so good, good choice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just forwarded an email from my work email to my personal email and it flagged it as spam 😂
Bill: Was anyone interested in Laundromat tonight @everyone ? I'm think of getting there around 8ish, if you were. Probably eat before that, idk where.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have a washer at home thanks
Bill: ~~that's good cause it's a bar~~
Bill: although part of me wants to do Recess.
Bill: idk.
Andrew: I'm down let me drive up there now
Bill: Don't troll me guy, it'd be really good to see you.
Andrew: I meant to strike through
Andrew: I really want to go though
Bill: mm. I need to come down soon too. ~~since you won't come up~~.
Andrew: Technical limitations
Andrew: I need to go up to get sushi as well with <@351785752197201920>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think I'm coming? I want to
Bill: cool.
Bill: Hmm. Why do I feel like there are better sushi places in south jersey?
Bill: Maybe cause we were just there for the japanese culture festival.
Andrew: I mean that pl place in berlin is really good
Andrew: New York sushi places any good?
Bill: Guy I don't eat sushi and you know it.
Andrew: Plus sagamis near me is a very good Japanese restaurant
Andrew: Like really good
Andrew: Its premium expensive tho
Andrew: But very very good quality
N🆗ri (Marisa): Volcano is cheap and really good
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I like the sushi around here but I wouldn't know I don't have a ton of places to compare it to
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know some good places in Tokyo
N🆗ri (Marisa): Gotta wait sometimes tho. 
Cheap $1 conveyor sushi or premium omakase made in front of you, both have waits depending on the day and time
Andrew: Well what are we waiting for
Andrew: Let's go
Glonk: What's the quality of that $1 sushi
N🆗ri (Marisa): Pretty good, big variety that tastes good and no one ever got sick from it. 
They have more expensive options but we mostly used it for post-cosplay dinner since most “cons” in japan are done by 3-4pm
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom just died on the couch so we'll see about the bar 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): might wanna relocate him before he decomps on the cushions
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea you right
Bill: mhmm.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wanna know weather I should do my hair and makeup to go out but idk how long boi gonna sleep
N🆗ri (Marisa): the longer he sleeps the fancier you become
Bill: Couldn't tell you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn I was hoping you could
Bill: oh sorry my trope is I know everything, lemme check... Ah yes, Tomu only sleeps in 2.5 hour increments but he'll be super hype as soon as he wakes up cause of a dream he'll have about <:lenny:395307171539189760> and want to go.
Aldus Larian (Jess): If he has a dream about <:lenny:395307171539189760> he's not going to wanna go anywhere
Bill: If *any* of that is right, I'll give myself the role "Ugly Zen".
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wtf does that even mean
Bill: Cause Zen like, dreamed the future or whatever they called it.
Bill: ~~but if he happens to wake up and feel amiable to DDing I wouldn't mind not having to think about driving home~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'll be lucky if he wants to take *me* 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I'll mention it if he arises
Bill: Whatchu doing. I'mma publish this, eat, and head out fairly soon.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@351785752197201920>  what say you
Elfriede Faun (Tom): No clue
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I suppose we going?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dunno if we'll wanna stay as long as you tho
Bill: so long as I have time for a few of whatever those fantastic drinks were at our bar crawl, I'm fine.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Dont get too lit <:pew:543202259085950996>  be safe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Me and kurto died
Bill: I was there.
Bill: It's your call if you want to give me a lift.
Bill: But imma leave in 10 if not so tell ma.
Andrew: Take my cutout with you
