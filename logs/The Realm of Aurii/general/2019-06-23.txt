Bill: Jen’s hook you up if you want.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777>
Nokri (Marisa): main issue is i prefer inline skates
Bill: Ooooh. No one was using those now that you say that, is that a rule?
Nokri (Marisa): quads are more maneuverable and more stable than inlines
Nokri (Marisa): easier to push someone over on inlines
unless i nyoom out of the way
Nokri (Marisa): i wore quads for cosplaying neon and it was easier to maneuver but inlines feel more natural to me
Bill: I’m sure you could do it.
Bill: You should try and be as stable as possible lol
Nokri (Marisa): i'd go to heel break and fly into the sun
Bill: Join them!
Bill: Jen’ll hook you up!
Nokri (Marisa): i haven't broken any bones though and i want to keep that
Bill: THAT is a concern of mine with you valid tbh
Bill: But there’s a girl about your size on the team.
Nokri (Marisa): size doesn't matter, roller derby is a very bone-breaking sport
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Inlines superior
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏
Bill: Jen and her friend say no one has broken a bone to date.
Bill: And Jen says hi
Nokri (Marisa): h-hewwo fwiend
my sister and her teammates would break their bones constantly
Nokri (Marisa): usually leg bones, once my sister broke her arm
Nokri (Marisa): at least once a month someone would get a big injury
Nokri (Marisa): they practiced weekly idk how often their games were
Bill: That seems verrrry different. Different league maybe.
Bill: Trust Jen!
Nokri (Marisa): trust no one not even your shelf
Bill: Only broken bone was an ankle cause of stupidity.
Bill: I don’t trust shelves but I trust Jen.
Bill: She one of my Nakama like Aurii.

Nokri (Marisa): ooooooomg
Nokri (Marisa): so every year my aunt puts on a dance recital
Nokri (Marisa): a few of my aunts own dance schools but this one aunt in particular. omg
Nokri (Marisa): her recitals are INSANE. insane. they go on FOREVER.
we usually help out selling 50/50 tickets and concessions but i stayed home this year because medical procedures woo, so bojo went by herself. she left at 4 because the recital started at 5 and she had to be there to hand out programs when people entered. she said she was gonna leave after the intermission because after that her help isn't needed anymore.

**The recital started at 5:00pm and they're just now starting the intermission**
i can't with this aunt anymore omg
Nokri (Marisa): she just texted like "i'm leaving in 30 minutes" and i was like "oh did you decide to stay for the whole show?" and she's like "no the intermission just started" adjfykyjgshjfkgj
