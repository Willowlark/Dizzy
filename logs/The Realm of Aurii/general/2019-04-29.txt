Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Why not try some wine if you can't sleep?"* 🍷
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _plot twist bill was romancing jumin the whole time??_
Bill: I already did that, did you miss it entirely?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i meant in real life <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Me and jumin would be terribly incompatible.
Bill: Not that there’s any evidence to go off of, but there’s no evidence of compatible either.
Bill: Hypothesis is the one where you just guess the result right.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You could bond over spending money excessively
Bill: We’re too similar.
Bill: We’d compete to buy things for each other.
Bill: Bidding war against each other.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And get drunk off wine
Bill: Shit all I gotta do is lock someone in my pent house.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I love how "neither of us are gay" played a part here

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Does Billy Clark is gay?
Bill: Please no my chances with women are already abysmal I don’t need that playing into it too.

Andrew: Fianlly seeing endgame tomorrow
Andrew: finalllyy
Tikur (Kurtis): Woo!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmonday
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): [airhorns]
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 😭 😭 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): http://time.com/5579256/avengers-endgame-biggest-opening-weekend/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Disney right now
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Disney: can't wait to not use any of this money on facial expressions for "Live action" Lion King!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is it true that Disney's making these remakes to extend the copyrights or whatever?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can't wait until literally every company is owned by Disney
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I, for one, welcome our mouse overlords
N🆗ri (Marisa): Originally i think it was, like Dumbo and Maleficent, but stuff like Mulan and lion king are much more recent. I thought the vault was how they kept their copyrights
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): idk I just heard it somewhere on the internet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so obviously it's true
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just wanted to make sure in case the internet was wrong, which I know is impossible
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah no point in even asking there's no way any misinformation exists online
N🆗ri (Marisa): trump had to ask how big of an event the succession of the emperor is in japan and he was like "how big is it compared to the super bowl"
<:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): at first I was like "ok, that's a valid thing to ask" and then I was like "oh, but that's a poor thing to try to compare it to..."
N🆗ri (Marisa): leanna goin' off on the ignorant tumblr masses so early in the morning 👏
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i hate tumblr users LMaO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like there are very good reasons to not like game of thrones, but the ones that circulate tumblr are so naive and immature that i just can't
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): some of these people needs to step outside sometime, or maybe browse ...educational websites instead of tumblr
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee omg some people get stuck in such a tumblr-centric loop and only see things in black and white
"how can homophobia exist if there are so many of us" tis because you never leave tumblr my friend
N🆗ri (Marisa): bad example but. i'll come up with a better one when this chat is long finished.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): no, yea i totally understand what you mean. There's such a closed-off -from-the-world fishbowl effect happening on tumblr
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and its really concerning because their outlook on the world is so skewed
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh ye boi
N🆗ri (Marisa): one of my nephew's favorite things to say is "oh no" so sometimes when you're near him you'll just hear a very quiet "oh nooooo" for the smallest things
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's like. 2. "oh no" is one of the few things he can coherently say
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh noooooo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 😱
N🆗ri (Marisa): a cloud goes over the sun and it becomes shady
"oh no"

a cheerio falls on the floor
"oh NO"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's amazing

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Spoiler, the movie is three hours long
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Spoiler, Iron man says the word "The"
N🆗ri (Marisa): remember lazer team

ahh, lazer team.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ahhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I didn't even bother withnit
N🆗ri (Marisa): probably for the best
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's funny because they knew it wasn't good and they still made a sequel
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hope AH does a Theater Mode of Lazer Team. That would be funny as hell
N🆗ri (Marisa): the sequel was real?? i remember talk about it but then i never followed up omg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazer_Team_2
Bill: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M64H5DK can anyone actually put this in their cart?
Bill: for 18.99?
Bill: It won't add to my cart and I want another one (two, three).
N🆗ri (Marisa): An 18.99 one doesn’t show up, just a $29.99 one
Might be sold out
Bill: fucking riiiip
Bill: I have ethernet in my room via the cable connection now.
Bill: Yeetmas.

Bill: Fuck I can’t get a poster frame for the 19x27.
Bill: Cause it’s a non standard size.
Bill: I also can’t remember if any of the smaller ones were 12x18.
Bill: Should I just buy a bunch of frames and hope for the best.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do you have a tape measure and or ruler?
Bill: Yeah I have a tape measure.
Bill: I measured some of them, but since I gave up on on the big one I needed the sizes of the ones I wasn’t going to hang.
Bill: Dad checked for me before we met at chili’s.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo ok didn't knoe you weren't home
Bill: Yeee.
Bill: We good. Except for where I spent 94 bucks on on frames.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
