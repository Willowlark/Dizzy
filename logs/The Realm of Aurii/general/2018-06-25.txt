Nokri (Marisa): Some say he’s still there
Bill: Yesterdays fanfics were angsty but very enjoyable shippy content. 

Today’s was supposed to be Weiss is forced to bring Jaune to a high society thing, and it ends up as a date. It turned into power struggles, Jaune being manipulated, Weiss being poisoned for social disgrace, and anything but sweet content.

Nokri (Marisa): There was a student doing research on turtles and wound up becoming the world leading expert on a particular species because they were reading a report and noticed something was odd about the species of turtle being described and it turned out that instead of the turtle it was supposed to be they had experimented on a totally new type of turtle
Nokri (Marisa): TLDR By writing about mythology you might become a turtle expert and country singer with a double life
