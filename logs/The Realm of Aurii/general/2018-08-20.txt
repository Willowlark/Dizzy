Nokri (Marisa): yee is a little pricey but they have good sales, especially when they're really trying to get rid of something that didn't sell well before. we were practically giving away shower curtains once.
they're an online-only store so i was a picker, we'd get the orders and i'd walk around the warehouse with a scanner gun finding the stuff that was ordered and pack it up in a box. it's a pretty small company, i got the job through my sister who did customer service and got the job through her friend who was a co-owner
