Bill: There was a time I wanted an escape. No longer, imma sleep on it but forester sport sounds like my car
Bill: The only brand I have a slight interest in looking at now is BMW, which 1) I would not get an suv 2) would be out of my price range for all the good toys.
Bill: So imma skip that.
Bill: So I’ve got Forester, Jeep is out (too rigid, even if it’s a solid car), ford is more chinsy than Subaru in the consumer market, not motivated to jump to luxury, and there’s no way I’d get a truck (both my commute and *like really?*) or motorcycle. I’ve covered my bases.
