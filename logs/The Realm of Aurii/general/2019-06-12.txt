Bill: Does a blind photographers work go up in value like a dead artists?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): eHarmony's latest stock image to advertise to me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeehaw
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like how she just has an American flag draped over her shoulder
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *as if that's a normal thing to do*
Bill: It probably cause you friends with us sussex county denizens.
Bill: They think you're into ~~redneck~~ farmer.
Tikur (Kurtis): One of us one of us one of us
Glonk: *old town road starts to play*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Seems fake but okay
Bill: you getting alot of ads tonight.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Man I can't believe they have girls who can *see*
Bill: I personally hate(d) the bumble notifications that were some kind of cheese about getting a date for the weekend like. Didn't need a notification for that.
Bill: Didn't need to think I'd actually matched.
Bill: Hooooope all these snark worthy things aren’t getting to you.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Taking bets on how many more messages until this conversation dies
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You gotta be inquisitive about them too and it'll *probably* last longer! 
Although I have no bumble experience and it may just die cuz that how it be
El🆓de Faun (Tom): *bee
Bill: He right though, asking questions is how you keep conversation going.
Bill: So I’ve read in books.
Bill: In practice it works sometimes.
Bill: They have to be willing to share and you have to come off curious/interested not noosy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *The plot thickens...*
Nokri (Marisa): oh honey i'm sorry but there are death flags all over this conversation 🙀
Nokri (Marisa): what show is that from. where they call everyone honey. it's stuck in my head and i can hear the voice but can't remember the show <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Bill: Am glad you getting hits tho.
Bill: Look for questions that require explaining. 

“Being a nurse must be hectic”
“Yeah”
“...”

“What do you do as a nurse? Do you work in particular department?”
“Yeah I work in pediatrics!”
“Oh cool do you like kids”
Etc
Nokri (Marisa): i think it's an episode of himym <:thinku:543194478614413318> 

this path could branch into two options!
"yeah, i'm always busy it sucks." = interest will be lost since no time for meeting up?
"i have free time!" = interested in meeting up?

but it's super early in the conversation for it to go down such a path so she'll likely say she's busy often and only try to arrange a meetup once the conversation goes deeper, which it might not because by saying she's busy she has shown herself to be disinterested <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I will keep you guys posted
Nokri (Marisa): [over-analyzes every little detail] she used punctuation,you see that? according to freud's psychoanalysis, that means
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The fact that she knows BNHA is a plus. I don't have a Kiri photo on my profile which means she browsed my linked Insta
Bill: I get where you’re going Marisa but if she wasn’t curious about him she didn’t have to message him at all.
Bill: Bumble women have to message first.
Bill: Oh duh. Ask her about BNHA.
Bill: Just chat a bit.
Nokri (Marisa): "what is your opinion on how the fandom has driven the plot, how the characters have been characterized now in contrast to their first appearance, and do you think this would all be different if horikoshi hadn't become incredibly successful to the point of overly rushing everything?"
Bill: Ye ye. Small talk guide: anchor (you both have interest in BNHA) reveal (you cosplay Kiri) so now encourage (“do you have favorite character?” “Oh I like them too, why they your favorite”).
Bill: ~~I’ve read methodology on small talk before; I’ve been trying people~~
Bill: https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/social-briefing-7-initiate-small-talk-using-method/
Nokri (Marisa): people like to talk about themselves
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > choosing photos to submit to <@!334090409389195266> 's zine
> ah yes, the solo shots from my *Black Sun* shoot should do nicely
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Kaio Vermino (Lee): LOL
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Ngl that's hilarious
Nokri (Marisa): If life is found on other planets and we made contact who would die first
Nokri (Marisa): I guess it really depends on a lot of stuff huh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah true
El🆓de Faun (Tom): How intelligent they are
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And if they are primitive animals you think we'll take some here?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): You bet we will
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also what are the changes they'll even have made it as far as us without world ending events
Nokri (Marisa): watch us get annihilated by unconscious single celled organisms because they exhale toxic poison
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): makes it host exhale poison too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But they don't die for a few days
Nokri (Marisa): scientist: [pokes a rock]
scientist: [dies a horrible death over the next 3 hours]
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Extremely contagious
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ITS POSSIBLE YO
Nokri (Marisa): wait i think this is a made in abyss chapter
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I SHOULDNT BE SURPRISED
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Although for them to have defence or paracitic mechanisms
El🆓de Faun (Tom): There would have to be other life
Nokri (Marisa): ooo tru
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Do you think plant life or animal life is more likely
Nokri (Marisa): maybe it's just coincidental
<:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): fungal maybe? i think most life on earth is fungal
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Probably fungal yea that's true
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Kinda in between
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Fungal is kinda animal like
El🆓de Faun (Tom): What about water bears
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I bet there everywhere
Nokri (Marisa): WATER BEARS
El🆓de Faun (Tom): They so strong
Nokri (Marisa): the biggest organism discovered so far on the planet is a mushroom (bunch of small mushrooms that are actually all the same living being) in oregon that covers ~4 miles
Nokri (Marisa): *what if earth is the organism*
Nokri (Marisa): *we're the water bears*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh like the Slime.molds?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): How they form the collumns
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Those are crazy yo
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And how they form a network , and someone was able to recreate a map of roads by mapping out the city locations as food and the slime mold created all the roads like a web
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And how it can LEARN TOO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Crazy
Glonk: https://youtu.be/OcPqk-O-fD4
Nokri (Marisa): marriages should be cheaper today
Nokri (Marisa): and days like today
Nokri (Marisa): wedsdays
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea! they are!  well idk if the actual licence is cheaper but weddings are
Nokri (Marisa): omg i should open a tarot stand
Aldus Larian (Jess): the licence is pretty cheap tho its like 28 dollars
Nokri (Marisa): im not good at parallel parking though
Aldus Larian (Jess): me neither
Nokri (Marisa): me neither
Nokri (Marisa): someone i know is getting married. we were invited to the wedding. it's in england. both of them are american and have lived in america their whole lives. we gotta pay $1500 per person to attend the wedding, not including gifts. why they gotta do that
Aldus Larian (Jess): do both of thier families live in america too mostly?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Damn brutal
Nokri (Marisa): yeah i don't think they have any relatives in europe
Nokri (Marisa): or any relatives that they know. maybe like a great great twice removed aunt or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): they just wanna be extra i guess
Aldus Larian (Jess): whos getting married?
Nokri (Marisa): the son of the woman who thinks i'm obsessed with twilight
Nokri (Marisa): if you can remember the party a few weeks ago, she was a bigger woman who relied on a walker to get around who sat at the table next to aurii, and her husband was the one with parkinsons
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo yea i think i remember?
Aldus Larian (Jess): if they arent super close to you i wouldnt sweat not being able to make it. also if they know your financial situation at all they shouldnt be offended
Nokri (Marisa): it's so weird because the groom to be used to be the stick of the family, everyone else is really overweight except for maybe his dad and then the groom to be was always SUPER thin, people always made jokes that he must be adopted or such. and then i didn't see him for a couple years recently and when i saw him again he was huuuge he looked like an irl inflation kink it was freaky
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~they just shouldnt be offended period, thats alot to ask of someone~~
Nokri (Marisa): i think they can only have like 25 guests max at their wedding too, it's a first come first served basis
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa thats so weird
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Woahhhhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): whoa, Americans getting married in England when all of their loved ones are in America.... that ups Ethan wanting everyone to come down to Texas for their wedding when literally all of their friends and family are in NJ/PA
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yweeahhh
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like that's fine, as long as you dont get offended when people can't make it.
Nokri (Marisa): yee. wouldn't it be better to honeymoon there instead of having the wedding there? i can get wanting a picturesque fantasy-like wedding but. i feel like a honeymoon would be better since a wedding is more for other people than the bride and groom
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea unless they're doing both there?
Nokri (Marisa): matching pencil cases for the squad

Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG YES
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YAAS
Nokri (Marisa): i somehow lost a ton of weight at AnimeNEXT so I think the secret to weight loss is Pringles, pizza, and Applebee’s leftovers
Nokri (Marisa): everyone try it
Bill: I have it doesn't work. 😭
Bill: Maybe it was stress?
Aldus Larian (Jess): increased physical activity?
Bill: OH yeah that
Nokri (Marisa): enough physical activity to push me under 100 pounds? how do I find the health app that shows how much you walk each day
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think on iphone its a little heart?
Nokri (Marisa): Naw I didn’t even walk over 30,000 steps the whole weekend. I’d do that in two regular days in japan
Aldus Larian (Jess): under 100 pounds 😮 is that somewhat normal for u? your usually like 110 right?
Nokri (Marisa): Ye I don’t think I’ve weighed this little since high school
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe I’m dying <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh noes
Aldus Larian (Jess): NOOO
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybe you just eating less total?
Nokri (Marisa): I ate a ton at the con though y’all saw my Pringles and that crepe I ate in one sitting. Crazy.
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe I sweat it all out. Gross.
Aldus Larian (Jess): leaking
Bill: sounds like you need food.
Nokri (Marisa): OR maybe the last few weeks I was getting lighter and my clothes were getting heavier due to paint and fabric/thread clinging to it so it evened out and then when I finally cleaned everything up my clothes got lighter
Aldus Larian (Jess): do you feel hungry?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~do you have an appetite?~~
Nokri (Marisa): Not really. I ate half a chocolate cake yesterday and made that soup
Bill: I *almost* thought you were going to but no instead of nou.
Bill: Also *I* don't need food.
Aldus Larian (Jess): soup
Aldus Larian (Jess): soup is good
Bill: So you are eating tho. I'm assuming the cake was pretty large.
Nokri (Marisa): ya it was a 13x9 pan
Nokri (Marisa): i bet i'm dying
Bill: NO
Nokri (Marisa): probably due to global warming
Aldus Larian (Jess): did u just get off your period about a week ago? sometimes that causes me to run at a lower weight for like a week before the bloating starts again
Nokri (Marisa): ooo that's interesting :0
no though rip
Nokri (Marisa): i've always wondered how much weight fluctuation that causes to people though <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): for me is like 6-8 pounds sometimes?
Aldus Larian (Jess): good times
Nokri (Marisa): wow girls suck. that's a lot of blood and mucus.
Nokri (Marisa): and other stuff.
Nokri (Marisa): rocks are so cool, who likes rocks? do you guys like rocks?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think its more like water retention but ya

Bill: ~~I actually wanna send you a set of them cause the worry stone on my fidget cube and now these have been really helpful with the anxiety I've been feeling recently, I know it won't do too much but if it could help even a little I wanna.~~

~~Would you get mad at me, they're not expensive I promise~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): LAPIZ

Nokri (Marisa): bojo put them all out of order when she moved the bookcases so every day i die a little, being unable to fix them properly because of the furniture in front of the shelves
Bill: I cry too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): What do you organize by
Nokri (Marisa): depends on the language
english by title alphabetically
japanese by publisher and author
other languages are just kind of. there. i don't have enough of them to organize them much aside from by language
