Bill: I‚Äôve been trying to get into bullet journaling recently and some of the pages people post look amazing but. I can‚Äôt help think it took them the whole week the page represents to make the page/they‚Äôd be able to do the tasks in the time it takes to decorate the list of tasks.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I tried and it got to be such a chore to decorate it lol but some people are really artsy and creative and use it as a way to express that which is probably one of their goals for bullet journalling
Bill: I've got a much more productivity focus going on for now üòÖ
Bill: I've never found paging through notes app on my phone/evernote like software as useful for sporadic notes though, so it's nice to do.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I used it mainly as a to-do list and calendar but then I just started making my to-do lists on scrap paper and using my phone calendar more
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was using it as a sketch book for a while, but then I didn't like making decent sketches on dotted paper lol
Bill: Yeee phone calendars are better cause you always have your phone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was at a light I could take a right on red at but instead I just completely zonned out listening to music for 30 seconds. But no one honked at me! So that's cool

Aldus Larian (Jess): The one getting off fifteen
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Oh yeeee
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just sat there are the light like üò¥
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm trying a new method for posting. Saw another cosplayer do this where they post the full pic in the first photo, and then they do a closeup, splitting it between 2-3 additional photos, but so that when you swipe, it looks like one seamless image
Bill: 
Bill: > immediately goes out on deck to see if I can spot it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok, I really like doing the close up thing with a wide shot, so I'm recommending this app (or similar for iOS)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I've been getting a lot of God of Tee emails lately because I bought one (1) shirt from them four years ago and I'm finally looking at some of the designs

Bill: So.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I can get an updated version of the one I bought last time
Bill: I had an idea for a Claude Lysithea fic on the drive home yesterday. `Claude and Hilda watch Lysithea roast a guy` was the phrase to remember it. So, I turned on siri and had siri make a reminder.

What Siri heard is QUITE different:

`At a dildo wash Lisythea Rooster Guy`
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lmao
Bill: of all the names to get right though, even with a type, Lysithea?

Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs the reason it‚Äôs not a real desert
Fake desert
Take it back
Nokri (Marisa): BoJo is always complaining about Sylvia but I think she left with a very high newfound respect after guarding calogero for a little bit. He constantly tried to trip her and shouted at everything and tried to steal her food. At least he‚Äôs easy to watch because you know if it‚Äôs quiet he‚Äôs up to some thing nefarious
Aldus Larian (Jess): Slyvia demands respec
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Yeahh some animals are oof
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Little babes
Nokri (Marisa): Little mad lads
Nokri (Marisa): He tries to chew cables plugged into the socket and I‚Äôm like nOO

Nokri (Marisa): He fell asleep last night trying to destroy my computer charger you guys wanna see
Nokri (Marisa): too bad I‚Äôm spamming anyway throw me in internet jail
Nokri (Marisa): He‚Äôs awake now though
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMGGG hes cute but looks like a handful, is your arm ok?
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!! I‚Äôve put up with 13 years of Sylvia doing the same thing when she was younger, I am immune.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): NOM
Nokri (Marisa): My sister calls me the cat whisperer which is why she has me take care of all her cats <:rise:582318089228648456> 
She used to have 6 just like Calogero but half of them were deaf so you couldn‚Äôt even coax them down from the ceiling if they got up there
Nokri (Marisa): The most she had at one point was... 8 I think? 8 cats and two dogs I‚Äôd have to watch. That‚Äôs probably why Arabella (her current dog) likes me despite me being a lazy potato, I had to bottle feed her while my sister was at work because she was such a tiny puppy at the time, she couldn‚Äôt even open her eyes when they first got her
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hope theres some bread left when the instructor get done eating
Aldus Larian (Jess): pupper!
Nokri (Marisa): Fight the instructor for the bread

Nokri (Marisa): Become the instructor
Nokri (Marisa): Bang free bread
Aldus Larian (Jess): aw shit
Nokri (Marisa): one of my sisters best dogs was Fancy Killer Pants. he could do the best army crawl. He was a good boy.
Bill: Got my (under 40 pound) printers and camera stuff back on the shelves (putting in the desk just didn't appeal/work). Opened up the one from college to check the ink? Had a resume writing guide I scanned in senior year in it.
Bill: Damn.
