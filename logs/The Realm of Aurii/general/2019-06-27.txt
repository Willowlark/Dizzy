Andrew: Sooooo at work a minor cashier threatened to shoot a customer
Andrew: Yeaaaaa
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh
Andrew: I love the tandem response XD
Andrew: Dont know how exactly it started but the cashier and customer got really heated and  the dialogue culminated in a threat to shoot the guy.
Andrew: The manager had to restraint he guy as he went after the cashier who was being pulled away.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh god <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Andrew: The customer was takeen outside and cooled down, and for some reason the manager let him back in the store (still trying to figure out why he thought that would be a good idea,) he for some reason grapped his toddler son and walked back inside.
Andrew: And supposedly tried to say sorry as he went straight to the cashier but they got heated again and got a hairs breath away from getting violent.
Andrew: The cops were called and the cashier was sent home, thank god it didnt escalate.
Andrew: I hate this store.
Andrew: Our one manager is a bully who conspired to get my coworker kicked out (and is being accused of sexual harassment,) and the other is a rreally nice guy but has mentally checked out of caring about the store (he asked for a transfer.) The stoore director is nice but a pushover so nothing gets corrected.
