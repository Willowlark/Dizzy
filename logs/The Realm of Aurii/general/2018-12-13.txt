秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): my last class is tonight and I have to figure out if the bank will let me withdraw $500 at once so I can go in early and pay my tuition because it's overdue because they didn't tell me I owed anything, and because none of my cards are working at all to pay it online
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): omg so there's this thing in japan where concert tickets are sold on a lottery basis (like "congrats! you win the chance to buy a $300 ticket!!")
and someone was telling me last week that people who aren't able to get a ticket will go to the venue early and sit outside in hopes of hearing the concert through the walls. this was evidenced by the arashi fans who were at TDC at 9am when the concert was at like 7pm. 

so there was some kind of new hypnosis mic reveal last night i guess? and this is what it looked like outside the venue, where there was a screen that showed people outside what was happening inside

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG wow that's insane
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm seeing video that makes it look like it was an announcement result event. i guess the "division rap battle" part of hypnosis mic's title is true and they're gradually eliminating groups. it was really really close, just a couple hundred votes apart out of tens of thousands.
but yeah don't mess with japanese events people go hardcore
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): BoJo is always telling people "oh japanese people are so polite and always line up and would never be rude or shove" and i'm like "bojo you've never been to a concert or anime event here"
paula went to a concert the other day and she's super tall and she said she nearly suffocated since smaller girls kept pushing her and trying to get closer to the stage by crushing her
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): yooooo this kimono tho
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): When you gotta be classy, but also represent
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that's it exactly. there are images of girls throwing up hang signs like gang members except the signs are for their favorite hyponosis mic group
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's amazing 😂
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh wow that sounds crazy
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): if anyone uses tampons heads up that kotex u sleek is being recalled in the US because it falls apart
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): for all u guys out there

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): wow so i'm leaving kyoto late on the night of the 24th and arriving back in akihabara at 4:30am on Christmas day. too bad nothing's open that early <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: I have one more day I need to take off.
Bill: I can't take monday, holiday party. I don't want to take next friday, because I have a doctors appointment and that'll kill half my day off.
Bill: Can't decide on tues/wed/thur cause they all weird days.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OH MARISA does japan get of on actual christmas day this year?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): naw everything is open on christmas. everything is decorated for christmas but it's not really a holiday. people eat lots of fried chicken and cake, but it's more akin to valentine's day than anything
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): ya those are all weird days
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do they get monday off? cuz my friend gave me a calendar from japan and it has something written on sunday and monday but not christmas
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm gonna update the quest before i go to bed tonight finally but i'll be MIA the 17th to the 25th
really?? i don't think so? let me check i haven't heard anything
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): oh snap the emperor's birthday
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): fudge that might mess up some of my plans thanks for pointing that out
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOOO glad a could help
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *GASP* quest! *nyoom*
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that's definitely a public holiday. smaller shops and official government buildings like post offices will be closed on the actual day (23rd), while museums and bigger stores will stay open but close the next day (24th).

that way people who work for the government and people who work in stores can all get a day off yet still enjoy doing things on their day off
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i was trying to make a character page for quest but couldn't find a good enough doll maker
Bill: mood.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OOO ok yea i had no idea what it said i thought it had something to do with christmas
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): naw yeah, emperor akihito was born december 23rd :3
Bill: What do with day off.
Bill: Or do I try and get them to count it towards next year.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): that might be helpful
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): use it for NYE, unless your allready off that day
Bill: I have 24-21st off.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well then
Bill: then the 1st for the holiday.
Bill: It feels dumb to just take the day next week and fuck around doing nothing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): check company policy. some companies let you hold them till march, some will pay you out on the day, some companies (like min whoo) if you dont use it you lose it
Bill: I'm pretty sure I lose them (over 5 days remaining).
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thursday before Christmas?
Bill: that's what I was thinking, but tbh everything's going to be pretty much shutdown by then. Nobody will really be working, so why waste the vacation day.
Bill: Samething too, what do I *do* with the day.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well if you gotta use it then use it
Bill: Georgia is the only one on a non 9-5 schedule, but she's got finals.
Bill: So I'm doing something myself, but what.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lol idk ~~if i have a day off alone i ussually use it to clean rip~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): everything closes at like 5pm so i'm trying to find restaurants that are still open that i can go to at night for dinner. luckily the inn is near a 7/11 and a supermarket, and i just realized i'm gonna have a hard time with accents hmMMm.
oo there's an english friendly ramen shop nearby
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): climb a mountain on your day off
Bill: I *WOULD* do that, but I just used a day for that XP
Bill: Though I suppose I still have a lot to clean up.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): wow which mountain <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea, i mean i have awhole house so i basically never run out of work
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): marisa do you have someone to hang out with on christmas?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i have a doll of simba from the lion king and a ceramic boar statue

i can send pictures of a deserted akihabara
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oo neato
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): at least kyoto and hiroshima are cities with convenience stores. when i went to mt fuji i had to walk 2 miles to get to a supermarket for dinner. i packed a ton of food with me but it was mostly breads for emergency. the hotel had bikes we could use for free but the roads are very thin and i'm unsteady on a bike so i didn't want to risk riding it and crashing
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): and then two miles back to eat the food lol
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): i'm considering going to sensouji for new year's because that's very close by but it's also the #1 spot in the entire country
Bill: I went with rollover.
Bill: So I'll have 21 days in 2019.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): such a short year
Bill: I need today to be *not* busy k thanks, I have more shit to pickup in my room.
Bill: flying fuck this thing is big.
Bill: I somehow have more room for posters. It's around the slanted ceiling, so placement is a bitch.
Bill: But once I figure that out, yeet.
