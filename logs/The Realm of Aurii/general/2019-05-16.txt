Nokri (Marisa): I got a hacksaw how nostalgic
Nokri (Marisa): Why would I need sunlight there‚Äôs light in some parts of the house
Bill: it's supposed to be healthy for you
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It does smell fresh!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~thats pollen~~

Aldus Larian (Jess): Aaahhhhh

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think I‚Äôm still getting situated at home and taking time to make repairs to Pyrrha for shooting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tho I wanna see pikachu, next week is better for me
Bill: I kinda figured the local crew but if you wanna come out this way.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have plans tomorrow night
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg I showered and did my nails and put make up on
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I‚Äôm a human again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No longer a school gremlin

Bill: I need a douchebag jar like Schmitt man.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wut selfies
Bill: Snapchat filters.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ya no make up
Nokri (Marisa): Filters make people look awesome without makeup they‚Äôre truly great technology
Bill: I wasn‚Äôt chalking it to the filters, but it was a look.
Nokri (Marisa): Dude Georgia was a good look ya
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I wouldn‚Äôt have dated male Georgia LOL
Bill: ü§¶
Bill: Someone get a better emoji for that.
Bill: Kyon from Haruhi.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Male georgia looked more beefcake than tree boi
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Male georgia would be SWOL üí™
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~and that doesn‚Äôt even take into account that I probably wouldn‚Äôt date my own personality ahaaa~~
Nokri (Marisa): He‚Äôd be the guy people would go to if they wanted to chuck a rocket into space. He could just toss it through the atmosphere at 17k mph
Bill: In not this news.
Bill: Timberlands sorted out. Going to order them so I don‚Äôt have to carry them around the city.
Nokri (Marisa): I heard that male Georgia is shredded. That male Georgia has an 8 pack
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Male georgia would be a cool ass male Pyrrha
Nokri (Marisa): If I were a dude I would absolute hate myself though so I can see why you wouldn‚Äôt date dudeorgia <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): Now we have to keep an eye out at cons for our genderbent dopplegangers tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): I just look like my brother sooo....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or maybe male Georgia would be a Jaune because genderbends don‚Äôt get as much love
Nokri (Marisa): The ultimate Tru Bro‚Ñ¢ alignment could be obtained
Nokri (Marisa): I could see that. Jaune and Pyrrha have really different personalities though so if your personality was the same maybe you‚Äôd cosplay someone from SSSN or Ren or such
Nokri (Marisa): Probably not Ren. But Roman possibly? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): *mercury*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Neptune?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dead Pyrrha jokes translate to Neptune water jokes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Whoever is the male fan favorite lol
Nokri (Marisa): I was looking up popular rwby characters and found this which has nothing to do with the convo but it‚Äôs compelling me to share
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Fear
Bill: That filter was nothing but uncomfortable.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I thought it was cool
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs what I could‚Äôve been whoaaaaa
Nokri (Marisa): It made all the guys good looking and all the girls into chads
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Though I think I‚Äôd be more twinky
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like I‚Äôd look like Ryan without the abs or fabulousness
Nokri (Marisa): I think you‚Äôre on to something there
Nokri (Marisa): If I was a dude would I have long or short hair <:thinku:543194478614413318> id probably have a military style buzz
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What does bangs translate to on bois
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo this is a good possibility
Nokri (Marisa): Alternating between buzz cut and growing it out to that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YE DAT MALERISA HAIR
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What male georgia
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Probably typical white boi hair
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _with the gel_
Nokri (Marisa): <:minathink:544567715931750405>

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh like will, whitefangcosplay, his hair üëå
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GREASER GEORGIA
Nokri (Marisa): We can always tell when you‚Äôre near if we hear finger snapping and engine revving
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I agonized about what is the typical white boi haircut that male Georgia would have
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _found it, thank you captain America_
