Pawlitics: 
Pawlitics: wow what's this
Pawlitics: hi strangers
Bill: Not allowed.
Pawlitics: oh i'm not allowed here?
Pawlitics: guess i'll leave
Bill: I'm not joking around anymore.
Bill: You leaving is not a joke worthy topic in my book.
Pawlitics: my free will was taken away
Bill: Joke's over.
Pawlitics: i couldn't post images
Bill: However, you've just discovered a security failure in Discord.
Pawlitics: how can i post self indulgent invader zim fanart
Pawlitics: if i can't post pics
Bill: User specific permissions on a channel, such as preventing image embeds, are deleted when that user leaves the channel.
Pawlitics: yeah i left because i couldn't post
Aldus Larian (Jess): She obviously didn't think the joke was funny. Taking away her privledges is an abuse of power
Pawlitics: it's pretty obvious discord would delete the permission when i left
Bill: It would make far more sense to keep it there. On a server with open invite links, someone whose being a shit could have the permissions removed and rejoin easily.
Pawlitics: then that person should be banned
Aldus Larian (Jess): Can we make a new rule not to delete other peoples posts from now on?
Pawlitics: ye if i'm not allowed to delete my own posts can other people not delete mine
Bill: I only delete no u, so. No u is unbanned then.
Bill: Fine.
Pawlitics: 🎊 a great day for democracy 🎊
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cuz it's really not fair and I don't think you'd appreciate it if someone did that to you
Pawlitics: the original post wasn't even self depreciating
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what was the original post? was it the "no u" Uno card?
Pawlitics: yeah, i saw jess had posted it on tumblr so it was something along the lines of "thanks jess for this great image"
Tikur (Kurtis): Quality song for y'all https://open.spotify.com/track/4ICV8cfYzmaLHnUx02QxL7?si=CF9rrv83SK2la57HCrXRJg

Aldus Larian (Jess): I didn't get a chance to open it yet
