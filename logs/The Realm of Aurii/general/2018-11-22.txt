No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): me and the representative dude stood around for an hour talking about anime and cosplay (it got awkward when the convo died down so i showed him some katsucon videos because there was nothing to do but that probably made it more awkward eyy) and then I noticed the awesome water heater dude had a gundam themed phone screen (both lock and home owo )
water guy was really chill i liked him. he has to go to mt fuji now.
representative dude was also cool. ooh but he has to be someone else at 12:30 and it's noon now so that's probably why he started getting quiet and antsy.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nooo was really little when I happened 😮 yay for warm water and nerdy water dudes
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): he had to keep climbing in and out of my window which was tough, he was like "i'm 50 i'm not that spry" and me and rep dude were like ? ???? but you look so young>???

No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "i'm american it's ok you can wear your shoes i'll vacuum the floor."
and then old dirty water dripped on the floor and they gasped like it was the end of the world and i was like "lol it's ok here's a towel"
No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): AND AGAIN like 3/4 into the conversation dude says he was an english teacher at a high school before switching jobs. mentally i'm like *why have we been communicating in japanese all this time* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
