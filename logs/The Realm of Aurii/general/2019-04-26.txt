N🆗ri (Marisa): Do you think Lisa Frank is a furry
Aldus Larian (Jess): Probably!
N🆗ri (Marisa): I apparently lost two pounds in the shower. Was I that dirty from sleeping and sewing. Wow.
N🆗ri (Marisa): All those thread snippings build up. Make armor from snipped thread.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is normal clothing thread armor
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I Hope so
N🆗ri (Marisa): people in japan are going crazy about the new era
my friends are posting stuff like "*last class of the era*" and "*last visit to a cafe of the era*"
things'll still be the same in the next era y'all
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _last poop of the era_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Weather says it’s 55 degrees but it feels like 75 oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): THEY WILL POST THAT PROBABLY
Aldus Larian (Jess): aw shit new era is in one hour? 2?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 4 days <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what defines an era?
N🆗ri (Marisa): people are making jokes that if you were born in Shouwa and not married in Heisei, but get married in Reiwa you'll be doing a "heisei jump" but dont worry because there's still 4 days to get married
N🆗ri (Marisa): new era means new emperor, for the last couple hundred years the era name changes with each emperor
N🆗ri (Marisa): it used to stay the same for a while despite emperors changing, or sometimes emperors would change the era if something really bad happened like a big earthquake, but now it's just one emperor = one era
N🆗ri (Marisa): and for the first time ever the current emperor is willingly stepping down from the throne
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo why he step down?
N🆗ri (Marisa): he old (85) 👴 and having some health complications i think?
and the crown prince is getting old, he's almost 60
so they don't want to create a loop where emperors are too old to lead properly when they ascend to the throne (even though they don't really lead anything politically), and reign for a short period of time
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo yea thats what i figures
N🆗ri (Marisa): like the shouwa emperor reigned for 63 years
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is the 30th year for the current emperor
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg thunder scary
N🆗ri (Marisa): it'll make things  a bit wonky because most paperwork uses the era year instead of gregorian years
like, my residence cards had expiration dates that said "Heisei 32" instead of "2021" or such. bill payments and insurance payments were labelled "due by the 3rd  month of Heisei 29" instead of "due July 2018" or somethin
so people gotta convert those Heisei years that won't happen into Reiwa years
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh damn
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats gotta be a lil bit of a pain
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeee. i can imagine a ton of people being like "what do you mean my drivers license is expired? it expires heisei 34"
"it's reiwa 5."
"right! not yet heisei 34!"
N🆗ri (Marisa): good idea to change on an even year though. 34=4? that's easy to keep track of
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): BIG THUNDER
Elfriede Faun (Tom): B O O M
Bill: 
Bill: 😏
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea you guys are under tornado warning I think?
N🆗ri (Marisa): YUP I’m worried to death about Sylvia
N🆗ri (Marisa): We have one student lol this won’t cover my fabric costs
N🆗ri (Marisa): That means I can sew on the machine that goes NYOOOOM
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa strong boi
Andrew: It raining very hard
N🆗ri (Marisa): 29 yards of fabric for $50 <:pwease:555585508819075112> they are merciful salesmen
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have enough for Raphtalia, Kagura, Liar Princess, and a few side projects now
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's amazing
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeeee they’re very generous and it keeps me alive <:pew:543202259085950996> 
I just had to endure 20 minutes of “why aren’t the boys all over you” while they measured and cut it while I stood there like <:hmm:543194383885926403> “I have a cat”
