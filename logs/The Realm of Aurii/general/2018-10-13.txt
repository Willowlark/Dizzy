Afina (Georgia): Ehhhh
Bill: 😅
Bill: Cheers to the week being over.
Bill: Someone inspire me to finish the last dozen photos from Chestnut hill.
Elfriede (Tom): Something something Hunter will something
Bill: ugu
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): No one here knows how to bathe lol. We’re all foreign (mostly Chinese and Malay I think?). Someone just stuck their head into the room like “is it ok if I come in to shower?”
No. No you can’t enter the bath thats nearly empty and has room for like 8 people.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Interesting tidbit about Japanese hotels. Most you pay for your stay in full upon arrival in cash. Also they charge per person in the room usually and not per room.
Andrew: interesting
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Yeah. What if someone trashes the room? What if I steal the towel. They can’t charge me. This one didn’t even check my credentials they were just like “are you Marisa? Ok pay up here’s your key.”
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): $180 for two nights in a room with a bed on the floor, shared bathrooms, a public bath, and a pillow made of buckwheat husks. The lap of luxury. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
~~the view is super sweet though. Extremely foggy however. Sad.~~
Bill: That not super expensive.
Bill: Have you tried the whole public bathhouse shtick much?
Bill: It’s classic “anime things” but... not something I think most Americans want to dive into.
Andrew: im up so early i dont know what to do
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): It’s the second time I’ve done it, first time I was with people I knew who were also clueless so if we messed up we did it together. This time is just yolo. 
Yeh Andru what up with u bein up so early
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Make some pancakes
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Bruh onsen make your skin so nice. So nice.
Andrew: I just went to bed early last night
Andrew: And i already did
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): The pancakes will continue until morale improves
Bill: Yeeee I wonder how many foreigners take to it.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): [to biru] vote in my insta story you coward
[to georgia] not you sweetie you’re doing fine
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ALSO
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): 
Andrew: ha
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Public baths aren’t *bad,* foreigners just get anxiety on how to act. Like the girl who asked to come in. You don’t need to ask. I just entered and probably made stuff awkward for the girl who was already in there but hey it’s public. If it’s all Japanese who are used to it then it’s fine. I’d probably prefer a big group of people in there already because then it’s not incredibly awkward.
Bill: Oh tru if it was just one dude washing himself I’d be like “uh”.
Bill: “Am I supposed to talk to you? I can’t wear headphones in here”
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Not even washing, just sitting silently in a tub. YEAH I wasn’t sure what language she spoke so rip
Bill: Oof being one of 2-3 people in a room is awkward enough without being naked.
Afina (Georgia): Nakey makes it BETTER
Bill: *How*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Moreso when you dunno how to communicate with people. Do they speak Japanese? English? Ehh who knows. 
People generally speak to me in English because obvious westerner but Chinese? Thai? Malay? I dunno what you talk pls help. Even westerns don’t speak English half the time it’s more like French or Portuguese.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Or German. Lots of German kids for some reason.
Afina (Georgia): French really?
Afina (Georgia): Didn’t think japan had a lot of French tourists
Andrew: oh those germans
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Ye it’s pretty common. Enough that the most touristy of attractions have French guides. (And 6 or so other languages)
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): I can’t find the German flag on discord
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Help
Andrew: lol
Andrew: dont ask me
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): But you’re the German queen
Young and sweet
Only 17
Bill: PFFT
Andrew: 🇩🇪
Andrew: it is here
Andrew: im gonna choose not to adress that
Bill: Own it German Queen.
Bill: > Malaysian person in room
> no one else
> Awkward eye contact
> have to make conversation 
> “uh....”
> “what even is your country?”
Afina (Georgia): 🇩🇪 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): What is your secret to that emoji
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): it’s under d isn’t it
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Drat
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): I DID IT
And remembered a really embarrassing runescape memory in the process
Andrew: oh what one
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Thank you all and thanks to the academy I couldn’t of 🇩🇪 without you
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Was it that type you tried to buy a gf for cash?
Andrew: did you give 1k for fire
Andrew: fire 1k
Andrew: 1mil for free armor trim
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Nah there were people speaking German and I opened a German phrase book on Wikipedia and said hi how are you to them (in German) and they were like “oh hey you speak German?” But German in German is deutsch so I thought they were asking if I spoke Dutch and I was like “nein. no. No” and ran away
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): The beauty of cross cultural communication
Afina (Georgia): I love language
Afina (Georgia): Confusion is great
Bill: Things that are surprisingly nice: Georgia back to green icon.
Afina (Georgia): Oof you and me both buddy
Afina (Georgia): I gotta schedule with my academic advisor about these grades tho damn
Bill: it's not that you *weren't* available, so it's kinda meaningless but... still nice.
Afina (Georgia): I mean I’m not fucked for passing, but I needed a 3.5 to make it through honors oof
Afina (Georgia): I mean
Afina (Georgia): I was pretty unavailable
Afina (Georgia): There’s like the guilt trip factor that people won’t message me cause they know I’m doing the study
Bill: ,... ~~I totally didn't fall for that guilt trip~~
Aldus (Jess): Ash wants to take me to the Korean spa/bathhouse but I'm afraid I won't be able to communicate with the attendants. Like litterally I'm more afraid if that than being naked 😂
Aldus (Jess): I just did message you cuz I knew you were busy! Respect the red dot
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): JESS SAME PROBLEM
Aldus (Jess): YEA and I'm bad with accents, I mean I've gotten better but sometimes I need to like sit and think for a min and figure out what they said but that's awkward
Elfriede (Tom): It's okay Marisa I fell for the classic free armour trimming.
Elfriede (Tom): QQ
Bill: So.
Bill: reorganizing my anime library.
Bill: currently it's one big folder, each series prefaced with `@` if it's a 720p+ file, `#` if it's lower quality than that, or some other symbol that once meant something to me.
Bill: Because the media server on the tv doesn't like big lists of files, the plan is to do letter sorting, so all the A titled series in one folder, etc.
Bill: and remove the symbols.
Elfriede (Tom): you mean you dont have folders just labeled: Big ol anime titties, green hair, and nier
Elfriede (Tom): the only 3 tags obv
Bill: ~~sounds like your folders~~
Bill: I'm trying to decide if I should put what format the files are in in the filename. Ie `Clannad (avi)`. It's mostly so I can tell which ones have shitty formats (9/10 non mkv files are less than 720p (like I'm ever going to bother replacing them with better quality))
Bill: I guess the second () kinda calls me on my shit.
Bill: I shouldn't bother.
Bill: ~~oops I hit enter so moot point~~
Bill: I love that this just sorted 300+ folders for me.
Bill: shoot, I should have made an index though. I'll need a new script for that.
Bill: The place katy mom and I get our haircuts at is a spa. Post Kalahari I realize that is of interest to me.
Bill: ~~twice the price of Kalahari tho~~
Bill: Holy shit, I just looked at the code I used to rename torrents (removed [Horriblesubs](x86)_lol_ in the file names)
Bill: It's *Garbage*
Bill: I wrote it years ago, but.
Bill: what was I *doing*.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): In like an hour I’ll see if I’ll be high enough to be above the clouds. But what if I’m in a cloud. Does it rain inside a cloud.
Elfriede (Tom): it does rain inside a cloud
Elfriede (Tom): i... think.
