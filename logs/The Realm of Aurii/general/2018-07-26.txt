Bill: All that jazz.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): "how do i measure my child" sounds so ominous
Nokri (Marisa): nokri looking all perplexed and whispering "how do i measure aldus", sounding really ominous but in truth it's for a medical checkup

Nokri (Marisa): an aside where nokri finds afina drugged and goes off on the guy like "you call *this* a safe drugging? what if she gets brain damage??" and starts lecturing on the proper way to drug without being harmful

Afina (Georgia🍀): ITS ALL NATURAL
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH WOW PINCESS WE HAVE THE SAME BLUE WHAT A COUNCIDENCE
Nokri (Marisa): Eye patches suck they’re nothing like the anime show them to be
Nokri (Marisa): The store didn’t even have pirate-style eyepatches with the string, just adhesive ones smh
Bill: Awww hell I don’t want to be awake.
SwolfSteins: ^ agreed.
Bill: I already pushed back to the 6:58 train to get another hour of sleep.
SwolfSteins: Oof. I always wake up at 6 to get ready for work.. 😭
Bill: It’s 5 for me if I’m going to New York (and take the train I’m supposed to), or 6 if I’m driving to upstate New York. But I do that twice and once a week respectively, the other two days I work from home and sleep later.
Bill: The days from home are pretty much the reason I’m still sane tho.
SwolfSteins: How long of a commute is it for you
Bill: 2 to 2 and a half hours, usually.
Nokri (Marisa): Hewwo good mowning uwu

Aldus (Jess): i guess not D:
Bill: So.
Bill: I'm amused that her boyfriend having a birthday party, on saturday, didn't make her think "oh, *I* have one of those too".
Aldus (Jess): well shes allready booked a tatoo appt. at the convention
Nokri (Marisa): wot
Bill: I get the reasoning. Just think it funny.
Aldus (Jess): tatoo convention
Nokri (Marisa): she's getting a OH not an anime convention
Aldus (Jess): she prob rsvp'd maybe before she got response on the appointment
Aldus (Jess): but then she got it confirmed and the spots are hard to get so i understand why she wouldnt wanna give it up
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just wish the people who couldn't go would mark it 😭
Aldus (Jess): you post a little "hey guys if you know you def can or def cant make it could you just mark it that way for me?"
Bill: I was chatting with Gord as I am want to do. The HR person (whose coming to this office permanently in two weeks) apparently told him he was intimidating. I laughed.
Bill: #insubordination
Bill: He also found it amusing.
Bill: Me laughing, not the intimidating thing.
Elfriede (Tom): Oo Ryan's going to Japan owo
Bill: He then said he wanted to start learning some of the data science stuff, so he knows what's going on as far the work goes. 
I said "Hopefully that happens". Skeptically. He agreed I should be skeptical.
Bill: Finally I had mentioned that drives longer than 2 and a half hours tend to end up with me getting too much into my own head (in regards to my trip to DE). He told me to let him know if I need to change my commute.
Bill: Have to say, guy is pretty priceless. HR girl better not ruin the loose atmosphere around here.
Bill: Then we talked about how it's hard to make real friends via work, and had to bring up Tom and Dave as the rare success story.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh man I'm shredding papers today, my hands are so dry from the paper handling
Bill: oh right fucking Snow is going to be around this weekend.
