Afina (Georgia🍀): I was gonna go to bed but justin showed up to give me pop tarts and left
Elfriede (Tom): WHAT
Elfriede (Tom): NICU BUT WHAT
Afina (Georgia🍀): He was like "I'm outside"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I went outside
Aldus (Jess): Send him here
Afina (Georgia🍀): And he rolled down the window and handed me chocolate pop tarts
Elfriede (Tom): Slides you poptarts, keep the change
Eliran (Halim): i can't sleep because i have to keep my cat locked in my room with me
Eliran (Halim): and she isn't used to being stuck in one room all night
Elfriede (Tom): WHAT IS JUATIN DOING DRIVING AT 1AM
Eliran (Halim): she keeps pawing at the door and meowing
Elfriede (Tom): Aww that's the worst 😩
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~what are you old people doing up at 1 am :V~~
Elfriede (Tom): Old people need less sleep <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): ~~my uterus is falling out~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh god
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's like when a tooth is loose
Afina (Georgia🍀): "Should I just rip it out and end it or try to put it back in"
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's Mac and cheese hour tom, heal your wife with some cheesy mac
Aldus (Jess): God I wish
Elfriede (Tom): Prob would work too
Aldus (Jess): Maybe if just put the pot on my tummy
Afina (Georgia🍀): Do you also do the thing where you massage the pressure points on your back?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Where your little back dimples are?
Afina (Georgia🍀): That helps me in short term
Aldus (Jess): Not usually 😂 I just put a heating pad on and take drugs and eventually I'll fall asleep
Afina (Georgia🍀): NICU
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah those techniques online are like "do relaxing yoga" and it's like really bitch?
Afina (Georgia🍀): _im bleeding and you want me to do lotus pose????_
Aldus (Jess): Yea lmao not at 1am
Aldus (Jess): Watah flowah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Watah flowah heals period true facts
Afina (Georgia🍀): ACTUALLY Ren could probably totally do that
Afina (Georgia🍀): H u h
Aldus (Jess): Nora has cramps and rwns like "come on Nora you just gotta do lotus pose"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then she's like NAH and he does the "whoosh you have no feelings" thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): How handy
Afina (Georgia🍀): New JNPR headcanon that Ren does that
Elfriede (Tom): How handy indeed
Aldus (Jess): But physical pain isn't an emotional
Elfriede (Tom): Anytime anyone is feeling emotional
Elfriede (Tom): Boom, touched and temporarily cured 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooo true at least it helps PMS
Afina (Georgia🍀): Jaune's being a ho? Boom no emotions
Afina (Georgia🍀): Pyrrhas upset pining after the ho? NO EMO
Aldus (Jess): BEING A HO 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nora's being Nora? Whoosh emotioNS YEETES
Aldus (Jess): then he sleep
Elfriede (Tom): Wait does that mean if Ren does the diddly with Nora she's emotionless🤔
Elfriede (Tom): Hmmm
Afina (Georgia🍀): Then he just becomes 🎵 the Ren 🎵
Elfriede (Tom): Prob needs to be focused
Aldus (Jess): Nah I don't think so
Afina (Georgia🍀): WHAAAT NO he has to go out of his way to activate it
Elfriede (Tom): A G H
Aldus (Jess): Like he needs to make it happen it's not like "whoa don't touch Ren or you'll turn emotionless"
Elfriede (Tom): HES THE R E N HES THE R E N
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's probably what JNPR thought when they first met him tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): Meaning jaune and Pyrrha
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like "idk is it safe to touch Ren or...?" "I don't know!"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then Nora's all over him and they're like ok it's safe
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina (Georgia🍀): This is why JNPR is so much more funny than RWBY g-dang
Afina (Georgia🍀): So much more potential for antics
Elfriede (Tom): Oh yeah 👌 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀):

Nokri (Marisa): [appears out of the crowd] "georgia and the rest sent me" [merges back into the crowd]
Nokri (Marisa): oyasumiiii
don't die jess, let noragami heal you
there's also a chapter of yona where she's being murdered by her period you can read the yona manga and relate to that
Bill: Speaking of being awake, me and Dad roll of the couch at 3am.
Nokri (Marisa): couch rolling contest
Nokri (Marisa): my friend wants me to come to her house tomorrow if my work is miraculously cancelled.
my work will only be cancelled if the trains are cancelled.
she lives an hour and a half away by train.
how do i get to her place if the trains aren't running <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Why wouldn't they be running? 😮
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao, Japan's trains... Not.running
Elfriede (Tom): Dohohohoho
Nokri (Marisa): we gettin' a typhoon yehaw
the big fireworks show was postponed and might be cancelled
Nokri (Marisa): trains will probably keep running aside from some delays
i'll likely have work but maybe my students won't show up that'd be nice ;u;
Nokri (Marisa): i am a little nervous to go to work because i don't wanna be blown away by the wind or hit by lightning ;u;
Elfriede (Tom): Wear really heavy shoes :3
Elfriede (Tom): ~~but yeah that sucks I'm sorry~~
Nokri (Marisa): *tom did you cause this typhoon*

Nokri (Marisa): no u
Aldus (Jess): <@!245270932602486784>  u need us to bring anything tomorrow?
Bill: ^
Afina (Georgia🍀): Uhhhhhh any alcohols you want and any games you think would be fun
Afina (Georgia🍀): Otherwise I'm gooood
Aldus (Jess): 👌
Bill: I assume air mattresses as well.
Bill: Or are most people not staying over.
Nokri (Marisa): AIR MATTRESS FIGHT
Like a pillow fight but BIGGER
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): BIRU
Nokri (Marisa): Now I have to call the cops on you
Bill: sorry to disappoint too, but Georgia doesn't do alcohol. I went out of the way to try and find something she liked awhile back, no dice.
Nokri (Marisa): Because she’s a child duh
Nokri (Marisa): A good bean
Aldus (Jess): ~~she drinks mikes hard~~
Bill: ~~is that alcohol~~
Nokri (Marisa): ~~it is I know because our shore house has a ton of merchandise from it because of a contest my family won~~
Bill: iirc it's not like she likes it enough to choose it over not alcohol.
Aldus (Jess): ~~its got 5% which i more than some beers~~
Nokri (Marisa): GEORGIA UR TOO SMOL FOR THIS
Bill: Marisa would actually be wasted on 2 ciders wouldn't she?
Aldus (Jess): i could get waster on 2 ciders with how little i eat sometimes <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): We’ll never know. Ever.
Is alcohol tolerance genetic though because if so probably not
Aldus (Jess): i had so much higher tolerance with 25 extra pounds
Bill: Most of it is acquired, even if there is a genetic component.
Nokri (Marisa): When card shopping I found a 3D police car birthday card but because it’s a bit big I couldn’t send it to Georgia without paying a ton of extra fees so I had to send another
Georgia did u ever get stuff in your PO box
Aldus (Jess): depends on how much you drink and how often, how much youve eaten
Nokri (Marisa): If alcohol didn’t exist we’d all have high tolerance
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Bill: literally the opposite.
Nokri (Marisa): Source?
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/thedadbreak/videos/390390821486156/?hc_ref=ARROiUk6YCBAgsmN2PYoFLEXrwfSsgjWvZoqyquKKpQnBZQe0w2CvdCOMc1gJ7gIAOc
Nokri (Marisa): I’m goin to bed but I expect an MLA essay at least 4K words by sunrise
Aldus (Jess): im cheating on my diet tonight and likely the rest of the weekend and i already feel guilty <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: 😢
Aldus (Jess): i feel like its so counter productive at this point cuz im so close to 125 but like staying on diet at parties is really hard and ive been eating nothing but salads and chicken wings at resturants and D: ~~also im on my period so treat myself?~~
Bill: TREAT YO SELF.
Aldus (Jess): maybe ill just try not to go too overboard
Bill: I was going to say something like 'a birthday party is once a year' but seems like we've got one every other week these days.
Bill: case in point, mine's in less than 2 weeks, heck.
Aldus (Jess): haha yeaaaaaa ~~might low key bring my own ice cream~~
