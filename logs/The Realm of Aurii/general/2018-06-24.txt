Nokri (Marisa): I know BNE has had some rocky stuff in the past but is it just me or does the chat there seem stiff/awkward/forced? ~~it could just be me reading too much into things~~
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao I had to double check,that sounded like something Billiam would say
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): Biru stop hacking my account
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: A little? With people who don't know each other as much
Nokri (Marisa): Ventriloquism
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It IS a little forced
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But it's just to have that avenue open for cosplay friends
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I barely talk to half of them
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah. The answers people give feel like generic “wow cool” answers. I get not wanting to reveal too much info to strangers but it seems like everyone’s got this fancy facade up when they could be memeing each their instead
Nokri (Marisa): ~~I’m gonna go in there and meme it up~~ that would destroy the server tho
Nokri (Marisa): Are people worried about their image
Are they trying to be cool enough for the cool club
Aldus (Jess): ~~aurii best server~~
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): Watch out, beef is pretty compelling too
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah there's def a lack of true memeing culture, not sure why
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: But ye Aurii best server
Bill: Stop impersonating me Marisa. (You’ll be miserable don’t be me)

We default here, I assume the others default their own groups. BNE is a mix of different circles. We have:

my circle of Georgia, Hal, Tom, Jess, Marisa, and myself;
PA squad which is Erik, Leanna, Jaime, Rebecca, Monica, Heather, Snow, Matt (formed based on proximity pretty much);
Delaware Squad is repped by Meg and Lissy, but they aren’t active;
Mark and Audrey are on their own for the age difference;
The rest are outliers with a link to someone in one of the core groups. 

PA squad formed because of BNE, so they’re the most core to the server activity.
Bill: Yes, I really enjoy observing social groups.
Bill: We have a weird mix of meaningless conversation and serious conversation (ie Snow) in the server. Only certain people bring serious to the server, namely PA squad as to them BNE is a core friend group. We bring our serious stuff here, and others don’t as they don’t feel it’s a place for it. So it’s also a mix of different comfort levels that makes for different interactions in BNE.
Bill: That said, I can add a meme channel if you want Marisa. I’d like to get BNE to a more even comfort level and meme life is good for that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Damn y'all Davids grad was lit
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Awesome! I'm glad!

Bill: where do your parents camp Jess?
Aldus (Jess): The great divide
Bill: why is that in andover what.
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Bill: They live in the woods ™ why not camp up there?
Aldus (Jess): The campgrounds in Montague suck 😂 it's close enough to go often, but far enough away to still feel like they've gone away
Bill: go figure.
Bill: makes sense though, gotta go far enough away for it to feel away.
Aldus (Jess): Yenthey also just really like that campground, they went there the first time with friends and then they were like "yes this is good campings"
Bill: mm... So far as going to meteor watch Andover has more light pollution though.
Aldus (Jess): *chants* Dark park dark park dark park
Bill: Though I don't get why the two recommend sites in the article are by me and not upper sussex.
Aldus (Jess): http://www.dcnr.pa.gov/StateParks/FindAPark/CherrySpringsStatePark/Pages/default.aspx
Aldus (Jess): Ohhh nvm I didn't read the article
Aldus (Jess): 😅
Bill: I mean, that looks good?
Aldus (Jess): Ye me and Tom have been meaning to go for a while
Bill: Jenny Jump is one they recommended, and it seems pretty good.
Aldus (Jess): That's close to you right?
Bill: Campground for 6 is 20 bucks, a Shelter (not a cabin, idk) is 48.
Aldus (Jess): Ye state parks are cheap af
Aldus (Jess): Note: no drinking on stste property
Bill: ~~it's just soda, ignore the bourbony smell~~
Bill: And jenny jump is straight west of me, I believe over the PA border.
Aldus (Jess): Nah it's in Hope NJ
Bill: I thought it was Hope PA, whoops.
Aldus (Jess): Tom and I saw a meteor shower at my parents house p.well like 2 yrs ago
Bill: I'd private campground too, just don't know any.
Aldus (Jess): We just laid on the deck
Eliran (Halim): we did drive through NYC for the drive back, but it was cause we dropped the Jesses, Allegra, and Lexloother cosplay off in brooklyn
Aldus (Jess): Neato!
Eliran (Halim): now
Eliran (Halim): back to aside 2 to finish this up
Bill: Tru, your parents are definitely in a low light area.
Aldus (Jess): Yea! My sister in laws family's property probably has less? Maybe. Not sure
Bill: I like this idea. It's weekend after my birthday too, if we can find the right spot that's two birds with one stone. Gets Mom off my back to do something for my 25th.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Y'all I has another weird dream
Afina (Georgia🍀): I dreamed that in order to get the best photos, the model has to cover themselves in butter
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I shit you not, I dreamed that bill showed up to con with a bunch of sticks of butter and we all just slathered that shit on
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Pfffffffft
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Bill: ah yes I have the best idea guys, I read it in a totally legit article
Bill: There are too many ways to snark this.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: You seem to have a alot of cosplay dreams lmao
Bill: I'm going to go with that's one hell of a kink Georgia.
Bill: I'm never going to be able to pass you butter normally ever again.
Bill: Paula Deen school of photography recommends: Butter.
Bill: Generic Beach Episode screenscreen applying scene: but with butter.
Aldus (Jess): I don't even wanna think about that sunburn
Bill: Could be worse.
Bill: It could have been mac and cheese she dreamed would help.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i put butter on my toast for breakfast
Afina (Georgia🍀): i cant look at it the same
Aldus (Jess): You done fucked up now
Afina (Georgia🍀): im looking what the internet says it means
Afina (Georgia🍀): Butter

To see or taste butter in your dream suggests that you are looking to be gratified in some area of your life.  You need to indulge yourself in life's pleasure. The dream may be a metaphor that you need to "butter" up to someone, in order to ease the situation.
Afina (Georgia🍀): my butter dream is telling me to treat myself
Bill: whose the guy who decides what *butter* means in dreams?
Bill: I want his job.
Bill: those are two different meanings though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean i was buttering up myself
Afina (Georgia🍀): we all buttered ourselves
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: we all need to TREAT OURSELVES
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: clearly
Bill: boi I do alot of that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): hmmm bill did PROVIDE the butter
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think the dream is telling us to do an escape room again :V
Bill: hows that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): because you see
Afina (Georgia🍀): you, billiam, brought us the buttr
Afina (Georgia🍀): you enabled us to love ourselves
Afina (Georgia🍀): much like you handle all the booking of the escape room
Afina (Georgia🍀): and then we assemble together to the escape room, much like we assembled in the con hotel room
Afina (Georgia🍀): and then we all treated ourselves, but escaping a room
Bill: Child, please do not try and associate me giving you butter to lather yourself in with booking escape rooms.
Bill: Just say you want to do an escape room.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _the butter dream told me to escape a room_
Bill: I scrolled past these comments and saw b!!! and read it as Bill which was weird, I didn't comment on the post.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao nice
Matty B: OMG HAPPY BIRTHYDAY KURTIS WITH A K 💙

Bill: Whoops. I didn’t mean to take a nap just now.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YO HAL AND I NAPPED TOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's like nap telekinesis
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *how cute*
Bill: I’d rather not.
Bill: Naps make me more tired. And get sleepy brain, which is never great.
Bill: Imma just wait out the sun shower in my driveway.
Bill: Fuck it.
