Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): !lewd
Bill: But not in the good way.
Bill: I wanna get some.... not black and blue shirts and lighten up the old wardrobe. But it foolish to do that at (hopefully) only part of the way with the weight loss thing.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): you could always thrift shop for some lighter colors
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not paying a lot, still updating your wardrobe while youre still working on your weight loss
Bill: Could, it‚Äôs an idea.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that pink shirt you got for Sakura Sunday looked really good on you
Bill: you flatterer you.
Bill: We'll find out when Marisa does the pictures of Me and Georgia she took.

Nokri (Marisa): give us good dreams darn it
Nokri (Marisa): What are we even paying for if they suck
Aldus Larian (Jess): request a refund
Nokri (Marisa): ‚ÄúRemake it but this time the protagonist gets mad that his sacrifice was only beneficial to the friend and his friend reneged on their promise making him a big neener‚Äù
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I won't up feeling axoous and disappointed at myself but idk why
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Amybe it was the 4 hrs.of.sleep
Nokri (Marisa): Could it be because Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto are in retrograde?
Nokri (Marisa): I‚Äôve just been commissioned to make ten fabric dragon tails <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOOO!
Nokri (Marisa): Why they need so many dragon tails tho <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): dragon army
Nokri (Marisa): I only accepted because I‚Äôve actually made a ton of dragon tails before whoops, and they‚Äôre family
The last big commission I helped with was for the lead singer in a famous band who needed a new cape before their Vegas show. That was incredibly nerve wracking. Their aunt is one of our students.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wooo hope that gets you some dollars <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): Nope, just the cost of fabric <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and you're not charging for labor because...?
Bill: *Marisa*
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs my sister in law and I don‚Äôt want them to hate me
Bill: *your time is valuable*
Nokri (Marisa): No it‚Äôs not
Bill: *make monies*
Nokri (Marisa): I try
Bill: Your time is valuable, rather than make those you could make your own new cosplays or pet Sylvia.
Nokri (Marisa): But also I‚Äôm awful :pet:
I‚Äôm trying to make a new cosplay but Sylvia is sitting on me right now
Bill: You are NOT
Bill: If you were awful they wouldn‚Äôt ask you.
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah I am I‚Äôm workin on Raphtalia :3c
Nokri (Marisa): They ask me because they know I‚Äôll do it for the cost of fabric and I live five minutes away
Bill: Then they‚Äôre using you?
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah probably
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's not right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): charge for labor
Nokri (Marisa): Well, definitely
But i already think they hate me and I don‚Äôt want them to hate me more
Nokri (Marisa): My sister is the family favorite
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): add $10 to each tail
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *at least*
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs so much!!!
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôd cost them $100
Bill: ,...
Nokri (Marisa): They covered my phone bill while in japan so it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm repaying them
Bill: You‚Äôre incredibly broke right now and they know it. It‚Äôs not right of them to use you.
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre paying the cost of fabric
Bill: You not making a profit on it is using you.
Nokri (Marisa): I profit in the bonds of friendship...?
Nokri (Marisa): Camaraderie...?
Nokri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: I‚Äôm not arguing this with you.
Bill: And that yay has put you in the penalty box.
Bill: No reacts.
Nokri (Marisa): Help my reacts are gone
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs 90% of the way I communicate

Aldus Larian (Jess): BIRU DO NOT TAKE AWAY MARISA REACTS
Aldus Larian (Jess): PLZ I NEED THEM
Nokri (Marisa): Is this a happy statement? A mortified statement? A sarcastic one? I guess we‚Äôll never ever know
Nokri (Marisa): Medulla oblongata
Bill: I love them too but I‚Äôm actually quite mad.
Bill: You have the ability to give them back to her Jess. It‚Äôs just a role just needs added.
Nokri (Marisa): Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll still react irl
Aldus Larian (Jess): i know
Aldus Larian (Jess): but i thought ud get mad
Nokri (Marisa): Can‚Äôt believe Biru put me in anti react jail
Nokri (Marisa): There‚Äôs moss in here
Nokri (Marisa): And so it begins, the new tide of a dark era
Nokri (Marisa): Guess who busted out of jail punks
Nokri (Marisa): MY APP CRASHED I ADDED TOO MANY EMOJI SO IT CRASHED AND FHEN WLULDNT LOAD I legit thought I was booted from Aurii lol
Nokri (Marisa): You can take the weeb out of the con but you can‚Äôt take the con out of the weeb
Bill: Wow this does annoy me.
Bill: Zen side eye face.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *tch*
Bill: Thank you.
Nokri (Marisa): Tch vs. Feh
What‚Äôs the difference
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~Yelling at someone for their depression symptoms and taking away thier freedoms won't fix anything~~
Nokri (Marisa): Beastars is such a good manga the characters are really realistic
Nokri (Marisa): Remember hyperbole and a half
They had some good stuff

Bill: I love you Marisa but I‚Äôm just frustrated.
Nokri (Marisa): It‚Äôs okay I‚Äôm emotionally dead inside and think nothing of it <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üòî
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): we care about you Marisa
Nokri (Marisa): Thanks but don‚Äôt do that
Try skeeball instead
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why not both
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa and skeeball
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *the perfect combo*
Nokri (Marisa): If I go skeeballing I will *mess all of you up I am a skeeball CHAMP*
Nokri (Marisa): We can pool our winning tickets together and get a Barbie doll
Nokri (Marisa): But like, a limited edition one you can only get through arcades

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yass
Nokri (Marisa): I stare into the abyss and the 1000 points sticker stares back into my soul

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow, okay Tellonym. Fuck you
Aldus Larian (Jess): That looks like a nightmare
Bill: It‚Äôs mostly Leanna.
Nokri (Marisa): Those are such vague notifications
Bill: They don‚Äôt show context until I unlock it.
Nokri (Marisa): Is that a setting? Mine just blasts exactly what the notification is at all times
Bill: Yeah it‚Äôs somewhere in the settings. It was default on this phone so I left it.
Bill: Facebook is scary, as soon as I finished avengers I start seeing posts about it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia):
