Nokri (Marisa): First time I’ve seen cosplayers advertising a regular store today. A Madoka and a Mash were standing around a Takoyaki shop holding plush octopi. 

And then I found this awesome store and the shopkeepers were all super friendly and they called me “onee-san” and I almost cried joyous tears of blood and then my stupid sarcasm ruined it when I joked that they were open on a Sunday after they said they’re closed on weekends (today is a big festival in kappabashi) and they didn’t recognize it as humor. 
But they still asked me to come back and teach them English so I count it as a social victory.
Elfriede (Tom): Omg that's great 👌 👌 👌 👌
