Nokri (Marisa): Oh also we all gotta play TATTERED WORLD
Nokri (Marisa): We went into a few museums on Sunday afternoon and again they kept pulling me to the side to search me with the fancy wand when most people just went through the metal detector. That combined with constant random searches at the airport proves that I am extremely threatening.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Omgg whyyyyyy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Threatening aura
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh wait didn't you say it's because they are supposed to check small girls
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Pokemon go says I walked 24 km. Rip I needed 25 for tier 2 rewards
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _back to the treadmill_
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t think they tend to check small girls? A bunch of other girls went through no problem, there was always a line. At airports they check if girls have spoons in their clothes but the metal detector would pick that up. I never set off the metal detector
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Huhhhhh
El🆓de Faun (Tom):
