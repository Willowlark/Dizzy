Nokri (Marisa): I keep having dreams about high school which is weird. But all the people are aged up. Last night I was in gym class and was leaving the locker room when I saw a girl who absolutely loved social media but disappeared off the face of the internet after graduation. (irl we think she joined a cult) In the dream she was covered in hardcore tattoos and really tall and said she was in chinese prison.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): Was she really tall irl?
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t quite recall <:thinku:543194478614413318> ~~everyone was taller than me~~ I think she was a little tall, but nowhere near like the dream. Maybe 5’5” or so in real life
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I resisted the **goods**
