NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i thought i had my headphones around my neck but they either fell or i put them somewhere and i can't find them <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Erik: Are they on your head?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): I THOUGHT SO but no i can't find them? i might go brush my hair to make sure but i don't feel them in my hair
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): a lot of stuff has gone missing and it's weird. like my switch and DS chargers.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i know the headphones are on but they're not within range of my computer
maybe i can walk around with my phone's bluetooth trying to pick them up ðŸ‘€
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *Walking around house* hewooooo
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): "hewwo? hewwo, headpwones??
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i walked around the whole house and my headphones aren't in range anywhere. which is weird because it's a tiny house and they can be picked up from nearly anywhere on the same floor.
other dimension took my headphones confirmed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hmmmmm
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hopefully they turn up
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): turn down for WHAT [jazzy music plays faintly from headphones in other dimension]
Bill: Finally got those new glasses.
Bill: They. kinda warpy and weird.
Bill: Gotta see if I get used to them.
Bill: Shame. There is definitely some kind of issue with the lens. Think the AR coating was scratched when it was applied.
Aldus Larian (Jess): my bosses saw something at a trade show that apparently looked like i designed it? and one of them asked if i was working somewhere else part time? like no? its called following trends and knowing what the rest of the market is doing
Aldus Larian (Jess): like the thing they saw was from the DOE, the fucking government, i wouldn't be here if i was working for the government
Bill: Can't imagine there's a lot of government graphic design gigs to begin with.
Aldus Larian (Jess): they prob out source
Elfriede Faun (Tom): LMAO omg
Aldus Larian (Jess): ugh
