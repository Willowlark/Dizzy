N🆗ri (Marisa): i thought i had my headphones around my neck but they either fell or i put them somewhere and i can't find them <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Erik: Are they on your head?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I THOUGHT SO but no i can't find them? i might go brush my hair to make sure but i don't feel them in my hair
N🆗ri (Marisa): a lot of stuff has gone missing and it's weird. like my switch and DS chargers.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know the headphones are on but they're not within range of my computer
maybe i can walk around with my phone's bluetooth trying to pick them up 👀
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *Walking around house* hewooooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): "hewwo? hewwo, headpwones??
N🆗ri (Marisa): i walked around the whole house and my headphones aren't in range anywhere. which is weird because it's a tiny house and they can be picked up from nearly anywhere on the same floor.
other dimension took my headphones confirmed
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hmmmmm
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hopefully they turn up
N🆗ri (Marisa): turn down for WHAT [jazzy music plays faintly from headphones in other dimension]
Bill: Finally got those new glasses.
Bill: They. kinda warpy and weird.
Bill: Gotta see if I get used to them.
Bill: Shame. There is definitely some kind of issue with the lens. Think the AR coating was scratched when it was applied.
Aldus Larian (Jess): my bosses saw something at a trade show that apparently looked like i designed it? and one of them asked if i was working somewhere else part time? like no? its called following trends and knowing what the rest of the market is doing
Aldus Larian (Jess): like the thing they saw was from the DOE, the fucking government, i wouldn't be here if i was working for the government
Bill: Can't imagine there's a lot of government graphic design gigs to begin with.
Aldus Larian (Jess): they prob out source
Elfriede Faun (Tom): LMAO omg
Aldus Larian (Jess): ugh
Bill: The new glasses be scratched up so while I’m waiting for the optician to look at them...
Bill: I need to get another pair before I get off my parents insurance in August.
Bill: My company doesn’t have vision right now iirc.
Aldus Larian (Jess): bottom
Erik: agree
Bill: I wouldn’t have said so at first but I’m inclined to agree.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm always thicc frame biased
Leanna: i like the thicc frame too
Erik: I'm partial to plastic frames
Erik: ~~I also find them more comfortable~~
Bill: Going to do. Mom pointed out they might start to look big as I thin out but. They look really good now and *yolo*.
Bill: ~~the insurance argument is crap cause I get glasses for cost at Mom’s office which is cheaper anyway~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): you could get them online too
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont even use my insurecne for glasses, its only $100 credit so i use it for contacts and get glasses online
Bill: Ye. I don’t wear contacts enough to warrant buying any yet.
Bill: Still have 3 boxes of samples.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: Should this weekend, actually.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoaa then only give me one pair of sample when i go
Bill: I mean. My Mom runs the office lol
Erik: I'm still on my first pair of non-sample lenses lol
Erik: which I think I opened in August for RTX
Erik: and have worn only a few times since
Bill: Also Erik we’re going on a bar crawl in Morristown Saturday. It’s a small town, basically a Main Street and that’s it but it’s 5 bars in the crawl and I booked a hotel two blocks down via points so we don’t have to drive after. You should come.
Erik: OwO this Saturday?
Bill: Ye. There’s a Facebook ad for the event.
Bill: I gotta get back from eye place, someone else linky.
Bill: I dunno whose going outside Kurto Leanna and me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.eventbrite.com/e/morristown-luck-of-the-irish-bar-crawl-tickets-55766190176?ref=eios&fbclid=IwAR0u3VGy6fn1htieio2OnIJpWyTwvozJFFuYoIEOJVMeCw9wFitZb9wokzM
Erik: is it the Morristown Luck of the Irish Bar Crawl
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea that
Erik: yup
Leanna: ~~also hunter invited me to go see HTTYD on sunday at 5pm in bridgewater if anyone is alive enough and wants to go~~
Erik: ~~*I see no one has marked that they're going nor interested so I'm assuming that's to prevent it from becoming a full blown BNE event*~~
Erik: but yeah that sounds fun and I'm not busy
Aldus Larian (Jess): time for anothe episode of "Jess finds weird stock images while trying to work"
Erik: Did you Google "white people aesthetic"?
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO lmao XD
Erik: also <@!184437198865563648> did you guys buy tickets yet?
Aldus Larian (Jess): kurto did, maybe leanna?
Leanna: ye
Bill: Me too.
Bill: ~~#~~
Bill: Also not marking interested was more “short notice, talk about it in chat” thing than *intentionally* avoiding BNE. Though it’s entirely true I’m happiest with a group no bigger than like, 8 people. All of BNE can get stressful.
Erik: gotcha
Erik: because that's all I need is for Rebecca to be like "OwO I want to go but I don't want to drive"
Leanna: ye ngl, i didnt mark interested to avoid others
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like smol groups
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill prob go? unsure if tom is coming
Leanna: i accidentally let it slip to hunter and was like "OH ITS SOld OUT SORRY, but i'll do a movie on sunday if you want"
Leanna: i love hunter but.... that boi is a LOT
Aldus Larian (Jess): opps
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i cant believe last year we went out for st. pattys and i was doing MM chatrooms drunk on my phone and this year its gonna be the same this~~
Leanna: ~~maybe i should actually try MM~~
Leanna: ~~ya'll seem to really like it~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~it addicting~~
Erik: It is. But it's also a lot
Erik: Make sure you're not doing anything exciting for the next week and a half
Leanna: oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): BIG MOOD
Leanna: maybe not
N🆗ri (Marisa): MM is the exciting thing you’ll be doing
Erik: like party day was Friday of Katsu and I was so busy I didn't get to actually do the party until that evening and even them I thin I skimmed through it
N🆗ri (Marisa): bUT PARTY
Erik: But like, I think I missed two chats because of my drive to Katsu lol
Bill: Hunter would make it a trip to be sure.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I missed 4 last night 😭
Erik: Sober Hunter is a lot in and of itself
Aldus Larian (Jess): he is v. excitable
Bill: *Yuppp*
N🆗ri (Marisa): what why
Aldus Larian (Jess): idk he has alot of energy
Erik: and a lot of volume
N🆗ri (Marisa): How did he come up tho in the conversation
Leanna: oh cause i accidentally mentioned i was doing a bar crawl with some of ya'll
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo cuz leanna almost accidently invited him do ~~totally not drink~~ with us
Leanna: and he was like
Leanna: 😮
Leanna: and i was like O_O
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh how did I miss all that
It went from glasses to mystic mess
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz your auto censoring blurred the illegal activity
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yes and now I’m calling the police
Aldus Larian (Jess): mawisa plz no ~~theres no mm in jail~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Uses your one phone call to make the 707 hide and seek phone call or the lullaby one
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone put a cop in the background
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats marisa
Leanna: I'll pour one out ~~into my mouth~~ for you georgia
Bill: ~~you can come, you just can't get the wristband~~
Bill: 4-9 is not late enough for bars to turn away minors.
Bill: Especially if we say you're a DD.
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is peer pressure Georgia they’re grooming you to become an alcoholic for life
Erik: maybe they'll be those bars that are like "Hey free sodas for DDs!"
Bill: ~~clearly I'm a much better human being drunk so~~
Bill: Hunter is excitable yes. And also considering I'm totally fronting the hotel room, Iiii'd turn him away on that.
Bill: ~~he did what, extascy thursday of katsu?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): AHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): What
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> that’s illegal
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~actual illegal drugs~~
Leanna: i have no idea what he even took
Leanna: but like 👀 🚔
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't feel bad that he isn't interested in being friends anymore
Erik: I'm pretty sure more than a weed
Bill: Anna and Mag were just saying how he was in a cvs somewhere begging for a ride.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Two weeds?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I believe it was weed and ecstasy oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): big ew
Erik: what a combo
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea ecstasy i think i know it wasnt just weed cuz i remeber being like "thats really illegal"
Bill: ~~booze is the only allowed drunk at my con rooms~~
Erik: good
Erik: my kind of room
Bill: Reasons I'm a shit, I should be using a real lighter to light the candle in my room, cause it's half used up and my fingers don't really fit in there. 

I'm a *shit* because insist on using quickchek matches or my bic lighter to light it, doing so in dangerous ways.
Aldus Larian (Jess): damn actually working is making my day both too long and too short
Erik: Guess I could use this time to actually flesh out my character...
Bill: I was about to say in the other channel don't let dat hype die down.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): No drugs in da room
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Not even Advil
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG ITS ONLY 2:09 someone shoot me
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That’s so lateee
Bill: mood.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): All I did today was go to class oof
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): At least that midterm felt easy
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It’s kinda weird, the material is just coming to me much easier this semester
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I think being sad actually hurt my ability to learn/remember things
