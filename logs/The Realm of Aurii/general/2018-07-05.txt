To disarm people and make them think she cute
Elfriede (Tom): uwu
Elfriede (Tom): 
Aldus (Jess): its too early for coworkers to be asking me stupid questions

except one girl whose cosplayed literally every version of yona and made her own
Elfriede (Tom): Oh wow nicu 👌
Aldus (Jess): i need to start getting into things when they come out and not years later
Bill: 
Bill: pretty sure Yona is pinching the tip of the arrow (no) and I'm not sure if you actually do need to clench the bow when shooting Bare Bow, but I'm pretty sure you don't like with recurve.
Aldus (Jess): marisa right now: "You come into my house, you insult my wife"
Nokri (Marisa): https://media1.tenor.com/images/81305fc212e74b704dd4af59e28e6227/tenor.gif?itemid=5666843
