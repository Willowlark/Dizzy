Andrew: A job im applying for is asking what Languages im fluent in, but im a little hesitant to use "fluent"
Bill: "proficient"
Bill: Also just list "obtained N5 certification in Japanese".
Bill: They can google it on their own time, but they'll probably assume you've got the chops.
Bill: Once your foot is in the door, they can decide based on you, not your resume.
Andrew: Im in an email correspondence right now, not sending a resume yet.
Andrew: Dont know if i should send in details until the i send the resume.
Andrew: Like, do i just say I have proficiancy in x and x or do i say that then add it in this email or wait until resume.
Bill: I'd just say you have the certificate.
Bill: "I passed the N5 certification exam in Japanese and something something German".
Andrew: lol never took an organized test for german
Andrew: I should do that
Andrew: pretty much for german its just 7 years of formal study.
Nokri (Marisa): do you still take german lessons or are you in contact with a teacher?
Andrew: No
Andrew: I mean not active contact
Nokri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274>
if you can contact a teacher you know, they can probably help
Nokri (Marisa): my old french teacher entered all of her students in a national french contest and that's how i got certified
Andrew: should i say n5 of the JLPT or just say n5 certification
Andrew: do i assume they know
Nokri (Marisa): assume they don't know, there are multiple japanese certifications that could apply to
Andrew: "I have proficiency in Japanese, with N5 certification on the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, and German."
Nokri (Marisa): i have to update my resume <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Andrew: oh god im always so nervous sending these
Andrew: She literally just asked me what i can speak and what kind of position im interested in
Andrew: And i still have a freak out lol
Nokri (Marisa): what are you applying for?
Andrew: A position with a translation company thats local
Nokri (Marisa): ooo have fun
Andrew: Theres actually a lot around here
Nokri (Marisa): ~~do you have one you could recommend~~
Andrew: ~~not really i just googled and emailed some i found that looked legit~~
Nokri (Marisa): i might become an ordained minister
Nokri (Marisa): just because
Nokri (Marisa): ~~because i have nothing to do with my life <:pew:543202259085950996> ~~
Nokri (Marisa): Are you gonna take the jplt this year
Nokri (Marisa): Remember how freaked out everyone would get before speech tests or before presenting in Sensei‚Äôs class
Sensei gets really freaked out when public speaking too
Bill: Oh Allison said that Sensei openly talks about how great you are in classes still Marisa.
Bill: Something along the lines of "All A+s would have to go to Marisa"
Nokri (Marisa): Lies she‚Äôs probably forgotten about me üòø
Bill: Bet you 50 bucks.
Bill: Straight up.
Andrew: Cant forget the legendary Biru san
Nokri (Marisa): I don‚Äôt have $50 but I have 50 bows
Bill: Sure, whatever, I'll take an IOU.
Bill: ~~I don't gamble because I have no luck whatsoever~~

~~this isn't gambling I KNOW she remembers you~~
Andrew: She definitely remembers you
Nokri (Marisa): 10 with little roses on the front, one totoro bow, one gamer bow, a cloud bow (those are nice they're my personal favorites), a star bow, and several candy/ice cream bows in the mix
Andrew: Especially since you guys kept contact?>
Nokri (Marisa): hmm, not really. last i saw her was before graduation when i thanked her for helping me get into the masters program
Nokri (Marisa): 2017
Nokri (Marisa): i think tiny kaicho was there lol she saw me scuffle into the room as her class ended and give her a bag of truffles and a bow
Bill: Go to her office hours.
Nokri (Marisa): she probably talks of daiva more, daiva was a great student
Nokri (Marisa): she's still in japan! that's how good daiva is
Bill: If she doesn't remember you I'll eat my hat.
Bill: Who *the fuck* is Daiva, doesn't matter.
Nokri (Marisa): daiva is great she's our kouhai
Andrew: Ohh i know Daiva
Andrew: kind of
Andrew: as in ive met her a couple of times
Nokri (Marisa): we had study sessions twice a week where we'd help the japanese 1's and 2's with their studying. yee she went to the jlpt sessions, she's currently teaching in yokohama
Nokri (Marisa): i had to carry her suitcase for a mile because she was flirting with her boyfriend omg she still owes me a karaoke session for that
Bill: Sounds mean.
Andrew: *people who are far more impressive than ill ever be*
Nokri (Marisa): no she's really nice. she studied at musashi the year after i did and then came to japan to visit her boyfriend and left her luggage at my house because she knew she'd be back in a few months so i went to the train station to deliver it because she couldn't find my apartment
Bill: Enough both of you. A resume doesn't measure your worth and value as a person, the kind of person you are does. I place my faith and trust in both of you because your incredible, special people more than worthy of my trust. JPLTs, study abroads, doesn't fucking matter. I would always choose you two over Daiva or someone with a N1, period the end. And you should take pride in that cause my trust is highly coveted. üòè üòÇ
Nokri (Marisa): andru is gold and pure and wonderful yeah!
Nokri (Marisa): >:0
Nokri (Marisa): u just delete praise for good boi
Bill: Because you're just trying to deflect praise from yourself, like you always do.
Nokri (Marisa): because i don't deserve it because i am trash wonder
Bill: I *just* said you are not.
Tikur (Kurtis): Hey <@301927856240459777> you're great no backsies
Nokri (Marisa): no u and andru!!
Nokri (Marisa): *why u gotta delete all the praise for andru what's he ever done to hurt u biru*
Tikur (Kurtis): Bill no abuse power
Bill: I'm just a terrible mean person.
Tikur (Kurtis): Bad child
Nokri (Marisa): i've seen too many lewd starfish images on the internet today
Nokri (Marisa): that's the universe whacking me with a rolled up newspaper
Tikur (Kurtis): Oh-oh no
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wish education didnt cost money üò≠
Nokri (Marisa): bernie pls burn our debts
Nokri (Marisa): <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Aldus Larian (Jess): even one course at community is $600 (prob more in reality) and i dont want to go for a degree i just want to learn stuff and better myseld for me

Aldus Larian (Jess): if you had told 16 yr old me that in 10 years id be like "wow i wanna go to school for fun" i would have thought you were cray
Nokri (Marisa): art classes would be hardest to find free online because of the submissions, writing also, but psych would be easy to find
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats what i was thinking
Aldus Larian (Jess): everyone in SCCC course guide is white
Nokri (Marisa): bojo wants me to go back to school to push the student loan payment dates back lol
she wants me to go for a doctorate but that takes years and i'd rather just do another masters in one year
Nokri (Marisa): *but that makes more debt*
Aldus Larian (Jess): üòÆ
Andrew: I could go back to school and get another bachelors in only one or two semesters i think
Andrew: but thats only a bachelors
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i was just looking at that for me too but im kinda done with trying to earn degrees
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~even though i only have an associates but like~~
Nokri (Marisa): i almost got three but i didn't want to go to the camden campus for the classes i'd need to take so i took on more minors instead rip
jess lets become ordained ministers
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh i know!
Andrew: Right before I graduated I talked to the modern lingusitics major head whicxh was brand new
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill hight mawisa to teach me art!
Andrew: To add it as a majopr i needed like 2 morew classes and a study aborad term

Aldus Larian (Jess): nice
Aldus Larian (Jess): art is hard
Aldus Larian (Jess): my major now has like 4 different options, when i  went we only had one option which was game design.
Andrew: I really should meet with the head of the major again about it.

Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Nokri (Marisa): since bill hasn't been around a lot recently i'm staging a coup and taking over this server
Nokri (Marisa): first law under this new rule is everyone has to read beastars without making furry jokes
Aldus Larian (Jess): can i finish yona instead?
Nokri (Marisa): all in opposition have to watch movies and shows in 140p resolution videos on youtube where the video keeps buffering constantly and the episodes are split into 5 minute chunks with part 3 missing half the time
Nokri (Marisa): maybe
Nokri (Marisa): that's like a prerequisite for the server, finishing yona
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's a sick form of torture
Nokri (Marisa): it‚Äôs very humanitarian you‚Äôll see. You‚Äôll all see.
Nokri (Marisa): Also on fridays you can‚Äôt use the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù at all
Nokri (Marisa): You‚Äôll have to find a way around using that letter so keep that in mind
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont like these rules
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): C@n we do this on Frid@ys?
Nokri (Marisa): No that‚Äôs obviously an ‚Äúa‚Äù
Nokri (Marisa): If you don‚Äôt like the rules get out of the kitchen
Tikur (Kurtis): Yes chef!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok/-\y then
Nokri (Marisa): You could‚Äôve used ‚Äúokie dokie‚Äù

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): dibs on GŒ±vin's nose
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I'm always the hat
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): There's a rabbit under there
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): The Monopoly game for NES taught me that
Nokri (Marisa): what's under the rabbit
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): The board
Tikur (Kurtis): Whatever the new Marisa regime gives me will suffice
Nokri (Marisa): you shall be

Nokri (Marisa): rare
Tikur (Kurtis): I love it üòç
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So Joey and I don't really have anything planned for Monday which is when we travel from Cincinnati to Nashville so after we check out from our hotel we're gonna go see Spider-Man in IMAX
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I can't believe I googled today: " Do bugs fly into the sun?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Do they?*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There were slim pickings for our showing of Spiderman, but I think we managed some decent seats
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Lmaooo
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): They don't!
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): They use the moon to judge thier tradgetory
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): At least the night insects do
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): So lights mess em up!
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Wow I can't believe that few of people are going to see Spiderman
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow that is a shocker
Nokri (Marisa): who's spiderman

Nokri (Marisa): also on a monday in the middle of the day after the movie's been out a while. people will probably buy their tickets in person
Bill: Your attempts at mutiny are noted and will not be forgotten. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): my sever now
Nokri (Marisa): we play fun games, like cooking muffins in the microwave in a metal muffin tin and seeing if anyone's blows up
Tikur (Kurtis): Ooh! I'm down for some 'splosions!
Andrew: Time for The Regime
Nokri (Marisa): Eating butterscotch cinnamon food while watching arin and dan trying to beat sans is paradise
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Megalovania plays for the 14th time
Nokri (Marisa): Oh I lost count which time this is but they‚Äôve been going at it for two hours and they‚Äôre still going strong. This is after they tried for two hours last week
Nokri (Marisa): They were afraid of being copyright striked for megalovania playing too much so they did a scat rendition of it about an hour ago
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Are they game grumps? I know nothing?
Nokri (Marisa): Ye!!
Nokri (Marisa): Ross and Barry played this when undertale first came out and it took them like 6 hours on a livestream to beat sans
Nokri (Marisa): They‚Äôre so close right now though they‚Äôve gotten to his last attack twice
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Damnnn
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): I have faith! They'll get it!
Nokri (Marisa): Arin‚Äôs getting really really angry and upset aaaa I think they‚Äôre ending it in 20 minutes too
Nokri (Marisa): I‚Äôm so worried they‚Äôre finally gonna get past everything but then die when he throws the heart around the box and causes unavoidable damage and get game over again
