Nokri (Marisa): This is poetry
Bill: There’s a pub near me, like between me and Sparta, called pub 512 or 517. According to the brauns there’s a young crowd after 10pm there Friday.
Bill: Maybe it’s worth checking out.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): go be social! 😄
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~and drink if you're feeling up to it~~
Bill: 517.
Bill: Another Friday.
Bill: I’m feeling no or very light drinking till Otakon. Just to take a break.
Bill: But yeah. And Recess has karaoke Friday now.
Bill: ~~def need to not come here every Friday cause I’m not in my 50s and I love these people but boy do I feel like a dope~~
Bill: 😬

Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea pub 517 is pretty popular never been there

Tikur (Kurtis): Y'all I got tater tots from Bagful I'm Bagels in Lafayette and I'm pretty sure they fried them in bacon grease cause I'm in heaven
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmaoo
Bill: Oop Jeremy isn’t coming to the game tonight.
Bill: Jen like “invite someone to chill with if you want” and I’m like “it’s 2 hours to the game people make plans girl”
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/events/388191075308732/?ti=icl if anyone was bored I guess.
Andrew: *vs South Jersey*
Andrew: guess i know my side #goteam
Bill: I know, they need a better name.
Bill: It’s my team too cause Jen lol
Bill: Feels like I’m going to Armonk oops.
Bill: Same direction.
Bill: Looool Jens team isn’t even here from the looks of it.
Bill: Awkward.
Bill: I’m also the only person here not wearing a shirt for the other team and I’m like yikes.
Bill: SUCKS it’s in an ice rink though.
Bill: Bad for photos.
Nokri (Marisa): how do you roller derby on ice skates
Nokri (Marisa): that sounds very danger
Bill: No ice on the floor.
Nokri (Marisa): that makes ice skating even harder
Bill: 
Bill: Jen come already so I don’t feel like an awkward person showing up to watch girls kill each other on skate XD
Bill: *the event says 5 why are they saying game time is 6*
Bill: Oh it does say doors open at 5 rather than game but.
Bill: You know about my compulsion to be earlyyyyy jennnnnn
Bill: I need to keep looking like I’m doing something on my phone and not avoiding communication so.
Bill: Play by play.
Bill: There’s a guy on skates and I don’t think roller derby is coed so I’m curious as to why. There’s someone in a ref shirt so he’s not ref, heck he wearing the home team shirt.
Nokri (Marisa): there are co-ed roller derby teams, or it could be he's the owner of the building, team manager, or has connections to someone on the home team. lots of other reasons
Bill: Oh good I was able to buy ticket and enter. Less awk.
Bill: I got a brochure thing, there’s guys on the roster for both teams so.
Bill: Must be coed.
Nokri (Marisa): join
Bill: No u
Bill: It’s a south jersey team lol
Bill: Or an upstate New York team.
Bill: Neither near me.
Bill: I found Jen!
Bill: The other team has a photog. Like, looks legit and stuff. Jens going to ask where I can go to shoot tho. Might be able to go on the floor. 💪🏻
Bill: See? Go join.
Bill: Cool I have all the move range of the (probably) pros and I’ve never done sports photography.
Bill: THE HEAT IS ON
Glonk: Those names
Bill: Other team just like it.
Bill: Is quality.
Tikur (Kurtis): Tag yourself I'm Middle Raged
Bill: Ngl I would not fuck with middle raged man.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Kill eesi omg
Bill: I thought you had to be burly to do this, apparently not.
Bill: Explains why Marisa was interested before.
Nokri (Marisa): easier to dodge and swerve
Nokri (Marisa): i'd assume
Nokri (Marisa): my sister was a good jammer
Bill: Yeeee I could see smaller good for jamming.
Bill: I now know what that means.
Bill: Correctly id’d the cosplayer Jen was going to set me up with (but she only likes Asians) as dirty orphan.
Bill: Cute girl on the other team too.
Bill: Middle rager can kill you. FYI.
Tikur (Kurtis): Good.
