Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Biru if you did bad on the evaluation be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just so worried for my friend. His mouth, it has a sore you see. Wisdom tooth removal. Tricky procedure. It‚Äôs been keeping me up and night and affecting my work.‚Äù
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Tom can you put a bandaid on it
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Hello kitty bandage
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Minion bandage
Bill: I did well. Everything meeting or above expectations and Gord‚Äôs happy with my work; and I aired my grievances about the way things have been running.
Bill: Now we‚Äôll see if anything changes.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Bring up tom anyway just for a chance to be unnecessarily dramatic
Bill: Don‚Äôt need tom for that.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): Great let‚Äôs do it
Bill: I‚Äôm not going to.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): A spotlight will really help
Oh do you have stage fright
Don‚Äôt worry with the spotlight you‚Äôll be too blind to see anyone
Bill: No, I did improv in college remember.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ~~in Japanese class
is that why you could turn the dialogues into such masterpieces~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): someone in another server mentioned they were going to visit japan and everytold told them to visit me, and then through unrelated means the conversation immediately turned to "we should reread homestuck."
so proud.

Elfriede (Tom): anime cat üëå
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): dabs into the server
hewwo nerds. just kidding you're all lovely people.
as y'all probably know i feel the server has been dying a slow and painful death recently, and those of us who are active are also in BNE so Aurii's role is slowly dwindling. ~~also where did ooc go. rip.~~

since the play by post is on hiatus, would anybody be interested in a choose-your-own-adventure style story to keep Aurii magical and going strong?
basically everyone would control one character (who would be created via a poll of different attributes). I would type up a scenario and then list several possible courses of action the character could take. people would vote on the course of action they should take via emoji reactions, or propose a different course of action if they wish, and the option with the most votes would determine what occurs next.

I figured it could be a lighter version of play by post because no post creation would be involved for those who are busy, just reading a post and voting on what to do next. but if there isn't any interest that's also cash money of y'all.
Bill: Reminds me of the Quests they do on 4chan and such.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ~~yes it will be done entirely in green text~~
Bill: Or tumblr. they do those on tumblr too, RWBY Quest was done on tumblr.
Bill: ~~Nightmare fuel that was rwby quest~~
Bill: http://therwbyquest.tumblr.com/tagged/rwbyquest%20update/chrono
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): THAT'S A HOMESTUCK
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): BIRU DID YOU READ A HOMESTUCK PARODY
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): *answer the question*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i can't believe biru read a fake homestuck but won't read the real deal
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): this is news of the year
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): maybe all of 4chan is also a homestuck parody
Bill: I did.
Bill: I'm in Mawisa.
Bill: And ditto, we have been leaning into BNE more recently.
Bill: With how cliquey BNE has been, I think I want to back out a bit.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): **i have one approval**
yehaw
is anyone else interested. no pressure.
Bill: *but pressure*
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I'm interested for sure, it's a relatively low dedication thing to pass the time with friends üëå
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): **two approval**
Aldus (Jess): Yea, that sounds like ti could be fun, very low pressure
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): omg the bus system in my neighborhood just got reworked so as long as i have time to spare i can use 3 different bus lines that cost $1 each to get around by just walking like 20 seconds down the street. i can get to akihabara for cheap and easy now, and it has a view unlike the metro. fabric streep, akihabara, sensouji, and ueno station are all within my $1 grasp now instead of having to walk or pay an exorbitant $2 for the metro 15 minutes away. beautiful.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): **three approval**
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i'll start making a poll after my shower instead of doing homework
Elfriede (Tom): That's awesome!
Bill: ~~where's the bus home~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): it's a new orange line since each bus route has its own color
~~tbh i thought that the new buses were just orange because it was halloween~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): lookit that. the big circle where red/green/orange meet is right outside my apartment.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): bus home is a duck boat that gives you the duck bill whistle that everyone detests
Bill: This looks like mini metro.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): this is tokyo's main metro
Bill: It makes me want to cry.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): for what reasons?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): in kawaguchiko there were 2 trains an hour. i couldn't believe it. in tokyo i get antsy when i miss my train and have to wait a whopping 5 minutes for the next one to show up.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): here the train map it's entirely different from the metro one
http://ontheworldmap.com/japan/city/tokyo/tokyo-train-map.jpg
Aldus (Jess): thats terrifying
Bill: it's complicated and hard to read.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ya it makes absolutely no sense unless you're used to it. basically the bigger the name of the station the more lines it has running through it.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): like Uguisudani only has the JR Yamanote and JR Keihin-Tohoku, but Tokyo has basically everything except certain subway lines (like hibiya aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oh and seibu-ikebukuro. that only runs to saitama out through nerima and ikebukuro. and probably seibu-shinjuku line. anything seibu probably.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): OH I FOUND THE OOC CHAT
Bill: lol
Bill: I suppose I should get to asking questions to figure out what changes need to be made.
Bill: OOC will be the place for it.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i'll post the character poll there in a while
Bill: Not in ooc.
Bill: ooc is for Aurii.
Bill: I'll make a channel for Mawisa-fest.
Bill: ~~I have no idea where to put it~~
Bill: ooc... should probably stay with the Aurii channels...
Bill: and then...
Bill: uh.
Bill: I‚Äôm going to the mall tonight; round 6:30 7 If anyone wants to meet up. Gotta return a flannel.
Aldus (Jess): gotta do the grocery shop tonight
Bill: *As the day goes on I feel more and more dead inside*
Bill: Ira is not helping.
Dave: Eat some ice cream, like I'm gonna do after work
Bill: I could get cliffs.
Bill: Still will be very dead tho.
Bill: FUCK I need it.
Bill: Throw blanket.
Bill: Georgia, probably.
Bill: They put in a go calendar in place of brook stone.
Bill: They gave a shelf of drinking/18+ games.
