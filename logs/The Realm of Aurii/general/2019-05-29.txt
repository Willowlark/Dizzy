Bill: I can connect to my desktop via teamviewer, so my house is probably fine. More worried about family than WiFi, didn’t need that stress.
Bill: (I’m sure they’re fine since my computer is working normally)
Bill: Is there. A star called Noah. Or a stage or a star life style. I woke up from an odd dream, dream me was being “contacted” by a “Noah star” in an empty amusement park but much like my awake self I don’t know of a Noah star. I got in trouble for being in the amusement park, then taken home... but picked up a book right before I woke up to confirm I wasn’t crazy... I could read planetarium on the book and you aren’t supposed to be able to read in a dream... Dream me even lampshaded the name, given I have some <:hmm:543194383885926403> feelings about it which was... meta, and the whole meta aspect jarred me a bit. Enough to get up and google “Noah star cluster”. 

...just a dream I’m sure.
Bill: I’m going back to bed.
Tikur (Kurtis): 
Tikur (Kurtis):

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I had a weird dream last night too! I dreamed we all went to this con that had tiny one person hotel rooms, and I walked out of my room to see some guy hovering creepily in front of someone door
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I didn’t think, I just reacted, and I went “why are you harassing my wife”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the guy was like “ok sure whatever” and left
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And it turned out that that was Leanna’s room and she fingerguns’ed at me and I fingerguns’ed back
