Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): as you can tell, I'm being super productive today
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good start!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I learned that the character is called Bugcat Capoo
Bill: Oh man I forgot about that. I should do that again.
Bill: I fell outta the habit.
Bill: 1) I‚Äôve got maybe one more week of 1:30 trips to Armonk left and I‚Äôm really going to miss them. 
2) Haven‚Äôt had such a relaxing long drive in forever~ ‚ò∫Ô∏è Came up up with half dozen more Claude Lysithea shorts.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I thought you hated that drive
Bill: For which reason?
Bill: Usually it‚Äôs 2:30 hours rather than 1:30, so I‚Äôm enjoying that (it‚Äôll go back to normal when school starts again).
Bill: My problem with long drives I‚Äôve said before is that my thoughts wander during them and for the last while that‚Äôs been a fast track to depressing thoughts.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ohhh ok I didn't realize it had goten shorter
Aldus Larian (Jess): The thoughts is why I thought you didn't like them
Bill: üëç
Bill: I originally wrote my RWBY characters on drive to and from Rowan. Figured out the mechanics of Sherwood's bow, Sona's history...
Bill: A two hour drive can be pretty productive creative time.
Bill: and when I need to make sure I remember something I just click siri and add a reminder, like so:
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Day one of being a home renter: the garage door has broken, the WiFi won‚Äôt work, and I need to power wash the porch
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Stressful but thank gosh my dad is here
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): welcome to adulting! üôÉ
Bill: https://complimentr.com/api important: this is an API that gives you a compliment.
Bill: some of which...
Bill: `{"compliment":"9 out of 10 doctors say you have decidedly ravishing thighs"}` <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): {"compliment":"i've heard you have exceptionally splendid feet"}
Bill: Get on that.

Nokri (Marisa): when i saw game grumps live, they were saying philadelphia was the only place that boo'd during their shows
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's because Philly knows they're assholes, but they don't care <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUOgZVl8SdY
Bill: Excause I've never denied I'm asshole and I'm from jersey!
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats cuz you want people to think you are mean for some reason
Bill: I dunno if I want them to think I'm mean so much as I think I am mean? Or at least not nice?
Aldus Larian (Jess): why you want people to think you are not nice tho?
Bill: Idk man. Self esteem shit.

Kaio Vermino (Lee): woah nice
Bill: No fort. I have four boxes left remember?
Nokri (Marisa): Fourt
