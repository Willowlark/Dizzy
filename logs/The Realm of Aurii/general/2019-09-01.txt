Bill: And since Jen and Jeremy asked me yesterday if I was doing one, would any of you be interested in coming to a proper house warming? Probably late September early October? Iâ€™ve been kind of on the fence with it, figured youâ€™d be too busy or whatever the case may be, but Iâ€™m trying to think half full for a change. 

Otherwise people can trickle over if/when they feel like it, no event needed.
Bill: Lemme @everyone that.
Andrew: I am.
