Nokri (Marisa): there are SO many flavors. banana is pretty good, and they also just came out with uhhhh something special for yokohama. CHESTNUT yeah yokohama is famous for chestnuts so there's a special chestnut kitkat for that. i don't know how it's different from the ordinary chestnut kitkats though
Nokri (Marisa): im trying to find a list of all flavors ever but so far i can only find what they sell on their site
https://nestle.jp/brand/kit/product/

Nokri (Marisa): it's stuff everyone probably knows though and it'd be a long post so i'm gonna. picrew or something instead. but if anyone wants advice from a suicidal person hmu
Aldus Larian (Jess): Depart the wisdom
Nokri (Marisa): i throw it into the ocean in a biodegradable bag so it doesn't make the fish depressed
Bill: Just do it. If you didn’t want to share, you wouldn’t have said anything about it.
Nokri (Marisa): that's the thing. i said i want to share. but feel it's pointless and useless and will make people annoyed, just like i'm making people feel now. <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): You not making anyone annoyed silly!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's not pointless or useless. It's always good to educate about this type of thing. Even if some people may know it, others may not. Even still, a refresher is always beneficial
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea for sure!
Nokri (Marisa): WRITTEN KITTEN IS GONE it's a website that would post a picture of a cat for every 100 words you type
what am i supposed to write stupidly long monologues on now
Nokri (Marisa): are any of you suicidal because i don't want to post this and make u worse so speak now
Nokri (Marisa): i wanna delete my post ;-;

El🆓de Faun (Tom): I love that bug dude from space ghost
