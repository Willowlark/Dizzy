Bill: I mean, I don’t care too much, but we’re going to blame Dennis for everything now.
Nokri (Marisa): should've taken passive aggressive pictures with signs like "welcome aboard, dennis!" and everyone holding fancy fizzy drinks and wearing party hats and sent them to him <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Bill: Fun fact, they're mostly married too.
Bill: shout out to Japneet yesterday who said effectively the following: "Oh yes, I really need to have a friend of mine meet you. Well, you Gord and Vincent." Gord was the one to lampshade that she named the two people in relationships.

Now, the context was later sort of established as her friend needs a visa (Vincent is on a work visa) and is an AI developer (which Gord would have an interest in), but in the moment I was like 'I mean, okay, thanks, you don't even know me?'.
Aldus (Jess): does she know you're a huge weeb
Bill: OH, is that it?
Bill: I guess I'll just go bury myself with my manga collection.
Bill: brb never
