N🆗ri (Marisa): Watch cooking ASMR videos from Japanese youtubers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also another thing I've learned is baking/broiling is convenient because it's less cleanup ☝🏻

Andrew: So I shoulda heeded leaving today
Andrew: Just clocked out
Andrew: Small Story time to vent
A lady was shopping in the store at exactly 12 when we closed. We made half an hour, 15 min and closing reminders. She comes in line at 12:05 with 2 full carts. We ring up the order and it comes to around $400, but the lady didnt have enough to pay for it all, not by much; it was about $100 over.  So we spend about 20 some minutes one by one voiding half of her order, and all the while shes telling her kid that the kid put too much in the cart. After finally getting what she wanted rung up it took another 10min because there was an issue with her card. The mean time im running back and forth taking back cold items and just wanting to leave.
Bill: psych don't get fucking real on me damn.
N🆗ri (Marisa): exciting days in Shop Rite™
