Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOM!

El🆓de Faun (Tom): 312!
Nokri (Marisa): old man
El🆓de Faun (Tom): HOW FUCKING DARE YOU
Nokri (Marisa): little kids develop super rapidly so two kids who are each 1 year old can have vastly different stages of development depending on if they're 13 months or 18 months
Nokri (Marisa): I'M SO SORRY
Nokri (Marisa): how could i

Nokri (Marisa): Other Friends is such a good song it was #4 trending on YouTube 🤘
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would still love to cosplay running boy but the only shirt I was able to find on ebay is a size medium 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): this game seems kinda fun but at the same time i dont know if id have enough balls to play it:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FVM5R4K?fbclid=IwAR0kT8h1go1JAlUbTnI0bLbgvEdw3yEFuPibe5mDq5HpRg8zxDnrhO-cCTE
Bill: I love that kind of game. I just can’t get people together.
Nokri (Marisa): Cards I’d be really really good at
Nokri (Marisa): I wanna be the poker that’s like my entire elementary school life
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo i think those are the punishment cards for when you refuse to do the chllege
Aldus Larian (Jess): i feel like half of the cards id be ok with and the other half id be like nuuuuu
Bill: These kinds also tend to more college party vibe than couples game night?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i mean i wasnt implying it was for "couples game night"
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz that would severely deplete the amount of people who could play
Bill: I mean, would you play with, Justin and Rayna, the other two in you d&d group are dating iirc?
Nokri (Marisa): the reviews specifically say it's a pretty bad game for couples
Aldus Larian (Jess): no one else is dating in our group
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea someone said they couldnt do some cards because of being in a relationship
Nokri (Marisa): it's all about getting in another people's personal space, yeee like the one card that says to sniff someone else's butt
Nokri (Marisa): it seems like you can't always choose who you interact with
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:shrek:554719881216524310>
Nokri (Marisa): what a kawaii morning lee
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea like i feel like some of the cards would be fun but others would be like too far
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Kowaii
Nokri (Marisa): YOU SPEAK NIHONGOS!!!
Bill: Yeah. That’s what I mean, cards are written to be flirty and awkward which is cool when everyone’s single and ready to mingle, but it’ll be uncomfortable for being flirty with or being flirted with when your part of a relationship.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmm i didnt really see any that seemed flirty
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Sniffing butts is flirty for dogs
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): .. or furries??
Bill: You know what I mean....
Bill: You probably want a similar game with a more “never have I ever” twist on it. Something where it’s less about “me and person X do awkward” and more like “I did awkward thing myself/with SO  and have to talk about it”.
Bill: Imo anyway.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just didnt see anything i thought would be specifically awkward to do with any of my friends in like a flirt way? idk like saying "moist" to each other isnt very flirty
Aldus Larian (Jess): unless you're saying getting in other peoples space is just flirty?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That one's just rude
Nokri (Marisa): p.rude
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea some of them are insulting :/
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like im not gonna get it but id be interested to look through the cards lol
Bill: I must be understanding it wrong then. Nevermind b
Nokri (Marisa): when i get back from the doctor's today i can stay inside my house until cce <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

Glonk: <@386874959009415170> would you have any use for this? Or if anyone wants
Glonk: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): No thanks, but thanks for asking!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I thawed frozen Brussels sprouts to make with dinner tonight and I wasn't sure how they'd be to cook but I threw them in a little oil and drained with salt and pepper and let them caramelize a little and then threw some golden raisins in with them and mmmph 🤤👌🏻
Nokri (Marisa): bbbbrusselssssprouts??//
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo those sound good
