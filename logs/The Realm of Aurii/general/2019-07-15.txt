Tikur (Kurtis): Had an interesting turn of events in the midst of my sleep paralysis last night.  So as I lay there staring in the eyes of what I can only assume is a demon, unable to move; I felt two ghostly arms wrap around me in a very tender hug/spooning feeling.  In that moment all I remember say is "I don't know you but thanks" and then finally was able to get out of the paralysis üëå
