Bill: I don’t... technically have he lease yet. The credit guy left early and they made us wait so long so I’m going back Monday to do the actual credit part. Price is negotiated just need to do it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh it's a lease? Neato
Bill: Ye. Makes the most sense.
Bill: Tired now though.
Bill: I’ve been feeling extra lonely recently... had the idea it’s cause of concrunch. *roots for everyone to finish crunch so they can play again*
N🆗ri (Marisa): MY DRESS HAS POCKETS

N🆗ri (Marisa): I told my cousin about the pocket cannolis and she walked away from me

N🆗ri (Marisa): We’re in a multi million dollar establishment at a wedding that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and my sister walks into the bathroom and says “hey guys who’s in line for the pisser”
N🆗ri (Marisa): More people wearing fur than there are animals in a zoo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Keeping it real
N🆗ri (Marisa): It was very segregated though and I imagine the YouTube footage will be highly edited. We didn’t interact with the bride’s family in any way, and the bride and groom never came to say hi to us (the groom’s family) during the whole 4 hour reception.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We partied in a little corner. there was a videographer stationed there who quickly packed up and moved to another location.
Bill: nice. who wants to be on youtube anyway.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 933 thousand+ subscribers tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): The wedding was fun but obviously meticulously orchestrated
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You're supposed to make a point to at least TRY to go to every table ettoquite wise
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): As the bride and groom
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah I don’t think they did that. I saw them go up to the table of bridesmaids/groomsmen but that’s about it. Maaaybe the brides parents? But they didn’t go up to any of the other 20 or so tables, and there was no table intermingling
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh damn I mean as long as they didn't great all the brides family and non of the groom's then I think it's ok
Bill: big weddings seem like a mess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m distraught over my age I was the alcohol gofer for my sister and they didn’t card me but they carded her and she’s 12 years older 
I’m a granny
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sylvia has notified me of both a gas leak and a water leak in the house in the last 24 hours I’m so proud of her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHAT omg are you guys ok?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): How she notify you?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye! We good thanks to her

Bill: Her name should be lassie at this point.
Bill: When the fuck am I going to do laundry before Katsu. Yikes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do laundry at Katsu
Dry it by hanging it off the balcony
Bill: I just had four sequential deja vu instances.
Bill: Reddit really does has a repost problem.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can’t tell if my family hates me or if they purposefully avoid me to give me space.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh freaking romance is back
Bill: Anyone who hates you is scum, as far as I’m concerned.
Bill: *Ye fuck romance*
Bill: *Unless it’s a princely abused boi who just needs someone to genuinely love him*
N🆗ri (Marisa): *no they couldn’t use that name*
