N👌kri (Marisa): 96neko has such a good voice. i didn't even realize she was a girl until i met her and listening to her songs is insane. how does she have such range
N👌kri (Marisa): she sounds like a guy one moment and then BAM girl vocals
N👌kri (Marisa): astounding
Bill: I’m a selfie stick.
Bill: That me.
Bill: Is jacket shorter than shirt fashionable or not fashionable. No right? Or yes when open?
Aldus Larian (Jess): When open I'd say ya
Bill: 
Bill: I’m getting that weird lonely mood I get where I all annoying and stressed. Sorry in advance.
Tikur (Kurtis): *Hugs*
N👌kri (Marisa): why the homestuck epilogue so horrible
N👌kri (Marisa): people are so angry at it they made their own website and epilogue instead. good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh boy
N👌kri (Marisa): the series itself was so good. and the epilogue just. destroys it all <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N👌kri (Marisa): ||one character, dirk, commits suicide. another character, jake, was in love with him and after dirk's death he gets raped and married to Jane against his will? and there's an image of jake with his unwanted child sobbing at dirk's grave? it's so messed up||
Aldus Larian (Jess): W T F
N👌kri (Marisa): character development ---> 🚽
N👌kri (Marisa): but the weird thing is that homestuck was so GOOD at handling those elements before. like, ||a big part of dirk's growth was that he didn't want to grow up into a big jerk like his alternative universe self, which is apparently the reason he kills himself? it portrayed characters very realistically like roxie and her alcohol issue and the whole "children with unbearable responsibility thrust upon them".|| then the ending was way rushed and now we have this heaping pile of garbage <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wtf. Why eish it when no one was expecting it anyway
N👌kri (Marisa): there was a really, really big pause during homestuck, the gigapause, which lasted over a year i think and during which a looot of fans moved on to other things because of the lack of content. there was something called paradox space which was like unofficial-official one-shots by fanartists endorsed by the author but it slowed down after a few months.

the homestuck kickstarter was the most successful kickstarter in history when it ended and raised like 2 million dollars i think? lemme double check that
N👌kri (Marisa): yeah almost $2.5 million
N👌kri (Marisa): and most of that money got stolen and put towards another game, which is why we still don't have the full game ~5 years later. the gigapause was spent trying to recoup the lost kickstarter money and work on a new game studio
N👌kri (Marisa): i think maybe hussie was just tired at this point. he didn't think homestuck would ever get as popular as it did and i don't think he intended it to go on for so *long*
N👌kri (Marisa): so people had been waiting like a year for the ending of homestuck and we got the homestuck anime we always desired but at what cost? at what cost.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn Homestuck be wack
N👌kri (Marisa): omg i'm sewing this wig and just the smell of being near synthetic hair sent me into convention shock. it's like being smacked with a yaoi paddle out of nowhere. i feel like i'm late for 3 different panels.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It must mean that you are
El🆓de Faun (Tom): do you own a yoai paddle from the old days?
N👌kri (Marisa): i don't own a yaoi paddle but as of today i own *an actual katana*
Tikur (Kurtis): You studied the blade
N👌kri (Marisa): given the time of day and the position of the stars i'd say the 3 panels i'm late for are
-the 18+ dating game i help host
-con horror stories
-a game of werewolf OR guests against humanity
N👌kri (Marisa): i feel like just by being within a certain radius of the sword, police are gonna catch m e
El🆓de Faun (Tom): did you say it was sharpened? o.o
N👌kri (Marisa): it's a 100% legit sword i'm scared to touch it but it can definitely draw blood
N👌kri (Marisa): 👀
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 👀
El🆓de Faun (Tom): i have one but it doesnt have a blade O.o
N👌kri (Marisa): where did it go
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It was never there to begin with <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: That was the most adult breakdown of homestuck I ever heard. Props.
Bill: 
Bill: I wonder where you can buy worry stones. I like the one on my fidget cube, I’ve gotten used to using it during the workshop. Fidget cube is just bulky for my pocket.
