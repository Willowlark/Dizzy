The HOA office. I could walk home. If it was the shop I’d just sew owo
Erik: one of my previous jobs when I did assembly, there was a guy who had been there a long time and was a really good assembly worker, but when things slowed down and he didn't have anything to do he'd just peace out and say "No work, I go home"

Aldus Larian (Jess): Na my buddy got fired 😭 just like all my work friend's
