Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof bad cramps today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What a morning
Glonk: Dab the pain away
Bill: yo I'm watching an episode of Psych with a vampire theme and the guy's got this massive nosebleed and I'm a little wigged out and like...
Bill: I was never squimish with blood before? Wonder when that happened.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmm yeah first class isnt happenin today, standing is pain
Bill: 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do you have warm things for pain relief 
I felt it ten seconds after I woke up like a truck driving into me. Good times.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Georgia what’s ur favorite color(s) today is mega bow day
Bill: OwO blessed by the Mawisa of Bows.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bowisa
Bill: That sounds like a Bowsette variant.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: But smol and cute rather than sexy and sexy.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): kinda like some boosette
Bill: Boosette also sexy tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): boosette cosplay tends to fall more on cute
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): at least from the ones ive seen
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the art on the other hand
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I see more of the art than cosplay.
Bill: I'd say most of the cosplay is less sexy than the art cause *lol reality doesn't work like that*.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Light blue -w-
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel guilty missing this class but I only missed it once before and I can get the notes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _but I feel bad_
Bill: It fine.
Bill: i reaaaally gotta fold my laundry.
Bill: BORING
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nya
Aldus Larian (Jess): Blep
Bill: Don’t abandon me in the world of barely working!
Aldus Larian (Jess): *fondly remembers being at work while you had off for two weekend in December*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 🐸🍵
N🆗ri (Marisa): I hate threading bobbins on this machine because they decided it would be great to put a sharp edge above where the thread goes and if you don’t hold it a certain way the thread gets cut
N🆗ri (Marisa): No one thought that might be an issue eh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NICE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What the fuck it’s 80 degrees
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was wondering why it felt so warm today
Bill: isn't weather great.
Bill: I wonder if the cherry trees in Dover are still in bloom. 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): god i wish i wasnt at work
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so i could.... go outside
N🆗ri (Marisa): Why would you want to go outside
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because am cold in here
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oo
Assume the fetal position for warmth
Bill: outside == photos
N🆗ri (Marisa): Also consider: indoor photos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Man I’d shoot but I’m not free til 6 and got nothin to shoot at skool
Bill: It make sense for da locals. Even if you have the most enthusiasm for it.
Bill: Usually.
Bill: I'd yeet outta work a little early if any wants to go check.
Bill: I theoretically could go for the trees themselves but tbh landscape photography bores the shit out of me.
Glonk: Isn't it supposed to rain soon until tomorrow afternoon
Bill: is it?
Glonk: Unless Google has lied to me
Bill: oh shit ye. It look so nice out now though.
Bill: according to weather app, it's already raining tho.
Bill: idk man.
Bill: this episode of psych is such a mood damn.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Can I eat these?
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's raining now
Bill: rip.
Bill: I should edit photos but taking them is more fun so I wanna do that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom and I went on a lol hike and it started raining just as we got back to the car
Bill: hasn't gotten to here yet but rip.
N🆗ri (Marisa): SHOOT Passover starts tonight
I gotta shovel some bread into my mouth
N🆗ri (Marisa): Goes into Minecraft to kill a sheep and smear its blood on my door
Bill: 50/50 chance owo
Bill: Iiii think imma check.
Bill: Imma going now. Pray for me. Or meetup.
Bill: That uh. Line of trees by the river? Might not be sakuras.
Bill: I was out of Allegra this morning I can see the pollen.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Plum or dogwood?
Bill: Whatever those are.
Bill: There’s two sakuras that already went white. By the rock Kurtis stood on.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Woah yeah that definitely ain’t Sakura. Mmmmmmagnolias?
Bill: These haven’t bloomed yet.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🤷
N🆗ri (Marisa): They’re too big for Sakura and plum and dogwood but they look too dark for magnolias unless it gets brighter when they open
Aldus Larian (Jess): I ask my mom
Bill: The sakuras are all too high to really use too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Would anyone wanna go bowling later?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ya :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wii bowling should have online multiplayer smh
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): True
Bill: Well that was quick. If it’s this humid, there should at least be pretty things to look at.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yee
Bill: Maybe I’ll swing by horseshoe lake. Those trees on the walk probably haven’t bloomed either.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Stuff up here blooms later than stuff further south
Bill: Also friendship better than bowling but. They have booze at bowling.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that sounds like a way to smash someone's face in with a 15 pound ball
Bill: When?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wait what do you mean
Aldus Larian (Jess): You'd be going with friends so that's also friendship
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also I haven't decided yet
Bill: Cause I’m already out and I wanna eat dinner by 8 to make today a fasting day.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok well if it's not convenient for you then you don't have to come it was just an idea
Aldus Larian (Jess): I haven't picked a time cuz I don't even know who would wanna go yet
Bill: ,... if it wasn’t convenient for me I wouldn’t be the one asking about it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I just don't have a time yet so I can't tell you when to eat
Bill: And that’s perfectly fine. Not a matter of “convenience“.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok well I'm gonna see if anyone else wants to go first anyway 3 is a weird number for bowling
Aldus Larian (Jess): Would anyone else here wanna go? <@245270932602486784> <@334090409389195266>  <@386874959009415170>  prob to far right?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I gotta be somewhere at 7 so I cant :/
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Sowwy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Das fine is last minute anyway
Glonk: You doing the 16/8 fasting too bill?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): tonight? yeah too far
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but thanks for asking ❤
Bill: Mhmm.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea no prob
Bill: Trader brought it up way back at the start, Gord has been doing it at the office for like a year, I didn’t build a habit cause I needed a baseline for my caloric intake without it, but reintroducing it has been quiet successful at breaking the plateauing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think Tom and I just gonna do something else instead, save bowling for a better planned time 😅
Bill: <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: Go on a cute date night.
Glonk: 👆
Bill: In Minecraft.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol we're leaving in a min
Bill: Aww.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): We going skatingyo
Bill: There a rink around here or outside?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Florham park
Bill: That’s east of Morristown! 😮
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
Bill: *so that’s what you travel for* XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's not alchohol 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): So yea Tom will drive for it
Bill: Do roller rinks serve booze? I feel they’re like bowling alleys like that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sometimes but it's not a bar
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thanks main purpose of the building isn't booze
Aldus Larian (Jess): I've never seen a roller rink with booze
Bill: I couldn’t have more than 12 last time I was in one.
Bill: I do need to see if I can pick up skating again... I could as a kid, but at the cosplay stuff I was too scared to see if I can while holding camera.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I mean I'm not gonna say it doesn't exist but Ive never seen it
Bill: Who knows. They barely exist anymore.
Bill: Now I wanna go. >.>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Seems like a laibiliry issue
Bill: Oh true.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Drunk people on skates sounds like a mistake
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): Skating is already super aggressive don’t do drinks kids
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But drunk people with 10lb stone balls on highly polished floors is fine
Bill: That was what I was thinking.
Aldus Larian (Jess): There's def a difference between people throwing balls down a designated area where there are no people vs people propelling themselves around a link filled with other bodies
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): valid
Bill: Do another trip there and invite people.
Bill: I wanna go.
Bill: Also flora gave me the address of the NYC karaoke bar for whenever we get into NYC.
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s a sport centered around skating that involves slamming others into walls and pulling them back. If only bowling was the same.
Bill: Jen does that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): My sister broke her legs from it so many times. I almost joined a team in japan
