Tikur (Kurtis): You can't tell me what to do you're not my really dad.
Bill: Fair.
Bill: Do they ACTUALLY have cell jammers in Delaware? Maybe there IS a reason for Gord to deny its existence.
Eliran (Halim): I have wonderful reception here in Delaware 
Bill's words are lies 
Delaware is a peaceful, existing 
Kind state
Bill: Now to resist my compulsive need to be early.
Elfriede (Tom): goes to delaware
Elfriede (Tom): entire state is madmax
Elfriede (Tom): how....
Eliran (Halim): Bill where you staying
Eliran (Halim): We can pick you up
Bill: Candle wood suites.
Elfriede (Tom): Discord... So quiet...so sassy
Nokri (Marisa): I was dying this morning and I messaged the one person I could think of who might be free and able to bring aspirin to my apartment
but when I’m dying it usually only lasts for a few hours so by the time she messaged back I was ok but I appreciate she still offered to bring medicine ;u;
Now I just need to wait until I can stand up again so I can find my glasses. I think the last time I had them I was laying on the ground in front of the fridge.
Nokri (Marisa): i did it i stood up and found my glasses \(owo)/
Elfriede (Tom): Migraines ? 😟
Nokri (Marisa): naw <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
my glasses fell when i collapsed trying to move between the two bathrooms (there's 2 in my apartment, one with a toilet and one with a sink/bathtub) because my legs wouldn't support me anymore yehaw. luckily the trashcan was also there.
Nokri (Marisa): miraculous ladybug gives its viewers an incredibly unhealthy amount of secondhand embarassment
Elfriede (Tom): You collapsed because of ladybugs secondhand embarrassment! Oh no! 😱
Elfriede (Tom): ~~Do you chronically pass out?~~
Nokri (Marisa): i used to sometimes in high school health class because it was really gross and i would raise my hand to ask to be excused, but we had like 200 kids per class so by the time they saw me most of the time i was white as a sheet and fading fast, until one of the teachers was finally like "yo. if you're gonna pass out you can leave without asking." :3c
Idk why, i was fine with it but my brain just shuts down. did that at a museum i willingly went to too. walked into a room about the human body and woke up being carried up some stairs to the outside. woo.

otherwise it happens every few months. dunno a reason why, doctors say i'm mega super healthy aside from needing a few vitamins. not just passing out but full on gross death grips (the gross details which u shouldn't read if eating is that my body basically expels literally everything, anything in my stomach and bowels and sweat from every pore and even uncontrollable tears, i'm unable to walk or stand up, everything is clammy, and my temperature repeatedly goes from freezing to sweltering and back. plus it feels like my insides are being stabbed repeatedly. but no migrane!! lasts for around 3 hours.).

i can track approximately when it *might* happen, but I won't actually know until it starts. yehaw.
Nokri (Marisa): don't worry it doesn't happen at cons
Nokri (Marisa): may y'all never experience such sickness, it bad.
Aldus (Jess): Omg <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 😭 I had no idea that happens to you! That's terrible. They really have no explaination?
Nokri (Marisa): ye <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> i've googled it a few times, the internet says maybe hormones? but it's not a regular thing, like luckily it hasn't happened since i came to japan until now. last time was maybe november or something.
Aldus (Jess): 😭  could it be some form of colitis? I don't thank that makes people pass out though
Nokri (Marisa): i don't think so, it's trackable because it's always the first day of my period
Elfriede (Tom): It happens to our friend Chris too
Elfriede (Tom): Alot of times it's just sudden blood pressure change
Nokri (Marisa): do they have an explanation for it?
Nokri (Marisa): ooo
Aldus (Jess): Oh shit your right Tom!
Aldus (Jess): No they don't have one for her either 😭
Nokri (Marisa): do they have any way of controlling it? oh nooo
Elfriede (Tom): Yeahhh not really 😭
Nokri (Marisa): today i woke up at 8 but slept in until 2 because i could feel it coming, that wonderful debilitating pain, hoping i could sleep it out but lol nope <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): me and chris should cosplay that anime about the body we can be blood cells
Nokri (Marisa): https://78.media.tumblr.com/4396fd67014d4bd09b8e40fddafb6a3f/tumblr_pbv9b6oH0O1v1hotuo1_500.gif
Nokri (Marisa): right now everyone has lolis moving stuff inside their body. that's life.
Aldus (Jess): 😭 are you ok now?
Nokri (Marisa): ye i have some dull pain but i'm fine. <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> I could go get ibuprofen or something around the corner but i decided to lay low and i skipped going to my weekly meeting shhh
Nokri (Marisa): loli cells are working hard
