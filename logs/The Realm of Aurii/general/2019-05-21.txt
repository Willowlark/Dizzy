Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Staples guy is much stronger than us all
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Framing my posters has been so good because it helps me cut down on the amount of posters I own
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If I don’t care about it enough to frame it, it’s probably worth parting with
Nokri (Marisa): or storing in a big binder 🗄
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just invest in one of those poster display racks like they have anywhere you buy posters from
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then you can display lots in a compact space
Nokri (Marisa): or a **giant tube**
Nokri (Marisa): with some fluorescent green lighting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): theres a suspiciously high amount of red to these posters
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): granted theyre rwby, spiderman, fallout so i guess thats not entirely surprising lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like all 3 micheals around me are out of stock of 11x17 poster frames
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wtf i just needed one more
Nokri (Marisa): it's graduation season, popular present
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its out of stock online and the nearest micheals that sells it is 30 mins away wtf
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Walmart or target?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): nope
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): amazon HAD it but its unavailable
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i wonder if this poster frame type is getting discontinued
Bill: It showed up on Spotify this morning I’ve never heard it before, but Mess by Real Friends has a lot of verses that are cliffnoting me recently.
Bill: I like it.
Bill: It set off my allergies big time, but windows open and loud music in this weather is great.
