Bill: There’s a woman in the booth across from me who looks strangely like Georgias mom.
Elfriede (Tom): Pfft
Bill: I'm watching this comedy series and they have this recurring bit where a couple goes to buy a house/car/bed and asks to 'try it out'. Then they have a huge argument in the middle of the store and make everyone super awkward, only to be like 'yes this is perfect'.
Bill: I love it.
Bill: the morning meeting is pissing me off this morning, it's so pointless. I should just drop, the audio quality is crap.
Bill: *All internal remote meetings are so poorly done*
Bill: I've spent 20 minutes on a call, but no one on the other side had audio on.
Bill: *wow* they gave up.
Bill: We have a new brand logo.
Bill: weeeee
Bill: (Looks crappy cause video over screen share)
Bill: I could never work in creative.
Bill: 
Aldus (Jess): ooo thats nice
Aldus (Jess): clean
Aldus (Jess): prett sure thats roboto slab
Bill: As opposed to now.
Aldus (Jess): yea new one better
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: I can do simple.
Aldus (Jess): new one works better for branding though, its versitile, les sumbersome since the cube gives you the option of using only that if the situation allows
Bill: Think they're doing that with the new wesbite.
Bill: the cube is the menu.
Bill: It was hard to hear.
Aldus (Jess): yea, i tried to sell my company on a less cumbersome logo but no one listens to me
Bill: 
Bill: jeez, another random heavy storm.
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao I read that and it started down pouring in the same moment
Bill: and it's blue skies again.
Aldus (Jess): *hold off on lunch*
Bill: Tom Jess, you see ant man 2 yet?
Bill: I need to see that and Jurassic world 2 still.
Aldus (Jess): We never saw either of the first ones
Bill: Oof. Parents saw an old coworker of Moms just before we left so now it’s powwow hour.
Elfriede (Tom): Weren't you guys just at Chili's <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Yup.
Bill: The same restaurant.
Elfriede (Tom): :3c
