Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the camera is finally capturing it

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Sounds fake, but okay*
Tikur (Kurtis): So apparently there is an active shooter in the Rockaway area

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What the fuck
Glonk: Rockaway nj or Rockaway ny?

Tikur (Kurtis): Just happened, one of our co-workers is at her son's school for graduation and they got put on lockdown because of it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wtffff
Tikur (Kurtis): Not at the school tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Bill: It’s all the rain.
Bill: Gotta be it.
Bill: ~~it’s supposed to stop soon right. Please~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Rain isn't a reason to shoot people
Bill: There is no good reason to shoot people...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Obviously
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just felt like you were cheapening the situation with jokes...
Bill: I deal with all sad things with jokes. Humor is my defense mechanism.
Aldus Larian (Jess): K
Bill: ...
Bill: There’s nothing to cheapen anyway. No shooter. Armed robbery who got away.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did you know that when you made the joke?
Bill: No. I meant what I said, I crack jokes to deal with sad scenarios. Rowan had a shooting threat and I was cracking them the whole way to class, about how my jacket will give me +1 armor against bullets. 

I just wanted to share the good news with you that there wasn’t a shooting.
Nokri (Marisa): it's a bit hard to segway from a serious topic like shootings to a more casual topic without belittling the seriousness of the shooting, especially on the internet where hours can pass and the message is still there fresh on everyone's screen
Nokri (Marisa): i know how we can make infinite bunny ears
Nokri (Marisa): but it will pollute the earth horribly
Tikur (Kurtis): The best kid of pollution
Nokri (Marisa): 
Andrew: Another severe storm alert, my goodness

Tikur (Kurtis): If y'all could hear this kid getting dialated at our office you'd think we were killing him
Tikur (Kurtis): Straight top of lungs screaming.
Nokri (Marisa): why are you murdering that child
El🆓de Faun (Tom): My brother was like that yo
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Cept during root canal but same thing roght
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dialations don't even hurt 😂
El🆓de Faun (Tom): EYE DRIPS THO
Aldus Larian (Jess): Psh
Nokri (Marisa): when i was little the dialation drops burned like the heat of a thousand suns
Tikur (Kurtis): ☝️ yeah and that's why 4 people had to hold him down cause he was kicking and screaming
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): jeez
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I remember freaking out the first time I got mine done, but I wasn't screaming like that lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh damn
Tikur (Kurtis): Yeah I felt so bad. 😭 We had to do another test on him and so our one tech made a pinkie promise that we wouldn't put any more drops in 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awww nooo! I don't think I've ever had anything sting besides the initial drop
Andrew: It wasnt neccesarily the sting, but i could never han dle eyedrops well.
Andrew: Something about putting some in my eye made me twitchy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Huzzah moved in!
Andrew: Looking good
Nokri (Marisa): It even has your name on it
Nokri (Marisa): beginning of july i'll be able to keep my online status on all the time
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Nokri (Marisa): amelio and agus messaged me about the sbbb application i put in, saying that apps closed today and they're starting the first round of interviews now, but that if i was "still interested in playing we won't need yours (wink wink)" and saying to expect the official invite at the beginning of july, and borrach is going to be in that as a judge and people aren't allowed to fraternize with each other outside of the game so i can be online without him sending me a billion messages
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): woooo!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): good shit
El🆓de Faun (Tom): do you play every day when you play that?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): and how long?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): like a month?
Nokri (Marisa): yee, every day for 3-4 months or until you get kicked off the game, one person gets kicked off weekly
Nokri (Marisa): there's a spectator server for people to just watch, and a forum where all the progress and notable events are posted
Nokri (Marisa): here's the current forum but it's pretty bare bones, i think they're going to make a new one when it starts
https://epicmafia.com/topic/92572
El🆓de Faun (Tom): damn thats nuts, how were you originally introduced to this
El🆓de Faun (Tom): it seems rather tightnit
El🆓de Faun (Tom): or small
Nokri (Marisa): that's a good question <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
i just joined the server and i really like how they do it, everybody who joins is hidden so you can only see the hosts (there's close to 30 people in this server) and then when the game starts they'll dramatically introduce the players and take them off of hidden
Nokri (Marisa): i think i joined epic mafia in my senior year of high school, and i joined because people would play homestuck mafia and dangan mafia (dangan mafia was one of the biggest rooms on the site), and then i moved to the sandbox room to play when dangan and homestuck weren't active and just stuck around there. it's a site with a lot of regulars who know each other and i was one of the regulars, so when epicmafia started declining and getting buggy the people of the sandbox room (and a few from the games room) started doing these things called ORGs which are basically parodies of reality tv shows. i think ogwam asked me to be in sbbb3 a while back and i figured why not, and then amelio sent me a link to this new one saying they're accepting returnees and wanted me to join
Nokri (Marisa): the site might've started declining because of how harsh it was to new users. i stuck around just to waste time but i was constantly the first to be killed for a while, until like a month in somebody was like "they've been around long enough so give them a break"
but new users were always targeted on site, in-game and through a kind of hazing since everyone on the site likes to jokingly hate on each other
Nokri (Marisa): thanks for coming to my ted talk
Nokri (Marisa): Name nouns that start with W
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): warts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): windows, walls
