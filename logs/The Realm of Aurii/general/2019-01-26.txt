Bill: *I’m being chased around a police station by a albino weight lifting bald guy*
Bill: 5 hours to clear the police station which is about a third of the game.
Bill: Not bad.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Which one? RE2 remake?
Bill: Ye.
Dirty Lego (Tom): NICU 👌
Bill: They did a perfect job of removing the frustrating tank controls while keeping you still vulnerable to the jumps.
Bill: All the backtracking doesn’t feel like a chore.
Bill: I got most of the puzzles done... I just needed a safe code (too lazy to double check basement for missed code), and a box I had the key for but I couldn’t get back to. Twas fun doing them, again cause it’s much more natural walking around in over the shoulder third person.
Bill: ~~unfortunately they kept inventory management hell but it’s kinda necessary~~
Bill: Lol the reddit is all memes about mr x.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Is the camera still locked in the corners?
Dirty Lego (Tom): I feel like you still need that to keep the original feel
Bill: nope. The big part of this being a remake.
Bill: It's 3rd person over the shoulder.
Bill: Instead of the 'horror' aspect being 'I can't turn and walk at the same time so I'mma get eaten' it's 'I can't track a licker fast enough, my recoil is too high from the fast movements, I'm getting murderated'.
Bill: But there's a lot to comment on as a long time RE player.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh okay nice
N🆗ri (Marisa): i started ray's jacket but then the sewing machine started bird nesting and i ran out of thread in both the spool and the bobbin at the same time isn't that cool
so i took it as a universal sign and gave up but the jacket is coming along really nicely otherwise and i can finish it in an hour or two once i feel like doing it again
Dirty Lego (Tom): Very understandable
N🆗ri (Marisa): just found out my grandmother was laundering money for the mafia and letting the mafia use her house as a safehouse before she died and was poisoning my mother
i knew about the poison part but not the mafia bit 🤔
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh
Dirty Lego (Tom): Very nice
Dirty Lego (Tom): Very nice
Bill: wow.
Bill: I’ve never worn contacts getting a haircut before. I’m just making funny faces at myself in the mirror.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHAT omg 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah omg what's it like being able to see your hair being cut?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No lol your grandma
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you making funny faces while you hairdresser cuts your hair
being totally straight-laced and professional but making silly faces at the same time to confuse them

my family is weird there's a big wedding the week before katsu and im not looking forward to it
Bill: In good will cause I donate a bunch of clothes... there’s like a dozen wii fit here.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how much are they? omw
N🆗ri (Marisa): Going into a parking lot with lots of pedestrians
“Don’t run these people over”
“Don’t worry I will”
uHH pls no
Andrew: So is anyone following the new Vig Mignona situation?
Bill: Link! Link!
Andrew: https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/25/18197827/dragon-ball-super-broly-vic-mignogna-harassment-response
Bill: tbh I don’t think “he won’t sign my yaoi” is a valid complaint people.
Bill: But his track record of being a perv is well known.
Andrew: I never really cared for him
Andrew: although we were ina n elevator with him at ota
