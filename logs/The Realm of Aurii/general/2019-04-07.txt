Andrew: I just got a complaint HA
Andrew: I hate this place
N🆗ri (Marisa): what did karen complain about
Andrew: Who's karen
Aldus Larian (Jess): My mom
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess's mom complained right
jess's mom unfortunately embodies all angry middle aged women
Aldus Larian (Jess): My mom has never complained 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): You could.smack my.mom upside the head and she'd be like "I know your job is rough I'm sorry"
N🆗ri (Marisa): she sends the complaints out to her minions like a queen controlling her workers, that's why she can be the ideal <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): your mom trips and suddenly somewhere 5 different middle aged ladies start cursing
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Andrew: I dont complain
Andrew: When I'm shopping I go out of my way to not be that guy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye me too
Andrew: I know both sides now so I dont want to make it harder for people
N🆗ri (Marisa): andru what was your complaint we'll come beat that person up
Aldus Larian (Jess): Even when cashier's are rudento me I'm like "yea they're probably just having a rough day"
Andrew: She wanted us to honor a managers special price from anotger
Andrew: Store
Andrew: I told her we canr
Andrew: And she flipped
Andrew: We cant honor what another store manager does because hes not here
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've had workers get borderline angry at me in japan because i'd spill something and ask them for stuff to wipe it up myself like "can i have some more napkins i'm really sorry i spilled some water" and they'd be mortified like "nO WE'VE GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF DON'T WORRY"
Andrew: Also her store card was flagged for coupon and return abuse
N🆗ri (Marisa): how dare u not honor this scamming woman's promise from another person at another store
N🆗ri (Marisa): when that other person isn't there
N🆗ri (Marisa): someday i'm gonna go to your store and raise a ruckus and then send in a wonderfully praiseworthy feedback form about how you shut me down for being a neener
N🆗ri (Marisa): not today though the light is still flickering out and i'm awaiting my impending doom
N🆗ri (Marisa): am i enough of a weeb to apply for a dishwasher position at a local sushi store
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's prob run by Chinese speakers tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah the founder's name is definitely not japanese <:pew:543202259085950996>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): but do weebs care?
as a weeb, do i prioritize true japaneseness above all else, or do i instantly grab anything vaguely east asian and scream about how japanese it is?
what is the way?
N🆗ri (Marisa): do we embrace the philly sushi roll because it is a sushi, or do we sneer at it because no one in japan would name a sushi after philly and we are the elite weeb connoisseurs? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:thinku:543194478614413318> <:thinku:543194478614413318> <:thinku:543194478614413318> <:thinku:543194478614413318> <:minathink:544567715931750405> <:minathink:544567715931750405> <:minathink:544567715931750405> <:minathink:544567715931750405> <:minathink:544567715931750405> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996> <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is what aristotle-sama pondered millennia ago
N🆗ri (Marisa): アリストテレス様
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also the Philly roll is meh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cream cheese is kinda odd with raw salmon
N🆗ri (Marisa): tom goin' for the elite weeb connoisseur route
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I'm not about that salmon cream cheese life
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm sure it stands for greatness and took thousands of years to perfect
Andrew: Philly roll is meh
N🆗ri (Marisa): a monk sat unmoving under a waterfall for 20 years to come up with that raw salmon cream cheese
Andrew: Although I'll eat anything with salmon
Andrew: I need to go out for sushi more often
N🆗ri (Marisa): for u
Andrew: Oishii sou
Andrew: I don't have jap keyboard rn
Andrew: Imagine I wrote that in kanji
