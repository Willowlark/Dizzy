N🆗ri (Marisa): Look what BoJo gave me
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: is that a *stack* of PBA cards?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg she gave u the powa
N🆗ri (Marisa): These combined with the “honorary junior officer” sticker I got last year will make me unstoppable 
No they’re stickers
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You're gonna use these Everytime we drink
Bill: ~~Marisa cosplay Sun or Neptune when~~
Bill: ~~Marisa best Junior detective~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I am jess that is exactly what I thought of immediately when I got them
N🆗ri (Marisa): Someone on insta has a really awesome officer Jenny cosplay in the works
バナナ: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Opinions: is it really worth going through my 100+ galleries and tagging them so I can make filters for 'rwby galleries' or what not?
Bill: Or if you need that do I just kick you to Flickr to search
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t think it’s really necessary. If someone wants to find their pictures it’s easy to scroll until you see them
Bill: Cosplay Photography has like, 20 pages though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Scroll until you find them or die trying
Bill: anyone else?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No
Bill: no opinion or no don't bother?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I wouldn't bother
Bill: It'd be nice but... so much effort and so little site traffic.
Bill: Done deal, it off the todo list.
Bill: Had a dream my parents were putting Leanna up in Katy’s bedroom cause leanna was like... between apartments or something. Like they just did it, in this reality I already moved out to an apartment. 

Also I was going to do “bath Ren” photos with Tom on my lunch break somehow. But that was just Ren dumped in the water.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what a kawaii morning
Bill: Have you been outside.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no
N🆗ri (Marisa): never
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmaoo
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had a daydream it was katsucon and I pulled open the curtains going “What a kawaii morning” and everything was on fire
N🆗ri (Marisa): The sun itself has graced Katsu
Bill: https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/us/air-traffic-controller-shortage-faa/index.html?ofs=fbia
N🆗ri (Marisa): An hour long delay isn’t bad
N🆗ri (Marisa): People need to get paid tho. I heard most staff in Hawaii’s airport are starting to permanently quit
N🆗ri (Marisa): Even if they get backpay that won’t help ‘em pay bills now
N🆗ri (Marisa): *oh no jess is red*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh yea, I muted BNE for now cuz the rent discussing was blooping alot and distracting me and I had work I gotta get done today.
Bill: you have message notifications on for everything? <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: I only get desktop notifications for DMs and mentions.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😬 yea
N🆗ri (Marisa): *jess*
Bill: same for mobile.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m afraid to type more because it’ll bloop and notify you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It ok don't worry about it
Bill: She won't get notification bloops with DnD on.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I closed my broswer anyway
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm just... Not 100% right now
Bill: 💕
N🆗ri (Marisa): s u m m o n i n g g o o d f e e l s
Bill: how you do that?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sometimes the summon takes a while. spell cool down and all that. It’ll happen tho dw
Bill: I only know how to summon Ashley.
N🆗ri (Marisa): If you have the spell in your quick menu just select a target and hit c
Bill: oh shit you right.
N🆗ri (Marisa): You can add a skill to your quick menu by hittin G and dragging it
N🆗ri (Marisa): Let’s gooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): When lewd Minecraft chicken cosplay appear on my insta feed I delete the app. Goodbye Instagram.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Gov. Reopen for 3 weeks
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh awesome
Bill: Commission came back real fast!
Bill: ~~Sherwood’s bow doesn’t have a string tho~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yoooo that’s really cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): すごい
Bill: Ye. ~~85 bucks~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): AWESOME!
Dirty Lego (Tom): Lmao just erase the string
N🆗ri (Marisa): I honestly thought it was actual game art for some new title
Bill: Ye, I can do that.
Bill: The guys a popular artist.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~see if he’ll finish the aurii dating game sprites~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did he say there was a long turnaround time?
Bill: Nope. I’m just amazed you can do art that good so quickly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): A tru pro
Bill: ~~the bio does have about the bowstring, but I definitely don’t want to comment on it.~~ there’s the part of me that’s “I’m a client, I paid for the work, so it should be correct” but also the larger part that knows better than to tell an artist *I* of all people know better. 

It looks like he did minimal detailing for it anyway. More an accent piece.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo that's pretty nice
Bill: I like. Almost want to do an update of Sona to get both of my precious children drawn.
Bill: But Sona’s outfit choice needed work *before* and I don’t have a hope of figuring it now.
Bill: Sigh.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Just take Sona s outfit from LeAgUe
Bill: ~~wassat~~
Bill: Her full name is Sona Aurelia (they both mean gold) and There’s a MTG angel with both those names. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

N🆗ri (Marisa): i have so much gunk on my hands it's a wonder the keyboard isn't messed up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): How's your con crunch mawisa?
N🆗ri (Marisa): mmm. after the third try i got the hoop skirt to an acceptable point. gotta add the waistband and boning channels now and it's good to go.
i'm doing katarina's hairpiece now too and i don't have a paintbrush so it's super tricky because everything is very tiny and needs careful painting. rip.
i've been meaning to get working on the boots. the bottoms just need to be spray painted but i can make the cloth part.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how bout u
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yay hoop! 
Ahhhh no progress since the weekend
