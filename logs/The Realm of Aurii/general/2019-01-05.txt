Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): I‚Äôve taught my classmates so much I‚Äôm so proud
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): YESSSS
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): She take
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): oh no now jess won't be able to see who stole her glasses
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It is a mystery <(0_0)>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i was wonderin why jess hadnt added to the tea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its cause a smol thief took her sight
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): YUSH
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Honestly, goals
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): OH MY GOD
Bill: How do I resize a selection in photoshop. I'm trying to make the rectangle square.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): there's a tool for that, where you can resize it freely. can't remember what it's called
or look in the select menu
Bill: I wanted to get it perfectly square.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): the menu will have an option you can use to put in the exact height and width
or if you just want to de-select and select it again hold shift while selecting
Bill: ~~nevermind it looks terrible squared off~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _is anyone here good at writing_
Bill: This server started for a play by post rp.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _is anyone here good at writing and likes to offer their opinions_
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): not good at writing. can offer opinion. :3c
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ok so im writing my first post for my physics blog
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and its essentially "why it matters that we listen to college age physics students"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): it turns out that the data suggests that creativity peaks in the early 20s
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): https://docs.google.com/document/d/14rHNb5Q_27om9toM8OfQWkVdv4nA46c_iE6sue44i90/edit
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): heres what i got so far
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and i need like one last paragraph to write a conclusion
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I like writing but doesn't mean I'm any good <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): opinions are appreciated irregardless <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): so i want to conclude by saying that we should listen to college students because they offer unique perspectives on information that the more learned individuals may not see
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but idk how do that
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): why is "liberal arts" in quotes
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It's exactly the reason of what your writing about why people tend to lean more conservative as they get older on average
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): cause i quoted it from da article
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah! cause they become more dogmatic
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and dont wanna hear what anyone else has to say
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i gotta do my MLA formatted sources, thatll be last
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): "such a leonardo"
you missed an s! careful!
ye dont forget the sources for "liberal arts" and "specialized"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): o no where the "s"
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): o i see
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): So you have your evidence already hmm just a wrap up couple sentences then
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i think it's good
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah basically my argument is that the most scientific progress can be made when creative young people work in conjunction with experience and learned older people
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i like that the reader doesn't need to know much about physics, all the background info is pretty self-contained in the paper
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah! thats why its a good first blog post
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): also if any internship recruiters actually look at my website its a subtle nudge for them to recruit me ahaaaaa
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): whats the opposite of a student but not a teacher lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah v nice üëå
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Sorry I don't have any input other then what you have is good <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): thank you, i appreciate validation nonetheless üòé
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): opposite of a student but not a teacher? :0
like a uhhhh mentor?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Conclusion just needs a thesis repeat and maybe little extra tidbits and stuff, although it's not exactly a paper
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): an academic? is that too formal of a word
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i think students are also academics
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _professional_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its a professor but not quite
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): this is a good warm up for aurii in remembering how to make words sound good together lol
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): professor is the evolved form of professional
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): it's nice trying to give feedback on something written by a native speaker
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): very refreshing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): truuu you havent done that in 5ever have you
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): how weird that must feel
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): good job with collocations and conjugations ‚≠ê
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And coagulations
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): sometimes esl students write really well, but something is just a little off about how it sounds
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): here's a chunk of something i was grading recently
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): it's really good, just a few mishaps here and there
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): at least relatively speaking. sometimes sentences are just entirely nonsensical and impossible to understand even when written by advanced students.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeah and it just doesnt quite sound natural
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like "The goal that may be achieved"
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): yeah!! it's weird trying to teach people that something is grammatically correct but never used
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): "you made a good sentence, it follows all the rules. but we don't speak like this."
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah that'd be odd from the outside in
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): when your blog goes live post it so we can give it lots of views
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): o yes of course üôå
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i gotta think about what the second post will be on
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i should probably break down a physics concept
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): or i could do a review of some of the physics books ive read
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): video game physics pls
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): i had to write a blog for one of my classes over the summer and i just went off on the sims for one of my articles
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): after seeing spiderman again i wondered if i should run the physics to see how strong his webs actually are
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): that was an interesting idea
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and ive already talked with the physics and math guys on how to calculate the probability that someone survives the thanos snap
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): do it do it
if people can publish papers on the thermoydnamics of anime girl chests you can totally publish that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): yeee this physics blog is basically for fun
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): while ill put it on my resume to show a demonstrated interest in the field
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): its mostly so i can dick around with whatever physics concept i want to
Bill: People have done super hero physics before.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That sounds like something out of game/film theory
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): combine the nerdy and physics interests muahaha
Bill: Trying to decide on if I want to change Sherwood's hairstyle in his reboot redesign.... Used to have longer hair, short braid coming down to his shoulders, red highlights in blond hair.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): https://www.wired.com/2014/04/the-physics-of-spider-mans-webs/
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _its been done_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tho id be curious to see this for myself too
Bill: *what did I just say*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _i know thats why i googled it_
Bill: CPAC had a panel from one of their professors, they did more than just that.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ye they talk about whether or not its actually faster to swing or run
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): answer: usain bolt has a top speed of ~12 meters per second
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): spiderman has an (unoptimized) 14 meter per second speed while swinging
Bill: FUCKITTY stupid printer is ignoring my setting print margins to 0.
Bill: Ilurrgghhhh
Bill: APPARENTLY if I use the printer wireless I can't get it to work.
