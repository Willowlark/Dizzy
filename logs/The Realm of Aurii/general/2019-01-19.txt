N🆗ri (Marisa): I overfilled this mold so i popped it out and it looks nice ;u;
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Shiny!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye! i was gonna spray a high gloss top coat over them but i think they're fine as-is
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't get the serger to work though. bojo is looking at it now but also can't figure out the problem, and i can't move on with any sewing until we get a working serger. <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): AAA noooo why do you need the serger? Thick fabric
N🆗ri (Marisa): thick fabric and i don't want the hem to look messy. everything's gotta be clean, even if it can't be seen <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> they always roll the hems up

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): WE GOT MY BABY COUSIN AND HER DAD THOSE
Bill: It’s never a good thing when I nap...
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Yo I took a nap too
Bill: FInally reading boudoir stuff... Apparently studios... have their own outfits... for you to wear? That's... odd.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea! I've heard that
Bill: I dunno if you have an idea of what you're doing (I assumed pink and green because lol) but another thought. ~~Or would Nora just add pink to wedding outfits anyway~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): My outfit is a bridal one u can use the tiny veil and stuff
N🆗ri (Marisa): Boudoir day is Thursday of Katsu ya?
Bill: ye.
Bill: Ooooh ya'll ain't going to like some of these tips.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm not sure show naked I'm getting sooo
Bill: That's... mildly relevant. There's less to worry about posing wise the more clothed you are.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I know just haven't had time to think about it yet
Bill: thas fine.
Bill: The research is still applicable to bathing suits.
Bill: Somewhat. Bathing suits are same amount of skin, just less *spicy*.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean I have 1 pink bra
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I want sure if I was gonna get down to undies it just like less cloths
Bill: I will have *absolutely* no opinion on this, best friend married to my other best friend.
Bill: You do what you're comfortable with, I'm doing the research to be prepped for whatever though I'll take prior notice if you got it.
Bill: Mawisa isn't doing anything super lewd either so.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I gotta think about it, look at options, I'm assuming you don't wanna see my tiities
Bill: *probably for the best isn't it*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean I won't even waste time considering it if you think it's uncomfortable
Bill: I mean, we were never talking nudes anyway?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I didn't think so but like idk 😂
Bill: Ye that'd be a hard no.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 👌
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No titty
Bill: Pantsu is like, basically swimwear so I figure it whatever.
Bill: We've already done swimsuits.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): JESS I GOT A FREE UNDIES COUPON FROM VICTORIA SECRET they doin the free undies promo
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So if you need any for boudoir hit that place UP
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): So like bra and undies or lingerie are ok? Just no tiddy out?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sorry I'm not sure what pantsu means really
Bill: Tis weeb for underwear.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oOoooO send me dat coupon cuz I need good thong for mina
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But does it mean just underwear? Or bra nad underwear
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cuz I thought it was just underwear
Bill: Usually just underwear.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Bill you’re confusing the heck outta me too and I thought I had a good grip on undies
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But then toddies would be ok <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: 
Bill: Don't get naked. Simple.
Bill: Do you really *want* that anyway, I know I'm your awkward third wheel but like?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm just gonna go with whatever a bathing suit would cover
Bill: That would be not naked yes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IDK I don't know if you even see me as a real female™️
Bill: I'm aware you are female yes.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Female™️
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Female™️ Jess™️
Bill: And I do know what you mean by that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): O WAIT MARISAS doin it too
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Wow what a partay
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): A half nekkid party
Dirty Lego (Tom): Wooo
Bill: tldr no sexy bits. *That goes for Tomu too*
Dirty Lego (Tom): I won't whip it out I promise
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Damn
Dirty Lego (Tom): I hope Jess has ideas cuz I have none 🙏
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I have some? Ish?
Bill: The only thing you need to decide is what kinda face Ren got in the bedroom. He can't be emotionless there.
Bill: ~~so you know, whose on top~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~both~~
Bill: I am seeing a trend in couple boudoir where it's a little more 'mid undress', so having an 'outfit' might be neet. I wouldn't say the cosplay proper, but something in the character's look while still simplistic.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that's kinda what I was thinking?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Like a progression
Bill: Yeah, I agree. That's sexier and more romantic than just INSTANT UNDERWEAR.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea that's what I was thinking
Bill: Ren's like... an underarmor type shirt that's tight to him, jeans, and maybe one of them arm bands.
Bill: ~~definitely not blake's fucking socks~~
Bill: ~~unless Nora into that kinda thing~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea I have a few ideas I gotta just like flesh them out more
Bill: tldr I enjoy seeing my best friends in love, just don't *over* do it for my poor, romantically starved soul. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No tiddy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I prob will need a drink or two to do this
Bill: ~~one of these articles recommended champaigne~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Cool I have two mini bottles of prosecco
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Left iver from my bachelorette party
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Also i will technically have my wedding dress and veil on me
