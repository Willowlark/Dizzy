Bill: Okay the RWBY episode was 15 minutes and I still haven‚Äôt gotten my food 10 minutes later they clearly lost my food.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): At least it‚Äôs not a 2 hour wait in an empty Denny‚Äôs
Andrew: Well today sucked, wished i calle dout and went to Kotori
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Now would be such a good time for lasagna
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): What happened at the store Andru
Bill: > Expects Marisa to be around in the morning due to time difference
> Marisa is stateside
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): I keep checking discord while shifting the time back 14 hours
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 8am now so discord must be 6pm. Wait.‚Äù
Bill: that's what the timecheck command was for in the first place!

Bill: *prays by dabbing*
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): I left sooner after a dude trapped me in the arcade room and asked about my whole life eyyy
He didn‚Äôt ask general questions but specific stuff like ‚Äúwhere do you go to school?‚Äù and stuff like that so he assumed I was probably younger. BoJo called and I escaped. Maybe the guy was lonely he told me a lot about dig down.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Hazel cosplayer also invited me to a panel but I declined
Bill: OOF I'm sowwy Mawisa.
Bill: I would have stayed if you wanted me to!
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Nooo is ok!! You would have got stuck in snow and you were hungry. I don‚Äôt consider them creepy, just the video game guy a bit socially awkward

Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): You could make a documentary based on wildlife observers. But the wildlife is cosplayers before a con.
Bill: That would... be amusing, to be fair.
Bill: Nah, I'mma work on photos, copy my shoot trello to a notebook (I just can't commit to one way of organizing my ideas), maybe look up the boudoir techniques I keep saying I'm going to do.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ‚ÄúThis female has collapsed after sewing gathers in ribbon for 13 hours. The male beside her will soon succumb to exhaustion, as he has similarly been exerting himself over minute finger armor. Look how they cut the foam into a billion tiny pieces and re-glue it together. Exquisite.‚Äù
