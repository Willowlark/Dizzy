Aldus Larian (Jess): I had a dream that <@!351785752197201920> and I were doing some competition thing? and it involved picking teams. He was a team leader and he didn't pick me at all so i ended up getting picked last on some other team and i was really upset about it so i was like "why didn't you pick me to be on your team?" and he was like "because i actually want to win" and i was the big sad

Bill: I gave up and don't care though.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): did you get a new bed?
Bill: Nah, just a headboard for the queen I got end of last year.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've been looking for a new frame and potentially headboard on Wayfair and I've been reading reviews because a few people have mentioned some of the frames don't line up with standard headboards/vice versa

Nokri (Marisa): like 90% of news outlets get stuff from reddit. buzzfeed and lifehacker are basically all reddit and tumblr
Nokri (Marisa): reddit's one of the biggest websites on the internet it's not really obscure
Nokri (Marisa): 19th most popular website on the entire internet this month <:pew:543202259085950996>

Aldus Larian (Jess): We were born in a financially tumoultous time plus every two years someone was screaming "the workds gonna end". We were told to go to college but now the markets over fled, so now most of us are in debt with no jobs or underpaid ðŸŽ‰
Aldus Larian (Jess): And that's just the beginning!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Holy duck itâ€™s raining BAD here
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think itâ€™s coming off that tropical storm Puerto Rico is getting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The thunder sounds like itâ€™s just overhead
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And you can even hear a real sharp crack before the boom
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's the best thunder
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So my mom was running around for a bit because she couldn't find her keys and I was going to suggest getting a Tile (or maybe that would be a good Christmas gift?) And then I remembered it's a piece of technology that involves GPS so the government might be able to track them down ðŸ™„
Bill: Uhhhh
Bill: I donâ€™t think so. They work over Bluetooth primarily.
Bill: Yeah itâ€™s all Bluetooth.
Bill: Any map locations it provides are via your phone.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Well yeah, but I figure with it being a locator, gps would be involved from the app
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Idk. Regardless, they'd probably think it was a Big Brother type gizmo
Bill: Oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah the app uses GPS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~like just about any other app does~~
Bill: Yeah. You could disable gps permissions on the app and just use the Bluetooth connection to find stuff. Which is where I find them silly, theyâ€™re really short range.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 300 feet
Bill: I should do something. I started watching archer two hours ago and havenâ€™t moved since.
