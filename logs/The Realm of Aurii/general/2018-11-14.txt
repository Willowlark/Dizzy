No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah it sucks. if he complains anything smells i'm gonna be like 'yeah, that's probably the sink. you see, i haven't been able to wash my dishes in five days.'
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Oof yeah
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): I mean it true
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Dishes get dtinl
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yee. even if you rinse them, the water is too cold to murder any bacteria
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Yeah üò± if I don't clean out the strainer every day the kitchen smells like garbage üòî
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Anyways good plan
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i tried taking cold showers for 2 days, just couldn't do it. the water was way too cold even after trying to get my feet used to the temperature for like 25 minutes. so I've been heating pans of boiling water and can make due with about 8 panfulls of water dumped into the tub and mixed with a bit of cold water
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): but it'll be nice to stop doing that
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Yeah that's a good idea
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): I was trying to.think.of ways to cope
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Hats not bad
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): PANFULLS OOF
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Not even pots?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah I don't have a pot <:lenny:395307171539189760>
it's just me so whenever I make soup or ramen or something a pan works fine and i have a bunch of leftovers
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): üò±
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Buying you a pot to use for Japan ....when you get back...
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): ..hmm
Bill: I'm editing my story template, with my logo...
Bill: In doing so I accidentally created a shadowed effect that looks awesome?
Bill: Oh I did it again.
Bill: *is this what being Jess is like?*
Bill: 
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): wow so professional
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i want my high school friend to know when i'm online so i'm gonna try to set my status to online but i'm gonna put it on busy and see how long it takes borrach to message me hhhh
Bill: BLOCK HIM
Bill: FOR ***FUCKS*** SKAE
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): *but we have so many mutual friends and servers and i can't block him on every website*
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i shoulda've set a timer
Bill: I DO NOT CARE.
Bill: DON'T LET HIM HARASS YOU ON ANYTHING YOU CAN PREVENT IT ON.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): when a person is offline does it say when they're typing?
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Yes
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): cool because that's too OP otherwise
Bill: Jogging while pushing a stroller amuses me.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 45 mins if the day we're just my boss "updating us" I have no idea what he said I zoned out the whole time but I wasn't late so that's all that matters
Bill: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2y97i4b3y6dot4o/AACaBVHGbdgg73mSOI2V7p8Ua?dl=0
Bill: Thoughts?
Bill: Namely on the filtered versions of each.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i like number 6
Bill: And if anyone has an idea besides putting the seal in the corner for netting more space on the card, share away. I thought about centering it and making it kinda translucent, but it looked dumb.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): put it in people's pupils
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lower left hand corner is popular, water marked like you said or no logo, tect only
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): boss impliend i was the onlt one who started her that allrady knew what i was doing and didnt need training <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah plain text along the middle top or bottom is popular
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): pro jess
Bill: I don‚Äôt like text only tho.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it definitely does distract
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im just saying its another way of maximizing space
Bill: Yeah.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): actually it depends on how you do it. the ones i got last year that had text blends in really well and is barely noticable
Bill: Marisa, this isn‚Äôt for putting on photos. I use these templates on my stories when I just want to say something without a particular image.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oooooooooooooooooooooooo
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i knew that
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): totes
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): same
Bill: Like when I do question replies.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): omg you're so famous
Bill: ~~even though I only get asks from you Mawisa~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): but you're so famous how come there aren't 50 billion questoins
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i always wanna do those things but im scared
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the question stuff? do itttt
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i want to do more but i know no one will ask owo
Bill: Cause I don‚Äôt actually have fans, I have mutuals and people who think following me means they might meet Georgia.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ~~staring at the people in bne who i asked questions to and they didn't ask back smh~~
Bill: Oof. That odd though, people are usually good about them.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): really? :0 i sent the assumption thing to around 5 people and none wrote back ~~but they all saw it <:lenny:395307171539189760>~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i wanna be friends with bne but i feel they're wary of me
Bill: The assumption one is weird.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): is that your assumption <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): That's odd cuz they all seem to like you
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Maybe once they all see you in person again
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): lenny but the squint lenny
Bill: What a loving and affectionate BURN.
Bill: ~~I know cause I did it and no one cared~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): what did you burn should we call a fire truck
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i'm gonna look for more story games <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i feel like making asumption is rude so i don wanna do it even if im asked
Bill: Tom burned you when pointed out everyone likes you.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's wednesday which means it's opposite day according to spongebob which means i am hated
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): spongebob law
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): finding good insta story games is like panning for gold in california
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): well CA on fire so yea that would be hard
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the guy coming to check the hot water tomorrow probably won't ask to use the bathroom, right.
so i can put my giant trash bags full of trash in the bathroom, right.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): it's kind of rude to use a client's bathroom right
Bill: yes.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): SWEET i'm shoving everything in the bathroom
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): the non-shower bathroom
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): toilet room
Bill: If Deviantart updates its UI, it a sign of the end of times?
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i x'd out of spotify and the music didn't stop aaa
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Ahhhh
Bill: So I'm going to go to the swiss army store after this call... Then I wanted to go get some ginger liquor that's only available in the city... But I might not make the 6pm train to be home for dinner.
Bill: I don't feel like eating alone in the city, but I wanna do all the things.
Bill: Well. I rushed and ended up in Brooklyn.
Bill: So this going well.
Bill: I couldn‚Äôt decide between two... now maybe I‚Äôll let my parents get the second one for me for Christmas (they have trouble know what to buy) so I can use this one.
Bill: If you thought my knife was overkill before.
Bill: I got my knife and I got the ginger liquor. Yeet indeed.
