Bill: I love the *smell* of a heavy rain storm.
Bill: So I have no idea where to put the new computer.
Bill: I can fit it on my desk, but then I have no where to put the printer.
Nokri (Marisa): put on top of printer
Bill: Fuck it's about half an inch too tall for where I want it.
Nokri (Marisa): time to get a saw
Bill: this one inch is ruining my organization.
Nokri (Marisa): saw! it! off!
Bill: how much effort do I want to put into wiring the webcam behind the corner of the desk...
Nokri (Marisa): ask the nsa
Bill: unf.
Bill: I didn't think of something SUPER important.
Bill: What to name this computer.
Bill: A2?
Nokri (Marisa): well first what gender are you assigning the computer
Nokri (Marisa): if it has one
Nokri (Marisa): man. are there any gender neutral titles?
Nokri (Marisa): Comrade
Bill: I feel like I've watched something with a character that has a black blue color scheme...
Nokri (Marisa): blue exorcist?
Nokri (Marisa): black rock shooter?
Bill: oof if BRS wasn't such a long name.
Nokri (Marisa): oh are we going for short names. that's sad.
Bill: More one word.
Nokri (Marisa): how about paraphernalia
Nokri (Marisa): bezel
Nokri (Marisa): fipple
Bill: I just thought it was Black Heart from Neptunia, but she doesn't have blue accents.
Nokri (Marisa): fake nerd
Nokri (Marisa): name your computer The Decoy™
Nokri (Marisa): if you get searched by interpol it'll confuse them
Bill: Shit I need this name.
Nokri (Marisa): bunpersnarf
Nokri (Marisa): consult a ouji board, safely.
Bill: ~~I'mma just name it Bowsette and kill myself~~
Nokri (Marisa): https://g.redditmedia.com/CxHcgqzLoOG9my6bnzwDn_QNHBpOt6kR3a4Cx4_e1q4.gif?w=320&s=014e976411a9df892c17282c5b68fe96

Nokri (Marisa): Georgia is too smol that is illegal
Aldus (Jess): I just saw that! I wanna try it. Georgia wouldn't like it though 😂
Nokri (Marisa): You can’t just drink alcohol
Bill: Watch me.
Nokri (Marisa): The police shall do just that
Bill: ~~I'd probably hate that though, I'm not a porter beer person~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~More for me~~
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): Delete that
Nokri (Marisa): Alcohol dulls your senses and thins your blood. if you drink it in a wintery wonderland you *will* die and your body will be hauled off to jail.
Nokri (Marisa): Santa jail
Bill: Santa jail sounds fun.
Bill: Can eat your way out.
Nokri (Marisa): I’ve eaten a cup of ice that I paid $16 for and let me tell you. Eating ice sucks.
Nokri (Marisa): In Santa jail your tongue freezes to the bars
Bill: We have finally put a clock on people's morning updates.
Bill: Literally have a shared screen on the conference call, with a timer running for a minute.
Nokri (Marisa): Speedrun
Nokri (Marisa): Try to get through in a half A press
Elfriede (Tom): Sorry about the sadness :/ if it makes you feel any better I'm super anxious for my wisdom teeth consultation <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede (Tom): Even though I know it's just gonna be "..Yep those need to be pulled alright!"
Afina (Georgia): ye tom youll be okay!
Afina (Georgia): they stole my teeth last november
Afina (Georgia): wow that was a year ago
Afina (Georgia): actually they didnt even steal, they like, stole them and then returned them to me
Dave: 🍹
Bill: The dentist was just protecting them from those rotten skittles.
Elfriede (Tom): Ooof
Elfriede (Tom): It shouldn't be that bad tbh, they are all all the way in
Nokri (Marisa): If you get them pulled make sure jess films you on anesthetic in case you say anything funny
Nokri (Marisa): Good blackmail material
Elfriede (Tom): I wasn't sure if I wanted to be put out or not yet 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): ねー。
if i'm ever annoying, posting too much, my gags grate on your nerves, my words are distasteful, or anything, it's ok to tell me straight up. i would appreciate it if i'm ever a nuisance. sorry for any trouble. even if my sorries are bothersome then sorry.
<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Hush you are never a bother Marisa.
Bill: The only thing you could POSSIBLE do to annoy us is stay in Japan any longer than you have to.
Nokri (Marisa): [stays in japan longer to buy limited edition weeb goods]
Aldus (Jess): Everything you do is a blessing and you make my day a little brighter every day ♥️
Nokri (Marisa): u are confusing me for a mirror
Nokri (Marisa): or a really reflective window
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Nokri (Marisa): u ever stare at yourself in a tinted window and then realize there are people on the other side. whoops.
Aldus (Jess): Yea 😭
Bill: WOW that line was gay Marisa.
Bill: Jess too.
Bill: This is all really gay.
Bill: ❤
Nokri (Marisa): people existing on the other sides of windows is homosexual
🌈
Bill: Sometimes.
Elfriede (Tom): 🌈
Dave: 🇧 🇪 🇭 🇦 🇵 🇵 🇾

Aldus (Jess): noooo 😭
Aldus (Jess): EXCUSE ME GOOGLE I HAVE AN EMERGENCY
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH GET OVER HERE, YOU CAN COME TO TDC WITH ME AND COSPLAY
Nokri (Marisa): we can do karaoke and uhhh touristy stuff idk
Bill: What's bothering you Marisa?
Nokri (Marisa): i'm gonna try for karaoke tomorrow if i can get myself to leave the house
Nokri (Marisa): that sounds like a line from a film noir

Elfriede (Tom): FR SH A VOCA DO
Nokri (Marisa): the new otome game no hametsu flag books come out later this month. can't wait to see how they draw katarina's skirt differently again.
Nokri (Marisa): everyone on twitter is really mad the emergency alert woke up them hehe
Nokri (Marisa): sorry i scared everyone away in bne and made the chat off topic
Bill: Stop you.
Bill: and better it be a false alarm than an actual quake.
Nokri (Marisa): during actual quakes we don't get alarms lol. every time the big emergency alerts get sent out nothing happens, but we don't get any alerts when something does do a shaky shake
Bill: That's weird. Are you like, set for the wrong region?
Nokri (Marisa): biru alfort biscuits are delicious
Nokri (Marisa): naw it's just nearly impossible to detect quakes
Bill: Oh yeah they were good.
Bill: I have another flavor too.
Bill: ~~random japanese chocolate eating is great~~
Aldus (Jess): OOO speaking of at 2:18 today they are testing some new national emergency alert system so our phones might freak tf out
Nokri (Marisa): ooo that's a weirdly specific time
Aldus (Jess): yea right
Bill: My Mom needs to buy another car already... get the Mercedes or buy another rogue if every car feels like a rogue but just because I work from home doesn’t mean I like sharing my car.
Aldus (Jess): why dont they just get a lease for now?
Bill: Because nothing suits the need. And she doesn’t “need” a car but that’s becoming more and more bullshit.
Bill: It’s as first world as it gets I know.
Aldus (Jess): if they got a short lease then she could keep looking for the car she really wants bt still have something to get around in
Bill: Or rent something.
Aldus (Jess): thats what a lease is essentially
Bill: not quite.
Bill: I get it, I mean, I want her to get to physical therapy as much as anyone else. But she called me while I was getting lunch 'you are coming back right, Dad's got his appointment and I was supposed to get a haircut' and it annoys me that there wasn't even a mention they wanted to borrow it today.
Bill: Don't assume.
Bill: I get waiting on a car. When Dad couldn't drive, made sense. Mom works from home, she didn't need a car too much, yeah, okay. Now she's got physical therapy 3 times a week, bible study (which Dad usually comes home too late to pick her up from), errands, going to see Kurtis's Mom, doctors, like...
Bill: You need a car.
Bill: You can't plan on when I'm in the city or working from home and use mine.
Bill: I'm annoyed right now, but I'll talk to them tonight. I'm not letting this go too far.
Aldus (Jess): if you live in this county and ever leave the house for anything, you need a car
Bill: exactly.
Bill: and we aren't sit at home people.
Bill: None of us.
Aldus (Jess): and if she "didnt need a car" then she wouldnt be looking at cars at all
Bill: that's in reference to waiting for the right car.
Bill: Which I do understand. Hell, it was my suggestion to get a *luxury* car. Me and Katy are self sufficient now, they're free.
Bill: and every time someone else drives the thing the seat has to be adjusted, and the sweet spot a big guy like me is comfortable in the car is *small* and hard to find. It takes forever to readjust and until I do I spend my 2 hour drive to Armonk quite uncomfortably.
Bill: Ugh, I know this is as first world as it gets.
Aldus (Jess): I mean it makes sense that you want your car to yourself
Bill: I mean, whenever I have a problem like this I always think about how my problem is something people *live* with. You and Tom shared a car for years. And it's not even a major issue, like Kurtis's AC-less Tank.
Aldus (Jess): my dad took my car out twice when we were camping and my mom got irritated because he just "assumed" he could take it and didn't ask. Of course I didnt mind but if it was constant, yea id get annoyed
Bill: they don't assume all the time though. They ask and apologize they have to.
Aldus (Jess): ~~also one time my dad took my brothers car out and rear ended someone so my mom doesnt really want him driving anyone elses car even though it was an accident~~
Bill: Any of you listen to Jim Jefferies? Comedian?
Aldus (Jess): na
Bill: He's an angry Australian. He's hilarious, but deffffinitely not family friends.
Bill: ~~and in NY in November~~
Bill: ~~ye he a dick but~~
Aldus (Jess): every drawing i do looks like a completely different style <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): fridays prompt is chicken? etf
Bill: fuck.
Bill: My photo back up process died.
Bill: Halfway through.
Bill: ~~I need the damn wire to my room~~
