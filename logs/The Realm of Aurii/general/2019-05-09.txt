Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Have boarded
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like as soon as we reach cruising altitude, we're going to begin descending lol
Bill: It’s such a short distance you might be right lol
Bill: Oh so. Y’all know how I never write a help command when I work on Dizzy?
Bill: To upgrade the API I had to ensure every command was working.
Bill: So I ran them all in an admin only channel.
Bill: Jess is still admin.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): :O
Bill: You were so close to knowing every command!
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/JbVqZOn.jpg
Bill: 🔞lewd
Bill: Looolol that’s still there.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good thing I just about never use dizzy, and forget she exists most if the time
Bill: ~~I’m going to have to implement the help command eventually I’m starting to forget which commands are on which server~~
Dizzy: hidoi yo!
Bill: !ghost hidoi yo!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ticket says 45 minute flight but all my flights so far have been early so I'm betting about half and hour
Bill: Don't jinx that my guy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If any flight goes wrong, it's going to be this one
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I shouldn't say "goes wrong"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"becomes inconvenient"*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There we go
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had a nosebleed in the airport earlier so hoping the pressure doesn't open that back up mid flight
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
are you dying
N🆗ri (Marisa): also @ that picture above
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/072/328/926.gif
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Airplane mode time
Andrew: Just as good a second time
N🆗ri (Marisa): furry jess
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Das me!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thank Mawisa! <:pwease:555585508819075112>
N🆗ri (Marisa): bark at the sadness to drive it away
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good advice
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Very cute!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 18 and a half minutes from takeoff to touchdown
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Took longer to get from the gate to the runway because of other planes ahead of us lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wtf all the assholes in the back started coming up before the front
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But yeah they said it's American Airline's shortest flight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Not sure if that's actually true or if the pilot was being sarcastic
Bill: Wild dreams. Sussex tech was like, three periods a day or something, run super weird, you had to go through a like, one foot high corridor to math class, then I woke up and told everyone about it. 

Then I had to find the correct place to use a lighter in NYC. Like some kind of puzzle. Which rather than being from a small set of buildings I could mouse cursor over, I was in. Then the building I started into had a plane crash jnto it, I dodged the wing, met an ex digidestined, half the city flooded, rode around on a seadramon, found a clue as to “where the lighter is supposed to be used” got a cool embodiment of Weiss power up... but couldn’t get my partner digimon back and it was a bad time.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaoo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I want some apple pie yo
Bill: how American
Bill: Man, Tom got noticed by C2 artist sensei, Jess getting noticed by what little following I have on instagram, Erik getting noticed by zonbi...
Bill: *such impressive friends I have*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I've gotten 15 likes on that and almost all of them have c.c. profile pictures
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Which is impressive cuz I didn't tag it and have no followers
Bill: what platform?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Twitter
Bill: Oh wow.
Bill: Famoose.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I didn't get a nosebleed on the plane but I woke up at 4am with one
Bill: It’s your psychic powers awakening.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Miraculously didn't get any blood on my bed
Aldus Larian (Jess): "remembers lunch*
*forgets breakfast*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Mawisa how I dwaw fast and clean and coow wike youw?
Bill: Would also like to know this.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:mood:543191222127296522>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mawisa senpai pwease teach us <:mew_face:498866691963355137>
Bill: Well that was an hour and a half to confirm VSC isn't working.
Bill: I should make vectors again.
Bill: I wasn’t bad at that.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Good idea!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Really I need to get better at digital art I think
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So easy to fix lines
Bill: Ooo. I could vector my own photos.
Bill: It’d be harder than anime stuff but.
Bill: Might look cool.
Bill: You just gotta do it.
Bill: Why not find a 30 day challenge for art, and make sure you do it every day? No more than... 30 minutes, and it doesn’t have to be perfect, it’s just to DO. Like a warm up.
Bill: An artist I follow keeps posting to patreon “warmup” sketches. Simple, no color, just warmup.
Bill: That’s the idea I’m going for.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can’t draw
However Erik are these nosebleeds normal? Have you gotten them before or have you gone to a doctor for them because regular nosebleeds aren’t normal and could be a sign of something very wrong
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont do well with those kinda of things id rather work on a piece for 30 mins a day then hace to do a new piece everyday
Aldus Larian (Jess): nosebleeds are prob from flying
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz when i rush to get one piece done 30 mins im never happy with it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Changes of the season can do it too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I used to be nosebleed prone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The nurse in middle school pulled up my file and was like “why have you been here 8 times for nosebleeds and nothing else”
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm getting to a point where I can almost do something in 30 minues
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Like that lol looking San was 30 minutes
Bill: I don't get how to take a long time on a drawing.
Bill: Like, I draw it and say 'oh okay I guess I'm done with this eye'.
Bill: I dunno how to like, iteratively improve.
N🆗ri (Marisa): For newer artists, don’t time yourself, it’s better to continually work on a piece  over a long time than “I need to finish this in 2 hours” because you might train yourself to draw quickly but you won’t be improving, you’ll just be reinforcing your current drawing style and any flaws it has. 

Timed drawing is good if you’re confident in your ability and need to reinforce your muscle memory/test what you can do in a short amount of time. It’s not good if you’re looking to draw something totally new because you don’t know how to draw that yet
Bill: So Wise.
N🆗ri (Marisa): In my art classes at Rowan which were 3 hours long each, they’d have us draw/paint one thing per class or sometimes one thing over multiple classes
Bill: I was only thinking about it so you don't like, *obsess* over one image forever. To me that sounds dangerous.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s why you take breaks while arting
Walk away from it for a few days and then come back and you’ll have a fresh perspective on it
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats exactly it work on something a little bit every day
Aldus Larian (Jess): i want to try to draw more but i get discouraged extremely easily
N🆗ri (Marisa): draw draw draw draw
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I get nosebleeds quite a bit. Probably a result of chronic nosepicking. Sometimes it bleeds from picking, sometimes just from blowing my nose.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Would like to get cauterization done at some point
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But that would require going to a doctor
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's fine
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll live
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oki as long as you’re not suffering from like. A botched lobotomy or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): Like Rosemary Kennedy
N🆗ri (Marisa): That’s a fun hole to go down if you want to get lost on Wikipedia for a while
Bill: I prefer Tvtropes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): iiiiiiiiiiii went to go buy bojo a mother's day present i was saving up for and there are charges on my card for the iTunes store that I didn't use. so that money is gone and someone's using my card information <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: OOF
Bill: Call the card company.
Bill: They'll usually wave any fraudulent charges.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yup we're doing that now. this happened last year too, it happens to us really frequently.
however, it takes a few days to go through so i won't have the money in time. i'll need an alternate solution
N🆗ri (Marisa): solution=present
N🆗ri (Marisa): We have to shut the card down again 😿
Bill: whyy?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Because it’s being used by someone who isn’t me?
Bill: They can't issue you a new card? And I'm assuming it's not credit right, so you should be able to change the pin?
N🆗ri (Marisa): They can issue me a new card that’s what they’re doing. It takes several days though
You don’t enter your pin for online purchases
Bill: okay, I thought they were saying "just don't use it ever again".
N🆗ri (Marisa): The call disconnected while still in the middle and I can’t call back, it just gives me nothing on the other end. 
And I noticed our kitchen ceiling is leaking again. Good day
N🆗ri (Marisa): the kitchen ceiling leaking is a sign of the toilet leaking through the floor <:pew:543202259085950996>
not the hole in the floor, that's a few inches over. it just soaks through the bathroom floor and into the kitchen ceiling. magic.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Have a meeting about the second apartment today <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yay! good luck!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): thank!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~scope out dat pool 👀 ~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I forgot that I wouldn't have to use the scary highway to get to and from because it's literally off the main road from my work, but down a ways
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): pool would be v nice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't know what typical apartment rules are concerning guests but it'd be neat if I *did* end up there if y'all came to pool and picnic or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooomg there is some spicy drama in the YouTube Streamer world right now
omg
apparently ProJared cheated on his wife with Holly? and basically this happened on twitter
N🆗ri (Marisa): but holly is married to ross from game grumps??? i used to watch holly and ross's streams a lot they were so cute this is WHACK
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Whoaaaa what
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): holly and ross broke up like a few months ago
N🆗ri (Marisa): REALLY???
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): holly started sleeping with jared
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): jared is married
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): his wife found out
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and went on a tirade all over twitter
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): big yikes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Where can I find these tweets
N🆗ri (Marisa): o m g
i feel so bad for ross. i used to really like holly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i only saw this screenshot
N🆗ri (Marisa): i got to "speak" with ross during his livestream once, he answered some questions i had in the chat and actually had really thoughtful answers so since he acknowledged my existence i basically stan him for life
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ahhh
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I don't know know them but ahhhh
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have no ide who these peopl are
Aldus Larian (Jess): but yea
Bill: Yeah I'm more confused than appalled.
N🆗ri (Marisa): from skimming over news articles, it seems that ProJared decided to get divorced with his wife because he was caught sleeping with Holly. he denied these accusations but the wife had proof, so he made that tweet above and holly pretty much admitted everything by posting that "sorry, i'm here 4 u" tweet. fans called her out on it and she responded "this doesn't involve u so mind ur own business"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Awww game grumps Ross? I didn’t watch game grumps but roman always fell asleep to it and I saw their comedy routine once
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): will he even be single tho... seems like hes just gonna jump right in with holly >.>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): truuu oh nooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 🍿
Bill: 1. Why have like half of you not replied to the damn list for Laser Tag.
2. Hunter marked +1 betcha I know who.
N🆗ri (Marisa): who? :0 that snow person?
Bill: ye.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): pls dont bring snow
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh woah fireball mountain is actually only an hour away from me? or is it further
if it's an hour away i might be able to go
Bill: We may be able to pick you up.
N🆗ri (Marisa): this place?
N🆗ri (Marisa): that would add 4 hours to your commute
Bill: yeah and also yes oof, I thought it was by Rowan.
Bill: Though since *apparently the 15 original confirmed isn't happening* we can give Andrew/Jen/Jeremy the info.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh cuz o muted BNE
Bill: Even @everyone's?
Aldus Larian (Jess): And I tried to load the channel before and it didn't load and I have up
Bill: lolol
N🆗ri (Marisa): is opposite direction from rowan <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): is this a cosplay event or just laser tag?
Bill: Jen lives in glassboro, if she's interested she'll give you a lift no problem.
N🆗ri (Marisa): stranger danger <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881>
Bill: Not cosplay. Unless you'll use that as an excuse to skip, then it's cosplay.
Bill: ~~I already put a 100 dollar deposit down on it so if half the group bails I'mma be pissed~~
Bill: It shouldn't matter, I don't think I'll be paying more, but it's the principle of the thing.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's already 10 confirmed though right? how many were in originally?
Bill: 7 outta like 15 from BNE.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I JUST EXPLODED RIBBON EVERYWEHERE
Bill: I guess I should take my son advice and stop planning things at the BNE level.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I THINK I GOT THEM ALL BUT I CANT REMEMBER HOW MANY I HAD TO BEGIN WITH
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): itssss not that i think its just that laser tag isnt pallitable to everyone
Elfriede Faun (Tom): AHHH
Bill: I’m basing of the people who marked it before.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): also i cant go because work
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if you wanna make sure youre recording people who cant go and not just thinking they havent answered, you may wanna put a ❌ option on the poll
Bill: That’s news. Understandable.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i may be able to go but i have to check my schedule
N🆗ri (Marisa): i thought it was too far away
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): on account of nasa not getting back to me yet, despite the positions still being open, the current plan is to finish out the saturdays of being a receptionist and transition to being a salesperson
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and if nasa gets back to me two days before the project starts i have the ability to drop all previous plans and rearrange stuff
Bill: Commission on sale and you’ll have more money than you’ll know what to do with too.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah you get 100 dollars flat for every car you sell, thats without factoring in GM incentives and store incentives
Bill: I thought it was like, 1000.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no
Bill: Rip.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it gets to BE around there but flat fees are 100 irregardless of the car
Bill: So bar NASA plan is to have Saturday’s free cause of the transition?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it makes sure salespeople dont get screwed over selling a car with fewer incentives
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): saturdays not free, salespeople work saturdays
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): with ample warning i can maneuver around
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so cons and stuff are ok
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but itll be basically what i do now plus working during the week
Bill: Yeah I figured. Well, the money is better.
Bill: You worked during the week last year didn’t you?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah if all goes well i might not even need to work next semester
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): doing hourly work yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and not every day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and ill have rocket club on some sundays
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): which is flexible because the project leader things im cool and its not every snday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA SALES! you're gonna be soo good at that. Good luck!
N🆗ri (Marisa): you gotta take pictures as this meme
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"This pickup truck can fit so much cosplay in it!"*
N🆗ri (Marisa): o no i won't be able to go to fireball mountain sowwy
Bill: Sounds like a good plan.
YOU BAKA: i'm gonna get paid $96 to attend a lifeguard training course that weekend <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>  but i don't know if i'll be able to complete that at that time aaaaaaa
Bill: You can do it!
YOU BAKA: WOW RUDE
Bill: Be the free boi you are inside!
YOU BAKA: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
YOU BAKA: no like i can totally pass the course but maybe not that weekend
YOU BAKA: now my name just insults everyone on the server <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Glonk: Why was there a notification for this channel, I don't see my name highlighted in a message
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Bill @'d everyone and then edited it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was wondering that too
Bill: I fucked up yeah, I thought the apostrophe would prevent the everyone from triggering.
Bill: God I wish I could wear headphones around my neck. As is they just. Rest under my chin flab and make me look heavier.
Bill: You home with Bojo Mawisa?
Bill: She good?
Nokri (Marisa): she's home but she keeps driving places and taking the support off her foot <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: Oof.
Bill: Good you’re home.
Bill: I think imma get revenge on you.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Revenge?
Bill: D
Bill: O
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO DON'T
Bill: M
Bill: I
Bill: N
Bill: O
Bill: S
Aldus Larian (Jess): She hates that <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: That’s the pointtttttt
Nokri (Marisa): DONT DO IT bojo spent all day when she was home making food
Bill: It’s REVENGE.
Aldus Larian (Jess): For what?!
Aldus Larian (Jess): For having an injured mother?
Bill: MAWISA thinks I DIDNT want to shoot Katarina at KATSUCON.
Nokri (Marisa): i think you never want to shoot anything with me <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: SEE
Nokri (Marisa): that's the garbage person i am <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: SHE NEEDS TO BE PUNISHED
Bill: (WITH LOVE AND AFFECTION BUT)
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's not her fault sometimes you just don't seem excited to shoot
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wow look at that pic of marisa
Nokri (Marisa): me coming to clean biru's clock
Bill: I literally DRAGGED her to the balcony to SHOOT it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): In her defense you did say "I don't want to shoot anything I don't know" like 2 weeks before katsu
Bill: *I read Katarina!!!!*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh opps
Bill: **On Marisa’s recommendation!**
Bill: There’s no excuse!
Nokri (Marisa): we originally planned to shoot downstairs so i dragged biru downstairs first but there weren't any good spots <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well marisa has a complex that it will bother you ~~lol so do I~~
Nokri (Marisa): wait i'm being summoned but i'll come back to nag when i can
Bill: Hi yes yes I’m working on my *obvious preferences* in photography but when I say LETS GO SHOOT it’s not because I DONT WANT TO.
Bill: I want to shoot ALL THE TIME, not at cons. Why would I not.
Bill: Ugh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Because u seem tired at cons
Bill: Duh it’s a con. It literally bothers me when things go unshot.
Bill: Ugh. I love you both but you FrUsTrAtE mE.
Bill: I need to go drive and pick up my camera.
Aldus Larian (Jess): But but
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thats a completly logical reason why we would think that
Bill: Simple solution, NEVER ASSUME my opinion! Ask!
Bill: ~~I’m totally going to pretend I look tired and people don’t want to bother me is why I have rep as Georgia’s photographer now tho~~
Bill: Jk jk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): GOOD MEETING WITH APARTMENT MAN
Aldus Larian (Jess): At kogara i mentioed getting pics of tom in the computer room thing and you were like "good luck getting me to stand up"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He set the bar VERY high

Aldus Larian (Jess): Hows the pool 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They just refinished it, getting it ready for the summer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But he said it's usually never crowded
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And there are two charcoal grills available to use in the courtyard area outside
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awww yeee! Amd utilities included? Did u tour the avtual apartment?
Glonk: How many monies

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): wow thats awesome
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Trash, recycling, and sewage
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's amazing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He said average electric bill could be around $30/mo in the winter and maybe double in the summer because of the A/C
Aldus Larian (Jess): Electric nwont be much ours is like $70 ish a month for a whole house
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA

Aldus Larian (Jess): THATS AWESOME
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Cat rent is $10/cat/mo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): After $250 deposit
Aldus Larian (Jess): Not bad at all
Bill: God that sounds great. 1 bedroom?

Bill: Oh.
Bill: That’s pretty smol.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Has balcony tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lots of ~~cosplay~~ closet space
Aldus Larian (Jess): Not smol for a one bedroom it's like half the size of my house
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did u take any pics 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): No ._.
Bill: Katy’s apartment is 8 or 900 is all.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But the pics online accurately represent the apartment
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rent?
Aldus Larian (Jess): *grabby hands*
Bill: Not sure.
Nokri (Marisa): That’s about the same size as our house <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): You can stand on your balcony in fancy attire and act all mysterious
Nokri (Marisa): **two cats**
Nokri (Marisa): My apartment in japan was 193 square feet and a bunch of prospectives I looked at were even smaller 🏠
Bill: 1300 for 950, I don’t believe it’s all inclusive either.
Nokri (Marisa): Utilities included is great
Nokri (Marisa): 950sqft is a mansion
Bill: Apparently 30 bucks for utilities and pay for your own cable/internet.
Bill: So that’s not too much more for more space.
Bill: Someone stop me I’m looking at camera backpacks again and that’s 250 bucks or something to buy.
Bill: YALL
Nokri (Marisa): us
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): US
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🇺🇲
Bill: *Im looking a 300 dollar bag as an impulse buy damnit stop me*
Aldus Larian (Jess): How tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): (do)n't do (it)
Nokri (Marisa): with $300 you could buy like 5 water bottles at a movie theater
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's a quarter of one month's rent if you're lucky
Aldus Larian (Jess): What channel were we talking about the gamers cheating in?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My sister said I should get the apartment
Bill: I made it out!
Bill: Whew.
Bill: The straps weren’t comfy.
Nokri (Marisa): a sign from the universe
Bill: If anyone needs gift ideas for me, I need to get another capture plate/clip for my camera... want a set for the Ziess so MAYBE I’ll use it.
Bill: And they’re stupid expensive for what they are.
Bill: ~~still it keeps my camera secure so I shouldn’t bitch~~
Bill: And I don’t need a damn neck strap.
Bill: But man I’ve already filled the backpack with gear and it’s like. Annoying to get at cause it’s on the two sides. I kinda want a back opening backpack so I can get at it all easily.
Bill: ~~or I could carry less stuff~~
Bill: Also Jess I was snarky about Seven shoot at Kogara cause 1. feet hurt, 2. Stressed about Georgia changing her plans, 3. end of day, 4. snarky, but most importantly 5. I thought you wanted like, one picture, not a shoot. Sorry.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's fine. That's just the type of interactions that make me feel like I'm bothering you
Bill: I’ll tell you if you areeee
Bill: ~~wouldn’t you. Always feel like your bothering me then~~
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah!! That’s it!! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Nokri (Marisa): The seven shoot she was trying to do at kogara was early in the day, before we shot outside
Bill: She’s talking about the computers in the evening.
Bill: You don’t count Marisa, you think we should all hate you by default.
Bill: Which YOU can think. It’s wrong, but as long as you don’t try to tell me I have to hate you, I’ll respect it.
Bill: If I hated you in reality you’d have been canned from Katsu just like Scott.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well I kinda do think thay
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I feel like unless we plan something formally ahead and it's like really scrict then I'm just being annoying
Bill: OH you meant with the photos not. I seem like I’m bothered by you LITERALLY all the time.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no
Bill: Haha phew. That was a uh. Scary thought.
Nokri (Marisa): Is it ok to invite Dave and swolfy and Rebecca and Anna and such
Is that a nuisance to them
Bill: DONOT
Nokri (Marisa): ok I won’t
Bill: That was a weird typo my@bad.
Nokri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was gonna say...
Elfriede Faun (Tom): DO IT THEYLL COME IN A HEART BEAT
