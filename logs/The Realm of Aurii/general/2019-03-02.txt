N🆗ri (Marisa): isn’t it neat how a lot of people light their kitchens on fire every day

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh my college bookstore had them in the clearance bin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You could get like a pack of 10 for $0.25
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It was a bargain
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Our campus radio station also had a huge stack of blank floppies stored away in a cabinet because they used to actually be useful
N🆗ri (Marisa): Imagine all the secrets they held :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): And all the towers you could build :0
