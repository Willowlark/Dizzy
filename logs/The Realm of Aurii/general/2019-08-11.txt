Nokri (Marisa): wow our families should get together
my pregnant cousin got asked to pose with her boyfriend at their baby shower and she was like "ugh, i hate you" and then they were all romance and smiles, and then afterwards she threatened to hit him. he went and roamed around with their first kid for a while and then when it came time for presents she said "i don't want you to sit next to me, find somewhere else" real seriously but everyone laughed it off like "haha! typical lovey dovey couple stuff!"
Nokri (Marisa): they've been together for years so there must be some romance there? but honestly he just seems abused by her every time i see him
