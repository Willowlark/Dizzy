Áßã„ÅÆÊ†ó„ÅØÁæéÂë≥„ÅÑ„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ(Marisa): I got lost for an hour with a dead phone, I recognized everywhere but I didn‚Äôt know where it all was in relation to my hotel until I got to the store I had walked back from yesterday and made my way from there. 
A cat crossed the street and followed me for like 3 minutes which was nice but the rest of the time was terrifying.
Áßã„ÅÆÊ†ó„ÅØÁæéÂë≥„ÅÑ„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ(Marisa): I could‚Äôve walked into any conbini and asked for help finding a landmark but I didn‚Äôt want to inconvenience the clerks.
Áßã„ÅÆÊ†ó„ÅØÁæéÂë≥„ÅÑ„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ(Marisa): I want to tell Georgia to prioritize her health above all things but that‚Äôs easier said than done. 
You can always tell people ‚Äúwatch yourself‚Äù but then push your body to its limits because it‚Äôs just a mortal flesh wound. You‚Äôre fine. 
Like that time I passed out at Rowan‚Äôs haunted student center just because I was really into my Halloween role.
Bill: There is something in my shoe that‚Äôs kinda sharp and the stupid train is packed so I can‚Äôt get it out.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I got one of those "you have been hacked" emails at work and im lauging my ass off
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao
Bill: I *just* have the 10:30 meeting scheduled for today and I have NO more meetings until the new year!
Bill: They cancelled the daily meetings the rest of the week.
Bill: I officially told COPRA I'm moving projects...
Bill: I'm basically fucking done for the year already.
Bill: I'mma bullshit my way through the rest of the week doing 'training'.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ughh i really wish i had off next week üò≠
Bill: I'm feeling more starbucks after this call.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): No flu <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): they think it‚Äôs more likely than not bronchitis
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sounds about right
Bill: That‚Äôs not good either.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I believe it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): did u get da antibiotics?
Bill: Monday, Japneet: "will everyone be coming in wednesday?"
Everyone but Vincent: "yeah, last day before holidays"
Me: "okay, I guess I'll come in"

Today, Jing: "Sick, taking a half day from home"
Today, Gord and Japneet: "Have interviews, won't be around for lunch"
Today, Vincent: *In Armonk*

Why the *hell* am I in NYC.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I GOT DA DRUGS
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I have taken the first dose and now I rest
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHOO
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Wooooo
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): HURRAY FOR DRUGS
Bill: Last night I said to myself if the dock that lets you detach the cable from it (so you can keep the phone plugged in while using it, then easy dock again) I bought a month ago goes on sale again, I'd buy it.
Bill: It's on sale again today.
Bill: *ditto on the switch pro controller*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so buy them
Bill: ~~at some point I acknowledge I spend a lot of money~~
Bill: Pro controller on *sale* is 56.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so dont buy it?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you seem to like to and seem to have enough money to spend whenever you want,  so like if you want me too encourage money saving, youll have to let me know lol
Bill: I just worry my definition of 'cheap' is getting skewed.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): how much is it normally?
Bill: 70. 56 is the best price I've ever seen for a pro controller.
Bill: but I also don't... really need one?
Bill: Like, I want the second one so I can dedicate one to my PC and one to my Switch.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): that was the next question
Bill: I'm just being lazy (and expecting bluetooth pairing issues) to not repair the same controller.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if you dont need it then dont buy it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if it has an actual issue, contact the company, see if theyll send you a replacement
Bill: Tho, if I'm doing any split screen smash gaming (or towerfall, which supports 6 players on switch!) It's a good buy.
Bill: I just assume by doing anything, even something supported, outside the basic 'use with switch' i'll eventually freak the hell out.
Bill: ~~I assume that with all electronics, the more you use it the higher the likelyhood it'll explode~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so you want 2 because 1, pairing it with 2 things it a pain. and 2. multiplayer?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if you are going to actually use it then get it, but remember that you arnt "saving $14" you are spending $56. what about the other thing you wanna buy?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh and thats not to undermine the practice of waiting for things to go on sale, cuz obviously still the smart thing to do if you are doing to but the thing anyway
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~also im prob not the best person to ask cuz i have a stage 9 freak out every time i make "selfish purchase"~~
Bill: *All* my purchases are selfish!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: ~~that's still sad~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it was sarcastic lol. if you are still saving money then you are generally fine, just understand the lifestlye change that may occur when you move out
Bill: mood.
Bill: But yes, that's the idea. Be in the green every month.
Bill: https://www.amazon.com/NieR-Automata-World-Guide-1/dp/150671031X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1545244425&sr=1-1&keywords=nier+automata Yeah I'm buying the FUCK out of this.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): id say with your situation of you arent in the  well intro  the green every month, its time to adjust
Bill: God I hope they release multiple lore books.
