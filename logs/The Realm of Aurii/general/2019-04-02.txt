Bill: My phone crashed in Starbucks cause “battery could not meet peak performance”
Bill: I’ve been looking for an excuse to upgrade for months.
Bill: Like. Literally said 'maybe I should take the subway this morning instead of the ferry, cause I can walk past the apple store and look at phones'.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If anyone needs patterning paper, let me know. I've got like 5 rolls of scrap paper that are like 7 feet long by 22 inches wide
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:spongebobcaveman:562661849297059881>
Bill: Am I going to go buy a new phone over lunch?
Tikur (Kurtis): Yes
Bill: you know it.
Bill: backed up photos, everything else is cloud based.
Bill: I have reason to keep this phone but I feel like I should for some reason.
Bill: I can trade it in for a discount...
Bill: I’m not about the larger screen sizes so I’d have to choose XS which is the last one in terms of battery life.... =/
Bill: Do you get used to JUMBO phones or...
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea
Aldus Larian (Jess): plus your a guy so theres actual room for them in your pockets
Bill: I dunno I just feel like it’s not worth it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): what do u want more, small phone or longer battery life?
Bill: Who knows how long the battery life really will be anyway?
Bill: At a minimum it’ll be better than my 3 generation old phone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well yea but the base life is still the base life if u like a smaller phone that much that get the xs
Aldus Larian (Jess): i went from the iphone 4s tot he 6 and at first it felt insane but now i pick up one that size and im like D:
Aldus Larian (Jess): then i went bigger with my phone now, same thing but you get used to it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): large boi
Bill: How am I supposed to use it one handed though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ho big is it?
Bill: 6.5
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): mines 5.5 so i cant say
Aldus Larian (Jess): hehe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): i use mine one handed but its a stretch
Aldus Larian (Jess): the xs is even bigger than my phone
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoops
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Yeaaaah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): mine's 6.2
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): but the iphone is longer right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): not as wide as some other phones?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mines 5.5
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which iphone Bill
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If you censor the word phone from this conversation it’s hilarious
Aldus Larian (Jess): your going instore anyway so just pic which ever feels best if you dont care about better life
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “then i went bigger with my [censor] now, same thing but you get used to it”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sorry I’m actually 12
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): based on 6.5 screen size I'm assuming Xs Max
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Which is slightly shorter yet slightly wider than my phone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but bigger screen
Aldus Larian (Jess): the XS is def plenty big enough esspecially if u wanna be able to use it one handed
Aldus Larian (Jess): you have so many other devices so its not like you are using only your phone like many people do
Bill: XS
Bill: Yeah, I’d watch videos on my tethered iPad.
Bill: I want it to be useable so yeah, XS.
Bill: Also <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea alot of people like bigger phones because it is their only device, they dont have tablets, laptops, or desktops so the phone is everything
Bill: Phatablets.
Bill: The Georgia’s of the world. 😈
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I has big phone, two tablets (one I don't use anymore), and a laptop 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i mean i wasnt saying its the ONLY reason someone would want one, but it is a reason they are popular
Bill: So much for quick.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also I'd totally take a roll eric
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh yea, my svage sponge was me saying im also interested in the paper
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): okie doke I'll bring to next gathering
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I measured them out and wrote out the dimensions
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OMG WHY
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also how did you measure length
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rather than doing actual work I started doing some spring cleaning so I'm finally going through my massive pile of obsolete drawings and finding some rolls of blank scraps
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Measuring tape
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Dimensions are in inches btw lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I used to shred this stuff but it got to be too much so now I'm folding everything up to stick in a bin my boss takes every so often to burn
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is what I've managed so far
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is what I've got left 😩
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And yes that box says "Shit to Shred"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ohh okay inches
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That makes sense
Bill: Got it. Phone only works on WiFi.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): After discussion of messy desks it got me in a cleaning mood. I need to bring in my Swiffer and do the floor. It's so gross
Bill: I now have a headache and just want my lunch. It is busier than at noon in the Wendy’s too.
Bill: Gotta setup the phone before I get going later too.
Bill: Man apple has made this process streamlined. It got account information from my phone by holding them near each other, and is using a backup to install shit.
Bill: I've done *nothing* for work all day.
Bill: Which is.
Bill: Liberating.
Bill: But also bad for when I need to fill out a time sheet.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > *went to Apple Store for work-related expenses*
Bill: Not technically.
Bill: My company does pay for my phone bill (they don't provide a landline, so we're available to clients via our cells), but getting a new phone is grey area. ~~I'm going to try since I did it due to 'my phone, which clients contact me on (via slack anyway), was malfunctioning'.~~
Bill: it's not going to fly, but I can ask Japneet (HR) later, during the social, maybe after the first round of drinksssss....
Bill: ~~I low key don't want to go to the social though~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh I got mail at my school address
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s never good cause if I order things I order it to home
Bill: *Census Bureau*
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe family sent u something?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL ITS A COUPON FOR A FREE POPCORN AT THE RUTGERS MOVIE THEATER
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Aight that’s cool I’ll take it
Aldus Larian (Jess): YAY! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ah, the old university spam mail
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): except it's actually good
Aldus Larian (Jess): were u afraid someone doxxed u?
Bill: More likely afraid of an internship rejection.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooooooo yea that would make sense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): my mind went to dox too lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but that would take an awful amount of work to find out where she goes to school and what her box number is
Bill: If anything she'd get home doxxed. Hell, we don't know her dorm address.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye that's why i photoshopped the geek week off of her phone. people be freaky.
Aldus Larian (Jess): good thinking mawisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm irrationally angry over an april fool's day prank now
N🆗ri (Marisa): *it's april 2nd you can't be spreadin' that stuff*

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I just had to dox myself
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe mailing stuff will work better in the same country now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Now I have a coupon for endgame popcorn lol

N🆗ri (Marisa): my top post is a really shaky video i posted 2 years ago but it gets at least 5 notes every day, according to the notes people use it to stim? so i'm glad it comes in handy for them

N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: I was able to fill 6 hours of a timesheet without bullshit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have no idea how to view tags XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's an x-kit extension i think, and then there's a little icon of a shopping tag or something on the bottom of the posts next to reblog
N🆗ri (Marisa): in that screenshot there it's the icon left of the arrow
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH yea that must be xkit
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I request clarification on the stim usage
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Both because I'm ignorant and unsure
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~me too~~
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also what your recording was
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think it means like asmr?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think stimming is stuff autistic people do to calm down. like fiddling their fingers, tapping things, humming. fidget spinners and fidget cubes are stim tools
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah that's one of the things I r3ad
N🆗ri (Marisa): http://princessvanellopevonschweetz.tumblr.com/post/149425097887/i-did-and-bought-a-lot-of-cool-tourist-y-stuff-but

N🆗ri (Marisa): are you saying the $5 headphones aren't the good ones
Aldus Larian (Jess): No the $80 ones are <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
