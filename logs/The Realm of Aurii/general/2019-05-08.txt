Afina Tyndall (Georgia): woo!

Bill: As opposed to when you stand up and *every bone in your spine cracks*?
Bill: That was terrifying man.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That too
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's it like in the past
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's still normal time
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): EXCUSE ME
NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): The AF discord is not as nuts as I thought it would be, everyone just sounds defeated
N🆗ri (Marisa): I was so looking forward to it this year 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There's a beautiful service dog boarding our flight
N🆗ri (Marisa): i got messaged by 3 different ex co-workers in japan who are all equally mourning as they spread the news
artemis fowl was really popular in our workplace
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have boarded the time machine
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): it may be timey wimey but i hope it's not wibbily wobbly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same
Glonk: make sure you have a working flux capacitor
N🆗ri (Marisa): don't mind the tally marks on your arms they're fine
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ||our plane is fueled by Pym Particles||
N🆗ri (Marisa): quick i need a recent dark and edgy movie that wasn't a box office failure to prove a stupid point to my associates
N🆗ri (Marisa): the aggretsuko christmas special perfect
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uhhhhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Empty seat again! :O
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Airplane mode I go
Bill: I miss my cameraaaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): write it a letter
N🆗ri (Marisa): i appear to have lost half of a dress <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): like...cut in half?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it's in pieces and i can't find the back parts <:thinku:543194478614413318>

N🆗ri (Marisa): i found it <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> under my piilow
N🆗ri (Marisa): human heads are so disgusting that's like the worst place for a pillow
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's just taking a nap
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Successfully landed in the past
N🆗ri (Marisa): we're a day ahead of you haha
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoooo!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Both my flights today went smoothly. Didn't have anyone next to me and both landed earlier than expected
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That means tomorrow's flights will be hell
Glonk: you must believe that the flights will be the same
Elfriede Faun (Tom): God hopefully I
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Made it to hotel. Dumpy little Days Inn in like a back alley
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I forgot I booked a suite because it was cheap and there's so much space
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So that hotel was a trip. The internet on their guest computers wasn't working so I had to log into my email on the front desk computer to print out my boarding passes...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Obviously I logged out and removed my account from it, but like... O.o
Aldus Larian (Jess): nice!
N🆗ri (Marisa): they let you use the front desk computers? <:minathink:544567715931750405>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Was going to see if they did luggage holding so I don't have to carry my bag all day but I did not trust that hotel with my bag lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She just turned the monitor and gave me the keyboard and mouse
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds like the hotel would hold your luggage by just keeping it in the lobby next to the front desk
N🆗ri (Marisa): most of them do that
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wow lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think someone else asked and it sounded like they were going to hold it in a locker in the gym
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But still... didn't want to have to Lyft bank yo my back alley hotel
Bill: oh. Uh.
Bill: you might have a problem.
Bill: https://splinternews.com/dont-cross-the-line-1834606709
Bill: <@!386874959009415170>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye was gonna say they're on strike
the app still works but there might be a lack of drivers
gonna have to find a taxi
N🆗ri (Marisa): they app is actually encouraging people to use it today to counteract the strike, it's messed up
Aldus Larian (Jess): sounds about right
Bill: Ask the front desk (if you're still there) if there's a taxi company nearby they recommend.
Bill: Probably not, given their level of incompetence but.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I already lyfted today 🤷 hopefully I can get one back to the airport
N🆗ri (Marisa): hotel doesn't sound incompetent, just unstaffed or low budget
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Already checked out of the hotel
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Have aquired mango juice with spicy grape juice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Totally not champagne 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This expo is actually kind of neat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Your badge has a barcode so when you talk to exhibitors, they can scan your barcode to easily get your contact info
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's freaky
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye! lots of shows have that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I shifted things around in my bag and now I have a Croc digging into my back
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hope you've watched bear grylls then
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): LMAO I'm eating lunch right now and there are two guys here and the one was telling us how shitfaced he got last night and he lost his phone so he's calling their boss with his colleague's phone to give him an update on things and he told his boss he dropped his phone in the toilet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omfg
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): trade shows, man
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theyre pretty lit if you go alone without your boss LMAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): how's the cosplay?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Have you seen any mimosa cosplays
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Only lit if you go without your boss for multiple days
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't really feel like attempting to do the MillerCoors tour
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ^ true, multiple days are important for them to be lit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Checking into your hotel at midnight and checking out at 8:30 the next morning doesn't make for much of a trip
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i went to one in atlantic city with jon last year without my boss and they had the tropicana hotel booked up and the pool had a free bar and karaoke ....also a steak dinner
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that was pretty lit, ngl
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nice
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but ever since then my boss has insisted on going <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because he, too, wants the free bar.... but then i feel weird drinking in front of him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): why? :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont really know, but its just ... strange
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i have like one beer at the work Christmas party every year and im like  <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): bosses at companies in japan will force their workers to go drinking with them at least a couple of times a month if not every week
Bill: Oh I made my own starbucks drink and it good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): plz no
Bill: Extra creamy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): the plz no was for drinking will boss not fur coffee
Bill: oh ye. I figured.
N🆗ri (Marisa): japan has a massive drinking culture it's scary
but drinking with your boss is ok. drinking with teachers is ok.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *i saw matsumura sensei drinking*
Bill: The only problem is. This is a small cup. and making more is effort.
N🆗ri (Marisa): small is fancy. lift up your pinky.
N🆗ri (Marisa): fruits basket is making me want to do onigiri roulette
is that a fun party idea
N🆗ri (Marisa): not like the cookie roulette but just. onigiri with random stuff in them.
chocolate, a pickle, a cookie, a chicken nugget, cheese
N🆗ri (Marisa): *a smaller onigiri*
N🆗ri (Marisa): egg, cake, potato, corn
N🆗ri (Marisa): i might do that. the menu has to have weeby stuff on it because graduating from japan school. but sushi is tough to make an expensive to order while onigiri is easy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Update: the colleague of the dude who lost his phone is gay (had a feeling because he had the voice™) and asked me "where can we find the hot girls with the prize wheels?" And the straight hungover one says "yeah he's trying to hook me up. They're not for him" and the gay one goes "yesh I just wanna suck a dick"
Bill: Don't stress the party! -Yoosung
Be sure to invite a cat -707
I'll handle everything -Jumin
Aldus Larian (Jess): holy SHIT
N🆗ri (Marisa): parties require a lot of planning and the planning is the fun part
it's the party part that sucks
Bill: Seeing us is going to suck? 😏
N🆗ri (Marisa): no but save yourselves the long drive <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I *just* complained about seven telling me what to do in a video game, what makes you think you can? 😏
N🆗ri (Marisa): the power of persuasion 🌟
Bill: *You can persuade me to order you a pizza*
Bill: Have you eaten today Marisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no, bojo finally decided to go to the hospital because the pain was too severe and while she was at work a nurse came in and said she might've broken more than her toe
idk if she actually went though because she said she was gonna go buy flip flops
Bill: I hope you drove there.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nooo driving is scary, i said to call my sister, she wanted to drive herself
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's only 2pm it's too early to eat
Aldus Larian (Jess): mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok I've walked around this expo like 3 times and I'm kind of done
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Too early to go to the airport but not enough time to really do anything around the city
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Plus it's cold out and I don't want to be walking around the city in just my black denim jacket
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh noes!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooops have nothing for lunch
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof it's so warm back home
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea it's nice out
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's 44 and rainy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Here
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH NO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It was really weird going from NC to WI
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The temperature difference was insane
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also I had a beer with lunch so now I'm sleepy
Bill: oh mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Uh oh when do u go home.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Flight is at 5ish
N🆗ri (Marisa): o today? woah
N🆗ri (Marisa): better get to the airport now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably gonna leave for the airport around 3
N🆗ri (Marisa): 3pm????
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yes
N🆗ri (Marisa): ???? but your flight is at 5 how are you gonna make it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): With the power of friendship! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): thoughts on this amazon review?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i see no one has problems with ketchup on sushi
you monsters
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I assumed it was some other kind of sushi sauce
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ive never had sushi lmao i didnt know that was weird
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same
N🆗ri (Marisa): soy sauce is technically the only sushi sauce (it's the only stuff they have in sushi restaurants) but technically you're not supposed to use it, or not use a lot of it
N🆗ri (Marisa): you poor souls
N🆗ri (Marisa): sushi party when
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont like fish xD
N🆗ri (Marisa): they have non-fish sushi! i rarely ever eat the fish ones
N🆗ri (Marisa): inarizushi and egg sushi
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean i also dont like eggs... or seaweed.... or veggies >.>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sushi is not up my alley
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): however ill always go for chicken terriyaki
N🆗ri (Marisa): in the us it looks like they have more non-fi oh rip
<:thinku:543194478614413318> 
dessert sushi
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): dessert sushi is a thing?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): fruit roll ups, marshmallows, and gummy bears/gushers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my teeth hurt just looking at that
N🆗ri (Marisa): though there it looks like rice crispies
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but its cute as fuck
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Heading to airport
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***you haven't left yet????***
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): :3c
Andrew: Just finished rewatching code geass
Andrew: Gonna go watch the movie again tonight
N🆗ri (Marisa): weeb
Andrew: Is this news
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh I thought it was like siracha
Andrew: If you are interested you're welcome to join me <@301927856240459777>
Andrew: Thought I'd extend the offer just in case
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~marisa u should go is good~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): wait what happened
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was trying to pass expert level difficulty guren no yumiya
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i have no way to leave the house and no spare money but thank
Bill: Did someone say *MONEY*?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: If Andoru can pick you up I'll spot you money for a ticket!
N🆗ri (Marisa): nooooo that's too expensive
Bill: Cause *you need to get out of the house*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have to be here for when bojo gets back from the hospital
Bill: ~~it's not the first ticket I've spotted someone~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd rather spend money on bills that haven't been paid in 8 months and repairing the deteriorating house <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: That's a good cause. And you choosing to do that is very responsible and I'm proud of you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): not saying i don't wanna hang out with andru tho, andru lets party
Bill: But you also deserve to enjoy life a little and be with friends!
N🆗ri (Marisa): no i don't i don't deserve anything because i am garbage <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: How about I just buy the ticket anyway.
Bill: Yeah good plan.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no
N🆗ri (Marisa): no do not
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can't go
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> which theatre.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i literally can't go it would be a waste of money
N🆗ri (Marisa): i swear to god, i can't pay you back and it's a waste
Bill: First of all a *gift* does not have to be paid back. >.>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't deserve gifts though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Friends deserve gifts from time to time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is one of those times
N🆗ri (Marisa): nooo
bojo just sent me a text literally just now saying she's being released soon
i have to make food for her and find clear a space for her to elevate her foot somewhere
and i have 800 envelopes that need labelling and stuffing so i can get money to cover her new hospital bill
Bill: And if you're going to say you don't deserve it because you're garbage, THAT is an invalid reason. You deserve whatever gifts I see fit to give you, and even more than that because you're a priceless person. I do not believe you are garbage, and therefore you deserve a gift for being the great person you are.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the office pays me to mail out the monthly newsletter that no one reads it's funny i'll send you a picture of it jess will love it
Bill: ~~*What the fuck is with all of the people telling me how to feel about them today*~~
Bill: First Seven now you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): look at this lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Drug free zone”
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): i offered to redesign the newsletter while working to have something to do one day but they declined
Bill: If you ACTUALLY need to be home for Bojo, that is a good reason. If you would like to continue to insist I can't do things for you because you feel you are garbage, I will promptly ignore you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): me @ sylvia
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): At least change the font from Comic Sans
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if i say yes to both
Bill: *I call Bojo to find out the truth*
Bill: I have her number.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Change it to something flashy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like Papyrus
N🆗ri (Marisa): no we need the comic sans because "REPORTING CRIME" is too intimidating otherwise <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): You can tell different people type up the newsletter contents because some paragraphs have the double space before a new sentence and some don't
old vs new fashion
Bill: Are you going to make me Bojo and ask her if she really needs your help so we can bully you into accepting we love you?
Bill: Cause that's a *terribly* awkward conversation ngl but for you I'd do it
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH and the community pool will be open during my party and the pool is like directly outside the building so if people wanna swim at my party they can but if not just know that there may be many strangers in swimsuits walking around outside
N🆗ri (Marisa): no she's at the hospital right now
N🆗ri (Marisa): she's stressed enough because we might lose a lot of money if she can't work on her feet
N🆗ri (Marisa): movies have very little cost-benefit. if i spend money on something it should have more worth.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and it can't be today
N🆗ri (Marisa): or probably this month because we don't have money to do anything
Bill: Okay. It does sound like you want to be home for Bojo legitimately, and not using it as an excuse. The benefit is getting to see a friend and do something together with them, but I understand you being worried about Bojo.
N🆗ri (Marisa): good i was getting ready to crush your eyeballs if you called her
Bill: The small and cute girl says what?*
Bill: You are not scary smol one.
N🆗ri (Marisa): crushing eyes is easy, it requires exactly the same amount of pressure as crushing an empty soda can
Bill: *you aren't tol enough to reach my eyes*
N🆗ri (Marisa): high school prepared me for this
Bill: you cannot defeat me, I am God Bill Defender of Justice, His Snarkiness, The Exalted, Hailing from a Northern Providence, Little High, Little Low.
N🆗ri (Marisa): you did not know grade school me, you haven't seen my relatives. i could shank you and deal some irritating damage even without a weapon <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: *Could you know*
N🆗ri (Marisa): they called me "el diablo gato" in middle school for a reason <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i told that to my master's classmates and they all laughed at me and said it sounds like a big mexican wrestler owo
Andrew: Cinemark somerdale
Bill: Oh yeah I mean, I'd laugh too.
Andrew: 730 showing
Bill: Devil Cat?
Bill: Silly.
Bill: It looks like Marisa actually can't make it with what's going on with Bojo.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's a very layered nickname
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think marisa could fuck someone up if presse
Andrew: It's no problem
Andrew: Just read through
Andrew: I'm at work rn
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh are you having fun
Andrew: Not one bit
Andrew: But I'm up for partying
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds great
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna fight now
Bill: You'll have to get through my four generals before you can even think of challenging me.
Bill: And once you can think of challenging me, my seven ADMIRALS will stop you before you can fight me.
Andrew: Sounds like a challenge
N🆗ri (Marisa): i cut my nails recently but they're still usable
N🆗ri (Marisa): a bit uneven tho because i used scissors
N🆗ri (Marisa): not fabric scissors dont worry
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ah good good
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg does anyone remember that mysterious girlfriend x anime
omg it was so gross
i never saw the anime but the manga was so gross and i assume the anime was too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Never use fabric scissors
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Not even on fabric
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg i looked up the anime it looks **so** disgusting
N🆗ri (Marisa): interesting art style but like. <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: Yeah that was something.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): tom just rips his fabric
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WAIT I VAGUELY REMEMBER
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): with his bare hands
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's like in some repressed memories but I remember
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH YEAH YO
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah because he's swole?
N🆗ri (Marisa): DONT REMEMBER
Aldus Larian (Jess): i cant wait to go home and take my pants off
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's making an X as a warning not to touch this series
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Doesn't she like drool constantly
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/4RfUPvd.gif
N🆗ri (Marisa): !lewd
Bill: weird flex Jess but okay.
Aldus Larian (Jess): these pants are too warm! it hot in this office
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LmAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WOAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): she falls asleep in class and is drooling while she's asleep so her classmate decides to casually taste some of her drool, and it's some kind of magic drool or something because now he needs it to live and if she doesn't give him her drool he's gonna die
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh according to wikipedia maybe he just gets addicted to it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ew what
Aldus Larian (Jess): umm
Elfriede Faun (Tom): OH YEAH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): RIGHT
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I ONLY SAW CLIPS BUT THAT SHOW WAS WACK
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I love the art tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): super nsfw but like the whole anime goes like this
