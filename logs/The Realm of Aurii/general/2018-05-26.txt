Bill: Got brisk lemonade Georgia, made sense with the sale at shop rite. Don’t have to bring your own. Welcome to drink drink too. The rest of us are of age and you don’t have to be the odd one out.
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Maybe we can find something you like. And by we and I mean Jess, I drink “antique dressers”.
Aldus (Jess): ~~tom doesn't drink so she wouldn't be lol~~
Bill: I meant in age, not drinking. 😛
Aldus (Jess): Ye
Aldus (Jess): What have you tried alcohol wise Georgia?
Afina (Georgia🍀): uhhhh a lot
Afina (Georgia🍀): at the wedding i liked the raspberry daiquiri
Afina (Georgia🍀): usually the problem is that most people drink to _feel drunk/tipsy_
Afina (Georgia🍀): but alcohol tastes BLEH
Bill: Well you just said you like the raspberry daiquiri.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean yeah like most alcohol tastes bleh
Afina (Georgia🍀): theres like a sting to drinking it
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i sound like a n00b dont i_
Aldus (Jess): You like Mike's hard? Or can you taste it in there too?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i like mikes hard but yeah alcohol for me is like the lesser of the evils
Afina (Georgia🍀): my assumption is that its an acquired taste ~~pun intended~~
Bill: Everyone has their own tolerance for the strength of booze. No problem with that.
Bill: So you like lemonade and fruit right?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ya!
Aldus (Jess): I mean you don't have to drink
Bill: I’ll crack open the drink book when I get home, maybe there’s something I can mix that’s nice. Though I have the stuff for lemon vodka/brisk iced tea & lemonade, that tastes like Arnold Palmer.
Bill: ~~I’m also tempted to get the stuff for Dad’s college jungle juice, the Pangalaxtic Gargle Blaster”~~
Bill: And Ye, you don’t have to.
Aldus (Jess): Hard iced tea is good.
Bill: Yeah, I had a reds lemonade Brandon left behind, it tastes just like the vodka mix.
Aldus (Jess): Never had that one
Aldus (Jess): I don't taste the alcohol in alot of things
Aldus (Jess): I started with beer
Bill: You don’t?
Bill: I thought you do with bourbon, hence the dresser.
Aldus (Jess): I said in alot of thing snot everything lol
Aldus (Jess): I mean like the not hard liquor stuff
Aldus (Jess): Fruity Mixed drinks, hard cider ice tea and lemonades, spiked Seltzer's, hard sodas
Bill: Oooh, okay, that I understand.
Aldus (Jess): The dress thing is more the wood taste then the actual alcohol
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeee jess sounds like she drinks Da Good Shit™
Aldus (Jess): Lol I mean??? Depends on your definition I guess
Afina (Georgia🍀): fruity stuffs for the most part
Aldus (Jess): I mean on the regular I drink spiked seltzer which is fruity, and wine. If I go out (and I'm not dieting)  I'll just order whatever sounds good. I tend to gravitate toward bitter flavors actually but I like fruity too
Bill: *Makes Georgia a Dixie cocktail, entirely cause of the name*
Bill: Apparently has a licorice and orange taste.
Afina (Georgia🍀): UGH licorice is for old people tongues
Bill: Man, I like licorice.

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: My saving Grace is that people thought that my uncle was my older brother
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: And he's 20years older
Afina (Georgia🍀): wow they say that memory and smell are so strongly connected that you can recognize a lot of smells instantly
Afina (Georgia🍀): i walked past SOME smell in my house and immediately it popped into my head "oh this is what my middle school best friend smelled like"
Bill: I'd question why you know that, but I got in the car once and Jess was like 'you used bath and body works stress hand cream didn't you'.
Aldus (Jess): YEEt
Bill: So I think I'm the weird one for not smelling people.
Aldus (Jess): I have a really sensitive sense of smell
Aldus (Jess): And I also use that lotion and it's really strong when you first out it on
Aldus (Jess): LOL chance of rain dropped to 50% for tomorrow
Bill: ~~I'm taking my excuse to not have to scramble to cook~~
Bill: but if the evening is going to have a high enough chance of clear, I'll get smore stuff if we don't have it already.
Aldus (Jess): 🔥
Afina (Georgia🍀): /show up in swimsuit, there is no pool, instead sits in the bathtub
Bill: Go for it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _billiam no thats social suicide_
Aldus (Jess): *also shows up in bathing suit*
Bill: *social suicide is hanging out with me*
Bill: But ye, Jess would do it too. Not even for the electromagnetism. For the swimsuit.
Aldus (Jess): 🙌🏊‍♀️👙
Bill: What is this strange language.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: They are doing a bathroom boudoir shoot
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~do swimsuits count as boudoir?~~
Bill: Uh...?
Bill: ~~I'd say no but I can't fathom what's different~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🎵 two girls, chilling 5 inches apart in a bathtub cause they comfy in their sexualities 🎵
Bill: reminds me I wanted to ask Zeikani the settings she used for her boudoir(ish) shoot at CPAC.
Bill: considering how popoular boudoir is getting...
Bill: information worth filling away.
Aldus (Jess): I'll chill in the bathtub with you anytime gurl 👌

Nokri (Marisa): 🔥
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just imagined nokri trying to light a fire and it not working so she goes "fudge" but suddenly a bonfire erupts from the pile of logs
Nokri (Marisa): nokri would use full expletives she would shame her whole family with the words that come out of her mouth
Nokri (Marisa): she would use all the curses and then say "dufge" as a last resort and then it would work
Nokri (Marisa): fUDGE
Afina (Georgia🍀): DUFGE
Afina (Georgia🍀): NEW DRECAN INSULT
Nokri (Marisa): ***canon***
Nokri (Marisa): enough to make any good person gasp in shock and horror
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina thinks "dumb" is a curse word so
Afina (Georgia🍀): She's a lost cause
Nokri (Marisa): nokri teaching afina horrifically obscene curse words like "in my country, this is how we say 'have a pleasant day!'"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina uses them on Elfriede
Afina (Georgia🍀): He's like "princess no 😅😅"
Nokri (Marisa): all smiley like "where did you learn these words, princess?"
later is seen sharpening his sword outside of nokri's room

Bill: ~~as opposed to the Labrador variety~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): I wonder how someone gets into the hot dog business
Afina (Georgia🍀): It costs 400 to rent a full cart for 3 hours 🤔
Bill: Wow you’re bored today.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I AM there's no calls and there's the perfect amount of traffic that all the salespeople have a customer and no customers are waiting
Bill:

Eliran (Halim): He only ate 8 hot dogs?

Aldus (Jess): Welp, you have good timing 👌
Afina (Georgia🍀): ONLY 8?
Eliran (Halim): I mean a hot dog is like the equivalent of like 
Maybe a slice of pizza 
So like that's only about 1 pizza 
That's not that much
Eliran (Halim): Especially since I'm guessing it wasn't all at once
Aldus (Jess): Eating a whole pizza is a feat for the average person
Eliran (Halim): And you don't have to deal with the diminishing quality of pizza as time makes it cold and not as good
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just watched a man complain about his stomach and then get his sixth chili dog
