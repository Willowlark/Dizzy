Tikur (Kurtis): Quote from a book I love that I wanna share with y'all "Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken."
Tikur (Kurtis): It's from Dune by Frank Herbert.
Nokri (Marisa): that a nice quote thank ye
Nokri (Marisa): i reread flowers from algernon last night and it makes me wanna draw
it's supposed to be really profound but i think it's truly a product of its time. not that it doesn't still apply to modern times, but it's not as profound anymore
Nokri (Marisa): Oh maybe the book is better? Has anyone here read the book version instead of the short story
Bill: Wow I *really* wanna go home now.
Bill: Not that I've been at work more than 5 minutes.

Bill: The actual brand, not the fad stuff being advertised is apparently a handmade japanese frame that's 500 bucks. According to a site that broke down the fashion choices of the movie.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh $500? Fuck no. Hard pass lmao
Bill: Worried the stuff being advertised is going to look crappy cause they capitalizing on Far from Home.
