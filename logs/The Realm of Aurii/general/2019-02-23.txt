N🆗ri (Marisa): he would be such a big meme star if he wasn't dead, on par with bill nye and jack black
N🆗ri (Marisa): like that video of the girls partying in an elevator when bill nye walks in

Bill: Saddest anime deaths.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Pure Steve erwin
Dirty Lego (Tom): I love it
N🆗ri (Marisa): oo katsucon is at the top of the front page of reddit

N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ato4d5/16bit_metroid_cosplay/
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ooo yea I see that guy alot I feel
N🆗ri (Marisa): does anybody know anything about headscarves or hijabs or such
N🆗ri (Marisa): like. wearing them or even just general trivia
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): They go on your head
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds fake but ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): swolfy please tell us more
N🆗ri (Marisa): pls
N🆗ri (Marisa): i  beg
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): So according to old legends, people put items and  garments on their head to show dominance
N🆗ri (Marisa): that explains the fruit
Dirty Lego (Tom): like that one episode of Courage the cowardly dog with bigfoot
N🆗ri (Marisa): when will courage be rebooted
N🆗ri (Marisa): i made this character years and years ago
and some members of my old manga club have been pushing for me to make comics again
so i've been toying with the idea of making mini comics of her but her hair is snakes which are a pain to draw, so i'm considerin' headscarf but i don't know the first thing about them and i'm not good enough friends with the people i do know who use them to just roll up and be like "tell me all your headscarf secrets"
N🆗ri (Marisa): scarf much easier to draw yes
but potentially culturally insensitive????
N🆗ri (Marisa): they sell them at claire's and there's been a big fashion push for them right so i can't be *too* offensive right
Bill: Oh no.
Bill: There's a card for marriott rewards on the new program that's. Good.
Bill: I don't need two fancy credit cards but the rewards perks are.
N🆗ri (Marisa): imagine getting into a customer service argument with an angry middle aged woman when she huffs and pulls a wallet out from this bag
N🆗ri (Marisa): "my husband will hear about this."
Dirty Lego (Tom): i love it
Bill: Weird dream.... I had to go back to tech for some kind of shop certification. So I’m wandering around classes, talking to younger friends (Ryan oddly enough) doing absolutely nothing cause I already graduated and am just there for the time. I end up back on student council some how too. At lunch I meta myself and say “I’m literally Drew Berrymore in that one move”. Also plan how I use my adult camera skills to bust some jock dude on... something, if he’s a bully? Fucking trip.
Bill: Paiva looks good tho.
Bill: Holy fuck.
Bill: Fuck fuck.
Bill: I got bloodwork. I’m so dizzy.
Bill: Can’t even finish with the urine test. Needed to lay down.
Bill: This is new and not cool.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Surprise!!!
Is it fun
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did you know they were gonna steal your blood
バナナ: Do you already know what yoour blood type is?
Bill: Think I was type A.
N🆗ri (Marisa): surprise blood
Bill: Okay. Good now. I have an aversion to needles but never such a bad reaction.
Bill: It’s probably a side effect of low carbs.
N🆗ri (Marisa): could it have been from change in diet?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee
N🆗ri (Marisa): when i get blood drawn i pass out and lose my memory so i wake up like "where am i and who are u people" <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I just had a dream that hal made a stage play for aurii and it became super famous but he butchered all the characters and didn’t credit us at all
N🆗ri (Marisa): and then we butchered him yeah?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _i wish_
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): At the end of the dream I bought tickets and when Afina made her entrance in the play, I looked at Hal and he avoided eye contact
N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw no free tickets
Bill: I think she may have done a shit job drawing the blood too. I can’t look at needles in me, but I bleed way more than usual from the spot after she was done.
N🆗ri (Marisa): you gotta seek vengeance
Bill: Eated big break fast.
Bill: Feel better.
N🆗ri (Marisa): don't pass out ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have so much junk on my desktop i need to delete stuff and maybe get a new wallpaper
N🆗ri (Marisa): but "savior play despacito" is such a classic
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's deltarune but i'm afraid to delete that and destroy my computer
N🆗ri (Marisa): ok

to Being My Journey
of Finding A New Desktop Background
N🆗ri (Marisa): goodnight sweet low quality prince

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Savior, play despacito
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have no idea what my next wallpaper should be i'm so stuck

i considered kamisama no inai nichiyoubi and jibaku shounen hanako-kun for Aesthetic™ but can't find anything good
this will take Much Time
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): All my wallpapers are either bnha, dragon age or MM cuz there the only things I ever find big enough images for cuz seeing pixels makes me sad
N🆗ri (Marisa): [keeps the same wallpaper but adds jpeg artifacts]
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Jpeg artifacts makes me cry
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Whoa I've already had my car 4 years wtf
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’m eternally of the mentality “oh I’ve only driven for like a year”

Bill: Do any of you keep christmas/holiday/birthday cards?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Ye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm a slut for sentimentalism
Bill: *Same* but they're just so pointless, it's not like I read them unless I'm going to throw them out.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yeaaaaa but I still can't throw them out. I'll read them when I clean or move them
N🆗ri (Marisa): i try to but there's nowhere to put them so they wind up getting tossed or thrown out accidentally
Bill: I'm glad I'm not the only one.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh yea def not. My mom keeps them too
N🆗ri (Marisa): a neighbor just knocked on the door? in the rain? to say hi and then leave? ??? who does that what are your motives
Dirty Lego (Tom): Woahhh
