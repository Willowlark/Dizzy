Bill: well. I've committed to happy hour with IBM tonight.
Bill: Ways I am a jackass: I buy an ebook from Amazon, immediately download it, strip the DRM, sync it to my personal library, and download it to ibooks. 

Why not read it in the kindle app? Why not buy it from the ibooks store if I want to read it there?
Bill: Cause it's my goddamn book, I bought it.
Bill: https://lifehacker.com/how-to-manage-your-seasonal-depression-1829966671
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "Other symptoms, in addition to irritability, include: low energy and lethargy, having trouble concentrating, some anxiety, being more reactive to irritants and other triggers, a sudden need to withdraw, an urge to hibernate, a decrease in sexual drive, a change in appetite (particularly a craving for carbohydrates)"
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what a callout post
Dave: Pshhh "seasonal", make it yearly
Bill: They aren't symptoms if they're your normal mood!
Dave: üëå
Bill: I didn't actually read the article tho.
Bill: maybe I shoooould, actually...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the best think about seasonal affective disorder is its literally called SAD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): "About 10 to 20 percent of the United States population experiences SAD, with women making up about 75 percent of that statistic." ooo i didnt know that
Bill: I miss the olden days where I believed as long as you had the willpower you could move past depression.
Dave: Just gotta make something of your life
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no ones immune to depression, seasonal or not.
Bill: what, like working in new york with a master's degree? <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Mmm... you aren't wrong, but I had alot more faith in "where there's a will there's a way" until recently. Sometimes even if you have the will power, your stuck. You can chose not to wallow in it, and keep living, but you can't shake the core of it so easily.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): na it doesnt work like that even the most successful people get depressed
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea sometimes there are circumstances you cant overcome
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and true depression is a chemical imbalance, which you cant change with willpower
Bill: ~~watch me nerd~~
Bill: *wow* I have a new love for Bakugo.
Dave: Yes true, everyone gets depressed at some point in life. You just can't let one small event hold you down. Keep pushing to become a better person.
Bill: you right.
Bill: Bakugo's stupid 'i'll be the best, you can't stop, and I will be better' can apply to more than just ~~punching deku~~ hero work.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): there are way to combat it for sure
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~biru life isnt an anime~~
Bill: pfft. it's better as anime.
Dave: <@351471675843411978> ding ding ding
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): plus there is a difference between sadness and depression, with sadness you can usually pinpoint the source, there is more hope involved with this, you know it will get better, you can see a "silver lining". With depression you'll be very hard pressed to find hope, and there seems to be no "reason" for the feeling
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): https://greatist.com/live/signs-of-depression-am-i-depressed-or-sad
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this is how it starts you see, im reading psychology stuff one minute and then all of a sudden BOOM SEX RESEARCH ARTICLES
Elfriede of commitment?: THATS HOW IT HAPPENS
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): IT IS
Bill: So mix of both on my end.
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): WOO SEX ARTICLES
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): I find more energy during the winter
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): Everyone else is depressed and I‚Äôm like wheeeee
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): God I wish that were me
