Dizzy: You rolled *[1, 1, -1, 0]*  for a total of **1** !
Bill: !fudge
Dizzy: You rolled *[1, 1, 0, 0]*  with a modifier of *-2*  for a total of **0** !
Bill: !fudge -2
Nokri (Marisa): **Zero!**
Dizzy: You rolled *[1, -1, 0, 0]*  with a modifier of *20*  for a total of **20** !
Bill: !fudge +20
Nokri (Marisa): omg bro watch your language
Bill: Fudge dice are 6 sided dice with -1 -1 0 0 1 1 on them. (technically, they have `-` for -1, blank for 0 and `+` for 1 but).
Dizzy: I have the character sheets for these characters!
 ```Alias : Character Name,
elfriede : Elfriede Faun```
Bill: !chlist
Bill: I could add the stopwatch I wasted time on to Dizzy, probably.
Bill: ~~Or I could do the user stats I've been talking about doing for the last year~~

God I wish I could draw.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo das neat
Aldus Larian (Jess): i like the hair down
Bill: Is really good.
Bill: I realized I never gave colors for his bow.
