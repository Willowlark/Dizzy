Bill: !fudge -2
Nokri (Marisa): **Zero!**

Dizzy: I have the character sheets for these characters!
 ```Alias : Character Name,
elfriede : Elfriede Faun```

Bill: I could add the stopwatch I wasted time on to Dizzy, probably.
Bill: ~~Or I could do the user stats I've been talking about doing for the last year~~
