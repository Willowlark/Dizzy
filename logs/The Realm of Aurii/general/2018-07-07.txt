Eliran (Halim): yeah no

Afina (Georgia🍀): There's three cousins my age and all three brought a plus one
Afina (Georgia🍀): Gotta figure out if these plus ones are significant others

Afina (Georgia🍀): i havent talked to roman in months, and he never gets around to answering my texts
Afina (Georgia🍀): but he sends me funny posts on tumblr and also messaged to ask what i want for my bday
Afina (Georgia🍀): 🤔
Nokri (Marisa): Why am I not following you on tumblr when did this happen how did this occur please forgive me for my insolence
Nokri (Marisa): If you don’t know their orientation ask a ouija board but those can be dangerous so ouija responsibly
Afina (Georgia🍀): my dad said she gay
Nokri (Marisa): C o n f i r m e d.
Elfriede (Tom): *gaylocated*
Nokri (Marisa): echologaytion
Nokri (Marisa): There was a big earthquake as I was filling up the bathtub and now I’m too much of a pansy to get clean what if it happens again
I’ll live the rest of my life as dirt
Bill: Aren’t you supposed to get in bathtubs during earthquakes?
Nokri (Marisa): naw u get under a table
Nokri (Marisa): bathtub is hurricanes isn't it
Bill: I definitely think it’s the same...
Bill: Anyway you know Japan get frequent small quakes. Don’t stress them till they actually matter.
Nokri (Marisa): the disaster prep center said nothing about bathtubs either time i went. they always say table. or just stay indoors away from anything that can fall.
i have laundry hanging above my bathtub biru are you trying to get me killed via clothing avalanche
Nokri (Marisa): ye tru there are always small quakes. slightly bigger quakes are still freaky. freaky friday but it's saturday and no one's switching bodies that i'm aware of.
Nokri (Marisa): they recommend you get inside if you're outside during a quake, unless you're standing smack dab in the middle of an empty field
Nokri (Marisa): the only thing google says about bathtubs in an earthquake is to plug it so that drainage and sewage doesn't rise up
that would make me further trash than i already am <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): shocked that i can't find a single anthropomorphized trash anime girl on google right now
Nokri (Marisa): this will have to work
Nokri (Marisa): BoJo is so pure. We were discussing sewing and I mentioned being unsure of a skirt design for a costume I wanted to make and after seeing the picture she’s like “oh you’re gonna need a lot of gold piping. I’ll pick that up this week for you.”
BoJo I’m on the other side of the earth I can’t use that piping but thank
