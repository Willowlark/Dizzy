Bill: Do I want to post the summer loving album of Erik and Lanie...
Bill: Seems weird timing.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): just do it
Bill: Eh. I have other things to post tho.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i feel like all of my content is from 50 billion years ago
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): weather needs to get warm so we can shoooooooooot
Bill: Has been awhile.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like i have maybe 50 unposted photos from previous shoots
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): and when katsu comes i wanna start transitioning to new content
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): but i feel like my old content is SO old
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): I post stuff from 5 years ago I think ur fine posting old stuff
Bill: Make sure to schedule time for it then. You‚Äôre the busy one in spring.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): BIRU can we do mononoke woods shoot when the weather gets gud?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Go into the woods
Frolic
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Touch a tree (with consent)
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): although going into the woods with me and tom ups your chance of seeing a bear like 50%
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Touch a bear (with consent)
Bill: I‚Äôve seen so many in my backyard.
Bill: Also ye.
Bill: I need to do more shooting. Especially if I buy some stuff for lighting.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): whooo
Bill: Nier at buttermilk falls too.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YE
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): NIER AUTOMATOOT
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Don‚Äôt forget fishing poles and mackerel
Bill: *... she has a good point*
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): who wants to be the mackeral
Bill: Speaking of, time to go shopping for lights and sell old camera gear Ron and Mr Braun have given me.
Bill: I thought about trying to do a kofi, but there‚Äôs no way anyone would give me money and light equipment too expensive for that. I‚Äôll have to see what‚Äôs affordable.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cant u do kofi goals tho?
Bill: Ye. No one will do it, by my guess, and that‚Äôd be hella embarrassing, like that print shop ping to BNE.
Bill: Also we‚Äôre talking this stuff is like 500+ kofis.
Bill: 199 for two soft boxes that are smaller than the ones hunter used, but that‚Äôs still better than I thought it‚Äôd be.
Bill: There‚Äôs also umbrella lighting.... ~~And will I really use these or will they end up in the pile of stuff I buy when filled with hopes and dreams~~
Bill: Guy makes a good argument that I could do a flash setup with a bit more forward. Remote flashes, which are diffused, way more portable, useable on camera...
Bill: But again use.
