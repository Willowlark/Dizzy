N🆗ri (Marisa): as someone who is constantly alone 99% of the time I can assuredly say that Cats are Great
Bill: Go visit Andoru at work!
Bill: He's *incredibly* bored!
N🆗ri (Marisa): one time i walked to the bank (across the street from his work, on the side outside of my development) and literally two people called bojo asking if everything was okay because they thought they saw me
Bill: *You need sun my gremlin fren*
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah sometimes it shines in through the little gap in the curtains i made for sylvia and it hits this little solar powered dancing cat present i have

Aldus Larian (Jess): neato
N🆗ri (Marisa): two days until homestuck day
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh shoot do people still wear orange ribbons on homestuck day <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There’s two British professors talking at the table next to me in the student center
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I love the way “tax” sounds with a brutish accent
Andrew: Cheers luv
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg be careful it sounds like they’re planning tariffs and the revolution all over again
Andrew: *Runs over in American "REVOLUTION"
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg his daughter is named georgia
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SMOL WORLD
N🆗ri (Marisa): named after the colony she'll soon be running, no doubt
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just noticed some dude is sitting outside on a chair facing my window/door i'm leaning against. sorry sylvia i'm closing the curtains that's creepy
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah he's on the phone i think but still freaky
Aldus Larian (Jess): is it a public area?
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's another neighborhood
N🆗ri (Marisa): i take pic
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's to the left but basically my bed which i never leave is against this big double door on the second floor that overlooks the other neighborhood
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo its like eyespy
N🆗ri (Marisa): phone dude isn't in the picture <:rip:369476083248267274> but he's around back of another building facing this way, not out from of a house or anything which is what makes it weird
i'm also horrified the neighbor might come out on their balcony and stare at me some day
N🆗ri (Marisa): their balcony is literally 3 feet away from me
Aldus Larian (Jess): OHHHH
N🆗ri (Marisa): sowwy made you eye spy for nothing
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok i thought he was acroos the parking lot and i was like "wtf is this bitch"
Aldus Larian (Jess): dat ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): if he can see in i didn't want him to be like "why this chick takin' pictures of me while i stare at her house"
Andrew: that reminds me of freshman year anime club during the glassboro comminuty day thing
Andrew: the old lady we were cleaning her yard had a feud with some creepy italian neigbor and he stood out his door staring at us for 2 hours
N🆗ri (Marisa): REALLY
are u sure it wasn't because justin or somebody was blasting loud anime music as loud as their car would go
Andrew: Im locking in on how you calle dout justin XD
Andrew: Fyi he is going to sakura
Bill: Fuck.
Andrew: ya.
Andrew: He asked if i was oging
Aldus Larian (Jess): whomst
Andrew: He was a friend in college
Andrew: of me, not Billiam.
Bill: He's... well, he's like Yoosung but a creep.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was friends with him because alexa was cool and he was dating alexa but apparently they ended things less than cordially
he registered for classes in the middle of the day in another class when he wasn't supposed to, and then refused to put his computer away <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: That amde sensei veeeeeeeeeryy upset
Andrew: I never knew exactly what happened between him and alexa but she was very upset
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i didn't know about it until a while later but it must've been awful because she just never talked about it ever. cheating maybe? alexa is so great how could he be mean to her <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
didn't he flunk out of japanese, or at least barely scrape by with a passing grade?
Andrew: yea i thinmk he barely passed
Andrew: I was glad to see alexa moved on
Andrew: He was in japanese 3 or 4 and couldnt read hiragana
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT
Andrew: yea
N🆗ri (Marisa): HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE how did he even get past japanese 1
Andrew: dunno
Andrew: I never studied with him tbh
Bill: So. Alexa lived in whitney.
Andrew: i studied with bill and chris more
Bill: I ran into her on the elevator one night.
Bill: She like, cried at me for like 30 minutes about Justin dumping her.
Bill: Totally out of the blue.
Andrew: She called me crying about it but she didnt say what happened just that she was really upset
Bill: As I vaguely recall she said she slept with him and over the summer he was just done with her?
Bill: I don't like Justin.
Andrew: It was something like that
Andrew: I told him id be at sunday with people
Andrew: I told him it i was with you Bill john and aaron
Andrew: I told him that i made plans to go already with you guys and that i wasnt going to hang out with him
Andrew: Realizing that i said "I told him" in three posts
Bill: lol
Andrew: Hes aware that you dont like him
Bill: OH lol
Andrew: Pseudo tried to invite himself
Bill: I was going to say I'll just glare at him if he comes up.
Andrew: but i told him you prob wouldnt like that
N🆗ri (Marisa): he coupled cosplayed with alexa that's a big deal that punk
Andrew: he did Mirai nikki
Andrew: didnt he
Bill: oh ouch. Did you just use me as a Justin-aversion-stick?
Andrew: Partly?
Andrew: he told me that he knew you ddint like him
Andrew: and i told him first that i was going to be with other people
Andrew: before i named names
Bill: I mean, you *probably* don't want to get in the habit of saying other people don't like someone. But, it IS Justin and I don't like him so.
Andrew: No its not a good habit
Andrew: i will refrain in the future
Bill: Tank but also if I scare him off it was worth it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye he and alexa were at animenext as mirai nikki
Andrew: On to happier note im going to get my measurements to order all might soon.
Bill: YASSS
N🆗ri (Marisa): *all might and mirio*
