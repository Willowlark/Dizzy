Bill: Fuck I’m in rush hour traffic.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i cant email my suitemates to introduce myself because i come off as a mega nerd my god
Bill: I mean.
Bill: Is that untrue?
Bill: Be yourself.
Afina (Georgia🍀): my mom said to try to keep it brief
Afina (Georgia🍀): so they dont make too many judgements "without seeing my perky face"
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think shes trying to nicely say "youll sound like a basement dwelling neckbeard so at least let them see youre cute and get confused"
Bill: Not true. You’re assumptions anyway.
Bill: But she has a point, introductions are better in person. What you should here is just open a channel for any room things you need to plan out, like “I’m bringing a tv” or “I’m vegan” or “I’m deathly allergic to tide”.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i said my name, my major, where im from, when i plan to move in, and the fact that ill be bringing a TV for our living room
Afina (Georgia🍀): and then i told them to follow me on FB or text me
