El🆓de Faun (Tom): "Moderate extraversion: In the Big Five, being an extravert is all about engagement with the world. That includes your interest in socializing, of course, but it’s also tied to your energy levels and ability to feel excited about other people and society at large. Because people who score in the middle of a trait tend to experience a little of what those on either pole feel, you’re likely getting a taste of the benefits afforded to the higher extraverts — popularity, a general sense of well-being — while also experiencing some of the drawbacks of relative introversion, such as a limited dating pool (at least compared with the real social butterflies). And that’s OK. Being in the middle ain’t so bad, really."
