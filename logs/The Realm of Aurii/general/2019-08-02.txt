Nokri (Marisa): look at all the likes!! it did good!!
Nokri (Marisa): remembers book i wanted but it was $25
looks book up in my library of uh. online books that are totally legal
there it is for free. beautiful
Nokri (Marisa): it reminds of one time we were reading a book in class at rowan and like 80% of the students didn't have the book, including me. everyone began frantically searching for it free online and i was the only one who found a copy and i started e-mailing it to people and it spread through the class like wildfire since everyone was desperate to get a copy before the professor called on them to read

we were in the very back and the poor saps up front were all sharing one person's book, the one copy got passed to like 10 people before someone else had their own book
Nokri (Marisa): oh rip i was gonna share the book here but it's over 8mb
Nokri (Marisa): hmu if u want books
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wats the book? :o
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): It’s a modern beastiary
Nokri (Marisa): Am reading about aardvarks
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa!
Bill: D&D went better this time. Mostly cause I rolled well on my new dice from Ota.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Modern beastiary sounds cool 🤘
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Makes it sound to fantastical
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I almost thought that said *Big, Bad Book of **Breasts***
Bill: Sleepy. Haven’t opened laptop.
Bill: Need to open laptop so I’m logged into slack if Gord checks.
Bill: And. Also to work.
Bill: I hear Cicadas outside.
Bill: What an august mood.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hung a thing of fly paper in my office to try to catch all the flies that have been buzzing around but I think it's just attracting them and they're just chilling in the window getting high
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Omgg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so now I have like 10 blow flies just chilling in my window
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ughhhh
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That's so bad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe I need to hang it in an area that has less landing space
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): caught one!
Bill: Also got approval for apartment.
Bill: And the mere concept of packing up all of my possessions to move in is dissuading me from wanting to do it.
Bill: Also the 'actually seeing the unit I'll be living in issue'.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): did you at least see their sample unit?
Bill: Oh yeah.
Bill: But like, I wouldn't buy a car without driving that exact car.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): true
Bill: I'd be fine to wait till they do their updates or whatever to view it, but not if they're going to keep the 500 dollars hold deposit on the apartment if I wait.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): to be fair, I haven't seen the one I'm actually living in either
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm actually heading out to drop my security deposit off soon 😛
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): security deposited <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOO! congrats!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Aldus Larian (Jess): FUCK i gotta pay the rent
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YE
Tikur (Kurtis): WOO!
Bill: Woo!
Bill: Going over in an hour to see if I can Karen my way into seeing the interior before the hold deposit expires.
Bill: Also. Not exactly excited. I never am for this kind of thing but.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _karen my way into_
Nokri (Marisa): If someone’s living there now they won’t be able to let you see it tho
Nokri (Marisa): Unless that person consents
Bill: They left yesterday.
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the landlord said the building I'm in is a nice building and has never had any problems from it. He said there's a lot of elderly people in that building and they *bake* a lot. Also my unit overlooks the courtyard/pool area
Bill: Would I really entertain that much. Probably not.
Bill: Like I want to hang out all the time but this isn’t college not that I did much in college either.
Bill: (I’m making pro cons cause I’m a nerrrrd)
Bill: Important pro, I’m closer to Chili’s!
Bill: Question is am I willing to walk on seeing the exact unit.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I want to make like a ritual, it would be really cool to once a week go on like r/gif recipes and make something on there
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Maybe one a week is too much 🤔
Aldus Larian (Jess): we're doing rituals now?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :summoning_circle:

Bill: The pool like, one building away is nice.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh that cheaper than mine
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was just gonna do it through progressive since that who my car insurance is through and it was like $146 for the year
Bill: I did it through liberty which is my car insurance.
Bill: Weird little park area, north of the apartment. Like two picnic tables and a campground style grill.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Zombi is a national treasure
Bill: Didn’t get to see it, but Monday she’s going to call with the results of string pulling to make seeing it happen.
Bill: Either way, feel significantly better talking to this person over the one on the phone.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good job Karen 👍
Bill: also fuck you for getting washer/dryer in unit.
Bill: Those are *rare* around here.
