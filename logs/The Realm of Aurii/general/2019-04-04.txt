N🆗ri (Marisa): Nya
N🆗ri (Marisa): Like, you know. **Nya**
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like... ***nya***?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > sees Tyler's story
> Tyler: "We just bought like, $1200 worth of kitchen supplies
> Me: "Why?"
Bill: Alcohol, probably.
Bill: I want to live their life, and I also know I could never in reality.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no.... like, actually kitchen supplies
Bill: *There is a way to use anything they bought in the ~~abuse~~ consumption of alcohol*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): They probably were like "yo wanna make brownies?" 
"Yea dude but I dont have the right pan"
" that's ok let's go to the kitchen outlet store to get a good one."
" while we're here let's just get a whole new kitchen"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): First world problems
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's like beyond first world
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 1% population problems
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's all them
Andrew: New costume i guess
Elfriede Faun (Tom): ***hello***
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Whoa I wake up and don’t have to catch up on messages
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That never happens
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I know, it was weird
Aldus Larian (Jess): my boss is back <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): he smells so strongly of old man i can tell he went though my office while i was in the bathroom
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ew
Aldus Larian (Jess): its like potpourri
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my boss is like that too, except she smells of overwhelming perfume and causes me to get a headache LOL
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ2mPfFe24I
Bill: I just got notified by Japneet yesterday that the company is signed up for various training courses offered by Linkedin.
Bill: Which is neat.
Bill: But I checked.
Bill: There are *lightroom* courses available on the platform.
Bill: *lol* this video is just free presets.
Bill: I'll take em.
Bill: ~~I'm looking at the descriptions and realizing I have nothing to learn at this level~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just got followed by hematologist from Uruguay wtf lol
Bill: hehe. Even with the advanced filter on these course I know my shit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): my niece has crested the 3 lb mark!
Bill: oooh, Unique is doing the wolf photo trip thing again.
Bill: watching a backlighting video on linkedin...
Bill: Whenever I see a model in a tutorial series they also look so. Uninterested.
Bill: Damn.
Bill: Maybe it cause I work with friends, but most cosplayers take an actual interest in the photography side. Pro models just look bored.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): its their job
Bill: yeah.
Bill: Just seems sad.
Bill: Cause the photographer, given they're choosing to do a lecture series, is really passionate about the work and what they're doing and the model isn't so there's this disconnect.
Bill: I get why they don't care, it's a job yeah.
Bill: But I don't see that feeling in cosplay, because cosplayer actual care about their photos.
Bill: Like, it's nicer to see the passion on both sides of the equation.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cosplayers genuinely want to be there doing those photos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so it makes sense
Bill: ye.
Bill: +1 cosplay.
Bill: Like, I'm not bashing the model. It's just a different mood.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i feel you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah Ben brought his friend who does model photography to a shoot once
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And she said the energy during the shoot was unreal, and it was really refreshing to work with someone that was engaged and “not like they’re dead”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also that models can be a little demanding
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like “how dare you make me squat this long”
N🆗ri (Marisa): meanwhile cosplayers are like "i can't feel my legs but keep shooting." "you want me to jump in this lake? i'll jump in this lake it'll look sweet"
Bill: oh boy I wanna play with my flashes more.
Bill: Couple of the things this guy did were neat.
Bill: And I wanna buy more umbrellas, maybe another small reflector...
Bill: 
Bill: Well, I can get a reflector the same size as the one at zenkai that has 5 sides rather than two (like the big one) for 10 bucks.
Bill: So that’s a non factor. The flashes were the expensive bit.
Bill: it warm enough to bird stalk on the porch again.
Bill: nice.
Andrew: Is it bad that i spent the wee hours last night catching up to the promised neverland manga
N🆗ri (Marisa): Good
Bill: > Spotify "Have a great day" playlist
> 2/3 songs are from Guardians
> Checks out
Andrew: I think ill do a cosplay of Norman, seeing as alll i need to get is white pants
N🆗ri (Marisa): WOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): DO IT
Andrew: I think i will because its casual and i need more of those
Bill: it's like 4/7 now holy shit.
Bill: Not that guardians isn't the best music ever but.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's great!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'm unsure ifff I wanna read the manga or wait for season 2
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But that's a whole year away
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'll prob read it eventually
Andrew: I was riding the wave after finishing the show but I was genuinely curious what happened next, and I'm glad I did.
Andrew: It was good
Andrew: Or is i should say since it's still ongoing.
Bill: I gotta put up an umbrella when I sit out here. Can barely see my laptop screen.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Both first world problems
Bill: 🖕
N🆗ri (Marisa): So much just happened. I was trying chihiro on to mess with the sleeves, and in the ten minutes of doing that my package was delivered. So I went out front for .2 seconds to grab a package just out of reach of the door. My phone rang but I didn’t get it in time. It’s BoJo. She only calls when something is wrong so I call her back. She’s calling to tell me our neighbor called her because the neighbor saw a package out front. I tell BoJo I missed her call because I was getting the package out front. She says ok and she’s gonna call the neighbor back. Ok. 
While all this is happening someone is doing car donuts in the parking lot with their back trunk open.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMFAO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): LMAO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): What a who's on first
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I'm planning on getting a haircut on Saturday. Not sure what I want to do. I've been doing some variation of side part for so long. Kind of want to go back to shorter on sides, longer on top, and semi-fauxhawk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.instagram.com/p/BtifAYjBtUL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Something like this, but not as dramatically short on the sides
N🆗ri (Marisa): his last name is spaghetto hehehe
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think that’d be a neat haircut
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had something similar several years ago when I went through my Tenth Doctor phase
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it was a good look
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.instagram.com/p/BYoFjKXj1Nz/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=ox8b37ct8j3n
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not the best example of it styled, but ye
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooo yea try that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Though Idk bout them sideburns
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Gives me 80s vibes
Bill: My laptop dying at 15% is one way to get outta a conference call.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the sideburns were specifically for the cosplay
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I did wear them normally for a while
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): these were way too long though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I did ironically have mutton chops during my summer semester when my hair was long (kind of like now but not quite as long)
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol my heater was melting the wire for my surge protector/battery back up at work
Bill: Sounds dangerous.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yikes
Aldus Larian (Jess): It should be ok now
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no its the part of the day where i stand blankly into my screen and do nothing
Bill: mood
