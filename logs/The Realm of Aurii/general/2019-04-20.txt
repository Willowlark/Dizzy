Aldus Larian (Jess): *get to skating*
"Ladies only for this song!"
Me: "excuse me sir, thats my emotional support husband"
Bill: All the single ladies jealous af
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "let's go lesbians!"
Bill: Lesbean skate.
Bill: Ugu... I want to do something but also still hazy from allergies earlier.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Them allergies are killer
Aldus Larian (Jess): I survived
Aldus Larian (Jess): I lived bitch
Bill: I have Allegra again so I should be good but boi does the haze kill my mood.
Bill: Why are good moods so volatile?
Aldus Larian (Jess): What does that even mean
Bill: Good moods are easily lost. Be it something you read bothering you, a sour conversation or choice of words, even just having an allergy induced haze.
Bill: Is it weird I find the darkroom red lighting from those V photos relaxing?
Bill: The way this works is really neat actually... So usually when you have a tinted shade of the world around you, it‚Äôs sunglasses. You kinda expect everything to have that same tint to it. 

The led bulbs are the tinting source though. They can be overpowered by another light and that makes the other light normal. My phone and computer look the same, cause the screens emit enough light to ‚Äúeliminate‚Äù the ambient red.
Bill: Even the light on a charger for my switch still shows screen, and the shelf the light is pointed at isn‚Äôt tinted red but a more normal color because the status light overpowers the red.
Bill: So something‚Äôs look perfectly normal, but everything else is tinted. It‚Äôs an odd feeling.
Bill: </rant>
