Bill: “Hope is going to sleep on a bad day and believing that tomorrow will be better.”
Bill: >goes to bed in protest of today
Nokri (Marisa): Today I spent Too Much™ on anime and then had a whammy of an existential crisis. My vacation is going great so far. I should have brought my camera but going to the zoo was a spontaneous decision which I am not known for because they are very uncomfortable. I can get into the zoo for free any day though it’s gr8.
Bill: Proud of you.
Bill: I really hope today goes better than yesterday... what optimism I have is rather fragile.
Nokri (Marisa): If it doesn’t come to the zoo with me the prairie dogs are very photogenic
Nokri (Marisa): Bring the new recruit and some bagels
Bill: Whose the new recruit?
Nokri (Marisa): thanks to my existential crisis i can now read piano-oriented sheet music and understand how to play the piano. it's all fallen into place.
Nokri (Marisa): idk didn't you have to train someone
Nokri (Marisa): did they get fired
Bill: No. Also fuck that. I’ll bring Andoru, and our trio can be reunited.
Nokri (Marisa): i have a membership at a local karaoke chain with overpriced beverages we can go to <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): wasn't there a person you had to train named jingle or something or did i hallucinate that
Bill: Yeah.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: Oh yeah. My turn on the dream stories. I had dreamed Meg and Georgia, in full Pyrrha, were sitting in the backyard and chatting. When I was going out there, this absolutely beautiful Fox was sitting under a bush and I went right back inside for my camera. 

So not to scare the fox, which had moved like 10 feet from Georgia and was catnapping and being cute, I went to my bedroom window that over looks the backyard and used my super telephoto. Whenever I took a test shot of Georgia it worked, but whenever I tried to shoot the fox the lens would sit at an angle in the mount and take a bad photo. I kept trying till I woke up.
Bill: I woke up meaning to check my lens and camera for this weird damage. God it was beautiful fox tho.
Nokri (Marisa): o i have books about dream symbols. i used to be really into new age stuff. that's definitely some kind of freudian subconscious symbolism mumbo jumbo.
Bill: Where have you been with all of Georgias escape dreams.
Nokri (Marisa): if u need a book check the box in the corner of the third floor once the temperature cools down and it's physically possible to get up to the third floor
Nokri (Marisa): those sound like normal cool dreams tho
Nokri (Marisa): are they funky dreams
georgia take a book look too
Nokri (Marisa): like georgia's last dream sounds like an episode of a popular american sitcom
Nokri (Marisa): georgia i know some tv producers in nyc. keep a dream journal and come up with a pitch and we'll have a netflix original in no time.
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): so you're lonely but don't trust anyone because everyone is a backstabber
Bill: 
Bill: ~~I like foxes why is all this bad stuff?~~
Nokri (Marisa): everything in a person's subconscious is horrible
Nokri (Marisa): what's the world record for number of people yelling "cravat" at the same time
Aldus (Jess): many
Nokri (Marisa): i was hoping less than 3
Bill: I guess it means I can't trust that Georgia character.
Bill: really sketchy.
Nokri (Marisa): not until the intervention
Afina (Georgia🍀): Too judgemental, that's me 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): I had a dream that I was in RWBY and I had a time travel king semblance and I kept resetting to try to save Pyrrha
