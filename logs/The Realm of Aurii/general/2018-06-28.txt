Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): "oh yeah lol"
Afina (Georgia🍀): YALL I GOT ANOTHER WEIRD ASS DREAM
Afina (Georgia🍀): This one was convoluted as fuck
Afina (Georgia🍀): So the world was exactly the same as now, except it was split half and half between people with COOL POWERS and normies
Nokri (Marisa): does it involve murderous bear mascots on an ice skating ink in the basement of a shopping mall owned by your family that has faulty doors because if so  we're spiritually connected
Afina (Georgia🍀): So we all went to a con and were havin fun
Afina (Georgia🍀): Marisa plz that would be epic but sadly no
Afina (Georgia🍀): ANYWAYS we went to a con
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I think Bill had some kinda normal ability because he was in some kinda government program to advocate for equal treatment of people with Powers™
Afina (Georgia🍀): So here's where it gets weird
Afina (Georgia🍀): Apparently the hotel we were staying at was under control of some human anti-powers group
Afina (Georgia🍀): So they like, stormed all the rooms and were dragging people out and questioning them
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I was like whoA THATS BAD
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then _Jamie_ kicked down our door and was like "I'm bringing you all in"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And bill was all "you can't do this, we're legally protected here" and Jamie was like "don't care"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I think my ability was teleporting (like popping in and out of existence like tracer) and Jess was some kinda vampire dealio
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk what tom or Marisa had cause I was to busy _kickin butt_
Afina (Georgia🍀): So then like I beat Jamie and I was like YEAH DONT MESS and we went back to doing con things
Afina (Georgia🍀): The end
Nokri (Marisa): omg i was there???? what an honor!???!?
I like how biru's just like "u can't do that"
doesn't it suck when the hotel double books events smh
Nokri (Marisa): georgia saved cosplay
Bill: what so I'm like, the token scrub?
Bill: Woo!
Nokri (Marisa): georgia do you read UnOrdinary
Bill: Sarcastic woo!
Bill: Man, Gord likes to talk.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah Bill I wanna say you had like healing abilities or something easily hidden
Bill: tis fine.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah I do not
Bill: I also realize Jamie is the villain in this and I'm like owo.
Nokri (Marisa): unordinary is really similar to that it's a webcomic if u liked your dream you might like the comic
Afina (Georgia🍀): HOW WEIRD RIGHT
Afina (Georgia🍀): she gave me the smack around too
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think I ended up winning by palm striking her in the nose
Afina (Georgia🍀): I did like my dream lmao
Bill: All you need is magnetism powers.
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I teleported insteaddddd
Bill: But how will you be irl Pyrrha.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Weirddddddd
Afina (Georgia🍀): If I'm irl Pyrrha I'd also die 🤔
Bill: Your Jaune is less incompetent, he'll make sure you live. 👌
Bill: School stress maybe?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~Nier probably~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): If we're being honest 😂😂
Bill: *Go install chips*
Bill: scrub.
Bill: You need a full install to be relevant, not like you get much else other than storage space from leveling up.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _huh_
Afina (Georgia🍀): Maybe I should just restart, I'm only 10 hours of gameplay in apparently
Aldus (Jess): WHAT NO
Aldus (Jess): dont restart
Aldus (Jess): the chips are easy to purchase and install, you can grind on just about anything
Bill: You probably have a ton.
Aldus (Jess): yea that too
Bill: deadly heal, auto heal. Deadly heal is 5% per +1 of your health restored on a kill, auto heal automatically uses recoveries when your health gets so and so low.
Bill: As long as the enemies don't two shot your health bar specifically and you keep killing scrubs, you'll never die.
Aldus (Jess): and hit dat doge every othe second
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh Ye I'm good with dodge lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): My last save is before I can visit a store though
Bill: also shockwave is really good, gives you reach with your slashes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I'm wedged between a boss fight and a hard place
Bill: Check your inventory, you probably have a ton of chip drops.
Aldus (Jess): also you might be able to switch pod modes if youvve found any other pods
Bill: iirc you had to buy pod programs.
Aldus (Jess): i found 1 i think
Bill: Hammer is best.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lemme check real fast
Afina (Georgia🍀): I had a few chip thingies but nothin crazy
Bill: Just get through spider and go straight to resistance camp.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I don't have a lot of space unlocked either hmmmm
Bill: I thought you get space from leveling.
Bill: any of the heal chips are worth it.
Elfriede (Tom): You can buy more chips
Elfriede (Tom): From the shop
Elfriede (Tom): Also that's a fantastic dream as usual
Elfriede (Tom): I love that chibi old Aldi with the bow omg
Aldus (Jess): NO NO OLD BABY ALDI
Afina (Georgia🍀): I was worried that my workout yesterday wasn't intense enough but like... even the muscle by my collarbone hurts
Afina (Georgia🍀): I didn't even know there was a muscle there
Aldus (Jess): oh yea
Aldus (Jess): i am also in pain
Aldus (Jess): and thought i didnt do that much
Bill: Ah, the old Pyrrha-neck-piece-muscle.
Elfriede (Tom): I did some yesterday too! Cept I'm not in pain... Prob wasn't hard enough..
Afina (Georgia🍀): well soreness usually happens from using muscles you never really use
Afina (Georgia🍀): like collarbone muscle i guess
Afina (Georgia🍀): like the workout was equally intense on my upper arms but those are significantly less sore
Aldus (Jess): my friend had me do ALOT of stuff ive never done so ye im ded
Afina (Georgia🍀): full body or did you focus on one thing?
Aldus (Jess): full body
Aldus (Jess): we gonna do cardio on friday
Aldus (Jess): ~~she wanted me to do burpess and i was like hellz nah~~

Bill: I hate losing charms.
Aldus (Jess): I found it I found it
Bill: I want my sympathy back.
Aldus (Jess): *returned*
Aldus (Jess): All though I have lost then before
Aldus (Jess): Also I made a fool out a myself walking the same 15 ft back and forth at the park
Bill: I just got super tired. Like, benedryl, fall asleep in chair tried.
Bill: What’s with that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 6 pm slump?
Bill: Is that a thing?
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~maybe?~~
Bill: 🙄
Bill: Helpful.
Afina (Georgia🍀): tryna make you feel better lmao
Bill: I just wanna be awake. I need my hours of the day.
Afina (Georgia🍀): take a 5 hour energy ~~and promptly throw up cause that shit nasty~
Bill: Plus this is the kind of tired that leads to honesty hour in DMs which I don’t need.
Bill: I tried one of those, does nothing.
Bill: Back in college.
Afina (Georgia🍀): :oc
Afina (Georgia🍀): sleep to protect your secrets
Bill: I don’t have any running DMs so...
Elfriede (Tom): "you just, put the fucking thing in the fucking thing"
Bill: Glorious.
