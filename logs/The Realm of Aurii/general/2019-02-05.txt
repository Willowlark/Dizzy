N🆗ri (Marisa): I was practicing high kicks on the stairs and kicked my phone across the room. Oops.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): kicking is fun
N🆗ri (Marisa): try it at work
Dirty Lego (Tom): O do that too Marisa it's okay
Bill: ... Now I might end up on a fourth project.
Bill: Not lucky. I’m being pulled in too many directions.
Bill: Who wants to buy me a beer later. ~~Though I’m becoming partial to wine recently~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): the pain in my hand is starting to go away a bit so i can take it out of the bowl now ;u;
i'm super calloused and rugged now perfect for crossplaying
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You've been in a bowl that whole time? 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it's been too painful to take out so i've been carrying it around and replacing the water every few minutes <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've lost feeling in most of my fingers except for the sensation of pain but i can bend my finger a little more luckily
Bill: Do you need a doctor.
Bill: You sound like you need a doctor.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nah my hand is still attached to the rest of my body
N🆗ri (Marisa): i should be able to start sewing again in a few more hours if the pain keeps fading and i use a thimble or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): plus side: i won't be able to feel anything if i stab myself with a needle
Dirty Lego (Tom): Did you burn with pan or water?
N🆗ri (Marisa): metal 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): there was a metal spoon in the pan that was cooking and it was in there for a few minutes so the spoon was super hot
Bill: I worry far too much about you for it to be healthy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how was i supposed to know metal gets hot when exposed to fire for several minutes <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh you grab it 🔥
Dirty Lego (Tom): Is the burn at least confine to a small section of your hand?
Dirty Lego (Tom): I've grabbed a pan straight out of the over before
Dirty Lego (Tom): Hope boi
N🆗ri (Marisa): my index finger and thumb got the worst of it, and then a bit of my middle and ring fingers. my pinky is pretty fine.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how else are you supposed to get a pan out of the oven
Dirty Lego (Tom): Damn you must have really grabbed that thing with a purpose
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was gonna stir the rice
i didn't grab it fully though or my pinky would've been messed up too, it was just REALLY hot
N🆗ri (Marisa): i didnt think spoons could get that hot
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah that's surprising
Dirty Lego (Tom): Dayum 🙏
Dirty Lego (Tom): Your todoroki cosplay is coming along nicely
N🆗ri (Marisa): thx i've got the mental scarring down pat
N🆗ri (Marisa): *deku messed up my hand*
N🆗ri (Marisa): i burn my hand on a daily basis with heat guns and hot glue, those aren't bad at all and don't hurt more than a few seconds
but this spoon was like the powe r500 heat guns and glue guns combined
