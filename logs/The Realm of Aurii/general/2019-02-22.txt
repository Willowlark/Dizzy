Bill: Who is David Chan and why are they friending me on Facebook.
Bill: ~~you realize Georgia is the famous one running the shoot at Zenkai right~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): david-chan uwu
Bill: My cars beeping at me is giving me a like panic attack. It beeped when I was backing up towards the boyfriends (poorly parked) car and now I’m wigging out.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the car yell
Dirty Lego (Tom): She scream
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i just briefly thought it was monday?

Bill: That scary
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ill take it if its too scary for you
Bill: Already deposited.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had a fever dream I was doing laundry but there were already clothes in the dryer so I just sat and lamented with wet clothes in my arms instead of putting the dryer clothes away
N🆗ri (Marisa): Our microwave is broken how am I supposed to make food without contaminating everything with the Black Death
N🆗ri (Marisa): I would say no food but that was my solution yesterday

N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah they used to have mail-order houses in the 1920s!! Isn’t that neat

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA alot of them are still standing
N🆗ri (Marisa): But sears and Home Depot sell diffewait
No one ships anything anymore the postal service is dead and transportation is cancelled
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh my aunt and uncle are selling their wildwood houses so that plan for beach pictures is moot
Reportedly over the year I was in japan, a brewery bought all the property across the street and next door and turned it into a party place so what was once a quiet residential neighborhood next to the beach is now a nonstop drunken party fest and all the surrounding houses are gone so they’re selling the property to the brewery <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh no! 😦 that sucks for residents
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah, like they went down last summer to enjoy a nice weekend and it was too loud to sleep at all, people kept pounding on the door and cars at night and there were passed out teens on the porch in the morning
N🆗ri (Marisa): My aunt and uncle are the kind of people who get up at 5am for a leisurely stroll so they weren’t very happy at all
Bill: Mawisa your going to like, eat right.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Grass... tastes bad <:pew:543202259085950996>
