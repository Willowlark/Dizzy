So what if someone did an anime name that tune panel but they threw in a song from some super messed up hentai
Then if someone in the audience knows they have to weigh the potential for winning against being ousted as a hentai watcher in front of a huge crowd <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): For the people that are super confident or just too wound up to realize what they’re doing, they brazenly shout “that’s the theme song for *passionate harem xxx lewd dungeon fetish King!*”
and then the whole room goes silent and they have to face the judgemental stares of everyone as it’s revealed they’re correct. 
They may have earned the point, but at what cost? At what cost.
Bill: Pretty sure that happened in anime club. Aaron said in his ice breaker he liked stringendo or something like that, which is hentai and anyone who whoo’d busted themselves.
