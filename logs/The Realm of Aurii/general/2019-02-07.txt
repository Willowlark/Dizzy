Bill: If Aurii itself is dead... inviting anyone new to the server outta BNE is a straight up “join my social circle” invite. No excuse it’s an invite for the game. 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is it dead?!?!??!!?!?? <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> 
What’s the new server I am confuse when did it die
Bill: it's not like... officially. Is just not being played.
Bill: > comes to a complete stop on rt 80 at exit 30, going to 35
> now I remember why I don’t do this every day
Bill: Not that I don’t hit traffic when I drive to Armonk, on 80. But getting stuck in traffic on the way to public transportation just frustrates.
バナナ: Gotta love that road construction 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): Follower to like ratios on insta are so weird. Like. I’m talking with a girl who has 13.5k followers but her pictures get an average of 400-500 likes. Her followers all look real. Social media is weird
Dirty Lego (Tom): So wierd
N🆗ri (Marisa): So wierd
N🆗ri (Marisa): I feel sad not being able to help my Japanese acquaintances across the world 
One girl is posting that she’s so stressed she wants to harm herself. Though at least her idea of self-harm is getting an ear piercing and not anything worse at the moment.
Bill: That's... A unique idea for that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): A lotta peeps in japan don’t have ear piercings and I guess technically it is self harm? She’s thinking of getting it done properly at a parlor
Bill: yeah I mean... I'm all for encouraging that's the definition of self harm.
Bill: Better than something that's... actually harmful.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I wonder if my friend’s mom ever found out about her secret ear tattoo. I’ve been curious about that for years. Friend was not allowed to get a tattoo but went and sneakily got one for her birthday
Bill: ooooh, sneak.
Bill: I'd be killed and left for the buzzards if I got a tattoo while I live at home.
N🆗ri (Marisa): So would she that’s why I’m so curious
N🆗ri (Marisa): Get a tramp stamp
Bill: I don't do enough lewd things to warrant that.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Wow srsly billiam?
Dirty Lego (Tom): You don't seem like someone who's get one anyway but
Bill: Which tempers the opinion, I've never seriously considered a tattoo. But my parents don't like tattoos.
Dirty Lego (Tom): My mom and dad never liked them either but they prob wouldn't care
Dirty Lego (Tom): I mean my brother has like 6 already
Bill: I dunno exactly how it would go, but not well will be the theme.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~i mean ive heard toms mom say "her tatoos are nice, too bad she'll go to hell for them"~~
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah my mom has always been like that
Dirty Lego (Tom): Cuz my great grandma said it once
Dirty Lego (Tom): So therefore it is now lae
Bill: It's not religious here... at least not presented so. Biggest argument I remember against is 'businesses will refuse to hire you' which is somewhat true.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Some yeah will judge you if you have an exposed tattoo
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i meannnn if its in a visible spot when wearing business coloths
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah exactly
Bill: Bessemer will *not* hire anyone with piercings (beyond like, ears for women) or tattoos at teh company because they very old fashioned.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): how tf would they know though?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like if you have a tattoo on your back and you always wear shirts that cover it welp they're not gonna know
Bill: photos on social media?
Bill: Bessemer has a very strict brand image.
Bill: Which isn't really wrong imo.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): like my ex coworker has tatoos on his legs, he doesnt have social media and he always wore dress pants to work
Dirty Lego (Tom): Id personally consider a piercing long before a tatoo
Dirty Lego (Tom): Piercings beyond gauges are on temporary
Bill: god gauges are stupid.
Bill: Never have I seen someone with gauges who didn't look like an elephant reject.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I disagree, not wanting them shown in the workplace is one thing. dictating what you put on your body is just... perpetuating the whole "we own you" mentality that old fashioned business have
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): depend on the size of the gauge imo
Bill: I'm pretty sure if I got a piercing I'd be assumed gay. I don't have an edge factor to my look. And a tattoo would be weird for the same reason, I'm just... not the type for that look?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I used to have smol ones
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean if its not for you its not for you.
Bill: ye. I'm just imagining.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Anyways sorry for getting off topic, sorry to.hear that about your friend Marisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ain’t no goin off topic s’fine~
Bill: 
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is this a weeb thing?
Bill: Nope.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sounds neat, but im probably gonna be busy that day
N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw no weeb thing <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: I mean, it's a *singles* meetup group. I didn't think you'd be jumping on it to begin with.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i though you were sharing cuz you wanted people to go
Bill: If I go, I'd certainly welcome company (as it so happens people go to bars in groups by default so going alone is weird...!). But between it being an hour from home, a bar, and nothing but socializing... I'd imagine the only perk in it for you or Tom would be the Asian food. XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i doubt hed be interested
Bill: Obviously I do a lot of inviting people out, but I have my limits.
Bill: I'm not even going to comfortable, I wouldn't stick anyone else with that. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have made some

N🆗ri (Marisa): omg so this weekend's wedding is supposed to be really fancy
if im in the middle of a conversation i don't want to be in I can just go "Please excuse me. I'm going to retrieve some cake to stuff in my face" and walk away gracefully
Bill: DO IT
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Take me as your guest
N🆗ri (Marisa): "i beg your pardon. i know you're in the middle of recounting a fascinating tale, but i just saw a server with fruit on toothpicks and i'm going to ask him if the toothpicks are made from the same tree the fruit was harvested from."
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's near trenton come crash it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lmao
