Bill: I don't want to go to work at all, fuck training people.
Nokri (Marisa): oo u up early
Nokri (Marisa): if you have a bunch of helium balloons you can train them to flinch every time you walk by
Bill: I’m usually up at this time.
Bill: And I mixed up timing so I came to the 6:12 train at 5:58 thinking about the 6:58 train.
Bill: WEEEeeeeEEEE
Nokri (Marisa): that means prime train seat WOO
Bill: I’m the second stop on the line. I always get a prime seat.
Nokri (Marisa): spice it up a bit. throw on a doily.
Bill: I could care less.
Nokri (Marisa): airline stewardesses worldwide are gaping in shock
Bill: It’s a train.
Bill: I’m just miserable and have to spend the whole day training the new girl, despite the fact I’m supposed to be the junior dev and I really don’t feel like spending all day pretending like I’m 100% on top of things cause I’m not because this project is a shitshow.
Nokri (Marisa): will a fake mustache help
Nokri (Marisa): it will make you seem wiser
Nokri (Marisa): tom get back here rise and shine bring jess with you
Nokri (Marisa): IT'S STORMING
Nokri (Marisa): i was trying to have a video call but the thunder is too loud and i can't drown it out with anime ;~;
Bill: Y I k e s
Afina (Georgia🍀): SO I HAD A WEIRD ASS DREAM AGAIN
Afina (Georgia🍀): So Leanna was chasing someone down a hallway, and I was helping her catch the person
Afina (Georgia🍀): And at one point I was running faster than Leanna so I caught up to the person
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then I turn around and Leanna is gone and so is this person, and I'm standing on the top of a balcony thing that wraps around the room
Afina (Georgia🍀): And at the front of the room is a TV screen playing random shit
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then the room FILLS with everyone I know, from best friends to con acquaintances
Afina (Georgia🍀): And some people lift me into the air and the screen starts playing old events from my life?
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I ask what's going on and tom says "we're doing this because we care"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I'm like w h a t
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then Spencer, that guy from RTX, goes "we've deemed you to be too judgemental and have to change you"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then everyone starts chanting and I wake up lol
Nokri (Marisa): are you sure that was a dream and not a lit party
Nokri (Marisa): except the change part that may have been a party-induced hallucination
Afina (Georgia🍀): Were you guys all throwing me a party yesterday night? Owo
Bill: sounds like a intervention.
Aldus (Jess): yes, we have to change you, you're too judgemental
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😱
Nokri (Marisa): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah that's exactly what it looked like!
Afina (Georgia🍀): Except with like 200 people
Bill: it is odd having everyone up this early.
Nokri (Marisa): prime party time
Aldus (Jess): im always up this early for work at least
Bill: yeah, but both Hal and Georgia are alive.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm at workkkk
Afina (Georgia🍀): Halim is a complete anomaly
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tho he was asleep pretty quick last night I think
Elfriede (Tom): WERE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE CARE GEORGIA
Bill: *Fuuuuucking* hell, I had to do a thing Friday and I didn't.
Afina (Georgia🍀): AHHH NO SCARY
Afina (Georgia🍀): I guess my dream is telling me in judgmental oops
Bill: Maybe it about Ethan.
Bill: I hate today.
Afina (Georgia🍀): MY JUDGEMENTS ABOUT ETHAN ARE RIGHT THO
Afina (Georgia🍀): speaking of, I was talking to hunter, and apparently I know his ex girlfriend
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like 4 years ago I was like "wow she's annoying and only wants to be cosplay famous that's lame"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And hE CONFIRMED
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i was right all along_
Bill: good for you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): screams casey is just going to texas in 2 months
Afina (Georgia🍀): and no one was invited to her going away party except her friends that ethan likes
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats such a red flaaag
Aldus (Jess): YEA sure is
Bill: Did you talk to her about yesterday?
Aldus (Jess): what is she doing ommmggg
Afina (Georgia🍀): she kept dodging it!
Afina (Georgia🍀): like shes ashamed that ethan isnt letting her invite her other friends
Bill: Which is why you have to pry it from her by showing you don't care what Ethan thinks, and that you're there for her.
Aldus (Jess): thats like abusive relationship 101
Afina (Georgia🍀): like none of her work friends or school friends or cosplay friends were at her going away party
Afina (Georgia🍀): only erik and leanna
Afina (Georgia🍀): like
Afina (Georgia🍀): DOESNT THAT LOOK WEIRD
Afina (Georgia🍀): ugh its driving me insane
Afina (Georgia🍀): and having her at the cosplay meet up was the only chance to talk to her without ethan hovering around
Afina (Georgia🍀): and she kept bristling about bringing it up and ducking her head
Afina (Georgia🍀): like if she wanted to go she would own up to it and be like "this is a good fresh start for me"
Aldus (Jess): did she say she didnt want to go tx in the past?
Afina (Georgia🍀): y e a h
Afina (Georgia🍀): and ethan mustve won her over this time cause hes the only person she talks to
Afina (Georgia🍀): shes like a princess trapped in a tower over at ethans 😭
Aldus (Jess): im surprised he even let her go yesterday
Afina (Georgia🍀): ^^^^^
Afina (Georgia🍀): and thats not normal
Afina (Georgia🍀): imagine if we were saying that about tom or hal???
Aldus (Jess): HA
Afina (Georgia🍀): like "hal wont let me do anywhere" or "tom wont let me invite these people"
Afina (Georgia🍀): LIKE WE WOULD BE SHITTING OURSELVES
Aldus (Jess): i would said bye bye a long time ago
Afina (Georgia🍀): im wondering if i should text her like "whats the deal with such a small going away party"
Aldus (Jess): like just straigh up ask her? yea why not
Aldus (Jess): has she said anything to Rei?
Afina (Georgia🍀): nope nothing to rei
Aldus (Jess): 😦
Aldus (Jess): I thought maybe she would have mentioned something to them since they seem cloise but then again casey seems very private
Afina (Georgia🍀): apparently she told roman that shes miserable just going to school and being a hermit in ethans apartment
Afina (Georgia🍀): and roman was like "are you doing it cause ethan told you to"
Afina (Georgia🍀): and she said no
Bill: Rei said something about 'we can move in together, and then get Alex to come back up'. I dunno if that's wishful thinking or Casey doesn't know.
Afina (Georgia🍀): well alex was caseys best friend til he moved
Bill: You should talk to her. Maybe meet her for lunch at school or something. The car ride to BNE would have been good, but that's in the past.
Aldus (Jess): maybe rei was trying to get casey to see there could be other options
Afina (Georgia🍀): ok im starting off by asking casey if that teeny going away was what SHE wanted
Afina (Georgia🍀): hopefully thatll lead into something
Afina (Georgia🍀): at the least, we can make plans for her to see all her friends for another afternoon
Aldus (Jess): just seems like hes taking her away 😦 and shes just thinking its ok cuz shes"trapped" even though she probably doesnt see it that way
Afina (Georgia🍀): she started typing a response to my text and then stopped
Afina (Georgia🍀): oof that happens a lot
Afina (Georgia🍀): /screams and drives straight into ethans apartment myself to kidnap her
Aldus (Jess): YEA LETS DO IT
Bill: You need to make it clear she has a place with you, unconditionally. No matter what Ethan says does or is. A judgement free friendship.
Aldus (Jess): has she had other boyfriends?
Afina (Georgia🍀): AHAHAHAHA THAT PARTY WAS FOR ETHAN, LEANNA AND ERIK WERE THE ONLY ONES OH BOY
Aldus (Jess): like is she a serial douchbag dater?
Aldus (Jess): CUZ BOI AINT GO NO FRANS
Afina (Georgia🍀): y e a h
Afina (Georgia🍀): ethan leaves in a few weeks, casey leaves in november
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk what to say ahhhhh
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah shes had a boyfriend before this
Afina (Georgia🍀): she was gonna move to tennessee with him actually i think
Aldus (Jess): WHAT THE FUCK
Afina (Georgia🍀): but they broke up when he cheatd on her
Aldus (Jess): D:
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think theres a trend here now that you meantion it
Aldus (Jess): even bigger WTF
Aldus (Jess): yea i kinda thought that might be the case
Afina (Georgia🍀): eTHAN CAN SUCK A NUB
Afina (Georgia🍀): UGH
Afina (Georgia🍀): hes coercing her cause he thinks he knows whats best
Afina (Georgia🍀): and shes not happy
Aldus (Jess): she does seem to be at least
Aldus (Jess): shes trapped in the "hes a d-bag but i love him"
Afina (Georgia🍀): "and im desperate to leave NJ"
Aldus (Jess): ah
Aldus (Jess): y tho?
Aldus (Jess): i mean not saying nj is heaven on earth but just wondering
Afina (Georgia🍀): to prove something maybe
Afina (Georgia🍀): idk shes always been adamant about not staying home
Afina (Georgia🍀): if its a pride thing, i dont get it
Afina (Georgia🍀): she just turned 22 and if it were me i wouldnt really care if i still had to live with my parents for money reasons
Aldus (Jess): do they have a bad relationship or something?
Afina (Georgia🍀): me: "mom did you know that caseys moving to texas with ethan again?"
Afina (Georgia🍀): mom: ugh
Afina (Georgia🍀): i dont think so, i know she LOVES her mom
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think shes sorta neutral on her stepdad
Aldus (Jess): mom knows what up
Aldus (Jess): then why would she wanna move away so bad 🤔
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe she sees that as a step in becoming an adult
Afina (Georgia🍀): which, yeah, moving out is a step
Afina (Georgia🍀): but i think shes maybe taken it to an extreme
Afina (Georgia🍀): its also not really a necessary condition
Aldus (Jess): just mo PA, all the experience of moving to tx, without the distance!
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just dont like casey and ethans instability
Aldus (Jess): yea, hes red flag city honestly
Aldus (Jess): hes got all the makings of abusive, i just hope theres nothing worse going on 😦
Bill: While he’s gone you can talk to Casey and make sure it’s not a bad choice.
Bill: Course we assume it is.
Afina (Georgia🍀): true
Afina (Georgia🍀): i have a month between him leaving and caseys expected departure
Aldus (Jess): where is she going to stay then? his house? her parents?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i guess her house
Afina (Georgia🍀): UGH i hate those relationships where the power dynamic is so skewed
Afina (Georgia🍀): ethan just takes and takes and takes
Afina (Georgia🍀): and he thinks that "giving" is when he respects her boundaries
Aldus (Jess): WTF that should be a give-in. omg i cant stand guys like him
Afina (Georgia🍀): like HE wants to move to texas
Afina (Georgia🍀): its all hes talked about
Afina (Georgia🍀): it looks like caseys gonna come to the halloween party the 27th
Afina (Georgia🍀): and thatll give people a chance to say goodbye
Afina (Georgia🍀): SCREAMS
Aldus (Jess): 😦
Bill: Get together with her one on one.
Bill: Or with Rei and Roman.
Aldus (Jess): yea she isnt going to say anything in front of multiple people
Aldus (Jess): as in liek people she doesnt know well if you get her with a few people that have known he along time that will be better
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah i guess
Afina (Georgia🍀): shes not very communicative over text either
Afina (Georgia🍀): ill see what i can do
Afina (Georgia🍀): in the meantime, its just frustrating
Aldus (Jess): yea 😦
Afina (Georgia🍀): like i feel like its so obvious to everyone that hes controlling
Afina (Georgia🍀): but i guess not
Aldus (Jess): I dont think it straight up obvious, its obvious to her friends that see her and him and the way he acts. Its porbbaly not so obvious to everyone since I think she only tries to show the good stuff to people
Afina (Georgia🍀): probably
Afina (Georgia🍀): shes just naive to so much of it
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~like she likes the blake and adam ship~~
Aldus (Jess): TRUE
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg I can't keep it together at work, I have to keep from laughing, this old guy came in and said "I like those Buicks over there but. I don't want any of those cars made by Jap Nazis"
Aldus (Jess): LMFAO WHAT
Aldus (Jess): i have so many questions
Afina (Georgia🍀): HE SIGNED IN AS "MAGIC" AND NO OTHER NAME
Aldus (Jess): WHAT LMAO
Elfriede (Tom): Hahahahah
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wild, customer service is wild
Aldus (Jess): ok first of all dont you guys only sell GMCs? or at least like mostly GMCs
Bill: https://giphy.com/gifs/upset-shrek-i-think-need-a-hug-qfSGgKRk6GIXS
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no billiam
Afina (Georgia🍀): *virtual hugs*
Bill: thanks.
Bill: Heart hands isn't an emoji.
Bill: That's dumb.
Bill: 💗
Afina (Georgia🍀): Man this Ethan business is shortening my fuse today
Afina (Georgia🍀): I have no tolerance for people bein stupid at work
Bill: I rarely have tolerence for stupidity, so...
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like people just aren't picking up the phone
Bill: That’s a bit short but sure.
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats literally it but thats also my phone job
Afina (Georgia🍀): i call back to their desk, and they say theyre there
Afina (Georgia🍀): but then i transfer the call back and theyve already left their desk
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean theres other stuff bugging me but thats the most pressing
Bill: !
Bill: Can't you use A2 as a hair down Weiss?
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): probably
Bill: That'd be awesome.
Bill: Not that I know what image it was that had me suggest the idea.
Afina (Georgia🍀): we have to upload a photo of ourself to our dorm halls community board or something
Afina (Georgia🍀): is it totally cheating to send in a 1950s georgia photo
Afina (Georgia🍀): cause most these kids got dim-lighting and selfies ahaha
Bill: hehe.
Afina (Georgia🍀): not to mention, is it dorky to participate in dorm hall activities?
Bill: yes, but you're kinda dorky.
Bill: Plus if you play along early, the RA won't bug you.
Afina (Georgia🍀): mmmm trueee
Afina (Georgia🍀): ok so final answer, is it cheating
Afina (Georgia🍀): am i looking TOO good
Bill: I'm partial.
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats ok :V
Bill: Does someone just want us to tell her she looks good? 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nooo I need validation that I won't intimidate the viewers of the wall with my awesome photo coutesy of THE tlt_wm
Aldus (Jess): looks like she already knows to me
Aldus (Jess): who cares? use the pic if you want too lol
Bill: Your good looks are yours and you can be proud of them if you want to. And if some cute girl is like “wow how’d you get such a great photo” you can introduce her to your good buddy. 😏
Afina (Georgia🍀): TRUE
Bill: Not like it would *work* but it made for a good line.
Bill: Ffs. This day won’t end. My snack for the train ripped too much, slipped out of my hand, and all over the floor.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Karma is real
Afina (Georgia🍀): I bought 3 sheets of foam for 2.50 the other day and the lady forgot to bag them
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I went today and somehow got 5 sheets for 50 cents
Bill: Stop taking my luck will you.
