N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m listening to some crime show on TV and the girl said “I found this. I used the Wayback machine. It’s a website for looking at old deleted webpages. Look here. There’s this website called MySpace that says he has a brother.”

Dirty Lego (Tom): This long lost website
Dirty Lego (Tom): I had one
Dirty Lego (Tom): Big oof
Bill: The storm being stronger tonight than this morning makes my decision to call snow day harder to justify... is annoying. But while getting there *wouldnt* be a problem, getting back will absolutely be and being 2 and 1/2 hours away relying on public transit that’s valid.
