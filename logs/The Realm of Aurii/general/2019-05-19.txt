Elfriede Faun (Tom): watching the best episode of little bear
Elfriede Faun (Tom): idk why this episode stood out to me so much as a child, also it set my expectations way too high for the harvest moon. I thought it would always be as big as it was in the show

"Born to Jewish-Polish parents, his childhood was affected by the death of many of his family members during the Holocaust."
The the book series is written by a Canadian woman
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hm the animated series looks pretty different from the books tho, or maybe the series art is just simplified for animation
