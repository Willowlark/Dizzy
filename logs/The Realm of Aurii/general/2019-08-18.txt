Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oops it appears I have slept til noon and still have a headache
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How does one be unlucky enough to wake up with a headache
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Happens to me all the time.
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom gets a headache if he sleeps more that 8 hrs <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Whoa that’s never happened to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I slept like 10 hours tho ye
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Same Tom same
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think it’s some dehydration

Nokri (Marisa): I wish we knew what was consciousness is and how it’s formed. I want to talk to a rock for many years about various subjects and nurture it until it gains sentience and grows into another being and I die and it carries on my legacy to a plant.
Nokri (Marisa): Or maybe it’ll go through a rebellious stage and start a new civil war. That’s life.

El🆓de Faun (Tom): What makes you, you and me me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): **Mememe**
Nokri (Marisa): are plants conscious in the same way we are? cells? mushrooms? do tables have consciousness?
is personality part of your consciousness? if personality can change, does that mean our consciousness also changes in some way? if a person has dementia and believes their life is different, does that alter their actual consciousness or just their brain/personality?
Nokri (Marisa): *answer the questions tom*
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oo the big one so you control your decisions like, your instincts tell you to do one this but you have control over whether you do that thing
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Is that your conciousness controlling your brain?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Or two parts of your brain arguing
Nokri (Marisa): ooo like the fate vs autonomy debate?
or we control everything but is it really us or another side of us that we're unaware of?
Nokri (Marisa): wait i know this
Nokri (Marisa): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I mean more human programming versus youre controll over it
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmaoo
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like decision making really separates us from animals
Nokri (Marisa): *or does it*

El🆓de Faun (Tom): sorry i ran to sssist with poison
El🆓de Faun (Tom): what i was gonna follow up with was
El🆓de Faun (Tom): if we are truley just evolved animals and yet lots of people consider the animal kingdom more pure than ours, like a lion killing a zebra to eat, why is that any better than humans just doing what humans do?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): just thoguhts that have popped into my head at various times
El🆓de Faun (Tom): also woah daddy and muscle academy wack
Nokri (Marisa): very few other species farm animals for food like we do <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Nokri (Marisa): ye!

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wooo!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): GOOD
Nokri (Marisa): i need to come up with some kind of cat keychain design

Nokri (Marisa): pierceless party, pierced people need a special invite to attend
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I've been really thinking about getting my ears pierced lately
El🆓de Faun (Tom): But idk what I'd wear
Nokri (Marisa): i almost bought clip-on earring bases, i think i put them in my cart for next time i make an order since i wasn't sure what i'd make them into
Nokri (Marisa): also i already have some for cosplay somewhere
