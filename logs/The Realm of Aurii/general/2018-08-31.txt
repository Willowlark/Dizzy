Afina (Georgia🍀): //Violent flashbacks to last year
Afina (Georgia🍀): Really though, all my suitemates have been super kind and interested in meeting me
Afina (Georgia🍀): EXCEPT for the one who I'm sharing a bedroom with
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also I wouldn't be annoyed but it took her like 7 hours to check her phone and I _know_ everyone was moving in around noon today
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also I wouldn't be annoyed but it took her like 7 hours to check her phone and I _know_ everyone was moving in around noon today
Bill: Dibs go to those who get there first.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like last year, its less about the room, and more about the fact that it took 7 hours for her to respond
Afina (Georgia🍀): and she didnt respond to the group chat until a day after everyone else did
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i got bad vibes last year and i was right, im getting bad vibes again_
Afina (Georgia🍀): tho the other 4 girls seem nice
Bill: Text isn’t the actual person. Give her a chance when you meet her.
Bill: Butttt... I tend to trust my gut too so... 😂
Nokri (Marisa): who are you
Nokri (Marisa): The only sticker i will ever need. Everything else is redundant.
Elfriede (Tom): ;3
Bill: Doggo also cute.
Aldus (Jess): My old kitty was my Facebook memory today 😭
Nokri (Marisa): that's a nice dog
Aldus (Jess): Lmao I thought it was ironic he was sitting in front of the I love my dog jar when I took the pic
Elfriede (Tom): Ah Tucker..
Elfriede (Tom): Cute but,*what an asshole*
Aldus (Jess): He was tsundere
Elfriede (Tom): That's the best way to describe him
Bill: I can't get rid of the durarara avatar.
Bill: I wish I could update the hairstyle, but I can't imagine using anything else as my icon.
Nokri (Marisa): good because i cant recognize anyone when they change their avatar
i don't even know if that's old tom or a new tom
Elfriede (Tom): Who changes profile icons <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): ***and who are you***
Nokri (Marisa): focus is weird
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): *it makes stuff invisible*
Elfriede (Tom): Woahhh
Elfriede (Tom): Das net
Nokri (Marisa): by utilizing this power of invisibility i can harvest my own reaction images
Nokri (Marisa): the owls are the best because they're the most expressive. others not so much.
owls are the way to go.
Elfriede (Tom): Omggg
Bill: too many people need my attention today. It's friday. I want to basically sleep through work.
Nokri (Marisa): have you tried sleeping through work
Bill: Someone should really take amazon prime from me.
Bill: why would I want hotel rooms via my rewards points when *I could get StArBuCkS?*
Aldus (Jess): ~~y u so salty about starbucks~~
Bill: It's more that it's a stupid rewards program. I got a travel specific card for the perks of 1.5 point redemption on travel through chase.
Bill: Starbucks is a waste of a half point.
Aldus (Jess): maybe thats more useful for someone who deosnt travel as much tho?
Bill: Maaaaybe? But why not buy the starbucks regularly, which nets (in my case) 2% back as points, then apply points to the statement to pay off the starbucks. This way you earn points on the transactions without truly paying for it.
Nokri (Marisa): woah it's september time to go to bed
Aldus (Jess): good night, ill wake you up october 1st
Nokri (Marisa): thank u see u in a month
Bill: There are these luxury hotels I can book with because I have the sapphire reserve...
Bill: But they're really expensive, so... why would I?
Elfriede (Tom): I get it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: https://petapixel.com/2018/08/31/this-couple-shot-70s-themed-engagement-photos/ Excuse we did 50s first.
Afina (Georgia🍀):
