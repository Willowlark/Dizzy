Bill: no matter how much sharpening I do I can't get an old knife as good as my new one.
Bill: sigh.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Biru, did your parents get home yet?
Bill: No... I talked to them a half hour ago, Mom was finally getting off 80 (they closed west bound) and Dad was making his way slowly north.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Damn
Bill: Everyone’s home. Well Katy’s at Erik’s but whatever.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I hope there’s a rebuttal to this called “the case against the case against the case against recasts”
Bill: I think I’m getting sick...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NOOOooo!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): bruh you've been sick u so gnarly dude far out
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): in the hip way
Bill: I’ve been feeling crappy all week, but we’ll see if I can push through to ANYC.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Time to day quill it up
Bill: oh I meant to get airborne when I went downstairs.
Bill: I feel better after a shower, but I haven't been taking care of myself and now that I've noticed it's like 'get with it or you'll get sick'.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if you're trying to get airborne you should go up
Bill: and of course I have a *bunch* of messages of people that need my attention.
