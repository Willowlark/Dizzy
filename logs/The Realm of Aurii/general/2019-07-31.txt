Aldus Larian (Jess): Mornin peeps!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): morning <@!351471675843411978> 🤗
Tikur (Kurtis): Morning!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm surprised how well my latest post is doing considering it's basically just a photo of the RWBY beach towel with the back of four heads poking out and the Kalahari sign in the background
Bill: well. You know instagram, they don't actually like males.
Aldus Larian (Jess): that doesn't exactly explain why a picture of four males would be doing well tho
Bill: The back of four male's heads, wearing wigs that match female characters, the bodies of those males hidden by a towel?
Aldus Larian (Jess): mm yea i guess so
Bill: I usually wake up with a headache, I wonder why that is. Like it's usually mitigated by a shower, but I never wake up like "I feel refreshed".
Aldus Larian (Jess): do u sleep roughly the same amount ever night?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Allergens?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Dust
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If you run your overhead fan but don't clean it often that'll do iy
Nokri (Marisa): Are you drinking enough water
Nokri (Marisa): Ain’t it grand how a bad dream can put you in a long lasting sour mood before the day even starts <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Yeah I usually attribute it to allergies.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): :////
Nokri (Marisa): Do you sleep with the window open? Or are cleaning your room with something you’re allergic to?
Nokri (Marisa): HONDA SAN
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:Shooketh_Honda_San:605590718026874901>
Bill: I'm allergic to dust and my room gets dusty cause of all the STUFF
Nokri (Marisa): Summer cleaning time :vanderwood:
Bill: *Vanderwood route when*
Bill: ~~fuck Saeran after ending~~
Bill: I have my laundry from the con all over the place and I need to do that today. Which hoo boy is a battle against exective disfunction. XD
Nokri (Marisa): If the headaches are ongoing you should see a doctor. It could be connected to your mood.

Do you get headaches when you sit in your room all day?
Bill: Nah, it's definitely allergies.
Bill: If I dust my room later I can find out for sure.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ye!
Bill: I also just mark it up to not being a morning person.
Nokri (Marisa): Be careful. What I thought was just me being a dumb idiot was actually my entire body turning against me and being out of whack possibly leading to death, so it’s better to get these things checked if you’re able to.
Bill: So your confirming you're not a dumb idiot. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): If I wasn’t a dumb idiot I would’ve been diagnosed sooner
Bill: Thank you, don't worry. If I was really worried about it I'd go see my GP.
Bill: nope. If you were a dumb idiot you never would have. Instead you are a precious bean.
Bill: oooh village green had an apartment drop to 1388.
Bill: That's a new low.
Bill: I was going to call about a place in hackettstown too...
Bill: but talking on the phone is bleh this morning.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I want to use the Honda San react on literally everything
Nokri (Marisa): These are so creepy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah they really are
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): pageants are weird
El🆓de Faun (Tom): My sister was in a few really young ones unfortunately
Nokri (Marisa): Hi

Nokri (Marisa): i've never seen a goose like that around here, and then that one was just standing in the middle of like 60 other geese
Bill: This thunderstorm is so close the house is shaking when the thunder booms.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): He's definitely lost
Nokri (Marisa): someone on twitter: randomly replies to my post

Nokri (Marisa): WHERE'D PHOTOSHOP GO
Nokri (Marisa): cosplayers are too strong

Nokri (Marisa): Auto save banzai
Aldus Larian (Jess): I got asked to be a bridesmaid 🎉
Bill: Woo!
Bill: Who? Do we know them?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah she used to be my bff at work before she quit cuz my boss sucks
Aldus Larian (Jess): But we used to have lunch together everyday and talked alot
Aldus Larian (Jess): Kinda surprised I made that much of an impact on her for her to ask me to be in her wedding but it makes me feel good.
Bill: That’s nice!
