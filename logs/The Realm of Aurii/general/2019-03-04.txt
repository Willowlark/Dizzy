N🆗ri (Marisa): Humans and snakes behave pretty differently but in the end we’re all just trying to make a living
N🆗ri (Marisa): we don’t eat our own shed skin, normally.
N🆗ri (Marisa): we use the ground to travel
N🆗ri (Marisa): Snakes and cats are more similar
Warm rocks
Wiggles
Hiss
Them eyes
Curl
Bill: What about sign language.
N🆗ri (Marisa): cats also don’t eat their shed skin though usually they barf that up
Yes cats can learn sign language but snakes? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Humans have sign language that’s neat I guess
N🆗ri (Marisa): paw language
Bill: I think my office decided to go into work anyway? Gord said he was going to armonk at 6am, someone pointed out the whole team at IBM was WFH, then he was like 'head to the office then'.
Bill: This all happened while I was asleep of course.
Bill: I woke up 15 minutes before 9 and spent those 15 minutes catching up on discord, instagram, and facebook.
Bill: ~~our driveway was plowed at 6 but you know. fuck it~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): so I twisted me ankle this morning and now im limping around my office lookin like a foo
Aldus Larian (Jess): and i keep accidentally re twisting it
Bill: wow I'm bored.
Bill: I saw two people had viewed my story, saw Leanna’s icon and a Blake and I was like “wow how bees Leanna and Wish are the only one”. 

It was Rebecca but.
Bill: Oh switch docks are on sale.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the mailman is here

N🆗ri (Marisa): unless the grey fabric is here then that also adds, the itabag?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mysmesssssssssss
Aldus Larian (Jess): those are all good options
Bill: H O O K Y
Bill: But also need a group.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *ive forgotten which mailbox is ours*
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s been over a year oops
Aldus Larian (Jess): Opps
N🆗ri (Marisa): I sent BoJo a text asking but she might be busy so it might have to be hooky by process of elimination owo
I also gotta find the key before the mail guy leaves. Maybe I can just try every mailbox systematically until something works
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know it’s on the north east side so that lowers it down to only 30 mailboxes I gotta try
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just ask the mailbox to reveal itself to you
N🆗ri (Marisa): It is cunning and crafting. Too tricky for me.
Aldus Larian (Jess): True
N🆗ri (Marisa): I opened the front door and an unassembled shelf and three boxes fell on me I’m gonna stay inside now
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): i asked what it was and bojo said packing peanuts and i was like <:lenny:395307171539189760>
and i sent her a picture and she said "oh that's not a shelf it's a murphy bed" <:lenny:395307171539189760>
anyway i'm gonna make Dani's dress this evening <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ommmggg
Aldus Larian (Jess): why is that there
N🆗ri (Marisa): because there's no space in front of the cabinet because that's where the unassembled shelf is <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Dani is all cut out and just needs to be sewn together now but the only machine set up is the bernette and the wire is cut off <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I could like. Pin her together 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): Or try and set up the Nintendo machine again 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): There are literally seven sewing machines and three sergers not in boxes sitting around this room why
Aldus Larian (Jess): you are costume machine woman
N🆗ri (Marisa): Most of them old 
Museum old like these black singers
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOA DAS OLD
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee
I think discord glitched out <:minathink:544567715931750405> 
We used to have a few of the ones built into tables but they were too bulky. We might still have one in storage somewhere, but some of these black ones are neat. One we have was made before electric machines were common and somebody put a big bulky adapter on it so it could be used with electricity it crazy
N🆗ri (Marisa): The plug for the Nintendo is separate from the power cord gaidndbaiyjska
So many machines yet I can’t sew this is murder
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hey y’all tilt worm is doing a cool stream
