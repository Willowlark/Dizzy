Afina Tyndall (Georgia): They‚Äôre pulling interns from all ove
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Weirdly enough, she's probably closer than you are, distance-wise

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's no way to talk to the birthday girl
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg i need to hang that in my suite
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Don't forget the slightly inflated brown balloons hanging from the ceiling
Bill: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/370924922/besm-fourth-edition-big-eyes-small-mouth-rpg Dad sent me this over the weekend, holy shit.
Bill: BESM was the first RPG I ever looked into. Dad had the second edition in the basement for *whatever reason* and being the weeb I am I memorized the book cover to cover.
Bill: I have *never* run it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lol its one letter away form BDSM
Bill: That's what *every single kid* in middle school said.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I never claimed to have a mature sense of humor
Bill: Maturity is overrated.
Bill: It's Big Eyes Small Mouth, since they didn't list it on the graphic.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye i know it says it in the link
Bill: I haven't heard of the game since early 2010's though. I thought it was dead.
Bill: Correction, the third edition was released in 2007.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Big Eyes Small Mouth was my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh card
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): fun birthday drinking games, take a shot every time noah tells me happy birthday again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he told me at nidnight, when we hung up call, this morning, and again in the physics club group chat
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg no u might die
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _viva la 21_
Aldus Larian (Jess): "she made it too her 21 birthday and then died, she blames her bf"
Bill: ~~wait so it's not actually a new edition?~~
Bill: They're charging *alot* for the print editions and it's only a revision?
Bill: It's *90 bucks* for a print copy of fourth edition and the trimmed down version.
Bill: Pretty sure you can get the MM, DM's guide, and player's handbook for 5th edition D&D for that price.
Bill: I should also keep in mind I'm, like 2nd and 3rd edition, probably never going to *play* the game...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nah D&D books are like $50 a piece
Bill: And this book is equivalent to DMG and PHB...
Bill: Fair enough.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Unless you get them on sale or whatever, but list price is 50
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~that's why I haves a pirated PDF copy of the PHB~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): tom and i got out PHB for like 30 on sale
Bill: ~~Dad and I have a library of pirated gaming books~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): but also we chare it
Bill: I need to find pdfs of some of the newer books, actually.
Bill: alright I wanted to get the physical copies but I'm never going to use them, they're pricy, and it's not even an all new version of the game. The PDFs will be fine.
Bill: ,...
Bill: I feel like I want it for the nostalgia but. I think that's the only reason I really want it.
Bill: Oh to be a kid again
Bill: oof there's a 50% off sale for speks.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): fuck "for kids" products
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): did you see the disney article criticizing childless millennials for going to disney
Aldus Larian (Jess): fun is only for kids dont u know?
Bill: who had fun as a kid,
Aldus Larian (Jess): if u didnr have fun then why u wanna go back
Bill: I actually asked myself that after I said it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like now is the prime age
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You have the money and independence to do whatever you wanted as a kid
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Update, change the drinking game to ‚Äútake a shot every time a Paladino wishes me happy birthday‚Äù
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah‚Äôs mom and sister texted me too lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There‚Äôs a kid at the school that wears a hat with a wolf on it EVERY day
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm going through my piles of paperwork and there's shit going back to 2017 I never took care of... oof
