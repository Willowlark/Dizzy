Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah that sounds like a good idea
Bill: I’ve seen that in action. More than that and you just kinda leave stuff there.
Afina (Georgia🍀): wow so geoff is trying to make resin molds and 3d printing a business
Afina (Georgia🍀): and he asked for my advice, and i said that people love replicas of things from in game
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i gave the nuka cola bottles as an example

Afina (Georgia🍀): _3rd degree burns_
Bill: ~~Natural selection at it's finest~~
Bill: I need a third compact flash card for all three of the old cameras to be usable.
Bill: I don’t want to buy a 30 dollar good one though, cause I use XQD and SD.
Bill: But the cheap ones are 2/3s the price of the good ones.
Dave: ~~you hand out those 3 cameras to us so we can take shitty behind the scenes photos of photo shoots~~
Bill: That is, exactly, the point yes.
Bill: For the chestnut hill shoot.
Bill: I just don't want to buy the compact flash card, cause I'll never use it myself.
Bill: my 3300 is my backup, and it uses SD.
Bill: Then do I want to get the 85 dollar bulb for the flash head I got? I have one and I barely know how to use that, nor am I setup to do a studio lighting scenario...
Bill: (The battery pack is portable, but the flash heads have to be mounted somewhere)
Nokri (Marisa): Most cons don’t allow mounted stuff unless you’re in a hotel room so it’d have to be for private non-con shoots
Bill: yup.
Bill: We've been planning more of that.
Bill: I'm sleepy.
Aldus (Jess): im in a weird mood today
Bill: Hopefully not like when I’m in a weird mood.
Aldus (Jess): this morning i was mopey, i didnt sleep well. but i feel pretty good now so thats 👌
Bill: That kind of morning.
Bill: It was gloomy but better now.
Aldus (Jess): YO I WANNA GO SHOPPING
Bill: For what?
Bill: ~~that's a weird mood sure yea~~
Aldus (Jess): everything
Aldus (Jess): except food i hate food shopping f that
Bill: I've been wanting to go up the crossings recently, so I get the mood.
Eliran (Halim): Question of the day
Eliran (Halim): Does Erik tell Ethan my comment 
And does ethan get pissed about me saying he doesn't like me
Bill: 🙄
Bill: stop caring about captain alpha.
Eliran (Halim): I thought about it after sending the message
Eliran (Halim): And was unsure if I should edit it out or not
Bill: own up to the comment, don't go deleting things. It's not a real fix; nothing on the internet can be hidden. Don't dwell on it and if it comes up, it comes up.
Bill: Erik's not looking to start drama, he never is.
Eliran (Halim): I really want to just talk to Ethan and get this stupid dispute settled tho 
We share friends, cosplay communities and everything 
How is this the best way to do things
Eliran (Halim): I know I won't obviously but it annoys me
Bill: It's not the best way, he's a tool and you're letting it bother you.
Bill: Take the high road, be nice to him, let him dig himself in a hole with his attitude.
Bill: The more you try and *fix* him, the more silly you look. Let other people realize, through his actions towards you, that he's not the sharpest tool in the shed.
Dave: Yeet
