Nokri (Marisa): Ya I’m standing tiredly in the rain near a station I think he meant but I’m too delirious to be sure <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sigh Ethan's in Casey's story again
Aldus (Jess): Rest in pieces
Bill: I guess her parents forgive him.
Nokri (Marisa): When is it socially acceptable to give up and go home 🤔 
Maybe he doesn’t have WiFi and didn’t get my text but there’s lots of places with free WiFi around here
Bill: > he gets there after a half hour
> "Have you been waiting long?"
> You, automatically because you're a weeb: "No I just got here too!"
Nokri (Marisa): Tru

Afina (Georgia🍀): He got the big hand
Aldus (Jess): She is in anime

Nokri (Marisa): I’m gonna buy tweezers and if he doesn’t respond after I buy tweezers I’ll just walk home it’s been half an hour
Elfriede (Tom): The token white hair with the big hand character <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): Ooof...
Elfriede (Tom): Maybe he got lost?
Elfriede (Tom): He should msg you then
Nokri (Marisa): Purrhaps?
But why not send a text yeah
Elfriede (Tom): Yukuza got him
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe he doesn’t have WiFi but every convenience store has free WiFi and there’s like one store every 3 feet
Elfriede (Tom): Nothing can be done
Nokri (Marisa): Rip Allen
Bill: rip Allen.
Aldus (Jess): Who's Allen
Bill: Guy from our japanese class.
Bill: World traveller.
Aldus (Jess): Oooo
Nokri (Marisa): I have arrived at the tweezers store. They have more than tweezers.
Aldus (Jess): Is it called the tweezers store? 😮
Nokri (Marisa): Naw it’s called Daiso <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): Do they sell Daisies?

Nokri (Marisa): in my dreams
Nokri (Marisa): i'd ride in on a horse and he'd be really impressed
Nokri (Marisa): remember when hussie had a gofundme to raise $500 to get this painting
good times
Nokri (Marisa): didn't he go to olive garden with the remaining money or was that another time
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): nvm after research i have determined that was not the time he went to olive garden.
he went to olive garden after fans gave him $150 to get a soul portrait from some guy on the internet and instead of doing that he made his own ~soul portrait~ and took the $150 to olive garden
Dizzy: You should choose  try to finish post
Afina (Georgia🍀): !choose league, try to finish post
Afina (Georgia🍀): Dammit Dizzy be an enabler for once
Elfriede (Tom): Isn't that like
Elfriede (Tom): Not okay to do with your fans money
Afina (Georgia🍀): He literally got 3 million funded for a video game
Afina (Georgia🍀): Kinda in the way Bethesda gets its glitches laughed off, while other games don't, hussies stunts mostly get chalked up to his lol so random humor
Nokri (Marisa): ye, he never agreed to it either. they just kind of gave him money and said "you HAVE to get your soul portrait done by this guy" and doing that required having a conversation with him on the phone which he was uncomfortable with. he also hates olive garden tho and he had people vote on what he'd eat in the forums
Elfriede (Tom): Ah that's fine then 👌

Bill: I'm just imagining wearing like... a fleece blanket as underwear.
Bill: I'm not sure if that'd be comfy or weird.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i forgot to pack a toothbrush so i went down to the lobby to buy one
Afina (Georgia🍀): and they didnt have any so i was like ok i guess ill get mouthwash just to survive
Afina (Georgia🍀): and the lady at the counter was like "you dont have to buy this" and handed me a toothbrush, packets of toothpaste, and two mouthwashes
Afina (Georgia🍀): what a life
Bill: Welcome to the south.
Afina (Georgia🍀): southern hospitality is real
Bill: It is. Creeps Katy out, says she could never live there.
Bill: I couldn’t either, everyone walks too slow.
Nokri (Marisa): velvet......................... bikini........................ ew......

Afina (Georgia🍀): So if anything I'll gain weight cause muscle is heavier
Elfriede (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): tom an i have a scale that tells you what percent of you is fat and which is musulce

Bill: > Tom kicks in door, long hair fluttering in random wind
> "I agree!"
> Jess: Swoon.jpg
> ex dissolves due to sheer gay energy
> Tom takes Jess like a fallout 76 hating *M.A.N*.
Aldus (Jess): but dream ex said it would suck too
Bill: *My story is better*
Bill: *even if I forgot the werewolf*
Aldus (Jess): it was a friendly conversation of distaste for fallout76
Bill: thats not what you said before~
Aldus (Jess): whhhaaaa?
Aldus (Jess): the sex was a different dream
Bill: aaaah.
Aldus (Jess): OR WAS IT
Bill: ,...
Nokri (Marisa): What happened what is this where did your morals go

Nokri (Marisa): I’m gonna go cry myself to sleep goodnight
Aldus (Jess): 😮 no dont do that!
Nokri (Marisa): If u like werewolves then epicmafia has werewolves though I’m pretty sure the site got taken down idk if it was restored or not
Aldus (Jess): there were no werewolves tho 😮
Aldus (Jess): biru what were you typing for liek 10 yrs and then stopped?
Nokri (Marisa): I bet it’s a new meme
Bill: I had had another one too... went to a digital world, but not like digimon's. Normal, but with the bright colors of a n64 platformer and every character model had a primary color. When I got there the transfer didn't work right, or there was like a warm up period, but the people already in the digital world basically had to patch my code so I could interact, I was kinda like a ghost. Then the was some kind of mission, which I tagged along on anyway, and one of the people got fired at and I blocked the shot, despite being ghosty. I was unghosty after that, like I was able to fix my own avatar or something. Then I learned you can have three programs installed, which like show on your leg as weird panels. One of which was shot, which I somehow had even though you had to install that? Pretty sure I had garbage anime protagonist trope where I had all the programs installed even though thats not possible, and I'd need to unlock it.
Nokri (Marisa): Oh
Nokri (Marisa): omg biru is an isekai character
Aldus (Jess): 😮
Aldus (Jess): did u have a harem too?!

Bill: Yeah. Probably cause they aren't looking for the 'get lit' crowd.
Aldus (Jess): OH A BAR
Aldus (Jess): called the laundromat
Bill: Speakeasys are real cocktail bars, it's where you see super cool bartenders and get really fancy drinks.
Aldus (Jess): i was like wtf?? your old enough to drink but not do laundry wtf

Bill: Hi where does *bar* and *coldstone* meet in the middle?
Aldus (Jess): thats the bar tom wants to go to
Bill: He actually wants to go to the sushi bar.
Aldus (Jess): ooo that too
Bill: There's two craft beer places on the same street.
Aldus (Jess): neato!
Bill: So on basically one block, theres 2 Craft Beer places, a Steakhouse, a Nightlife Bar, two fancier bars, two american style resturant bars, a sushi bar, and the cocktail bar. Then if you walk to the other side of the green, there's an irish pub, a dive bar, or the karaoke place on the other corner.
Bill: The only thing Morristown doesn't have is a dedicated whiskey bar.
Bill: oh, or a rooftop I guess.
Bill: That's probably a manhattan thing though.
Aldus (Jess): that sounds pretty coo though
Bill: rooftop?
Aldus (Jess): all
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: Me and Dave still going.
Aldus (Jess): yea i know
Aldus (Jess): your sister going?
Bill: Didn't remind her. She's apparently kinda done with drinking these days, cause Erik can't drink due to stomach issues.
Elfriede (Tom): Isn't she not old enough to
Bill: Katy is...
Bill: ...
Bill: 22?
Elfriede (Tom): Yee
Elfriede (Tom): I mean for the 23 place
Bill: Oh good point.
Elfriede (Tom): Whew no drinking party
Elfriede (Tom): I'll invite JESSE
Bill: Rip your ear drums.
Aldus (Jess): Jesse?
Bill: I don't think Katy really cares much, so.
Bill: Gabel.
Elfriede (Tom): THE TUKEY KONG OFC
Aldus (Jess): he would never XD
Bill: he said *no* drinking party.
Aldus (Jess): wait but wasnt erik drinking the other day?
Aldus (Jess): OOOO
Bill: He *can*, he's just got a stomach as bad as Katy.
Aldus (Jess): ooo
Bill: Pretty sure Katy doesn't want to drink alot around my parents/me. Even in college she'd come home and have a beer, rather than the hard stuff she'd bring back from school.
Aldus (Jess): ye
Aldus (Jess): im the opposite lol
Bill: I obviously drink plenty, hell, usually more with Dad.
Bill: to each their own.
Aldus (Jess): yea ive been drinking a little too much the past few weekends so im dialing it back

Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah it's easy but it's just finding the time to write so much lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): I have to write a letter from one Greek hero to another
Afina (Georgia🍀): And a criticism of a myth
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then when I do the final I got the A IN DA BAG
Bill: you'll just write Afina talking to her Dad, and then criticize the one Pyrrha dies in.
Elfriede (Tom): sleeping through cacr rides is the **best**
Afina (Georgia🍀): I COULD WRITE ABOUT AFINAS DAD
Aldus (Jess): I can't sleep in the car unless I'm exhausted
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye it can fuck up your neck

Dave: I don't mind driving, doubt I'll drink tooooooo much
Dave: <@184437198865563648>
Bill: I'd still end up driving to you though.
Dave: Unless you want me to pick you up
Bill: You really want to do 15 minute loop backwards tho?
Dave: Won't be an issue for me
Bill: If you want to do that, or I can come to you. Need to visit the leather shop right in the area before 6, so get there between 5:30 and 6 or so?

Aldus (Jess): you can also get one on your *lawnmower*
Bill: #sussexcounty
Bill: ~~tbh Brandon probably has been pulled over on a tractor~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): someones gotta ask him lol
Bill: Anyone got a friend with a boat not in kentucky? After riding the water taxi the other week I'd dig hanging out on a day cruise.
Aldus (Jess): uhhh like hoe big?
Aldus (Jess): i mean my uncle has a speed boat but its p.smol
Bill: rip.
Dave: 20 mins from my house, give or take
Bill: kk.
Aldus (Jess): friends of my sister in law have them but that would be hard to get
Aldus (Jess): and then her family has one but its in VT if they still have it
Afina (Georgia🍀): they can be rented i believe
Afina (Georgia🍀): thats usually only pontoon boats tho
Aldus (Jess): yeeee
Aldus (Jess): need a boating licence tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): jet skis can be rented too! im good at those
Bill: pfft I tried jet skis once.
Bill: I was terrible.
Afina (Georgia🍀): do you? i thought you aged into it, and if youre too young a boating license replaces it
Bill: got sea weed in the propellers.
Aldus (Jess): def need one in NJ
Afina (Georgia🍀): bill youre prob thinking about wakeboarding, thats when they pull you behind a jet ski or speed boat
Aldus (Jess): "For any power motorboat operation on tidal waters, you must successfully complete a boating safety course approved by the New Jersey State Police (NJSP) to receive a New Jersey Boating Safety Course Certificate. Visit the NJSP Marine Service Bureau website for full details. You must be at least 16 years old."
Bill: PFFT
Bill: Girl, I can't wake board.
Bill: Jet ski.
Bill: Still, do any of us actually know to p...pilot? a boat?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i got a boating license at 13.................... for kentucky
Bill: *never mind*
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ah that sent upside down dang
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Anyways if the standards are similar, it should be as easy as taking an online course and then paying 10 dolla for the license itself
Aldus (Jess): you could prob get one p. easy
Bill: ~~ye I wanna drink on a boat not drive one~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye its easy shit
Afina (Georgia🍀): bigger boats have the right of way, legally you have to stay such and such feet away from a barge, starboard and port and bow and stern
Afina (Georgia🍀): its not bad
