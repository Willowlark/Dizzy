Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): isn't it wild when you realize that you've been marketed to?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I buy things based on design all the time and its like the "congratulations, you played yourself" thing cuz im literally sitting there like "I know y they picked this font and color and boyo did it work!
Nokri (Marisa): someone will see this and go “*yes.* that’s so *me*”
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH GOD 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont even know where to start here
Nokri (Marisa): Does that tick all the design and color boxes for you?

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *yes*. that's so *me*"
Aldus Larian (Jess): at least it half accurate for you XD
