Greg l should’ve let you know a long time ago that’s really messed up.
Bill: It’s okay I do that all the time and look at me.

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): find out next time
Bill: You will not you have cosplay to work on.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Cosplay can be made at night, most of my costumes were created between like midnight and 7am
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m torn between wanting window seats or aisle seats for my upcoming bus rides. Window seat would be cool to look out of, but if it’s 12+ hours I don’t want to bother people if I have to use the bathroom so aisle seat would be better
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Both
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Pls let me have a row all to myself thx
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’ve got a window seeeeeat
But the curtains are shuuuuut so I can’t see a thing
But at least there’s a power outleeeeet yeah I can use that there’s one in each seat
If no one else shows up in 7 minutes I get the row all to myself. Fingers crossed.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alriiight
Full row to myself so I don’t have to bother anyone <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
There are a lot of people on this bus but they’re mostly guys and the bus company has a policy of not seating women next to men on overnight buses. So SWEET empty neighbor chair.
Bill: I’m either getting a much deeper and more dream prone sleep from the new bed, or I just spent the night in fever dreams cause of my head.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): It could be because you’re not yet used to it and you just rearranged your room so your body doesn’t feel wholly ready to fully fall asleep in a “new” area
Bill: Possibly. Really could be getting sick though.
Bill: God, everything is backed up today.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Use laxatives
Bill: *well that took a dark turn*

Bill: Should have took a picture for the gram.
Bill: Everything I've read or listen to seems to be commenting to some emotional problem or another I've had recently.
Bill: Kinda scary.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): That's how it be
Bill: well... how it be is usually 'this reminds of this which makes me sad'.
Bill: I mean the commentary is like 'this is palatable advice you could apply to your problem, and a good mental state to be in'.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ah yes that is a different story
Bill: right?
Bill: Hope it sticks.
