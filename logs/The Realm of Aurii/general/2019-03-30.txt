Bill: My media center rig is fantastic for being sick tbh.
Bill: Steam, ps3/4, switch, Netflix, my entire media server...
Bill: Barely have to move to access anything.
Bill: ~~Also would be great for that Netflix and chill still night in damn~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just went back to the gym
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have much pain
Bill: It’s so nice out and yet I’m going to go home and go to bed fuck this.
Bill: Sugar free Hershey’s (which is like no carb) is cheaper at cvs yeet.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Gives me da poops
Bill: These aren’t aspertine so they good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Other types of fake sugars give me the poops too.
Bill: Oooh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Actually aspertame doesn't gave me the shits oddly enough I
Bill: Sugar alcohols hasn’t bothered my stomach.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Xylitol!
Aldus Larian (Jess): That gives me the pooos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I had a dream that I was adopting this really friendly, quiet white dog
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Internet says that that type of dream means that the people around you have honest and pure intentions towards you
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cute!
Bill: Saw on reddit you can go into a humane society shelter for animals and volunteer by socializing ie playing with da cats/doggos.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeet
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): rutgers: plz take this survey so we know what students think of rutgers
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _survey is 76 pages long_
Bill: You hear a fact, go “naaaaah” and then 3 months later you’re like “fuck it was true” and get disappointed.
Bill: That whole most people lose 2 pounds a week of dieting? Totally true. Kinda was hoping it was bullshit.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the what?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ive never heard that fact
Bill: Average people lose weight is 2 pounds a week.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh why were you hoping it wasnt true?
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's 8 pounds a month, 80 pounds in 10 months
N🆗ri (Marisa): any more and it'd probably be dangerous
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and thats probably without proper sleep and exercise
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): getting both probably boosts the number
Bill: Yeah it's healthy to lose weight at a slower speed, but generally the human body only drops 2 pounds a week. Getting more than that is finicky.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): idk rei was eating pretty healthy over the summer and wasnt budging with weight
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but then she did hardcore ab work outs for 3 weeks and dropped 10 pounds and got shredded
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): everyones body is different like that
Bill: Yup. I doubt Rei has much fat on her to begin with though.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): rei from math class not rei from cosplay lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): uhmmmm yeah which makes it all the more impressive
N🆗ri (Marisa): rei from nge
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): with exercise, you lose fat exponentially
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its easier to lose 10 pounds in the first month than it is in the last week of exercising
Bill: that's generally.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): what do you mean generally?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Everybodys body is different but excersice is never a *bad* idea unless you have a heart condition nor something like that
Bill: Even with diet, you lose quickly at first and it evens out.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The bigger you are the faster you lose with diet OR excersice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ✨ or both ✨
Aldus Larian (Jess): But do both and you'll lose faster
Bill: Ye. While I was at the doctor for *sick* I asked about what else to do, specifically muscle training is the exercise to do.
Bill: Cause muscles eat fat cells (since I ain't eating carbs for them to use) doing that.
Bill: My *plan* was to get to the gym this week but oof to that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye boi
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye gym good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): gym healthy, gym makes the happy hormones release, gym has girls
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): no downsides
N🆗ri (Marisa): be careful working out with no carbs
N🆗ri (Marisa): don't pass out
Bill: "Gym has girls" cute.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and muscle weighs a lot so if you're working out and your weight isn't decreasing as fast as you want it to, maybe that's because the fat is turning to muscle
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 😑
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): gym does have girls
Aldus Larian (Jess): As long at you have enough other micro nutrients you be ok 
I recommend getting a body composition scale if your worried about weight being skewed by muscle
Bill: It *does*, you aren't wrong.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): honestly what really matters is how you feel your pants fit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): weight is ~~a physics thing~~ skewed by a lot of stuff so
Bill: Ye, actual numbers don't matter.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I mean getting down to it all that matters is how YOU feel about your body
Bill: yup.
Aldus Larian (Jess): *steps on scale right after saying this*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): call me weird but im mchurtin from the gym yesterday
Bill: Why's that weird.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i didnt finish typin oops
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its like a satisfying hurtin
N🆗ri (Marisa): masochist
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like _ye bois im hurtin im gettin swol_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I DONT WANNA BE IN PAIN im just satisfied knowing the pain is from gettin shredded
Bill: Technically your muscles getting taxed but shredded yeah.
Bill: Nah, not weird. Same thing.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like i tried racquetball and i sucked at it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i dont like doing things im bad at oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but it was fun learning the techniques and everything
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): like its really different from tennis cause you like... kinda fire the ball with your hip strength more than your arm
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and i was like HA BULLSHIT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but then i tried it and i was like..... damn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its been an hour im still taking this survey
N🆗ri (Marisa): if it's taking that long they should give you course credit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it took an hour phew
N🆗ri (Marisa): half of discord just died for a minute <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo's been asking what i want for my birthday and amazon has kiddy keyboards that are ~$40 and idk if that's too expensive but maybe i could take it to cons with me and try not to get kicked out of the lobby
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why would u get kicked out?
Bill: "kiddy"?
N🆗ri (Marisa): jammin' on a keyboard in the lobby <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH
Aldus Larian (Jess): That kind of keyboard
N🆗ri (Marisa): piano cat cosplay time
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): now that neko atsume has died down in popularity i wonder how much the aprons cost
N🆗ri (Marisa): o surprisingly still expense
N🆗ri (Marisa): *oh but it comes with the shirt*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg cuteeee
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know you are but what am i
Aldus Larian (Jess): Cute
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know you are but what am i
N🆗ri (Marisa): for some reason i bought a piano book in japan so it'd be neat to be able to use it
Bill: that is an adorable outfit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and then since it's kiddy i could give the keyboard to my nephews
ye!! there's 3 kinds we can all match!
Bill: *no*
Bill: I appreciate cute outfit, I do not *be* the cute outfit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but that's gap moe
Bill: what now?
N🆗ri (Marisa): gap moe
N🆗ri (Marisa): y'know
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): gap moe
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ya Gap moe
Bill: I actually don't get it.
Bill: But.
Bill: I am decidedly too much a of loser to be Miyamura.
Bill: He's *goals*
N🆗ri (Marisa): *gap moe*
when someone does something they wouldn't ordinarily do!!
like, jumin the CEO-in-line of Korea's biggest company. the unfeeling robot who only sees things logically. cross stitching in his free time.

hori likes when miyamura is a bad boy and mean to her because it's so gap moe
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's the top definition on unban dictionary I'm not even lying
N🆗ri (Marisa): *that's gap moe, baby!*
Aldus Larian (Jess): The other definition is about jumin too bless
Bill: Hori just kinda a masochist.
N🆗ri (Marisa): seven made those urban dictionary posts
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Next Jumin shoot will be me passing Neko Atsume
N🆗ri (Marisa): jumin trying and struggling to get the ninja cat to complete his collection
N🆗ri (Marisa): man. what do you think it's like for someone who doesn't know of death to witness someone's death. that's tragic.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how long would a person wait for them to move again. what's the point where they give up  waiting for some kind of response.
N🆗ri (Marisa): or is there some kind of inherent biological aspect of us that knows what death is and accepts it
N🆗ri (Marisa): freaking romance is on hiatus now and might be on hiatus for a long time but there are already so many other webtoons on hiatus nooooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): mm. incense really puts you into a ghibli mood where you have to clean everything spotlessly and make a wholesome dinner.
Bill: DO IT
Bill: Mood: watching snafu cause hikigaya is a mood.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i want to. i wiped down the counters but i don't want bojo to get mad if i move anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): The jar of jam really ruins the smoke aesthetic
Bill: Blame totoro.
Bill: 
Bill: Hikigaya is SUCH a mood at all times.
Bill: Wow. One of the opening things they do is tell a girl not to match others and do what she wants, hold her ground. 

I just read an entire book that explored the topic that’s not anime and even academic.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i made a graphic myself for a physics article im doing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its so simple but im so proud because i have no idea what im doing lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _simple_
Bill: Good job.
Bill: I need 20 minutes of energy cause there’s clean laundry EVERYWHERE and I really want it put away and to clear my desk.
Bill: Come on old ~~body~~ buddy old pal...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): my only goals today were to survive work, write a physics article, and email a professor about her research
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so far so goooooo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): do i make a physics joke in writing this physics woman an email
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): she seemed very lighthearted and friendly but also do i risk it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was emailing her about the quark gluon plasma which is basically when the universe used to be so hot that everything existed in soup form
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And i was emailing her the question "3. Which universities are hot beds (haha) of activity for studying the quark gluon plasma right now, from both a theoretical and experimental standpoint?"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _do i include the haha, is it funny enough_
N🆗ri (Marisa): haha
N🆗ri (Marisa): replace the haha with finger guns emoji
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i could also say pun intended

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): emailed the professor, wrote the article, now to sit in anxiety while i wait for her to answer
Bill: Well that seems dumb.
Bill: It’s an email. Fire and forget.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im struggling with the forget part
N🆗ri (Marisa): how about refreshing every 5 seconds until you get a response in several hours to days
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _genius_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im just nervous cause this woman is the back up plan for research this summer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so if all the places reject me shes like plan Z
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i really **really** dont want to be working at the dealership instead of getting valuable research experience oof
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Gasp two of the smart kids in physics added me on Facebook
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): In the span of like one hour
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Does that make me smart now
Bill: Or Noah is talking about you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _even worse_
Bill: Then ~~perish~~ suffer.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And it was fun to shoot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm chuckling to myself thinking about that video
Bill: Not very good. Definitely have to improve the boudoir shooting. Too much in the frame, for mm and 3cp0.
Bill: Me, talking about moving out (random ideas) this week:
Also me, can’t cook more than an omelette:
