N🆗ri (Marisa): Never heard of it but it has good reviews :0
Does it last a long time? It’s like $10
Bill: Lol Kurtis works as an eye tech.
Bill: He a pro.
Bill: At eyes.
Bill: Eye guess.
Bill: :pew
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:woah:543194447345876998> 
Eye didn’t know that omg
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sensei
Tikur (Kurtis): 👀
Tikur (Kurtis): 😎👉👉 Yee they last a bit, and they don't sting horribly like some drops do
N🆗ri (Marisa): Arigathanks gozaimuch I’ll order them if my eye is still in pain by Saturday
Tikur (Kurtis): What kinda eye pain you having?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think it's because i keep scratching my eye, and that makes the pain worse, and that makes me want to scratch it more
and i keep blinking it a lot (everyone here can tell you the eye twitches and makes me wink at people a lot). it's not dry at all, just irritated and it's mostly the one eye. sometimes i see flashes of light in the eye, usually in the mornings. maybe i'm sleeping on it too much and that's causing irritation?
every doctor i've been to in the past though says it's absolutely fine <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N🆗ri (Marisa): like itchy almost but just irritated
N🆗ri (Marisa): *idk eye feeling aaa*
N🆗ri (Marisa): it can't possibly be from staring at screens all day long
Tikur (Kurtis): Uhhhhhhhhhh, definitely sounds like severe dryness.  But are you seeing any floaters or specks in that one eye?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah i have floaters and specks in both of my eyes <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
doctors in the US and Japan were like "that's fine"
Tikur (Kurtis): Okay, have you had an increase in them this week?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was freaking out thinking my retina was detaching for ages, last i was told i just have a very thin retina? like it's fine and healthy and she monitored it for a few months with regular check-ups but it's just thin and very sensitive

no increase that i've noticed sensei
Tikur (Kurtis): Okay, also how often have you been getting flashes?
N🆗ri (Marisa): they come and go, about a week this time around. last time was last year.
when i was in japan they happened for a while and got pretty bad after around 2 weeks which is when i looked into eye doctors in japan but then went away another couple of weeks later
N🆗ri (Marisa): how much do i owe you for this consultation
i have spicy fruit roll ups
Tikur (Kurtis): Consult is free my fren, and tbh with all the symptoms and the newness of the flashes this time I'd say you may wanna follow up at an opthalmologist.  Cause thin retina and floaters spook me a little ngl.
Bill: ~~Marisa you should get to Kurtis/my Mom’s office if you can make the trip~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa, do you have insurance?
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank u i will shower with the fruitiest of roll ups
i've always had floaters and i always complain about it to doctors but they're like "lol ok"
do you recommend the regular dry eye thermatears or the OMEGA-3 fancy ones
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol no
N🆗ri (Marisa): technically i do but it's inaccessible right now
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ok yeah I assumed
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no!  Why? 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's being held ransom
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I’ll ask Mom later if there’s anything that can be done.
N🆗ri (Marisa): not lasik pls that's so scary
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~is it under your dad?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): yuuuup
court ordered health care provided by him because BoJo and I work odd jobs/multiple freelance and part time jobs that don't come with health care
he won't give us our insurance cards or healthcare info and we can't afford our own, he says he'll give it to us if we meet with him but he's been saying that for years and when we met with him in the past he didn't give it to us
N🆗ri (Marisa): japanese health insurance was great
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh the omega-3 thing is a pill ew
i don't wanna consume the eye pill
Tikur (Kurtis): Regular theratears are good 👌 I'm just concern about flashes and floaters fren ☹️
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank u for ur concern 🙏 never fear, vision is an illusion and i can barely see anyway <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
theratears are $12.44 but Bravely Second is $16.55 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i can buy you da eye drops mawisa~~

N🆗ri (Marisa): oh bad it has bad reviews
Aldus Larian (Jess): Plz take care of eye first

N🆗ri (Marisa): guests might be allowed, i'm asking bojo if she wants to go and i see there's a section for guests but no details are available on that until the alumni confirms they're going
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd take my nephews but i think they're too young to really enjoy a museum, even a kid-oriented one like that
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's gonna be a saturday in may though it might be absolutely packed with regular attendees hmm <:thinku:543194478614413318>

N🆗ri (Marisa): I was on the third floor looking for fabric and started seeing spots and having trouble breathing so I’m taking a fabric hunting break on the second floor
Andrew: Take care of the heat
Andrew: pls
N🆗ri (Marisa): Fabric tho
Andrew: The fabric isnt going anywhere
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s probably hotter on the third floor than it is outside because the heat gets trapped in and it’s super humid
Andrew: Yes it does and is
N🆗ri (Marisa): Idk man stuff winds up in weird spots a lot
Andrew: Which is a bad thing for you in there
Andrew: But youll always find it again
N🆗ri (Marisa): I only came down here because Sylvia was following me around and I was worried about her
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’ll take MONTHS to find it again <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Andrew: Im in a ttic rn so i always have to be hot
Aldus Larian (Jess): i freeze all day at work untill the sun comes around my side of the building
N🆗ri (Marisa): the key is to look for something else
