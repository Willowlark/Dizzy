Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  biru just said that I Tom as much as you love Yona
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Wow you must have a lot of tom merch too
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): thinking of making a yona shrine when back in the US, if only because I have so much Yona junk now.
the last otakon I went to they were selling the first manga with a limited edition postcard set but when I went to check it out i already had that postcard set it was the freebie from an issue of hana to yume I had already bought in japan.

ironically i don't have any official animate goods or such because *they're only sold at limited edition events and are impossible to find* but I have a ton of the recent furoku. maybe when I have time I can go hardcore hunting for stuff in junk shops.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): also no doujinshi rip
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): some doujinshi.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I saw a Yona art today and thought of you
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): YONA
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): what art was it
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): fanart or official
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): deets
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Fanart! It was pretty good but yonas hair was more like orangy? ðŸ˜®
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): orange yona orange yona aaaaaa
i really dig how they cut her hair on-stage at the play. the hair cutting scene and the crossdressing scenes i was looking forward to, and though they didn't make kija crossdress they did add a funny scene with Shin-ah trying to be girlu
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): man irl shin-ah is really freaky. the comics and anime just don't portray how incredibly awkward a dude silently standing there doing nothing is. but there he is. and it's marvelous.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Shin-ah is precious
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm glad he's a hit for the stage play. I like him
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): yeah!! pretty sure the girl next to me was a shin-ah lover because she only raised her binoculars when he was on stage
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): and she kept gasping when he showed up
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OMG ~~was it me~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): he wore the mask 99% of the time he was on stage and talked about how difficult it was to see out of it. good actor boi.
they also released little interviews with them all!
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): https://youtu.be/Ahc0AxjS3yA?t=92
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): ~~i fast-forwarded it to shin-ah~~
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): I was wondering if they made his hair blue or not, i guess they really did. it was hidden behind the fluff the entire time
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): actually i think shin-ah was like the only one not to collapse on-stage. kija fainted, hak fainted, zeno keeled over a few times, jaeha was knocked down, yoon got messed up, yona grovelled, but shin-ah was fine lol
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i wanna know how they attached their wigs.
wigs that stay on perfectly fine and maintain their styles despite doing flips and rolling across the ground. Jaeha was upside down for a while wrapped around an enemy and his wig  didn't budge a bit. how they do that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea WTH is that magic
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I wanted to jump into a plushie pit today but I knew my wog would get messed up
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): Not a ball pit?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Plushiiieesss
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): an extra hour in the plushie pit
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): i considered pre-ordering the DVD but there wasn't a set price for it yet so i was like "nah"
because i really want to see those flips again. jaeha straight up wrapped himself around the one guy like a pole and then the guy flipped him upside down and then at one point he backflips onto the stage from like 8 feet up. *and the wig didn't budge.*
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): tae-jun grovelling on the ground and rolling around pathetically but his wig still perfect
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): moving to anime to praise the play more because golly ðŸ¤˜
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's amazing I need whatever they are using for wigs
Bill: Speaking of... two sources for pre styled.

Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): Damn they doing a ton of acrobatics too?
Bill: Iâ€™ve never heard of the latter site, but I think thatâ€™s the one the hero suit lumillion had.
Chicken Elfriede(o) (Tom): On top of the acting
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): YEAH it was like a circus. you could tell jaeha (who had the most movement cuz of his high kicks) was super out of breath but he was a pro at maintaining his cool and casual composure. 

hak was exactly like the anime with his wooshing the naginata around and twirling it. shin-ah's swordplay is super flashy and kija kept striking dramatic poses while fighting. they would jump and climb around and stuff. hak fell off a cliff twice but the first time he climbed back up.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I like the second one biru
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): OH there were a hilarious scene where Tae-jun is like "Don't you know who I am??? I'M THE FIRE TRIBE GENERAL's son" with the son part being super quiet and rushed.
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): oo those are good prices
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg I wanna see this even tho I can't understand anything
No(kri) goin' back now (Marisa): if the price isn't too bad i'll get the DVD. i have the first play already we can watch owo
