秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): No ones in the seat next to me either yehaw here we go
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Beautiful
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): The ride back to Tokyo next week will be meh because no outlet to charge my phone, no baggage space (I’ll crush myself with my bag) and since it’s a night trip the curtains will be closed, but the bus is spaces so seats are in 3 rows and you don’t have anyone next to you.

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): The Instagram story deletion of shame

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Clouds from above are scary I don’t recommend. So spooky.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Look like dragons
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Actually today is more viewing clouds from the side. Diagonally perhaps. Straight down would be freaky.

Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): did you see mine?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): WHAT
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): No it said no answers and the only people who answer my questions had all seen it so I deleted it because there were no answers :0
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Regret
~~can I ask what you said~~
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m mad at Instagram because apparently this isn’t the first time I hadn’t received messages
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I bet someone said weeb energy if anyone else responded. Now I’m so confused because I can’t find a reason why answers wouldn’t show up. Reportedly I’ve gotten only half the responses to other stuff and my app is fully updated.

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ok everyone except one other person got off the bus so now it’s kind of awkward and I hope that other person is also staying on until the last stop because it’ll be really weird being the only one on this fancy bus aside from the driver
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Nope they got off at the next stop. Aaaawkward.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m the only one at my hotel tonight. Literally. All the staff go home and the one guy who was there when I arrived was like “here’s the password for the door lock, you’re our only booking tonight lol”
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): It’s simultaneously awesome and freaky
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Hope I don’t get murdered.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Ok yeah place is huge and maze-like and eerily silent it’s super freaky. I have a TV at least but it’s so quiet I feel I should also be quiet. Someone come party with me.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Omg that's cool and Terrible
