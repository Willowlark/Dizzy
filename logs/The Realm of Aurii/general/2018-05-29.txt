Afina (Georgia🍀): Thanks I tan
Eliran (Halim): Is it just me or do that guys legs look ducked up
Nokri (Marisa): they look squished a bit
all their legs seem odd but yours are probably because of the pants hal
Aldus (Jess): Georgias not a guy silly
Nokri (Marisa): homo sapien without the homo
Nokri (Marisa): omg do you watch the twilight zone
imagine a To Serve Man scenario where there's an alien/demon at a restaurant
"yes I would like one homo sapien please but hold the homo, i'm allergic"
Nokri (Marisa): "that's not how it works"
"how dare you. i want to talk to a manager"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: MARISA WHAT
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: HOW DOES YOUR MIND WORK
Nokri (Marisa): what
it's a logical train of thought
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 😱 😱 😱
Nokri (Marisa): did you know cannibalism is naturally discouraged because if you eat things of your own species you'll grow holes in your brain
Nokri (Marisa): not just humans, other animals too. idk about insects though maybe not them
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Woahhh, all I know is that in fallout when people each human meat they develope "The shakes"
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH THAT'S IT TOO
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: WOW THANKS FALLOUT❤
Nokri (Marisa): your neurons die and make holes in your brain and it impairs stuff like motor skills so you shake, and makes you insane
Aldus (Jess): 😭😱
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That's a fantastic info 👌
Nokri (Marisa): you should stop that cannibalism habit you guys are developing <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I will now be more discouraged from eating people
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): wouldn't it be neat if there were two dominant species on earth
how do we get the octopi to communicate
Nokri (Marisa): by dominant i mean equally intelligent on the way humans conceive intelligence to be
Aldus (Jess): Yea!
Nokri (Marisa): this is a conversation better suited for 4am
BUT YEAH
Aldus (Jess): I've thought about that before too
Nokri (Marisa): we can do it we just need octopi to do stuff
Aldus (Jess): But wouldn't the octupi have to stay in the water? And we'd be on land? So we really wouldn't live together
Nokri (Marisa): tru
but we have wetsuits and divers
and fishtanks and stuff
if verbal communication is impossible through that method because our speech gets garbled underwater then written would be best, or sign language
oh but then territorial disputes oh no
Aldus (Jess): So many factors to consider
Nokri (Marisa): we need another gef
Nokri (Marisa): if gef was real we could have gotten so much
bring on other some other nth dimensional buddies
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: I feel like we'd def be segregated and warring occasionally but obv the octopuses can't fight us on land and we can't really fight them in water sooo
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Wed prob live separately and maybe set up trade
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Some wierd love story's when the species mix
Aldus (Jess): ~~the shape of water~~
Nokri (Marisa): irl krakens owo
~~you beat me to the punch~~
Aldus (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina (Georgia🍀): What interesting things to learn
Nokri (Marisa): pluto is smaller than russia
Nokri (Marisa): supposedly. some say it's a little bigger. but roughly the same size.
Nokri (Marisa): i can't believe russia is pluto.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 🤔

Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ah yes first thing I wanted to do this morning... Auto parts store
Nokri (Marisa): kid in my class trying to make a point: "when you text your friends you always type whatever and let autocorrect do its work, right?"

no dude I have to go back and painstakingly re-do the art that i've typed because autocorrect changed it. i want my words spelt bad that's Aesthetic.
the only good autocorrect is Flying Spaghetti Monster's capitalization
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 😱
Bill: Snrk.
Bill: _assumes your anniversary plans are finishing the hammer Tom needs to start being a girl_
Bill: That bit writes itself.
Bill: The IBM interns are getting toured about.
Nokri (Marisa): commence rapid dabbing
Bill: This guy from another team is explaining the project I work on to his intern.
Bill: He makes it sound so much less of a mess than it is.
Nokri (Marisa): make eye contact and don't break it under any circumstances

Afina (Georgia🍀): Nederoids are the only figurines I like usually tbh
Afina (Georgia🍀): I know a smol Nenderoid Mami figurine
Bill: ye, I only have two now, but normal figures tend to make me feel like the creep I look like.
Aldus (Jess): They usually don't make figures for things I like and if they do they arnt good looking
Bill: I've got two good smile chibis too, Tohsaka Rin and Yukari... Then a nenodroid and actual figure for Natsume Rin.
Bill: Which I realize now I'd much rather have Natsume Kyousuke as a figure, but lol figures of male characters.
Bill: ~~I'm not this guy okay~~
