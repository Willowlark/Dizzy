Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah it's not anime
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedApron

The trope's popularity comes originally from the pin-ups American soldiers brought with them during World War II; a common motif were titillating shots of women in otherwise normal domestic situations, such as cooking or cleaning. These pinups were emulated by Japanese artists around the same time Manga began to develop as an art form in the years after the occupation of Japan (1945-1960). In Japan this trope is called "Hadaka Apron".
Bill: HUH
Bill: Interesting.
