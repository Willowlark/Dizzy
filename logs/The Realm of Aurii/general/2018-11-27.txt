No kristmas for bad kids(Marisa): "If you opt for machine washing, you should turn the viscose item inside out, and place it in a Mesh Washing Bag to avoid snags and tears.
Select the delicate cycle on the washing machine, and make sure the water temperature is cold and the spin is on low.
Lay the item flat in its natural shape on a drying rack or hang to dry. Do not put it in the dryer, as it may shrink!"

wrap the dress with washing instructions
