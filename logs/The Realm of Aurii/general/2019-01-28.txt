N🆗ri (Marisa): Really?? They’re so freaky. Pineapple plants so spooky. 

Yesterday I tried to work on the skirt but I need big wire cutters, and I tried to apply for graduation but I need to pay $700 and my card keeps getting declined when I pay online so I have to wire transfer the money but that costs me an additional $200 out of pocket and they haven’t gotten my last transfer yet which makes me very nervous, and I went t

N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye Rowan’s was much less

Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~yes i am~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sneky
Bill: You snuck up on me like, 30 times in the last game.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): last game was best game
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz i could snek. no snek in regular game just little kids
N🆗ri (Marisa): shake ur hand at the little kids and be like “ged oudda here!”

N🆗ri (Marisa): misguided kids next door operative
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so you need wire cutter for your skirt? :0 where u can get those?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee. Home Depot has them. We should have a pair here we just don’t know where they are. And they can get pretty expensive so I’m not going to buy one. We know some landscaping and construction company owners maybe I can ask one of them to borrow it for 5 minutes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YEA
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): do they live nearby?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hmmmm 🤔 maybe? Idk
My sister might have a pair in her basement maybe or I could ask my uncle at my cousin’s wedding. “Hey did u bring industrial wire cutters with u”

Dirty Lego (Tom): YEAH
Dirty Lego (Tom): I MADE THE KIDS NEXT DOOR JOKENTOO EYYY
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had a dream where I was in a store and everything was rocket power-themed (like there were regular toothbrushes and then ROCKET POWER TOOTHBRUSHES stuff like that) and there were a ton of foreign tourists from around the world in the Walmart who were desperately buying all the rocket power stuff they could and doing the hand thing the characters did whenever they put something in their cart
Bill: There are other cosplayers in the area, like Zeikani and Dan. Maybeh you could borrow from dem?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Gasp I couldn’t impose like that
Bill: Why not? From what I got of Zeikani she'll be friends with *anyone*, and Dan is a good dude, he even recognized you when you came back.
Bill: Can't hurt to ask.
Bill: That's how you get to sew bathrobes for famous people.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I could never impose like that gasp
N🆗ri (Marisa): My cat is sitting on half the phone so it’s hard to type owo
Bill: ~~You want me to ask on a story~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): **NO DONT DO THAT**
Bill: So... we're putting in a french drain to keep the basement from flooding again...
Bill: The wall my desk is on is vibrating. Sounds like an SMG.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ask it in French to stop
Dirty Lego (Tom): Omelet du fromage
N🆗ri (Marisa): i will get the katsu payment to you by katsu
it'll take a bit of time but i'll have it by the con fo' sure
Bill: is fine. I know you'll be good for it, I don't really stress it with friends.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the youtube picture in picture feature is so great
Bill: Huh.
N🆗ri (Marisa): huh
Bill: So cause of the issues I've had with the computer, our friend who owns a nissan dealership said I should apply for 'lemon law' which is basically 'this car defective take it back'.

It actually worked.
N🆗ri (Marisa): DRIVING A LEMON?
MAKE THE CALL
TO ONE EIGHT HUNDRED
LEMON LAW
Bill: Which turns into either a replacement Altima (year or two newer), or a refund of everything I've paid into the car and the loan on it paid off, which I can then use to buy something else.
N🆗ri (Marisa): did you make the call to one eight hundred lemon law
Bill: So now I have to car shop cause that refund would make a sizable down payment on a different model.
N🆗ri (Marisa): *did you make the call to one eight hundred lemon law*
N🆗ri (Marisa): was the car like that when you bought it
N🆗ri (Marisa): does anybody use false bottom lashes for cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): considering it for tsuyu but seems like a pain to keep them on
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I’ve never tried on the bottom
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Seems tedious 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): i might try them for katsu but i also might rip them off 5 minutes after putting them on
Dirty Lego (Tom): Or can draw it with eyeliner 🙏
N🆗ri (Marisa): would that look silly and obviously drawn on tho
Dirty Lego (Tom): I think I've seen a lot of tsuyus do it
Dirty Lego (Tom): Cuz it kinda looks like that in the show
Bill: ...
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye I think that’s what a lot do
N🆗ri (Marisa): brb gonna go draw on my face
N🆗ri (Marisa): i just had all sorts of ideas for valentines day and then i remembered that's katsu. darn.
Bill: Oh?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's katsu
Bill: What were the ideas.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o for valentine's day costumes/shoots, and also making chocolate
making chocolate for anime characters
they do that in japan there's a huge contest for the prince of tennis every year and they need to rent warehouses to store the fan-made chocolate
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): the resin molds i have can double as chocolate molds if i clean them really thoroughly though so if katsu wasn't valentine's day i was thinking of making fancy anime chocolate
Bill: You could do them!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i gotta finish everything for katsu <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
