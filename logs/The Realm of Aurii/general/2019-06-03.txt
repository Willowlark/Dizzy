Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~they really werent that bad but it became cool not to like them~~
N👌kri (Marisa): yee <:rip:369476083248267274> people made fun of everyone who enjoyed them? why they gotta hate on girls reading books
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea like "oh sorry for reading"
N👌kri (Marisa): for some reason it reminds me of the tumblr post where a girl was like "is it weird i find pro-wrestlers more attractive than anime boys?" and everyone had to collectively step back and think about our society where oogling anime boys is more accepted than oogling irl wrestlers
N👌kri (Marisa): or like, finding things attractive i guess rather than oogling
Aldus Larian (Jess): i used to feel weird for liking skinny bois when it seemed like everyone around me was like "MUSCLES"

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What
Kaio Vermino (Lee): wut
N👌kri (Marisa): wot
Bill: Skinny and fit...? All that.
Bill: Not that it’s a wrong statement.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t understand what you’re saying because your sentences be choppy my guy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Unless you’re saying “Jess, Leanna, and Georgia like fit skinny guys, so every girl must be that way” <:hmm:543194383885926403>
N👌kri (Marisa): i like this pincushion that looks like a tomato
Kaio Vermino (Lee): WAIT in that case go back to the start of the conversation where this came about because we were saying other people like the opposite <:pew:543202259085950996>
Kaio Vermino (Lee): OH marisa i have a pin cushion thats a sunflower
Kaio Vermino (Lee): it cute
Bill: I’m flattered you think I have rock hard muscles 😂
Bill: Just sad energy pay me no mind.
N👌kri (Marisa): sunflower pincushion!! :0
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Well I guess that conversation topic died
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which I was actually thoroughly enjoying because rarely do I get to do girl talk
Bill: Sorry.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I cannot articulate why this is annoying me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s like we were having a good conversation about peanut butter and someone leaned in and went “if I eat a peanut I’ll die”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And you shouldn’t even care what Jess, Leanna, and I think anyways
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We aren’t a good sample of the female population
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just why
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea my friends were always like "you have weird taste"
Aldus Larian (Jess): and i was like "coo"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like
Bill: I mean, you're all beautiful women, and kind, smart, fun to be around. I'd of course want to be attractive to anyone like you three.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yes but like it’s not like we’re even on the table anyways
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Jess is married, I’m taken, Leanna is doing their own thang for a while
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like BASICALLY that just went “we all like skinny fit bois” and you went “well ha that isn’t me”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like ok
Bill: like, not you specifically. 😑
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ok but it was still inappropriate!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): If you Andrew and Erik went “hey I like tall girls with small boobs” I wouldn’t pop in like OH BUT THATS NOT ME LOL
Aldus Larian (Jess): It was mostly just buzz kill, but i understand why you'd get a little down about the convo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I get that it would bring you down
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was just an inappropriate comment that made the conversation about you when it wasn’t in the first place
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m really whipped about this now goddamn
Bill: Sorry Georgia. You can feel free to go back to the conversation.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just keep it in mind
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe I’m being selfish because I never get to have girl talk because I struggle to understand women who knows
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But like gosh
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~girl talk to me anytime yo~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t remember the last time I talked about boys til now <:hmm:543194383885926403>
