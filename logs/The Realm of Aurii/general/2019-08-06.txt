El🆓de Faun (Tom): Less nice but still nice

Bill: `gartner_service_forecast_fx\["(.*)"\] = \("(.*)".*`

I have such a hard on for Regex. ❤
Bill: rather than manually edit a dozen lines like `gartner_service_forecast_fx["CURRENCY"] = ("VARCHAR(100)", types.VARCHAR(100))` 

I use that line to convert them all to `* **CURRENCY** `VARCHAR(100)` : `.
Bill: Regex is beautiful, advanced pattern matching on strings of text  which allow for manipulation at scale with single line operations.
Bill: If you speak Regex.

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I KNEW I WAS RIGHT ABOUT QDOBA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _best_
Bill: It’s great that it takes about 30 minutes to add a new data cleaner input to my codebase. It’s better that I still have the team thinking it takes a day or two.

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “It’s 4:30 do you just want to go to chili’s?”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): “No no I really want Walmart”
Nokri (Marisa): everyone here is afraid of walmart anymore
Nokri (Marisa): brave souls

El🆓de Faun (Tom): Or that guy from the DC universe
Tikur (Kurtis): Top quality 👌👌👌
Bill: That comments just Mom telling people about my life all the time, which is fine but as a kind of private person it gets a facepalm. 

I see the actual unit tomorrow before I’m signing anything, but my intent is to take it yes. As for anxious, it’s just a huge pain in the ass to move. I have a lot of stuff. I’ll be excited the day after I move all my stuff. Before that? Pain in the ass.
Bill: I mean, I’ll be low key concerned about funding (even though my budget is fine for it) but that’s just because I’m paranoid and such. It’s pretty normal for me with any big spend.
