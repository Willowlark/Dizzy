Afina (Georgia🍀): Must. Resist. Nap. Before Sony.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _but so tired_
Bill: What are you looking at from Sony?
Dave: give in to the nap
Bill: I wonder if all we really need for a wooded photoshoot is the woods out back...
Bill: oh LAST of us is Sony.
Bill: Gotta watch that.
Bill: pfft. The sony guy has lobster red lips.
Bill: 
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> are you allergies murdering you today? Pretty sure we have similar ones and my heads throbbing, you get em worse than me too.
Aldus (Jess): Ugh mine are bad today
Aldus (Jess): I forgot the Zyrtec too
Bill: I took my Allegra and it didn’t help.
Bill: Dunno if the traffic or allergies will kill me first.
Nokri (Marisa): Place your bets
Death by traffic? 🚙 
Death by allergy? 🌻 
Winner takes all
Bill: Imma take back that offer of a spot with us in the future at cons.
Nokri (Marisa): I camp outside your window. You’re on the 18th floor.
Nokri (Marisa): Ryu is messaging me again
Nokri (Marisa): He’s coming to japan we should have a Japanese class meet up grab Halley and Andru
Bill: Allen?
Nokri (Marisa): Ye
Nokri (Marisa): That’s his name. Yeah. Allen. I remembered that.
Aldus (Jess): i gained 3 pounds over con weekend 👀
Nokri (Marisa): ???? How??
Are you sure it’s not the moon
Aldus (Jess): nah my weight is like a delicate flower or smth 👌
Nokri (Marisa): I’m blaming the moon even though it’s the opposite
Nokri (Marisa): the comic i'm reading has so many good reaction images but also it's so lewd i have to skip like 90% of pages
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmao nice 👌 👌
Bill: yay Ashley accepted my friend request!
Bill: whoops I had a noon call. and a webinar at 1. ~~I guess I ain't eating real food~~
Aldus (Jess): how it only 12:30?
Bill: once again, these meetings devolve into a discussion of legality. Given we work for clients, if we write the standard logging tools for the company and use it with the client, the client then kinda gets to claim the copyright to it.
Bill: Code's implemented, now we just need the links.
Bill: Rip no real food for me.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEET I just got a current NASA employee to write a letter of recommendation for my internship application
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Fantastic!
Bill: Is this the one you were going to get ~~coffee~~ hot chocolate with?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): I emailed her a bunch of questions and even went out on a limb to ask what advice and help she could provide specific to my internship application
Afina (Georgia🍀): And she said she would be happy to help me through the process and says that she would write a litter of recommendation for me!
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think I need two letters so I'll ask a physics professor in fall for the other one
Bill: 👌 👌 👌
Bill: Though you don't want to let her forget about the letter either, I remember getting letters from my professor being a reminder game.
Bill: Nothing to worry about now though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah submissions for summer don't open until spring so I'll definitely email her when t gets closer
Afina (Georgia🍀): Right now is getting all my ducks in a row
Afina (Georgia🍀): So next on my "NASA to do list" is crush math this summer to get my GPA to a solid 3.5, and finish my star data processing thing so I can set up a website
Afina (Georgia🍀): Rockets here I come 🚀
Bill: I don't want you to go to Maryland for a while summer, but it's certainly exciting.
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's only 10 weeks so it's more like half the summer 😜
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~plus I'll be near gazebo land~~
Bill: well, lets not count the chickens before they hatch either.
Bill: ~~we don't go to gazebo land in the summer~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye for now I'll focus on studying for my Diff Eq midterm on Monday lol
Bill: rip, enjoy death.
Bill: Man my stomach hurts. I might leave now, I got stomach meds in the car.
Bill: My hours are shenanigans.
Afina (Georgia🍀): BODIED
Bill: ,...
Bill: I’m not agreeing with you.
