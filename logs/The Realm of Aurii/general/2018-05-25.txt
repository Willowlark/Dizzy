Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Birdies!!!
Afina (Georgia🍀): There are literal squadrons of guys walking in for Solo right now g dang
Afina (Georgia🍀): The guy who plays Newt in the new Harry Potter also plays Stephen hawking in the movie about his life
Afina (Georgia🍀): So every time I see adverts for the HP movie it just looks like Stephen hawking to me
Nokri (Marisa): finally the wizarding world embraces science
Afina (Georgia🍀): Pro-tip: Solo wasn't anything impressive just sayin
Nokri (Marisa): Is the saying “tip top” like “tip top condition” old fashioned?
I taught it to a student a few weeks ago and today I was looking at that students lesson records and someone at another school location *told her it was old-fashioned*
This calls for fisticuffs
I am offended
Is this truly old fashioned
Nokri (Marisa): *another instructor sided with me I am in the clear. Fisticuffs engaged I am going to the other studio for a rousing duel*
Nokri (Marisa): This knave doth not know what’s gonna hit ‘em
Nokri (Marisa): Two no show clients in a row. Getting paid to sit and do nothing for an hour and a half. Hashtag blessed.
I can plot my revenge on the other instructor.
Bill: tip top is kinda outdated ye.
Nokri (Marisa): FIGHT ME
Nokri (Marisa): Next you’re gonna try and tell me people don’t say “gnarly” anymore smh
Nokri (Marisa): You know what. I’m really surprised I’ve never seen a maid spongebob cosplay. 
Has anyone ever seen a maid sponge bob cosplay.
Nokri (Marisa): Biru I have a great idea for your next con attire
Bill: I'm terrified.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Tip top sounds like British outdated yeah <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Like Mary Poppins is gonna say that to me or some shit
Nokri (Marisa): I met Mary poppins on Monday she said meet her in the pit to fight
Nokri (Marisa): She’s gonna say it while fighting
Nokri (Marisa): Did you know you can crush someone’s eyeball with the same amount of strength needed to crush an empty soda can
Fun fact from high school gym class
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That's ..... Not surprising
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 👌
Nokri (Marisa): one student today was a tiny jr high schooler
loves disney and boy bands and all the regular cutesy stuff
"what's your favorite comic?" "the promised neverland"
of course it is.
Nokri (Marisa): the more innocent the child on the outside the more corrupt they are inside
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Gives me a made in abyss vibe
Nokri (Marisa): ye they're really similar!!
Nokri (Marisa): made in abyss is a little more twisted and gory. neverland is overall eerie and unsettling but abyss throws in those little nonchalant moments of terror
Nokri (Marisa): neverland admits "lol this is messed up" whereas abyss is like "yeahh, mutilation happens sometimes. oh well."
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: 👌 👌
Bill: According to facebook, today is Lizi's birthday! 😆
Aldus (Jess): whoooo!

Bill: well, it's thunderstorming tomorrow so no.
Nokri (Marisa): Don’t let this be like dashcon
Nokri (Marisa): Once when there was construction on our street they took out all of the sidewalks so there was a waterless moat in front of all the houses and to get to a door you had to cross a wooden plank
Will birucon have that
Nokri (Marisa): If you fell it was like a 5 foot drop into the pit that would be awesome to recreate
Bill: We have a 15 foot hole in the road.
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH!! That works now all you need is a plank
Afina (Georgia🍀): I remember at the wedding Alice said she paid 3000 for flowers, I feel like for me it'd be cheaper just to go to jo Anns with all my coupons and clean out their fake flower aisle
Aldus (Jess): i paid $75 for a box of loose flowers from costco. and spent about $50 on the bridal party flowers from ecoflower (they are paper and wood so you can keep them forever)
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeee they were neet
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah like 3k for regular flowers that'll die?? No no no
Afina (Georgia🍀): Alice and her hubby paid a lot tho the invites were 200 each

Afina (Georgia🍀): They got some kinda fancy NY designer to do them
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then the invite arrived in a package of moss
Aldus (Jess): LMFAO their fucking invites  alone cost 3 times my entire wedding
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I would've thought alcohol was the biggest expense
Afina (Georgia🍀): But nooope 40k for invites
Aldus (Jess): hell fucking no. nope nope nope
Aldus (Jess): even if i had money for that, i couldnt justify that

Bill: Ronnie chicken had a huge wedding. We didn't go cause it was in Georgia (lol), but we found out later they spent most of the reception greeting people.
Bill: like, for 4+ hours.
Bill: Simple is all you need, when you have people you want to be with.
Aldus (Jess): fuuuucckkk that
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> you don't have a bluetooth in your car right? This is a charger, Bluetooth FM transmitter, and can help you find your car for 20 bucks.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah I don't have Bluetooth cause my cars a 2012
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Bill: This thing'll broadcast your music as a radio station, no wires required.
Aldus (Jess): mines a '13, my brother had an '11 with bluetooth
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH I've had those before, it's slightly tedious to use them tho
Afina (Georgia🍀): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Afina (Georgia🍀): I can't complain, I don't even pay for the car and I always wanted a truck lol
Aldus (Jess): oh yea i im not saying that

Afina (Georgia🍀): physics is just so much more _me_
Afina (Georgia🍀): i think im just gonna say physics, who the heckie is gonna call my lie
Bill: No one.
Bill: And Physics is da bomb.
Afina (Georgia🍀): like i hate to say it but every major has their stereotype
Afina (Georgia🍀): and i think i just fit physics more than poli sci, irregardless of how i love BOTH subjects
Bill: You a stem girl.
Bill: Which technically aren’t supposed to exist.
Bill: Be the unicorn you are.
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOOO UNICORN
