Bill: A raw line break is \r\n.
Aldus (Jess): Ooooo
Aldus (Jess): That does work either tho right?
Bill: HTML ignore white space characters, which newlines count for, which is why the <br> came into being.
Bill: nope, doesn't work either.
Bill: Very few things these days parse raw HTML. it's a security flaw.
Bill: Markdown has picked up speed, but instagram uses raw text.
Aldus (Jess): Mmmm spicy
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: https://schedugr.am/blog/how-to-add-line-breaks-on-instagram/
Bill: yeah, I use the period/dash breaks, but I didn't know that it fails if there's a trailing space in the line before hand.
