Tikur (Kurtis): Alexa play despacito
Nokri (Marisa): We exist as a resonance cascade.
Divinity is a constant. You and I are spiritual brothers and sisters of the stratosphere.
We vibrate, we heal, we are reborn.
We can no longer afford to live with pain. You may be ruled by turbulence without realizing it. Do not let it eradicate the nature of your myth. Dogma is the antithesis of power.


We are in the midst of a quantum refining of ecstasy that will clear a path toward the quantum matrix itself. Our conversations with other adventurers have led to a condensing of supra-unrestricted consciousness. Throughout history, humans have been interacting with the biosphere via expanding wave functions.

Dogma is born in the gap where presence has been excluded. Where there is turbulence, potential cannot thrive. Without karma, one cannot believe.

It is in ennobling that we are aligned.
You must take a stand against greed. Yes, it is possible to sabotage the things that can erase us, but not without manna on our side. Only a lifeform of the biosphere may bring about this transmission of intention.
Elfriede (Tom): The only place I've heard resonance Cascade is half-life

Elfriede (Tom): Yo I woke up in the middle of the night to a nightmare it was some trippy stuff. I occasionally have crazy world ending nightmares about space.  In this one the moon was hit by a meteor and slowly decended to earth which was also hit by a meteorknocking the entire planet off track. I was outside and watched it in the sky. That shit was terrifying ðŸ‘Œ.
Elfriede (Tom): The whole planet spun and began destroying itself around me
Nokri (Marisa): Oooo how did t look
Nokri (Marisa): future vision
Elfriede (Tom): It is terifying
Elfriede (Tom): I've had so many dreams of like floating in space in a rouge space ship in the abyss of space

Elfriede (Tom): Or dreams of looking up into the sky and seeing huge planets loom over earth
