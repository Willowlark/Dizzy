Elfriede (Tom): Wpahhhh
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> General?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Woah voice party
Elfriede (Tom): :3
Total Nok-out (Marisa): two bros
chillin' in the voice chat
five feet apart
To Afina-ty and Beyond (Georgia): cause dey a little gey
Bill: Yeah you got it, no evidence to the contrary of THAT could exist.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): ‚ÄúCharlie the unicorn created YouTube‚Äù oh underclassmen you are so young
Bill: Listening to a Matt Mercer interview on game design podcast... I need to do more with gaming... guys a genius sure, but he bleeds experience.
Bill: Heeeeh. Just heard the first podcast guests to, when asked where to find them on social media, suggest discord.
Bill: Discord‚Äôs really gotten good at forming communities.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeeet üëå
Bill: Third guest is writing a magical girl tabletop. She called cardcaptor sakura sacorera. What a weeb.
Bill: Ooooooooffffffff she‚Äôs succcccch a weeeeeeebbbbbb
Bill: She thinks blood types in character bios is a unique thing to magical girls and needs to be part of the character sheet.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): I love cardcaptor sacorera
Total Nok-out (Marisa): Feat sacorera and kebab-chan
Total Nok-out (Marisa): It‚Äôs crowded and someone just parked a stroller in front of me I dunno if I can get off this train ;u;
Elfriede (Tom): Ughh
Total Nok-out (Marisa): They moved phew we safe
Bill: RIP. I was listening to older episodes of that podcast, City of Mist is currently out of print since the kickstarter ended.
Bill: I can get the pdf, but I'd want a hardcover too.
Bill: I feel terrible and I don't know if I'm getting sick, it's the drive, sleeping shitty, underlying feelings of DEATH, or what.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): maybe it's the moon
Total Nok-out (Marisa): it's full tonight
Elfriede (Tom): We've kinda felt the same the passed few days idk what's up
Bill: I was laughing at something matt mercer said and I stopped and I was like 'why do I feel like I'm going to cry' and it was confusing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im still feeling kinda sick, cold weathers got me down, little stressy, little depressy
Bill: Alright while I really want Wednesday night Recess to be a thing, I‚Äôm probably just going to want to go home. ~~I already do~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): feel like thay prob have a bigger crowd on saturdays
Bill: Fighting game night, and we're busy on weekends.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not all weekends
Bill: Most weekends.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~not to mention there was no one to fight with~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Im guessing tonight could maaaaybe be a little more popular since its a new game tho?
Bill: The more people go, the bigger it‚Äôll get. Imagine one guy goes, sees it‚Äôs just the organizer dude, doesn‚Äôt come back. Or, he sees Tom playing with the guy, you and me playing on the other couch, and stays to come see the group again.
Bill: Plus new place blues, etc.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): place cardboard cutouts around to give the illusion of a crowd
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yes good
Total Nok-out (Marisa): maybe some voice clips from popular sitcoms playing on a loop to simulate idle chatter
Bill: Genius.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont mind going semi regularly, just dunno about every week
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): if it was closer
Bill: Nothing to be done about the distance. Hell, it‚Äôs pretty close compared to anything similar. üòÖ
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sure, im not saying it isnt. I'm just saying a bar trip once a week can get pricey.and its still a 25 min ride regardless
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): in the end its up to tom for me, hes the one that has to make the drive.
Bill: mm. I'd like to be a regular there, the owners are nice and it's really a perfect setup for us. ~~plus I've always wanted to be a regular at a bar`~
Bill: ~~meanwhile, me remembering the apartment complex I saw down the street~~ To Zillow!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i know you do, youve said it for a long time, like i said i dont mind going semi regularly, i like the place but personally ive never had the specific want to be a regualr anywhere
Bill: huh. That apartment complex doesn't show up on Zillow.
Bill: ~~There's a house for sale across 46 that's only 988k, 5 bedrooms, 3 baths, why not~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): *only???????????*
Total Nok-out (Marisa): what a steal
Bill: *Party house*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~thats still 200,000 a "room"
Bill: https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Parsippany.dash.Troy-Hills-NJ-07054/82172739_zpid/60564_rid/40.864361,-74.349064,40.85266,-74.364514_rect/15_zm/0_mmm/1_fr/
Bill: It was actually *899*, what a *steal*.
Bill: too bad there's no floor plan.
Total Nok-out (Marisa): that's cuz there is no floor
Bill: shit they spend all the money on the bathrooms and forgot the floor? ripperoni.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~too bad its almost a million dollars and doesnt even have fully updated bathrooms~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): those bathrroms aint even nice theyre like 1990 standard
Bill: I'll take your word for it lol.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): been watchin HGTV since i was 12 years old <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: http://www.rutgersvillage.com/388/406.html These are the apartments in walking distance.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not bad
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): no pics tho? üòÆ
Bill: Not really. Site under construction.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ah
Bill: I'm not actually jumping to move out cause of Recess, but at least 1.5k a month for two bedroom is... not impossible?
Bill: Still pretty insane but.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): y u need 2 bedroom?
Total Nok-out (Marisa): one for action figures
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 1 br is 1260.00, pretty spacious
Bill: Personally I'd like an office when I move out. In reality, I'd need a roommate to move out practically. 1.5k a month?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): looks like at least
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): includes heat/hot water at least
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): seems like pretty standard rent for the area
Bill: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Bill: I've never seriously looked. I'm not bothering till I pay off the rest of my college loans.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): allthough im not up to date on current going rates for apartments since im not in the market
Bill: ~~maybe I should learn to cook before I move out too~~
Bill: ~~else I'll survive on quickchek and microwavable stuff~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): big oof
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cooking isnt really hard if you have a recipe and directions, or just some basic knowledge
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): internet is helpful
Bill: I made stuff in college, I'm just out of practice and don't bother buying stuff for the house.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): u dont make breakfast or lunch?
Bill: Nope. I either get dunkin when going to Armonk, or have a breakfast bar when at home/going to NYC.
Bill: Lunch I don't want to deal with keeping cold the 2 hour commute plus 3~4 hours till I eat it, so I don't bring anything. I eat out in NYC, the Armonk Cafeteria, or go to quick chek when I'm home (that one is just cause I like quickchek and Dad does it too so bleeeh).
Elfriede (Tom): Just ask Kurtis to go to the bar , he literally works in parcipanny <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Tru, but his Mom's been sick so she need him at home. He being an good boi.
Bill: ~~Did you both miss the part where I said I feel shitty and don't want to go tonight anyway~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im nto talking tonight
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im talking in general
Bill: ,... Apparently I've had aurii published to the site for awhile now.

Elfriede (Tom): So everyone today I realized the wind can blow your voice
Elfriede (Tom): Isn't that crazy
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): spoopy
Elfriede (Tom): Like if you are standing down wind of someone and try to.talk they have more trouble hearing you
Elfriede (Tom): Because the wind is blowing the vibrating air away from your target
Elfriede (Tom): And it's really funny to think the wind can blow your voice
Bill: sounds like a quirk.
Bill: What a day.
Bill: Imma die driving home.
Bill: NEVERMIND There was a new episode of Jim Jefferies podcast and I just listened to 23 minutes discussing where everyone in the room is on the hot scale, 1-10. It wasn‚Äôt pretty. Savage and hilarious. So much quotable stuff.
Bill: Talking about one guy and they were like oh yeah, you‚Äôre at 10 I. Personality but no body ever wants to see a photo of you, you‚Äôre just ugly man.
Bill: Gold. Terrible. But gold.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oof
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea dis humor isnt really my thing, especially live  i couldnt take that if i got picked on
Bill: He‚Äôs especially an ass on this show. But he did crosscheck with the one guy if he was getting upset as a bit and he said yeah. He‚Äôs a staffer for the show so they know each other.
Bill: ~~meanwhile he called the Irish group watching the recording ‚Äúrangers‚Äù which is an Australian slur for red head~~
Bill: Not saying as the only one below a 5 in this friend group I enjoyed it but like <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: My favorite part is how it feels like a bunch of guys fucking around on mic for 40 minutes. It‚Äôs so casual.
Bill: If I made a podcast... I‚Äôd call it Salt Mining, and the point would be we talk about something that I‚Äôll be salty and sarcastic about.
