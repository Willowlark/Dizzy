Nokri (Marisa): You get to keep that bag in the preview image, but a lot of people get angry and might not want to talk to you.
Nokri (Marisa): if someone had long enough body hair and they cut it so it was layered, could they float like an otter
Nokri (Marisa): like someone with hypertrichosis
Nokri (Marisa): and then maybe tease the hair out. lots of grooming.
then go jump in a lake and see if they float
Nokri (Marisa): is there negative weight
google gives me Dijkstra's algorithm but that's about graphs and not mass
Nokri (Marisa): this server dead, yeet
Aldus Larian (Jess): im sitting here thinking about negative weight
Nokri (Marisa): if it existed in a stable form i think the fashion industry would have grabbed hold of it
but maybe not because it just affects weight and not body shape
Nokri (Marisa): amazon would have it
Nokri (Marisa): cheaper shipping
Nokri (Marisa): thinkin' 'bout beezlebub's hat
