Andrew: ごめんなさい
Andrew: あなたは？本や映画を経験していますか？
Nokri (Marisa): 今日あの新しいポケモン映画を見に参りました。ネタバレを出さないが、見た前にすごい期待を持ってた。ま、悪くなかったと思うがやはり子供の映画です。ある人々の演技にちょっと文句があります。けれども楽しったですわ。

Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh shit I forgot a about that
Andrew: 大丈夫です。その映画見たいですが、友達と行きたいから、今待っています。しかし先週新しいコードギアス映画を二回見に行きました。二回の時一人に行って、一回の時映画を好きになりましたから。（もう二回の前にまた全部シリーズを見ました.)
Andrew: the grammar is a bit off i think in the second half because i didnt know how to phrase it
Andrew: i hope you can understand
Nokri (Marisa): 「2回目の時、一人で行って」はずですね。
理由は初めてみた際、すごく好きだった。それで帰ったり、テレビアニメを全部改めて見たり、また映画を見に行ったりした。
そのつもりですか？
Nokri (Marisa): 二回の時一人に行って kinda sounds like “the time I went to that person twice”
Nokri (Marisa): Is understandable!! As a sentence!! People would get what you mean but ye grammar is a bit wonky <:rip:369476083248267274>

Andrew: My old german teacher in high school always told me that youve succeeded in translating if the other person gets what you meant, even if its wrong.
Andrew: At the very least in our casual chats lol
Andrew: I want to find some translating work on the side to practice, get me using every day
Nokri (Marisa): If you want every day practice, lots o scanlation teams always need translators, but have a strict schedule to adhere to
Nokri (Marisa): To find anything, you must truly give up all hope of finding it. Such is how I finally found my 3ds charger wrapped around a drill in the bottom of a toolbox I’ve never ever touched while searching for a hammer.

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I decided to finally make part of my job easier. I've been making a lot of layouts in Solidworks lately and I always download the connector part files and save them to the product folders they're used in, but a lot of these recent assemblies use the same parts so I have a bunch of duplicates scattered in various folders. Finally decided to just start saving them to Solidwork's design library folder so they're always readily available once I open solidworks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): don't know why I never did this sooner
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's going to be my new thing when I have nothing to do or am just bored is just start searching through all the products I've made layouts for and adding the part files to the library
