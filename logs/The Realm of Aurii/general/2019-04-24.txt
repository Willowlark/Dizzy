Bill: I’m feeling a just a wee bit overstimulated by my usually 100% connectivity, and my usual fix for that is a few days offline. I’m doing that and ghosting insta/discord. Jess is in charge (implying I have any control over you lot to give to her), I’m not avoiding anyone just @ me or DM if you need me. Be back Friday sometime. Probably to bitch about booking Katsu.
