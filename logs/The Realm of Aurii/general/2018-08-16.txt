Bill: Hourly at best.
Nokri (Marisa): that's rough buddy
Nokri (Marisa): you ever have a nickname that's been a huge part of your life and realize people don't call you it anymore 🤔

Elfriede (Tom): Hmm
Elfriede (Tom): How long are you guys down in NC for?
Eliran (Halim): we come back the 19th
Elfriede (Tom): Ah kk, so like a full week was it?
Eliran (Halim): ye
Bill: The correct answer is too soon.
Aldus (Jess): im being tested today, theres 2 trays of cookies and 2 cakes in the kitchen
Bill: I'm starting to miss my big noise cancelling headphones.
Eliran (Halim): control yourself
Eliran (Halim): and eat only 1 cake
Aldus (Jess): lmfao
Afina (Georgia🍀): And 1 tray!
Aldus (Jess): lmfao guys 😂
Bill: I stopped wearing them when they flattened down my hair, but everything's being noisy today.
Aldus (Jess): THERES CHEESECAKE TOO 😭
Bill: So I skipped out on group lunch to keep working.
Bill: Now there's going to be a dessert break later, I suppose they wanted to do a birthday thing. Le sigh.
Aldus (Jess): for you?
Bill: Mhmm. Last time... actually we were all in the city Monday, what the heck.
Bill: They missed their chance.
Bill: (I’m actually feeling productive for once and don’t want to do mandatory socialization)
Aldus (Jess): The soda machine gave me a free drink 😊
Bill: ewwwww Gord wants me to make a *powerpoint*.
Aldus (Jess): lmao
Aldus (Jess): have fun!
Bill: https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B0756CYWWD ~~I say I want over ear headphones and they're on sale...~~
Bill: Aaaand now I’m staying late for the stupid dessert break.
Bill: Should have just left.
Aldus (Jess): free food tho
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: I miss dinner when I stay in the city. And I don’t feel like being out here that late.
Bill: Alright, maybe I really do need to see if I can find something in jersey. The city appeal really has worn out.
Bill: Le sigh.
Dizzy: Here's what I have.
```thatsfire count is at 25.
bill-drunk-discording count is at 1.

Bill: !counter list
Bill: !counter bill-drunk-discording add 1
Dizzy: The bill-drunk-discording count is now 2!
Aldus (Jess): You went from "I don't wanna do desert outing" to drunk in 1.5 hours?
Bill: It’s weird. I used down 4 scotch and sodas before I’d get drunk (ish, I’m not sloshed) but these days one can get my tipsy at a bar.
Bill: Yeah, we had a shitty 30 minute trip to an ice cream truck, had some random crappy conversation, and everyone went home. My train is now 7:30, so I killed time at the bar.
Eliran (Halim): question
Eliran (Halim): can we add a reason otakon sucks counter
Eliran (Halim): cause tbh it definitely earned it more than rtx
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aldus (Jess): ~~i don't think we should have a any con sucks counter~~
Bill: I’ll remove the rtx sucks counter later, it’s not relevant anymore. It was a passive aggressive way of sharing how worried about rtx going poorly cause of drama I was.
Bill: Eh. Maybe the effect is amplified being at the bar itself. It’s less prominent now that I’ve left.
