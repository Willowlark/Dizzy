Bill: “Remember no man is a failure who has friends”

In all the years of it’s a wonderful life being in in my house, I never seen it from front to back before.
Bill: I needed that.
Bill: 
Bill: I wish Bach didn't mention this was a youtuber, she cute but youtuber yuck.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Still good art 👌
Bill: Oh ye, that's why I sad.
Bill: Waifu cute.
Bill: Kinda MC like.
Bill: Very MC like, actually.
Bill: Cept for the fact she got eyes.
Bill: It weird being not at work man.
Bill: At least for these days at home till we vacation.
Bill: Today on weird dreams... I had one where I had the ability to teleport, so long as I could see the place or remember it well. But the strange part was I had vivid memories of discovering and using them at Rowan, and my half asleep mind was  taking that seriously so I was very confused as to why I don't still use said power.

Then I had one where the world got zombie robot animals, basically monstrous animals like in Horizon but zombies instead of robots. Some dude came by and traded me what was a german shepard leashed to a zombie like, buck. The sherpard wouldn't be bitten by the zombie, so the guy trained the shepard to to drag the zombie buck towards whatever I wanted the buck to attack. 

There were like two more too.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Neeto, I woke up like a million times last night for some reason
Bill: same, only reason I remember things.
