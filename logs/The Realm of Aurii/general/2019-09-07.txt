Nokri (Marisa): SOMEONE ON NEOPETS BOUGHT THE THING I WAS GONNA BUY
who else is still on this ancient website and bought the thing before me. who did it. you had like 3 seconds before it restocked and i clicked the link *who are you*
Nokri (Marisa): Ooo. All the sirens outside are because a guy went out to the supermarket to get food, and never came home. His wife went looking for him and he was dead in the parking lot and no one knows how he died
Nokri (Marisa): They‚Äôre questioning everyone leaving the supermarket, all the cars have to go through police first
Aldus Larian (Jess): WAT omggg
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah how terrifying is that. Your family member goes to grab dinner and is mysteriously found dead in the parking lot
Nokri (Marisa): Xbox is having problems and I can‚Äôt log into Xbox live. Blah. How am I supposed to entertain BoJo during dinner
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no!
Nokri (Marisa): Brb suing Microsoft
Nokri (Marisa): do you guys remember
Kaio Vermino (Lee): YES
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I LOVED THOSE
Nokri (Marisa): bring üëè them üëè back
Nokri (Marisa): i think i had one with Who Let The Dogs Out and I Want It That Way
the only two american songs i know
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I loved being able to hear 30 seconds of the latest hit songs!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): It's like tiktok but real life
Kaio Vermino (Lee): ~~someone shoot me~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's like iTunes previes you have to pay for!
Kaio Vermino (Lee): You WHAT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I meant comparing it to iTunes previews but instead, you have to pay
Kaio Vermino (Lee): OH omg
Kaio Vermino (Lee): I thought you meant you have to pay for previews
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And was like bro.... it IS apple
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): remember when every song on iTunes used to cost $0.99 and then they made a big deal about changing their prices to 3 different prices: $0.69, $0.99, and $1.29 and they made it seem like you were going to be able to get cheaper music but instead it was only a small amount of songs available for $0.69 and most everything else popular went to $1.29?
Nokri (Marisa): is that how much they cost now? i just use youtube for all music
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that was back in like 2007 when I was a good boy and paid for my music and then I discovered Audacity and went through the convoluted process of recording from YouTube through my computer's internal audio
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then I discovered youtube to mp3 websites
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there was a period I also used a tumblr extension to download audio posts but then they cracked down on copyright :/
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooooooooooooooooooo that's right, tumblr had good mp3s
Nokri (Marisa): [sends client their otakon images]
[they like the message and don't say anything else]
whoooo boi i need to make a good playlist now to forget about that
Nokri (Marisa): SHE WAS JUST SCREENSHOTTING HER FAVORITES AND SENT ME LIKE 20 SCREENSHOTS im so honored
Bill: Welp I‚Äôm running late but my hair is perfectly Claude like! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> (not that I‚Äôm cosplaying the faire, it‚Äôs just my new do)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So today's word of the day is polyglot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Used in a sentence: *"Marisa is a talented polyglot because she speaks both English and Japanese"*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh hey I learned that work like two weeks ago
Bill: At first I was like ‚Äúwow there‚Äôs a lot of marvel for a renn faire‚Äù and then I remembered it‚Äôs heroes and villains weekend.
Nokri (Marisa): I can speak Japanese as well as I can read Hebrew
Horribly <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): The most helpful thing about studying French is that I can watch new episodes of miraculous ladybug in French without subtitles and that‚Äôs it so far
Nokri (Marisa): Oh and yell at documentaries when the subtitles say a French lady is [speaking french] but an African man is [speaking foreign language] *but they‚Äôre both speaking French and the subtitler is probably racist*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Reminds me of this gem: https://youtu.be/6xk1HqQ727U
Nokri (Marisa): ITS TRUE IT SUCKS WHEN THEY DO THAT
Nokri (Marisa): Tangier English was originally hard for me to follow but it sounds fine now
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AIZgw09CG9E
Nokri (Marisa): I guess it was difficult because it‚Äôs kind of the opposite of our northeastern accent
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had plans to practice music and do more clothes purging today but I accidentally laid back down on my bed and this is probably where I'm going to stay the rest of the day
