Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I want to get my entire family Crocs for Christmas since they're on mega sale but I'm not sure if I can start shipping to my apartment yet (assuming they arrive after I move in) but I'm not sure how I would be able to explain a large box with 4 pairs of Crocs to my parents without spoiling it
Kaio Vermino (Lee): when do you move in
Bill: You can ship to a friend
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Saturday technically
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hmm... I guess I could probably ship to work... 🤔
Bill: Or to me, I’ll see you before Christmas and don’t mind.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wait never mind. there's literally only one color of the style I was going to get on sale
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): RIP
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): could have sworn it was all of them earlier

El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's not as big as the drive home tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-the-moon-and-the-s/
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ITS AN ILLUSION ITS NOT ACTUALLY BIG
El🆓de Faun (Tom): LIFE IS A LIE
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): https://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8584779/moon-illusion
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Im so mad  about this
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's just because it's near things to give it a relative size and if clouds are in front of it it greatens the effect
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *whack*
Tikur (Kurtis): Me @ y'all
Tikur (Kurtis): Also *wack*
Tikur (Kurtis): 
Bill: I'm not sure how I feel about commuting an hour and a half and then getting to turn around and come work from home. It
Bill: I'm not sure how I feel about commuting an hour and a half and then getting to turn around and come work from home. It's kinda weird, almost like it's the end of the day and all the wasted gas is <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Why do you have to do that?
Bill: I messaged Sheema, the IBMer I work for asking since we moved our tuesday meeting to tomorrow, there's some kind of IBM event today, and my eta was getting close to 10:30, if I was actually needed at armonk. She told me mostly everyone on the team wasn't even at Armonk today so I'd be going there for nothin.
Bill: So rather than the remaining 2 hours up, and inevitable 2 hours back, I took the 15 minutes to come home
Bill: best scenario would have been knowing this yesterday, but I didn't think to ask until late lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof
Bill: Obviously this is better than Armonk, don't get me wrong. It just feels like my day should be over cause I commuted and came back 😅

Bill: Happ Anni? Is that the 'happ borth' version of happy anniversary? 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): HAP WED
Bill: ooo ye that better
Bill: I make stupid jokes at my boss and when I change jobs sometime in the future it'll bite me in the ass XD
Bill: > Saves receipt for ticket payment
> realizes I should print it since I have a file cabinet
> realizes printing doesn't involve going to the basement and figuring out if any the printer is on/still connected to Dad's crazy network
Bill: Which was almost a perfect moment, cept I forgot where the paper gets loaded so I still got beeped at by the printer XD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Y’all which one should I get
Kaio Vermino (Lee): First one o3o
Aldus Larian (Jess): first one <:rise:582318089228648456>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): All of them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But of those two, first one
Tikur (Kurtis): First one
Bill: Micheals has sent me multiple emails about sale stuff for fall decorations and I'm starting to feel tempted
Nokri (Marisa): New doorknob!! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> 
We splurged a few extra dollars to get the fancy side handle kind so people outside would stop trying to turn the handle, because this kind can’t move when the door is locked unlike the last one you could turn and jiggle even if it was locked
Nokri (Marisa): This one also can’t be opened with a credit card
Nokri (Marisa): Found out the old doorknob was broken off because BoJo locked her keys in the house so the only way to get in was to break the doorknob off
Bill: No spare keys?
Nokri (Marisa): They in the house <:pew:543202259085950996>
Nokri (Marisa): I think we only had a spare for the deadbolt anyway
Bill: Not very helpful there 😅 Maybe you give one to your sister?
Nokri (Marisa): We don’t have enough extra keys tho
Nokri (Marisa): With this new lock we have two keys so that’s enough for BoJo and I
Nokri (Marisa): If I’m away again though it’ll have to get broken off again. Good thing she keeps a mallet in the car
Aldus Larian (Jess): you can get a copy at lowes or home depot or possibly walmart. its usually only a few dollars
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think we paid like 2 dollars for ours?
Nokri (Marisa): There’s a place near the fabric shop we work at where they do it toWHAT REALLY?
Bill: Ye, i was trying to find confirmation of the price but I don't think it's more than 5 bucks. That HAS to be cheaper than a brand new doorknob.
Nokri (Marisa): <:woah:543194447345876998>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEEAH!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Cool doorknob tho
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Just go up to someone in the store hand them to key and be like, copy this
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And they'll do it and give you a reciept
Nokri (Marisa): New doorknob was about $30 yeah <:rip:369476083248267274>
It only happens every few years that we have to break the doorknob but maybe Crissy and holly having a spare wouldn’t be too bad
Bill: Yeah, please make copies.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea duplicate keys are pretty cheap u just but the blank key and the grind it for free i think?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Speaking of which I should copy my car key lmao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I have 1
Bill: Hell, give one to Andrew for a worst case scenario, he's trustworthy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont think your car key can be copied hun 🤔
Bill: That's 30 bucks you've save everytime you go away and Bojo forgets hers!
Nokri (Marisa): Usually we can break in ourselves without destroying the doorknob but we also burglar proofed the house too much to try that haha oops
Bill: If there are electronics in the car key, it can't be copied except by the dealership.
Nokri (Marisa): Why would a car key have electronics in it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you can get car keys copied but you have to do it through the manufacturer usually
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i know mine cant have copies unless i go to Hyundai
Bill: And car key copies are over 100 bucks minimum~~ 😒
Nokri (Marisa): Road trip to japan to get jess a car key copy let’s go
Aldus Larian (Jess): my car came with 2 but toms only came with one
Aldus Larian (Jess): but my cars Korean 😮
Aldus Larian (Jess): toms is Japanese tho
Bill: They must have bought it from whoever without getting the second key 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the place I bought my car from said they have a guy that comes in occasionally to cut keys so if you can get a cheap blank key off ebay he'd be able to copy your key. Been meaning to do that for the past 2 years but never got around to it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I, too, have only one key
Bill: Mine came with two too so I think that's the standard from a dealership.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea cars some with 2 but the previous owner didnt give the second key, either they lost is or they just didnt turn it in
Bill: Ye
Nokri (Marisa): We have one car key but two of the electronic unlocker things because we use that as a backup alarm, if something happens and we need help we hit the car alarm to draw attention
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.ebay.com/itm/GENUINE-Uncut-Key-Blank-for-2011-2015-Hyundai-Sonata-Tucson-OEM-819963S000/233058858975?fits=Make%3AHyundai&epid=544331523&hash=item364363f7df:g:h2wAAOSwYwZcG-87:sc:USPSFirstClass!19533!US!-1
Nokri (Marisa): Fun arts and craft project
Aldus Larian (Jess): my car not there RIP
Bill: ~~I'm suspicious of anything that has to state 'genuine' in the description~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what car do you have
Aldus Larian (Jess): 2015 veloster but i dont need a duplicate, tom does
Aldus Larian (Jess): 2013**
Aldus Larian (Jess): toms is 2015 civic
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh lol
Nokri (Marisa): we used to use the alarms a lot now that I think about it but not anymore. our assigned parking spot is near a dumpster and ||there used to be a prostitution ring by the dumpster or sometimes people who’d sit in cars and masterbate next to the dumpster and it was really hard to get to our car sometimes when that was happening|| but the police took care of it after a few months.
Aldus Larian (Jess): AHHHHH
Aldus Larian (Jess): you neighborhood scawy 😭
Nokri (Marisa): That was in 2015-2016! Now we only have gangs and drug dealing and drug usage!
Aldus Larian (Jess): das scawy too 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): i need to go grocery shopping but that is not what i wanna do on my anniversary XD
Nokri (Marisa): ROMANTIC GROCERY SHOPPING
Buy each other lots of chocolates and roses!! Get dressed up!! Buy scented candles!! Talk in a fancy accent while shopping!!
Nokri (Marisa): Grocery shopping together is always a big milestone in Shoujo anime/manga
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hate grocery shopping 😭
Nokri (Marisa): Try amazon!
Nokri (Marisa): Online grocery shopping’
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I'm aware it's dealership only copy, but if still like one
El🆓de Faun (Tom): And that it's big bucks
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo ya i mean is spence but prob cheaper then having to call a locksmith to open your car and then having to get your car fixed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): tom what car do you have
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Civic 2016
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~i thought it was a 15?~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah I think your right
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Unsure now lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think mine 13 and yours is 15
Tikur (Kurtis): You can go to home Depot and get a key made for cheap y'all
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not for cars
Tikur (Kurtis): It's what I did for my Jeep
Tikur (Kurtis): Good keys those were, nice and solid
Aldus Larian (Jess): new cars you cant
Aldus Larian (Jess): well most of the time
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz new cars have and electronic component or some shit
Bill: mhmm
Bill: which is for anti theft iirc
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): depends on car. mine's a 13 and just has a normal key and a separate fob
Tikur (Kurtis): 
Tikur (Kurtis): <@351785752197201920>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mines like this but the dealership told me they have to program it or something, unless thats just the remote
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's just for the fob
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo ok yea that would make more sense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which can usually be done by you if you find the instructions
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): usually involves turning the key so many times and unlocking the door and other weird bullshit
Bill: There is also electronics in the key head
Bill: Checks are like business cards, you keep having to update on the information on them but you've only used 4 of the original order uop
Nokri (Marisa): why would you have to keep updating your checks? :0
Bill: Address changed.
Nokri (Marisa): ooo
Nokri (Marisa): but that doesn't happen too frequently
Bill: I know I ordered some this year cause I never got any for chase, so it feels really soon to be ordering more
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea lol i use like one a month to pay my rent and then one every 3 months to cut my hair. i had to throw out a bunch when we got married
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh no my kititen checks are useless now 😭
Bill: 
Bill: Pretty good discount.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the first time I ordered checks I made the mistake of getting like, 3 boxes
Bill: ~~is budd lake sussex county I don't actually know~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Morris
Bill: oop fuck ye
Bill: Almost gave the DMV the wrong info <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I did a bunch of my change of address stuff yesterday. Updated my license online <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Does anyone @here have any interest in going to see chad daniels in New York october Saturday the 12th, 8pm? He's a comedian, I'd probably spend the day in NYC as well. If no one wants to go with, I'm going to consider the 11th 8pm show instead, since the 12th the peak leaves in Jersey and I'd like to plan a shoot of *something* then.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tom and I will be in DC that weekend
