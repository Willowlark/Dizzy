Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I just bought groceries and, like an idiot,  put them on the kitchen floor. Damn cat sliced into my new package of ground beef. Should I just chuck it now, or scoop out the bits by the torn plastic and cook it? Like, I'm torn between throwing out and wasting a pound of beef, and eating cooked beef that has been touched by cat teeth and/or paws
Bill: I'd chuck it.
Bill: ~~into sausage <:pew:543202259085950996>~~
Nokri (Marisa): Cook it for your cat
Aldus Larian (Jess): id throw out the touched parts
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Cat claws and teeth have a lot of bacteria, more than dogs, I'd chuck it. Or in the least chuck the parts that were touched
Bill: You have no idea what was on the kitchen floor either.
Nokri (Marisa): give the cat the meat you monstesr
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah cat paws are gross. Probs gonna scoop off the top layer
Nokri (Marisa): i hold my cat's paw all the time
i'm honored when she steps on me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also don't want to risk giving the cat people food meat because he's on meds right now for parasites and more that I'm typing that I'm realizing I probably should just throw it out

Bill: All the components are on sale but's still super expensive, but I need my own when I move out...
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~whats an NAS~~
Bill: Network Access Storage.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo
Bill: It's a private cloud basically.
Bill: Me and Dad have one at home, I back up all my photos to it.
Bill: It's redunant, so if a disk fails I don't lose any of my data.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Bill: Even if I cut down on the storage compared to the one we have, it's still going to be around a thousand dollars though.
Bill: I do not know if it's worth it right now, cause I have no idea when I'm moving out.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh shit.
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: It's a lot.
Nokri (Marisa): what if your private cloud evaporates
it's really hot
Bill: It's over sixteen hundred to do the same configuration we have now.
Bill: When it's not on sale.
Bill: If I half the space, I can get it for 850~900.
Andrew: Is it bad theres nothing i really want from Prime day
Andrew: Id just be buying for the sake of the sale
Nokri (Marisa): No it‚Äôs good because workers are striking right now
Nokri (Marisa): I didn‚Äôt want to buy anything but that price on cat food was literally unbearable üò≠
Bill: Fuck I gotta decide don't I.
Bill: I forgot about this.
