Bill: <@!228287793099440128> there electronic recycling in Roxbury? Byram doesn't have one and I got old machines to recycle.
Bill: Well.
バナナ: no clue, i just know the last time i went to the recycling center, they just had everything tosses in 1 pile
バナナ: tossed*
Bill: http://www.spartacameraclub.org/ <@!351471675843411978> This what Gabi used(?) to do?
Bill: There's a maker space in totowa. They have open house nights on thursday. https://www.meetup.com/Maker-Depot-makerspace/
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Not really sure
Bill: Me: *my parents have off today, I'mma be jealous of them doing not work things
Parents: *going car shopping*
Me: *sips tea*
Me: *Work sounds good*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): seems like a shit day to go car shopping
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): walking around a parking lot in 2 degree weather? no thanks
Bill: It's a big deal to them to be able to go during the day, see the cars in the sun, test drive in the day... etc.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea, freeze their asses off, get chapped lips
Bill: Also had a dream about OoT era LoZ. It covered the defeat of Ganon, but what I really remember is after Link goes back to being a kid, he goes back to the caslte and finds the missing tomb of Zelda's parents. It was like, under the moat and he guides her in. Really cute moment.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Huh
Dirty Lego (Tom): Neeto
N🆗ri (Marisa): Make an anime about it
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nya
Bill: maybe sinatra wasn't a good idea for music...
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): EXCUSE
Dirty Lego (Tom): Sinatra is always a good idea
Bill: ~~Not when literally all of his lyrics are romantic~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): come one guys, saw that one coming a mile away
バナナ: "that lady... Is a tramp" -fanky boi
Bill: Look BNE and all this Adam incel talk is botherin me a bit okay.
Bill: Sinatra QUALEETEE, But more rock and roll mood today.
Dirty Lego (Tom): ~~Don't worry I did too~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they're not talking about you....
Bill: I know, just makes me think that sometimes it's not luck, it's the person.
Bill: They'll *eventually* drop the whole thing.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not luck for what?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did everybody know that Tupac died in the 90s
Bill: why people like each other. etc. tldr what if the reason I have never had a relationship despite being older than 75% of BNE is I'm a problem person. It's just low self esteem and that I'm not really in the 'there's someone for everyone' kinda mood these days.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what does that have to do with people discussing that people who defend a dangerous stalker are potentially dangerous themselves?
Bill: loser males?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe now that you know about Tupac’s death you’ll have more luck because that fact absolutely blew me out of the water. 
Is this discussion happening in spoilers?
Bill: oooh cardinal is back.
N🆗ri (Marisa): O ya I see it now it wasn’t loading. I think BNE gets a little carried away with their characterizations sometimes but it’s in good fun.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats not at all the same thing?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not having dated doesn't make you a creepy incel
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can’t believe Tupac is dead
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): girl tupac been dead like your whole life
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know that’s the crazy part
N🆗ri (Marisa): Does everybody know this
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~ye~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is crazy
Bill: No but it makes me feel *abnormal* and I dun't like that.
Bill: I'm so glad I bought tea for home.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but they arnt talking about people who haven't dated, they are talking about a group of people that exhibit dangerous attitudes towards women
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not he same thing
Bill: Not the same thing. Just makes me think.
Bill: Wow. I'm looking through Dad's music. He must have really liked Stray Cats, he has tons of albums for them. ~~And he never plays them I guess~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): obviously you are uncomfortable discussing this so ill stop trying to talk about it
Bill: I mean, I'm just trying to cut down on the public unsocited angst. It has to be annoying.
Bill: It's exactly what I said tho. They're talking about loser guys, I draw a few parallels, QED. They've (probably) never dated, I've never dated, suddenly even though I don't make a habit of gaslighting people I see similarity and that's yuck.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): your just assuming though
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they could also have 3 girlfriends at once and be cheating on them all
Bill: sure. Then I question whats wrong with me that that douchebag has *3 girlfriends*. The what if game is dangerous.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): it has nothing to do with you
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats the bottom line
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just start asking people
Guys that have three girlfriends probably ask out every single girl they come across
Bill: It shouldn't. Just have to believe that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Walk up to a group of girls and be like “looks like you ladies just caught tape worm” and wink
Bill: WOW Marisa.
Bill: oof.
Bill: Logic:
Run a query for the count of every expense_type in a database: <60 seconds.
Run a query for the same thing, but only on one month: almost 5 minutes.
Bill: How.
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s your nickname from hazel cosplayer remember 
Guaranteed pickup line
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You know incels are like “nice guys” that think that women are garbage and that they’re owed sex
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): By having female friends that actually appreciate you, you’ve proven you’re not an incel
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ergo, they’re not talking about anything remotely related to you
バナナ: ☝
バナナ: RIP 2pac and B.I.G
Bill: It's not that literal frens. I'm not associating to the incel behavior, it's the 'being a social reject' part. Because that a fear of mine, even when you take dating history out of it. Am I abnormal for reason X, in this case having a trait I assume is shared with that group of social rejects? Which is not true, one trait does not define a person, but it's a _fear_ and hard to just turn off. One day maybe I'll have counter evidence (something I take comfort in facing challenges) to defuse it into a non factor. Right now I don't.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i get it now it's the paralyzing self insecurity i gotchu
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We're just trying to reassure you that you don't need to be afraid of that
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ok but youre not a social reject
Bill: Thank you Jessu ❤
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you a normal dude
Dirty Lego (Tom): Although some of bne's hive mind with characterization does make me uncomfortable too <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> couldn't say why, maybe I feel like I've I'm missing something
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~im just uncomfortable with the bee fanaticism~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea they tend to bandwagon alot which i totally get, just don't feel personally attacked.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Probably I feel blocked from voicing any opinions that may not line up with some of the group's views.
Not like anything I say will oppose them, just don't want them to think less of me for having different opinions. 
And yeah I don't think I've been as passionate about characters as they are in a long ass time lmao.
Dirty Lego (Tom): It's scary man
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~thats probably why the hal hate took off harder than i thought it would~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~and the same reason everyones in bee fever~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i mean i dont voice all my opinions to them either
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yea truu
Bill: For me it's less the characterization and more the reacting to real people.
Bill: But I get chu.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they break down complex characters into oversimplified charactitures of one facet of their personality :0
Bill: I wouldn't have brought up my dissatisfaction with Adam dying so early if you didn't start in that direction Tom.
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah that bothers me a bit too but they are allowed to
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): alot of pople boil down characters to specfic traits, hell people do that with real people
Dirty Lego (Tom): Like I think the scene was good and i have no problem with yang and Blake, I think they fit. It just felt speedy zoom, like Voltron
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): after thinking about i think blake and yang were at least clser than lance and allura tho
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah for sure lmao
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~like allura was disgusted with lance in earlier seasons from what i saw~~
Bill: Ye, but they definately haven't been 'hinting at it for 6 years' either.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): tru
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and theres also the whole "i wasnt looking for that cuz i didnt ship it" thing
Dirty Lego (Tom): Ooh and Yang's sudden lack of caring for ruby
Dirty Lego (Tom): Cry evrytiem
N🆗ri (Marisa): throw All Our Days out the window
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea thats bs
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sisters before hoes
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oo and a big pet peeves I have with series is when they make villians pure evil
Dirty Lego (Tom): With no redeemable traits
Dirty Lego (Tom): Yona avoids this super well and I applaud them for it
Dirty Lego (Tom): And Thanos too
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea moral grey characters are much more interesting
N🆗ri (Marisa): did you say yona
N🆗ri (Marisa): sorry i thought my caps lock was on
N🆗ri (Marisa): DID YOU SAY YPNA
N🆗ri (Marisa): YONAAA
N🆗ri (Marisa): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
N🆗ri (Marisa): i love yona
and morally grey characters yeah those too
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): _marisa we gotta cosplay yona together so i finish yona_
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): like i was so close to her being done until _circumstances_
N🆗ri (Marisa): we can do a whole group i will cosplay literally anyone i can pull off from that series
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have yona and gigan costumes, and materials for yoon but i could do zeno/shin-ah maybe? or lili
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know cosplayers of every yona character to fill in the blanks
Dirty Lego (Tom): The only two I've considered is shin ah and yoon
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i wanna do shin-ah
N🆗ri (Marisa): shin-ah fight
Dirty Lego (Tom): Shin ah had the coolest design lmao, not surprising
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): my mononoke hood can double as a shinah capey hood thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll be ao
Dirty Lego (Tom): And uuuhhhh
Dirty Lego (Tom): Su-on....
Dirty Lego (Tom): Def spelled that wrong
Dirty Lego (Tom): You know who I mean

N🆗ri (Marisa): his bow is smaller now because he needs more muscle to carry the emotional baggage
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh i actually have the exact pattern for ray's jacket. freaky.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Accurate
N🆗ri (Marisa): now that i know it'll be easy to make him i can put off doing it for longer
N🆗ri (Marisa): Look at that the collar is exactly the same and all. Just gotta shorten it and shorten the lapel a little. Wow. A true Christmas miracle.
