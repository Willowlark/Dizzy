Bill: Half of my closet gone through. The keeps pile is far smaller than the donate. I have 5 shirts I actually like the look of.
Bill: 6 that are tolerable.
Bill: Must be two dozen t shirts I've filtered out cause they don't fit right anymore.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Time for shopping
Bill: Yeah really.
Bill: Trying to build up motivation for the flannels and button ups.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Clothes sorting is a pain
Bill: Shame I can't do baggy as a look.
Bill: rip my flannels. They're all too big and I only kept a handful for the option.
Nokri (Marisa): take them in
Bill: Should have took a before.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Organize
Tikur (Kurtis): Nice job!
Bill: Donations.
Nokri (Marisa): smashed potateos
El🆓de Faun (Tom): WOO NICE
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That sweet organization
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Why do cheap ac window units have 1-7 if only 6.5-7 actually works 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so im leaning more towards taking the NASA internship
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and instead graduating in 5 years because id be taking a semester off to do such an internship
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): in case anyone was wondering what ive been thinking up to decision day (tuesday night)
Aldus Larian (Jess): Awesome!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _its very stressful weighing the options ahhh_
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I can imagine. But I think it's a really great opportunity and there's nothing wrong with delaying graduation esspecialy for something like that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Agreed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And endless of literally anything, having fucking NASA on your resume is gonna look fucking great to literally any future employer
Bill: A lot of people take 5 years to graduate these days. It’s not a stigma anymore.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I took 2.5 for community cuz I was working and didn't wanna stuff my last semester with 7 classes and 25 hrs of work
Bill: Graduation timelines are more flexible in college.
Bill: It's not like high school where if it took longer than 4 years it's *weird*.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye
Bill: Me: What should I listen to today
My head, with here comes the sun stuck in it: 😑 
Me: Oh the beatles
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEA thats what the physics advisor said
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): at first he said it wasnt worth it because i wouldnt get to accomplish my senior year goals
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but taking a 5th year means i can take the internship AND accomplish those
Bill: You'll be disjointed from classmates going forward. You'll be taking classes with your underclassman rather than the people you know now.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean Sam is a year behind me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Tyler is also taking 5 years
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I’m okay there lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nice!
Bill: Sounds like everything works out for you.
Bill: oooh. That Weiss meme artist I share a bit is doing commissions.
Bill: ,... not sure how to communicate over tumblr, I just sent an ask.
Nokri (Marisa): there's a chat function on tumblr
Bill: I think I found that but it said closed to mutuals.
Bill: Was auto added to the discord server they run when I did the dollar tier on their patreon (cause it's a dollar shrug) so I guess I can message there too.
Bill: ~~if your server needs a channel directory you have too many channels~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I think summer takes a toll on my creative energy
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oddly enough

El🆓de Faun (Tom): BIG EAR
Dizzy: You should choose do the one thing I actually need and move on to something relevant
Bill: !choose waste time creating a perfect replica of a stopwatch in code, do the one thing I actually need and move on to something relevant
Nokri (Marisa): looks kind of. nothing like the character <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Nokri (Marisa): naw but it does look like that
El🆓de Faun (Tom): SHIT
Bill: It's SO familiar.
Nokri (Marisa): i have another pic with a filter but it's unphotoshopped, if i shop that it might be a little more obvious
Bill: Dragon tales? Was there a fairy in dragon tales.

Nokri (Marisa): 50 points to tom and 5 points to biru
Nokri (Marisa): naw, nose just looks dumb
El🆓de Faun (Tom): NAH
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I think it's close enough
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If you wanted to go all out and do the nose I think it would look good also
Nokri (Marisa): I shopped the tiny white girl dog nose on but it looks meh, a prosthetic would work wonders
Bill: I actually just spent a half hour building a lap capable stopwatch in python just because.
Nokri (Marisa): Like a cat but it’s a snake
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@301927856240459777>

Bill: short and sweet, like `lap`.
Nokri (Marisa): Go/No
Bill: can't use the slash.
Nokri (Marisa): go_no
Bill: No doesn't quite work.
Nokri (Marisa): go
Nokri (Marisa): you know what was cool

Nokri (Marisa): im tryna find but they're so elusive
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I know exactly what you mean tho, there was a ton
Bill: Wow fuck tumblr asks, I can't include links.
Nokri (Marisa): No urls because people would bait children and hack users who clicked on links and send around general spam
Nokri (Marisa): Also, no letters immediately after a period
Nokri (Marisa): The system thinks that’s a url
Nokri (Marisa): If they responded to your ask publicly you can just reblog it with the link
Bill: I'mma message over discord cause tumblr weird.
Bill: today was productive.
Bill: Enjoyable even.
Bill: I almost want to keep working, I got nothing better to do.
