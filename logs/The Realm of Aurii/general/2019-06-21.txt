watch
El🆓de Faun (Tom): woah thats a complicated history
El🆓de Faun (Tom): and its something like find the killer?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): also is sandbox different from the original
Nokri (Marisa): The epic mafia game is yee!
The typical epic mafia sandbox setup is 12 players. 7 town, 3 mafia, and 2 third parties. Town has to kill all the mafia and hostile thirds, mafia has to outnumber all the other players, or thirds have to achieve their goal for the game to end. It’s also called werewolf if you’ve played that, same thing but with like 150 roles. 

The .ORG that we’re playing is like the reality show big brother (sandbox big brother, sbbb). Every week there’s a challenge (I made a sweet video for a propaganda challenge that won last time) and a vote for who gets kicked out.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): or is it a do whatever enironment like typical sandbox games
Nokri (Marisa): Sandbox is just non competitive. We’re there for a good time. Competitive will pick you apart psychologically and leave you sobbing on the ground then kick you while you’re down while sandbox will just kind of beat you up.
Nokri (Marisa): week
webtoon
wonderwall
El🆓de Faun (Tom): sandbox version is more casual then
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ohh and i gotcha
El🆓de Faun (Tom): so ive never really played werewolf
El🆓de Faun (Tom): like half a game 1 time
El🆓de Faun (Tom): so im kinda out of the loop
Nokri (Marisa): Ooooo
~~you should join epicmafia I hear lucid is back trying to revive it~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): so each role has an ability im assuming
El🆓de Faun (Tom): also in classic the mafia people are trying to kill everyone without being caught?
Nokri (Marisa): Yup, like cop can see if someone is aligned with the town or with the mafia (then there’s insane cop, lazy cop, paranoid cop, etc. that are all variations), Doctor can stop someone from being killed, sniper has a gun that can anonymously kill someone during the day, and so on

Yup! The mafia is trying not to get caught while the town is trying to find and kill the mafia. The town lynches someone every day and if they lynch a town member then that’s good for the mafia
Nokri (Marisa): Then you have third parties like the fool, who wins if you lynch them, or the lyncher who is assigned a random innocent player and they win if you lynch that player (so the lyncher tries to make up evidence that that person is mafia, and the fool will try to incriminate themselves)
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ohhh!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): thats neet yeah
El🆓de Faun (Tom): so theres dialogue then?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): like for each round do you get to say so many things?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OH and is anyone allowed to say thier role
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah! It’s entirely chat based, I’ll take a screenshot next time I play. Sandbox is very chill though, to the point where you can be like “fool here” and maybe everyone will lynch you, whereas that’s bannable in competitive. 
You can say as much as you want but if you speak too much you get timed out for spam for 20 seconds
There are some roles that affect your speech though, like Cthulhu makes it so that your text becomes garbled nonsense or silencer makes it so you can’t talk at all
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah! You can
El🆓de Faun (Tom): lmao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): silenceer
El🆓de Faun (Tom): tahts awfu
Nokri (Marisa): Whether anyone believes you or not varies but often when it’s lynch or lose (the town has to kill someone or they lose) everyone starts saying their role
Nokri (Marisa): People usually signal that they’re silenced by desperately flashing random votes in a call for help
El🆓de Faun (Tom): lmao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): then noone can ever understand cthulu players?
Nokri (Marisa): Librarian makes it so you can only talk in whispers (directly to another player and not in the big chat), lightkeeper and blinder make everyone anonymous, fiddler makes it so you can talk but can’t see anything that’s being said
Nokri (Marisa): Yuuuup, it’s all gibberish, if you type “I found the mafia!” It’ll come out as “Thanh! Jd djs .)hdksjdk”
Nokri (Marisa): Sometimes people who are trees like to mess with the chat and type in gibberish to create a fake Cthulhu panic
Nokri (Marisa): There’s a list
https://epicmafia.com/role
Nokri (Marisa): Oh wow there’s actually over 70 people in the server. The viewing lounge has a list of everyone in it
El🆓de Faun (Tom): oh wow damn
El🆓de Faun (Tom): guess its not THAT dead
El🆓de Faun (Tom): so when did you start then, since you started around ham steak time?
El🆓de Faun (Tom): hamsteak started taking off in my senior year odf highschool, all the freshman were talking about it
El🆓de Faun (Tom): then i graduated
El🆓de Faun (Tom): so 2010?
Aldus Larian (Jess): 2011
Aldus Larian (Jess): is when we graduated
El🆓de Faun (Tom): yaeh but i think it was slightly before
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Nokri (Marisa): Around then sounds right <:thinku:543194478614413318> maybe 2012
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I forget that you guys are older than me and were probably a year ahead of me in school
Aldus Larian (Jess): when did u graduate? 😮
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 2012
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I was on the older side of my class and *could have* been in the 2011 class if my parents started me in kindergarten a year earlier
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo ok yea cuz you were also born in 93 right?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yup
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeeee me and tom are on the younger side of our class so makes sense
Bill: Ron Swanson making my anxiety feel worthy like a GOD

Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So my sister finally took her cat to her and her husband's house and my parents are a little upset. My mom kept telling the cat to pee and throw up everywhere in her house.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My sister was like, even if he did, he'd still stay with us
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She's annoyed that my parents are so possessive of *her* cat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They brought him over to their house like a year ago and he was super scared and just hid under the couch or bed, but now he seems to be doing better. I guess maybe because more of my sister's stuff is there so it smells more like her
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But last night he killed a mouse like a champ and was cuddly so my sister was like HA!
Aldus Larian (Jess): awwww yea thats the hard part about pets
Aldus Larian (Jess): but he is her cat so she has every right
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I posted a link on my parent's FB that the Humane's Society is having a free pet adoption day this weekend. I was like *how convenient*
Bill: I called out. I’ve been fighting something for a week and I need a day to attempt to get over it.
Bill: I woke up without the knot in my stomach I’ve been attributing to anxiety (which I totally attribute to dreaming about piloting zoids), so today’s a good day to focus on keeping that healing going.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): feel better dude ❤
Bill: Thanks Erik.

Aldus Larian (Jess): Huh ironic
Nokri (Marisa): The record of people complimenting my blood goes unbroken
Aldus Larian (Jess): great blood 10/10
Nokri (Marisa): doctors and nurses really like the color
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): what type are you?
Tikur (Kurtis): Vampire Recommended
Nokri (Marisa): I don’t know what my blood type is <:woah:543194447345876998> I should ask that
Nokri (Marisa): Or test it myself. We learned how to do that in high school
Nokri (Marisa): We weren’t allowed to test it on ourselves in school though how rude
Aldus Larian (Jess): you can test yourself? 😮
Aldus Larian (Jess): how
Tikur (Kurtis): Is it possible to learn this power?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.homesciencetools.com/product/eldoncard-blood-test-kit/
Nokri (Marisa): yee, you can get one of those kits!
there are a bunch of circles and you drop your blood (casually) into each circle and mix it with a certain compound that reacts to specific types of blood. like, one circle will have the compound that reacts to type A, another will have type B, and so on. the circle where your blood starts coagulating (or coagulates the most) is what you have
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just donate blood and they gave me a card that tells me what I have lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~and then they bombard me with emails and phones calls because my type is "always in high demand"~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ooo i dont know what i am
Nokri (Marisa): erik do you have ab-
or golden blood
Nokri (Marisa): or o-
Nokri (Marisa): you should start saving your own blood
Nokri (Marisa): keep some safe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): O+
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): universal donor to positive types
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Do mosquitos like you Marisa, o heard blood type determines that somewhat
Nokri (Marisa): i dunno i never go outside
