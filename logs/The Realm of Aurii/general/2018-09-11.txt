Nokri (Marisa): Eyy some dark stuff to talk about

For the suicide prevention day thing, I see a lot of people posting ‚Äúwarning signs‚Äù which is great for people to watch out for (like talking about death or harm), but they‚Äôre missing some crucial ones. 
That be, if someone who was previously obviously excessively depressed is suddenly better out of the blue. People will act happier when they‚Äôve settled on a date and method because they‚Äôre relieved it‚Äôs almost over. 
If someone starts selling or giving away their stuff and becomes unconcerned with their personal property. They figure they aren‚Äôt going to need it much longer and others can put it to better use.
Nokri (Marisa): That first sign is especially dangerous because it means they‚Äôre going to act very very soon.
