Dizzy: You should choose watch anime & edit photos
Bill: !choose write fanfic, play over watch, watch anime & edit photos
Bill: Shit. Dave Chapelles new stand up calls out the LGBTQ community for creating cancel culture. No wonder the click bait article said its controversial.
Kaio Vermino (Lee): it was really good ngl... but also yea controversial
Bill: Oh I’m enjoying it.
Bill: People won’t like it tho.
Bill: You can see him smile right after he says a joke he knows is going to get blasted on tumblr. It’s great.
Nokri (Marisa): **the coat**
Aldus Larian (Jess): Kitty?

Aldus Larian (Jess): Nice kitty

Nokri (Marisa): today’s a holiday?? Is that why there’s no mail aaaaa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye it labor day
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeeeee
Nokri (Marisa): what’s the point of Labor Day <:woah:543194447345876998>
Nokri (Marisa): All the laborers are still working
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeeee
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It's like, the people with the shittiest jobs have to work
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Like thanks america
Nokri (Marisa): I like how they do it in japan. If one day is a holiday, restaurants and tourist attractions and stores and all are still open, but they’re closed the next day when government stuff is open again

So like if 9/2 was a national holiday, government jobs get off and everywhere else would be open, but on 9/3 they all get a day off
Nokri (Marisa): But my sister works for the government and still has work today <:thinku:543194478614413318>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Whatatt
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Me and Jess have off
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Wack
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm off today
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT take me with you
Nokri (Marisa): I’m in the hoa office
Nokri (Marisa): I reorganized two filing cabinets
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Are they getting properly super organized?
Nokri (Marisa): Haha no
My instructions for reorganization was to take everything out and put it in a box, take any papers not in a folder and put them in a folder of loose papers, then put everything back into the cabinet. They’re in absolutely no order. BoJo has a folder in here that’s like, pictures of her in high school? Next to a folder containing third party payment information from 2016
Nokri (Marisa): I wanted to organize them alphabetically but they said no because no one would be able to find them <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Zeikani was talking about how many friend requests she gets to a fake Facebook and look who she may know.
Nokri (Marisa): all creeps eh
Nokri (Marisa): w-why did she post it on instragram
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Instagram won't load pictures for me atm :/
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Also watched that Dave Chapelle special, not as good as his last imo :/
Nokri (Marisa): is there a reason she posted me to her instagram story 👀  should i be concerned
Nokri (Marisa): too late i'm concerned
Nokri (Marisa): did i do something to offend her? have i ever even met zeikani
Nokri (Marisa): <@!184437198865563648> when you get a minute can you come back and provide context so i don't cry at the office ;u;
Nokri (Marisa): please i would be very thankful
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I wish I could view the picture :(
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Let me try my desktop
Nokri (Marisa): i could only open it by clicking 'open original' on the bottom
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OH your  in their cuz luck
El🆓de Faun (Tom): the top category is whos shes talking about
Nokri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Nokri (Marisa): b-but why
El🆓de Faun (Tom): LUCK
El🆓de Faun (Tom): just because you have a bunch of mutuals
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I think it's just a coincidence
El🆓de Faun (Tom): she didnt feel like cropping it
Nokri (Marisa): why didn't she crop it then <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> i feel like there's more going on i bet she hates me
El🆓de Faun (Tom): shes talking about the friend requests
El🆓de Faun (Tom): "not people you may know"
Nokri (Marisa): but then why would she scroll down to the bottom ;u;
El🆓de Faun (Tom): she probably would ahve cropped it if it was close friends only
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i'm sorry for freaking out over something so stupid~~
El🆓de Faun (Tom): its not scrolled down
El🆓de Faun (Tom): she only has 5 requests
Nokri (Marisa): o?
Bill: Oh no, you have nothing to do with what she was posting silly.
Nokri (Marisa): but isn't there usually something at the top that says friend requests
Nokri (Marisa): are you **sure**
Bill: You just happened to be at the bottom of the list.
Nokri (Marisa): she hates me ;u;
El🆓de Faun (Tom): she definetly does not hate you
Bill: She has three slides of scrolling through the friend request tab before she gets to the bottom, where the people you may know section starts.
Bill: Different sections.
Nokri (Marisa): AHA THERE WAS MORE
Bill: Yes, irrelevant to seeing you in the different section tho.
Nokri (Marisa): me irl
Bill: You have nothing to do with her post, you just happened to be in the next section.
Bill: Oke?
Nokri (Marisa): i have offended her in the highest possible manner and must attone for my sins
Nokri (Marisa): where's that link to sudoku erik posted
Bill: ,...
Bill: Please don’t get a weird/afraid attitude towards her because of a joke I made...

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok Tom's pic loaded
Nokri (Marisa): HACKS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's where I'm at with the exception of the 6 in the top center
El🆓de Faun (Tom): All I needed was like one or two more numbers passed that and I was able to solve the rest
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can I trust that 6?
Nokri (Marisa): i have a six there too
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Lmao do how I got it there is that 5 and 9 can only go there in that box so I was able to erase the other 6
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oooh thank
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The day everyone in aurii committed sudoku
El🆓de Faun (Tom): For harder puzzles using sub sets saves my life 🙏
El🆓de Faun (Tom): if you know that three of the squares contain 5,6,7 and nothing else (one is 5,7 one is 6,7 and one is 5.6) you can erase everything else in that row, column or block that contain 5,6,7
El🆓de Faun (Tom): theres also some sort of rectange rule that helps you narrow choices down but taht one is complicated and i always forget how that works
Nokri (Marisa): im so close i have like 10 blocks left
El🆓de Faun (Tom): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> !!!
