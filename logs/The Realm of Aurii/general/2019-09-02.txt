Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ye it labor day
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Yeeeee
Nokri (Marisa): what窶冱 the point of Labor Day <:woah:543194447345876998>
Nokri (Marisa): All the laborers are still working
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Yeeee
El氣電e Faun (Tom): It's like, the people with the shittiest jobs have to work
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Like thanks america
Nokri (Marisa): I like how they do it in japan. If one day is a holiday, restaurants and tourist attractions and stores and all are still open, but they窶决e closed the next day when government stuff is open again

So like if 9/2 was a national holiday, government jobs get off and everywhere else would be open, but on 9/3 they all get a day off
Nokri (Marisa): But my sister works for the government and still has work today <:thinku:543194478614413318>

Nokri (Marisa): I窶冦 in the hoa office
Nokri (Marisa): I reorganized two filing cabinets
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Are they getting properly super organized?
Nokri (Marisa): Haha no
My instructions for reorganization was to take everything out and put it in a box, take any papers not in a folder and put them in a folder of loose papers, then put everything back into the cabinet. They窶决e in absolutely no order. BoJo has a folder in here that窶冱 like, pictures of her in high school? Next to a folder containing third party payment information from 2016
Nokri (Marisa): I wanted to organize them alphabetically but they said no because no one would be able to find them <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Zeikani was talking about how many friend requests she gets to a fake Facebook and look who she may know.
Nokri (Marisa): all creeps eh

Nokri (Marisa): why didn't she crop it then <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> i feel like there's more going on i bet she hates me
El氣電e Faun (Tom): shes talking about the friend requests
El氣電e Faun (Tom): "not people you may know"
Nokri (Marisa): but then why would she scroll down to the bottom ;u;
El氣電e Faun (Tom): she probably would ahve cropped it if it was close friends only
Nokri (Marisa): ~~i'm sorry for freaking out over something so stupid~~
El氣電e Faun (Tom): its not scrolled down
El氣電e Faun (Tom): she only has 5 requests
Nokri (Marisa): o?
Bill: Oh no, you have nothing to do with what she was posting silly.
Nokri (Marisa): but isn't there usually something at the top that says friend requests
Nokri (Marisa): are you **sure**
Bill: You just happened to be at the bottom of the list.
Nokri (Marisa): she hates me ;u;
El氣電e Faun (Tom): she definetly does not hate you
Bill: She has three slides of scrolling through the friend request tab before she gets to the bottom, where the people you may know section starts.
Bill: Different sections.
Nokri (Marisa): AHA THERE WAS MORE
Bill: Yes, irrelevant to seeing you in the different section tho.
Nokri (Marisa): me irl
Bill: You have nothing to do with her post, you just happened to be in the next section.
Bill: Oke?
Nokri (Marisa): i have offended her in the highest possible manner and must attone for my sins
Nokri (Marisa): where's that link to sudoku erik posted

Nokri (Marisa): HACKS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's where I'm at with the exception of the 6 in the top center
El氣電e Faun (Tom): All I needed was like one or two more numbers passed that and I was able to solve the rest
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can I trust that 6?
Nokri (Marisa): i have a six there too
El氣電e Faun (Tom): Lmao do how I got it there is that 5 and 9 can only go there in that box so I was able to erase the other 6
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oooh thank
El氣電e Faun (Tom): The day everyone in aurii committed sudoku
El氣電e Faun (Tom): For harder puzzles using sub sets saves my life 泗
El氣電e Faun (Tom): if you know that three of the squares contain 5,6,7 and nothing else (one is 5,7 one is 6,7 and one is 5.6) you can erase everything else in that row, column or block that contain 5,6,7
El氣電e Faun (Tom): theres also some sort of rectange rule that helps you narrow choices down but taht one is complicated and i always forget how that works
Nokri (Marisa): im so close i have like 10 blocks left
