Bill: I’ve been a lot more sensitive and emotional in the last 6 months and I *hate* it, share some of that confidence Jess.
Aldus Larian (Jess): it sounds weird but... i like experiencing different emotions? like something will make me cry and somewhere inside of my brain im like "yaaas this is living" its really weird. and then i use those feeling for other things later on <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so the field next to our building is prone to flooding when it rains hard because the drain is clogged AF and there's so much water after the past few days of storms that there are ducks swimming in it

Bill: We meme him a lot.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): he hot, but he pretty bad
Bill: It's no a choice on my part, I just don't cry.
Bill: Just to be clear.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea emotional expression is attractive
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its not like anything you see particularly encouraged you to cry growin up tho
Aldus Larian (Jess): imo
Bill: ahaha.
Bill: Good, more reasons to be unattractive.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): emotional expression can be more of a choice tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): as opposed to somethin like hairy feet or an outie bellybutton
Bill: I *do* express my emotions...
Bill: I'm anything but zen.
Aldus Larian (Jess): am i ever not expressing my emotions? 🤔
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i am confused at this convo now

It happens to me every day for no reason woohoo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): here marisa i bring you an apple youll have a reason then
Nokri (Marisa): Spread the salt water on your face it’s good for your skin
Bill: My positive emotions are just... more subtle? That's a word for it.
Bill: The only thing I get outwardly emotional over tends to be anger and it's *usually* passes quickly, unless it's something festering.
Bill: But that's negative self talk keeping it going.
Bill: I guess?
Nokri (Marisa): If you’re uncomfortable with your emotions go to a therapist <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Yeah I brought that up once at dinner and it'd definitely be a contestion point. No idea if my insurance will cover that when I switch in the summer too. >.>
Nokri (Marisa): It made people argue? :0
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it ok to disagree with your fam tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): they want whats best for you but also have their own biases
Bill: It's more a pain to use their insurance for it. I'll do what I want, it's just that layer on top of it that's complicated.
Bill: With all that talk of crying and the exhaustion of this workshop I'm feeling that tension in your cheeks/nose you feel before you start crying and I'm like 'really?'.
Nokri (Marisa): Cry! Cry! Cry!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I would be crying too if I had to sit through what you've been going through this week
Aldus Larian (Jess): Right
Bill: Your sympathy is greatly appreciated.
Bill: I brought my fidget cube with me in from the car cause I was passing out during the first day...
Bill: It has a worry stone side, and I was curious about the history of those so I was googling...
Bill: 
Bill: *Is. The use breaking someone's neck?*
Bill: *Is that therapeutic?*
Nokri (Marisa): Yes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): get rid of the problem altogether?
Bill: Then you have a new problem. Getting rid of the body.
Bill: `Worry stones are also a discreet way to manage anxiety when you are in public. Nervous about a public performance? Keep a stone in your pocket and rub it and watch your anxieties fade away to be replaced with confidence.` Well shit, it was *that* easy.
Bill: Also as you get further down the search results it gets more and more wiccan.
Bill: lol
Bill: 
Bill: 
Bill: *I'm so damn beautiful*
Glonk: That handlebar mustache 👌
Tikur (Kurtis): Beautiful people
