The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): These chocolate sticks of serotonin bring me happiness. They have a pretzel like outside and a smooth chocolate inside that compliment each other nicely. I was recommended these by a good friend, she is a wonderful person with great talent. 11/10 would buy again

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that sounds awful

Bill: 40 minutes of it was me explaining way more about the algorithm in question for Jing to understand what I was asking. Which was frustrating. But she got what I was actually asking about, it was amusing.
Bill: I didn't even feel stupid.
Bill: A rare occurance when math is involved.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I see a pattern but I have no idea what's going on
Bill: Is a mix of statistics, mathmatics, data formatting, patterns...
