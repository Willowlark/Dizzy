Nokri (Marisa): wear a mask. horse mask.
Bill: I look like shit all the time, it’s the feeling that’s a problem. Horse mask can’t cure that.
Nokri (Marisa): u need more selfies. an aisle of fruit roll ups will fix that.

Nokri (Marisa): it's good for your heart
Bill: Really not.
Nokri (Marisa): when people say "mate" idk if they mean their friend or their lover
Elfriede (Tom): Truth
Nokri (Marisa): i think i'm going to resign from my job at the end of september. I wanted to stay until october for the halloween party but that's a ploy to get more clients for teachers, and they might not even let me attend if i'm resigning after that. I can't take 5 classes and teach weekends, i was having difficulty juggling 3 classes and work. my contract is up for renewal at the end of september but maybe i'll just let it expire.
even if i stay on working, i'd have to work before classes and the office is absolutely dead at that time, so if I went to work I wouldn't get paid at all. I've got 2 regulars who've booked me every Friday in September but aside from that my lessons are empty.
Nokri (Marisa): *time for my new job*
https://jobs.gaijinpot.com/job/details/127995/en/food-and-beverage/international-maid-cafe/
Bill: Yeah, focus on school. We need you back for Katsu and you have to pass everything for that.
Bill: *marisa*
Nokri (Marisa): that's me! that's my name hello
Bill: That job sounds sketch as hell.
Bill: And you don't have an Usui-kun to show up in the nick of time.
Nokri (Marisa): they recently got a new website hehe
Afina (Georgia🍀): Con maid cafes are better :V
Bill: ~~Maid cafes that aren’t asking for face shot photos are better~~
Nokri (Marisa): everything in japan asks for face shots it's a required part of most resumes <:rip:369476083248267274>
Afina (Georgia🍀): O rly
Afina (Georgia🍀): Does that mean they're looking for hot people?
Nokri (Marisa): most places ye they go by the 'appearance is everything' saying. office jobs don't care but anything customer service or anything that has you interacting with people u gotta be decent looking
~~it's a miracle i got my job eyy~~
Bill: It’s a maid cafe. It’s about looking cute for the customers.
Nokri (Marisa): they have purikura booths but for resume pictures at every train station
Bill: ~~I’m not worried cause you *aren’t* attractive, I’m worried you’ll be *too* attractive~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): This is the problem in this chat
Afina (Georgia🍀): Everyone is too damn cute
Bill: *speak for yourself*
Bill: I’ve seen Kaichou wa maid sama, I know what can happen.
Nokri (Marisa): the first thing people ask when they meet me is "where are you from"
and America gets a lot of mixed reactions (usually "oh I've been to california" or "ew america")
so occasionally i'll be like "america but my family is romanian" and this one guy who was like 70 said "oh yeah romania has beautiful women" so i kind of walked away
Nokri (Marisa): biru u are the kawaiiest you just need *your magical girl attire*
Elfriede (Tom): We're all beautiful, damn
