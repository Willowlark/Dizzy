Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Haley (Starry) posting cute cosplay selfies in her story got me swooning
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea she touru! (Sp?)
Nokri (Marisa): i just thought of something
museums in 100 years from now probably won't have too many items from famous people
like today we have "the shoes of the king" or "the pillow the queen slept on" of people from 500 years ago, but stuff today is kind of mass-produced junk. maybe we'll have one or two of the queen's dresses/shoes since they're custom made but are they gonna be displaying one of obama's suits or bill gate's car keys?

we might have stuff they created themselves like the first windows computer or a handwritten speech but mundane items that were so expensive and important in the past are trash now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *this is half a blunt that was smoked by Snoop Dog*
Nokri (Marisa): New bow supplies came just in time <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

Bill: I'm hoping the special guests actually come to my town cause on the DS one they never visited.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So one of my friends works at a prison and she was just telling us how someone asked if they could pay someone's bail with Apple Pay and I lost my shit
Andrew: XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm also drunk so it made it even funnier
Andrew: lucky
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She just told another story
Nokri (Marisa): I hear some prisons do take emoney
The special guests in the DS game usually come once a week :0
Bill: It a good party?
Nokri (Marisa): The police men could tell you if someone is in town
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sometimes bail was $50k and his gf called up and was like "ok I'll be there"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rolls in and pays $50k *in cash*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Not all 100s eithet
Nokri (Marisa): Drug dealing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Girl was a porn star

Nokri (Marisa): Or that. Stripper was my second guess
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Took my friend 3 hours (working overtime) to count and verify all the money
Aldus Larian (Jess): Damn
Nokri (Marisa): What did the guy do to get 50k bail?
Nokri (Marisa): Did he say

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel that in my bones
Bill: I got up early and was rewarded with foxesssss
Nokri (Marisa): Join them
Bill: They gone now.
Bill: I wasn‚Äôt able to get the kits playing together on camera but they were The CUTEST thing.
Bill: They were behind the fence. I eventually tried moving to the back deck to get a view but by then they were pretty much scattered.
Bill: I need a quick nap now tho.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why would you voluntarily wake up early damn
Bill: Because... the foxes.... are cute... and it‚Äôs a rare chance to photograph them.
Bill: This is why holy SHIT beautiful animals.
Bill: That's not with exposure correction either cause had to way undershoot to get the shots with the 600mm beast lens.
Bill: But there's QUALITY in here. üíõ
Nokri (Marisa): HIS LEGS
Bill: It SO nice out, we should have planned a fire or going to the beach.
Nokri (Marisa): That‚Äôs arson
Tikur (Kurtis): What about a beach fire
Nokri (Marisa): Bearson
Bill: Place is laser tag summer camp.
Bill: Hahaha rip cause of all the drops we‚Äôre paying 35 a person.
Bill: They‚Äôll give us vouchers for the last 3 though.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Things learned: BNE is not a laser tag crowd by any means
Bill: Oh it‚Äôs 30 I miscounted who came.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is odd because it‚Äôs p fun
Bill: I mean technically. 13 replied to the final headcount before I put down the deposit. 3 of the 5 missing are from here. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Missing?
Bill: You Tom and Jess didn‚Äôt make it.
Bill: Also Jaime and Heather.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O ya I mean I said I was dubious from the get go
Bill: Though we‚Äôve heard NOTHING from Rebecca and Monica today.
Bill: So.
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah didn‚Äôt Georgia, Tom, and Jess say they were a maybe with Tom and Jess leaning towards unable?
Nokri (Marisa): They also didn‚Äôt respond to the rally
Bill: Just going from the mark on the post when I put down the deposit.
Bill: Anyway it is what it is.
Nokri (Marisa): When does it start? Two?
I think you‚Äôre just waiting on Rebecca
Bill: Already talked about doing the planning so early and issues with it.
Bill: The poll at the end of January.
Nokri (Marisa): <:woah:543194447345876998>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I don‚Äôt think laser tag is everyone‚Äôs crowd
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That‚Äôs why stuff like chestnut hill still went off really successfully
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not to mention we have more lurkers than ever in BNE
Bill: Is whatever. I don‚Äôt care to BNE size for awhile.
Bill: This is pretty legit even if we SUCK
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the lady that sent me a paper to study warned me that it was a long read
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the seconds are cumulatively only 18 pages
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): a lot of which are pictures
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): physics majors must really have no patience for reading damn
Bill: That got pretty awesome as we spread to the other fields. If I could get a group of thirty I‚Äôd do this again.
Bill: More legit feeling that laser one.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The nice little British lady that works here just looked at my physics paper and audibly went ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Nokri (Marisa): Why? :0 because it says hadrons should be discussed using their components rather than the whole and then goes on to not do that?
Nokri (Marisa): are British physics spelled differently omg
Nokri (Marisa): Was Mother‚Äôs Day really just last week? Feels like I‚Äôve been inside much longer
