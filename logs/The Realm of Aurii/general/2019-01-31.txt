Bill: Being stuck has inspired me to look at smaller SUVs again.
Bill: Rogue like, but not the rogue.
Bill: Anyone got a thought on what to look at? I'm going to look at Jeep and Subaru offerings, but not sure what beyond that.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Toyota? Honda?
Bill: I looked at the Toyota entry once, wasn't a big fan. Know anyone who has one?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My brother has 2 Tom's boss has 2 my best friend had one
Bill: Cars or SUVs?
Bill: I just assume, most of the people I know have cars.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My brother has a Tacoma (truck)and whatever their SUV is he loves them bith
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): My best friend and Tom's boss have)had cars
N🆗ri (Marisa): i read that as your brother has two toms
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~it's either Jen or Gabi I've met both~~
Bill: Or Aliza I guess.
Bill: How's she fairing being back?
Bill: Thinking about looking at:
Subaru Forester/Crosstrek (maybe)
Ford Escape/Edge (Maybe)
Nissan Rogue (I guess I have to)
Jeep Cherokee
N🆗ri (Marisa): those are good anime character names
Bill: I mean, Nanoha.
Bill: Every character was named after a car
Bill: I'm not at all motivated for this tho like...
Bill: Great opportunity.
Bill: but investing the time in doing this is just oof.
Bill: My trains on a 25 minute delay.

Dirty Lego (Tom): Yeah probably 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~and then ill still be tempted to buy it cuz it NEAT~~
Bill: ~~and Tom won't complain cause you'll smell like Waifu~~
Bill: *though technically CC perfume should smell like a pizza hut*
Dirty Lego (Tom): Then id want pizza all the time
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~I already smell like waifu, i am literally married to him~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you already want pizza all the time
N🆗ri (Marisa): Perfumes are illegal to mail out of japan so it might be hard to find at a con
N🆗ri (Marisa): Every time I mailed something they were like *is this perfume*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Or fireworks
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): RIP the dream
N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw no euphemia perfume
N🆗ri (Marisa): we just gotta go to japan
N🆗ri (Marisa): Really suffering that Katsu crouch now. This thread and bias tape is the worst ever.
N🆗ri (Marisa): If I sew too fast the thread disintegrates lol
Bill: how is that?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m pretty sure the thread also phased through the needle somehow at one point
Bill: how... does that work tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Super low quality thread <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m only using it on the top stitch because no way can it hold up on both sides
Bill: where do you get thread?
N🆗ri (Marisa): China <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just this gold thread
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): how mych is your thread?
N🆗ri (Marisa): It was like $1 for a spool
Bill: Oh, can you get a similar thread at Joanns or something?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I mean a cone
N🆗ri (Marisa): Idk I didn’t check but if so it’d be super expensive
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OHHH like the big boi?
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee
N🆗ri (Marisa): I gotta hold it because I don’t have a holder for it lol
Bill: How much can thread really cost tho?
N🆗ri (Marisa): A lot
N🆗ri (Marisa): Lemme see if their site has it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think the big ones are like $3-4
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): is it embrodery thread or just normal'
N🆗ri (Marisa): Normal thread
N🆗ri (Marisa): $13 for a small cone it looks like
N🆗ri (Marisa): Half cone thing whatever that is
Bill: I didn't get you a christmas present yet... <.< >.>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Kotoricon
N🆗ri (Marisa): Don’t u even try pink
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): dang, you need all that?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye I’m satin stitching a lot
N🆗ri (Marisa): Im not gonna satin stitch ray I will die
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): https://www.threadart.com/product/1612/all-purpose-polyester-sewing-thread-no-121-600m-lt-gold
Bill: Kotoricon was cause I wanted to go to Kotoricon with you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oo that’s a reasonable price 
Merr chrimmas!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Almost cut my finger off lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): MARISA BE THE CARE'FUL
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s fun. We’re having fun. Its lots of fun.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): not if you hurt yourself
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): what are you working on now?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m trying to power through Katarina <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hows it goin?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Cursed™
Bill: Oops.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ray is super easy he’s goin great but Katarina. Why.
N🆗ri (Marisa): khhhhhhh
N🆗ri (Marisa): I kiiiiind of have the hang of it now? A speed that won’t disintegrate the thread and won’t cause it to tangle, and extra fabric so the fabric stops buckling in crucial spots
N🆗ri (Marisa): The bobbin is gonna run out any minute now I c an feel it in my soul
Bill: Or you can get better thread!
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can get more fabric because Jack’s but I can’t spend money on anything else for a bit (but I’ll be getting money soon!) and it’s a bit late to wait for shipping
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m getting some chiffon today in the hopes it makes my skirt lay nicer
Bill: I said *OOPS*
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m gonna murder u
Bill: ~~oh good I was waiting to find out you gave me a bad email address in december`~
N🆗ri (Marisa): What is that
I’m gonna decline it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I feel bad I never sent you mail while you were in Japan too, so I'm making up for that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): How do I decline a thing
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): did u paypal her?
Bill: ~~no~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ll send it back for the Katsu room
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): you did
N🆗ri (Marisa): He’s paid me to put a hit on him because he wants to test my killing ability
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): congratulations on your first outgoing paypal payment btw
Bill: I WAS going to get you a Joanna's gift card for christmas, but I never got to an actual Joann's and if I did it now and mailed it it wouldn't be useful for Katsu crunch.
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is backwards the model has to pay the photographer
Bill: So pretend it's a gift card.
Bill: It's not the fiiiirst but ye lol
Bill: ~~who the fuck would pay for what I do tho~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): as soon as I get to a computer ur gettin a full refund
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hewwo
Bill: I'd feel wrong taking money from friends. Though I do wonder what I'd really be worth.
Bill: ~~6 photos, half hour, 150 dollars~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): U gotta save or when u retire you’ll be broke 
*i feel bad taking money from 友達*
Bill: ~~*I never do a photoshoot again*~~
Bill: You can return it, but I'm still going to get you that gift card I should have got before Kotori.
N🆗ri (Marisa): How about
Instead of gift card
A free photoshoot at a con
Bill: ~~All my photoshoots are free~~
Bill: The last time I got compensated for a shoot was... Katsu last year, Tom and Jess bought dinner Sunday night.
Bill: DIRECTLY compensated was Otakon 2017 when you *stuck a dollar bill in my bag like a photo stripper*.
Bill: ~~but I'm desperate to do photos and assume people wouldn't want to pay money to shoot with me so I'll never charge randos either~~
Bill: There's also the whole "meeting people" thing but *that* backfired so.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Temple’s financial aid is the absolute worst thing on earth so we’re broke right now but I’m in communications with them and they’re giving me financial aid for this semester soon. It’s a wreck. But until then we’re eating canned vegetables and boxed stuffing every day <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 

After Katsu imma work on itabags and kigu and try selling those
Bill: Kigu would be popular!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye I’m just afraid of charging people a lot for them
Bill: hmm. I dunno how to price things (obviously) but I'll think about it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I give y’all giant discounts
A lot of mass produced kigu go for like $50 online and I think that’s insane but that’d be the minimum I could sell custom ones for
N🆗ri (Marisa): Totoro kigu on the House
N🆗ri (Marisa): They asked to share this ad
Bill: You want to be sure to make a good profit.
Bill: Like 10% of cost?
Bill: *I've played Reccetear I know how to sell things*
N🆗ri (Marisa): $2 profit 👍
N🆗ri (Marisa): The next Zenkaikon meeting is super bowl Sunday what’re they thinking
N🆗ri (Marisa): Also what are the chances that sweet victory will be played
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Omg plz
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wat a bop as the kids say
N🆗ri (Marisa): There was a petition but I think people forgot about it
What a slammin jam
N🆗ri (Marisa): Gettin the hang of it now
I need a hand needle for the corners though lol rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: Not RIP.
Bill: anything but rip
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had one yesterday it might still be upstairs but it could also be in the fridge for all I know
I’ll check the fridge
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not in the fridge
N🆗ri (Marisa): What a word. *fridge.* short for refrigerator. Spectacular. Where does the d come from.
Bill: britain, probably.
N🆗ri (Marisa): So much for American innovation
N🆗ri (Marisa): The bobbin ran out. It lasted a lot longer than I thought it would wow. So brave.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): He fought so hard
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a sign I should take a break
Today’s progress has been exceedingly slow
Partially because I keep ripping everything out and redoing it. That might be a minor reason.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I gotta fix the bottom somehow hhhhhh
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Pretty!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Maybe if I take it to a church that’ll help
N🆗ri (Marisa): Rid the curses
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): No curse
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ghost possession
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Take break have snak
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ain’t got no snaks
Gotta embroider <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Don't you have like a life supply of kitkats?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooooo yeah!!!
They’re either gifts or alcoholic though
I forgot about them lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mawisa
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Has you eaten today?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Naw
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can eat maybe in... 3 hours 👍
N🆗ri (Marisa): Whenever BoJo gets home
We’re tight on money this week so we only have canned veggies and some boxed stuffing from the food bank
They had milk too but their milk is usually expired or tastes funny
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭 nuuuu do you like veggies or stuffing?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t like stuffing but I like carrots and corn!! 🥕 🌽 <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~ship yourself ulp here so I can feed you~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): We’ll get food next week~!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): NO DAS NOT OK 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): And Sylvia has food we prioritized that of course
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Did you eat yesterday?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye I had some peas and stuffing yesterday 👍
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I'm worried about you 😭
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Don't die plz
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s ok I washed off most of the super glue from my hands so I can touch stuff again and the fumes have mostly dissipated <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Never fear all might is on TV
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess did you eat yesterday
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea 😥
N🆗ri (Marisa): Good!!! Good good

N🆗ri (Marisa): I drank some water when I woke up I’m fine
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Did you get paid from your work at the HOA yet?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!! That went towards the graduation fee since it was due today :3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): $220 grad fee and they gave me $200 to do all the invoices
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): That's so expensive 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): I know I was shocked they paid me that much
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Nooooo da graduation fee!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye temple sucks
N🆗ri (Marisa): The teachers are nice but their system is a mess
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): When do you graduate?
N🆗ri (Marisa): May! If everything goes well!
N🆗ri (Marisa): My gameboy only lets you embroider 20 lines at a time and I can’t form a cross with that. Noooooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did you ever get home from work
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> for graduating
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yes I am home now
N🆗ri (Marisa): WOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): you made it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I made it!
N🆗ri (Marisa): You gotta say ただいま like an anime character when you walk in
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): But no ones here
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not even you?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Spooky
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 👻
N🆗ri (Marisa): WAIT I DID EAT TODAY

That’s like 90% of a necessary diet right. I’m great
N🆗ri (Marisa): At least the ghosts aren’t there
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THAT NOT FOOD
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah it is it’s like a fruit snack
N🆗ri (Marisa): I bet they come in ghost shapes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mine are fruit shaped
N🆗ri (Marisa): Samesies!!!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Woah how cool is that
N🆗ri (Marisa): If you melt them down can you reform them into other shapes
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Probably!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Tom go home jess is waiting for you
Dirty Lego (Tom): I just got home!
Dirty Lego (Tom): YOU NEED FOOD
Dirty Lego (Tom): We're going down there to feed you
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'm taking off work for a week
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess tom is home!! Now someone is there right
Dirty Lego (Tom): Gotta go feed Marisa
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nooo I ate I had that vitamin
Dirty Lego (Tom): I can cook many things
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 🛒
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Lesgoooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): Andru works at the local shop rite it’s a terrifying place
N🆗ri (Marisa): Let’s go visit
N🆗ri (Marisa): What is goin on with my thread
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wow that was all out of whack
N🆗ri (Marisa): *why is the thread white when I’m using gold thread*
N🆗ri (Marisa): ??????????
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh no!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Did the coating come off?
N🆗ri (Marisa): No it’s still totally gold on the needle
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is like some reverse philosopher’s stone mumbo jumbo
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg I just realized I can watch Crunchyroll without a subscription on my Xbox AND there’s an amazon prime video app this is like Christmas
I’ve seen all the anime on Netflix and Hulu but this opens so many new possibilities. I never realized how many anime amazon has even if most of them are moe trash
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is wonderful
N🆗ri (Marisa): All this access to anime. I can breath again. It’s like when your nose is clogged for a month and suddenly it’s free. That’s my mood.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m overwhelmed idk which show to start with im so behind hhhhh
Is zombieland saga really a cooking show like the manga suggest because from what I’ve seen of the anime they are nowhere near similar and the manga adaptation is just trolling fans
N🆗ri (Marisa): Wait I know what I’m gonna watch first
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): They better call nobunaga nobunyaga or I’m filing a formal complaint
N🆗ri (Marisa): They didn’t 
They didn’t make the pun this show SUCKS
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): How u watch for free?
N🆗ri (Marisa): It has ads and I have to wait a week after release to view any new episodes
You can watch it free online I just didn’t know you can also do it on consoles
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s also not HD
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow goblin slayer looks really good animated. They keep playing ads for goblin slayer and how not to summon a demon king
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oooo ye we used to use that
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The free version
N🆗ri (Marisa): I used to have the paid version but I don’t mind the ads
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): We switched to Funimation
N🆗ri (Marisa): If you have a paid subscription crunchy gives you free stuff at cons
Bill: Yeah Tom got that at ANYC.
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
Oooo that’s right there was a thing with funi and crunchy recently
N🆗ri (Marisa): B I G B A G
