Afina (Georgia🍀): Update to the snow-Mist thing
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nathaniel talked to mangoloo, who had no idea that her posse was on alert
Afina (Georgia🍀): So Nathaniel was like "yeah there's a lot of pressure from people not to stay neutral, and georgia and I are really stressed by itL
Aldus (Jess): 🙄
Afina (Georgia🍀): And she was like "oh no I love georgia! I'll try to help you guys"
Bill: Bless, she's off my shit list.
Afina (Georgia🍀): SO the drama from that should be receding
Afina (Georgia🍀): Though angryjigglypuff isn't acting as part of the Casey crew
Afina (Georgia🍀): As far as Nathaniel can tell she's just an aggressive person
Aldus (Jess): Yea she def is
Bill: she seems it. She's a bully, just as much as mist/snow.
Bill: Casey can easily whip Jake into shape, I'm sure.
Aldus (Jess): Mangaloo seems very no confrontational
Eliran (Halim): Mangaloo is v focus on her persona
Eliran (Halim): Being confrontational and all like that is the exact opposite
Afina (Georgia🍀): So angryjigglypuff acts alone essentially, and she's the extreme version of trying to help Mist
Bill: she's stepped up before. I think she has it in her, she just doesn't do so outside trusted people. Helps keep the 'irl ruby' persona, helps her stay private and detached from the shit.
Afina (Georgia🍀): (By getting snow banned from things)
Afina (Georgia🍀): And yeah
Bill: Casey can reign in her posse.
Eliran (Halim): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): I genuinely believe Casey is going to help
Afina (Georgia🍀): So things should get better from here
Bill: Still keeps your eyes and ears open though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I just have to learn to ignore what angryjigglypuff says really is it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll refrain from posting Team RWBY pics too
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm still wary now just not on high alert anymore
Afina (Georgia🍀): The only reason Casey is involved too is cause Mist got doxxed at colossalcon east when Casey was RIGHT THERE
Afina (Georgia🍀): Otherwise she doesn't know anything about the situation
Bill: which fits my image of Casey.
Bill: The real one.
Bill: I'd love to meet the real one, not that it's real possible.
Bill: But good. Nathaniel is doing some major fucking work.
Bill: Stay vigilant, and lets focus on fun for the weekend. 😃
Afina (Georgia🍀): WOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nathaniel is getting the biggest hug at RTX
Afina (Georgia🍀): what a bro
Bill: According to Meg he has a thing for her, so putting in a good word for him might be a good thank you. Iiiiiif you want to play shipper.
Bill: But that's better done tactifully later, like closer to Katsu.
Bill: ~~also Meg doesn't like him like that at all so there's that~~
Bill: oh <@!351471675843411978>  you want me to bring red flags?
Nokri (Marisa): Biru raising the red flags up in here
Nokri (Marisa): Is there more drama happening OwO
Nokri (Marisa): Prayer circle that none of my clients show up for the rest of the day so I can sit around doing nothing for 8 more hours
Eliran (Halim): I knew it 
I was wondering if he was pining for her
Afina (Georgia🍀): He paid for her to go to RTX of COURSE he is
Bill: He's her partner in the darling group too apparently?
Bill: <@!141729881779077121> do you want to follow up with Meg on that?
Eliran (Halim): Yes he is
Eliran (Halim): Shes 02, hes Hiro
Eliran (Halim): Also were open to adding other people for darling cosplays, so if <@141729881779077121> wants to joinnnnn
Bill: I introduced him to Meg at Next since he expressed an interest before.
Andrew: so its goro and futoshi?
Aldus (Jess): Yes plz
Bill: Goro taken, pretty sure it's Erik.
Eliran (Halim): For our group... 
we got the full squad 13 last I checked 
But like 
Somebody joined us is gonna be a 9
Eliran (Halim): Yeah Erik is goro
Eliran (Halim): ~~he beat me to it~~
Bill: I'm still out on the porch man. If everyone wasn't getting ready to do stuff tomorrow, I'd have tried impromptu fire pit.
Nokri (Marisa): Pyromania
Nokri (Marisa): Biru the meg you mentioned
Is that meg or is it a different meg
Aldus (Jess): Yeeee I'm already at my parents getting ready
Bill: I know 😛
Bill: Different Meg.
Nokri (Marisa): So many megs
Bill: Only two.
Nokri (Marisa): Jess whatcha getting ready for
Nokri (Marisa): That’s like. Twenty times as many as there should be
Bill: Did Jess not give you an obligatory invite to her birthday party?
Nokri (Marisa): 😱
Nokri (Marisa): betrayal
Nokri (Marisa): I forgot birthday parties exist
Nokri (Marisa): I hope it’s a cosplay party
Bill: it is not.
Bill: ~~and now I'm wondering if you'd try to show in cosplay anyway~~
Nokri (Marisa): Not? A cosplay party??? Jess u ok
Nokri (Marisa): ヽ༼ ຈل͜ຈ༽ ﾉ
Afina (Georgia🍀): >->
Afina (Georgia🍀): *slowly removes Pyrrha from bag*
Aldus (Jess): I considered inviting you as well as my friend in NC and other Japan fren but I knew you wouldn't be able to come 😭
Aldus (Jess): Tom did ask me what cosplays we were bringing on the way out
Bill: lol
Bill: oops I still haven't unpacked my duffel.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Riparoni🙏
Bill: I'll do it tonight or tomorrow morning, it's fine.
Aldus (Jess): I got party hats
Bill: Did you get party hats to put on the party hats.
Aldus (Jess): No 😭
Aldus (Jess): I have failed
Bill: as long as there's bourbon it's fine.
Aldus (Jess): Well you'll have to bring that
Aldus (Jess): 😅
Bill: should have brought the bottle I left at your house. =/
Aldus (Jess): I'm sorry! I didn't thank about it I had so much stuff I had to bring
Aldus (Jess): Let me check basement
Bill: Don’t you start. It’s your birthday.
Bill: Maybe I should bring whatever I needed for that lemon drink I made for Georgia. That shit was good and summery.
Aldus (Jess): There is about 1 shot of JD (which is from AnimeNEXT 2016) and some ancient scotch whiskey
Aldus (Jess): I thought of bringing my supply of hard liquor but I totally forgot
Bill: Ancient in scotch can have a unique meaning there.
Aldus (Jess): 
Aldus (Jess): Das a blurry ass pic opps
Aldus (Jess): Oh I didn't even see the Leeds
Aldus (Jess): They are both of unknown age
Bill: 
Bill: It’s pretty accurate, so apparently get less sleep than I thought.
Eliran (Halim): fuck me UP 
Spain v Portugal was such a gooooood game
Eliran (Halim): but fuck spain lost points in such a dumb way
Eliran (Halim): they should have won
Nokri (Marisa): JESS WHAT IS *THAT*
Nokri (Marisa): ***jessiwhoozica***
Bill: Me: I have a crick in my neck from laying in bed
Also me: stays in bed another hour
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): What a thrilling answer
