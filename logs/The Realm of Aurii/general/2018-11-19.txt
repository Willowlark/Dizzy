Bill: Oof I think my second green tea of the day is no sweetener, not double.
Bill: Bleh.
Bill: Damnit Starbucks.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): your office doesnt have a coffee station? you could just go put some sweetner in if they do
Bill: Iced. Need the liquid stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i guess, i used to use powder, sweet and low seems to work fine in iced
Bill: It’s literally next door, I just swung back down.
Bill: They really should lower the music; they have a lot of issues hearing orders in my experience.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah you don't need the liquid stuff,sweet and low works fine
Bill: Hmm. So I’ve gotten iced green tea at Dunkin’ and they’d put regular sugar. I alway ended up drinking crystals though, so I thought the heat helped the sugar dissolve.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): sugar yea, sweet n low, slplenda, truvia, or equal arnt sugar
Bill: I usually get Splenda.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): hmm weird i usually use sweet and low when i did it though, im not sure. now i drink everything unsweetened  or i use truvia/stevia if i do
Bill: I like truvia best, but I never assume a place has it.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i know starbucks has it but it might not be truvia brand so it would be just stevia
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its the same shit though
Bill: Liberty science center is doing a Sherlock Holmes exhibit.
