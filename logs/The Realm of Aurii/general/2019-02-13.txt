N🆗ri (Marisa): YE BOU
N🆗ri (Marisa): I
N🆗ri (Marisa): BOIIU
Andrew: for RF 4 the big point in the trailer was marriage system
N🆗ri (Marisa): Look at the rune factory server lol it changed to a five
N🆗ri (Marisa): All rune factory had a marriage system pssh I liked that aspect better in RF3, the one in four is a bit flawed
Andrew: why so?>
Andrew: am curious
N🆗ri (Marisa): Marriage proposal event is entirely random. It could take years in-game to trigger. I only married Leon because no one else proposed after like 2 years of dating every single guy in town
N🆗ri (Marisa): At the same time
Andrew: lool
Andrew: but yea that seems a bit odd
N🆗ri (Marisa): In three it was all about events like in harvest moon so you just finish all the requests of your chosen spouse and Tada. Easy
