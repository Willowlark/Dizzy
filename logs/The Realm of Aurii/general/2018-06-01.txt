Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Oh yeah Jared was in NYC lmao
Bill: This is hilarious.
Bill: I love not a musical, it‚Äôs straight up comedy.
Bill: Y‚Äôall get tickets I‚Äôll come again and see it with you. Do the whole city guide thing.
Bill: The play that goes wrong.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): I'd so go. I haven't seen a show in ages
Bill: You fucks have to go. There‚Äôs was a non ironic dab, and that stupid meme dance.
Atalantia Enneka (Allison): Omg that sounds amazing
Nokri (Marisa): what's the play
Nokri (Marisa): i saw Shear Madness once on a field trip and i guess that particular showing was only for schools on field trips because at one point the whole cast is arguing and they start talking about their academic background, and they're like "i graduated from blah blah high school!" and "well *i* graduated from blah blah school!" and each section of the audience started cheering
but we were a synagogue so the actor with ours was like "i flunked out of temple emmanuel hebrew school"
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Ok so I re-found this photo
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): 
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): And at first glance I thought Tom had a really tiny leg that he was sticking out and Bill was just grabbing it
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): _but now I see that is Bills foot_
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: YES I THOUGHT SO TOO
Aldus (Jess): Lmao

Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): I LOVE THE BANANAS FUCK
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): he has to know what time it is
Bill: What had you looking through old pictures anyway?
Nokri (Marisa): search for blackmail material
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: How's everyone's mornings (and Marisa's night of course)
Nokri (Marisa): if you take a cough drop and dissolve it in hot water and then stick it in the fridge and then drink it does it still have the same effect as just putting the cough drop in your mouth
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: ...
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Probably works better
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: More even dispersion but at the same time not as concentrated so it also may do nothing
Nokri (Marisa): so what if you put like a whole bag of cough drops into a swimming pool
miracle pool
Aldus (Jess): Heals everything
Nokri (Marisa): guys i know how nokri can get rich quick now
Aldus (Jess): üòÆ

Bill: *What's your password, I'll do it myself*
Aldus (Jess): get outa here
Bill: There's no notification to unfriending. You don't post often. They literally won't notice unless they look at your account.
Aldus (Jess): lol i know
Bill: Only reason I knew Angelica unfriended me is because I was about to unfriend her.
Nokri (Marisa): ooooooooooooo beaten to the punch
what's the gossip between you and angelica
Bill: Very old and irrelevant.
Aldus (Jess): i just imaged marisa leaning forward on her desk with her chin in her hands like "ok spill"
Nokri (Marisa): it's tru that's what i did

Nokri (Marisa): i can't believe biru and angelica were childhood friends until one day one betrayed the other and caused a rift in the fabric of space and time. wow.

Aldus (Jess): ye those are nice
Aldus (Jess): i like the cardigans
Bill: They probably run asian sizes, so I'm not even looking.
Aldus (Jess): HA $116 and i though bethesda/bioware's were expensive at 50
Aldus (Jess): guys lets all drive to ohio right now for colossalcon
Nokri (Marisa): check the weather forecast first, i've heard some big horror stories from colossal
the funnest and most scariest con
Aldus (Jess): wait why? cuz if like rain or?
Nokri (Marisa): the location is on the outskirts of tornado alley and colossalcon is during peak tornado season, some incidents in the past. worst one was in 2010 or 2011 I think when the resort was evacuated and everyone had to go into the basement at like 3am
Bill: And how far of a trip is that?
Aldus (Jess): oooo that sucks
Aldus (Jess): idk im just kidding
Nokri (Marisa): the weather was throwing off the resort's alarm system and there was a disconnect between con staff and resort staff, so one group was giving one set of directions and another group was issuing other contradictory commands.

then they needed volunteers to knock on rooms and ask people to go to the basement and instead of being calm, attendees started screaming and banging on room doors shouting there was a tornado and they needed to evacuate

one girl got really sick in the basement. it was small and cramped and things were not handled well
Nokri (Marisa): here's a video!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBy_8vDa61o#lq-lq2
Nokri (Marisa): also this was sunday morning so no one got sleep and were exhausted for the drive back on sunday
Nokri (Marisa): but aside from all that colossalcon is paradise
Aldus (Jess): tornadocon omg
Bill: awww, I'm almost out of allegra again.
Nokri (Marisa): ye i think between katsucon's freezing fire alarm, otakon's 1000 degree fire alarm, and anime expo's bomb threat, tornadocon would take the cake
Aldus (Jess): 7.5 hr drive
Aldus (Jess): ye ok ill stick with east
Nokri (Marisa): we gotta have a get together in wildwood sometime. beach cosplay party.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Oof tornado connnnn
Bill: yeee definitely.
Aldus (Jess): LETS GOOOO
Bill: Only like, 700 dollars to get a flight there.
Nokri (Marisa): when I return i'll find a time we can use my family's houses
Aldus (Jess): like a timeshare?
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Woo family estate episode üôå
Nokri (Marisa): naw they own the houses, there's just usually always someone down there in the summer chilling around
Nokri (Marisa): a weekend when literally 20 people aren't there
Aldus (Jess): üòÑ
Aldus (Jess): houses? as in plural?
Nokri (Marisa): ye
Nokri (Marisa): they're a little shabby since maintenance is ongoing but they've got all the amenities. or maintenance may have finished it's been a little while since I went down and stayed overnight
Aldus (Jess): oh thats ok they could have outhouses and id still be like wow. good. shit.
Nokri (Marisa): relatives own the empty lot with the car on it (was gonna build another house but we use it for parking instead), the blue house, and the white one next to it but that's got trees blocking it on google street view.
Nokri (Marisa): naw yo we've got running water. I've always stayed in the blue house and that has 3 showers (2 inside 1 outside).
There was one summer we had to use next door's bathroom while they repaired something, but we could go around the back and there's an outdoor bathroom that they put walls and a roof over so it was kind of like an outhouse oops
Nokri (Marisa): but an outhouse turned into an actual bathroom, connected to plumbing and all
Aldus (Jess): NEATO
Aldus (Jess): which wildwood?
Nokri (Marisa): a-are there multiple wildwoods :0
Aldus (Jess): yea theres like wildwood crest and wold wood north and stuff

Aldus (Jess): i like doggo
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Boofer boisss
Aldus (Jess): ye dats the main wildwood
Nokri (Marisa): Half of them are blind so if/when this comes to fruition and if there are dogs there they might bump into ya but they‚Äôre very sweet if they realize they‚Äôve walked into you they‚Äôll just flop onto your legs and demand pets
Aldus (Jess): OMG

Aldus (Jess): what type of puppers?
Dave: My pupper is blind üï∂
Nokri (Marisa): Lots OwO
Artemis and Shiloh are twins (boy and girl) but Artemis is black and Shiloh is white. They‚Äôre some kind of sheep dog
Arabella is some kind of hound I think? Thor is a pit bull but he‚Äôs literally a marshmallow he cries when it rains
Madeline is a lab I think
Sneezy is small I don‚Äôt know what she is but she‚Äôs tiny and basically a mop. Like a chihuahua with the fur of a poodle. 
And then there‚Äôs a huge orange guy whose name I can‚Äôt remember, he doesn‚Äôt come down much because he has a little temper
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): There‚Äôs Artemis and Arabella. They like swimming. Behind them is Harley
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: He didn't a smile
Aldus (Jess): AHHHH ‚ù§
Aldus (Jess): oh tom allergic though
Nokri (Marisa): OH NO
Nokri (Marisa): we can quarantine tom
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Can always take allergy meds if it in for a few days
Nokri (Marisa): I can aim for a weekend when no dogs are there, or when the dogs will only be in the other house
Nokri (Marisa): But there might be fur everywhere
Nokri (Marisa): We vacuum
Dave: One must make sacrifices for the borkers, if it's at the cost of Tom's life, that's fine with me
Aldus (Jess): we bring tent
Nokri (Marisa): We have entire empty lot, lots of tent space
Aldus (Jess): or just inject tom with pure zyrtec
Nokri (Marisa): ‚ÄúDo it for the cosplay‚Äù
Nokri (Marisa): Tom if you pass out do it in character and make sure bill gets a picture of it

Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: What's witty
Bill: the email monkier I just explained.
Aldus (Jess): wait what do you mean you never realized clark and snark rymed, yes you did
Bill: Nope. Not until now.
Aldus (Jess): you had a whole thing about "slark's snark"
Bill: I mean, I still do. It just didn't register as a rhyme.
Bill: I should probably be using that.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: You explained it but I don't understand
Bill: my email is willowlark. Willow = **Will**iam.
Bill: Lark = C**lark**.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Ok but how is it witty, you just changed your name
Bill: *it's made... of parts of my name...*
Bill: forget it.
Bill: <@!279360609416642561> This warning should have come a while ago, but the bobbies-physics channel is actually for NSFW stuff. Not like, 'oh my god, why are you even talking about it' but for links and images you *really* don't want your coworkers seeing over your shoulder.
Bill: *The channel also changes names on occasion*
