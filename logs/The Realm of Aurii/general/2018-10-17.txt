Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): The sin shelf
Afina (Georgia): How many people get freakin admit status in BNE?
Afina (Georgia): Cause if I see more channels being created eventually it‚Äôs gonna be too many to keep track of
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oh wow meg has it too. that's gotta be at least half the server?
Afina (Georgia): _of course Hal gave Meg admit status_ üôÑ
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oh the server is bigger thani thought. maybe like. 1/4 the server
Bill: Down girl.
Bill: Meg doesn't have admin.
Bill: Hal created the channel.
Afina (Georgia): And didn‚Äôt put it to a vote
Afina (Georgia): Of course
Afina (Georgia): _even better_
Afina (Georgia): _thoughtless boy_
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): time for admins wars. overthrow the patriarchy.
Afina (Georgia): I don‚Äôt wanna shit on anyone‚Äôs parade but I almost wanna send something like ‚Äúcan we vote to install new channels please and thank‚Äù
Bill: ~~you never should have gave him BNE back~~
Afina (Georgia): Otherwise ~~Hal~~ people are gonna pointless channels
Bill: Rei has the ability to do it too.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): hasn't he been doing a lot of shoots with hunter recently
~~is the channel just a way for him to get his pictures faster~~
Bill: BNE admins are Hal, Georgia, Dizzy, myself and Reiley has partial powers,.
Afina (Georgia): Hal doesn‚Äôt have any content because he didnt want to make it unless I twisted his arm
Afina (Georgia): Now that I‚Äôm gone he‚Äôs content-less and realizes he wants it
Afina (Georgia): Not that he‚Äôs been very good at generating his own ü§î
Bill: But Hunter is a slut for photoshoots.
Bill: so.
Bill: Only problem with saying 'this should go to a vote' is it'll pass.
Bill: Democracy is dumb.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): that's a mood, comrade.
Afina (Georgia): I mean yes
Bill: BNE needs a fucking charter.
Afina (Georgia): But it‚Äôs the principle that matters
Afina (Georgia): We respect everyone so we put it to a vote whether to add channels
Afina (Georgia): I don‚Äôt really care that we added that specific channel
Afina (Georgia): But I care that he didn‚Äôt think to ask anyone‚Äôs opinion first
Afina (Georgia): Who gonna be the call out person
Bill: I can't do diplomatic mode right now.
Afina (Georgia): hey marisa everyone likes you and believes you can do no wrong, you wanna do it? :V
Bill: Please do not throw sweet utterly oblivous Marisa into a potential shitshow.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i was considering it, i gotta work up my nerve i can try üí™
Afina (Georgia): ok if _I_ say something will yall make some kind of comment agreeing with me?
Afina (Georgia): my only fear is seeming like a single person having a tantrum
Bill: I don't want anyone reading into it being break up related.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i will 100% back u up ye
Bill: Which is what I think people will take it as. *Georgia hates Hal doing things cause she's mad at him*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): yeah i'm trying to think if there's a way to word it without overly blaming it on the photo channel
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): which is why it'd be good for me or you to voice an opinon
Afina (Georgia): ah yeah maybe i shouldnt say it then
Bill: BNE needs some standards and rules. But I'm not sitting on a list of them.
Afina (Georgia): well for now we can just tackle this ONE
Afina (Georgia): "hey guys its been kinda common courtesy to throw a poll up before making a channel, can we make that an actual rule?"
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i can post like
"bne is getting a lot of channels and it's getting a bit hard to navigate. while i do love the photo channel, is it ok to put any new stuff to a vote before it's official?"
does that sound mean
Afina (Georgia): "not that i dont love the photograph channel but it would just be nice to be in accordance and itll keep the channel list from getting too long"
Afina (Georgia): NAH THATS PERF MARISA
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): here i go. nyoom.
Afina (Georgia): i support u bby
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): should i put in general or announcements
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): leaning towards announcements
Bill: general.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oki
Bill: Announcements will read as you want to *make* an announcement, which goes against the 'this is confusing, can we talk about it?' mood.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): it helps that there aren't a lot of people on right now üåü  w üåü
Bill: Ye, I'm out.
Bill: All I want to do is take fucking Hunter to task.
Bill: If he wants to do stupid things, do it on his own server.
Afina (Georgia): Marisa and Georgia combo attack activated!!
Afina (Georgia): _i think its super effective_
Bill: The only person who fucking matters is Hal.
Bill: He's the only one who has to also respect the rule.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): did not expect hunter to take this very personally
Afina (Georgia): yeah me neither.....
Afina (Georgia): hes an oddball sometimes
Afina (Georgia): good natured, but very touchy about random things i guess
Aldus (Jess): I'm sorry guys, but I'm not touching any if this with a 10 ft pole
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oh thank goodness erik and rebecca and coming in
understandable jess 100%
Aldus (Jess): ~~avoiding confrontation is a sacred past time~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): while u watch this drama unfold u can vote the survey thing if u want but take ur time no pressure
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): in the quest channel
Aldus (Jess): Nyoom
Afina (Georgia): i see a wild subject change
Bill: Put a fucking vote in to announcements.
Bill: Hunter is distracting the conversation.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): "i don't any of you" but "hey lets do photoshoots" ü§î
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oh they only know 12 people. still isn't that like everyone active in the server
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i'm just a little agitated that they took it so harshly asdjjhgtfasfdg thank goodness youtube is back
Afina (Georgia): should i throw up the vote or
Bill: yes.
Afina (Georgia): should someone not hals ex
Afina (Georgia): lmao kk
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i think it's ok now that the subject has been breached?
Bill: Hal clearly, as usual, doesn't care about anything,
Afina (Georgia): kk
Bill: 
Bill: well fuck.
Afina (Georgia): its obvious
Afina (Georgia): sorry bill üò¨
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): peach parade is a go
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oof
Bill: I already said I can't do diplomacy right now.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): who's the person with the curse in their name? is that the person called aubrey. is that the small.
Afina (Georgia): thats reiley
Bill: It's Rei.
Afina (Georgia): idk why they voted that way
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ooo
Afina (Georgia): probably cause theyre an admit and want _maximum powerrrr_
Bill: Rei subscribes to chaos.
Afina (Georgia): tru....
Bill: ~~also friends why don't you point out that I'm not being diplomatic to me, why is Erik doing it~~
Aldus (Jess): Rei mentioned before that they are in many servers where there are 100+ channels. They're used to alot of channels
Aldus (Jess): You said you couldn't be diplomatic, therefore I thought you knew
Bill: I said I shouldn't be involved because of that, and look what I did anyway.
Bill: Oh good, he messaged me cause he doesn't like the photo dumps.
Bill: He's in agreement.
Bill: ~~The rare Erik gossiping~~
Afina (Georgia): owo
Afina (Georgia): well its annoying if you arent in the photos lol
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i wonder how hunter organizes their photos if they don't have a gallery anywhere. do they just mail a zipped folder.
ye i feel like the photo channel is gonna become photos of hal channel
Aldus (Jess): oooof really don't line this
Bill: BNE is a fucking mess right now.
Aldus (Jess): It's dividing the whole channel
Afina (Georgia): ~~look whos voting one way hm~~
Aldus (Jess): Yea exactly, it's driving a harder rift in things than they're allready was üò≠
Afina (Georgia): well reiley isnt active
Afina (Georgia): hunters opinion was known
Afina (Georgia): hal and meg... my opinion is known on
Bill: ~~Don't worry Marisa, Aurii will never go away because BNE is going to implode eventually~~
Afina (Georgia): frankly they can make a kiribaku discord where they circlejerk to kiribaku all day üòë
Aldus (Jess): Tru
Bill: The four horseman of Discourse.
Afina (Georgia): 9 to 4, DEMOCRACY WINNING BITCHES
Afina (Georgia): omg
Afina (Georgia): honestly i think megs voting cause hals voting that way
Afina (Georgia): ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Afina (Georgia): she used to never even use BNE frankly
Afina (Georgia): til like... recently
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i'm laughing imagining everyone scurrying to their respective closer-knit discord groups and bashing on everyone else
Afina (Georgia): everyones _probably_ bashing each other right now
Afina (Georgia): tho i appreciate hunters help with the dremmel bits
Bill: BNE has always had cliques, and the ruling clique (~~mine~~ ours) is now split.
Afina (Georgia): wheres the money bet that theres gonna be pushback once theres one more vote to get 10
Afina (Georgia): well aurii has a majority in BNE
Afina (Georgia): even with hal ousted
Bill: Majority means nothing. He has power, which makes it a contested leadership base.
Bill: Not to mention sub groups form without leadership input, such as PA squad.
Aldus (Jess): I didn't see it that way... I mean I saw groups sure "nj" "pa" stuff like that but now it just feels like drama and honestly that makes me really sad
Bill: It's not great.
Bill: I said this this morning, I want to pull back from BNE.
Bill: We've spread there for activity, but it's got to be less personal if it'll survive.
Afina (Georgia): ~~everyone i care about voted for voting~~
Bill: ~~ouch Rei~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~wow can't believe Georgia does care about me~~
Aldus (Jess): JK
Afina (Georgia): i mean everyone i care about didnt vote for anarchy LOL
Afina (Georgia): reiley is just... idk being a wildcard
Afina (Georgia): hunter is a nice guy but idk whats up with him
Afina (Georgia): hals being a douche
Afina (Georgia): meg is just doki for hal
Afina (Georgia): SO
Afina (Georgia): 
Afina (Georgia): Lissy makes it 10
Afina (Georgia): im love lissy
Bill: You're biased Georgia.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oooooo snap really? wow meg
Aldus (Jess): I'm staying out if it all together sowwy
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): [postpones all plans to watch this unfold]
Bill: Hal dropped me from Admin, so?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): W H A T
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): didn't you create the server??
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i was just gonna mention there are too many admins but like WHAT
Bill: Hal did.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): oo
Afina (Georgia): huh
Afina (Georgia): i wonder if i got dropped
Afina (Georgia): how would i know
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): georgia hold on with an iron fist
you're still there for now
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): top right
Bill: You're in the admin category.
Afina (Georgia): yeah im still there for now
Afina (Georgia): werent hal and i originally with our own titles tho
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): it looks like meg was also dropped? or was she not there to begin with?
Afina (Georgia): he was under conversating elusive algerian jhin
Bill: Meg was never admin.
Afina (Georgia): and i was the wisest of rice or something
Bill: He moved the roles.
Afina (Georgia): he moved them or is in the process of moving them?
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): yeah i was looking at that an hour ago u were wisest of rice
Bill: He removed the role from me though, explicitly.
Bill: So.
Bill: Mistake.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): o ur back now
Afina (Georgia): i dont think he would drop the role for me
Afina (Georgia): o yeah youre back
Afina (Georgia): i guess he was just getting rid of titles?
Bill: If he makes a power play I leave, and will invite everyone to a new server.
Afina (Georgia): bold move
Aldus (Jess): UGH this is so much shitty drama
Afina (Georgia): i wouldnt think hes one for power plays
Afina (Georgia): tho he is one for impulsive decisions
Bill: He's just messing around.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): needs **more drama**
Aldus (Jess): No
Aldus (Jess): It doesn't
Elfriede (Tom): *shows up with Starbucks* 
"What I miss"
Afina (Georgia): marisa we can start an instagram war, everyone fite marisa because shes too perfect and too far away to give maximum love to
Aldus (Jess): In my opinion it looked like Hal was trying to organize the roles a little better too make it clearer who the admins are
Afina (Georgia): it would make sense
Afina (Georgia): considering we all had specific titles beforehand
Afina (Georgia): ~~him? organizing? wow the break up really mustbe messed up his brains wiring~~
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): post cosplay images with weapons only
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): hide ciphers in the tag
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): tomu when u get caught up on all this fun, take ur time and there's a new survey in the quest channel!
breathe it all in. the smell of... revolution? and noodles
Afina (Georgia): revolution and noods
Afina (Georgia): no longer netflix and chill
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): each faction gets a different variation of the BNE flag
Elfriede (Tom): I'll definitely check out the survey in a bit
Elfriede (Tom): It's been work to catch up xD
Afina (Georgia): its a WILD TRIP
Afina (Georgia): im interested to hear what tom thinks tho
Elfriede (Tom): But tbh I read through general there and here And also announcements there
Bill: Ye he poked at other roles. Georgia's secondary admin rights from her color roles (I set that, btw) is gone, he removed Dizzy's.
Elfriede (Tom): And it doesn't really seem like anything is going on
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): *he messed with dizzy*
Elfriede (Tom): You guys might be looking too deep
Bill: I don't really care at this point.
Afina (Georgia): whats secondary admin rights?
Bill: You had two roles that gave you admin. Admin, and the color role.
Elfriede (Tom): yeah you do lmao
Bill: So if you weren't an admin, you'd still have rights.
Bill: I dunno what I think then.
Bill: This is asinine.
Afina (Georgia): oh so i didnt lose anything actually tho
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): everything has a hidden meaning and an underlying reason behind it. that's how nic cage got rich after stealing the declaration of independance.
Bill: You still have the admin role itself.
Aldus (Jess): If you didn't actually care you wouldn't be talking about it and you wouldn't be reading into everything
Bill: I'm *curious*.
Bill: tldr Aurii is always safe haven cause BNE has too many people I wouldn't trust with opinions.
Bill: Aurii will go no where.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i'm mainly wound up from the big pushback that hunter gave and then the immediate change in subject
Aldus (Jess): That wasn't even I'm question tho
Afina (Georgia): excuse im fighting marisa for being too perfect
Afina (Georgia): respect our beef billiam
Afina (Georgia): #team marisa is too perfect
Bill: Hunter's...
Afina (Georgia): heart reacts only
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): i'm challenging georgia to a duel because i am a trash child and she is the perfect one, our battle will take place in the pit and refreshments will be served for outrageous prices
Bill: Forget Hunter. You're fine Marisa.
Bill: I have no friggin clue what you're on about Georgia.
Afina (Georgia): 5 dollars for 1 cup of water
Elfriede (Tom): *Nokri is running the Snack stand*
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): if you want a chair to sit in those start at $500
Afina (Georgia): marisa and i are starting a ponzi scheme essentially
Elfriede (Tom): Also so I read hunters reply
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): what is your in-depth topical analysis
Elfriede (Tom): Hunter just seem like he was defending himself and his reason for the channels existance.
Elfriede (Tom): and clearly has an opijion on the voting thing but i dont think he said anything against anyone or anything like that.
Afina (Georgia): yeah i guess, he only actually voted against it
Elfriede (Tom): *also hunter is clearly an emotional fragile person so I wouldn't put too much stock in him getting lightly upset*
Bill: THAT
Bill: YES
Bill: I couldn't find the words earlier.
Elfriede (Tom): Marisa's wording was perfect and you have no reason to feel as though you did something wrong
Elfriede (Tom): not that you do
Elfriede (Tom): but if you do
Elfriede (Tom): stop you good
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): bringing my guilt to the grave that georgia will murder me in
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): in a majestic and graceful manner because she is majesty and grace
Afina (Georgia): whilst we charge 5 dollars for water
Afina (Georgia): bottle not included
Bill: Georgia will murder you over my cold dead body.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): sweet 2 -for-1 deal
Elfriede (Tom): anyways all this will pass
Afina (Georgia): bill did you not get the memo, marisa and i are fighting to prove that the other is perfect
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): also yes no bottle because we're not savages that pollute the oceans
Elfriede (Tom): sept people know billy doesnt like hunter now
Elfriede (Tom): that wont pass
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): unless we're paid extra for it
Afina (Georgia): 5 more dollars for the bottle
Afina (Georgia): 5 MORE dollars for the bottlecap
Bill: Well fuck me.
Afina (Georgia): yeaaaah well thats okay
Afina (Georgia): thats overestimating how much people care
Bill: For you maybe, miss famous.
Elfriede (Tom): also true lmao
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): ye i don't think people will care much. have you ever met hunter irl?
Elfriede (Tom): yeah
Bill: Yeah.
Elfriede (Tom): he took 1 picture of me
Aldus (Jess): People know there is tension now
Afina (Georgia): im like a communist government i cant be touched until my people starve and overthrow me :V ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Afina (Georgia): (1) one picture
Bill: *That can be arranged*
Bill: I can probably bite the bullet and play nice with him over some conversation. idk.
Afina (Georgia): hoWMST WILL YOU STARVE 4K PEOPLE
Bill: I'm at prime salt levels Georgia, don't doubt me right now.
Elfriede (Tom): Hunter is a good photographer but I got them emotional red flags from day 1. That doesnt make him a bad person ofc, it just makes me afraid to say anything to him that actually has weight.
Afina (Georgia): jk more like how will you starve yourselfs, you are my people, da crew, i love you all
Bill: ;;
Afina (Georgia): thats v insightful tom
Bill: Yeah, emotional red flags.
Afina (Georgia): probably very very true
Afina (Georgia): listen a lot of people cry at 4 am but that doesnt mean we all talk about it
Bill: Not the most mature person either.
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): that's a quote of the year right there
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): the crying one
Nokrin rin ring a bell (Marisa): put it in the yearbook
Elfriede (Tom): yeah
Elfriede (Tom): agreed
Elfriede (Tom): and thank
Afina (Georgia): fun to hang out with, not one to put emotional matters with
Aldus (Jess): ~~Ever since entering the cosplay community I think I assume that everyone is emotionaly fragile until proven otherwise~~
Bill: I assume most people have those red flags in the con circuit tbh.
Bill: Fuck Ninjas.
Elfriede (Tom): so I initially got them with Rieley when speaking to them over the server, but Rieley was a lot better irl than online for some reason and it semi got rid of those fears
Elfriede (Tom): (not 100% but somewhat)
Afina (Georgia): its like innocent until proven guilty, unstable until proven solid
Bill: mhmm.
Afina (Georgia): reiley still lacks some emotional maturity
Afina (Georgia): theyre scared to commit to job or college
Afina (Georgia): and im like... b r u h
Afina (Georgia): thats their own prerogative tho
Bill: I would not discuss anything serious with Reiley.
Bill: For Rei's benefit and my own.
Elfriede (Tom): Also I will
Elfriede (Tom): 100%
Elfriede (Tom): everytime
Elfriede (Tom): Spell thier name wrong
Elfriede (Tom): everytime without fail
Afina (Georgia): lmao
Elfriede (Tom): ITS I BEFORE E
Elfriede (Tom): I B E F O R E E
Elfriede (Tom): **english class taught me this way I cant fix it**
Nokrin on heaven's door(Marisa): each time just spell it more and more incorrectly until their name is patricia
Elfriede (Tom): as I spell thier wrong as well lmao
Bill: People in this server are all (mostly) stable people I trust. Which has always been the bar for entry.
Bill: ~~apparently I should add active discord users too~~
Afina (Georgia): i before e except after R, i dont make the rules
Aldus (Jess): That's why I spell my aunt and uncle/landlord's name wrong Everytime I write the check <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Elfriede (Tom): lmaooo
Afina (Georgia): just spell it Rye like rye bread
Bill: ~~I wonder if I @ Sean/Matt/Justin/Rayna, will they see it?
Elfriede (Tom): I usually short it to Rie hahahaha
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): "hey pumpernickel"
Bill: or Allison.
Elfriede (Tom): hey lizi's online
Elfriede (Tom): hewwo
Bill: yeah.
Bill: <@!279360609416642561> hewwo
Bill: Not saying I want to clean the user list of the idlers but.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): it's a great time to join the chat :3c
Elfriede (Tom): not marisa though
Elfriede (Tom): shes offline
Bill: because she won't fucking call out the creep who stalkers her online.
Elfriede (Tom): sometimes I feel like I can still hear her voice
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): i did!!! :3
~~they still constantly message me lol~~
Andrew: rip i dont think ill survive the purge
Bill: BLOCK THEM
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): *but we're in so many mutual servers*
Bill: You're fine Andoru, you post like, one meme a month.
Elfriede (Tom): r i ip andru
Aldus (Jess): Ugh I hate fighting, I'm exhausted and I didn't even do anything, and it wasn't even a big deal
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): several people typing woah
Afina (Georgia): [australian accent] and thus, an andrew emerges from his chambers
Elfriede (Tom): woah
Andrew: *lurks harder*
Bill: knucklehead here just sucks at communication.
Elfriede (Tom): Oi its a jolly good toime innit?
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): tomorrow we'll be like "what were we freaking out over. nothing happened."
BUT RIGHT NOW TENSIONS ARE RUNNING AND WE'RE RIDIN' HIGH BABY
Aldus (Jess): üò≠
Aldus (Jess): No, not high. Looowwww
Bill: ...
Andrew: Oi guvna
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
Bill: Him.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): *him*
Afina (Georgia): riding high yeehaw
Elfriede (Tom): "I'm flying high, baby!"
Afina (Georgia): giddyyup
Bill: Maybe I'll just say fuck it. I don't really like Hunter that much. Fine as a person, but he's annoying as fuck on server. Who cares if that gets out.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): screenshotted and doxxed
Bill: New at 11: Bill is salty.
Afina (Georgia): we havent added anyone who is solely a photographer besides bill until hunter
Afina (Georgia): chalk it up to that, whatever
Elfriede (Tom): I now understand why it asks you that question
Bill: *what a surprise*
Elfriede (Tom): and why it serves no purpose in the english sub
Andrew: <@!184437198865563648> since your salty lets play mario party
Bill: It's his attitude towards things Georgia, not the photographer thing.
Bill: I have the new one.
Afina (Georgia): oh me?
Afina (Georgia): really?
Afina (Georgia): takes up too much time being paparazzi, eh?
Bill: what?
Afina (Georgia): what about his attitude towards me
Bill: I don't like *Hunter's* attitude of treating BNE like a model scouting group. It's a social group.
Bill: Nothing to do with you.
Afina (Georgia): lISTEN I  think we can agree on one thing, if hunter marries casey and thereby prevents her from moving to texas, all will be forgiven
Aldus (Jess): He was addressing you not saying " towards you "
Aldus (Jess): Wuuuut
Afina (Georgia): ah i see now
Afina (Georgia): hunter and casey have spent like the last week together every day, you didnt see?
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): o i thought it meant he had beef with georgia too lol
Bill: I haven't shot you seriously since Otakon, how would I compare photography.
Aldus (Jess): Well yea
Afina (Georgia): and they tease each other in the facebook chat they have
Afina (Georgia): and take selfies together
Afina (Georgia): this whole week, nonstop
Aldus (Jess): But I don't think Casey would take him up on that offer.
Afina (Georgia): v flirty if you ask me
Afina (Georgia): idk, it could be enough to just cause a little doubt in her mind
Afina (Georgia): i know im thinking very hopeful, but still :/
Aldus (Jess): I mean that would be nice but
Bill: teasing, jokes, and selfies don't mean anything.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): they do when you scrutinize everything
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): *it's a sign*
Bill: They still don't.
Afina (Georgia): a whole week together tho üòè
Afina (Georgia): flirting back and forth
Afina (Georgia): billiam plz if anyone plays shipper its you
Afina (Georgia): even if you dont like him, you have to admit hes better than ethan
Elfriede (Tom): *casey'snevergonnaleaveethanimsorry*
Bill: I don't hate him, he's better than Ethan, I'm justing saying that's not clear signs of flirting.
Bill: I apparently suck at shipper, so I should retire.
Afina (Georgia): you ship tom and jess
Afina (Georgia): thats a definite win
Bill: ,...
Aldus (Jess): ~~we we're allready canon when he started shipping it tho~~
Elfriede (Tom): thats like shipping Ren and Nora lmao
Elfriede (Tom): wait..
Afina (Georgia): illuminati confirmed
Afina (Georgia): tom and jess are ren and nora
Afina (Georgia): ~~hal is pyrrha thats why hes dead to us now~~
Afina (Georgia): thats not a salty joke btw i just thought it was really clever
Bill: ~~yeah you salty~~
Afina (Georgia): thanks marisa
Afina (Georgia): that one wasnt salty
Afina (Georgia): other times im salty but not in that specific example
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): i did that thing where u quickly exhale air from your nostrils to signify humor
Elfriede (Tom): Yes
Elfriede (Tom): that
Elfriede (Tom): ‚òù
Afina (Georgia): thats what i aim for
Elfriede (Tom): ~~I will say that Hal has disapointed me in the last week or so and has hurt my impression of him which was alright before that oops~~
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): yeah same
Bill: from what?
Afina (Georgia): good job with tom, jess, thats a good one right there, makin good judgements about people
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): he's makin' weird decisions, just from what i see in bne and instagram
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): not necessarily bad, just unnecessary or strange
Aldus (Jess): Ye hes neat
Bill: neat? or is that in response to Georgia, who I don't know who she's talking to.
Aldus (Jess): Tom is neat
Afina (Georgia): i told jess that toms a good because i agree with his opinion
Bill: Ah.
Bill: Got it.
Afina (Georgia): and he didnt say it the immature way that i say "hals a douche"
Afina (Georgia): he says "hal has disappointed me"
Afina (Georgia): like someone who actually shouldnt be disappointed
Afina (Georgia): ew okay im not gonna look in general for a bit please and thank
Afina (Georgia): someone let me know when the coast is clear
Afina (Georgia): _marisa we need safe for work sasuke_
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): SORRY I WAS MAKING A THING I'LL GO GET HIM
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Jess:
Elfriede (Tom): oh wow thank
Afina (Georgia): omg

Aldus (Jess): WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT
Bill: *Block*.
Bill: *his*
Bill: *account*.
Bill: He's a *creep*, he *won't* take a hint, you need to stand up to him.
Bill: As far as I'm concerned, you're basically Jess if she let dick pic guy keep messaging her.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): but we share so many circles and EM doesn't have a block feature
Bill: Block him *everywhere else*.
Bill: You are changing *your* lifestyle to avoid him, *this is what the blocking features are for*.
Afina (Georgia): block him!
Bill: 
Bill: That's Marisa.
Bill: 
Bill: Mikakunin is the best.
Bill: 
Bill: Why isn't deviant art dead yet?
Bill: I feel like it's not much of a community anymore.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): it's like a cockroach
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: It's just a hell of furry and inflation fetishes
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): just like a cockroach
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ooohohoho nice name
Bill: I must not look at the same deviantart you do, I see the furry but no inflation stuff.
Bill: ~~looking at the lewds eh~~
Aldus (Jess): ~~if your using deviant art for lewds, you're looking in the wrong place~~
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Lmao no I would never use deviant art for lewds pllzzzz
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Thanks Mars san
Bill: Deviant art is absolutely the right place for lewds.
Bill: Of poorly drawn sonic OCs.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: That are inflated
Bill: ~~that i don't see~~
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: How could you miss the inflation shit my God it's everyone e
Bill: Though I only check my notifications page for the artists I follow.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Ah yes yes
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): danbooru and konachan are basically all lewd unless u safesearch
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah pm
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Danbooru at least had some quality mixed in
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Zero chan had some good stuff
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: (non lewd good stuff let me clarify)
Bill: ~~I just ran through the top 50 hot posts, I saw nothing inflation~~
Bill: ~~are you sure you weren't looking for it~~
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Search a fandom
Bill: Did find THIS though.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Oh
Aldus (Jess): WHAT THE FUCK
Bill: ~~still not finding anything Tomu
Bill: Safebooru is a pre filterd Danbooru.
Bill: Sankaku is as big as Danbooru, but also hella lewd without content filters.
Bill: E-shuushuu is non lewd, but has a strict 'must have a girl in the picture' rule, so useless for male solo fanart.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Yeah eshuushuu is trash for that
Bill: works for shipping or female art tho.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i saw inflation mina art the other day and cried
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): biru who's the artist of that piece u posted. is it bleedman. looks like bleedman.
Bill: it was.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): CALLED IT
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): i wish i had my APUSH textbook

Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): mawisa-quest's life force is aurii
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): it's where the magic comes from
Bill: sorry, I *am* on record stating fantasy is a boring setting.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): ~~u were the only one to vote non-fantasy whoops~~ but i'm tryna avoid too many fantasy cliches while also sticking to a typical fantasy setting? like, i'm taking inspiration from a ton of random worldly fables and legends. i've also got ideas for foreshadowing and references and whatnot so if you think something is a connection i'd like to hear your theory :3c ~~even the name gave me a ton of trouble ugh. it was almost melusine but that didn't sound very 1900s america~~
Bill: I know I'm the only one.
Bill: It's why I'd like to BNHA/RWBY, maybe urban fantasy, or potentially scifi.
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I don't wanna do something in a pre existing anime world sorry fam
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I'd have to be a huge fan of the series for.me to do that
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: That would require like fallout or dark souls
Bill: Fallout has a fan made PnP...
Bill: I considered it at one point.
Bill: Dark souls is still pretty fantasy.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ahhh so much to catch up on but i goota pee nyoom
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Nyoom
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Nyoom
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): i'll find all the mistakes i made in the morning <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: These dimensions are for a wallet.
Bill: What.
Bill: am I doing this wrong, cause 175mm is *long*
Bill: I am doing it wrong, read the ruler wrong.
Bill: I think it's smaller than my wallet owo
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Get one of those wallets that lights on fire
Bill: That sounds terrible.
Bill: I carry cash.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): But it‚Äôll be cool
Bill: I just wish they'd stop doing RFID proof cards.
Bill: I have two cards I need to tap to use, my path card and office card.
Bill: They include one pocket that's not blocked, but the other pockets prevent me from using the card without taking it out of my wallet.
Nokrin on heaven's door (Marisa): Don‚Äôt forget your... *ninja info cards.*
Bill: ~~The wallet has secret pockets~~
Bill: Am I going to get an 80 dollar wallet?
Bill: I wish reddit had a nicer interface.
Bill: I'd use it more.
Bill: HA
Bill: So Canada legalized pot, saw that this morning on the newsfeeds.
Bill: I just got an email from HR to sign a "Substance Management Policy".
Bill: *I wonder why*
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Lmaooo
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I heard NJ was due end of October
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: Dunno how true
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nicu
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I think it's a double standard to have alcohol legal and not pot, but I don't support either so <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Are you Elfriede of the dark?: I'm certainly more comfortable with alcohol because we grew up around it
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
