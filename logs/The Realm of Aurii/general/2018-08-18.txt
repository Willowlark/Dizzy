Eliran (Halim): BILL LOOK WE MADE IT TO KATSUCON
Bill: I’m not the one with the gazebo obsession.
Aldus (Jess): Oh dang dat beach look nice 👌
Elfriede (Tom): WOO KATSUCON
Elfriede (Tom): WERE HERE
Elfriede (Tom): Look there's Marisa
Nokri (Marisa): KERORO IS HWRE ANS HE TOUCHED NY SHOUKDWE AAAA
Nokri (Marisa): AAAAAA
Elfriede (Tom): AHHHHH
Nokri (Marisa): omg the girl in front of me has fish for feet. Like. Fish shoes omg
Nokri (Marisa): THESE
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): I just had a photoshoot with a guy who spoke perfect English and it was surreal. Started out in Japanese when he mentioned that he lived in the US so I was like “oh do you speak English” and he’s like “yeah of course I speak English that’s a given” and I just mentally exploded
Nokri (Marisa): Biru come quick the whole room is jamming to the kaito kid theme song
Nokri (Marisa): We got glow sticks and crazy dancers
Bill: ~~is this Manaka?~~
Nokri (Marisa): No this is Patrick
Bill: Fucking hell my grey card disappeared at Otakon.
Nokri (Marisa): What a grey card
Nokri (Marisa): *the photog whose pictures were on my Twitter was at Acosta today and took my pictures again*
We were exchanging contact info and he was like “wait a minute”
Bill: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kinetic-love-days-software#/ Army waifu visual novel.
Elfriede (Tom): Like credit card? That blowsw
Bill: No, it's a plastic card for metering light.
Elfriede (Tom): Oh
Bill: Which sounds mundane, but cost like 10 bucks and is *really* useful.
Bill: 10 bucks for a piece of plastic, which annoys me all the more; I barely convinced myself to get the first oen.
Elfriede (Tom): That's neet about the photag
I suppose it's neet when anyone speaks English at all
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah.. I gotcha
Nokri (Marisa): ye you get the occasional English speaker or someone who wants to practice. They sound very textbook-y though. This was the first person I’ve met in japan who was like. Fluent and natural. I teach people to be fluent and natural but there’s still something off about it. This guy was 100% from “撮影いただいてよろしいでしょうか？” to “are you sure Camden is on par with Chicago because I’m gonna have to fight that”
Nokri (Marisa): and then the next guy was like “your Japanese is so good! Here’s a card without Japanese so you can understand it since you probably can’t read anything.”
Nokri (Marisa): I had a line again wowee first time at Acosta. I didn’t powder my wig because it was at night and I was lazy. *i should have powdered my wig*
So many flashes and fancy light stands
Bill: Does that work to make the wig less reflective?
Nokri (Marisa): Less shiny ye
Nokri (Marisa): It makes it a little paler but much duller. Also helps to soak it in a fabric softener mix for three days
Bill: Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.
Nokri (Marisa): How many days you wanna leave a bucket of fabric softener sitting around
You could do five but it absorbs at a whatever the opposite of exponential rate is
Nokri (Marisa): I did two days and it was decent
Nokri (Marisa): Am I banned
Bill: no?
Nokri (Marisa): sad!
Bill: excuse, you want to be banned?
Nokri (Marisa): On epicmafia we have art and singing contests and stuff where the winner is banned for a week it’s very competitive
Bill: There are no active links to this server, so any ban is a permaban.
Nokri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): Maybe we ourselves are the ban
Nokri (Marisa): My phone says the bus stop I need is Chizuka but it’s called Senzoku. Get with it, google. Kanji are fun.
Nokri (Marisa): The Moon is pretty nice tonight. Half moon. Nice.
Nokri (Marisa): Can’t wait for that waxing gibbous
Nokri (Marisa): The US needs anison events like japan has but they probably wouldn’t work as well. But it was fun seeing a whole room jam to fighting dreamers
Afina (Georgia🍀): Kirsten posted her swimming in her new mermaid tail
Afina (Georgia🍀): And I was like damn that's rad I wonder how much that costs
Afina (Georgia🍀): 370 dolla for a mermaid tail, like damn that must be a good business to be in
Afina (Georgia🍀): Mermaid tail maker lol
Bill: Ye. Whole thing is cool. I wanna see at CCE.
Elfriede (Tom): Exponential decay is the opposite I believe
Elfriede (Tom): Late but
Bill: Yo so Gord told me about this thing called Tiger Balm which you rub into sore muscles.
Bill: Holy fuck it spicy.
Aldus (Jess): Probably has capsaicin
Bill: I’m dying I’m so tired and I’m helping car shop (still)
Elfriede (Tom): Lmaooooo
Elfriede (Tom): They are never gonna pick a car
Elfriede (Tom): It's like the kitchen
Elfriede (Tom): That halarious that they are still going
Elfriede (Tom): And yeah I m so tired dude
Elfriede (Tom): I need moar coffee
Bill: We just stumbled into an Infiniti dealership. Holy shit I want to trade my car in.
Bill: And I mean, when you’re looking at luxury tier you have to be sure of what your buying.
Bill: They’re close with the BMW, and Infiniti is a apparent dark horse.
Aldus (Jess): Babe make a k cup
Aldus (Jess): Also: "these damn rich people"
Bill: :3
Bill: They deserve and need it tho. Me and katy are on our own, moms knee is bad, they’re just in need of something comfortable.
Bill: I just tried to use a Mac mousepad gesture on my tablet. Lightroom mobile has come far; its got me thinking I’m on my compooper.
