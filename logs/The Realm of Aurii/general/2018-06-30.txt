Nokri (Marisa): i had a nightmare last night where i returned to the US on a whim but realized i had work in 2 days and it days 2 days to fly back and i wouldn't make it to work in time it was horrible
Bill: Ye, I mean, fuck your work if you came back we’d all keep you here.
Afina (Georgia🍀): YEAH SCREW WORK
Nokri (Marisa): but the counselors would have to cancel all my bookings and my clients would have to reschedule and the ISL would probably be super disappointed and i would fail everyone and they'd give me low ratings 🙀
Nokri (Marisa): lookie i got a regular client that i might've stolen from arzu oops
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): I, for one, welcome our bureaucratic work-centered soul-sucking dictatorship.
Afina (Georgia🍀): my car needed its oil changed today so i pulled it into the service drive before i sat down to work
Afina (Georgia🍀): apparently its good that i needed it changed cause someone had gotten dislodged from my engine
Afina (Georgia🍀): and spilled oil all over the engine
Afina (Georgia🍀): its not a super $$$ job but its important to the engine so its good im gettin it fixed before driving up to yall today
Bill: *someone* had?
Nokri (Marisa): sorry for your turm*oil*
Bill: that was BAD, I love it.
Nokri (Marisa): it wasn't me i didn't spill the oil
Nokri (Marisa): last person to say not it did it

Afina (Georgia🍀): because its not too busy today im hoping they can buff the paint off the side of my car too
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~fromt bumping the garage door oops~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): my mom was all "this is a good teaching moment for you" and told them to take off the pieces of the car that broke and show me whats being replaced
Nokri (Marisa): is she gonna make u take a test on it
Afina (Georgia🍀): hopefully not i know nothin bout cars
Afina (Georgia🍀): i only know the sales side of it, and even that, just barely
Afina (Georgia🍀): tho i also know that you have to maintain the brakes, oil, and tires otherwise theyre gonna affect bigger parts of the vehicle and youll have to pay thousands of dollars
Nokri (Marisa): is that going to be on the test
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye
Afina (Georgia🍀): as much as ill complain about work because everyone complains about their job, one of my coworkers just told me to take a mac and cheese break and leave the phone on auto-answer
Elfriede (Tom): Macand cheese break?
Elfriede (Tom): Is that a normal occurrence
Afina (Georgia🍀): i feel like im being prepped for bad news or something cause my coworker literally got me mac and cheese, biscuits, and lemonade
Afina (Georgia🍀): he went to popeyes to get himself chicken but thats some THOROUGH georgia-analysis to know that lemonade and mac and cheese are my shit
Elfriede (Tom): Hmmmm
Elfriede (Tom): Is it thorough tho <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Bill: Which is not a bad thing, except it won’t be a *Truck*.
Bill: Probably.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😭 ~~oh no a normie car~~
Aldus (Jess): Up here the truck is the normie car 😂
Afina (Georgia🍀): true~
Afina (Georgia🍀): appparently even though my car is old (2012) and has 40K miles on it, its still valuable because its one of the last lines of pick up trucks that GMC made that were mid-size
Afina (Georgia🍀): since then, theyve only made big trucks
Afina (Georgia🍀): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> makes me feel a little bit cooler now
Elfriede (Tom): my 99 saturn with its cane
Elfriede (Tom): "Back in my day"

Elfriede (Tom): and has hit 2 deer without repair
Elfriede (Tom): but our veloster is '13
Afina (Georgia🍀): you still have value on the '99 do you know?
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean i would assume so, we had a 2004 envoy with 200,000 miles and still got like 4K for it
Aldus (Jess): Nah it worth like $600
Afina (Georgia🍀): ye i mean if you keep up with regular oil changes, tire rotations, and break pad replacements, all the other pieces last a whole lot longer
Afina (Georgia🍀): so you guys must have just been nice to your ♥ cars
Elfriede (Tom): it was 3k when i got it
Aldus (Jess): You got it 8 yrs ago 😂
Elfriede (Tom): but yeah its like 600 now
Elfriede (Tom): with the dmg its prob 300
Elfriede (Tom): prob worth more as scrap then as a car
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean it doesnt sound like it gives you issues
Elfriede (Tom): but it runs great
Elfriede (Tom): it has a few issues
Bill: Y’all still haven’t left? I need Jess to guilt Katy into the water.

Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~the garritys wanna be as close to my arrival time as possible so i dont feel bad about being late 😏 ~~
Elfriede (Tom): oh the back rear window doesnt function either
Elfriede (Tom): and all the tires deflate kinda fast
Elfriede (Tom): but i cant just ditch the car cuz it still works
Bill: ~~No one is every on time when I do anything~~

Elfriede (Tom): 65mph
Elfriede (Tom): it starts to make noise but
Elfriede (Tom): i only drive it tops 50 on the way to work so im not gonna replace the bearings >w>
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~not my fault i work to bring home that bacon billiam~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean worst case scenario the car dies and you have to replace it, which i feel like everyone has come to terms with the fact that they have to replace a car EVENTUALLY
Aldus (Jess): I am ready... Finally also merica
