Aldus (Jess): yea but ive worked my birthday the past like 7 years lol
Aldus (Jess): unless it was a weekend
Afina (Georgia🍀): My birthdays a Sunday otherwise I would probably be picking up some hours
Afina (Georgia🍀): Like there's no point trying to celebrate during the day cause everyone else is at work anyways
Aldus (Jess): yea i mean i like to have it off even if im all alone but like at that age and working part time its pretty much expected
Aldus (Jess): georgia, should we bring anything to your party? games? foods? what you need?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Her hours that day were 8-2 pm anyways so
Afina (Georgia🍀): Uhhhhh good question!
Afina (Georgia🍀): _dont bring extra blankets we don't need them_ jk if you wanna bring sleeping stuff so you know you're comfy that's probably smart
Afina (Georgia🍀): Otherwiiiise? I'm pretty much ok I think

Aldus (Jess): *brings blow up pool*
Aldus (Jess): probably going to try to get a new air mattress since ours died

Afina (Georgia🍀): I don't know Diff Eq girl well enough 😭 Tyler I at least hung out with all last semester
Afina (Georgia🍀): Also my favorite machine at the gym is dead so I'm at a loss of what to do
Aldus (Jess): is it the stair machine?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nah the assisted pull up machine
Afina (Georgia🍀): Half my arm routine is that machine so I guess it's leg day now lol
Aldus (Jess): ooo whats dat?
Afina (Georgia🍀): The assisted pull up machine? It's pull ups, and it has a couple different bars
Afina (Georgia🍀): And then there's a waist-high bar
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I do pull ups but I also push up off the middle bar
Afina (Georgia🍀): And it has somewhere for your knees so it helps you do the pull ups a bit
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~which is the only reason I can do 3 sets of 60~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Omg the one guy in my Diff Eq class is here, I swear he comes in to do squats for an hour and leaves, his thighs must be so strong
