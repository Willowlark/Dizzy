Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): ggghhhh I’m awake
Bill: ,...
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): I definitely did not fall asleep ~~for more than 3 hours~~
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Dave partying it up down there
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): 🎉
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Nooo why did you stop
Dirty Lego (Tom): if yall wanna see me die and have liteerally nothing else to do
https://www.twitch.tv/fenrillz Im doing my first shitty stream!
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): How long are you doing it for!?
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): I can’t stay I’m on mobile and attempting to cook but I’d watch an archived version after
Bill: Maybe I need to consider its 500 bucks I’m spending on the *off* chance of use for portraits, which is what I like to shoot most now.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Why 500?
Bill: Cheapest option is 200 bucks for two softboxes with stands. They're smaller soft boxes than Hunter had, and I'm worried they won't have a wide enough illumination area. Getting a larger one can be between 100-250, a piece. Additionally, for 50~120 bucks I get a third light and stand for backlighting. 

Then I got the pitch for a very popular speedlight (flash unit) that's 180. Mountable to camera, remote trigger compatible. I was considering getting one of those, because I lack a flash and this one would be useful. So add that to the softbox scenario.

THEN, the recommendation of the store is to use speedlights for portraits rather than continuous lights. For a similar price, I can get two stands, two mounts, and two speed lights with a remote trigger. This lets me do a studio setup based off two flashes, which is more portable and apparently better according to the community. The lights come with defusers too, to get a softer look like the speedlight.
Bill: Then I have to weight that cost versus use.
Bill: Cause I did what, 3 location shoots last year?
Bill: How much indoor cosplay/portrait am I going to do? Am I going to do any non cosplay stuff with it?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Sounds like you're not ready purchase anything yet
Bill: Deciding between softboxes and flashes is one thing, but takes to two to portrait shoot.
Bill: Ah, the mounts in the softbox kit can be used with the speed light adaptors too... so that 200/319 can eliminate the 60 for the stands alone.
Bill: Even if I buy one of the flashes for my own experimenting, the whole set of gear is about 500... I doubt I could get 10 bucks via kofi let alone that. That avenue seems pointless.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): girl scout cookie season is coming up soon

Bill: Genius.
Bill: Ugh. I'm partly not sure if I'd be spending that for me or other people, and a chance of using them for other people at that. I think that's what I'm mostly caught up on.
N🆗ri (Marisa): get it for selfies
Dirty Lego (Tom): Woah,Mitch is in Japan
Dirty Lego (Tom): I didn't know he was going
Dirty Lego (Tom): Imagine that, I finally know someone who's been to japan

N🆗ri (Marisa): Now what’s your MiB type? :3
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~my wut?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I like the third one the best but I think it’s the soundtrack. The theme song is catchy. The plot of the second one is a bit weak but still funny. I heard they’re making a fourth.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): men in black?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i never seen t 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah <:lenny:395307171539189760>

N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m just gonna materialize in your house one day and monopolize the tv for like a month
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): okey dokey
Bill: ~~she'll watch it when you block that one dude~~
Bill: Tangentially, you'd need a ride to come see us, right Mawisa?
N🆗ri (Marisa): [blocks random guy] there we go
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ll walk
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not so bad
Bill: More like a day and a half.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just like our ancestors walked a thousand miles to watch the premiere of Casablanca
Bill: so yes, you'd need a ride.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I could roll there. Just roll on the ground. Good times.
Bill: ~~it is in your best interest to answer me normally, this is for the mystic messenger sleepover we totally need to do`~
N🆗ri (Marisa): MYSTIC MESS SLUMBER PARTY WOOO
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): A WHAT NOW
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ll be up near Trenton for a wedding the weekend before Katsu
Bill: We talked about this way back when. When Georgia did her rwby sleepover.
Bill: ~~you know, cause I have a complex about being replaced~~
Bill: ~~he even says "I'm a bad person"; *that's my thing*~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is OK he doesn’t even acknowledge my existence so I’ll always be on your side ;u;
Bill: 💙
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~theres no sides to be had~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): This is a complex dodecahedron there are many sides like the foot pain side or the tissue paper side
N🆗ri (Marisa): The side that only plays opera music on Wednesday’s
Bill: Marisa knows whats up.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Good ol’ inferiority 
Knowing that no matter how badly I’m burning my fingers right now I’ll never be as good as anyone else <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 👌
Bill: You are decidedly a pro cosplayer though.
N🆗ri (Marisa): But no?
Bill: but yes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 0 awards 0 fame 0 people who recognize me
I’m glad dizzy made that cosplay exhibit because I can admire costumes up close without freaking people out. I like looking at little details people make.
Bill: *this is Jess smacking the two of us over the head*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~yea~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess is a literal angel descended from the heavens tho
Bill: 100%.
Bill: It's not about other people Mawisa! Cosplay judges imo suck, they seem to focus on weird personal details to them. You pro because you can make an entire costume that looks T O P  T I E R in 3 days.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea you gots da skills
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): plus is for fun!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Bottom tier
I just have too much free time <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
Ye!! Is fun! I love sitting backstage with everyone and the shenanigans that happen and waiting in line is how I met a lot of cool people
I just feel like it’s also a waste of money sometimes because the stuff I make is bad and could be spent on other more helpful things
Bill: TOP TIER
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): all hobbies, in essence are a "waste" of money
Bill: Also yes.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but thats not what matters. its not about money it about living a life
N🆗ri (Marisa): What’s that
Bill: ~~where you live your dream and live in japan for a year~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Freaky
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): or just having experiences and having fun. no one was born just to pay bills and die
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): its a crying shame that so many people dont have much choice in the matter
N🆗ri (Marisa): When the political revolution happening when are we having a nationwide riot
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): tomorrow
N🆗ri (Marisa): Cool I’ll bring the covfefe
Dirty Lego (Tom): Good job Jess 👌 🙏
Dirty Lego (Tom): Oh an Ashe keeps asking about how we're getting her up here to watch The Night is Short Walk on Girl
Dirty Lego (Tom): Cuz she has
Bill: right, back to get Marisa up here.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I walk
N🆗ri (Marisa): I guess I just don’t think of cosplay as a very social thing. It’s more of a thing that accompanies social events. Like how you dress in business attire for a formal meeting, you dress in cosplay for an anime convention. But I’m too shy to speak to people so I sit in the corner of the formal meeting eating the free food.
Bill: I do that. Minus the food.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Business meeting sugar free cookies are good
Bill: It's easier to follow up with people you've met online.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i rarely meet new people at conventions
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just talk to people i already know
Bill: Tho, Zenkai'17 Gen posted 'anyone from the rwby shoot friday want to hang and chat (sunday)?' and I went. It was her rob, mark and Audrey but just going to that was like... groundbreaking.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah I talk to people I know but it’s usually a short, cordial conversation. For 10 years I’ve conned solo so I know how to meet people but we don’t really hang out for long ;3c
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but now you have people to chill with!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg we can get ice from the ice machine and literally chill
Bill: yeah cons used to be panels and shopping... Georgia has introduced us to the art of 'sitting in a convention hall way for 4 hours hanging out'.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Whaaat
Nooo who has time for that??
N🆗ri (Marisa): At a con?????
Bill: ~~Anyone at Saikoucon, what a lame con~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): marisa ill go to some panels with you! i never go to enough and i feel dumb
N🆗ri (Marisa): There was a really good Noragami one a few Otakons ago
N🆗ri (Marisa): The big event I go to that takes up the most time is the masquerade
N🆗ri (Marisa): Those used to be the highlights of a con
Bill: Marisa did really good when Zeikani kidnapped us at Kotori for a bit. I had to ask if Marisa knew them (they live by her).
N🆗ri (Marisa): I forgot the dance for renai circulation I sucked
Bill: That's okay.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Fuwa fuwari fuwa fuwaru
N🆗ri (Marisa): I keep molding plastic to my pants
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH YEAH i forgot i got karuta's outfit over black friday lol
i'm gonna use karuta's shirt for ray
Bill: YASSSS I may have burnt my eggs yesterday but today I made the perfect omelette.
Bill: And before it gets warm we gotta go do karaoke in fort lee or New York.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): why before it gets warm?
Bill: Not like there’s much else to do in the winter, why waste a warm weekend we could spend outside?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): spend day in city, then do kareeoee at night!
Bill: That’d be a warm thing. I do that too tho.
Bill: Warm weekend just mean potential shoots and I wanna location shoot more.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Karaoke! Karaoke!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Post Instagram-level pics of your omelette
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): the diea of even walking in the city when its cold makes me wanna retreat
Bill: So NYC trip into Karaoke into long sleepy ride home.
Bill: It's aplan.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Sewing when no one is home is karaoke time. I’ve been singing kami no manimani on repeat for 4 hours. Any requests.
Bill: ~~how about that song you sang for Japanese class~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): we barge into rowan singing tsubasa wo kudasai
Bill: ~~you, me and andrew passed the kanji test~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ***the kanji test***
Dirty Lego (Tom): Been singing tomyo ghoul op1 for the passed 4 days
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): GOOD
N🆗ri (Marisa): *oshiete yo oshiete yo*
N🆗ri (Marisa): im excited i really like the muslin i made despite it being a fraying satin mess. it's exactly the right size though so I *can't gain any weight whatsoever* in the next month or it won't fit at all lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): Flippin’ 30 seconds to figure out the mystic mess theme on flute and 3 hours to figure out the opening bars on violin. Aaaa
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

Bill: thank god we're all private sector.
Bill: Think about that, NASA girl.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 96% of NASA employees arent doing work right now, dont remind me 😭
Bill: ~~Also if NASA is on the GS pay scale, you won't exactly get rich from it, fyi. GS scale is rather slow, much slower than private sector opportunities~~

~~*The trade off of that is job security butIMEAN*~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Build ur own private space company
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): benefits are usually good tho, i think?
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: *ifffff* you're getting them. =/
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): pension is good ye
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ah yea 4:30
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): discord is always ded this time o day

Dirty Lego (Tom): GON LEARN TODAY
Dirty Lego (Tom): NO 1: WELL DONE IS THE DEVILS WORD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): he already failed
Dirty Lego (Tom): Nah tbh some chicken or steak isn't hard
Dirty Lego (Tom): Esp if your goal is no pink on the steak
Dirty Lego (Tom): Getting some pink is harder
Dirty Lego (Tom): Just gotta learn seasoning
Dirty Lego (Tom): Pan sear and bake, or grill but it's cold as shit
Bill: Or, cut up precooked keilbasa in the fry pan, cool long enough to heat it and not long enough to char.
Bill: I feel like I’m missing something from when I did it at college, but meh.
N🆗ri (Marisa): What’s a kielbasa
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): It's like a sausage but not chonky
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess):
