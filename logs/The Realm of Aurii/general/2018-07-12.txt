Nokri (Marisa): hashtag aldus did nothing wrong
Nokri (Marisa): nokri would be devastated don't do it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri: I've only known her an hour and if anything happened to Afina I'd kill everyone in this room and myself

Afina (Georgia🍀): Nokri, sweating: yeah....
Aldus (Jess): Aldus in the crowd, in his disguise, laughing his ass off
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede:I didn't lie! I just chose not to tell you!
Elfriede (Tom): "I'm technically only half Lego!"
Nokri (Marisa): *lies by omission*
Nokri (Marisa): if the marriage ever goes south nokri can say it was never binding because her name is fake and just run away
but why would she do that
Elfriede (Tom): And because I doubt it'll ever come up again: Elfriede's Dad is the human.
Nokri (Marisa): elfriede's dad is a furry
Aldus (Jess): i thought that was a secret!
Elfriede (Tom): It was but like, I thought to myself. Why.
Aldus (Jess): yea
Elfriede (Tom): Like there's no benefit to me keeping it a secret cuz noone will ever know then
Aldus (Jess): YEET
Afina (Georgia🍀): *pants Elfriedes family* AHA PLOT
Elfriede (Tom): I HAVE LOCATED THE PLOT
Aldus (Jess): your gonna pull down their pants?!
Afina (Georgia🍀): I was guessing that cause it was Aria that asked the deep question but also elfies dad made the "chasing tail" joke so idk
Elfriede (Tom): YOUR MOM HAS A TAIL
Aldus (Jess): elfys dads a tail chaser
Elfriede (Tom): He saw dat 🍑 and was like "oomph, you may be a furry but I gotta get me that 🍑 "
Elfriede (Tom): Aroa is just in general more concerned about the whole hiding identity thing.
Nokri (Marisa): gotta get that fruit to avoid scurvy
Elfriede (Tom): ☝ ☝
Aldus (Jess): lmao
Afina (Georgia🍀): Prob cause she's been doing it for forever
Afina (Georgia🍀): How far back in the faun family does hiding it go?
Elfriede (Tom): I'd say 4gens
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede and Afina being the forth
Elfriede (Tom): Oof
Elfriede (Tom): I wrote afina
Elfriede (Tom): Failure

Elfriede (Tom): Lmao Tru dat
Aldus (Jess): unless his dad took her name
Aldus (Jess): PLOT HOLE
Elfriede (Tom): New Eraian custom
Elfriede (Tom): Just established
Elfriede (Tom): To honor lylalels female form the women keep thier sernames
Elfriede (Tom): Take notes <@184437198865563648>
Aldus (Jess): explaining your plot hole away

Elfriede (Tom): Oh wait I maybe can on the character sheet
Aldus (Jess): its Larian like the compant that make divinity
Elfriede (Tom): YEAH
Elfriede (Tom): THATS RIGHT DERP
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Elfriede (Tom): AIGHT THO, CANON
Elfriede (Tom): Eraian men are usually accustomed to take the females name.
Aldus (Jess): what if they gey
Elfriede (Tom): That's why I wrote usually
Elfriede (Tom): Idk eraias customs on gey
Aldus (Jess): ooooo
Aldus (Jess): just write em youself since you allready doin it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): If they are taking after the regular Catholic Church of old they'd obviously be against it but otherwise I would figure the one with more social. status would keep it.
Aldus (Jess): i mean the catholic church probs would support female names either so i dont thinkt hat matters
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah truth
Nokri (Marisa): Years later Nokri takes him to meet her parents and they’re like “oh you took his last name and it’s lyleon? Wow” and she’s like “yeah let’s go with that
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah lmaoo
Elfriede (Tom): 🙏 🙏
Afina (Georgia🍀): YO I SUPPORT THE FEMALE LAST NAME LORE
Afina (Georgia🍀): --billiam make it so_
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I wanna make that canon now 👌
Elfriede (Tom): Plz
Aldus (Jess): nokris parents come to visit elfriede's
Aldus (Jess): he trys to arrest them
Nokri (Marisa): What if you just put the two last names together so after like 10 generations everyone has a SUPER long last name
Bill: Need to think on that one. It’s not quite clicking for Eraia lore but there like, spark is there for it too.
Bill: Kinda need the Lylalel logic behind it or what not.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lylalel is woman, woman is suPERIOR
Elfriede (Tom): That's why I said the Lylalel logic fammm
Nokri (Marisa): Lylalel was homo
Nokri (Marisa): Or female that works better
Aldus (Jess): NICE
Afina (Georgia🍀): LYLALEL IS A LESBIAN TRY TO CHANGE MY MIND
Elfriede (Tom): Although then there would be more women in power too
Elfriede (Tom): Maybe there is
Elfriede (Tom): Just haven't seen em yet
Aldus (Jess): LyalelxYuria
Nokri (Marisa): U ever hear that song God is a Girl
That’s lyleosolol
Bill: Like, Dreca could easily have the culture that you take the last name of the person who has the higher military record.
Bill: Eraia is not a female dominant country, sorry.
Bill: Lots of old wrinkly dudes making the rules.
Aldus (Jess): what if neither is military?
Nokri (Marisa): Nokri gonna seduce the ruler of dreca
Bill: ~~it is a religious civilization after all~~
Aldus (Jess): o-ohhh?
Bill: Higher status.
Bill: Basically you take the name of the person who has more to bring to the family.
Elfriede (Tom): If you won't make that the lore then I'll just go with jorund took her name as the rest of the Faun's did.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Laera is higher status so ELFRIEDE TYNDALL IT IS
Bill: I gotta reread lore to get in the mind set.
Aldus (Jess): what if you are evenly yolked?
Afina (Georgia🍀): thumb wrestle who gets it
Bill: It might work Tom. Not a refusal, just can’t confirm rn.
Bill: Need lunch.
Aldus (Jess): maybe whoever is older?
Bill: I guess?
Nokri (Marisa): Thumb wrestle for canon
Elfriede (Tom): Whose older, Elfie or Afrin
Elfriede (Tom): Why haven't I considered this
Elfriede (Tom): I think Elfie buly one or two years
Aldus (Jess): cuz everyone made their charcter like 21-26
Bill: There’s always going to be some difference which would weight the marriage. More cattle, better family.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ye elfies older by a year I think
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afrin 22
Afina (Georgia🍀): ~~Not that I know what that age is like~~
Nokri (Marisa): Wow biru you cant just call harem members cattle
Elfriede (Tom): Oop Elfriede is 24
Aldus (Jess): lmao
Aldus (Jess): aluds is 23
Nokri (Marisa): Except in the last monster Musume arc where they’re literally cow girls
Afina (Georgia🍀): I thought he needed a wife by 24 or the Eraian dudes would play matchmaker
Elfriede (Tom): Almost 25 I wrote that it was a few months til his birthday
Elfriede (Tom): It was 25
Nokri (Marisa): Birthday party when
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriedes birthday should be coming up soon in game
Aldus (Jess): afina doesnt come cuz she mad at him for being a lego
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): OOOOO not good™
Nokri (Marisa): She sends one of those confetti bomb cards
Elfriede (Tom): Maybe in a month or two
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina's still mad at him but they get fake married ~~like ethan~~ so he doesn't have to get married
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah!
Elfriede (Tom): ~~he fake marries someone else~~ **crushing**
Elfriede (Tom): He fake marries like... The house maid
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina: "I can't believe you fake married Eliran"
Aldus (Jess): eliran
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Aldus (Jess): afinas like "well shit"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede: "well APPARENTLY I can't marry the girl I ACTUALLY LIKE cause I'm part DOG G O S H"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Elfriede would be a bridezilla, canon
Aldus (Jess): YEA
Elfriede (Tom): Need a picture of Elfriede in a wedding dress
Aldus (Jess): YAAAAAAAS
Aldus (Jess): "these table cloths are periwinkle, i specifically asked for SLATE BLUE"
"you cant expect me to hold a white rose bouquet, CALA LILLIES ONLY"
Elfriede (Tom): OMG YESSSS
Afina (Georgia🍀): Some kid in this class smells B A D
