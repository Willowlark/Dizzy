Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yo my Brain has been racing all night
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Maybe too much sugar
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sugaaaa
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): balance out the sugar with water to make sugar water
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Our power went out again because of the microwave <:rip:369476083248267274>
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): I think it trips the circuit when we cook for over 2 minutes
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no ğŸ˜­
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is the circuit overloaded?
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): And the box is outside <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do you have the swicth kind of curcuit breakers or the old fashioned fuses?
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): I donâ€™t know Iâ€™ve never seen it. I think switches
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Itâ€™s in a room on the back of the house thatâ€™s only accessible by going outside and that room is blocked off by boxes and shelves
Aldus Larian (Jess): Probably our house is old AF so we have fuses that need to be replaced each time
Aldus Larian (Jess): Can you move the microwave to another room so it's on a less overloaded curcuit?
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): There is no other room <:pew:543202259085950996>
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Except the bathroom
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo everything on one circuit?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or just no room?
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): No yeah we donâ€™t have any other rooms
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Thereâ€™s the first floor, second floor, and third floor
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Third floor has a low ceiling you gotta crouch and itâ€™s half the size of the other floors
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea you told me that that's right
Aldus Larian (Jess): Skinny housey
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Itâ€™s a mess hereâ€™s the first floor <:lenny:395307171539189760>
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): The entirety of it, Iâ€™m standing against the wall. The chair is to prevent that cabinet from falling over which has happened several times
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo nooo ğŸ˜­
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Powers on <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yay!
Aldus Larian (Jess): You technically only have 1 bedroom right?
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): We technically donâ€™t have any bedrooms, but we have some shelves up on the second floor that divides the room
