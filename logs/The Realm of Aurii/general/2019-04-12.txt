Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yo my Brain has been racing all night
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Maybe too much sugar
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sugaaaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): balance out the sugar with water to make sugar water
N🆗ri (Marisa): Our power went out again because of the microwave <:rip:369476083248267274>
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think it trips the circuit when we cook for over 2 minutes
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is the circuit overloaded?
N🆗ri (Marisa): And the box is outside <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do you have the swicth kind of curcuit breakers or the old fashioned fuses?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t know I’ve never seen it. I think switches
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s in a room on the back of the house that’s only accessible by going outside and that room is blocked off by boxes and shelves
Aldus Larian (Jess): Probably our house is old AF so we have fuses that need to be replaced each time
Aldus Larian (Jess): Can you move the microwave to another room so it's on a less overloaded curcuit?
N🆗ri (Marisa): There is no other room <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Except the bathroom
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo everything on one circuit?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or just no room?
N🆗ri (Marisa): No yeah we don’t have any other rooms
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s the first floor, second floor, and third floor
N🆗ri (Marisa): Third floor has a low ceiling you gotta crouch and it’s half the size of the other floors
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea you told me that that's right
Aldus Larian (Jess): Skinny housey
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a mess here’s the first floor <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): The entirety of it, I’m standing against the wall. The chair is to prevent that cabinet from falling over which has happened several times
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo nooo 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): Powers on <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yay!
Aldus Larian (Jess): You technically only have 1 bedroom right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): We technically don’t have any bedrooms, but we have some shelves up on the second floor that divides the room
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee

Bill: I wanted to write a code to interact with reacts, but I need to completely update the API library and that's a ton of workkkkk
Bill: maaaaan I did a rewrite of Dizzy like, a month ago.
Bill: I dunt wanna do it again.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Then. Don't.
Bill: But I gotta to update to get new api acess.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why tho
Bill: Basically all the ways dizzy actually talks to discord have changed.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh shit I just saw Geoff's Gazebo post and just realized he whited his beard and added contacts this year. I don't think he did that last year?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeee he added more lace too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Why he hasn't gone viral with that within the Katsu community is beyond me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's so fucking clever and looks amazing
Aldus Larian (Jess): Right?!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah thTs crazy
Bill: I actually slept til 9.
Bill: Nice.
Bill: Haven’t gotten a lot of sleep this week.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): At least if I never get a job anywhere, I can still get 1,400 likes on a Yang photo
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): For real why did Yang of all things blow up
Bill: You'll get a job.
Bill: You look amazing as Yang.
Bill: I don't think it's even a great picture of you, and you look good.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because Yang is best girl
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I thought having the light source behind the person in the photo was supposed to kill it
Bill: It did.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but yeah you weren't kidding when you said it blew up holy shit
Bill: I also hate the lens he used. Too wide angle, you look kinda fisheye.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I got like 20 new followers since posting that Yang pic
Bill: You look so compressed in that picture man.
Bill: Also, I thought you posted Nier already.
Bill: Don't see any on your feed.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I posted the one with Jess but I didn’t like how it looked when it was on my profile
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was like my tit and jess’ face
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: But also understandable.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Surprise electromagnetism
Bill: Cause they're androids get it <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: I want lunch but I don't want to *make* lunch.

Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: But actually want food, I've been snacking most of the morning.
Aldus Larian (Jess): cheese can be a meal if u eat enough of it
Bill: oof and that'll go *right* through me.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cheese cleanse
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you don't want to make anything just eat the components
Bill: *raw egg yum*
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah there you go people do that in japan
N🆗ri (Marisa): protein
N🆗ri (Marisa): did you have coffee? why didn't you put your raw egg in the hot coffee to cook like a normal rushed businessman
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i bet jaehee would try that~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): how are u supposed to get the egg out
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo maybe if u wait until the coffee finished
N🆗ri (Marisa): burn yourself
Bill: What. else did I do yesterday.
Bill: I don't remember.
Bill: I really hate the layout of my desk.
Bill: Too cluttered, and the hutch makes it feel so... tight?
Bill: I need to get rid of the hutch, cause limits where I can put monitors and that's annoying.
Bill: But I *literally* need every ounce of space it gives me cause *I have too much shit for a bedroom now*.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Katus moving out soon
Aldus Larian (Jess): 2 bedroom
Bill: This Sunday actually, and parents want it as a guest room.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Rip
Bill: Her room smaller than mine too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Two room bigger than one
Aldus Larian (Jess): My brother had 2 rooms
Aldus Larian (Jess): I could have but I found it inconvenient
Bill: I would too tbh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I had like half the basement at one point
Bill: I'd replace the desk, even if the hutch space wasn't an issue... but I don't want to have to build a new desk here and move it out sometime in the next year.
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I moved to a slightly smaller room so that I wouldn't have to listen to my parents having sex 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): Does it have doors?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or like does the top come off?
Bill: Does what?
Bill: The hutch?
Bill: Crap pano cause I don’t want to get up.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Sometime desks like that have it so the top can be taken off
Bill: Yeah, the hutch does detach.
Bill: But I need to replace the space I get from the shelf and two cabinets.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Posters
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unless you mean you need a place to out the stuff that's in the cabinets
Bill: lol the latter
N🆗ri (Marisa): i thought that silent voice poster was a hidden yona and i flipped out for a moment
Bill: mahaha.
Bill: I could... box up manga till I have my own place.
Bill: Almost thought they didn’t have them.
Bill: Am I about to spend 15 bucks on rock candy I’m not going to eat?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea
Bill: You know it.
Bill: Yo I put on a XL shirt over my t shirt for the luls and. It.
Bill: I think fit?
Bill: Which is like. Wow? *Wow?*
Bill: I wanna buy it just to confirm at home but also it’s NASA so I’d be a total copy cat if I wore it.
Bill: Oh dust was on sale nice.
Bill: Yo I can. Shop in a store? What?
N🆗ri (Marisa): sounds fake but ok
Bill: I haven’t been in a size stores carry in a Long time.  I always ordered online for the one size about that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooo not fake then

Aldus Larian (Jess): men or women?
Bill: I’m talking about the “designer” stores. Technically AE runs big anyway but.
Bill: Like, I don’t go to hot topic and look at clothes ever, cause I’m not smol.
Bill: Not that I think could do that yet, but...
N🆗ri (Marisa): o women, so maybe they don't have mens sizes?
what counts as a designer store, armani?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think he means like mall stores?
Bill: Mall stores lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): boscovs and old navy?
Bill: But not the anchors.
Bill: Thin t shirts are still a mistake at my size but. The fact that it fits at all is fantastic.
Bill: Liiiike how the next size down does, but this used to be that.
Bill: One day gut sucking can work for me 😭
Bill: Promise I’m done now, but I guess this’ll do for Sakura Sunday. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Bill: I bought it. No worries.
Bill: Was kinda fun, but I also shouldn’t buy too much cause I’m still looking to lose a lot more weight so.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So a lot of the people they had presenting for career day are alum so apparently I'm the youngest alum here (2012) so they just had me take a picture with the oldest alum (1954)
Bill: And got the belts I’ve been meaning to buy for weeks.
