Bill: ahahahaha I put a hold on an apartment.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nicu
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just checked the apartment place I was looking at and they finally have a 1bedroom listed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so thanks for the reminder
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): price went up a little bit but fuck it
Bill: I can get it back if I cancel within 72 hours of application acceptance cause boy this was not what I expected to do this morning but the price is low for the complex and tier apartment, and I didn’t want it sold out from under me.
Bill: ~~it’s like booking con rooms before we have people committed to them~~
Bill: I’ve seen nothing else with the space for cost in our area so...
Bill: Yikes.
Bill: Wow that went way faster than I thought it would. Like, obviously putting in the application needs to be done quick when the price drops just. I dunno, I didn't think it'd be a con booking esk rapid fire.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): APPLIED
Aldus Larian (Jess): first of the month fam they want people IN
Bill: true. It's more just how quickly I had to do the application.
Bill: It's not like a calculated decision it was get a lock on this before someone else does and think about it later.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): earliest move-in date for mine was the Sunday of CCE so I put my preferred date as the next Saturday. Happy birthday to me ❤
Bill: yo you're going to suffer if you move in after CCE.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea they dont want you to overthink it
Bill: You'll still be recouping lol
Bill: Well, I can still cancel, and now that the rate is locked even if I decide to slowly transition to the apartment (cause my weekends are busy in august) I can, s'long as I pick up the keys.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That was just the first available date. I put down the 21st
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nice guys!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I wonder if you get random searched alot cuz your last name sounds russian 🤔 <@301927856240459777>
Nokri (Marisa): oooooo <:thinku:543194478614413318> 
that would make sense at airports, but the smithsonians didn't look at ID or names or anything
Bill: it's cause she cute. <:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): True, clearly dangerous
Nokri (Marisa): no u
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The mystery continues
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wheezes I’m thinking of aurii for too long
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I went “nokri doesn’t sound Russian”
El🆓de Faun (Tom): (I actually think that sounds russian too lmao)
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nokri Demitri
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Nokri Demetri Ditkoff
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
El🆓de Faun (Tom): If that is your real name
Bill: Oh ho there's talk of moving my office to jersey city/ hoboken.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nice
El🆓de Faun (Tom): OHOHOH
Bill: It's not really any closer for me tho, and then I can't say I work in NYC.
Bill: We all like the place we rent from here too, so...
Bill: It's a toss up.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok. not nice then i guess
Bill: We'll see what happens with it.
Bill: It's interesting.
Bill: It'd be a tax break.
Bill: Also interesting, I *think* I saw Jing working on a resume when I left for lunch. 👀
Bill: I hope she's not going to leave (though she's on the project I used to be on and they can make you want to kill yourself) cause she my favorite of the data science team.
Bill: Definitely need to hijack some velcro from someone.
Bill: I forgot when I came to make the Kaminari thing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): u can buy it for 1.75 a foot at the hallmark in sparta
Bill: All I need is enough for to attach this to the back of the switch tho.
Bill: Well. 1.75 is cheap. I’m never in Sparta, but Micheal’s probably has it too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye
Bill: They don’t want to let me view the apartment until close to move in date, but I lose my deposit in 72 hours after approval.
Bill: I want to see the place damnit.
Bill: The first time I see it should not be when I move in.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): can't you schedule a tour?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I thought that was typically the procedure was find a place, inquire and ask for a tour, go on tour and get info, when unit becomes available apply
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea ussually it is? i wouldnt sign a contract site-unseen
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): me neither
Bill: They have model apartment they show you.
Bill: They’re trying to say that’s enough.
Bill: Which I’m not a fan of.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): are they mostly set up the same?
Bill: They are, but the trim levels vary.
Bill: So I won’t know if it’s carpeted, hardwood, cabinets, anything.
Aldus Larian (Jess): D:!
Bill: I’ll know what SHOULD be there but I’m not a fan of committing to rent for a year without knowing for the exact unit.
Bill: And I’d lose my hold deposit if I wait till they LET me see the place.
Bill: (And don’t take it)
Bill: https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/education/college/2019/07/30/middlesex-county-college-offers-free-tuition-eligible-students/1866262001/
Aldus Larian (Jess): biru are u calling my work?some guy is on the phone that "works for a contractor of IBM"
Bill: No?
Bill: Though that's amusing.
Bill: You need data analytics? I get *bank* if I bring in a new client to Indellient.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah he wants to take the program
Bill: I can't actually find the documentation about that.
Bill: Shame.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good news, I think I secured my apartment
Bad news, it's a second floor unit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:pew:543202259085950996>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Why is that bad?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Moving furniture
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Ooof yeah
Kaio Vermino (Lee): The moving part is bad but not hearing people above you is so satisfying that it's worth it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think it's 3 floors though
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oof
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Nvm
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I think he said there's like a foot of concrete between each floor
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So it's not entirely sound proof, but should at least be relatively quiet
Kaio Vermino (Lee): At least ita not the 3rd floor for moving furniture then <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ayyyye <:pew:543202259085950996>
