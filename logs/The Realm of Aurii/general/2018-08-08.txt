Afina (Georgia🍀): im watching an astrology documentary and it says how even though horoscopes arent rooted in science, theyre good for people
Afina (Georgia🍀): because the barnum effect means that people want to believe them
Afina (Georgia🍀): and they usually give generic positive advice like "focus on the bigger picture" or "let go of negative emotions"
Bill: I have fun with the Leo stereotypes.
Bill: I do fit a lot of them.
Bill: Generalities sure, but it’s fun to play into.
Bill: It’s like tropes.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah
Afina (Georgia🍀): and it says that people that believe them
Afina (Georgia🍀): or at least have a little faith in them
Afina (Georgia🍀): have a new source of spirituality thats very focused on positive outcomes
Bill: I mean, not all horoscopes are positive right?
Bill: I don’t check them.
Afina (Georgia🍀): they mostly are
Afina (Georgia🍀): its like "Be careful cause darkness is ahead but be positive"
Bill: Ha. I guess I focus on the negative. 😅
Eliran (Halim): Even the negative horoscopes usually come with a slice of advice
Bill: Well they’re all advice.
Eliran (Halim): Like "this month is gonna be hard relation ships in the work place, so maybe try and focus on being cordial and take your time with people"
Aldus (Jess): Lmfao what kinda horoscope is this; AUG 8, 2018: You give a whole new meaning to the term 'fresh idea.' Your idea is so fresh it's as if it never even heard of a refrigerator. Your idea is so fresh it's like the refrigerator was never even invented. It's so fresh it still smells like the warm earth you plucked it out of. It's so fresh it lets off a little spray of juice when you bite into it. It's so fresh -- well, you get the idea. Put it into action before it gets stale.
Afina (Georgia🍀): lmao wut
Bill: How fresh.
