Afina (Georgia🍀): I just wanted ice cream on my way back from school cries

Aldus (Jess): Don't forget to do the thing Billy
Bill: On it now, TANKS.
Aldus (Jess): No prob
Nokri (Marisa): Biru am I your one tumblr follower
Nokri (Marisa): *unfollows*
Nokri (Marisa): my abandoned side tumblr has over 2000 followers and my abandoned youtube channel from 10 years ago has 99 subscribers and 8k+ views per video so i've learned that to be famous you have to abandon everything and never use social media
Elfriede (Tom): *was that that channel you shared one video from before on here**
Nokri (Marisa): 🤔 did I? I don't think so
Nokri (Marisa): it's mostly bad amvs
maybe that one kotoricon vid? maybe
Elfriede (Tom): yeah..... maybeee
Elfriede (Tom): i cant remember
Elfriede (Tom): i think it was just a mascerade from some con
Nokri (Marisa): oooooooo naw that would've been from the convention's official youtube
Nokri (Marisa): or deuce's channel
Elfriede (Tom): ahhh yeee you prob right 👌
Bill: Angel Beats is doing better than I thought.
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i've seen biru fight navy seals he is a killing machine
Bill: Weren’t you in B anyway.
Nokri (Marisa): naw i know your horrendous bloodthirsty past
Bill: You right. I have the body of a hardened war hero.
Nokri (Marisa): ever wonder why there are never any corpses around biru?
he disposes of them.
Nokri (Marisa): oof i haven't ironed clothes as i was wearing them for a while. sure does burn.
Bill: Chalk me up for the dream patrol.
Bill: Georgia had a birthday party at basically a big con room like the Zenkai formal room, but it was setup for roller skating. It was kinda cosplay too, Tom and Jess were Nier but Georgia was casual Pyrrha minus the wig, for whatever reason. Room was cool and had all sorts of glowy accent lights and stuff. I had a pair of old roller skates with no foot brake I could barely use so I was wrecking balling it up. Something didn’t go right, can’t remember, but there was a big dopey group hug for Georgia when that bothered her. Also saw Lulu, who when she saw me across a room mouthed “shit” which I then immediately went to laugh shot with Tom and Jess.
Nokri (Marisa): “Georgia was casual Pyrrha minus the wig”
Ah so Pyrrha was cosplaying Georgia
Eliran (Halim): So Georgia was actually meg
Nokri (Marisa): I understand that reference
Bill: Help I have West Virginia stuck in my head.
Nokri (Marisa): it's wonderful Bethesda dubbed that song into english from its original japanese
Bill: ah yes, west virginia, Japan.
Nokri (Marisa): yeah I wonder how they got permission from Ghibli to use it
Aldus (Jess): i thought my boss wasnt here but her his whomp
Bill: What's a boss?
Nokri (Marisa): it's like a really hard, special enemy
Bill: 
Nokri (Marisa): i bet the first person to invent blankets was really rad
Elfriede (Tom): I'm sure they were
Bill: good luck on the exam <@!245270932602486784>.
Afina (Georgia🍀): THANK
Bill: * TANK
Bill: I got the 1300 (newest model) printer back from the repair shop, because the 1200 isn't repaired anymore.
Bill: so far, much less finicky.
Eliran (Halim): I decided to go biking and enjoy the so called great outdoods
Eliran (Halim): And mother nature decided it wanted to burn my skin
Eliran (Halim): This is why you should stay inside kids
Aldus (Jess): ~~probably not the best day for that~~
Eliran (Halim): Do you ever realize how much sun your arms get while biking
Eliran (Halim): Its a lot
Eliran (Halim): Like I completely forgot they got so much sun 
I was mainly worried about my leggies
Aldus (Jess): did you wear the sunblock? 😮
Eliran (Halim): I stupidly thought that most of my trip was in the shade and said a proverbial fuck it
Eliran (Halim): I've never gotten sunburn biking before
Eliran (Halim): I even put sunscreen in my bag cause I knew I planned on locking my bike when I got to mainstreet and walking instead
Eliran (Halim): So I was like "this will be good for then"
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: rip it still gets stuck after a half dozen prints.
Aldus (Jess): i want coffee but my coworkers who gags at the smell of coffee is in the lunch room
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oof that midterm sucked but no one else looked like they knew what they were doing so I think we all failed together
Bill: such is upper level math.
Bill: Do your best, trust in the curve.
Afina (Georgia🍀): honestly its 100% faith in the curve with the last text
Afina (Georgia🍀): but like, its weird cause i got an A on the first midterm
Afina (Georgia🍀): maybe she upped the difficulty cause everyone did too well, the average was like an 81
Afina (Georgia🍀): she also put out a pretty shitty review for this one, the last one was way more comprehensive
Bill: probably the latter.
Afina (Georgia🍀): o well time to drown my sorrows in a good burrito
Bill: Well, don't stress it. You did your best, and can't do more than that.
Afina (Georgia🍀): yeah and she said no matter what your other grades are, if you get an A on the final its an A in the class
Afina (Georgia🍀): SO im already ahead of the curse with my midterm 1 A
Bill: what the fuck kind of grading is *that*.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I dunno
Aldus (Jess): Coming to the park when it's above 90 mean I get the entire park to myself <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): Omg there is a man running, he gonna die
Bill: Maybe I should drive slower. It’s supposed to be 15 minutes to rockaway, not 10.
Bill: This might be a crowded movie.
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> <@!228287793099440128> I went in, I’m full of shit it’s not crowded. Odds are there’ll be no previews tho. Also can use the electronic ticket things if you prebought.
