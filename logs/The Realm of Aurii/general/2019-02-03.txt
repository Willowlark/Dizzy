Bill: Football thing: the giants have denied the patriots the super bowl twice as underdogs. Giants fans don’t like the patriots and vice versa. 
My family is all Giants fans. 
Our friends are giants fans. Cept Mr Braun is now not rooting against the patriots because her daughters boyfriend likes the patriots.
Bill: Traitor.
