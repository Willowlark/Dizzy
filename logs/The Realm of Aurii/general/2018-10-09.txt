Nok nok who's there (Marisa): who's ready
Nok nok who's there (Marisa): o this fall's election is big because it could get trump out of the white house
Nok nok who's there (Marisa): who's ready for some political revolution
Afina (Georgia): could it really
Afina (Georgia): is it already the presidential election
Afina (Georgia): it cant be, its only been 2 years
Nok nok who's there (Marisa): this election determines who'll be sitting in the house and the senate
trump is still in office because the house and the senate are currently dominated by republications who support him
(currently the senate has 51 rep / 49 dems, house has 238 reps / 197 dems)

the house of reps can start the impeachment process and then the senate has to agree with them for a trial to start. if 2/3 of senators hate the president then he'll be kicked out of office in the middle of his term
Afina (Georgia): ooooh for impeachment purposes not re-election purposes
Afina (Georgia): gotcha
Elfriede (Tom): **i know nothing about all the candidates aghhh**
Elfriede (Tom): as usualy
Nok nok who's there (Marisa): discord doesn't have a donkey emoji only an elephant emoji **this is political corruption**
Nok nok who's there (Marisa): imagine a political discord with just a ton of politics themed emojis
Aldus (Jess): üò≠
Nok nok who's there (Marisa): it would have stuff like the obama "then perish" and reaction pics of random politicians
Elfriede (Tom): that sounds like a terrible world
Elfriede (Tom): minus the obama one, we can add that
Elfriede (Tom): :3
Bill: Kinda wanna try a BNHA oneshot.
Bill: BESM or Mutants and Masterminds could run the campaign world easily.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): Let‚Äôs do it lets go
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): Isn‚Äôt BESM an adult thing though
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): A BNHA character whose quirk is to just be a WiFi hotspot
Bill: That‚Äôs bdsm, and I heard that a lot in middle school yes.
Bill: I‚Äôve wanted to run a besm canpaign since I was 12, BNHA is probably the first game where the system matches the setting.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): Original joke do not steal. What is that acronym.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): Is it a book
Bill: Big eyes small mouth. Anime role playing game system.
Bill: I just realized a plot hole in the movie.
Bill: The island doesn‚Äôt have quirk restrictions.
Bill: They used their quirks legally.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): Let‚Äôs! Anime role play. Like middle schoolers let‚Äôs go.
Bill: For the record I‚Äôm talking a live game, not pbp.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): LARP?
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): Or like dnd style
Bill: Ye.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): Everybody sits around the table going ‚Äúpew pew pew‚Äù
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): someone with a wifi hotspot quirk would be so popular while someone with a tech nullification quirk would probably be institutionalized if they can't control it. sad!
Bill: *how do I not have a pdf of the 2nd edition*
Bill: *how*
Bill: *I must*
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): if i was a bnha character i'd be the one guy who makes people's eyebrows grow uncontrollably all the time
Elfriede (Tom): Buy can they tell what thier WiFi is being used for and how many devices?
Elfriede (Tom): Can they password protect their eifi
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): maybe it gives them a headache if a lot of people use it, like how uraraka would throw up when she used her quirk
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): password protect by leveling up the quirk <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): It oke she throw up rainbows
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): omg i saw the best dangan ronpa comic where did it go
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): has anyone here seen or played dangan ronpa. like, just the first two episodes or the first trial of the game
Elfriede (Tom): I ... Ownit!
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): i don't want to spoil the first bit sghgfad have you played it <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): *come back when you're played past the first class trial*
Bill: Oh this is going to piss me off so much.
Elfriede (Tom): Oh I just realized I can bring my cat.ear headphones to work and watch anime in the back room when testing cable
Elfriede (Tom): Shit I'm a fool
Aldus (Jess): D:
Aldus (Jess): you cant watch anime wifout me! üò≠
Elfriede (Tom): Yes I can I already am <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aldus (Jess): ~~you cant watch anything i wanna see tho~~
Elfriede (Tom): ~~watchme~~
Aldus (Jess): i was alone for 3 days!
Aldus (Jess): üò¶
Elfriede (Tom): I'm alone every day at work!
Aldus (Jess): plus id rewatch it in  min
Aldus (Jess): no you're not
Afina (Georgia): youre not alone <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao I'm just messing anyways,I wouldn't watch anything I'd think you'd like
Aldus (Jess): o tay üò≠
Bill: Wow. Did Tom just straight up deny Ash and Dave exist?
Elfriede (Tom): Dave's dead
Bill: Technically, but the phylactery keeps him basically fine.
Elfriede (Tom): He's pretty much an imortal lich at this point
Elfriede (Tom): He just needs to figure out how to transfer his phylactery to his body and he'll be set
Bill: Technically Dave is a magical girl then.
Bill: Got a new pdf of BESM 2e.
Bill: Whew.
Bill: all better.
Dave: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): dave-chan aahh
Dave: ÂèØÊÑõ„ÅÑ
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): Ooo i could cosplay natsumi during one of my shifts at zenkai, i was making lifesize versions of the kerons from sgt frog that I could wrap around my arm and leg to make my character easier to identify. natsumi wears a ton of different and simple outfits.
i did chise 2 years ago and one person recognize me wooo (before the anime was announced)
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): i wouldn't even need to do anything for that since i was planning on cosplaying her anyway. i have literally everything needed. woo.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): 1 day planned. 3 days to go.
Aldus (Jess): WHOOO
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): remember when k-on was everything. wow.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): OH YEAH i was considering doing witch yuki for halloween (like she's dressed in episode 0 of haruhi) but. i have remilia. duh. that'll work fine.
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): wow. so it's really good everyone started messaging Kiwi. she's the head of the security team and apparently even though I got an e-mail that they sent my application to security, Kiwi said she didn't get it and is going to personally request it. So first cosplay never got my application and then security never got it. rude. whoever is running staff services is my enemy.
Aldus (Jess): hi im jess and i like to read extremely sad stories on facebook and cry at my desk
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): share! share! share!

Nokia 3310 (Marisa): people who like watching or reading about sad things will feel happier about their own life afterwards and have a stronger bond/respect for what they have
Nokia 3310 (Marisa): jess is growing strong

Aldus (Jess): omg i am so sad right now

Bill: You know what bugs me? When people be speaking chinese at IBM. Namely Jing.
Bill: I always feel like I'm being gossiped about.
Bill: Not that Jing is the type to gossip, but cause she my coworker I care more than if the IBM people are talking.
Bill: Makes me glad I got the noise cancelling headphones.
Bill: Shit I‚Äôm tired.
Bill: Like zoning out driving tired.
Bill: Traffic and sleepy eyes. Great combo.
Bill: Oh *Yay*
Bill: The person in charge of my side project (the one that's been a crapshoot the last few days) gave notice!
Bill: ~~I'm pretty much the only one who knows about the project iirc~~
