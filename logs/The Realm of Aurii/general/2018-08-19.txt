Elfriede (Tom): Lmao damn
Nokri (Marisa): I almost choked at work because “I think the emotion on this cat’s face is democratic engagement” is really funny
Nokri (Marisa): Some dude just got on the train to rub his leg against me and when I moved he got off the train wth
Nokri (Marisa): I should’ve said something frick
Nokri (Marisa): I’m pretty sure every single person noticed
Nokri (Marisa): I’m gonna get off an see if I can tell a station attendant in case he’s still there
Nokri (Marisa): The police station girls were very nice. One gave me tissues and the other walked me back to my train. 

Thus proving that people are more willing to violate people outside of cosplay than in cosplay. Yesterday I had a guy like 10 feet away ask if he could come closer while I was cosplaying and when I said sure he stood like 9 feet away.
Bill: Glad you reported him.
Bill: I don’t care if it’s cosplay or not, no one should be harassing you.
Nokri (Marisa): Straight up molestation. Guy had an MO.
Nokri (Marisa): High school forensics training kicks in
Nokri (Marisa): Time to go sort through trash like a raccoon
Afina (Georgia🍀): What a weirdo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Glad you're safely away from him now
Afina (Georgia🍀): 💕
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH like a train with a ton of empty spaces and he sits right next to me and crushes me against the wall and rubs his leg on me. i regret not stepping on his foot. The police officers were literally like "next time, it's totally ok to grab and twist his arm while loudly asking for assistance."
they asked me if i wanted to sue the guy if they found him lol
Afina (Georgia🍀): GROSS yeah next time kick him :>
Bill: What kind of weirdo wants to rub legs anyway. That’s like foot fetish weird. 

You cut a bitch if anyone tries anything. Lit, with a knife.
Bill: Japan considers train molesting on par with murder so it’ll be called self defense AND everyone in Japan loves Yandere.
Bill: Alternatively, come homeeeeee
Nokri (Marisa): i didn't have my scissors or needles, omiya's LS is super small and there's no room in the break area for my junk so while I'm usually fully armed while going to kitasenju, i only bring a teeny tiny bag i can hide at my desk to omiya.

yeah omg the poor officers were like "this happens ALL the time. especially in summer because shorts and skirts" and at that moment I thanked kami-sama i wore long pants today
Nokri (Marisa): i do wish to return to my hermit lifestyle, if i never leave the house outside of conventions it drastically reduces the chances of this occurring
Bill: That’s not going to happen tho cause you have a bunch of friends who want to see you over here. Yes, outside of cons.
Nokri (Marisa): but........... people don't interact outside of cons? what do people do outside of cons?
Nokri (Marisa): OH anime clubs right
Nokri (Marisa): and gamestop on release days
Bill: ~~Mostly play excessive amounts of jackbox~~
Nokri (Marisa): jackbox can be done from in solitude <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: No, we go to anime movies, and pretend we’re cool kids who hang out at malls, and get dinner, talk about cosplay, play video games....
Nokri (Marisa): HOLY FUDGE I HAD A DUDE CALL ME OUT FOR COSPLAYING AT WORK TODAY
Bill: I swear I will never let you get away with that.
Nokri (Marisa): DID I MENTION THAT HERE. I MENTIONED IT SOMEWHERE.
Nokri (Marisa): get away with wat
Bill: The jackbox thing.
Bill: You didn’t.
Nokri (Marisa): my second client today was this guy, Adam (slokavian coworker) warned me about him because he had him yesterday and was like "heads up your 10:45 is a total weeb"
so he comes for his lesson and starts talking. typically avoids mentioned anime because shame, so i offhandedly go "oh sometimes i watch anime" and that got it rolling, he didn't use the textbook he just talked about anime.
and like 4 minutes into the lesson he goes "do you cosplay" and i was like <:lenny:395307171539189760> "nnnnnnnyeahhh.."
Nokri (Marisa): i brought up a google search of otakon and he was SO confused by one picture because in japan cosplay is srs business
Nokri (Marisa): he could not understand This
Bill: WELCOME TO AMERICA SON
Nokri (Marisa): he like "why...??? why stockings??? why is he dressed like that" and i was like "it fun."
Bill: Ngl Japanese Cosplay sounds terrible.
Nokri (Marisa): it's ok. has its ups and downs, both sides have good points and bad points
Nokri (Marisa): well, the US doesn't really have many bad points but I think there's a lot more drama
Bill: Only with certain famous people.
Nokri (Marisa): u ever dying of starvation but too lazy to walk .2 feet to get food
Bill: yo I just started reorganizing my con badge board; why it Katsu's so fucking huge?
Nokri (Marisa): is this year's otakon badge the same size or any bigger than katsu's? 🤔 or is it smaller
Bill: Nope. ANYC has a big one too.
Nokri (Marisa): hmm. that rules out the "it's close to DC so security purposes" idea
Nokri (Marisa): when you bought day-of tickets did you have to fill out forms?
Nokri (Marisa): otakon
Nokri (Marisa): or maybe its a venue thing
Elfriede (Tom): Ooof that SUCKS, sorry that train thing happened
Aldus (Jess): SUE HIS ASS
Bill: My eyes are tired but I want to work on more photos.
Bill: I have a Saber Lily print that doesn't quite fit in it's 12x18 frame and *nothing* else in that size.
Bill: Meanwhile I have half a dozen 13x19 prints I really should get a frame for.
Elfriede (Tom): I know dat feel
