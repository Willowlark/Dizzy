Aldus (Jess): Going to sleep
Nokri (Marisa): good after party idea
Elfriede (Tom): More wierd dreams mah dudes
Elfriede (Tom): I was outside near my cars (in the city? But it was an outside parking lot) and we saw a huge storm with a ton of lightning coming. Eventually it hit and a tornado came by so I held our car in place with my awesome strength ofc. But my other car slid into our car damaging it. So we went to the hospital to file an insurance report.???? But Jess came too to tell them about the fact that she's sick too. We spent what felt like hours running around this skyscraper resort through cosplayers looking for the doctors section. Jess got checked out when we finally found it but they said they couldn't file the insurance report cuz doctors don't do that (surprise). 
What a stressful dream holy shit.
Elfriede (Tom): I think we eventually tried to move the car into a parking garage but I got.lost in the garage cuz the top floor is a food court you need to drive through. (I remember being in this same parking garage withe the food court in other dreams)
Nokri (Marisa): is jess ok
