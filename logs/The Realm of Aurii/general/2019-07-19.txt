Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah it was supposed a.grid issue but they fixed it super fast 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): They were about to send us home
Nokri (Marisa): curses!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): One time at work, on a Friday when our production leaves at 11 anyway mind you, we lost power at the very beginning of the day. My boss called me while I was on my way to let me know he was going to probably be sending people home, so I exited the highway and started turning around, then he told me to come in anyway so I had to get back on the highway to go in. When I got there, there was no power and the power company wasn't sure when it would be back on so since they can't really do much without electricity, he sent everyone home. Everyone *except* me and another guy because he wanted us to work on a big assembly... by lamp light... plugged into a spare UPS... I was a *little* pissed because I wanted to go home too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then 20 minutes after everyone left, the power came back
Aldus Larian (Jess): UGH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so he started calling people to let them know if they wanted to come back to make up the hours
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thats so bad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not many did lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ughhhh

Nokri (Marisa): We’ve been looking for our iron for weeks. Finally just used an old iron this morning. Found the regular iron right after using the old one. <:thinku:543194478614413318> 

The old iron is pretty cool though it’s at least 50 years old and looks like it’ll electrocute me
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa
Nokri (Marisa): Thin
Nokri (Marisa): That green and yellow thread-lookin thing behind it is the cord to plug it in
