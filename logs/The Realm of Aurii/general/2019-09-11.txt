Aldus Larian (Jess): Whomst
Aldus Larian (Jess): Were just gonna try to avoid whatever that is
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Yo I have no idea but I'm uncomfortable lmao
Bill: Stick with the fam and you’ll be fine~~
Nokri (Marisa): im gonna see everyone saturday evening and that's probably it haha rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wat?! Nuuu I miss you!
Nokri (Marisa): no u!
Glonk: Only one day?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof catch me not dreaming about alligators ever again
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *good luck with that in Florida*
Bill: Awhile back I was walking through bed bath and beyond and I happened on a section for shaving stuff and a brand called 'every man jack'. I picked up an 'after shave lotion' kinda thing and liked it and now I keep picking up stuff, like a charcoal face scrub for acne and my shampoo's from them and I'm wondering how much more stuff they have cause I enjoy the products and I think they work pretty well
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Holy baloney my mentor gave me some insider info today
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was one out of over 100 applications
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s a less than 1% chance of getting selected
Bill: I started listening to a podcast from lifehacker and they're doing an ad for somethin and one said "you won't have to ask a developer for help" and then in unison they said "ugh, developers" and I'm *offended*
Bill: I did it without destroying it this time!
Bill: I had the last of the leftover pizza in my freezer for lunch and I’ve been braindead food coma ever since =/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I tried doing a sudoku to get my brain going again but I got very stuck and been working on it for like an hour
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is what I got. I left the center ones blank because basically any number can go in them
El🆓de Faun (Tom): I'll solve the shit outta this when I get back from break
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): never mind I got it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): guess I just need to bitch about it and then my brain is like *"ok, now try this"*
Bill: What are the odds ice cream on the way back from the doctor will energize me
Tikur (Kurtis): Don't do it
Aldus Larian (Jess): none
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 0%
Aldus Larian (Jess): get a coffee fam
Aldus Larian (Jess): *takes own advice*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): save unnecessary sugar intake for fruity drinks at CCE <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Damn, impulse control strikes again 😂
Bill: Coffee good too. I get Bucks
Bill: Question. I have a component in my code I refer to as a capsule, ala gatcha capsules. The components all do a single data cleaning step. I called the capsules cause I was working off the mental image of opening a series of capsules and your file is clean. 

It’s not a great analogy tho, got any better one?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://media1.tenor.com/images/d66eff9df8091aca0f18469caad28673/tenor.gif?itemid=6131625
Aldus Larian (Jess): yaaaa i have no idea what you're talking about
Bill: Mmm that’s why I’m trying to come up with a better explanation 😭
Nokri (Marisa): dominoes
Nokri (Marisa): butterflies
Aldus Larian (Jess): tide pods
Aldus Larian (Jess): they clean
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): When I think of "capsules" I think if a time capsule or a pill
Bill: Dominos huh. That miiiiight work
Nokri (Marisa): it sounds like it's a part of the code that, when executed, triggers a chain reaction? and each step in that reaction does one part of the cleaning for whatever file they're working on?
Nokri (Marisa): cinderellas
Bill: So it's more like building blocks, where each block does one thing do the data. Simple stuff, like replacing X with Y. Which alone is really straight forward, but by combining a bunch of them it fully automates cleaning for given input file.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *legos*
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~I dont even understand what "cleaning" means~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or "controls" maybe? In engineering when you want to automate a system, you add various controls that get triggered to run something
Bill: You don't really have to, just take as a step taken on file It's a lot simpler than you'd think though 😂
Bill: Controls are more individual, these are more like a single control that can have any number of sub controls.

Nokri (Marisa): 
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Within 3-5 minutes
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Fast
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Machete only run
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Hardcore
Nokri (Marisa): I’m torn between “wow it’s almost 8” and “it’s only almost 8?”
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That question determines your gender
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Choose wisely
