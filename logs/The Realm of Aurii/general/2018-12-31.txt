Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): It okay!
Bill: There is DUST in my GODAMN VIEWFINDER, **AGAIN** and I hate it.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Did you try turning it off and on again
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): The nerds here today absolutely reek. Sometimes I get squished and it smelled horrible and I want to leave and come back later after taking cosplay pics but I know the vendors will have packed up by then
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’ve only been able to get my kouhai’s book so far today
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Wait. Isn't it Monday?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Comiket goes till Monday?
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Last three days of the year <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> cuz it’s a holiday
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Everyone has off today so it’s packed
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): And smelly
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Gonna try to get into the West y’all
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Hall
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oh damn
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Don't die
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I did a little when I saw a giant like for furry made in abyss hentai. That’s sick. Also I thought West hall had trinkets for sale but it’s all porn so I’m going back to east hall
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Photography isn’t allowed inside the halls but even if it was its too crowded to even lift my hand
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): To take a picture
Bill: Whewwww
Bill: I can manage about an hour socializing with normies.
Bill: After that it gets hard.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m alive again there’s a massive line for a book about potatoes and it gives me hope. 
That’s why you should always bring anime figures and pillows wherever you go
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): If that sounds awful
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Just like, all of that
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): The row of cookbooks is wedged in between rows of porn, as is the table about dentistry and the table about skull configuration. I got lost and jostled around a lot in the military area which was kind of frightening but now the crowd is starting to thin out juuust a bit
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ah that's where I left my cookbooks
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Oh cool here’s the line area for people who bought too much and need to mail it home. I forgot it’s cold outside.
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): 
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): 😱
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): I’m in line to use the anime ATM I can’t wait. 
Last person in line has to hold the “end of the line” sign it’s fun
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oh they don't have a person for that?
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It has to be the poor sap
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Yeah sometimes there are people for that but there are SO many lines they wouldn’t have enough volunteers. And the lines last for hours and are constantly moving so one person is usually never holding the sign for longer than a minute or two
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): They need the staff volunteers to walk the line to the booth and make sure no one cuts while the line is moving because there’s no space indoors for the line and everyone has to wait outside
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Super awful oof
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Idk when pewdiepie decided to stop trying to be filthy Frank but, his content for the past couple days has actually been pretty decent
Bill: I ordered me a brunette!
Bill: *Which is a caramel martini*
Bill: *which I totally ordered ENTIRELY for that joke*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Russian mail order brides
Bill: ~~that wouldn't even work~~
