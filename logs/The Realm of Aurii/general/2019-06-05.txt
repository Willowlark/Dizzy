N👌kri (Marisa): i spaced out and had a daydream where i was at katsucon trying to meet a delivery person and i was by the giant slide ~~(in my katsucon dreams there's a giant slide you can go down instead of waiting for the elevator)~~ but there were a lot of people, so i was on the phone saying "i'm next to hestia" and the delivery guy was like "i don't know who that is" and i was so irrationally full of rage like "how do you not know who hestia is she's the most iconic waifu of 2015" and then i snapped back to reality
N👌kri (Marisa): sorry imaginary delivery person
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao

Bill: that gave me the *weirdest* mental image and I need bleach.
Tikur (Kurtis): You said fuck the rule of thirds 😏
