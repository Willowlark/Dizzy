Tikur (Kurtis): Boar time
Aldus Larian (Jess): Inosuke is dat u
Aldus Larian (Jess): My toenails are painted so often that when they aren't painted I'm like "ew they look weird"
Nokri (Marisa): my tumblr is all just the same stuff over and over again. i'll see a post and go "oo that looks cool i wanna reblog it" and then see that they reblogged it from me
Nokri (Marisa): sometimes i'll even see myself reblog something and go to reblog it again <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have to like everything I reblog just so remember
Nokri (Marisa): ooo das smart
Nokri (Marisa): all my posts are stuff i queued up to reblog 3 months ago probably at like 4am so it's like experiencing them for the first time all over again
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA I see this as I've liked and I'm like "I have no memory of this"
Nokri (Marisa): oo this is scheduled to post tomorrow this is nice
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): time to play "i want to message someone in japanese but idk how formal to write to them"
Nokri (Marisa): do i just yolo and go for "pls be my friend i wrote u an informal message"
Nokri (Marisa): i did it. regret.
Nokri (Marisa): *i just want to fangirl over ash with tatsumi* 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): YAY FRIENDSS
Nokri (Marisa): tatsumi is so pure. so good.
Nokri (Marisa): she also draws south park yaoi she's like the ideal human being
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oh yes of course, optimal human skill
Nokri (Marisa): the sweetest girls are always the most hardcore.
tatsumin owns rabbits and likes gentle things but also draws and sells incredibly nsfw south park yaoi
nanako is the most studious and quietest girl but can outdrink everybody and still act sober like 10 shots in
Nokri (Marisa): i miss people i knew in japan but i never want to message them because the time zones are so different, and now too much time has passed <:rip:369476083248267274>
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Yeah the timezones thing is hard, can message them in the morning tho!
El🆓de Faun (Tom): When we used to message you!
Nokri (Marisa): 新しい電話買ってきた。お前は誰？
El🆓de Faun (Tom): It me
Nokri (Marisa): no this is patrick
Nokri (Marisa): it's nice the history channel is airing 102 Minutes that Changed America. i've never seen it before, it's good. we had to watch the french brother's fireman documentary footage in school but the teachers kept fastforwarding because they couldn't show people on fire or bodies
Nokri (Marisa): the country does a pretty good job at propaganda today too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I never even really saw any footage until a few years ago
Nokri (Marisa): it's morbidly fascinating. makes you think how things would be if it happened again
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My parents sheltered me from watching any of the footage of the planes crashing because I was so young.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There would be hell of a lot more footage
Nokri (Marisa): yeah that's understandable. watching this just now made me lightheaded watching some of the stuff happening
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I keep forgetting that back then you needed an actual camera to take video
Nokri (Marisa): oh man imagine what it would be like inside there.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh God
Nokri (Marisa): i wonder if there would be footage from the inside? we have videos of people dying, like those korean boys who drowned on a school trip and filmed their boat sinking, but that was a slow death. i think in the instance you're actively trying to survive there wouldn't be anyone filming unless they've already given up
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Watching the planes hit didn't affect me as much tonight as footage of people jumping to their deaths. The camera just orgasmed down on one guy falling until it was obscured by the foreground
Nokri (Marisa): yeah that's what got me
have you ever seen the french brother's documentary? if memory serves they go inside but they stay on the lower floors
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): There would probably have been footage on security cameras but it would have been destroyed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have not
Nokri (Marisa): ooh true
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think one of the clips I saw was from that documentary
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The one that's a clear shot of the first plane hitting
Nokri (Marisa): i think this is the whole documentary, not 100% sure though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJgoDYeP0Jk
Nokri (Marisa): yeah it's crazy
Nokri (Marisa): they were in new york filming a documentary on fire fighters when the people they were following around got the call, and they kept their cameras on the whole time
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wish I could remember anything from that day. I was only 7 and didn't really understand what was going on
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I do remember hearing about that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I saw another video that a film student took from her apartment with the second plane hitting and then collapsing
Nokri (Marisa): yeah our age group is kind of the first who can't quite remember that day. my mother said the school let out early and had everyone get picked up

ooooooh nooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah I think we were sent home early too. I just remember seeing the news channels covering the story for what seemed like weeks afterward, always just showing footage of the smoking buildings
Nokri (Marisa): I wonder if anything like it will happen again. Hopefully not but ya never know
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Idk. I dunno what the aerospace industry has done since then but I feel like with modern technology it would be easier to identify a plane being hijacked
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah possibly! a family friend was a stewardess who knew the flight attendants on one of the planes, she said they were boiling water and handing out cutlery for passengers to use as weapons but there wasn’t much to be done by that point.
Nokri (Marisa): They were hoping to throw boiling water on the terrorists
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jeez
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Anyway, I'm heading to bed. Goodnight 💕
Nokri (Marisa): Goodnight!! Sorry for the depressing talk, sleep well and have good dreams!!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): No worries! Always interesting discussing this kind of stuff
Bill: I’m up two hours too early and can’t get back to sleep 😭
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Missed the 9/11 discussion cuz sleep <:Shooketh_Honda_San:605590718026874901>

El🆓de Faun (Tom): YEEE
Aldus Larian (Jess): and my boss isnt here to give me last min work BLESS

Tikur (Kurtis): Why is it some work days the chaos is like a riptide and drags you down while other days you just bob along over it like a boat
Aldus Larian (Jess): what life serving up today for you?
Tikur (Kurtis): A wonderful platter of irate patients that don't want testing done to see how their various eye issues are doing.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Tom this sudoku sucks
Tikur (Kurtis): But I'm bobbing right over that sea of irate pirates cause it's mother freaking CCE DAY!!

Kaio Vermino (Lee): For what
Tikur (Kurtis): I'm gonna take a wild guess, really out of left field on this, and mabey just mabey think it's for speeding? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Speeding, I figured that was obvious 😅
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: There is absolutely no way I can deny I had every intention of leaving cruise on 80 mph the whole 27 miles so...
Nokri (Marisa): You know that’s illegal <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Bill: Ya, we did that the whole way to Otakon too
Tikur (Kurtis): Unrelated but  PSA time please protect your hearing.  I have a patient right now that wears hearing aids but can't hear anything unless you look him directly in the eyes, and then practically yell at him.
Nokri (Marisa): YEAH YOU WERE GOING 95 AT ONE POINT ANS MY LIFE FLASHED BEFORE MY EYES
Bill: I absolutely owe this 54 bucks sooooo yeah no arguments.
