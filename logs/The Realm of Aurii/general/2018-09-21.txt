Bill: Started watching The Good Cop on Netflix. It's pretty good.
Bill: I also like this thing they did because they know it's going to be binged. So the title sequence has the episode name as newspaper headlines and the director in the article. At the end of an episode, they drop a new paper on the old one with the next episode title. Then the next episode starts from there.
Bill: It's really smooth going from episode to episode.
