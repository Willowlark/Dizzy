Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Fun.com has another Doctor Who suit in black... might get that one too...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Is it also 30$
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I didn't get that one at first because the pocket square that comes with it is a print of the TARDIS and at first I thought it was actually printed on the jacket
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Weirdly enough I'd get it as a nicer looking suit for Jumin lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): im back from my nap too
N🆗ri (Marisa): depression nap <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): your suit for jumin already works perfectly tho, are you getting another?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's an older suit and doesn't fit as well anymore
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And these pants are a slimmer fit (which I like better and works better for Jumin)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then I can wear my fancy shoes only look good with slimmer pants
Aldus Larian (Jess): Fancy boi
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yoooo fancy
N🆗ri (Marisa): Looks like the material for ladybugs suit

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *You ain't nothing but a houndstooth suede shoe*
N🆗ri (Marisa): Quoth the king, “you ain’t nothin’ but a houndstooth pattern. Cryin’ all the time.”
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wait
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *You ain't nothing but a hounds bluetooth suede shoe*

N🆗ri (Marisa): ok now everybody take out your walking sticks and portraits of john allen
N🆗ri (Marisa): the cr1tikal post kills me every time it shows up on tumblr and all the memories of the american ninja warrior come rushing back
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTF
N🆗ri (Marisa): *do you know the story*
N🆗ri (Marisa): *of cr1tikal*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh I love cr1tikal
Aldus Larian (Jess): No and at this point I'm too afraid to ask
N🆗ri (Marisa): he was this anonymous youtuber who played games but no one knew what he looked like. leanna pls fill in any missing details because it was years ago and my memory is fuzzy. he would share stories sometimes of girls so people thought he was either super hot or he was full of himself.

so one day in a video he starts talking about how he went to american ninja warrior and was being this obnoxious airplane-noise making spinning guy in the audience. people went INSANE trying to find him in the audience of all episodes after that, scouring every little thing claiming they found cr1tikal. he wouldn't tell them what episode he was in or what he looked like.

then one day he randomly posted his snapchat and everyone started adding him. his first snap was of him playing the recorder(s? many recorders at once? can't remember) but everyone who saw it was like WOAH
N🆗ri (Marisa): out of nowhere people were absolutely losing it because the guy who never showed his face on youtube in y e a r s looked like
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA my friend Aliza told me about him I think
N🆗ri (Marisa): now he talks about naruto while playing runescape and tries to hide it but can't
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hes 👌 👌 👌
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): His voice does not match his appearance
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Which is what makes it even funnier
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How does he look so good in that apron what the fuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): Exposed shoulder
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's the sexieness of the possibility of the apron falling off
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Right? That's the idea
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): he also has good taste in interior decorating

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HES HAWT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Fuck...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Black and charcoal
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll have the Doctor Who suit trifecta
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok, I only bought one of them because I sized the jacket up and I want to see if it fits a little better
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then whichever size I choose, I'll try to return the other size and then order the better size along with suit #3

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So one of my professors from college has been working on a documentary about cell phone addiction for a couple years and he just updated the cover photo for its Facebook page with "anticipated release Summer 2019" and I was curious because I feel like he's changed the date before
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I went back through the photos on the page and I'm laughing so hard with how many times the release date has changed
Aldus Larian (Jess): He was distracted by his cell phone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Coming early 2017"
"Anticipated release Spring 2017"
"For release Fall '17"
"Anticipated release January 2018"
"Anticipated release Summer 2018"
"Anticipated release Summer 2019"*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He's just very scatterbrained and easily distracted
