Nokri (Marisa): except jess and Georgia we gotta bend ur thunbs
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😬 sounds like it would hurt
Nokri (Marisa): See like those are thumbs. They bend back. Yeah. 
But do your fingers also bend back or is your palm flat
Nokri (Marisa): Naw we can work on it I’m sure there’s a pain free way
Nokri (Marisa): Why do hands do that
Afina (Georgia🍀):

Aldus (Jess): I just painted my nails ok I did it just for these photos
Nokri (Marisa): I forgot this somehow came up before and Dave and I are thumb buddies
Nokri (Marisa): Jess your nails are very Kawaii are they still drying maybe that’s affecting your bending
Nokri (Marisa): 
Bill: How the fuck did that come up?
Nokri (Marisa): Via the natural course of decent normal conversation as is usual
Nokri (Marisa): Imagine a conversation but it’s narrated like a wildlife documentary on animal planet
Bill: By Morgan freeman.
Nokri (Marisa): Now that jess has perfectly manicured nails she can do this
Nokri (Marisa): 
Aldus (Jess): Ah yes that was the plan
Afina (Georgia🍀): Lady Whoozica, queen of the lizards
Elfriede (Tom): What is even happening
Nokri (Marisa): so like can you guys scratch your own back if your fingers don't fold backwards
is that why people have difficulty reaching their back or is it another reason
Elfriede (Tom): i think its just shoulder flexability
Elfriede (Tom): and shoulder width
Afina (Georgia🍀): Or if you have a super long arm or back
Elfriede (Tom): like i can but i dont know the perameters of which allows me to do that
Afina (Georgia🍀): _go go gadget back scratcher_
Afina (Georgia🍀): I can, I think it's cause I have a smol back
Nokri (Marisa): imagine if humans had one more joint in their arms. like, two elbows.
Elfriede (Tom): *imagine*
Afina (Georgia🍀): ***id rather not***

Afina (Georgia🍀): mmmm i was thinking about my birthday
Afina (Georgia🍀): does it look bad if i invite all of BNE except snow...
Bill: PA group might be bothered.
Bill: Don’t invite her tho.
Afina (Georgia🍀): reasons?
Bill: You don’t have to give any.
Afina (Georgia🍀): but i wanna avoid drama :/
Bill: Giving reasons makes drama.
Afina (Georgia🍀): i mean i wont tell people reasons duh
Afina (Georgia🍀): but isnt it safer to just invite her to avoid drama with BNE?
Afina (Georgia🍀): then again, BNE arent the confrontational type
Bill: I don't trust her. Watch she posts tons of stories about her and friend wezrez cosplay.
Bill: A week before RTX.
Bill: we spent a whole afternoon playing public relations. Entirely because of her.
Bill: It's your birthday, you should not have to have your guard up.
Afina (Georgia🍀): truuuue alright

Afina (Georgia🍀): All tucked in and shit
Afina (Georgia🍀): I wanna say #only on the science campus
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I think history or literature profs might do the same tbh
Aldus (Jess): i think its a bandanna
Bill: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_tie
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah that
Bill: `In Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, it was revealed that Fred's father Fred Jones Sr. was not, in fact, his biological father, but instead a man who kidnapped him as a child and raised him as his own son. His biological parents Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves later returned, but Fred continued to use the last name of Jones. In the series finale, when the universe is restarted to where Fred was never raised by Fred Jones Sr., but rather his biological parents, it is never stated what his last name is in the new reality` 

WHAT TEH FUCK
Eliran (Halim): Dont invite her
Make it a private event to
Eliran (Halim): Wait scooby doo had a universe reset
Eliran (Halim): What
Bill: It's one of the new iterations.
Aldus (Jess): damn scooby doo got serious
Bill: they're all separate, pretty much... but that one sounds *terrible*.
Bill: ` Standing in the way of solving this mystery, however, there are the romantic entanglements pulling the kids apart: Shaggy finds himself unable to put his new romance with Velma ahead of his longtime friendship with Scooby, while Daphne pines for a trap-obsessed Fred, who obliviously struggles to realize he shares her feelings, too.`
Bill: What the hell man.
Aldus (Jess): fred likes traps?! 😂
Bill: `In Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Daphne is in love with Fred, and in the episode "Dead Justice" they have their first kiss and Fred asks her to marry him. In later episodes, the engagement is broken off and their relationship continues to evolve. It is never revealed if they became married or not. In the episode "When the Cicada Calls," they have their first date at the Trap Exhibit 3000.`
Bill: Oh hey, they're doing a new "The New Scooby Doo Movies". The ones with the celebrity guest stars.
Bill: `Guest stars that have been announced for the show include Chris Paul, Sia, Halsey, Ricky Gervais, Kenan Thompson, Bill Nye, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Mark Hamill, along with fictional characters such as Steve Urkel, Batman, Sherlock Holmes, The Flash and Wonder Woman.`
Bill: The edgy reboot has a split trope page. (There are so many entries they split them alphabetically across more pages, in this case A-C, D-H, I-R,S-Z.)
Bill: damn.
Bill: *What did you do to my childhood Cartoon Network*
Afina (Georgia🍀): Wow what the fuck
Bill: the tropes are crazy.
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I PROBABLY just ruined some lady's day but I'm not sorry about it
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I was in the right lane, and it was an 18 wheeler and then a cop car and then me
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I switched to the left lane and I didn't realize this lady was gunning it so I sorta cut her off
Afina (Georgia🍀): So she tailgates me, all in front of this cop, and honks at me
Afina (Georgia🍀): (I can't keep starting with "so" omg) and then I moved to the right lane in front of the 18 wheeler, and the lady shoots past me, pedal to the metal, and the cop flips on his lights to chase her down
Bill: She should pay attention.
Aldus (Jess): LMAO
Afina (Georgia🍀): And that's how I ruined some middle aged angry lady's day
Afina (Georgia🍀): Im lowkey proud of it cause she seemed like a jerk
Bill: drive aggressively, hell, I do, but pay attention if there's a friggin cop.
Elfriede (Tom): Don't drive aggressively
Bill: 
Bill: Totally thought that one in the middle was Jess.
Elfriede (Tom): Pfft nah, she looks spanish
Elfriede (Tom): Granted that's assuming alot
Elfriede (Tom): But yeah instant karma on that old lady
Elfriede (Tom): I love stories like that

Afina (Georgia🍀): in the typical "good advice billiam" way
Bill: Implying I can give bad advice. 😎
