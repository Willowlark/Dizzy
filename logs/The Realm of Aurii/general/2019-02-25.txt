N🆗ri (Marisa): These outfits are moods
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): That woman has so many stuffed animals on the train of her drrsss
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): fabulous
Bill: leanna
Bill: !mdl
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WAT
Bill: I'm trying to make a command on Dizzy to delete any message with Leanna in the message, cause with Kurto dating her I'd like to invite her... Or is that *excessively* paranoid.
Bill: Saying it sounds paranoid.
Bill: thoughts.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We haven’t said anything bad I think it’s fine?
Quick check the search bar for anything bad
Bill: ye.
Dirty Lego (Tom): I'd say give it a bit
Bill: I guess. Her and Erik are integrating with Aurii pretty quickly so I'd like to seal it sometime soon.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I mean Kurtis doesn't talk much here
Bill: Not the only reason. I basically told Erik we're adopting him and if that's the core of us it's Aurii.
Bill: Same thing with Leanna.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Mmkay
Bill: Hey. Maybe they'll read Marisa Quest or Aurii and want to know whats up.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i suddenly remembered the quest's existence midway through katsucon and it was the most horrifying moment of my life
tom can attest
Bill: tell me about it. lol Aurii.
Bill: I liked the snippet btw Tom. That was neat.
Bill: Wow fuck it windy.
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH it spooky
N🆗ri (Marisa): I was reorganizing my anime shelves and accidentally made a shrine
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): kyooooot
N🆗ri (Marisa): im tryna find my cat figures i got from another shrine to also act as guardians because currently it's a super inari shrine with all foxes
N🆗ri (Marisa): they were one of the pricier things i bought in japan but i'm so happy i got those little foxes. i've wanted them since 2016 because if you go to fushimi inari all you see is just BAM
N🆗ri (Marisa): and when i bought them i got to have a nice chat with the shrine maiden while she told me about stuff and gave me lots of tiny origami
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): they are neato
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): WHOA thats really coo
N🆗ri (Marisa): fushimi inari is great. "evil spirits u came to the wrong neighborhood"
N🆗ri (Marisa): i lost my sd card with most of the pictures i took though hhh i think it's lost forever, like i lost it at an airport, but i'm hoping it reappears some day
N🆗ri (Marisa): i at least backed up my top favorite pictures!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): THATS SO COO
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i really highly recommend fushimi inari shrine!! when i was in kyoto i purposefully booked a place as close to it as possible so i could get there early in the morning before crowds showed up
N🆗ri (Marisa): you would also like kasuga taisha it's like princess mononoke irl
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): OO neaato
N🆗ri (Marisa): my favorite place in japan is Enoshima though and i had to sit through a 40 minute lesson where one of my students just bash it because they go there every weekend to surf and they hate it lol
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): aurii trip to japan when
Dirty Lego (Tom): YEAH IT SO WINDY
Dirty Lego (Tom): IT GO *WOOOOOOO OOOOOFFF OOOOOFFF*
Dirty Lego (Tom): LMAO IT AUTO CORRECTED IT TO TO THAT WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH THATS HOW IT GOES
N🆗ri (Marisa): me: tatsumi is so pure she's the best
tatsumi's twitter page: [very explicit image she drew with the caption "dirty old man"]
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): who dat
N🆗ri (Marisa): yaoi south park girl!
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ooooo!
N🆗ri (Marisa): girls in japan are really good at like. hiding their hobbies i guess?
like nanako is the exact image someone would have of a stereotypical good japanese girl, perfect at everything, then after school she goes to karaoke and downs 8 shots of liquor.
these girls are all prim and proper, posting pictures of bunnies and flowers they raise followed by the explicit yaoi they draw and dirty jokes they come up with about their anime obsession
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's fascinating
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea i could see that
Dirty Lego (Tom): Wack
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): I think i want new glasses
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): im thinking purple
N🆗ri (Marisa): get ur purple glasses
N🆗ri (Marisa): sparkly purple or matte?
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont know yet!
N🆗ri (Marisa): 😎
N🆗ri (Marisa): purple glasses fit mina aesthetic
glasses mina
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i think purple makes me eyes stand out
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): or pink
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but purples more subdued
Bill: ooooh, Japneet got us notebooks and pens for the office and I'm low key stealing the pen cause it smooth as fuck.
Bill: Like, makes me wish I learned cursive smooth.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Learn now!
Bill: for you <@!228287793099440128> <:do_you_know_the_way:549662837404991491>
バナナ: Beautiful
N🆗ri (Marisa): "i've been looking to make a new dnd character" is basically a cry to be invited to aurii
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): TRU
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i wonder what kind of character erik would build
Bill: I mean, Aurii isn't running right now but.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that can be changed
Bill: ~~I did my part~~
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): toms ooc post reminded me that i typed up a whole afrin thing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): ~~does that mean i should share it~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): owo
Bill: All the stuff is out there to get started again, but the new character sheets never happened so until it does...
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): /tryna remember why i didnt update mune
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): RIGHT i couldnt think of anything
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): i was stuck on coming up with stunts for afina
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Why do we need new character sheets again?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): wow wtf i just had to make up one "per arc" stunt and i was done, past georgia is a quitter
Bill: new game system that was more aspect focused than wushu, which was pretty cheese.
Bill: It was a pretty minor change to the sheets themselves, rules side I'd have covered it.
Bill: Invite to Erik be drafted. Man, it's been awhile since anyone new came in here...
Bill: Makes me nervous.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): O YOU INVITED HIM?
Bill: Drafted.
N🆗ri (Marisa): you drew him in autoCAD?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): you sent him to the army?
Bill: Okay. New message to invite Erik here drafted.
Bill: I just get scared to change status quo.
Bill: ,... well. Hesitation screwed me the last time.
Bill: The train bounced my finger on the enter key so shits happening.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> incoming...
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh no what do I do
N🆗ri (Marisa): We haven’t had anyone new in like two years
Bill: More like a year or so. When did Ash join?

N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ll show you around. This is where we meme, and over there is where we meme on ourselves.
Bill: ~~more motivation for the game itself~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we meme everywhere
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~or bitch~~
Bill: ~~bitch *everywhere*~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we have 2 games but both are on hiatus atm, hoping to change that!
Bill: *hopefully*.
Bill: We also have like, every channel BNE has because we had this server months before BNE existed. We just got rid of RWBY spoilers cause those conversations are more fun with the group.
Bill: fuck it two birds same message. Let's get Kurto's girlfriend in the squad.
N🆗ri (Marisa): O I can start the quest up again and recap it later tonight if there’s any interest
But also our mystic mess chat is the anime chat
Bill: *I now realize why you guys thought that was weird*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): cuz its a game? XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea that always confused me but i decided not to question you
Bill: Could change gears... tbh we barely need the split channels for that.
Bill: video games get talked about in SMASH rather than here.

N🆗ri (Marisa): Friends for Nokri <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: I'm positive they don't want to read the what, thousand pages that was the first season.

Bill: Tis okay. I do most of the rule stuff.
Leanna: Okie dokie
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah if fine
Bill: Slong as you’re willing to learn and stay on top of reading everyone’s posts, you’ll be fine.
Leanna: ~~what else am I gonna do at work~~ yea I gotcha
Bill: So basically. Goof off here at work and you’re set.
Bill: You get it.
