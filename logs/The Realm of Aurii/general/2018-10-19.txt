Andrew: dunno if hes older
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): brb looking up the zally's family tree
one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa): bhtyk i can't find the info.
what was going around the rumor mill is that the youngest brother owned that store you worked at and another one that's like five minutes away, and he had a big fight with his older shoprite siblings who basically cut ties with him, and he had a big of a struggle with the current shoprite so he decided to close the two down and open the bigger one where kmart was. but that's 100% unconfirmed.
