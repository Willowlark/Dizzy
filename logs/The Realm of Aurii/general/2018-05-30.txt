Afina (Georgia🍀): Soooooo unless I wanna drive to the Goddard Space Center three hours south (plus D.C. traffic).....
Bill: And? Tell her your boyfriend is in that area and you’d love to meet when you visit.
Bill: That’s half the distance and the rest is worth it.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _billiam then I just seen like a stalker_
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'll be content with an email for now and then maybe I'll contact her when I'm "in the area"
Afina (Georgia🍀): So I seem less like I'm chasing her lol
Bill: Shows how interested you are. What’s the worst that can happen, she says no? It’s all about who you know. She could be your in for an internship.
Bill: Have some confidence. 😁
Afina (Georgia🍀): /Silent screaming

Afina (Georgia🍀): But apparently they also love me
Nokri (Marisa): maybe they're the op? but it still makes no sense <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina (Georgia🍀): 
Afina (Georgia🍀): Clarification acquired
Nokri (Marisa): CAKE IS A EUPHEMISM?

Nokri (Marisa): how lewd

https://youtu.be/TL_A9rro8EI?t=112
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no moms and sons shouldn't sing about butt

Bill: *Paul McBride at IBM*
Nokri (Marisa): sounds hot
Aldus (Jess): Well she sounds hideous
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ❤ ❤
Bill: *Well she’s a guy so*
Aldus (Jess): What are you wearing Paul McBride from IBM
Nokri (Marisa): we have a guy at work who wants to be called paul. his real name is very japanese but at the top of his file it says "Please call him Paul." so when I met him i was like "hi are you paul" and he's like "yeAH I'M PAUL HI" and it was nice.
Bill: It’s just the time zones but Paul. I’m still in bed.
Aldus (Jess): Lmao is that like when I was in Spanish class in elementary school they gave us "Spanish names"
Aldus (Jess): And it looks me a really long time to figure out that your name doesn't change depending on the language
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: That's adorable
Nokri (Marisa): maybe??? I hadn't thought of that omg
we had medieval names in elementary school when we studied the middle ages and "Lettuce" was on the list of names so I made my name Lettuce Cabbage
Aldus (Jess): thats awesome
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Lmaooo
Aldus (Jess): i love reading articles about people going to different countries and talking about cultural differences .
Aldus (Jess): im reading this article about this guy that came here from Ireland for a year and v. interesting
Nokri (Marisa): what was he surprised about
Aldus (Jess): 1. we are too easily offended
2. we say awesome too much
3. we smile too much and its often not genuine
4. tipping
theres more but i haven't gotten there
Nokri (Marisa): omg we are not easily offended how dare he. we're too awesome to be easily offended. 😃
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Sugoi
Nokri (Marisa): i agree on smiling and tipping
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeah same
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: What about the good stuff?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: It's not only bad right? That's biased<:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): the offended thing was because american often sugar coat the truth to not hurt feelings
Aldus (Jess): yea theres good stuff too:
well connected
diversity in things to do and see
HA funnily enough: conferences and conventions for special interests
lots of friends
open minded
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokri (Marisa): emphasis on open minded
Nokri (Marisa): sometimes i say silly things to get a point across and people are like "what??? whAT????"
like. if I'm teaching a lesson on voicing opinions I'll be like "we should paint the office wall purple" and without fail every single student has been like "you're insane why would you paint it purple"
it's just. purple? purple can be nice.
Nokri (Marisa): time to go to ireland and talk smack about ireland
Aldus (Jess): purple is beautiful
Nokri (Marisa): [jumin heart appears]
Aldus (Jess): another personal fave was one about the girl who went to japan and got a bf there and he came over and it was hot so she was like "well im gonna go shower" and he was like "oh that means were gonna do it? ok" and they were both very confused
Nokri (Marisa): wHAT
Nokri (Marisa): WHAT
Nokri (Marisa): ??
Bill: how do you not know that Marisa?
Nokri (Marisa): ??????????????????????????????????????????????
Aldus (Jess): they always shower right before so the do
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Cuzsexisillegal🌽
Aldus (Jess): v. clean probable a good idea
Bill: It's also a one person job in japan.
Nokri (Marisa): I mainly hear stories about girls being too nice. Like, one girl told me about when she was at a party in the US and after everyone ate she went into the kitchen to clean the dishes and the host was like "uh why are you cleaning my dishes"
and a similar thing about folding laundry. a girl was at her boyfriend's parents house and started folding the laundry and the mother was like "wat u doin"
Aldus (Jess): oh yea, i mean we do that hear but people ussually ask "do you need help?"
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~thats why when the guy or girl goes over the apartment in animu and showers it's lewd~~
Aldus (Jess): that so much presure
Nokri (Marisa): i need to make friends so i can confirm or deny this
Aldus (Jess): like "man i really need a shower but i dont want him to think im coming onto him"
Aldus (Jess): ohhh then the same girls bf got all freaked out when she start to like move while doing it. he was like  "uhhh what are you doing?"
Nokri (Marisa): leaving and never returning
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: ~~he said it made him feel gay~~
Aldus (Jess): ye dat too
Nokri (Marisa): i'm gonna go take a shower but no lewd just hygiene
Nokri (Marisa): i still can't understand it sounds terrifying
Nokri (Marisa): with how obsessed people are with cleanliness here how could that be
Aldus (Jess): yea thats why they do it though, so they are clean for the do, i wonder if they take another after too
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: No she's just shocked they do it at all! Not possible! To unclean!
Aldus (Jess): OH
Bill: *Did that just take a dark turn, orrrr*
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: https://imgur.com/gallery/s9XBYOc
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Dark?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Did I miss something?
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Wow guys, I can't believe Marisa is taking a shower
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: How lewd
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Being clean
Bill: Please take showers everyone.
Bill: ~~says me, hasn't showered yet~~
Bill: Love being able to mute video on the morning cadence.
Nokri (Marisa): omg this person is so sneaky
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): they don't follow me i think they're just commenting that on whatever shows up in a certain tag at the time
Nokri (Marisa): they appear to be a real person but that's a super bot-y thing to do
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeee..... It possible
Bill: Ooooh, I forgot, Dad's fancy gaming table is coming today.
Nokri (Marisa): i started making plans to cosplay nanachi just now and of course I decide "oh the best time to wear a full-body fursuit is otakon during the middle of summer"
Nokri (Marisa): for next year
Bill: *wear it... elsewhere?*
Nokri (Marisa): but biru......................................................................................... why
Nokri (Marisa): all my hottest cosplays debuted at otakon <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Because Katsu is in the winter?
Nokri (Marisa): oh yeah
but i'll be japan probably <:rip:369476083248267274>
Nokri (Marisa): if i install fans in my pants maybe it'll impress the judges at the cosplay contest
Nokri (Marisa): during the katsucon fire alarm
so many poor girls in bikinis stuck in below freezing temperatures
Nokri (Marisa): one i spoke with had a giant harness on her back with wings so she couldn't even put on a jacket
Nokri (Marisa): this textbook is listing all the genius stuff i was gonna bring up in my reaction paper ugh
i can't believe the textbook stole my ideas
Bill: you ever feel like a teenager who just happens to have a bunch of responsibilities?
Nokri (Marisa): but could a teenager do THIS
Bill: capitalize a word?
Bill: Maybe?
Nokri (Marisa): Takes years of experience. Also if I raise my arms like 30 different joints crack and I don’t think teens have the skill to do that either.
Bill: But like, sometimes I'm like 'when I'm an adult' and then I remember I am an adult.
Bill: > start writing notes on release of api
> half way through thought
> *who the fuck is going to read this*
> backspaceX84
Bill: HAHAHAHAAAA
Bill: <@!351471675843411978>, apparently instagram is able to fill the blank between your twitter from high school and the instagram tag.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I hate when stereotypes are true, the Rutgers science campus is just SO many dudes
Bill: I hate it too.
Afina (Georgia🍀): From my car to my class I passed two girls
Afina (Georgia🍀): W h a t
Bill: such a high number.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Yeahh...
Bill: similarly, I wonder what'd be different if my freshmen year was in a co-ed dorm like most dorms are.
Bill: My dorm life was 16 guys in the CS program, most of which who dropped out half way through the year.
Bill: While it wasn't the CS dorm with all the league players (the college somehow got them all into one section), some variety would have been good I think. Of majors/people.
Aldus (Jess): Uggg that's annoying
Bill: ~~I thought so too~~ Yeah, but at least it doesn't tag someone else. Pretty sure wezrez is someone else on twitter.
Bill: https://www.songkick.com/artists/440854-pillows <@!351785752197201920>
Bill: or maybe not.
Aldus (Jess): maybe i used facebook to sign up for it
Bill: same username?
Aldus (Jess): no but my real name
Aldus (Jess): i think whoozica is only snapchat and insta, but who knows
Aldus (Jess): yea my twitter handle is <@!351471675843411978>hammerle
Bill: weiiiird
Aldus (Jess): i used facebook to sign up for insta, i probably used it to sign up for twitter too
Bill: that would do it.
Aldus (Jess): i only made the twitter for my social media class in college
Bill: I am *so* bored today.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I already went to office hours and its only day two look how committed i am
Bill: Course I'm assuming you went cause you needed help, not just for brownie points.
Afina (Georgia🍀): no yeah there was one problem that some kid went up to do but his handwriting was SHIT
Afina (Georgia🍀): so i was like uhhhhhhhhhhhh that could be numbers i guess
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oof yeah, that'd warrant it
Bill: Probably me.
Bill: My handwriting is bad.
Bill: <@!351785752197201920> https://www.facebook.com/events/298533237349314/ That's the right one.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ah nicu! Will also forward to joe
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: This just in,Reddit passed Facebook in web traffic popularity?
Bill: Facebook's on a decline. Has been for awhile.
Aldus (Jess): facebook sucks butts
Aldus (Jess): im done
Aldus (Jess): can i go home
Bill: <@!351471675843411978> send me the BNE flag image?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why is there traffic it's only 4
Aldus (Jess): cant its at home
Aldus (Jess): what do you need a facebook event cover photo?
Bill: course.
Bill: and I apparently didn't save a copy.
Bill: found it in the backlog, all good.
Afina (Georgia🍀): What's the title? "Cosplay photoshoot hosted by Beqcon northeast"?
Bill: BNE Chestnut Hill Photoshoot.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I like
Afina (Georgia🍀): Tho maybe cosplay photoshoot part first is more straightforward
Bill: Put you and Mark as co-hosts.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeet
Bill: well, it's only getting shared to friends really. Not like we have to sell it to randoms.
Bill: Just trying to think of any other big description worth additions.
Bill: These bird feeder photos would be a million times better if I had a 300mm zoom lens.
Bill: ~~guess I better make a kofi~~
