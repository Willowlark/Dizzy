Nokri (Marisa): one time at walmart i saw a used needle on the ground (not of the sewing variety) and when I told a staff member they picked it up with their bare hands
Elfriede (Tom): AHH
Nokri (Marisa): u know they ded
Aldus (Jess): OMG Y THEY DO THAT
Nokri (Marisa): maybe it happens so often they're desensitized to it
Nokri (Marisa): desanitized to it

Afina (Georgia🍀): My roomie went to bed at 9
Afina (Georgia🍀): Huh
Aldus (Jess): Dang
Afina (Georgia🍀): She's not in the military so she doesn't have to be up early
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I guess she likes to have 10 hours of sleep or something
Afina (Georgia🍀): It's a good thing we have a shared living room for when I wanna be awake then
Nokri (Marisa): relatable
is the living room separate from the sleeping room? that's nice
Bill: Think my apartment with one more room and 2 to a room Marisa.
Nokri (Marisa): y'all livin in mansions omg
Nokri (Marisa): does it have a view
Nokri (Marisa): i was immediately able to pull an old notebook out from under 6 months' worth of stuff in a pile and dig out pen refills from a random bag but i was shocked to see i had folded and put away jeans in the closet where they belong.

Nokri (Marisa): That there be an age old tale
Bill: Wait... It can't be back to school traffic can it?
Nokri (Marisa): Haha nerds.
Nokri (Marisa): Today in school the teacher asked who can pronounce old English and read Hebrew and like a nerd I raised my hand for both and he made me read stuff without giving me extra credit. I have learned never to raise my hand ever again.

Afina (Georgia🍀): My roommate is REALLY quiet, I don't think we're gonna talk much but she's pleasant
Afina (Georgia🍀): The two girls on the end are Kesha and Surabhi and I haven't seen either of them much cause they're quiet and keep to themselves
