Bill: ~~I bought the thing~
Nokri (Marisa): I went through four pens during that test. Wound up finishing with a pencil. Rest in pieces. They were the cool frixion pens too.
Nokri (Marisa): Three hours and 20 pages single spaced.  should be illegal.
Bill: what the fuck.
Aldus (Jess): OMG that sounds misrable
Bill: that's insane.
Nokri (Marisa): the last essay i wrote i had a whole thing planned out and then 10 minutes before time was up i just blanked out and wrote "thank you for reading" and got up <:lenny:395307171539189760>
we were allowed a break in between the two sections but there wasn't really any time to spare at all unless you were absolutely dying.
Nokri (Marisa): i felt really bad because i was kind of spacing out at work but i had to rush to the test right after so rip
Bill: Didn't you quit?
Nokri (Marisa): **it's manga time**
Nokri (Marisa): ha. hahaha. yeahhh about that. nah.
Bill: ~~Better than maid cafe~~
Nokri (Marisa): i talked to my boss and he said since my visa isn't sponsored by them and i'm technically a contractor i can just not work yet still be an employee, so i can work like once or twice a month if I want. i figured it looks better on a resume to work for a place for longer, and then i'll just let my contract expire in december.
Nokri (Marisa): i feel so bad for the maids and the owl girls when it rains i want to chat with them in the rain
Bill: That‚Äôs a better solution anyway, rather than working hours set by the cafe.
Nokri (Marisa): my co-workers made fun of me today for sounding like a disney princess i'm gonna sue them for harassment
Nokri (Marisa): but it was funny hearing "hello, how are you?" in a really girly voice echoing around the workplace for 3 minutes
Nokri (Marisa): 'hewwo'
Bill: Hewwo indeed.
Nokri (Marisa): hows everyone doin tonight what's the deal with airline food
Bill: Eh. Got a GI appointment at 1:30.
Bill: Cause I has ulcer, weeee~
Nokri (Marisa): you're in the military????
Nokri (Marisa): o another gi
Nokri (Marisa): yay
Aldus (Jess): I ordered business cards for one of my bosses but they arent on the stock I (he) wanted, also some random words are bold for no reason? so now ive gotta talk to them and try to figure out weather it was my mistake or theirs
Nokri (Marisa): strong cards. bolded means they will fight.
