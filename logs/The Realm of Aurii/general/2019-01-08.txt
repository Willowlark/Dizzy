Bill: I want starbuckksssssss but I have them with toooo manyyy carbsssss
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What do you wanna get? ðŸ˜®
Bill: The hot chocolates have like, 40 carbs and since I double sweeten the iced green tea that's about the same.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Oof yea
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You could do stevia in green tea instead
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Green tea takes a lot more to get it sweet
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It's prob closer to 60
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): But yeah like Jess said stevia is a good alternative
Bill: It's liquid sweetener rip
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Y'all just gotta give in to the bitter taste life <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: I use Truvia in my hot teas, the iced teas have the liquid stuff.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): You can ask for stevia intead of the liquid stuff tho
Bill: I find it doesn't dissolve...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Hmm
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Never had that problem but it's been a long time since I've sweetened iced tea
Bill: Also the starbucks in IBM is kinda crappy, so going off book is weird here.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Iâ€™m headed to bed in a bit but heads up I may be rather quiet the next few days as I freak out and stress about moving again. 
Also we had to cancel our internet at home in the US because it expensive and weâ€™re going to reactive it soon but currently the appointment is scheduled for a week after I get back so I might not have internet for a while unless we can get the appointment moved up. My phoneâ€™ll work though.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Wow there was just some kind of siren outside and it sounded absolutely horrifying
Bill: You gotta check in with us about when your flight status is though.
Bill: I wanna track your flight like a kid watching the santa tracker
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Ya Iâ€™ll try
I hear TSA is in a pinch now and I have a very short layover so Iâ€™ll be sprinting as fast as possible when I get to the US to make the connection.  Iâ€™ll send my flight numbers tomorrow when I print out all the info.
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Get some popcorn ready
Bill: Already ready.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea TSA is like semi shutdiwn cuz they are a government entity <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): From what I read theyâ€™re considered essential personnel and still working, but they arenâ€™t getting paid so a lot of them are calling out sick or protesting by not going to work
Nokwi-chan uwu (Marisa): Good times
