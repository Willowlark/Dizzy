秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): If tumblr is dead then how do we explain this
秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Hiroshima still has a fully functioning electric tram system throughout the city and it’s more convenient than trains. That’s really interesting seeing as Tokyo only has one left.
Bill: Huh. Had a dream where I was starting college again. Some big as heck school. I somehow got on the anime club eboard before I even found my dorm, and even better ended up an officer for some kind of mafia that ran a bar on campus, despite not having a record.
Bill: What a trip.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nice
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@!301927856240459777>  are you still in hiroshima 😮
Bill: quiet.
Bill: I can actually fit *two* more prints.
Bill: Yo I have so much energy today.
Bill: It's either I got used to the new bed and had the best night sleep I've had in *years*, or the sun being out maybe...
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): big sun energy
Bill: ~~until Tom eats it~~
Bill: Oh question, am I the only person on the planet who thinks undercut haircuts aren't cute?

Bill: I feel like the minority with it I admit lol.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): because cosplay community
Bill: Figured but checked anyway~~
Bill: God I can tell the quality of the knife I bought recently by how it took a few swipes on the sharpener and it's *razor* sharp.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): back to hair, i feel the same way about buzzcuts on men XD
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~or just short hair in general~~
Bill: Jess: *If I can't mistake it for a bear humping him from behind, it's not long enough*
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats is just about the least attractive picture you could have chosen
Bill: ~~that’s the point~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): oh ok

秋の栗は美味いでしょう(Marisa): Japanese TV has been talking about the same news event for like 3 days. In the US it’d be a big deal for two hours and then everyone would forget but every time I look at the TV there’s the Sapporo fire
