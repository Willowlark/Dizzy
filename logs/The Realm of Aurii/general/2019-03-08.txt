Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wat
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 1. rude to make that comment about your boobs
2. I'm guessing they're referring to the guitar pressing against your chest while playing? Which like, isn't a typical positioning of a guitar when you're playing. It's usually lower
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Plus the diver in the guitar contours the hobbies
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They should make a guitar designed for women with two cutouts in the top specifically designed for supporting lady guitarist bobbies
Bill: I dunno if those would sell that well...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The *Bra-tocaster*

N🆗ri (Marisa): it's been 2019 for 3 months already
N🆗ri (Marisa): long overdue
Bill: Looked at a German Shetland mom found on Facebook.
N🆗ri (Marisa): congrats on your new dog
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do you un-color a fabric you just bleach it right
Aldus Larian (Jess): Depends I think?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): bleach and a prayer
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmmm
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Bill: Don’t think so... she very thin, and high energy. Tbh think she better off with a family with kids. We’re too laid back.
Bill: She just want love tho and aww.
N🆗ri (Marisa): google stop recommending me pokemon furry art pls i just want reference images
Bill: For your Pokémon fursona?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i'm gonna be lazy sunday of zenkai because i have to get up at 8 so im rebooting my pokemon trainer cosplay. not bringing ninetails but im making meowth and might bring flaaffy if I make new eyes
N🆗ri (Marisa): plus can wear staff t-shirt
N🆗ri (Marisa): ACTUALLY. I should draft a pattern based off the cats from monster hunter. they have more realistic proportions and will help more.
Bill: But ninetails.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is really big. i used it as a bed when i slept on the floor at otakon. i can't easily lug it around with me on patrols and other staffers in the room might get annoyed
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's like 5' long and nearly 4' tall
N🆗ri (Marisa): might not bring flaaffy because it's about 2' tall. meowth i'm hoping to stick on my shoulders or arm, and caterpie if I can find where i put it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Would you ever... do ~~reasonably sized~~ lifesize Pokémon plushes... for commission... ?
Bill: Only if by reasonably sized you mean taller than you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): mmmmmmmmmmmmaybe <:thinku:543194478614413318> I've considered it before but i always rush the stuff I make and I'm always dissatisfied with it so I feel it's not good enough to sell
meowth might change that! probably not but the chance is there.
N🆗ri (Marisa): why they gotta be furry that's my biggest gripe. i'm gonna make alolan meowth out of the fabric I 
oh no sylvia is yelling at me she realized i'm leaving again oh no ;A;
out of the fabric i bought for the itabag because it's kind of furry and grey, but if I had longer grey fur that didn't cost $20 an inch I'd use that instead
N🆗ri (Marisa): she sat on my stuff as i was typing so i guess im never leaving
N🆗ri (Marisa): Why is it socially unacceptable for humans to scratch their back with a tree. Bears can do it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is it not fair to the tree
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok yeah that would be harassment
