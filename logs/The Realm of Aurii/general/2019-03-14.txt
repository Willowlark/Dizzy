N🆗ri (Marisa): Picking up regalia, rehearsing, and the ceremony is all on the same day lol
Bill: Had a dream that IBM wanted me to take GREs and I was like. “I already have a masters this is pointless”. Then I ended up doodling on the test paper instead of starting.
N🆗ri (Marisa): That so expensive though :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg I think I don’t have to work today
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t yehaw the president is too tired to bother unlocking the office and disarming the alarm and since everyone else is on vacation he’s just closing it for the day <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

I have sensitive teeth what if I break them by crunching
N🆗ri (Marisa): I can’t move Sylvia has arrived
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Where do you work atm?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Katsu crunch for next year
N🆗ri (Marisa): The homeowners association in my development
Yesterday they tried to get me to talk to an Asian couple that didn’t speak English. They spoke Chinese and Vietnamese I was like “<:lenny:395307171539189760>”
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh nooo
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's supposed to be warm today I'm excited
N🆗ri (Marisa): Jess cosplay
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ooof
Aldus Larian (Jess): I can't 😭 I at work
N🆗ri (Marisa): **cosplay**
Aldus Larian (Jess): But but I has no cosplays
N🆗ri (Marisa): You do. Believe in yourself.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have a big calendar annndddd tissues and paperclips
Aldus Larian (Jess): Actually I have white duck tape that probably enough to make a top
N🆗ri (Marisa): There you go!!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Have you ever been to an iron cosplay competition
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo no in high school I had to make an outfit out of duck tape tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): Let’s enter an iron cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s perfect
N🆗ri (Marisa): 15 minutes to build a cosplay out of duct tape and random stuff provided by the host in teams of... up to 4 I think?
N🆗ri (Marisa): There’s always a secret ingredient. Last time I went to one it was SO much glitter.
Bill: And now I took the ferry to enjoy the weather. Your fault Jess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the furry
Aldus Larian (Jess): Good.
Bill: It. Still a bit chilly with wind. But being inside ferry is lame.
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk what to cosplay
N🆗ri (Marisa): lounge around the house as..... [spins wheel] ranka lee idk
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): i could unpack from katsu
N🆗ri (Marisa): but eh
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats prob a good idea
N🆗ri (Marisa): eh
N🆗ri (Marisa): does something have to be conscious to detect other consciouses (whatever the plural is)
can a machine detect if something is conscious? if it can does that mean the machine itself is conscious? could the machine detect its own consciousness and if it does is it a bug or is it really conscious and how do we prove it. another conscious-detecting machine?
Bill: ~~stop reading seed~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh did that update
N🆗ri (Marisa): no that's a sunday comic
N🆗ri (Marisa): well we know in that comic that turry is conscious
but like. could turry detect if a mushroom or blade of grass has a conscious
Aldus Larian (Jess): Imagine giving a guy you like chocolate on valentines day and then having to wait a whole month to see if he likes you too damn that sound nerve wracking
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is that what white day is?
N🆗ri (Marisa): and guys don't give obligation chocolate isn't that messed up
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye
N🆗ri (Marisa): girls have to give out a ton of obligation chocolate on vaneltines day, and then honmei chocolate is the "i like u" chocolate
guys just give store bought chocolate to the girl they like and all the girls who bought 'em obligation chocolate get nothing
Aldus Larian (Jess): D: who made this rule
Bill: Yo I'll take giri chocolate.
Bill: I get no honmei chocolate.
Bill: ~~Actually because I'm a prideful fuck I'd hate giri chocolate slash that~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): black thunder made a special giri chocolate flavor this year called greek (girik) yogurt chocolate it's really funny
Aldus Larian (Jess): o theres pepero day in korea too

Bill: Or did I give it to you later in the weekend?
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH yea maybe it was friday
Aldus Larian (Jess): rip. marisa is my true love
Bill: It may have been thursday. Not my favorite holiday so I wasn't thinking about.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wasnt even thinking about it
Aldus Larian (Jess): katsu kinda overpowers it XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: ~~unless you wanna give me chocolate~~
Bill: Yo I could use a mall visit tho.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~yo, go get that edible cookie dough~~
Bill: Are you trying kill me.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): all cookie dough is edible if you're brave enough
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'm brave enough
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that place has like 30 flavors
Bill: Think that cookie dough place is still in Landcaster?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wait... *what?*
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.doughandco.co/
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): can we go
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): **can we go?!?**
Bill: We went on sunday last year.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its pretty close to concenter if i remeber correctly
Bill: Two blocks or so.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OWO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): im shaking
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): we need to go
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fdgjkhsdflk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 5 minute walk
Aldus Larian (Jess): YE
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think i wore the outfit im wearing today, on monday and now i feel weird
N🆗ri (Marisa): cosplay outfit
Aldus Larian (Jess): i did laundry, is clean
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): holy fuck
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yes we do
Aldus Larian (Jess): they reopen the 19th! just in time for zenkai whoo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yay
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): WE GOTTA GO
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i saw that and then check their facebook
N🆗ri (Marisa): i bet they're reopening just for zenkai since it's the biggest money drawing event in the city :3c
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): get ready for the weebs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also because winter officially ends
N🆗ri (Marisa): o yeah the 20th
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH i think dairy queen has free ice cream the 20th
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so they open a day early! 😃
N🆗ri (Marisa): the reason so many businesses partner with the con and offer reduced rates is we bring like millions of dollars to the city for the weekend. or at least hundreds of thousands. idk but it's definitely confirmed the biggest moolah making event in lancaster for local businesses
N🆗ri (Marisa): which is a little sad for lancaster?
N🆗ri (Marisa): but that's the power of weebs?
N🆗ri (Marisa): otakon leaving baltimore like devastated their economy
Aldus Larian (Jess): rippp
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Amazing power of weebs
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And they repay us by
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Treating us like trash!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Neeto
Aldus Larian (Jess): i hope i dont get made fun of in the coffee shop again
N🆗ri (Marisa): most of the comments about most of the lobby shutting down were "does this mean locals can't film and harass us in the lobby anymore" rip
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~they have good coffee~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The picket people will still be there tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg all night the con heads were arguing over where to put the concession stand now. like, forget the staff schedules! who cares about important decisions that impact everybody! we gotta argue over this food stand!
N🆗ri (Marisa): every convention has picket people <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i dont understand?? like theres literally and art college on the same street that i KNOW weebs and people with brightly died hair attend like arnt they more used to this by now
N🆗ri (Marisa): we gotta pull that scanty and kneesocks stunt from that midwest con years back
Bill: ?
N🆗ri (Marisa): that iconic y'know
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): cosplaying demons wihle pulling up in front of westboro churchers to a huge cheering crowd in a stretch limo
N🆗ri (Marisa): people brought a red carpet for them too
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH MY GOD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i fucking love cosplayers
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://youtu.be/iSltz8z0p8w?t=22
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dont see understand why they think people wearing costumes would impede their ability to believe in god
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Truth
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a whole write up about it here it's a fantastic and awe-inspiring story
https://www.deviantart.com/the-sushi-monster/journal/Story-of-Putting-on-Kneesock-and-Limo-Prank-218288915
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): holy shit
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i want to be them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): are they actually there to protest the con? because their signs never seem to directly call out cosplaying. always just seems like a generic protest? idk if they exclusively come out for the con or if it's a regular thing they do. I don't frequent downtown Lancaster on a regular basis
N🆗ri (Marisa): a big reason people protest is because they think we're full of Sin™ and our time would be better spent repenting and begging for forgiveness. the protestors are often jobless so have nothing better to do and are usually recovering drug/alcohol addicts who replaced their bad addiction with an addiction to the church.

yeah it's not necessarily protesting the convention, they're always there, though there are protesters at every convention. it's not cosplaying, it's spending so much time and money on cartoons and dressing up as/"worshipping" fake idols instead of being a good god worshipper, and not donating our money to the church
N🆗ri (Marisa): plus anime has all that magic and demons and stuff that rots your brain
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ah gotcha
N🆗ri (Marisa): and those who aren't shouting or harassing anyone are likely there because there's a lot of people and it's easier to get their message across when there's a lot of people to see it. those people aren't trying to force anything on anyone, they're just hoping that maybe every one in a thousand people will see their sign and resonate with its message, and at a con that draws thousands of people the chances of that happening are higher
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because like, I saw that guy last year and like, I didn't see any problem with him necessarily being there doing his thing. Like, okay, call to repentance, whatever. As long as he's not outright telling people they're going to hell and shit. But I remember Gen's group went over to him to intentionally heckle him last year and I was like, uhhh if he's not explicitly calling out cosplayers, is that really necessary?
N🆗ri (Marisa): mmmmmmmmmmyeah the cosplayers can be the problem sometimes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like I feel that cosplayers automatically assume they're there because of them?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but like you said, I feel like they're just using a big event to try to spread their message to as many people as possible with hopes that *someone* might listen to them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): although I did see the material he was handing out and it was a bit... *extreme*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just the way it was worded
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeahhhh. some cosplayers tend to adopt the whole "social outcast/misfit" ideology and believe they're different from "normal" folk. convention goers do tend to contain a large amount of socially awkward people who may have been bullied, and nerds have a deeply ingrained reputation of being the underdog even though that's been changing since at least 1977, so I can see how they'd quickly jump to the conclusion that the protesters are there just for them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, reading through the guilt-tripping language I was like "Okay, this is pretty much just things we acknowledge and practice at Mass"
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive only noticed it at zenkai 🤔
Aldus Larian (Jess): so far at lest
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): anime boston is really bad with it. at least the years i went
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the protesters actively calling out cosplayers as they walked by
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've seen it at anime expo, animenext when it was in north jersey, animeusa big time, otakon in both baltimore and DC (omg the guy with the megaphone in dc was really awful i think they eventually arrested him? he was so hateful), nycc, every 'big' con.
N🆗ri (Marisa): this year was the first year i ever left the gaylord at katsu so idk about there
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I didn't see any
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): me neither
N🆗ri (Marisa): ah there's video of them at katsu on youtube. it's from a few years ago though
N🆗ri (Marisa): one of vic mafgshtdjh confronting them in 2016 and a few of somebody throwing water balloons at them in 2008
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My thoughts are honestly just ignore them. Heckling and taunting them (regardless if they're heckling or taunting cosplayers) doesn't make you a better person
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): agreed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): however this panty and stocking prank is pretty funny...(mostly because its the westboro baptist church, which is the most toxic place to begin with, and they also werent doing anything to really heckle back)
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I think most people feel that way
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~not the gillie crew apparently~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): wasn't it mostly coincidental?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah not the ghillie crew
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's been ages since i last read it but the limo was supposed to be smaller, and due to a mix-up the company upgraded them to their biggest stretch limo for free, and then the limo driver couldn't find anywhere to drop them off because staff kept pointing them in different directions so finally they got quickly dropped off at the truck loading dock which is where the protesters were
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I was waiting for Leanna to post a link to the Panty and Stocking prank lol~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think
N🆗ri (Marisa): i posted it above!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea from what i read in that post you sent, they intended to do the entrance when the protesters started, but they never intended to heckle them or cause any harm
N🆗ri (Marisa): the video shows it and the deviantart link explains the whole story
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooo ye that makes sense. just do an entrance
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~oh whoops~~
Bill: Maybe I should actually go to one of these meetup suggestions.
N🆗ri (Marisa): go go go
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna learn history the way it used to be taught.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i found a book i don't have that'd really help with the kogaracon presentation but i can't find a free pdf of it online <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~are you asking for help finding it~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've searched.
maybe i should try the temple library and see if they have it online
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw darn there's just a review for it
N🆗ri (Marisa): all the journal articles on the subject i've read lol rip
Bill: I thought you were doing trivia.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no? i'm doing history
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH YEA YOUR PANEL
Aldus Larian (Jess): i go

N🆗ri (Marisa): i can make a presentation but it's nice to have sources to back up my wild claims
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): it bore
Bill: And I'm actually going to watch you in the contest this time!
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh am i entering the contest
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was just gonna wear an old homestuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): no it good, if you need someone to pass otu stuff or something i can help
N🆗ri (Marisa): pass out the test at the end <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: boo homestuck, do something contestable.

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wait
N🆗ri (Marisa): homestuck is super contestable

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ooo yeeee
N🆗ri (Marisa): what was i doin
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yah
N🆗ri (Marisa): i might buy that book on amazon
N🆗ri (Marisa): the main issue is there's so much idk where to start. i keep going "ok we're gonna start in this year with this work. but how do we define anime/manga? because if we define it this way we start in this year. if we define it that way we start 200 years earlier. if we define it another way we've got about 1800 years of history to cover."
N🆗ri (Marisa): lets just start at the beginning of mankind
N🆗ri (Marisa): history of the world

N🆗ri (Marisa): omg Designed by Jess©
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm just gonna walk to the front of the room, say "vegeta caused the big bang" and then collapse dramatically
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i cosplay jade that's in character because she has narcolepsy let's go
Aldus Larian (Jess): this is for kogara right? oo what should i coaplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): *shoves incomplete zenkai line up under the desk*

N🆗ri (Marisa): tfw no soldier emoji
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh the first suggested after that article was this one:
https://soranews24.com/2018/02/13/survey-reveals-japanese-men-really-want-home-made-chocolate-but-are-women-willing-to-make-it/
N🆗ri (Marisa): *inside the box*
Aldus Larian (Jess): yall wont even buy chocolate for girls but u want then to MAKE it for u?
N🆗ri (Marisa): looks like a tie between V route and jaehee route
Aldus Larian (Jess): now i wanna play vday dlc
Aldus Larian (Jess): imma go to japan and give out homemade chocolate to all the girls
N🆗ri (Marisa): yes pls
N🆗ri (Marisa): there were girls doing that at cosplay events. everyone was giving out valentines day chocolate but some girls would be like "our chocolate is homemade, we have to cut it for you but we have wax paper to carry it in, is that ok? so sorry" and i'd just be on the ground grovelling in front of these superior anime beings
N🆗ri (Marisa): and by "everyone" i mean "every girl"
Aldus Larian (Jess): DAMN
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats insane
Aldus Larian (Jess): they deserve chocolate
Bill: I would not do well in Japan.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ya you would
N🆗ri (Marisa): foreign dude with chocolate that's meets 99% of a girl's criteria
you gotta remember your japanese to meet that other 1%
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg its already 130 and i havent done shiiiit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, question about Japan
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): how difficult would it be get around if you didn't speak a lick of Japanese
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): according to chris its pretty hard, but there are signs with context clues
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): my friend managed somehow but she lived on base most of the time so lots of americans, when shed go to mainland theyd get kinda lost
N🆗ri (Marisa): in tokyo it's super easy
further you get from tokyo or a major tourist hub the harder it gets
N🆗ri (Marisa): or yeah near a base
Aldus Larian (Jess): bring friendly tour guide Marisa!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but also chris is asian so they prob just assumed he was from there, or familiar with it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not a lot of help basically
N🆗ri (Marisa): a lot of foreigners living in tokyo don't speak any english, but places i went to like kawaguchiko (which is still super touristy) had almost no english guidance anywhere
