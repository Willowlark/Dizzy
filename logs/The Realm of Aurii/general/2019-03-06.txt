Bill: Oh. We had a pipe burst.
Aldus Larian (Jess): shit
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that what was in the pipe??
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh god i hope not
Bill: No. But my parents bedroom has a wrecked wall, the front door (pipe was over porch) wall is probably damaged inside, and the basement has yet more damage.
Bill: Did not realize how yikes it was when mom mentioned it earlier.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hope you guys have a mop
Bill: The waters in the walls. We’ve got people here ripping stuff up and setting up fans/dehumidifiers and stuff.
Aldus Larian (Jess): shiiiiit that fucking blows
Bill: But have insurance <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): that was not a pun i swear
Bill: Ye. And the plumber here earlier turned off our heat with the water!
Bill: Dumbass.
Bill: ~~when I move out I’m not getting a house, condo or townhome~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): whatcha gonna get?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): A box
Bill: I mean condo or townhome, not house.
Bill: Apartment seems too expense to be worth it in Jersey.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooooooo it sounded like you weren't gonna get any of those and apartment or box was your only option
or trailer. bojo wants a trailer.
Aldus Larian (Jess): tent
Bill: ~~too boushe for a tent~~
Bill: My bag came though. Is nice.
N🆗ri (Marisa): live in the bag
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My future brother-in-law is selling his van that he lived out of for his first few years out of college.... just a thought
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru's interested
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damn didn't a pipe burst last year too?
Bill: Mmm.... now that you mention it maybe.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the yearly happening! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Bill: New bag filled.
Bill: I don’t really gain any space.
Bill: And fitting the camera itself with a large lens would make it *somehow* hold less than my grandfather’s camera bag.
Bill: Nor can I keep the camera in it with the battery grip on it.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'd live in a van Ngl
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's a piece of garbage but it has so much character. Been all around the US and Mexico
Bill: But that’s... flash, dslr, grip, film camera, spare large lens... a tray with film, flash receiver, go pro, the  two straps...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And it has a pop-top
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats a vacation home on wheels
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The back has a mini fridge and propane stove inside custom built cabinetry and has a futon lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Sign me the fuck up
Bill: I can fit most of my work kit in with the camera gear. Since the strap mount is at work...
Bill: Guess I’m going to NYC tomorrow with my full convention shooting kit.
Aldus Larian (Jess): y tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): Birucon
Aldus Larian (Jess): My foot still hurts from slipping yesterday 😭
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT HAPPENED
N🆗ri (Marisa): did someone injure you I will injure them
Aldus Larian (Jess): I slipped on ice/snow on the stairs and twisted my foot
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Im gonna punch the snow
N🆗ri (Marisa): At least you fell in ice. For your injured foot.
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's gonna be cold
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was limping yesterday and a little today it's a good time
N🆗ri (Marisa): Get tom to carry you everywhere
N🆗ri (Marisa): If our fingernails were teeth would they also need to be brushed three times a day
N🆗ri (Marisa): And if teeth grew like fingernails would we need to trim them or would they naturally file themselves to a reasonable length due to the food we chew
N🆗ri (Marisa): special gloves to protect your finger teeth when typing and using touch screens
N🆗ri (Marisa): Baby fingerteeth and adult fingerteeth
Elfriede Faun (Tom): yes
Bill: Maybe I should carry less stuff damn.
Bill: So we got our last confirmed new guy, whose the one who was hired in Canada But was moving here?
Bill: Real personable.
Bill: The. Backpack strap. Is wider than the strap clip.
Bill: Weird mood.
Aldus Larian (Jess): biru why do you have all our camera stuff with u
Bill: Cause I didn't want to wait till I get home to try the clip out?
Aldus Larian (Jess): the clip was at work?
Bill: yeah, I shipped the clip to work cause no sales tax to an out of state address from Unique Photo.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ah
Bill: There’s a loop on the right strap for something like this, sits higher but I do like that better.
Bill: It should go on the *left* side, cause you hold the camera grip in your right,but this backpack has a phone pocket on that strap.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and to your left we see the wild photographer, equipped with enough resources to last days at a time in the harsh climate of the convention center._
Bill: Also got the thing to stick camera on belt.
Bill: That's not too bad.
Bill: course, shirt falls over that.
Bill: and I haven't tried *any* of this with the battery grip but also meh.
Bill: I should take a walk at lunch but it *cold*.
Bill: I need one *of these babies*
Bill: So to get to my camera... I can swing the bag over my left shoulder and use the side access pocket, use the clip to mount to my shoulder, or use the belt pad and the clip to clip to belt.
Bill: They're all not *fast* but I'm also not an action photographer.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Is that resident evil
Bill: ye.
Bill: Each of these babies can hold *two whole* inventory slots.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Waoooohh
