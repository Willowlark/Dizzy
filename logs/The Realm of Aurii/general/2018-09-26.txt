Nokri (Marisa): トム、説明できる？
Nokri (Marisa): 中二病？
Elfriede (Tom): We went away for work
Elfriede (Tom): Training
Elfriede (Tom): We're learning stuff at a really old lodge the company owns
Dave: あまりにも多くの塩病
Elfriede (Tom): And staying there
Elfriede (Tom): It's haunted
Nokri (Marisa): おお、なるほどトレーニングだね。

Nokri (Marisa): and then dave was murdered by ghosts. the end.
Elfriede (Tom): Rip
Elfriede (Tom): This place is so damn old tho
Elfriede (Tom): Everything is warped
Elfriede (Tom): Each room has 1 outlet and all locks were added later
Elfriede (Tom): But the doors are bowed so much that they don't line up
Nokri (Marisa): so the ghosties can peak in and check up on the guests
Nokri (Marisa): is it a hotel?
Elfriede (Tom): Maybe it used to be
Elfriede (Tom): It was boat or trail only access
Aldus (Jess): I'm surprised they haven't murdered you all yet
Nokri (Marisa): Studying really freaks me out because I don’t know how it works. You just *remember* things? ?? 
I was clueless in a study group yesterday and I was clueless after the study group but ten hours later it clicks and bam krashen’s monitor theory and all its hypotheses are just there in my brain. Freaky.
Elfriede (Tom): Freaky indeed
Nokri (Marisa): The beacon chat is dead and I killed it
Nokri (Marisa): Oh tom saved it were safe again
Elfriede (Tom): WOOO
Elfriede (Tom): Hunter is in class now so he prob can't respond
Elfriede (Tom): At least I think Hunter is a he .. hmm....
Elfriede (Tom): I know Hunter had his boobies removed and likes girls but idk if he's a he.. I think so
Nokri (Marisa): Hunter come back to talk with us we have so many personal and intrusive questions
Elfriede (Tom): 😏
Nokri (Marisa): Are they flying high baby or are they oh my we’re so high up
Elfriede (Tom): OH MY WERE SO HIGH UP ALL DAU
Elfriede (Tom): Im ready to go to the last place I think

Nokri (Marisa): OwO
Elfriede (Tom): West of the obsidian mansion
Nokri (Marisa): I must be silent
Nokri (Marisa): I feel like anything I type could be a spoiler oh man
Nokri (Marisa): Torture
Aldus (Jess): It def took a min for me to figure out that you guys were talking about rune factory's
Nokri (Marisa): It’s his job training
Nokri (Marisa): ~~when u gonna play~~
Aldus (Jess): Maybe when he done
Nokri (Marisa): Tom hurry up and complete game
Nokri (Marisa): Oh no my train stop is coming up and someone is asleep on me help
Nokri (Marisa): Ok she’s on the other person now let us hope she doesn’t switch back
Nokri (Marisa): Nooooooo
Nokri (Marisa): MWOS MY CHANCE
Elfriede (Tom): Ooooof
Bill: I have to write a check today. So I go to my lockbox where my checks are... I have like, 5 checkbooks for Picatinny. I've written maybe 6 checks in my life.
Bill: What the fuck do I need those for.
Bill: Admittedly I got them when I was a kid, but.
Aldus (Jess): i write one (1) check a month
Aldus (Jess): maybe 2 if im getting my hair done
Nokri (Marisa): They look fun. You can get checks with cats on them to gaze at.
Bill: It's also great because I don't use picatinny for anything other than my car payment.
Bill: I keep a bare minimum amount of money in there to keep the account and there's an automatic transfer monthly from Chase with the car payment that gets taken out of the picatinny checking.
Bill: So the checks are even more useless; my money is with Chase.
Bill: ~~which makes me glad they gave me 3 sample checks when I signed up, cause I never ordered chase checks~~
Nokri (Marisa): Ok but you can’t put a little cat next to your name on a direct deposit
Aldus (Jess): our checks have owls!
Nokri (Marisa): i've eaten half of my cookies 😦
Aldus (Jess): uh oooooh
Nokri (Marisa): i wanna draw princess bowser but study
Nokri (Marisa): i'm gonna forego studying to draw bowsette <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): screenshot this for when i flunk out on friday
Aldus (Jess): hmmm i should work and stop looking at houses but damn is it addicting
Bill: My budgets get *completely* destroyed by cons. So many splits and joint transactions, repaid separately...
Bill: Got a good amount of rewards points though!
