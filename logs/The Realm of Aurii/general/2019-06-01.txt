Bill: Weâ€™ll talk about it eventually.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye but it's something I gotta wear walking around da city
Bill: Thatâ€™s 80s look you had at laundromat last time was good and casual!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Heeels thooo
Bill: Did you have heels?
Bill: You could easily just wear vans with an outfit like that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): They are boots I wouldn't want to wear walking for very long
Bill: Aaah
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't have vans <:pew:543202259085950996>

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Congrats?
Bill: And still didnâ€™t get a ticket!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): A lot of times your first time they give you a free pass
Bill: I really should have a speeding ticket by now, yet.
Bill: I got no points on my license so...
Bill: Just being heavy on the gas around a corner is easily just an accident.
Bill: ~~actually just batted my baby blue eyes and got outta it~~
Bill: But Iâ€™m just rather amazed that went the way it did so.
Bill: Iâ€™m a douchey Subaru driver these days. Yâ€™all have gotten tickets for less.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i aint got ticketed yet <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My first time I rolled through a stop sign and the cops were right there. I must have moved my hand in the steering wheel in some way because they thought I was being an ass and waving at them as I rolled through. He was a real jerk about it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i was pulled over once cause i was driving at night and the officer thought i had too tinted windows .-.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i cried abou being pulled over in the 7/11 parking lot after LOL
Bill: Ye Erik, thatâ€™s what should get a pass not going 10 miles over on an entrance ramp.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "Do you know why I pulled you over?"
"Because I didn't come to a complete stop?"
"OR AT ALL"
*Umm, I at least slowed down and there was no one there, but go off I guess*
"Why were you waving to my partner over there?"
"What?"
"You waved at us as you ran that stop sign"
"Uhh... I didn't?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also said I was speeding and thought I was evading them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Meanwhile I'm literally right around the corner from my house
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Them they saw my driving record was spotless and let me off with a warning but I was fucking pissed he was being a dick about it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow what dicks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, this is why people hate cops
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You don't have to be a condescending asshat to assert your authority
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *That makes people respect you less*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea alot of cops judge young men really hard too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): finally an advantage to being a woman lol
