Bill: Le sigh.
Bill: !counter bill-drunk-discording set 1
Dizzy: The bill-drunk-discording count is now 1!
Bill: Had a moment where the app confused me and I thought they changed train schedules.
Bill: That’d have been bad.
Bill: sobering up on the train ride home *sucks*.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: *whats that like* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: I know you're being sarcastic but; its not like I'm super drunk where sobering up leads to headache and loathing. I just have enough of a buzz that coming down from it makes me super tired and just like, *done* with being awake. But because train I can't sleep.
Bill: Shit I’m exhausted. You
Bill: Almost to Dover, where I hop trains for Netcong tho. Nice.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: yeee
Nokri (Marisa): I messed up my work schedule so I have an extra weekend off. Guess I’ll go climb a mountain or something.
Nokri (Marisa): Not this weekend. No mountains tomorrow.
Aldus (Jess): oh noes!
Aldus (Jess): ~~come back home and come to my birthday party~~
Nokri (Marisa): am currently deciding between coming home or travelling the country
home will be twice the cost 😭
Aldus (Jess): na we teleport you
Nokri (Marisa): yes pwease
Nokri (Marisa): flight to either philly or newark is $1500 at its cheapest (that includes the cost to get to the airport)
trip from tokyo > nara > kyoto > osaka > hiroshima > maybe some other places is cheaper. but home. aaaaaaa
Aldus (Jess): ugu thats so spence is that only one way too?
Aldus (Jess): ~~teleport us both to otakon~~
Nokri (Marisa): das round trip, one way is like $800-900
Aldus (Jess): oooo ok still though D:
Aldus (Jess): i can see the appeal of wanting to just travel around there since its a good opportunity to do so
Nokri (Marisa): yeah. like i'm only ever in tokyo and i rarely get to explore that, so i'm considering taking the short break between semesters to check out other parts of the country
Aldus (Jess): yea thats a good idea
Nokri (Marisa): taking the cheap bus though because lots of drama with the shinkansen this week <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): oh yea wow ok i had to google what that was and it was top story
Nokri (Marisa): which one? the hitting the guy and destroying the entire front of the train? <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): the kept going with body parts in the nose
Nokri (Marisa): yuuuuuuuuuuuup
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Nokri (Marisa): they hit a guy in a tunnel (they think it was suicide) and the driver just thought it might've been a small animal. had no idea.
Nokri (Marisa): there was also a stabbing a couple days ago, 1 guy died because someone went crazy with a knife. now they're promoting that the seats can also be used as shields.
Nokri (Marisa): yondu's actor was on the train in front of the stabbing one!
Aldus (Jess): OMG
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Nice!!!
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Oof that's expense 😭
Nokri (Marisa): think of all the cosplay that could buy
Nokri (Marisa): like... 1/2 a suit of full body armor. glorious.
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Ooof yeahhh
Afina (Georgia🍀): (Psst Jess I just saw your Facebook post get the good drink for the partay)
Aldus (Jess): lemonade? XD

Aldus (Jess): it not till monday technically but thank
Afina (Georgia🍀): _i will say it all the days_
Nokri (Marisa): ***happy almost birth***
Afina (Georgia🍀): _its birthday weekend_
Aldus (Jess): <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Afina (Georgia🍀): _like Labor Day but BETTER_
Afina (Georgia🍀): That's why it's only "hap birth" you get more letters as it's closer to the real deal
Aldus (Jess): YEA i might be getting a 4 day weekend but i have to bog my boss about it
Aldus (Jess): OHH NEATO
Afina (Georgia🍀): Owo that sounds rad, BUG EM
Nokri (Marisa): throw your boss into a peat bog for that vacation time
Aldus (Jess): HELL YEA
Afina (Georgia🍀): Just YEET him into one ye
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ok so tomorrow is "happ birth d"
Afina (Georgia🍀): Sunday is "happ birthda"
Afina (Georgia🍀): And Monday will be the full day
Afina (Georgia🍀): Excellent <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus (Jess): WHOOO
Afina (Georgia🍀): So my mom was like "be in at 9:30" and now it is 9:30 and we haven't even left home yet cause she's late lmaoooo
Bill: woke up literally 5 minutes before the morning cadence.
Bill: woo.
Aldus (Jess): #adulting
Bill: this is a little too close for my taste, I had alarms blaring.
Bill: that explains that.
Bill: The clock dial is off on my loud alarm. The alarm hand is right, but the clock is 4 hours behind.
Aldus (Jess): oh boy
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: MMM THIS WEATHER IS PERFECT
Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Dis my favorite weather
Bill: I was just about to say I'm working from the porch today after I shower.
Aldus (Jess): my boss isnt here to approve my time off but his son was like "yea NBD if he gets mad tell him i told you it was ok:"
Bill: neat.
Aldus (Jess): so 4 day B-day weekend WHOOO
Bill: off today too?
Aldus (Jess): no, tuesday
Bill: neat.
Aldus (Jess): ye!
Aldus (Jess): ok planned out all my time off for cons i have 3.5 left over if we only take extra days (besides friday) for katsu
Bill: Do I hear lets take off thursday for colossal as well?
Aldus (Jess): maybe a half day
Bill: depends on when check in is I suppose.
Aldus (Jess): 3 i think?
Bill: but you can use the waterpark under the reservation as long as you check in or out that day. 😏
Aldus (Jess): yea but it gets messy with changing and shit
Afina (Georgia🍀): owo how much was colossalcon coming out to again
Bill: true.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I remember mentions of it being $$$
Bill: We need to figure out whose coming, honestly.
Aldus (Jess): ill keep it at 1 day for now, maybe change to 1.5 after consensus it reached
Bill: Right now it's Me, Dave, Joe, Georgia, Hal, Jess, Tom. Ashley and Dan are potentials, as are trying to get Brandon and Lizi to come.
Afina (Georgia🍀): One room or two?
Bill: two.
Aldus (Jess): honesty i dont think it'll cost more than next if we get 6 in each
Aldus (Jess): and you get water park access
Aldus (Jess): the sheridan costs more than kalahari
Afina (Georgia🍀): Ooooo
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah so it's just cause we have only 4 in the room for now
Aldus (Jess): justin and rayna are also potentials if one of the other couples is a no
Bill: I thought they couldn't get off.
Aldus (Jess): rayna can have off whenever she wants, she is pardiem. Justin said he was going to put in special request becuase no one was "supposed" to take off this week either and someone did
Aldus (Jess): ok i allotted another 1/2 day for colossal even though i said i wouldnt whoops
Bill: we just don't want to be at 7.
Bill: 7 is the worst amount to have.
Aldus (Jess): yeeee
Bill: right now it's 72 a night.
Bill: so 216 a person.
Aldus (Jess): ye lets try to get that down a bit
Bill: one more person is the ideal lowest price though.
Bill: Because of the extra charge for 5th and 6th people.
Bill: The breakdown is up on the page.
Aldus (Jess): i thought we wanted 12?
Aldus (Jess): or you are talking with potentials?
Bill: every 5th and 6th person pays 35 extra a night.
Aldus (Jess): yea i know
Aldus (Jess): so how many do you want total?
Bill: so the split actually gets higher than if you do 4 and 4, cause base price goes up.
Bill: I don't care so much. Assuming we get one of the other couples it's 201. Both couples is same price.
Aldus (Jess): wheres your chart? link pinned in conventions no longer works
Bill: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/10/15/con-shortlist.html
Aldus (Jess): so ideal number is 8 then?
Bill: for cheapest price yet.
Aldus (Jess): 🤔
Aldus (Jess): so in the event we have 12 it would actually be more cost effective to get another room if possible
Bill: good point.
Bill: Doubt we'll have twelve.
Aldus (Jess): who is confirmed? me, you, tom, dave?
Bill: Everyone I said before, asides maybe Joe.
Aldus (Jess): all potentials is 13.
Aldus (Jess): i dont think they will all come though
Bill: yeah.
Aldus (Jess): Me, you, tom, dave, georgia, hal are confirmed then? <@!245270932602486784>
Aldus (Jess): cuz thats 7, one more would fill the 8 person optimal
Bill: I'd ask single friends but you know.
Aldus (Jess): you have single friends they're just all dudes
Bill: fair. None of them have interest in waterparks though.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm confirmed
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hal is basically confirmed, he's not working then and he's back at school
Afina (Georgia🍀): But I don't speak for him
Bill: except when you do kappa.
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😜
Afina (Georgia🍀): Could ask reiley or ryan
Aldus (Jess): nah i get you i just figured he was at work so youd probably have a better idea than me
Aldus (Jess): ~~did rei ever ask you for a ride this weekend?~~
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah they're coming to rocky horror tonight and sleeping over so I don't have to make the extra stop at their house 🙌
Aldus (Jess): yaaaay!
Afina (Georgia🍀): I know reiley is tight for money but they could ask for colossalcon as a birthday gift maybe?
Afina (Georgia🍀): They're are also in the "summer birthday" camp
Aldus (Jess): summer b-days are best! when's rei's?
Afina (Georgia🍀): July 31, two days after mine, we were actually born in the same hospital lol
Aldus (Jess): awww ❤
Afina (Georgia🍀): But yeah we could pitch the idea to them at the party if we really want
Afina (Georgia🍀): And if not, I imagine Ryan would wanna go to ~~as nude as possible~~ swim and drink con
Bill: I mean, are we ignoring the others tho...?
Bill: ~~thank you for asking Jess I needed to do that.~~
Aldus (Jess): yea i dont now how to handle this whole "more people is more money" thing
Aldus (Jess): like solution would be another room but ugh
Aldus (Jess): shoulda got the big 5 yo XD
Bill: They inflate the base price appropriately.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh no I mean to suggest that if we're looking for singles
Afina (Georgia🍀): Idk if we are or not
Bill: right. I'm just don't want to rescind offers already given, I don't find that fair.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah though having people confirm or deny sooner rather than later is probably preferable
Afina (Georgia🍀): This is the next big con for almost everyone, Hal and I being outliers
Aldus (Jess): ye you crazy kids wit your rtx
Afina (Georgia🍀): He wants to do Otakon too
Afina (Georgia🍀): Home boy GON DIE
Aldus (Jess): oof
Aldus (Jess): i think thats virtually impossible
Bill: pretty sure you said if I booked Otakon you'd cave and go.
Aldus (Jess): me? yea i would
Aldus (Jess): whoops
Bill: Georgia, but also true you.
Aldus (Jess): mystic mess ma man. although those lines are gonna suck butt
Afina (Georgia🍀): I mean my family vacation is that Sunday to the next Sunday so I'd have to really beg to be able to go to Otakon
Afina (Georgia🍀): And even then I'd have to drive myself and probably leave Sunday to drive to ~~West Virginia mountain Mama~~ North Carolina
Bill: you didn't have that vacation planed at the time.
Afina (Georgia🍀): True!
Bill: So rei is coming with you tomorrow Georgia?
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeeee
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH FRICK yeah we're rendezvousing with you
Afina (Georgia🍀): Would you be able to take Rei with us? Otherwise I'll just drive straight to Jess
Bill: It's no problem. I'd have been very surprised if you showed up without telling me she was coming though. 😃
Aldus (Jess): OH my dad put a volleyball net over the pool neato
Aldus (Jess): and he got my floats that look like donuts!
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH LIT
Afina (Georgia🍀): oh boy swimsuit time
Afina (Georgia🍀): I'm not physically bikini ready but EmOTIONALLY I AM
Aldus (Jess): Do ettttt, unless you have a one piece that you'll feel more comfortable in
Afina (Georgia🍀): Oh I just mean I need to shave

Eliran (Halim): Ye, hence

Aldus (Jess): OH YEA 😭  i forgots about that cuz were doing fathers day that day
Eliran (Halim): But yeah I really want to go support my son
Eliran (Halim): Plus who knows, meeting him in person gives a chance for more deets
Bill: nah, don't ruin the day with drama.
Eliran (Halim): I wouldn't 
Drama comes out on it's own, especially with friends at late night parties
Bill:
