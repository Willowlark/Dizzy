Bill: Actual seriously though, now that I've gone through them. I need the extra zoom.
Bill: Looks like I need to visit the camera shop and look at some lenses.
Bill: *think I can get 25 hundred bucks from kofi*
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): 
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): LOOK WHAY I FOUND
Eliran (Halim): CLASSIC
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: YUSH
Bill: It‚Äôs one of those falling asleep in the car waiting for the train to get here kind of mornings.
Dizzy: GM posts come out today.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Wooooahhh trippy... I had a dream where Billiam didnt like the timeline sonhe reset it with his god powers and we ended up in a science fiction esque world where the earth go derailed from it's rotation in the solar system so humanity built a giant floating metal structure in space to force Earth into a normal rotation. But we we're all still friends but a year younger... But technology was way more advanced.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Crazy stuff
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Oh and the new rotation caused by the device, caused the sun to set and rise in a spiral.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: The dream was so detailed about the oddest things
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Towards the end we found out that demons exist in this world and Jess had so repellent power where she burned them.
Bill: Is this supposed to be irl or in the game?
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Oh IRL
Bill: Eeeeh....
Bill: Am I haruhi now then...?
Nokri (Marisa): Do the dance
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: **bouken desho desho plays**
Nokri (Marisa): **wrong dance**
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: **technically not a dance tho**
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: **unless aya hirana came up with one separately**
Aldus (Jess): I had fire powers? üòÆ
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Nono more like... Exorcist powers
Aldus (Jess): Sweeeeet
Nokri (Marisa): They got fan dances for it and also haruhi has an old rhythm dance game that has an official version of it. And more songs because everything haruhi needs a song üéµ
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: üôå you right
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Omyygoddd I'm tired
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Most tired I've been in a long time
Aldus (Jess): my coworker is out on business today which means im all alone üôå
Bill: What the fuck is slub.
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Pfft
Bill: I have no idea.
Bill: what does it *mean*
Bill: also the interns are joining the cadence, so we're doing grade A school mandated introductions.
Bill: hey, shit, <@!245270932602486784> the guy who leads the IBM team right now has a physics masters. *and one of the interns*
Bill: what the fuck, none of the people I work with are comp sci, not even Math.
Bill: Chemistry, physics, some engineering.
Bill: Economics, Business...
Bill: *seriously why are they all physics*
Bill: *I'm very confused*
Bill: introductions suck.
Bill: *Aerospace Engineering?*
Bill: We work on a math mathematical model that applies a bunch of functions to data, providing the optimal price based on historical data. 'ie we sold alot of these when they were X price, so sell it around there'. I don't think we have a single math degree.
Bill: If you have a masters or PHD in *something*, I guess IBM will hire you.
Nokri (Marisa): A slub is when your yarn gets wonky and there‚Äôs a random chunky part ü§î
Bill: well. In other news, I got a 30% off coupon for American Eagle, if anyone wants to shop. Online-only items though.
Bill: Chatted with Gord about it, he made some good points.
Nokri (Marisa): gord is a cool name
Nokri (Marisa): like the fruitvegetable
Bill: short for Gordan. It's apparently common in Canada.
Nokri (Marisa): that's not as cool just name the person gord
Bill: rip all my pistachios are gone.
Bill: Vincent, I raised the volume on my headphones to block you out, why are you talking *louder*.
Bill: *Seriously*
Nokri (Marisa): war of attrition
Aldus (Jess): apparently "co worker isnt here" means "jess sits at her desk, writes PBP and plays MM at her desk all day"
Nokri (Marisa): how V seduction going
Bill: ***Viiiiiiiinnnnnnccceeeeeeeeennnnnnttttttt***
Aldus (Jess): OH GOOD. he is V. nice
Aldus (Jess): ~~but i cry everytime i talk to ray RIP me~~
Nokri (Marisa): he so pure
Aldus (Jess): sweet baby boi
Aldus (Jess): i had the scene wear the walked in the garden and it made me sad
Bill: I was talking to Gord about you and mystic messenger, actually. üòà
Aldus (Jess): RIP me
Aldus (Jess): why would you do that?
Bill: Just about mobile games with time requirements to play them.
Bill: We were complaining about ads in games for some reason.
Nokri (Marisa): mystic mess has no games it is pure
Nokri (Marisa): when will the ssum be released for everyone
Aldus (Jess): YA! no ads in MM whoo
Bill: time requirements though. waking up at 2am for fake texts.
Nokri (Marisa): no games = no ads
oops
Nokri (Marisa): just like irl, 2am texts
Aldus (Jess): you dont have to wake up you realise that right?
Bill: I know?
Aldus (Jess): ye, so you dont have too
Nokri (Marisa): if you miss a chatroom they just have it without you
Bill: to play the game without costs and get all the content, you'd need to. The game wants you to do it.
Aldus (Jess): sure. but missing one chatroom a day isnt going to really impede your goal
Nokri (Marisa): it's not until you start missing a majority of chats that it sets you on a bad end because the members don't trust you enough, or don't have enough information on the situation you're in, or haven't had the chance to fill you in on important stuff because you haven't been there to talk to
Aldus (Jess): ye! then unkown shows up and hes like "FINE I GET IT YOU DONT LIKE THIS GAME"
Bill: It's not that you'll lose the game, it's that you want the game content.
Nokri (Marisa): tru
you can also just speed through it in a few minutes and then go back and re-read it later, late night chats are usually the shortest
Nokri (Marisa): oh colossalcon is this weekend? hm.
Aldus (Jess): LETS GO
Bill: YE
Nokri (Marisa): i'm goin to bed now but i'll mock up some sprites tomorrow
if we make a VN we gotta keep everyone's endings hidden from everyone else so it's more fun to have a surprise ending
Bill: Wow okay, I just looked at the photos from the friendaversery compilation. God I don't miss long hair, and Tom looks like he's been fighting monsters in another dimension for 10 years with facial hair.
Aldus (Jess): i want coffee like SO bad but theres people in the lunch room and i do NOT want to do small talk today
Bill: hiss at them if they try to talk to you.
Aldus (Jess): oh good now its only john and hes more introvert then i am
Bill: alternatively, pretend to be on phone call.
Aldus (Jess): im not really supposed to talk on my cell phone at work
Bill: work call.
Aldus (Jess): i dont take work calls on my cell phone
Bill: ah. rip.
Bill: Get headset, pretend it attached to work phone.
Aldus (Jess): that is not worth it
Aldus (Jess): coffee obtained
Dave: https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/31/17412708/canon-film-camera-ended-sales-eos-1v
Bill: Yup.
Bill: is today super slow?
Aldus (Jess): kinda?
Aldus (Jess): morning went p. fast
Bill: suppose.
Aldus (Jess): for me atleast
Bill: maybe I need some coffee...
Bill: I don't like having to submit hours mid week.
Bill: I usually submit friday afternoon or monday morning of the next week, since we have to record all our hours for billable work and such.
Bill: Because it's month end, I have to submit them today.
Bill: *Now I feel like today is friday*
Aldus (Jess): feels like friday D:
Bill: Weird relevance: <@!351785752197201920> Butterfly by swingrowers has great lyrics for a Star AMV. Except that's partially only relevant to <@!245270932602486784> .
Bill: It's like fandoms mixing, but not.
Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): Huh
Bill: yup.
Bill: 
Elfriede (Tom) ‚ôç: Huh
Bill: Man, I met my parents at the wrong theatre.
Bill: Scrub me.
Bill: New York people will never cease to amuse me, feathered pants, a guy with a sassier walk than Ryan, pink hair on a elderly woman...
Dave: NY is great
Bill: Buncha guys at the bar just belted our stand by me with the radio.
Bill: Wheeew plays.
