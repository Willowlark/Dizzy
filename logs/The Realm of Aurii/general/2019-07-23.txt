Aldus Larian (Jess): i hope mawisa ok
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/877765905932753/ fun fact, my elementary school is an apartment building now.
Bill: Mom found a vacancy there this morning.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo nice
Bill: 690 square feet would be too small for my taste... and I’d drive past my parents development every day commuting. 😅
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo ok, not nice then
Bill: But they look nice and I wanna look at them just to see how they converted a school into 20 apartments. XD
Bill: Apparently you aren’t allowed to modify the original building of a school? So I’m super curious.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): imagine taking a girl back to your apartment and banging her in what used to be your kindergarten classroom
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): "i puked right there 20 years ago"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): xD
Bill: *this is where I finger painted and ate glue*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "a kid in my class shat his pants right over there"
Bill: I don’t remember elementary school tho.
Aldus Larian (Jess): at all?
Bill: Nah. Vaguely remember the gym.
Bill: Don’t remember middle school much either.
Bill: I don’t have any friends from those timeframes to reminisce with and I probably repressed a bunch of shit. TLDR weird kid got bullied.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I remember having a substitute teacher in kindergarten and she was teaching us about dinosaurs and asked us "what color were dinosaurs?" and 6-year-old me, thinking back to dinosaur toys I used to play with, said "blue!" and she was like "NO!" and looking back I'm like, *"How the fuck do you know what color dinosaurs were?"*
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): when i was in kendergarten i was going to get sent to the principles office for drawing in my desk but i cried my way out of it, I tried all day to draw a teddy bear and by the time i got it there were like 5 other teddy bears in my desk (like the part u put your books)
Bill: Oh I cried in elementary school once. (I used to have emotions whoo). Over some other kids fighting. Then an eyelash fell on my cheek and the teacher was like “you get to make a wish”. Then I wished the kids would stop fighting. I’m precious.
Bill: Also recall fucking around in kindergarten and the teacher telling to do the work. I told her it was too easy and then when she pushed me I did it immediately. So I was also a dick as s child.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I remember feeling like hot shit in kindergarten because my teacher selected me to draw a poster for our Catholic School's Week game. One of the activity days was each class hosted a game and ours was Pokemon themed so I got to draw a big ass Charizard on a sheet of poster board while everyone else was at nap time
Aldus Larian (Jess): in second grade we had a kid who told me he was going to burn down the school every morning and he made me cry cuz i thought one day hed actually do it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I lost my first tooth on my first day of kindergarten
Aldus Larian (Jess): the weird part was i was never afraid that like i wouldn't make it out i was afraid i wouldn't be able to take me matching Crayola back pack and lunchbox with me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): priorities
Aldus Larian (Jess): that kid was mean af to me
Aldus Larian (Jess): i puked one morning and he made fun of me
Aldus Larian (Jess): luckily he wasnt in my classroom most of the time because he was in remedial classes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): once I was supposed to go to a friend's house for a sleepover but I got sick and my mom said if I was too sick to miss school then I was too sick to go to his house so I went to school to prove I wasn't too sick to go to his house and then I threw up and had to come home and he invited another kid over and gave him Pokemon cards he said he was going to give to me 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): NOOO
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): im cry for 6 yr old erik
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think that was like 1st or 2nd grade
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh we had kids in like remedial reading classes too. The service came in like an RV that was basically a travelling classroom I guess? And these kids would go take remedial reading lessons with this old lady. I didn't realize what it was at first and wondered when I was gonna get to "go to the van" and looking back that seems really shady
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oof that's a horror story
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Missed out on them sweet cards
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA i always thought the remedial kids were like having fun while the rest of us had to learn
Aldus Larian (Jess): or the speech kids
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's how they got you to think they were special and not dumb lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was like "when do i get to go to talking class?"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 1st grade our teacher had us do creative writing
Bill: Yo we should bust out lackey again.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I remember having a brain fart and not remembering how to spell the word "of" and wrote it as "uv", knowing full well that it was wrong lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): i remeber having like one meeting with the speech teacher, trying to convince them i needed it and they were like "no you dont, you speak just fine"
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea! our school always did this thing where you'd have to write diary entries from someone living in whatever time period we were learning about
Aldus Larian (Jess): my dad used to help me weather the paper with tea and burn marks and it was sweet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh that's cool
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Sneasel Deck Incoming
Aldus Larian (Jess): one time we were learning about the french revolution,  i got extra credit cuz i wrote viva la revelucion, cuz i knew it from a song
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Woooah
Aldus Larian (Jess): i felt like hot shit that day
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): We didn't have that, but in high school we had a project like that where we had to tell a story from the perspective of a slave living during the civil war period. Not sure if that's racist at all but I tried tie in that I had an Uncle Ben who used to make really good rice and an Aunt Jemima who made really good pancakes. My teacher thought it was clever but I got points off because of historical inaccuracy because those foods were a commodity slaves wouldn't be able to afford lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): ommggg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 2nd grade we had JOT books that like for the last half hour of the day we'd write in
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh yea! i vaguely remember that?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and JOT stood for "Just Ordinary Thoughts" (not sure if that was universal or something clever my teacher came up with)
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think ours were "journals"
Aldus Larian (Jess): I had them in my senior English class too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): probably something my teacher came up with
Bill: Never heard of any of that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but was a good way of teaching what the word "jot" meant, like "to jot something down"
El🆓de Faun (Tom): Oo I was the only one to guess that the short wide jar had more volume then the tall skinny jar
El🆓de Faun (Tom): In the whole class
El🆓de Faun (Tom): That was my hot shit day
Bill: > Today is an Armonk day
> To be here by 9:30 you would have had to be up at 7 earliest 
> Your message saying WFH was dated 9:30
> You clearly had no intention of coming in at all

Bill: ~~I'm aware that's like, way outside of the scope of the typical gift~~
Bill: Anyway, I'm also *just* as difficult to gift for as my Dad is cause I buy what I want so. I'll try to not do that around Xmas time. XD

Bill: There’s a cute trio at the bar in chili’s, of course when I’m out with parents. Two girls and a guy and the girl whose kinda cute is next to the girl in the middle. So if the guy is dating one of them, probably not the cute one.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe he's dating both of them
Bill: If this was a con it’d be a good chance.
Bill: But then I’d expect him to be in the middle.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Maybe ine then is the cute girls girlfriend and the others her boyfriend
Bill: Not that I know how to talk to strangers at a bar lol
Bill: Maybe.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe they're just really good platonic friends <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: The point is there’s decent odds the girl ISNT dating the guy in the group XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whatchu Gon do about it 👀
