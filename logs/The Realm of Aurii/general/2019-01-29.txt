Bill: that's a cool coin.
Bill: Pinterest has a million and a half posts it refers to as fashionable, yet I never see that fashion on the streets.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): idk about you but I see people dressed like this every single day
Bill: I mean like, the normal stuff.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Half the people at work dress like this
Bill: Okay, now that I said that I see like half of these outfits are tagged 'korean' so maybe my taste in fashion is korean.
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Makes sense. Japanese fashion is a lot cooler than us fashion imo
So fashionable
Bill: is true.
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): K fashion is the best ğŸ‘Œ
Bill: it is V cute.
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Layers and over sized clothes that are gender neutral ğŸ‘Œ
Bill: not exactly what I'm seeing but somewhat!
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Street  k fashion is very straight not confirming clothes.
Bill: 
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Business somewhat follows the same lines. Although women wear more skirts and blouses. But nothing is very "tight" or revealing
Bill: I see quite a bit like that with "Korean" in the tagline.
The Dad Next Door (Swolfy): Yeah it's good taste ğŸ‘Œ
Bill: ğŸ‘Œ
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Makes sense. Japanese fashion is a lot cooler than us fashion imo
So fashionable
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): Why my app glitchinâ€™ out
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): ğŸ‘Œ
NğŸ†—ri (Marisa): I have that jacket in pink though and itâ€™s very cheap. I assume the actual brand is nice but the ones sold online feel like they could fall apart at any moment
Bill: lol they may be cheap.
Bill: Probably why I never see them.
