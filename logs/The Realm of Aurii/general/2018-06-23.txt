Afina (Georgia🍀): #sussex county memes
Aldus (Jess): also its a technical school so people have "shops" they were so divided by sex (like even worse than we went there) there was 2 guys in culinary, 2 guys in commercial art, and 2 guys in graphic design besides that the shops were almost completely divided by sex. Theatre Arts has no guys at all, Medical has 1 guy, all the other guys were in Automotive, HVAC, Welding, Electrical, Electronics and other male dominated trades. Business Administration had one guy
Afina (Georgia🍀): 😮
Afina (Georgia🍀): dayum
Aldus (Jess): and not one of the male dominated trades had a single girl

Bill: I had three teachers in 4 years, you didn’t think the shop was doing well did you?
Aldus (Jess): true
Aldus (Jess): its just like an important feild so i was like what?
Bill: I was pretty much the only one to get any of the certificates we were supposed to get.
Aldus (Jess): NICE
Aldus (Jess): even agriculture was all women? like my class it was all guys
Nokri (Marisa): i was one of 2 girls in my woodshop class and someone kept stealing my stuff so after talking to the computer graphics teacher the woodshop teacher just had me sit at a computer and restore a bunch of old family pictures that were damaged

Nokri (Marisa): rose and i are gonna try to go to a cosplay studio tomorrow because we have a coupon we want to use. we're going to the one in ikebukuro but there's one down in ota that has a swimsuit-OK section that might be cool for summer
Nokri (Marisa): i don't have any good cosplays for this studio i'm gonna waste all my time in the classroom area hhh
Aldus (Jess): What's a cosplay studio?! 😮😮😮 That wounds amazing
Nokri (Marisa): it is! I've only been to one (two? questionably), it was tiny but this one is bigger (and there's an even bigger one I want to go too).
It's basically a bunch of settings and backdrops for cosplay all in one building!
Nokri (Marisa): this is where we're going tomorrow, the 6th floor has an idol stage and changing rooms and the fifth floor has all these spaces. you can also rent props and camera gear
http://hacostadium.com/ikebukuro/floor/5f.html#03
Aldus (Jess): That's amazing 😮😮😮😮👌🙌👌🙌🙌👌
Aldus (Jess): Omg have fun!
Nokri (Marisa): thank! assuming we can get in. I don't see any reason why we wouldn't but i'm always paranoid and a free day seems too good to be true despite having a coupon and reading all the small print @_@

usually for this studio it's $5 for an hour, or between $25-45 for a whole day depending on what day you go (or $19-30 for 5 hours)
Aldus (Jess): That's so cool! I wanna go, Take me
Bill: Mm, those are neat.
Nokri (Marisa): COSPLAY STUDIO FIELD TRIP LETS GO
Nokri (Marisa): biru u would like it too they have a ton of stuff to rent like lights, strobes, camera batteries, camera remotes, filters etc
