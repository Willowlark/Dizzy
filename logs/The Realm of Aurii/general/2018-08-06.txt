Elfriede (Tom): Woo, wut a day, but hey we passed a thing
Nokri (Marisa): Are Georgia and Hal ride sharing back to New Jersey in a rickshaw
Nokri (Marisa): I hope so
Afina (Georgia🍀): that me house!
Aldus (Jess): On our way home we passed a sign pointing right for Marlboro and left for Starbucks and I thought that Hal would have some big decisions to make there
Nokri (Marisa): would it look like this
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> you up by now; do I post spoilers for MM (Ray being Sevens brudder) for the sake of funny Instagram comment, or do I be boring and not spoil.
Bill: Fun fact: selfcest is auto corrected to self esteem.
Nokri (Marisa): *do it*
Anyone who doesn’t know by now probably has no interest in MM
Bill: We hired someone, they start in september.
Bill: Jane.
Bill: Gord forgot to tell me this a week ago.
Aldus (Jess): sounds fake but ok
Nokri (Marisa): is she a homestuck
Bill: Unlikely.
Aldus (Jess): ugh i gotta work but i wanna make memes
Bill: I wanna go to Ota...!
Bill: I looked, can get rooms, not the cheapest, but nearby and under 200 a person for the weekend. It'd be expense but coonnnnnn
Bill: *Jess cave to go meet the mystic mess bois*
Aldus (Jess): hnngggg
Aldus (Jess): badges are 100 too thou
Bill: ~~and parking is also stupid expensive in DC~~
Aldus (Jess): and its only gonna be 200 a person if we get enough people, and yea parking too
Aldus (Jess): and 6+ hour drive
Bill: It was like, 650ish for de room, that's pretty close...
Aldus (Jess): so you're basing it on 4 people?
Bill: >.>
Bill: <.<
Bill: Nope.
Aldus (Jess): 3?
Bill: Who else has disposable income, a job they can get time off from on short notice, and would make the trip?
Bill: Dave won't do the trip, likely.
Aldus (Jess): its kind too short notice for me to take off
Bill: *aaand* not worth the trip down for saturday and half of sunday...
Aldus (Jess): unless i play sick but im not really a fan of that...
Aldus (Jess): unless we went down thursday night but ugh im going to really anxouis
Bill: I'd figure it'd be thursday night going down.
Bill: only way to make the long cons (*ha*) worth it.
Aldus (Jess): ~~MM panel is at 2:00 on saturday~~
Bill: It's like, *really* stupid, but *aaaaaah*
Aldus (Jess): and we had plans for saturday and id feel like an asshole
Bill: They can play pogo in Washington.
Aldus (Jess): since i commited to that like month ago and then to be like "fuck you im going to otakon
Aldus (Jess): its more bailing on people id feel like an ass about
Bill: It's not bailing if we bring em with us.
Aldus (Jess): ok tru...but idk
Bill: Like I said, *totally* stupid. But would be *worth*.
Aldus (Jess): idk man i feel like it would be so much stress at this point 😭
Bill: It's *doable*.
Bill: Just... stupid enough I'd need backing of other crazy people to get myself on board.
Aldus (Jess): i know its doable its just im not good with last minute stuff
Aldus (Jess): it would cost my entire paycheck and probably then some too
Bill: *yeet*
Aldus (Jess): idk if we should financially
Afina (Georgia🍀): Hal wants to go for Saturday
Bill: (you can just say no you know)
Bill: I recall. Tis moot in the big picture.
Afina (Georgia🍀): I think Friday too but _im tryna convince him out of it_
Aldus (Jess): half of me wants to do it
Bill: *right*
Bill: I need like, *the sign* to sway the other half on board.
Afina (Georgia🍀): _hes whittling me down to go on Saturday tho_
Bill: ~~like you weren't going to go~~
Bill: You were the one who originally wanted to do Otakon despite RTX.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Yeah but then I became ***rational***
Afina (Georgia🍀): He's unrationalizing me
Bill: Au contrar. You just didn't want to go alone.
Aldus (Jess): i highly doubt toms gpoing to be up for it
Bill: We both know he loves getting a chance to cosplay tho...
Bill: Also Otakon is the *best* shopping convention on the east coast, Dave would lose himself for days...
Aldus (Jess): but he despises long car trips, he doesnt ussualy buy much at cons
Aldus (Jess): oh i mean tom not dave
Bill: Ye, Ota also has the community aspects that we go for. Cosplay, meetups, etc. It'll *definitely* have a Tekken tourney, among other games...
Aldus (Jess): ughh
Aldus (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>  stop this madness
Bill: *please* It's tearing me apart.
Bill: *He ignored us*
Aldus (Jess): Are you surprised
Bill: *He can't do that*
Bill: *Do remember it's post day*
Bill: But seriously Tomu. Neither of us are convinced completely.
Aldus (Jess): i think he feels same way just a little less opn the lets go side cuz im totally being swayed by mystic messenger ngl
Elfriede (Tom): Not that o would mind another con
Elfriede (Tom): But it's not worth it
Bill: Ota is good shit. Like Katsu without the hellish crowds and more to do.
Aldus (Jess): 😭
Bill: I suppose LCAC exists, but Ryan did say meh to it.
Aldus (Jess): Damn I am feeling that con withdraw tho after watching everyone at rtx 😂
