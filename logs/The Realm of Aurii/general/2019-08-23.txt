Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I actually kinda like the one with the hood
Nokri (Marisa): i'm still debating whether or not to put hoods on them. maybe some will have hoods and some wont <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Nokri (Marisa): i like this dark red color but there are so many colors ahhh
Nokri (Marisa): we have white already but it's very textured fur, like circular kind of. so that might be the test fabric.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Das a good color. I vote for that one
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Oh I love that red one
Tikur (Kurtis): Same! It's quality
Nokri (Marisa): *don't say things to appease me, tell me the colors you like in your hearts*
Aldus Larian (Jess): im generally not a huge fan of fur but i do like in white for that fancy winter feel! also hood are the gud gud
Kaio Vermino (Lee): You should make a couple with like a galaxy cotton exterior and either a white fur inside or black fur
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Or even like dark blue
Nokri (Marisa): **space fur**
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@!245270932602486784>  do you have your ears pierced?

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üê∏üçµ
Bill: Nah he‚Äôs just. Hardcore.
Tikur (Kurtis): https://media.tenor.com/images/a53bf8edf2023e9694677e929d7e31f9/tenor.gif
Bill: üòë
Bill: Leveled tho.
Tikur (Kurtis): Refer to previous message
Tikur (Kurtis): My guy, the first time a bunch of us played, he went hard like it was his job.
Bill: Hardcore.
Tikur (Kurtis): To a bunch of newbies....
Bill: Never left the house after d&d before.
Bill: Kinda sad.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): "Ma chere Monsieurs and Mademoiselles, it is with deepest pride
And greatest pleasure that we welcome you today, and now we invite you to relax, and enjoy y'all's mornings
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "relax" <:exhausted:577177500153544724>
Tikur (Kurtis): I read this whole thing in a French accent and gotta say, y'all is wierd to say with that accent.
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Lmao
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): You aull
Bill: so tired.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Y‚Äôall in a French accent probably just sounds like choking
Tikur (Kurtis): Can confirm
Bill: Maybe I should go to the karaoke thing tonight, just to not do more apartment stuff. Not that I don't enjoy perfecting the place, but I should take a break at some point.
Bill: Or I can just play one of the 8 systems hooked up to the TV.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _go be social_
Bill: The last time I went to Recess alone to be social I sat in the corner, talked to no one for 45 minutes, got way too depressed to IMAGINE talking to anyone, and left.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do karaoke
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ok so sometimes, I go to the grocery store, and I congratulate myself for buying healthy food
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When the reality is, to be healthy, I gotta eat it later
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Going to the karaoke doesn‚Äôt make you social, you gotta talk to people there
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You wanna meet people you say, gotta go out fam
Bill: Down extrovert. I'd like to have a stress free night more than that.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): When da last time you went out tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And going out with family doesn‚Äôt count
Bill: Last friday? Then the first weekend in August.
Aldus Larian (Jess): if you're gonna get stressy from going out alone tho then maybe you shouldn't try to force yourself?
Bill: Yeah, that's why I wasn't going to.
Bill: If I wanna I'll go, if I don't couch and video games sounds *great*.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ü§î
Bill: Different people Georgia.
Bill: I have a meeting to join and I'll be sharing my screen so ttyl
Nokri (Marisa): hi meeting people
Bill: One person.
Nokri (Marisa): hi meeting person
Bill: Got a message from someone else mid meeting about a bug, but he fixed it himself while I finished my meeting! <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@!351471675843411978> what kind of tablet do you have?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have a wacom bamboo for my computer and a galaxy tab4 with s pen
Bill: I thought you ditched the bamboo?
Aldus Larian (Jess): we got a new one
Bill: ah, I thought you just got the tab4. Nice.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea the tom wanted the wacom
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): okie
Bill: *the tom*
Aldus Larian (Jess): but we both use
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMAO opps
Nokri (Marisa): Bamboo is good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): just curious in case I end up needing a new tablet because it'd be neat to be able to draw with it
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): That me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): battery replacement kit was *supposed* to come today, but I think it's delayed
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think they are making a new tab 5 but i dont know if its going to have the pen
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SM-P200-International-Version-Warranty/dp/B07TS2N27S/ref=asc_df_B07TS2N27S/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=366288502003&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17793303113052163934&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003734&hvtargid=aud-801381245258:pla-787854080302&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74513439485&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=366288502003&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17793303113052163934&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003734&hvtargid=aud-801381245258:pla-787854080302
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh god why is it so long
Bill: I'm sure they'll have one. Samsung has been big on pens for years, I have a tablet... somewhere, from college with one. Think it was the early note 10.1.  Plus, they have to compete with apple and the apple pencil.
Aldus Larian (Jess): its a tab A not a tab 4 opps
Bill: ~~Course the Apple pencil only works on newer ipads than mine~~
Bill: Not that I need it, untalented as I am <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Bill: ~~which is a positive thing, I didn't want to feel the need to upgrade my tablet~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh also the white one is $50 cheaper for some reason so i have that one
Bill: Oh good, it's a full size pen.
Bill: The tablet I used to have had like, a DS stylus size one.
Bill: Was oof.
Bill: ~~remembers my surface exists~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): eh i wouldnt say its full size but its bigger than a ds stylus
Nokri (Marisa): Oh woah fancy
If you just need a drawing tablet amazon has them for like $20
Bill: Rip.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have a drawing tablet. I'm talking about like, a tablet tablet
Nokri (Marisa): Ooooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have a smoller Galaxy tab that I bought in 2015 but it started to run really slow. Then my ex bought me a nicer one because I mentioned it *once*. She used to buy me expensive shit for no reason and I felt bad
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but no hard feeling anymore üôÇ
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~that's how I got my xbox too, but it was her old one and she bought a new one~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she was wack with her money
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo nicu!
Aldus Larian (Jess): i mean not nice for her but nise for u
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~probably why she was broke towards the end of our relationship~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~which is probably why she ended things with me. I don't know anything about the dude she married 5 weeks later, but seeing as they met up in Vegas, I wouldn't be surprised if she did it for his money~~
Bill: Her loss, our gain. <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): exactly!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wouldn't have met y'all and probably wouldn't be cosplaying if she and I were still together
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): we'd be married, struggling with custody rights from her first kid, struggling with probably another kid, in a dumpy house in Berks County with 1 bathroom üôÉ
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): boy I really dodged a goddamn missile on that one
Bill: Yay I was able to login to my surface!
Bill: And apparently I system restored it?
Bill: *queues up a year and a half of updates*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I noticed that I'm not as hungry today? Like it's after 1 and I still haven't eaten lunch and usually I'm starving by like, 11

There are 2 factors that could be causing it. First, I usually eat cereal after I shower so roughly 6:40am I'm eating breakfast. Today I got something at Wawa and ate when I got to my desk around 8am. So time difference is one factor. The next is food content. My cereal is basically all carbs, but today I got a BEC bagel so the bagel part is carbs, but the bacon, egg, and cheese is more fat/protein based. So not exactly sure which of the two is more contributing to that ü§î
Bill: Fat keeps you from getting hungry. Protein keep your muscles fueled. Carbs are for energy. Time difference could play a part in that.
Bill: Also, I read it first as you eat cereal *in* the shower and I was concerned.
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa
Aldus Larian (Jess): i just ate my first food now lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): energy/satisfaction from simple carbs burns quick also
Bill: mhmm.
Bill: https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-1-16GB/dp/B008M4K5MY?th=1 I had this one at the start of college.
Bill: Android is now on version 10, this was shipped with 4. XD
Bill: I gotta ditch drop box.
Bill: It's got a two device limit or something like that and that's proving to be an issue.
Bill: Cause I keep my encrypted password file on there and I need that one any device I sign into stuff with.
Bill: My synology has file sync in the same way, which should work. Woo private cloud. But I started the mass copy from Dad's synology to mine last night while I was at D&D, and until I switch everything over I shouldn't modify anything (cause it won't get included in the already started copy)...
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~wtf is a synology~~
Bill: NAS.
Bill: err.
Bill: I realize that's not at ALL helpful lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): private server?
Bill: Network Access Storage. It's a redundant file server for the entire network it's on. Mine's about 20 TB and has pretty much everything, Lightroom files, my video collection, music... (I don't have near 20 TB yet, just future proofing).

Synology is a specific brand of NAS that comes with basically private server software. So it can be an email server, file sync (IE dropbox), virtualization host, media server... etc.
Aldus Larian (Jess): so it's a private server?
Bill: Pretty much.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ok
Bill: Long story short, I can migrate everything to work off of that once I set it up on my network at the apartment.
Bill: I *might* even be able to run Dizzy off of it.
Bill: Which saves me paying Amazon for hosting.
Bill: Gotta look into that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hrmm... I think if the battery replacement in my tablet doesn't work, I'm gonna hold off on getting a new one and get a new TV for my apartment instead
ElüÜìde Faun (Tom): Not a bad idea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): TVs are cheap compared to tablets
Bill: Don't get it immediately. See what you have looks like where it is, and how much more room you'll have to play with, before you buy.
Tikur (Kurtis): Buy it right now. Impulse buy the shit out of it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah planning on waiting until after I move in. there's a TV stand at Walmart I kind of want but the first thing I want to do when I move in is furniture and then work around that
Bill: Pretty much what I did.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): gotta figure out best layout for furniture too
Nokri (Marisa): woah that's huge
pile in the living room!!!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so much fucking closet space too lol
Nokri (Marisa): **closet piles**
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hella closets wooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *that means lots of cosplay storage space
Bill: 
Bill: Organized.
Bill: I'm ditching a bookshelf for the apothecary chest so I used shelves from that and now I've got maximum manga space. üí™
Aldus Larian (Jess): You getting rid of it? <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: yeah.
Bill: It's a 20 dollar wal mart bookshelf.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Didn't you just buy those? Or nah?
Bill: nope. The bookshelves came from my room.
Bill: New furniture is the tv stand, coffee table, dining set, and desk.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh desk. need to get one of those too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *to wayfair*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo ok I thought u just got them with the other stuff. If its sturdy and I have room for it I'd take it, we could use more book space
Bill: sectional, everything in the bedroom, cubbies, bookshelves, and other desk in my office came from my or Katy's old room.
Bill: I used all the shelves in it to make additional space on the manga shelf. üòÖ
Bill: 
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ooo ok NVM then
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~firewood~~
Bill: No fire place.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): very much like this desk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ooooo I like that desk too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I found another one that might be a little less bulky
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like the hutch style though because I have a lot of shit that needs shelf space to put it lol
Bill: just be careful with hutches and monitor size.
Bill: I had issues with the hutch on my last desk and that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Currently using a TV as a monitor lol will probably invest in an actual monitor at some point
Andrew: Hmm, not used to having a lunch at work.
Andrew: What to do.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Look at memes for 30 mins
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This was the other desk I liked
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *sort of*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Looking at it again, not so sure now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@351471675843411978> you use Dollar Shave Club shave butter right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I used too yea! Is v. Nice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just switched to the shave lather and boy what a game changer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Leaves your skin cool and refreshed because mint and aloe
Bill: You shaving the leggies Erikku?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Hell yeah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Face
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Gonna maybe do some Kiri tik toks tonight
Kaio Vermino (Lee): <:rapid:607237006539489310>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo nice!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <@334090409389195266> how did you do tik tok in not mirror image?
Kaio Vermino (Lee): Back camera
Kaio Vermino (Lee): And like 5 tries lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Aaaah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They really need to add a flip feature
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's killing me that Taiyang, my most asymmetrical cosplay, is backwards for every video
Kaio Vermino (Lee): You could also save the video and mirror it in another app and then reupload to tiktok
Kaio Vermino (Lee): But that's a pain
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Tik tok in general is a pain lol
Kaio Vermino (Lee): You're not wrong
Bill: I‚Äôd try a shave cream but I don‚Äôt think I have enough stubble to make it worth it. üò≠
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The second of my 3 part videos posted out of sync with the audio so I had to delete pt 2 and 3 and reshoot 2. Tried uploading pt 3 (which was the original saved) but it was barely getting any hits because it was using the saved audio instead of the "use audio" audio so I had to upload it again using the audio from tik tok and mute one of the audios so it would get views
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It still make your face feel gud!
Bill: True, I have a lotion I use after shavin but.
Bill: More to keep me from breaking out.
