I have twelve paragraphs of comments and a handful of feedback I still have to submit to clients BUT IM DONE TEACHING FOR THE WEEK WOOOO
My last lesson was really good. Kids are usually so stubborn but I had the most typical genki sports high school boy who was super tan and plays soccer every day he’s like an anime protagonist. His lesson was about clothes and the dialogue was super girly so we just squealed loudly for like 40 minutes while reciting stuff like this
Nokri (Marisa):
