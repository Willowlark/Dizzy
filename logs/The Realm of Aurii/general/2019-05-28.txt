Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao my coworker just asked someone for a "CVS file"
Aldus Larian (Jess): he means csv but its just funny cuz he always acts like he knows everything

Bill: Lol I forgot the typo that‚Äôs the point of the joke.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao i kinda figured but i was like :o?

Bill: Aaaaah it‚Äôs nice when the company pays for the room, yet I still get nights and points for it.
Bill: ~~I think this suite is the same size as my sisters apartment~~
Bill: And cheaper than every con but Zenkai.
Bill: And. Too much space. Traveling alone is weird.
Bill: Granted I‚Äôm not traveling to do stuff in the evenings so having sitting space is probably going to be nice, but. Weird.
Bill: I feel like I need to take advantage of booze being in walking distance but it‚Äôs *tuesday* and nah.
Bill: And I have no motivation to go walk to get dinner.
Bill: White plains is an odd town.
Bill: It‚Äôs like. Morris town but more spacious but more empty.
Bill: Waitaminute.
Bill: I was going to go buy some beers and go back to my room.
Bill: Err. Never mind.
Bill: All the traffic lights in this town chirp like birds.
Bill: At different speeds and pitches.
Bill: It‚Äôs a trip.
Bill: You know those small midwestern towns someone gets murdered in that have deep running secrets? That‚Äôs the vibe.
Bill: I‚Äôm almost back from dinner and I‚Äôll shut up promise.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh good those make great crime dramas
Tikur (Kurtis): Small town murder vines are the good shit
Bill: So the wine and spirit store down the block for BWW (where I had dinner) actually only had wine and spirits. Good thing this suite has a set of wine glasses.
Bill: Why?
Bill: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
