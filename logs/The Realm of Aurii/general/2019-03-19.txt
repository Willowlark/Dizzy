N🆗ri (Marisa): Whatshername is coming back from Disney tomorrow though I wanna sit quietly behind her and eavesdrop about the rides
Bill: She worked without pay to do it for the morning.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Did u find some space in there to say yourself for the last few hours
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye I know

Aldus Larian (Jess): Nuuuuu!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mawisa no cwy we wove u
N🆗ri (Marisa): Cheesy potato
Aldus Larian (Jess): Potato sound good but crying not good
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have yet to make my Irish potato
N🆗ri (Marisa): Suspense
N🆗ri (Marisa): OH i get your question now

N🆗ri (Marisa): sheep eyes are so freaky why are they horizontal
N🆗ri (Marisa): tom get goat contacts for your asriel cosplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's terrifying
N🆗ri (Marisa): if he stares at people while chewing grass it'll really feel authentic
N🆗ri (Marisa): climb some rocks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *crave that mineral*
N🆗ri (Marisa): if there's an afterlife do plants go there too
N🆗ri (Marisa): and fungi
N🆗ri (Marisa): you die and you're just greeted by a 1958 blob-esque mass of all the skin cells you've shed through life
N🆗ri (Marisa): people who keep their nail clippings in a jar do so to appease the nail cell spirits so thbut wait are nails and hair cells dead already or are those alive
N🆗ri (Marisa): nvm they're dead rest in clipped pieces
Elfriede Faun (Tom): GOAT CONTACTS AGHHH NOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): but what if yes
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'll just get cat contacts and pretend they're goat
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And then not wear them cuz I can't wear contacts but eyyyy
N🆗ri (Marisa): but cats have predator eyes and goats have bovine eyes they're totally different
N🆗ri (Marisa): collectors items
N🆗ri (Marisa): "this room contains my goat contact collection"
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *You tryin' to tell me the god of hyper death isn't a predator*
N🆗ri (Marisa): rainbow goat contacts
N🆗ri (Marisa): special order
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess can photoshop them for you omg jess make rainbow goat eyes pls
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: This morning is death.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I started my day by almost showering with a big spider
Bill: Ice. On windshield. Why.
Bill: It maaaarrrrrrrcccccchhhhhhh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): > Instagram: "This post is doing better than 85% of your recent posts. Promote it to reach a wider audience."
> *~checks likes which are lower than most of my recent posts~*
> Insights: "372 accounts reached. 7% weren't following you."
lol yeah okay...
Bill: You use business account?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Bill: Does staying my car in the Armonk parking lot count as going to work?
Bill: Oh my badge is expired again. This happens every 3 months but totally a reason for me to go home right.
Bill: My ezpass statement is Katsu, then all armonk.
Bill: Sad.
N🆗ri (Marisa): How much do I owe you
N🆗ri (Marisa): fyre festival wasn't just people tagging stuff though. it was a massive coordinated advertisement that cost millions of dollars and they were selling an experience <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~the fuck is fyre festival?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg it was a fantastic trainwreck
N🆗ri (Marisa): hold on there's a super abridged youtube video
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBPg5ftCMv8
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There’s a documentary on Netflix lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): a musical festival that was built in a month, broke every promise to its fans, and wound up immensely in debt
N🆗ri (Marisa): the hulu documentary is better because it explains where the money was coming from, whereas netflix's didn't
N🆗ri (Marisa): he had a russian sugarmommy in new york worth billions who kept giving him money that he'd squander in the wrong places
N🆗ri (Marisa): like millions on instagram advertising, most of the models weren't even paid
N🆗ri (Marisa): "luxury villas" on the beach were waterlogged leftover emergency tents from hurricane matthew or whatever the hurricane name was and the beds were wet because it rained
N🆗ri (Marisa): the netflix documentary is more fun to watch though
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm glad Hunter's using Fyre Festival as a business model
Bill: He wants clientele. Which means he needs advertising. Yeah, Instagram and people mentioning/tagging him is advertising. Tag and mention are the same level of advertising though. And having his tagged photos feed filled with photos is not going to do a thing for advertising/fame.
Bill: Also I could sing his praises on instagram, boi still has to pay to travel to 'distant places'.
Bill: Cosplayers are broke guy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Why do I feel like he's tiptoeing into riding off Casey's fame to promote himself...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hhhhhhhhhh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hunter doesn’t have a “user personality” but I think he knows what he’s doin
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean it’s also different considering he sounds like he wants to make a career out of it
Bill: Yeah he’s getting that way. He wants to have other people be his advertising.
Bill: We LITERALLY made fun of the guy whose line was “you shoot rwby? I’ve shot Casey, oh I mean Mangoloo”.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "OMG I didn't even realize she was in my business card! What a coincidence!"
Bill: If he wants a career he needs to advertise for himself, stop shooting with friends, and act like a pro.
Bill: That guy was a pro.
Bill: He’s not making great decisions.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i find it sad that he said people in bne weren't his friends. like i know i'm not his friend but i figured he at least was friends with the rest of bne.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O wait where did he say that
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: I’m a little bitter he has all the bee shoots tho. His rep for them is that good?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i took that to mean annette wasn't his friend
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 2/3 of those bee shoots are a combination of me and Georgia I think lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): he seems very exclusive with his friends and not interested in making new ones
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But yeah, I think he's got a reputation (at least among his friends) of being a bee fanatic so people want to shoot bees with him
Bill: ~~and~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i thought everyone in bne was friends but if that's not true then aurii are my only friends rip~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): friendly reminder when my behavior is annoying to please call me out on it because i find fault with everything in my existence and i can't tell what's over the line anymore
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll provide rewards
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Taking bets on how much Rebecca spends in dealer's hall despite her not wanting to spend money
N🆗ri (Marisa): at least $3
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah hunter has bees for me/Erik and me/rebecca
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nothing else tho, I don’t trust him to shoot Starfire or Lux or Todo tbh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Me/Lissy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Speaking of, I haven’t seen anyone in DE crew post a line up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~I want to avoid matching with Hal at all~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): They're day tripping
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): At least Meg and Lissy are so I'm assuming Hal probably as well
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Working food industry is rough
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ooooh that explains it
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So meg is only wearing jester then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And hal prob doesn’t even know what he’s wearing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): KEWL bumping into hal or meg was super awkward at katsu so that’ll be lessened I guess
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sucks tho, I still like Lissy, she hugged me at Katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~hal just stared at my ass and meg just glared~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~someone make the unfaithful guy meme with you three~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~but Meg is the appalled gf~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Where’s the picture I need to see it again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And _the selfie_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _mmm yes_
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Speaking of Fyre Festival: https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/fyre-festival-t-shirts-merchandise-auction.html?utm_source=tw
Bill: ~~yo I'd still do the bees~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What if you simultaneously did a Raven/Qrow shoot and a Yang/Blake shoot
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and called it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *The Birds and the Bees*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): das incest
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~wasn't necessarily suggesting Raven/Qrow was a a shippy shoot~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~but it *did* kind of come off that way~~
Bill: I already did that joke for eeeeever ago.
Bill: Alright, I'm a bit jealous of all the perceived Hunter/Rebecca attention but I probably made it a bit weird with my soul searching post Katsu, Hunter & bees is a thing, and I have no claim to anyone's time.
Bill: <@!301927856240459777> YOU ARE NOT ANNOYING.
Bill: I'm going to call you out whenever you *say* you are.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna lay down in a dumpster and get crushed by garbage
Bill: Well you can't.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah dumpsters are expensive to rent
Bill: And you have friends in BNE. Not Hunter. ~~Hunter doesn't matter in the long run~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): we gotta work hard to make ur bees the best bees
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hunters moving to va anyway after graduation this year
N🆗ri (Marisa): i know rebecca and jamie and anna but maybe anna hates me after katsu
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Anna loves you
N🆗ri (Marisa): but i suck and she's really cool
Bill: Anna *LOVES* you oh my god.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): You are really cool
N🆗ri (Marisa): no u
Bill: I don't know *ANYONE* whose more in sync with you than Anna.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O is he really
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Gosh why couldn’t have have kidnapped Casey
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hes moving in with his friend whose name escapes me
Bill: Makes sense. He's always wanted to be around them. /shrug
N🆗ri (Marisa): can his placeholder name be bernard
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I understand the analyzing other photographers thing tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I ~~do?~~ did that with Megs Pyrrha right after the break up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I remember once she told me that my sword was inaccurate .-.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I was like ~~ur boobs aren’t accurate~~ oh I see
Bill: what analyzing?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You’re always comparing yourself to rebecca and hunter
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And you said that list of photographers you knew and said you feel like you’re as good as or better than most of them
Bill: I am... ~~But here I'm jealous of you/Erik shooting with other photographers~~
Bill: Which isn't really fair, I got no claim on you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bees is like hunters thing too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): His work is dependent on how much he cares
Bill: You also having to *pay* for this stuff like.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean the money goes to hunters top surgery
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s a big part in paying to me, I don’t really mind supporting where the money goes to, I don’t know what it’s like to have to hide bobbies
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It must suck to wake up every day and hate your body and only be able to “fix” it with multi thousand dollar surgery
Bill: mhmm.
Bill: I'm just... a bit possessive I guess. And calling myself on it rather than ignoring it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ✨Self awareness is good ✨
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hunter isn’t really a friend friend either
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s a friend but I don’t trust him with emotional things
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s just a good chill and chat friend
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): you can be possessive over lots of other people. lots of aurii and bne peeps who need photogs.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, in smaller doses
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I genuinely enjoy like hunters company, he’s fun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I don’t do drug and I’m not THAT high energy
Bill: I am possessive of all of Aurii Marisa. It's a manifestation of trust.
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to start making some voodoo dolls
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~can’t make a voodoo doll without some hair~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): tru
a zenkai harvest <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Ye I know and photoshoots not friendship but. I can't help feeling, specially after like Katsu and stuff...
Bill: so...
Bill: ye.
Bill: Not right, but do.
Bill: ~~No one encourage me or I'll get a cage~~
Bill: *Your hair is probably still somewhere in my room Georgia* <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~can we do a Jumin shoot with said cage?~~
Bill: Speaking of Anna tho... If we spent more time with her, I'd be happy to call her a close friend. The only thing I don't really know is how she'd handle dissenting opinions (like I dunno, I dislike Hunter) that could cause drama. And that's just an Aurii-server thing. She a genuine person overall and while waaaaay too hype for my energy level, she good with me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she has such senpai energy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I'm kind of in the minority and I've been keeping kind of quiet about it, but she kind of annoys me tbh...~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's valid
what part is annoying?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): first, a little too high energy for me. second, often gives me "know-it-all" vibes because she's constantly suggesting to people on how to do things. Idk if that's a valid excuse because it can be helpful. also sometimes gives me attention seeking vibes by constantly posting about how she's making something more difficult for herself than it needs to be? Like, she didn't *need* to make the Shinsou scarf 54 feet long... but she chose to anyway and then made a big deal about it. Idk. It's weird. I've just been getting weird vibes from her since Day 1
N🆗ri (Marisa): that was a really big scarf ya. why didn't she stop before it consumed her life
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like I feel like she's trying too hard to be accepted by the group? even though she clearly already is?
Bill: I see that, but I read it as insecurity.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): could be
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't know her backstory really
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): she just was there all of a sudden
Bill: My running theory is despite being very social she had a very bad experience with friendship somewhere and is desperately trying to prove herself to us.
Bill: She has nothing to prove, certainly not at this point.
Bill: That's why she wants to help all the time. I'd know, I do that myself. "If you're helpful, you are of value and there fore valid." Classic habits for low self esteem.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): To me it just comes off more as unsolicited advice
Bill: It can ye.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~do i do that 🙀 ~~
Bill: no.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like when we were doing cosplay workshop at Georgia's I mentioned sewing my new Tai vest which is made out of pleather and she was like "Well, you won't be able to do that with *your* sewing machine" and I was like... "Umm... pretty sure I can. They make heavy duty needles specifically for that" and she was like "Well just make sure you keep oiling it!" so maybe she just thought I was using a different material than I actually was but I was able to sew my vest even using a normal needle anyway... SO...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It just came off as condescending and I didn't appreciate it
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo ouch
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but everyone seems to love her so maybe I'm just wrong about something
Bill: A bad experience can tint your perception. You can also be entirely correct.
Bill: Certainly people can also just rub you the wrong way. Like, I don't hate Hunter. The things he does annoy me, but he isn't doing anything *wrong*.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee the human brain is weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): From what I've picked up, shes extremely lonely. While shes incredibly social when shes around people. She doesnt really have anyone close to her to hang out with.

What I've found is that lonely people have a way of.... explaining every aspect of their life and how it happened to somehow supplement for lack contact
Bill: ha true.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's not a bad thing but it can get super annoying
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's valid
Bill: With more time actual with us, rather than everything being a special occasion, she can hopefully find solace from her lonliness.
Bill: I wish I actually brought a flask to work tho man.
Bill: Today's mood.
Bill: needs charlie brown as also Aurii.
Tikur (Kurtis): Should I use a gloss spray paint for Romans cane?
Tikur (Kurtis): Or flat?
Bill: I think it the show it was a flat color, but that may be the model quality.
Tikur (Kurtis): Okay 👌
Tikur (Kurtis): Thank
Bill: Dunno if he's more of a shiny guy tho?
Bill: Guess it depends on the look.
Tikur (Kurtis): I'm going shiny cause he a flashy boi
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think Anna is lonely yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s helpful even when she doesn’t need to be
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She let me use her expensive dremmel and just straight up GAVE me airbrush paint
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like... airbrush paint ain’t cheap yo...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I read it as lonely and excited to find a new friend group
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So she feel like she gotta prove herself worthy to keep around
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg irish potatoes have so much sugar
they just *are* sugar
N🆗ri (Marisa): bit of butter. bit of cream cheese. ***four cups of sugar***. bit of vanilla.
