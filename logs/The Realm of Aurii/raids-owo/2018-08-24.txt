Elfriede (Tom): Since I'm gonna be on a business trip for 3 nights maybe I should buy rune factory

Nokri (Marisa): Wow tom that is genius. What a fantastic idea. I wholly concur. Do it
Afina (Georgia🍀): Why does it keep correcting to god

Elfriede (Tom): 😱 😱
Elfriede (Tom): Someone help him
Nokri (Marisa): Get five minutes into the game and then determine if he still needs help
Elfriede (Tom): Rune factory 3 is like double the price
Nokri (Marisa): Double the waifus
Elfriede (Tom): Do there's 3 protags? Do you choose one?
Nokri (Marisa): There only two in RF4. 3rd game has one protagonist and fourth has a boy and a girl. There’s a very interesting question that determines your gender.
Elfriede (Tom): Hmmm
Elfriede (Tom): I'll let that decide then
Elfriede (Tom): I don't mind playing either
Bill: Is this Lux?
Elfriede (Tom): It looks like Janna
Bill: might be.
Bill: Saw a set, didn't recognize any of them.
Bill: The star guardians having different hair colors is confusing.
