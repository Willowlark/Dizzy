Elfriede (Tom): 
Elfriede (Tom): My Machamp is still in the gym near dc
Nokri (Marisa): i am offended by rune factory's placement in this
Elfriede (Tom): They just know stardew and Terraria are superior is all
Elfriede (Tom): Oh man harvest moon didn't even get a spot
Elfriede (Tom): The horror
Nokri (Marisa): this was for crafting games and harvest moon doesn't have crafting aside from Tartan in AWL
tom u sayin some fightin words right now
Nokri (Marisa): perhaps it's just because rune factory's crafting system is confusingly complex
Elfriede (Tom): Although
Elfriede (Tom): There are prob l more that's in rune factory than stardew
Nokri (Marisa): fight me
Elfriede (Tom): L ao why is sub Nautica on here
Nokri (Marisa): i make level 10 pancakes for my dragon friend every day and drag my family into a frozen wasteland for 12 hours to pick up a special rock each morning. that's what rune factory does to people
Nokri (Marisa): that has crafting too
Elfriede (Tom): WHERE'S THE REAL STUFF, WHERES NO MANS SKY
Elfriede (Tom): That also sounds amazing
Nokri (Marisa): you can physically fight a typhoon when it's typhoon weather
i tamed it and put it in my barn
also i've been waiting like 4 in game years for a mushroom monster to drop a special item because i need some of it for crafting and to complete the shipping catalogue *but it won't drop it*
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao, my family has been killing these.musbroom monsters for generations
Elfriede (Tom): Legend has it that one day it'll drop the sacred artifact
Elfriede (Tom): That'll let me upgrade my barn
Elfriede (Tom): -ftaher telling his daughter probably
Nokri (Marisa): i can't even remember what it's for, armor probably or a weapon.
the monster only spawns once on fridays in one area
so if you fight it and it doesn't drop the thing you have to wait until the next friday
i can kill it in one hit my weapon is awesome (specially crafted ;3c) but the waiting is killing me
Nokri (Marisa): *this guy*
Nokri (Marisa): 
Nokri (Marisa): i need at least 4 for weapons alone aaaaaa
so i'll probably ship the first one i find and hope raven starts selling them in her shop one day
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): HOLY SHIT THATS SO ACCURATE
