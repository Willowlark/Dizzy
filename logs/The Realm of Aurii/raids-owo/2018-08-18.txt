Bill: Random: does an Android butt have squish?
Elfriede (Tom): Yes
Elfriede (Tom): At least in nier
Bill: Because Yoko Taro likes women.

Aldus (Jess): Only the girls
Elfriede (Tom): In sure it does you just can't see

Bill: You enjoy that. I’ll take the sad huggable ones.
Aldus (Jess): A2 would kill you don't lie to yourself
Bill: Tbh ye. Now I’m thinking about it, like, she hawt but would I actually get along with her?
Bill: Could probably snark about shit with her.
Bill: But like.
Aldus (Jess): Murder waifu
Elfriede (Tom): The only one that anyone could get along with is 9s let's be honest
Bill: Kinda ye.
Bill: Actually Waifu material is Devola.
Aldus (Jess): ~~why not popula tho?~~
Bill: Devola is like, strong. She’s got personality and some fire to her.
Bill: Popula is a little too... waifu bait? She’s like, stereotypical anime girl.
Elfriede (Tom): Devola is the aggressive one?
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: Curly hair.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah I like popola better then
Bill: Eh, I feel like Devola would be an equal and Popula would be like, housewife.
Bill: Both of which are good.
Aldus (Jess): Popula is the one who who walk devola through the desert thou right?
Bill: Yeah, I LIKE them both. Just Devola if I’m picking one.
Bill: Devola has the more attractive personality to me.
Aldus (Jess): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Aldus (Jess): I did think either if them even have enough screen time in automata for me rightly chose
Bill: I mean, 2B doesn’t show emotion most of the game.
Bill: Unless that’s a thing...
Bill: Idk, waifu’s from a game aren’t like real people.
Aldus (Jess): I feel like I'd have more insight if I played the other game
Bill: They’re completely different.
Aldus (Jess): Never said they weren't
Bill: I know, I’m telling you. I read all the tropes and series information postgame cause obsessed.
Aldus (Jess): All I'm saying is they both seem strong to me just in different ways
Bill: Oh they are.
Aldus (Jess): I've also read those
Bill: Devola’s strong in personality even in normal scenarios.
Aldus (Jess): Idk guess it's been too long since I've played the game
Bill: It’s a character from a game. It’s not like it’s anything beyond “that’s a cool girl”.
