Nokri (Marisa): what kind of stuff would be good to see in the new animal crossing game

there's a lot it'd be cool for them to bring back, like the observatory, summer calisthenics, animals being mean, going inside the lighthouse. and stuff they should add like outdoor gardens (a la happy home designer), a character customization screen (which they might do if they finally implement skin color? which I can't see them delaying any longer), *sidewalks*
