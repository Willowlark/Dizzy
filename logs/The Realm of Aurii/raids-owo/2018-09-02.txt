Nokri (Marisa): He has many talents
Elfriede (Tom): So I brought knight girl to the mansion
Elfriede (Tom): Tbh I wish there was more banter about the ghosts but she ignored most of the stuff
Elfriede (Tom): Just the thing where she teleported away which was halarious
Nokri (Marisa): yay!!! yeah everyone else ignores everything and doesn't react.

Nokri (Marisa): meanwhile clorica would be like "ghost? you mean nap."
Elfriede (Tom): I'm pretty sure like everyone who's ever played this game has made that joke but
Elfriede (Tom): Oh yeah most likely
Nokri (Marisa): a rite of passage
Nokri (Marisa): there's a doll somewhere in the mansion that's good for training if you ever want to level up another weapon, you can just wail on it and nothing happens so if you suddenly decide for some reason "i want to start using hammers but i'm only hammer level 3" there u go
Elfriede (Tom): Oh yeabhh
Elfriede (Tom): I beat the shit out of it and it wouldn't die
Elfriede (Tom): 10/10 kids made Barrett's hair a messy braid
Elfriede (Tom): And he was too lazy to fix it

Elfriede (Tom): "they tell me it looks good"
Elfriede (Tom): **it does**
Elfriede (Tom): **you're beautiful**
Elfriede (Tom): He's already married tho rip
