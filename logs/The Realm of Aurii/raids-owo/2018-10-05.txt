Bill: All steam games installed on new machine.
Bill: <@!228287793099440128> So as Leanna never got back to us, and I'm thinking she'll ghost it, and Kurtis is out...
Bill: Rather than bar crawling you wanna do a 6 pack a piece from our desks and break in my new computer on Overmemes?
Bill: *MEANWHILE THE DISPLAY ON THE NEW COMPUTER IS BUGGING OUT*
Bill: I'm going to *assume* it's a bad cable.
Dave: Whatever works, make sure on her part what she's gonna do
Bill: ~~I'm a little annoyed she didn't get back to us like she said she would so~~
Bill: I may just call it formally, cause this work stuff might leak into the evening.
Bill: <@&398644763043299328> Friday night lights? I’m out to dinner but I’ll be back like 8:30? I gotta break in the new computer.
Tikur (Kurtis): I'm down boyo
