Elfriede (Tom): I never let the stumps spawn
Nokri (Marisa): there's an order that forces branches and stuff to spawn on the fields, i dunno if it's available early game or not though. if you ship lumber, sometimes arthur might sell it in his store. there are a few areas that spawn stumps scattered around the world map.
Bill: In hindsight, I think these might be a matching set.
Nokri (Marisa): why all your apps in folders
