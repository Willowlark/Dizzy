Elfriede (Tom): perfect
Elfriede (Tom): I love how Eve comes out of Adam and the first thing he does is scream.
Aldus (Jess): He screm
Afina (Georgia🍀): It really sets the tone for his character
Aldus (Jess): Screaming his whole short life
Elfriede (Tom): so true tho
Elfriede (Tom): **B I G M O O D**
Afina (Georgia🍀): Now I can really take the time to do the things that matter
Afina (Georgia🍀): FISHING
Afina (Georgia🍀): OH ANEMONA SAYS "NUMBER 2"
Afina (Georgia🍀): _she doesn't mean 2B_
Bill: You’d be correct.
Elfriede (Tom): Yeahhhh
Elfriede (Tom): She also has background with A2
Elfriede (Tom): Cuz anemone was being left by her at some point in the past
Bill: Btw I found a summary sort of transcript for the stage play Tomu. Which is the Hawaii mission that killed A2’s unit.
Elfriede (Tom): Oh njce
Bill: It cheesy as *hell* but backstory.
Afina (Georgia🍀): How do I look at 2Bs butt and have her step on the camera
Afina (Georgia🍀): I literally never did that before
Elfriede (Tom): You just angle the camera the best you can to look through the slit in the dress
Elfriede (Tom): I have definitely not tried this cuz that would be totally stupid I just heard it from people 👀
Bill: ~~and you can look up the skirt in real life~~
Elfriede (Tom): I have <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: To get enough of an angle for it you should have 2B stand close to an edge, the use the drop to get lower. She kicks the camera up then.
Bill: 10 times for the achievement.
Elfriede (Tom): I'll never get over Georgia yelling "My Queen!" When A2 showed up again and chucking the controller across the room in an arc.
Bill: Mid Nier shoot
Tom: *mumbles to Jess*
Jess: *rolls eyes*
Jess: “Billy, Tom wants to touch the butt”
Me: “go for it.”
Tom: owo
Bill: Throwbacks.
Bill: That WAS gold.
Aldus (Jess): Good timed
Afina (Georgia🍀): ;3c
Afina (Georgia🍀): I literally cannot get this booty shot
Bill: Like I said, side of a building, she’s facing the drop, slide camera down the drop.
Elfriede (Tom): It's more trying to glipse the white of her leotard than the butt
Elfriede (Tom): Can be from the side too
Bill: Yup.
Bill: It’s a hilarious game mechanic, so I love it, but like.
Bill: If I wanna see butt imma just play A2.
