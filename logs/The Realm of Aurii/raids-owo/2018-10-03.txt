Elfriede (Tom): *so glad it automattically uses itself*
Nokri (Marisa): OH YEAH that helps!!! that basically prevents the soil quality from going down das good
Nokri (Marisa): you can also manually till by putting corn/weeds on the ground and smacking it with a hoe
Nokri (Marisa): ~~smack the weed with a hoe *this is a pure game i promise*~~
