Nokri (Marisa): if you wanna make your gear fire resistant you can try adding uhhhhhhhhh heavy spice + oil + object x
Nokri (Marisa): and make a ruby ring if you can
Nokri (Marisa): i thiiiink ruby stuff is fire resistant?
Nokri (Marisa): the heavy spice, oil, and object x should give you 60% fire resistance to whatever you add it to but make sure you add the object x last because otherwise it'll make you weaker to fire
Elfriede (Tom): Hmmm
