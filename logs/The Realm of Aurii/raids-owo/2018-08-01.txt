Bill: what the hell was the input for the spear pole dance move.
Elfriede (Tom): It was just spear as light weapon
Elfriede (Tom): I and maybe quick sword as heavy
Elfriede (Tom): Then it's prob just heavy at the end of a string

Nokri (Marisa): if u were thinking of the credits does that mean the song or were you tearing up at "sound mixing..... visual design....."
Elfriede (Tom): The song and the credits
Elfriede (Tom): So the end of noer you have to fight the credits themselves in bullet hell fashion
Elfriede (Tom): But it's near<:lenny:395307171539189760>  impossible
Nokri (Marisa): yee that's only one of the endings tho right? like the 'official' ending? i saw a playthrough of the whole game on youtube

Elfriede (Tom): You right
Nokri (Marisa): wow fire emblem has really evolved
