Bill: I think you only get one field research from each stop. No matter how many times I clear the 'evolve a grass/fire/water type' quest from the spot at my desk, it keeps coming back.
Aldus (Jess): yea the same stop will give you the same one
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah
Bill: dumb.
Dave: OwO
Nokri (Marisa): OwO
Dave: *w*
Dave: Hmm
Nokri (Marisa): Yeah it doesnâ€™t work that way ðŸ˜­
Bill: ?
Dave: * w *
Bill: Use code brackets or escape the characters.
Elfriede (Tom): \\\*w*
Bill: `*hewwo*`
Bill: \*w\*
Elfriede (Tom): Three slashes drops the format but adds the slash
Elfriede (Tom): What's the command without
Bill: Or, `\*w\*`
Elfriede (Tom): \*Nani*\
Bill: \\*w\\*
Elfriede (Tom): \*hewwo*
Elfriede (Tom): Oh one slash works
Elfriede (Tom): \ *hewoo*
Bill: Escapes are single backslash.
Elfriede (Tom): Oh only if it's immediately before
Bill: Yup.
Elfriede (Tom): Hewwo \*fwiends*
Nokri (Marisa): ```\(*u*)/```
Nokri (Marisa): glorious
Bill: So explanation, in *Markdown* based text parsers, like Discord, certain characters are used for formatting. When `*` is parsed and followed at some point by another `*`, the parser treats them as symbol representing italics. What an *escape character (\)* is a symbol that says "don't parse this symbol specially". Thats why it has to be directly paired with the character in question, it describes that character. 

Ironically, escape characters are *also* used to identify when *to* read characters as special symbol. For example, in a terminal you can use `"\[\e[32m\] \[\e[m\] ` to change the color of the text, or as you may remember from middle school you can use `\u00C4` to input characters like Ã„. (The code corresponding to that A is the *Unicode* identifier for it.) 

Also one to note, `\t` is how a tab is represented. If you ever encounters tabs that seemed shorter or longer, it's because tab doesn't have a standard length in parsers, it's usually 8(?) spaces but in reality it's the *processor* replacing the `\t` with spaces. `\n` is a newline, or what tells a computer to line break.

Elfriede (Tom): Hmm
Dave: <@184437198865563648> do you by chance have an ex raid for today in the pokemans?
Bill: Nope.
Aldus (Jess): do you dave? ðŸ˜®
Elfriede (Tom): Ye he do
Aldus (Jess): at horseshoe?
Elfriede (Tom): Yeah so does Dan and Ash
Aldus (Jess): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus (Jess): they need moral support?
Elfriede (Tom): Lmao yeahhhh
Aldus (Jess): what time?
Elfriede (Tom): 6pm
Aldus (Jess): wow what a great time to go play pokemon
Bill: sounds like a great time to be on a train.
Bill: ripperoni.
Bill: Gord going to Oakville all next week. I can work from all week.
Dave: The park is sorta a Machop zone
