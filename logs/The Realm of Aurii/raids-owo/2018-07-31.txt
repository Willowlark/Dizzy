Elfriede (Tom): I JUST NOW REALIZED YOU CAN CHARGE THE HAMMER
Elfriede (Tom): its like one shotting robots nani
Bill: wait really?
Bill: Oh right. So remember when the Scanners contacted 9S saying they needed him to upload his data so they could sync up to the server? You think that means they never got the logic virus?
Bill: ```But Thou Must!: In terms of "you must listen to what the game wants you to hear in full no matter what". You're free to attack bosses like Adam and Eve with everything you have the moment their respective battle begins, but no matter how over-levelled your character is, you can't kill them until they've finished their lengthy Evil Gloating or Expo Speak. Every time you bring their health down to near zero, they'll just teleport away and come at you again with their health bar refilled. Alternatively, they'll just become invincible until the conditions to proceed are met. Other enemies are completely unkillable by default to ensure cutscenes play out as intended regardless of player skills or auto-chip usage.```
Bill: I did this with the second Adam fight. I think I killed him twice over.
Afina (Georgia🍀): ALRIGHT TIME FOR D
Afina (Georgia🍀): What's E then?
