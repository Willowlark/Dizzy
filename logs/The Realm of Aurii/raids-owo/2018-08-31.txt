Nokri (Marisa): R A V E N
You did it you beat the game you met raven
Nokri (Marisa): Isn‚Äôt she the best
Elfriede (Tom): "Okay"
Elfriede (Tom): I love how frey responds to half the characters with: "What?" owo and just ends the converstaion there
Nokri (Marisa): ‚ÄúDid you get that?‚Äù
‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
‚ÄúGreat! Then go.‚Äù
Elfriede (Tom): "Sometimes I feel as though I can Smell sounds ya know?"
Frey: "..What. o-o" *walks away*
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): oh you can change who wakes you up?
Elfriede (Tom): why would i not want hayate to wake me up tho
Nokri (Marisa): ye! with high enough friendship you can also ask bado, volkanon, pico, jones, and nancy to wake you up
Nokri (Marisa): bado is so lazy would he even agree to help wake you up
Elfriede (Tom): Sets bado to wake me up
Elfriede (Tom): wakes up at 10AM to a little note on the night stand
Elfriede (Tom): "I believe in the honor system"
Nokri (Marisa): "wow sorry. here's uhh. 50% off this stick i found in my backyard as an apology."
Nokri (Marisa): 
Elfriede (Tom): They are allowed to touch 1 muscle.
Nokri (Marisa): hmmmmmmmmmmm
Elfriede (Tom): hmmmmmmmm
Elfriede (Tom): Is that... the trunchable?
Nokri (Marisa): vishnal messes up once and she throws him out of the castle by their pigtails
Elfriede (Tom): üôå
Elfriede (Tom): if <@!351471675843411978> wasn't sleeping shed be proud of the reference
Nokri (Marisa): she makes clorica eat too much apple pie in front of everyone
Nokri (Marisa): wake her up and have her join the chat <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Nokri (Marisa): bado's wake up call for jess
Elfriede (Tom): would female Hayate just pm be hinagiku ü§î
Elfriede (Tom): ~so no wakeup call~
Nokri (Marisa): of course not their hair color is different
Nokri (Marisa): clorica is not the best fighting companion. she has a lot of skills but also does a thing that can be inconvenient. 
some characters have really interesting quirks when fighting
Elfriede (Tom): does she .... nap <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): I like the thing when your character doesnt sleep you just yawn more and more
Elfriede (Tom): super inconvient when fighting orcs at 3 am
Nokri (Marisa): *why are you fighting orcs at 3am bruh u gotta sleep*
Nokri (Marisa): ~~yeah clorica and vishnal will sometimes throw food at you when fighting but also clorica falls asleep~~
Nokri (Marisa): porco also randomly eats during battle and whatever he eats is totally random so sometimes it debuffs him whoops
Elfriede (Tom): I once went to bed in this game at 5:34AM
Elfriede (Tom): and Vishnal woke me at 6
Elfriede (Tom): SOLID SLEEP
Nokri (Marisa): RISE AND SHINE
Nokri (Marisa): if u wear items with fatigue resistance you'll stop yawning as much
Nokri (Marisa): also sleeping past 1am doesn't give you any sleeping experience if you wanted to raise that sleeping level
Elfriede (Tom): <:lenny:395307171539189760> ah yes gotta get good at sleeping
Nokri (Marisa): gets to a boss
in the middle of bossfight
"hey hey excuse me sorry it's midnight now i have to get to sleep can we finish this tomorrow? thanks."
Elfriede (Tom): The horse boss killed me <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Elfriede (Tom): He looked dead then he suddenly got back up and killed me
Elfriede (Tom): I want prepared

Elfriede (Tom): I love that zweihaender is in this game
Elfriede (Tom): Cuz that's the darksouls meme sword

after a certain friendship level you can just enter people's houses without them being there
Nokri (Marisa): lifehack: invite someone to join your party and forcefully escort them back to their house so they can sell you stuff
Nokri (Marisa): we went on a date
he said "my girlfriend"
EXCUSE ME I AM YOUR WIFE
~~i guess this is why we don't talk anymore~~

Bill: ~~Tom did that for better part of a year after the wedding~~
Nokri (Marisa): omg tom you can't do that

Nokri (Marisa): "so this guy I know" "i'm your husband" "yeah, this dude i see occasionally"
Aldus (Jess): we still do it sometimes
Aldus (Jess): the hardest was fiance cuz once we got used to it it was time the get married
Nokri (Marisa): is it like one of those things
like a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn't a square
a spouse is a bf/gf but a bf/gf isn't a spouse
Nokri (Marisa): your boyfiancand
Nokri (Marisa): Ladies please. Form a line one at a time

Nokri (Marisa): i get very emotional about games
Bill: ~~you know if you beat the game before said business trip you won't have anything to do on the trip~~
Aldus (Jess): i was thinking that yesterday lol
Nokri (Marisa): he can try to get 100% shipping like me
max out all vegetables to level 10, unlock every recipe
beat the bonus sharance maze
raise a level 10 giant field dungeon
he's still super duper far from finishing it
Nokri (Marisa): when the business trip?
Bill: ~~also Dave and Ash might not want to be doing all the work~~
Aldus (Jess): end of septemeber
Nokri (Marisa): depending on how kind the rng gods are he may or may not finish it. the third arc is highly depending on a random event randomly triggering
Nokri (Marisa): also rune prana is a huge pain unless you get lucky and nab an overpowered weapon
Nokri (Marisa): 
Dave: " *work* "
Elfriede (Tom): Nah I won't finish
Elfriede (Tom): And again I play on break fam
