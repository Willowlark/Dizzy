Aldus (Jess): *Did she just apologize? Tonight is very strange* he thinks to himself, but its about to get stranger.  "Dig that?" he questions, never having heard heard the phrase before.  As she approaches him he unfolds his arms and leans away from her, uncertain of what she's about to do.  "What-" he's interrupted by Nokri unceremoniously lifting his tunic, revealing his abdomen. He inhales sharply at her touch, as she's never touched him outside of the necessary before. Now the heat in his face is obvious.  She gawks openly at his exposed abdomen. The phrase 'my eyes are up here' briefly comes to mind but before he can get it out he realizes her attention turning to his right side where the scar of a nasty gash displays itself. 

"Has that always been there?" she asks with a strange tone, like a mother asking where all the cookies went.

She reaches out to touch the skin just around it but before she can he grabs her wrist gentle and directs it away from him, prompting her to step back. Aldus covers himself again and stands. "Well, it was assuredly there the last time you saw me shirtless, although you were quite drunk then too so perhaps you didn't notice. Its... months old at this point but I'd prefer not to talk about it tonight." He's already divulged enough about himself for one night.  

"I should get going, It's quite late and I have business to attend to in the morning"
