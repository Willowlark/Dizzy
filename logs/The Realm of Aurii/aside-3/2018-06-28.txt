Nokri (Marisa): "Money can buy companionship. But hey, that's deep."
He seemed defensive, and was that pain in his voice? Oops. *Was it something I said?* She tried to mill over his words. Was he still angry about their rich travelling companion hiding his rich secret? Or maybe Nokri wounded his masculine pride. Guys were weird. She was so thankful to be out of the military surrounded by them. 
"Did I cross a boundary? My apologies. And sure, I bet you're a real hunk among your... pack." Nokri was fairly certain that was the word he used. She was proud of her political correctness in a tense situation. "You're all muscle-y, aren'tcha? Girls dig that." She quickly reached over to pull his shirt up, as though to show him that he's not pudgy or out of shape. 
In the process, an unnatural scar near his waist caught her eye. "Has that always been there?" she asked suspiciously, not recalling having seen it before.
