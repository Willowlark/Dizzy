Bill: "Thank you for listening to an old king drabble on the greatest alliance of nobles, nay, men and women to come together in this era, the Calloran League." King Achelous Tyndall of Laera says to be met with a hearty round of applause from the party guests. Over a dozen tables filled with a half a dozen or more guests line the borders of the hall, and the center of the hall has a wooden floor in place for dancing. One end of the hall contains matching stairs, coming up from the left and right to a balcony that over looks the whole ballroom. Achelous speaks to the room from this balcony, below which the orchestra sits. 

"The food shall be brought out in due time, but until then I encourage all of you to dance and be merry, enjoy the fruits of our combined cultures!" He finishes as the applause was just calming down, and the orchestra immediately starts up again. The varied guests of the party quickly begin to intermingle and some move to dance with wives or friends. Everyone at the party seems to be wearing their best outfits, shimmering dresses and black tailcoats fill the room. Groups form around tables, especially those with wine bottles to spare as the nobles and dignitaries of Callora share stories and tribulations of the day to day in their kingdoms.

Many discuss Dreca's advancement to the borders of Theanovene. Theanovene's neutral status has been respected thus far, but Dreca is so much closer to the Calloran borders than they were 6 months ago. It's a hot topic in every Kingdom and Region of the League, and a hotly debated one by the League Council. When does the war between Eraia and Dreca become their problem? Who does the League side with? What of Wynne's recent declaration of war against the Drecians? So many differing opinions have filled the news stands for the last month, and every day someone brings a new opinion to light on the subject.
Bill: Others discuss Calloran politics, how Rocnas to the east seems more and more detached from the League or how Etrina has allowed Eraia to enter it's borders for the first time in decades. Torshan's constantly political strife is always good for a laugh, when someone from Torshan isn't around to hear. Especially since a group of expert thieves have been raiding the homes of nobles while they're gone, taking anything of value only for it to end up in the hands of the peasants and beggers of the region. Betting on when Torshan will have yet another coup is on once again; it'd been a good 30 years but the elder guests of the party remember the last coup and can see the signs coming alight. 

Still others spend their time loudly badmouthing foreign nations in ear shot of foreigners in attendance. No one is brave enough to command about the Wynnite dignitaries, more warrior than politician, but the odd Eraian knight or Drecan girl can pick up the Calloran's commentary about them. There's the ever present racism against laguz as well, although only a handful are in attendance. Though even the humans aren't immune to the gossip circle, as some wonder where the King's daughter had been the last year and a half. 

All and all though the guests are pleasantly chatting or dancing to the lively music, and the party seems to be a resounding success. The food has yet to be served of course, but Laeran cooks put as much detail into their dishes as the mages do their spellcraft, and for an event of such grandeur they would pull out all the stops. It will be at least a half dozen songs before the cooks can prove it though and that leaves plenty of time to socialize with old and new friends...
El🆓de Faun (Tom): San and Elfriede packed their bags and donned their travel garments. Both said goodbye to their respective families, then boarded the cart (with 1 other armed Eraian Knight Escort) to be off. 

*Perhaps no one will bother them on their travels this time…*, Elfriede thought about somewhat disappointed. He longed for the adventure and excitement he experienced with his travel companions. It had been a long 6 months since his parents had been suggested to put him under house arrest. *Although…,* he lamented, *much of the trouble they found themselves in was of their own doing…*

"I am quite excited to see the world outside Eraia..", San remarked. "...And I am happy to have someone I trust with me as well." Elfriede nodded to her and smiled, returning the sentiment. San briefly considered asking about his travels, but recalling on how he has recoiled in the past when asked about the Laeran Princes he had been escorting... perhaps it wasn't the best of ideas right at this moment. Obviously enough to her, “something” had happened, but what it was wasn’t for her to know right now.

El🆓de Faun (Tom): *On the cart during the trip, they stopped at a few military bases along the coast (letters had been sent prior to their arrival). It was several weeks before they travelled up the west coast to finally arrive in Laera for the event to be shown to their temporary quarters.

Faun and San got dressed in their respective rooms. Elfriede wore a semi military formal outfit while San sported an Eraian colored ball dress, a bit fancier than someone of her class, however the Faun family paid for the tailoring of their son’s guest.*


The entered the main room together in traditional escort fashion, San’s arm around his elbow. They both were shown to their seats away from the dance floor where they both sat wide eyed. San’s eyes scanned the room in excitement. Nothing she had ever seen could compare to the architecture, mixed cultures, food smells and overall grandeur of what she saw. *And I thought the Faun’s were flush.* she thought to herself amused.

Elfriede’s eyes darted the room while he semi ducked his head. He was scanning the room for a very different reason. The Knight Lieutenant wondered if she would be out and about on the dance floor and.. just how awkward a meeting now would be. Would they even speak, or ignore each other. He certainly didn’t know what to say. Faun covered his face a bit in embarrassment. 

Suddenly everyone was silent and gazing to the far side of the room, it seemed a noble man was to speak.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): ***Papa Tyndall’s speech and music resumes***

San immediately stood up and held out her hand. “You will dance with me won’t you Sir Faun?” Elfriede peaked out a bit from his emotional shell he had been forming looking rather unenthused. “Or rather… do you even know how to dance?” She smirked a bit. "I would think that a noble knight would have to know at least a little."

Elfriede sighed and begrudgingly stood up. “Of course I do.” Dances didn't happen often in Eraia other than for courting purposes, but it was still a requirement for schooling. He thought about how similar dancing was to dueling a skilled opponent and smiled a bit at his nerdiness. 

“There’s your enthusiasm!” San remarked as they walked out on the dance floor.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aldus leans with his elbows against the railing of the balcony overlooking the ballroom as King Tyndall gives his speech. Off to the side he spots Princess Tyndall as well as an older woman to whom the princess resembles considerably, presumably the Queen. 

“Well *I* heard that the princess was beginning to get to preoccupied with *boys* instead of learning the duties to be expected of her.” he hears a haughty voice to the left of him say. The same voice he heard commenting on the amount of “pets” around a few minutes ago. 

“Oh is that *so*?” an equally as pretentious answer resounds. 

Giggles erupt from the pair as Aldus turns, closing the few steps between himself and the gossipers. 

“You know, *I* heard that people who gossip about the Princess, think the light shines out their *behinds* and then” he pauses relishing in their shocked look, “when the Princess hears this she makes it *actually happen*” He punctuates  his words with a wide grin that greatly contrasts the undertones of hostility in his statement. “Word of advice,” he continues. “Us ‘pets’ are *very* good listeners. You two have a *lovely* evening now.” he turns on his heel, clasping his hands behind his back and paces away while the pair of gossipers try to stop their embarrassment from manifesting on their cheeks. 

Spotting Vesper leaning their back against the nearby bar - no doubt observing both him and the other interminglings occurring - he saunters over to them, taking station at their side. 

“Deafening Lady’s honors Sir Larian?” They ask tease, handing him a cocktail glass matching their own. 

“And sassing racists in the name of Laguz everywhere!” He flashes a smile of thanks at the drink and takes a sip of the clouded yet translucent liquid.
Aldus Larian (Jess): “A true champion of the people indeed!” They laugh. “Some people find that attractive you know.” They add playfully touching the braid running down the length of Aldus’s back that they themselves had helped him put in this morning before leaving for the party. 

“Mmm” he say, stroking his newly clean shaven face in false deliberation. “Would ‘some people’ happen to be you?”

They give a short laugh “Wouldn't *you* like to know?” They sip their cocktail while maintaining eye contact with him as he shakes his head in mock exasperation. 

“Ancestors, what am I going to do with you?” he mutters, sending his companion into a fit of laughter.
Aldus Larian (Jess): They shrug away from the bar, “Come Aldus, let us observe the people! See if we can find anyone we know!” they flourish a bow in front of him, offering him their hand. 


He downs the the remainder of his cocktail, shakes off the bitter yet tangly burn, and places his hand in theirs as the two descend the staircase arm-in-arm. As they do, many pairs of eyes sweep over Aldus’s face and form. Some in racial discrimination but most in appreciation of his unique yet reformed appearance. 

“Someone's a head turner” Vesper comments under their breath. 

As they descend the staircase, Aldus notices a familiar Erian Knight dancing with a not so familiar bright faced young woman. *I thought for some reason he was with the princess, but I suppose it was just an escort mission. They look very nice together!* Aldus thinks, giving Elfriede a polite nod when his eyes dart up to meet his momentarily. 

There's no sign of either members of his former traveling party just yet. He assumes they would have received invitations as well. He surely isn’t of the same social standing as the Princess or even Knight Lieutenant Faun. Well not as far as the princess knows anyway. 

Aldus and Vesper finish their descent down the staircase, pausing just off to the side Aldus suddenly feels a little nervous at the idea of asking Vesper to dance. They’ve never been to any even somewhat formal event together, sure they banter and tease each other but that's usually in the privacy of their headquarters or at least under shadow of night. He fidgets slightly with the broach adorning his cravat and purses his lips in internal conflict. 

“Shall we dance?” Vesper shatters his thoughts, taking the lead. “When in Laera and all that?” 

“I’d love too” Aldus answers with a toothy grin, feeling stupidly giddy at the fact that Vesper is not afraid of this public display.
