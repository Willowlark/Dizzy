Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Chengu stood there in disbelief, speechless and confused. Princess? *The* princess? No… He was a nobody. Why would she select him of all people? He noticed that she looked a bit anxious, occasionally looking behind her as she introduced herself. Looking past her, he noticed a man attempting to make his way through the crowd towards her. He was dressed in military garb with colors matching that of the princess. Chengu looked back at the young woman of royalty before him, understanding that something was awry and she was trying to avoid this man for some reason.

He swallowed the last mouthful of champagne, placing the glass on an empty tray as another waiter passed by him. Thinking back to the “gentleman lessons” his mother taught him when he was a child, he tried to remember how to address a lady of such high stature. 

“Your highness, it would be an honor.” He bowed and tenderly took the hand she was offering him.

They made their way towards the other couples, Chengu studying the other men leading their partners in dance, trying to quickly learn the proper dancing etiquette. When they found a place to begin dancing, Chengu placed his hand on her waist while the other held her hand. He felt her place her hand on his shoulder. She hadn’t slapped him, so it seemed like he was doing things right so far.

They began to sway, trying to find the correct tempo until finally they were off, dancing along with the rest of the crowd. Chengu looked down at the attractive princess nervously, feeling the alcohol starting to ease that nervousness a bit. Trying to break the ice and awkward silence, he smiled and asked, “To what do I owe the pleasure of dancing with the princess of Laera? Is this truly a customary dance with a stranger, or perhaps an escape from a bad date?” He raised an eyebrow, smiling and chuckling flirtatiously at her.
