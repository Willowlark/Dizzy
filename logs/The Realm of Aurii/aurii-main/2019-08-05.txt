El🆓de Faun (Tom): The awkward dance was cut off by a cloud flooding the room suddenly. Faun instinctively pulled the queen away from the smoke. “I’m sorry! Come your highness!” He glanced back as they stumbled away and watched her guards be consumed and enveloped by the mist. Once surrounded never even attempted to get out. Poison?!

Faun pulled Lady Tyndall over to where San was last and to his relief she stood out if the mist and locked her gaze on him.

“San!” He hugged her tightly, glad to see she was okay and she reciprocated. They quickly broke the embrace, “Please watch her majesty, and stay out of the gas! I believe it to be poison!” Faun turned about and instinctively reached at his hip for a sword that was not there. He gritted his teeth and glanced about, most of the room being obscured. 

“My apologies for the rough treatment Lady Tyndall, where is your daughter?! She shook her head and frowned heavily, for she was not keeping track of her before chaos. He turned to the mist and shouted into it, “Afina!!” but his voice just echoed into the ensuing chaos and was drowned out. He resigned in that moment, if she wasn't in the mist... She can take care of herself. He glanced about at several Laguz attempting to get everyone out. “We should join them Miss Tyndall.” Both San and the queen nodded in unison, both of them swallowing their fear admirably. Elfriede glanced about once more, he needed a weapon. He could feel it… something in the air?... a vibration almost. He looked to where the guards were enveloped and saw a simple long sword lying in some light mist just a few strides away. He held his breath and took the chance, quickly running in grabbing it and running out.
El🆓de Faun (Tom): The sword felt heavy and unbalanced for the slender knight, but it would have to do. He looked to the queen, her face overwhelmed with confusion and sadness. This event would surely ruin any parley to unify... her daughter and husband missing. And to San, she looked... determined? He looked to her side where she grasped a dining knife so hard her knuckles were turning white. She dipped her head and muttered, “Lets go.” and the group shuffled out of the hall.
