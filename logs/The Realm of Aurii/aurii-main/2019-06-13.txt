Bill: The pairs dance around the floor, well into the next song uninterrupted. Thankfully the dancing doesn't push any awkward combinations together, at least until the third song begins. 

The dance requires the passing of partners, and towards the center of the floor a pair of dignitaries hand off their wives to each other. From their dress, anyone familiar with Calloran royalty would know they align with the Torshan and Etrinan political parties. This exchange goes smoothly enough, until the Torshan man stops dead in his tracks. 

"Do you not know how to dance, or do you do me the disrespect of not holding my hand on purpose?" He says, louder than he should. His own wife and the husband of the woman in question step over immediately. 

"My wife is not to be bullied good sir." the Etrian noble starts, stepping beside his wife. "Your new neighbors seem to be rubbing off on your manners." he adds with a digging tone.

"And your old neighbors seem quite comfortable with you joining them on their high horse." the Torshan starts. The wives, truly the saviors of these men's careers, quickly whisper to their respect partners that they are attracting attention and should take for the bar. The two men share a piercing glance despite their words. 

(ooc: These two will listen to their wives, though I'm not writing that part yet in case anyone wishes to intervene.)
