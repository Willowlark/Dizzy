Bill: Aldus, Vesper, Afina exit the ballroom from the north entrance, while Elfriede, San, and Lady Tyndall exit from the south. The hall echoes with the sounds of people running and screaming around the various corners and doors. There's only a handful of people still in the corridor, besides yourselves. 

The mist permeates the hallway completely, in fact even if you look into the ballroom you can no long see a place the fine mist does not reach. There's a single deep mist spot in the corridor, against the wall opposite the ballroom doors you exited from, basically centered between the two groups. 

Lady Tyndall comes to her senses, given a moment to breath. "Where is... Where is Achelous? He must know what's going-going" she says, her voice devolving into a cough. It appears the mist is affecting her as she starts to sway, light headed. 

A handful of soldiers round the corner, coming up to her immediately. "My Lady, we must see you to the exit!"

"Na-Not..." she hacks out, "Yet-" She's looking towards Elfriede, and beyond to the other group. "Ffind-" she manages to get out before another spell of coughing hits her.
