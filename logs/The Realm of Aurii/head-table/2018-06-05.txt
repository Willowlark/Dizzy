Eliran (Halim): As Eliran walked into the market area with Afina, he could hear a familiar offended tone, "Pardon?" Was all he needed to know who was in trouble. He sighed to himself, Well good thing I have my, our,  papers And walked over to the sound, and upon seeing Elfriede and and his two copatriots, immediately went to work. 
"Nokri, Aldus, How are you guys holding up?" He started with a smile, arms spread in greeting, Eliran quickly passed Elfriede and stood in between the knight and his friends. "Get everything we need for tonight?" Eliran asked Aldus, before looking towards Elfriede, acting as if he just noticed the knight, "May Lylalels guidance be with you," he said with a slight bow, then as if noticing Elfriede disposition he asked, "I'm sorry is something the matter?" Eliran asked sounding genuinely concerned, still standing between the two.
