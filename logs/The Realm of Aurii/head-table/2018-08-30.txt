Eliran (Halim): Throughout the travels to escape the Eraians. Eliran was passed mainly between Aldus and Afina for when he needed support. As they finally sat to rest, he sat almost motionless with his hands over his knees, trying to recuperate as much as possible. Listening to the conversation around him, he pointed to the forest ahead of them, "First we need to escape... we must go through the forest." He tried to stand up, only to stumble a bit before Afina helped him up. "The Eraian's horses won't be able to follow us, it'll make  escaping easier." He coughed and stood up properly alone before looking to Afina, "Callora should be our end goal. be we can't go by land. They'll expect it. After we lose them in the forest we should head to the sea. Find a smuggler and escape."
Dizzy: "Callora..." Desii says, looking between the Princess and her musically inclined companion. "Can we make it there? The northern border is on the other side of Trisp, we'll surely be caught... and south requires us crossing the entirety of Eraia. Surely the Cardinal will send messengers ahead?" Desii continues, her tone sinking the more she dwells on it. 

She feels a soft squeeze of her hand, Enera still holding onto the young mage's hand. Eliran suggests travel by sea, and Desii smiles at the blonde beside her. The chaos was worth the discomfort. 

"There's no port west of Trisp... There's nothing till we get down by Lyall really." Desii says, trying to remember the maps she'd seen in Zaimar's study. "We'd have to be lucky enough to stumble onto a sailing by ship, then be able to get there attention..." Desii continues as she stands up. She doesn't let go of Enera's hand, instead returning the girl's squeeze. "I suppose with the light magic users we have here, we could easily make a flare though!" she says, some chip returning to her voice. She then looks to Aldus with a smile.

"We'd also be able to find some of the Crysalin for you Aldus." she says, thinking about how far flung her friend was from his original goal. It was... honorable, the way he stepped up to help with Desii and even with the Princess. It made her smile warmer thinking that if Aldus was around when Zaimar was making his schemes... He'd have helped her, no questions asked.

Bill: The distance sound of hooves fades in and out as the horses slow to navigate the difficult terrain. Far down the hill you think you can see the dancing lights of the search party. They have unfortunately not erred from the path you just travelled. It appears they're still able to track you.
