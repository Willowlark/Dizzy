Bill: !ghost Desii frowns at Afina's information. 

"Why would he want to hide such a fact? What benefit is there?" Desii thinks aloud. She stands up, starting to pace up and down the side of the fountain. "He showed visible signs of discomfort at the mention of another Callorian. But why Callorian? The bishop I spoke to had no problems acknowledging Enera was at the Monastery, he just wouldn't let me meet her. She can't be that busy she has no time to meet someone." 

"If that translates, Enera isn't the topic that made the Cardinal uncomfortable. It's the fact that Princess Afina referred to Enera as a Callorian. Why is *that* the problem the Cardinal had, rather than the same one the Bishop did?" Desii trails off as she stares intently at her boot prints in the dirt, continuing to pace. You can see her press her tongue against her cheek in thought as she walks.
