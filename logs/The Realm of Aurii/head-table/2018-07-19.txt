Dizzy: Desii sits back down on the fountain rim, arms crossed and eyes glaring at her own feet. 

"We need more information. I can't go back to Dain and Saila like this." she mutters. Her foot starts to tap in the dirt.

"Princess Afina, might you invite us over after dinner? You saw the girl's room, at least for study. If you guide us in the evening hour no one should bother us and if I happen past that room looking for a bathroom the Cardinal can't complain." Desii says, the plan flashing through her head.

Desii approaches the Monastery with Aldus, Eliran and Nokri. Despite the whole thing behind her idea, she's found herself walking behind the two men in her party.

She was thankful for her friends support. Without them, she didn't think she could be coming here right now. She knew she was doing it for the right reasons, but damned if the idea didn't still scare her. 

The appointed time came, with the sun setting over the distant seaside cliffs. She wrung her bag tighter as she waited for Elfriede and Afina to open the door to signal them in.

Bill: (ooc:  Everyone should narrate themselves into the scene, it's a scene setting round. Afina will be on <#361532671714656266> instead of here, for reasons.)
