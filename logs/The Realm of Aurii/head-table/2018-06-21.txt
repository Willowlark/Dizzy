Afina (Georgia🍀): It’s only after the waitress brought their food, and Afina was mid-chew, that the princess realized that “Enera” sounded like a familiar name. _Where have I heard that before?_ she thought, tapping her fork against the table as she thought. “Enera…” she mumbled, eyebrows furrowed in concentration. “Where did I hear that name?”

Afina sat up straight as she remembered the Bishop yelling at a child in the monastery. _Enera is a little girl?_ she thought, glancing between the members of Eliran’s party. _Why would they be looking for a little girl?_ The princess took a sip of her drink, staring into it thoughtfully. It had been a long time since she last saw Eliran; He hadn’t been very good at keeping in touch (though that had always been the case ever since they were kids). She hoped his motivations were still honest and true.
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina looked over at her childhood companion, musing about their time spent together in their youth. Eliran had always been the worldly one, with his travelling and socializing and exploring. Her younger self had always been fascinated by him. Afina still vividly remembered the time he spent living with the Tyndalls, becoming accustomed to the noble lifestyle. A time before she knew light magic, when she spent her time reading and “playing queen” in the castle. Eliran had begrudgingly been “the king” a few times, but only after she cried when she didn’t get her way. Many had assumed that the two were to be betrothed as kids, but Afina’s father had strictly insisted that Afina find a companion of her own volition, and the princess herself was quite content to have Eliran as a brotherly figure instead. The Laeran frowned. _I hope you still are the way that the younger Afina would have known you_, Afina thought, hands fidgeting in her lap. To search for an adult for ill-will was one thing, but a child… 

“I believe there is an Enera at the monastery, yes?” Afina said, seeking confirmation from Elfriede. “She was young though, no more than a child. She must have been practicing light magic, if memory serves.” Afina pauses a moment to look between the members of the table. “I take it that this changes your plans considerably?”
Afina (Georgia🍀): ---
Afina sat in her nightgown, legs crossed, focusing on the light tomes in her lap. Thinking about Eliran’s role in her childhood had made the princess nostalgic; She had returned back to the many cantrips she first learned in her youth. Afina concentrated hard on the symbols on the page (though not inebriated, the princess had to admit that she was feeling more light-hearted than usual thanks whatever Eliran had ordered for the table, and as such wasn’t able to focus quite as precisely). Her fingers traced the unintelligible language as she read, and soon after, sparks began to twinkle down from the ceiling. Afina gazed up in awe, still reciting the familiar words of one of her first spells. _Amazing to return to, after all this time,_ she thought, the sparks falling gently down like snow. 

The princess paused as she heard movement out in the hallway; It was still relatively early, and therefore not completely ludicrous to think that someone from the party might have needed her attention. Eliran may have wanted to learn what she had been up to, Desii may have had questions about light magic already, the… small blonde...person that Afina forgot the name of. What was her name? Maybe she hadn’t even introduced herself yet. “Present yourself before the light of Laera!” Afina called through the door.
Eliran (Halim): Once the food had come out, Eliran could tell that the two vastly different parties were starting to become more comfortable with eachother. He kept a casual eye on Elfriede in particular, hoping that the meal was lowering the mans suspicions around Nokri, who's excessive politeness, while mildly unsettling, was greatly appreciated.
Eliran (Halim): ---- 
A little later in the meal, people had started to enter the Goldsmoke as it gradually approached the proper meal time. The waitress came up to the table to whisper something in the Bards ear. With a short nod, he looked to his companions, "Guys I'll be right back, I just need to take care of something." He then poured one more round of the drink the waitress had brought, passing it around. As for himself, he didn't take any, having only just finished his first glass, which was surprising as he normally would have been drinking with the rest of them, especially considering Nokri's persistent offers to fill it up once more, though he had a sneaking suspicion she had added some to his cup when he wasn't looking. 
As he stood up, he grabbed his lute case and followed the waitress away. 
Not long after, a light sound of music filled the Goldsmoke, there were no words, just the faint pickings of strings permeating the air. It was a soothing sound, far from the typically bright and  energized sound of most taverns, instead giving a calm and homely, much like the Goldsmoke in and of itself. 
Eliran sat in the middle of the stage, and outside the sound of music from his fingers, it was as if he was in a different world, untouched by those around him. He enjoyed the mental quiet playing brought him. There was no Nokri, no girl in need of saving, no Knight arresting friends, or childhood friends demanding later. Just him and his instrument, sure there may be people watching, but while the music was to entertain them, they had no bearing on his sound. It was the perfect escape for a man who lived in a constantly social sphere, to perform for that circle and get the quiet that focusing on playing brought.
Eliran (Halim): --- 
After a while, Eliran finished playing, and was replaced by other musician. Probably the Goldsmokes typical performer. As he returned to the table, it was clear everybody had finished their food, and that at least a couple of them were slightly inebriated as well. It was time to head home for the evening, and after they paid, he walked out with his friends, feeling significantly more relaxed.
Eliran (Halim): -----
Later that night, Eliran headed towards Afina's room at the Monastery. After a year of no contact at all, he wanted to catch up, and something he heard her say at dinner got him wondering. _I really hope she doesn't chew me out about not writing... I deliver letters not write them_ he thought to himself as he approached her door.
