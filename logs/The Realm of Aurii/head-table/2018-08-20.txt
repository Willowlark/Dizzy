Eliran (Halim): Anger and desperation are a short term fuel for vigor, and after being hit by Morris's most recent spell, the adrenaline was fading, along with Elirans own abilities. 
"Fall in line" was all he heard the Cardinal say to Afina... Afina, god she looked a mess, but it seemed that she was still in the cardinals good Grace's. 
He turned to look for Enera, and saw Nokri yeet over the edge with the girl _good..._ he thought to himself, _now we just need to run_ he gave a slight groan as he stood up, _I hope aldus is nearby and can catch me too_ looking at the cardinal, who was still staring at Afina. Mustering his strength, Eliran drew an arrow and let it fly towards the man. "ALDUS" he called out, falling backwards over the edge, the bow string still vibrating from the arrow he let fly.
 He hoped they'd be able to escape fast enough that Afina could avoid any major conflict with the cardinal, saving callora from any diplomatic issue. _i also hope nobody figures out who I am..._ Eliran realized as an afterthought, _Mom would be pissed if the company's rep went to crap because an Heir was playing hero._
Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina’s hot-headed nature broke through her calmer, more diplomatic persona as she watched Eliran tumble off the ledge, weakened from the Cardinal’s attack. _This is ridiculous treatment for a guest_, Afina thought, eyes ablaze with anger. _If I divulge to him now that the Bishop committed such heinous crimes, then Elfriede’s true nature is revealed,_ she thought, glancing over at the knight. He was poised to attack, clearly irritated by the Cardinal’s commands, his hand tense on the hilt of his sword. Afina’s gaze softened; She felt immensely betrayed by Elfriede’s actions, and was therefore very angry with the knight. But seeing him stand there, tense and obviously worried, still hurt her heart immensely. She could not jeopardize his welfare just to save her kingdom’s reputation. 

_Or you could kill the Cardnal_. The thought was morbid, and Afina was almost ashamed for having thought it. But if she killed the Cardinal, then Eraia would not know who to blame for the Bishop’s and Cardinal’s murder. And even if it were to be pinned on Afina, it would be speculation at best; With the state of international relations now, Eraia couldn't afford to make an enemy out of Callora anyways. Dreca was moving in to make an ally out of Wynne, who had already been Callora’s ally for years. Eraia had to tread carefully to avoid making any more enemies…

_Tyndalls pursue diplomacy up until the moment that it fails_.
Afina (Georgia🍀): The thought chided Afina. She grimaced. There was no distinct reason to kill the Cardinal here, on the assumption that she and Elfriede could even accomplish such a feat. Without the ability to kill or speak honestly with the Cardinal, the Laeran princess was left with only one option: to lie. “Actually, Cardinal, not to display the obvious but it seems that the structural integrity of your security here at the monastery has been-.” Afina stopped as her stomach lurched again, the nausea from the drugs making the acid rise in her throat. She turned to the side and promptly leaned over, yellow-green bile splattering across the floor. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. “Compromised,” Afina finished, clearing her throat. 

“One of these _ruffians_ seem to have been able to poison my food whilst I was in your care. I believe it to be your best interest to increase security.” Afina turned to leave out the door, tomes still wedged between her chest and the forearm of her injured hand. “Come, Elfriede, the safety of the monastery is not up to standard, let us pack my things and pursue the thieves. For the good of Laera as well as Eraia.”
