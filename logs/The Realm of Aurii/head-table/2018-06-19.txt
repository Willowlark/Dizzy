Aldus (Jess): To say Aldus felt uncomfortable in the Goldsmoke would be an understatement. The decor was rich and dark and the restaurant was uncomfortably warm even in his light tunic. He makes a mental note to pick up some lighter clothing, as he doesnt think walking around topless is going to be socially acceptable in Eraia. 

He follows the others lead on where to sit, ending up in between Nokri and Desi and across from the princess. Aldus sits up straight and folds his drapes his napkin neatly over his lap, trying to remember scraps of table manners he’s been trying to pick up on since his blunder a few weeks ago. 

He notes that Eliran seems very informal with the princess, calling her some silly nickname. When the princess offers to pay for the meals, Aldus is relieved. The prices on this menu are a little out of his spending comfort level. Granted Aldus is not a poor man, he gets by, but only because he doesn't waste coin on frivolous means such as these. Eliran has drinks covered it seems, and proposes a toast of sorts. Aldus makes a conscious effort to only sip, and not chug the drink down. Nokri is still holding up her good girl visage, which is unsettling and a little creepy for lack of a better word. She even  asks him politely what he is going to order, although Aldus can see her fakeness at this point, he narrows his eyes at the smaller blonde accordingly. 

He scans the menu, noting that most of is fish, in a variety of price ranges as well. *The Eraians must really like fish* he thinks to himself. He decides on a moderately priced option. “I believe I will order the salmon. When in Eraia, right?” *Is that how the phrase goes?*
Dizzy: Desii settles into her oak chair with an eye on the rest of the table. It wasn't long ago Nokri did something to anger Sir Elfriede, and yet here they were having dinner with the man. Desii nestles her knapsack between her feet as she pulls her chair in, a foot through the shoulder loop of the sack. She may be with company tonight but habits she'd picked up from traveling out of Hylley alone stuck with her. No one would steal Zaimar's book from her.

Dizzy: Desii puts the unpleasant thought and returns her attention to the room, Eliran giving a toast to new friends. Desii clumsily grasps her own mug and clanks warmly, smiling to everyone at the table, especially the Princess beside her. Her smiles breaks as she drinks the Eraian stout. Desii sputters what little of the brew she had drank back into her mug, flushing bright red as she tries to hide behind her raised mug. 

"I think I'd best stick to the wine..." she mutters sheepishly, to the apparently amusement of the group. *The waitress too* Desii moans internally, noticing the smile on the barmaid's face. Desii buries her face in the menu as a distraction, deciding after a few moments to order the salmon like Aldus. She takes another moment to relax before rejoining the conversation.

*"Hear hear!" Nokri chimed at Eliran's statement, "let us enjoy ourselves after a long and tiresome journey."*

"That'd be nice I think." Desii says, resting her elbows on the table and her head in her palms. "Tomorrow will be busy, The town isn't large but I can't imagine finding one person will be terribly easy." Desii muses aloud. She frowns slightly, adding "If Enera is even here."

"What will the rest of you do? I don't know how long you wish to stay in Trisp, though I hope we won't have to part too soon." She says, mostly to her own companions but with a nod to Princess and her*?* knight.
