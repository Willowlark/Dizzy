Afina (GeorgiaüçÄ): The occasional tear cut a clean path in Afina's dirty face as they fled Trisp. With adrenaline wearing off, her left hand throbbed with pain, though thankfully the nausea seemed to have disappeared. Another tear fell from the princess' eyes as they continued to walk. _I just want to go home,_ she thought, feeling exhausted and homesick. Eliran had been her only comfort during their hurried escape, but even he could only maintain conversation in short bursts, as his own fatigue left him winded. 

The light of the moon and stars was the only thing that illuminated their path as they finally stopped to rest on a hilltop. Scattered trees obscure them from view of the city, but not nearly enough to throw the pursuing forces off their trail. Afina wiped her face clean with her forearm, lowering her hood to address the group. She still looked quite pale, and plenty worse for wear. It was as if the confident, bright eyed Afina had been left somewhere in Trisp, and a hazy, incomplete copy of herself had followed the escaping party departing the city.

"We go to Callora, of course. We promised to return Enera, and the Callorian kingdoms will provide political asylum for you. Dreca nor Theanovene provide such advantages. And Wynne is far too distant. We follow the route Elfriede and I took to get here, surely that is the smartest decision." 

"Sadly, our pursuers don't seem to be deterred by night fall. We don't have many options besides continuing our exodus. Other than, maybe fighting them. But I doubt such an engagement would end well, given our current status." 

Afina sat down on a nearby log, dusting it off with her free hand before sitting down. She began to fidget with her hand cast; The princess had very little idea how such a binding worked. _Interesting, how I was never taught such skills,_ she thought, unwrapping and rewrapping the cloth.  

"I anticipate that this stop is short-term; we must keep walking to get to Callora."
