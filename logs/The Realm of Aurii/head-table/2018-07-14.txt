Afina (Georgia🍀): Afina exhaled as she finally reached her companions. “So, there are two possibilities that are yielded from my talk with the Cardinal. He said that I am the only Callorian studying with the monastery; Either he’s telling the truth, and this is not the Enera we seek. Or he’s lying, and does not want us--or at least, _me_-- to know such a fact.”

Afina’s eyes flickered to Elfriede and Eliran, whom she had not had time to properly greet as they walked up. Her gaze lingered on the Eraian knight, having not seen him since they spoke last night, but she quickly dismissed the thoughts that wavered in the back of her mind. The princess was serious as she addressed those gathered around her. 

“Truly, he _did_ seem confused when I asked him about another Callorian. He tensed his muscles, moved to grab his cane, and was very hesitant to respond. However, this may be a result of confusion, or deception. It’s difficult to truly discern whichever it might be. I claimed that a bishop indicated that another Callorian was here; The Cardinal said I was given false information. Nonetheless, the monastery is likely curious about the innocent mistake, or we truly are onto something that they would rather keep hidden.”

Finally, the Callorian sighs. “Either we are simply wrong, and this is not the Enera we are searching for. Or there are very real political consequences at stake here. The question left is, how does one proceed from here?”
