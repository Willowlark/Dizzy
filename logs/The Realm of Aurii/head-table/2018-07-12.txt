Bill: ```
Trisp Park, by the fountain
```

Desii knew from the moment Afina walked up that the Princess had no luck with her friend at the monastery. It was all the more confirmed by the Princess shaking her head at Desii's hopeful look. She also notes Nokri with Princess Afina, sparing Aldus a quick glance. The wolf laguz's mood always sours when the Drecian is around. 

After greetings are exchanged Afina starts to elaborate on what hapened in the monastery, though Desii becomes distracted before she hears anything of consciquence. The brunette stands quickly, tripping slightly towards the Princess. The only reason she fails to hit into Afina is the strong shoulder of Aldus she used to support herself. She recovers quickly and jumps up and down, waving. 

"Eliran! Sir Faun! Over here!" she calls, spotting the two in question walking in the direction of the monastery. She motions for the two men to join them. 

"Princess Afina was about to tell us some information about Enera Eliran." Desii says. She nods to the Knight-lieutenant, unsure how casual to be with him. She then turns back to Afina, returning to her seat on the fountain's edge in front of the presenting Princess.
