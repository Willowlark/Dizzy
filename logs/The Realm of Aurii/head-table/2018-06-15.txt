Bill: The restaurant Eliran leads the group of 6 to is called Goldsmoke, a title which makes you question just how it came into being.  It's a small building, surprising given the spacious areas of Trisp. The interior is dark reddish wood, with two fireplaces lit and blazing. Between the fire places and other light sources the room takes on a warm hue which is quite comforting. a stage occupies one corner of the tavern floor, though no band is present on it. The bar is staffed by one man in robes rather than the typical bartender, though he elicits smiles all the same. Tables decorate the rest of the tavern, more tightly than most taverns. It's clear Goldsmoke caters more to people looking to eat well, rather than people looking for a quick drink. There's no issue getting a table for the 6 of you, given the hour. Your varied party earns a momentary look from the waitress, but she is professional and says nothing more than what she needs to.
