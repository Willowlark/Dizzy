Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede sat slumped forward in the hard chair, his head still spinning from the previous encounter. He wore a melancholic partial frown with narrow eyes as he glanced to each person at the table. Despite the mounting evidence that these travelers were quite fine being left well enough alone, he couldnt shake his pre existing bias long enough to stop occasionally glancing at Nokri. Something about the girl just felt off to him. 
Suddenly, he felt a light kick on the side of his boot from Afina who had clearly noticed his frustrated and quiet behavior as being a bit out of the ordinary. Faun realized he hadn’t said a word to her since the encounter.
Elfriede began to second guess himself. "*Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh...*" He said quietly to her, not turning toward her whilst other conversation was happening around them. He tried sitting up straight more and *tried* to not look so miserable. *Perhaps… I should make it up to her.*, he thought to himself, for the girl seeps actually relatively sweet. Elfriede accepted the toast and raised his mug as well, brought it to his mouth and gently sipped it as he would often do. 
All this nonsense he got himself into broke his concentration from all the things he was stressing about before Afina suddenly bolted off. He turned his gaze toward her and smiled a bit, sighing lightly. He wanted to say *something* but he still felt hard pressed for words. He’d probably apologize to Nokri and Afina… later… this hardly seemed the place in front of everyone.
