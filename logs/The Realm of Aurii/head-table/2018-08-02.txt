Nokri (Marisa): Nokri gazed at the squirt sitting all pampered in her room. When she heard the girl was kidnapped she assumed they'd have her branded and chained to a wall in the basement. Not... this. Despite the girl being very cute with her freckles and ribbon, *decent fashion choices I suppose,* Nokri held contempt for this little girl. *Lets just hurry up and get this over with.* She stood back, letting the charismatic folk do their thing while gazing at the scribbles on the wall. She was never very good with kids. They scream too much about pain that doesn't really hurt, and are so stupid. Funny to watch but not interact with.

"Hey," Nokri whispered, tapping Eliran on the back. "Do we have anybody keeping wat-"
Speaking of the devil, a priest rolled up into the room. He was a little angry. After a few extremely welcoming works which showed just how much the priest appreciated them being there, they were enveloping in a bright light and sent blasting out of the room. It was like having someone shine a flashlight in your face, or waking up after someone drew back the curtains too quickly and let in too much light, but way worse. Nokri managed to land in a patch of clover and rolled over some, softening her fall enough to bruise rather than break. She quickly hurried to her feet and dusted off her dress, checking for tears or permanent stains. She was mad.
Nokri (Marisa): "Did the girl fall down here?" she shouted, looking around. Apparently not, unless she was obliterated by the light or ran off in the last 60 seconds. The other two had already sprung into action, but Nokri was quite defenseless. She hitched up the dress, tying it up to make maneuvering easier and vowing to steam out the wrinkles later. Scattered here and there was glass from what used to be the bedroom window. Nokri picked up some hefty, pointy shards that would work nicely as a knife and stuck them under the tied-up portion of dress which now acted like a bag. With a nice pointed shard in one hand she dashed towards the monastery entrance. With the commotion now going on, she hoped that security at the entrance was probably a little more lax than usual, and tried to push her way through the door with little care for anyone behind it.
Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede sat at the foot of the bed on the floor with his face in his hands mulling over all that had happened and what he should do next. His breathing was heavy and off rhythm. The knight lieutenant had been hyperventilating just moments before. 
The ground suddenly shook accompanied by a loud bassy sound that sounded akin to grinding or maybe an explosion. It suddenly hit him that the sound came from the wing where he left his new unlikely companions. 
“*No..*” Faun said half defeated. He couldn’t take much more of the night. He even debated taking Afina and running in his sorry emotional state. But the knight lieutenant shook his head. Even in his state he could never bring himself to be that level of stupidly selfish. 

Elfriede reached over and lifted the serene yet pained looking princess onto his back, grabbing her legs as support and leaning forwards, propping her head on his shoulder. Even just looking at her face pained him, he continuously kept remember her expression after.... He snapped his head away and readjusted her.

“I’ll find someone to help you Afina..” He said although not really believing his own words, he felt as if it would comfort her somehow, but it might have been more meant for himself. But realistically he needed help… plus there was the fact of the rumble he just heard. He needed to find the group. 

With as determined of a look as he could possibly muster Elfriede Faun walked out of the room and down the hall towards the group with Princess Afina Tyndall on his back. He felt her breath on his neck, warm but staggered. *Poison?!* Faun walked all the faster to return to them. There was nothing he could do on his own.
Elfriede (Tom): As he reached the end of the hall he began to see natural light from the moon puke into the hallway. He squinted a scrutinizing glance at the light and proceed around the final corner. Faun’s eyes widened in awe at the source. The now huge hole on the second floor in Enera’s room leading outside. The Knight approached cautiously and quietly. He heard muttering outside and noone left in the room. 
He swallowed hard and peaked into the room, then slowly entered and looked outside. “....No!....” He whispered to himself as his eyes widened again. “I thought it was over…”
Faun gripped his rapier shakily. 

(author’s notes: Actually the worst fucking night ever.)

Dizzy: Desii loses herself in the spellwork of Morras and Enera. Foolishly she tries to see the magic interact and it causes her to involuntarily grasp at her eyes in pain. Her skin tingles with the energy she's surrounded by, sheer and harsh and pure, before it's suddenly replaced with a vacuum of cold night air. 

Desii shrieks as she tumbles through the air, eyes tightly closed from the bright light and fear of falling combined. She at the least manages to get her arms up to protect her head as she slams into the ground. She slides along the ground, rather than rolling like a veteran combatant would do. It tears up the side of her hip cape entirely, white fabric flitting about in her wake. Indeed, most of her right side is tattered and torn up, dirt caking into the newly found holes in fabric. Even her pants, made of a heavier, leather based material, start to thin. 

For better or worse, Desii slams into a tree in the courtyard. Her curled up form breaks as her back takes the brunt of it, arching as if her head and feet intended to continue without her torso. The young mage slumps, tears streaming down her dirtied face. The only think that encourages her to break from defeated position she's found herself in is that the man who did this to her wants to do the same to Enera.

Dizzy: Desii blinks through the tears, slowly coming to her feet while favoring her left side. She tries to take stock of the battlefield, seeing Aldus's tail hanging from a branch in a nearby tree and Nokri running for the monastery entrance. Enera is nowhere to be found at first and Desii's heart clams up her chest before she spots Eliran defending the younger girl, still in the room far above them. Desii silently blesses Eliran for being able to stay with the girl, giving her some form of protection. Adrenline courses through Desii, and she makes for the edge of the building. 

"Enera! Jump down, it's not safe up there!" Desii shouts over the din of battle. The brunette has both of her hands free, her tome still stowed in her dusty pack, and motions upwards in an 'I'll catch you' motion.

Bill: Enera's breath comes to her fast and shallow, her eyes wide at the scene before her as she sits on her knees by the once wall. She had just counter attacked her mentor, her savior! And damneditall it felt right to the young girl, the Morras Raive before her was not the man she knew. Whether this is the true Cardinal or something had happened to the man, Enera wouldn't stand for attack these people who've come to her with such wonderful news!

The bard rushes past her, engaging the Cardinal in hand to hand combat. Enera raises her tome, ready to assist before her mind completely blanks. In the spur of the moment it was one thing to attack the Cardinal, the spell flew to her lips without conscious thought. Now, to make the choice? Enera's tome quivered in her hand. She tries to think, to express any of the cloud of thoughts that whirl around her mind like a cyclone, but the only sounds to come out of her mouth are unintelligible stutters.

"Enera! Jump down, it's not safe up there!" rings out from below, the voice of the mage girl from before. Part of Enera notes that she, and all the others with the bard, were no longer in the room while the rest of her twists around to look over the side. The youth looks at the green eyes of the mage, but can't seem to process the girl's words as she sits there.
Bill: Morras shouts out in pain as the young man still in the room slams his own tome into his face. Not a moment after the man stabs something into his gut, cause Morras to sputter and fall to a knee in agony. The spell comes to him on auto pilot, pages of his tome burning away as the Cardinal sets his state of mind through the pain in his stomach. 

A cylinder of light expands out from the Cardinal, forcing Eliran back lest he burn from the strange incarnation of pure light before him. The cylinder stops expanding as it reaches a good few yards in width and flares once. The pillar suddenly breaks, as if it were made of stacked rings rather than a solid form. The rings launch forward, swarming into Eliran and Enera. The rings sear through the two, leaving the spots where the rings hit numb from pain.

The Cardinal is once again standing after the attack, appearing from the center of the spell. More pages burn from his book at a column of light appears just outside of the room, mere inches from landing directly on Desii's head. With an angry swipe of his hand, the base of the pillar of light becomes like liquid gold, melting down and flowing about the courtyard below. The top begins to rock, it's base unstable, falling towards the tree Aldus has taken roost in.
Bill: Morras's face sets as a third spell comes into being. Helixes of light twist into existence all over the room, combining and merging into twisted columns. It's impossible to see where one strand begins and the other ends, the light emanating from the spell seems to distort the natural light of the moon, preventing you from focusing. They twist and turn their way to ceiling height, the center of the column tightening as if the strands knotted in the center. Morras heaves once, and the columns explode wildly at his thought. The strands fly about wildly, anchored only by the center knots. The once top and bottom of the helixes flail about like the end of a whip, destroying anything they touch. They wildly tear through the room, the onces close to Eliran and Enera slapping the two with the pure force of light magic. Morras watches on as the strands turn the room into a death trap, smirking and keeping the spell going with a lifted hand. 

"This is the type of power you've chosen to play with, foolish boy. And the power you shall have once you awaken as your true self Enera." He says through the storm of light whipping about. Your mobility is gone, any direction you go in the room has a knot covering that area with it's whips.
Bill: (ooc: Special notes for this combat:

You may defend Enera and roll dice to that effect. When you do, it adds to her own defense dice pool. 

Enera dropping is bad, but *not* a game over. Morras getting a hold of the dropped Enera is though.

The snap out of it goal can be rolled for when you help Enera get over attacking her own mentor and that her own mentor would attack her. This can be via words or action. )
