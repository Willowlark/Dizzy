Nokri (Marisa): Great. Here come music boy to the rescue again. Nokri's mouth formed a displeased line as Eliran and his entourage came up to their little party. Surprisingly though, he was actually coming to their defense and helping to escalate the situation instead of straight-up blaming it all on Nokri. Nice.

Desii and another random woman were just behind him. Desii was trying to suck up to the knight by doing her cute thing, *please. Get in line, girl. I've been trying that and it isn't working.* Then she just stuck her hand out weirdly. Nokri ignored her. The other girl seemed much more interesting. The blonde was well put-together, appeared to have some degree of control over this knight, spoke in a rather regal tone... and did she mention a family crest? *Helloooo, miss. Who might you be?*

"Do you have any proof that I'm Drecan? And now you're assuming his origins too?" She gestured at Aldus. "I already requested you *please* stop jumping to conclusions," she protested again. Her tone was polite and innocent-sounding with a hint of sternness. Yeah, she was Drecan, but this guy had no solid proof at the moment and thus had no basis for his discrimination. Nokri wanted to see him struggle and maybe get some reparations for his upfront behavior.
