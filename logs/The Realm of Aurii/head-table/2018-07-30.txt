Eliran (Halim): _This is why I hate the super religious_ Eliran thought to himself listening to the Cardinal drone on. As the man continued his rant, Eliran fingered the bag he brought on his back, containing the ammunition and bow he had prepared in case something went wrong. He glanced to Aldus, hoping to see the laguz also preparing to abscond, until he heard the Cardinals words...
"... _your blessed light!_" 
A light enveloped the room and Eliran was thrown against the wall... or what was left of it. Groaning slightly he noticed only he and Enera remained. _Shit_ was his only thought as the man started to blabber about position or something. he glanced in Enera's direction, _well at least she's on our side_ 
Eliran looked around, spotting a tome by his feet. Quickly he grabbed it with his left hand, opening to a random page, bullshitting a chant as he carefully slipped an arrow into his other hand, "By the light of the lord, may his wrath shine and..." he started, using lines from a show he had seen done a thousand times in one of the performing troupes that worked with the Cantaret company. He met the Cardinal's eyes, "pierce you with strength..." Eliran suddenly launched towards the man, pushing the tomb from his hand into the mans face, "of a thousand suns!" He cried, taking one more step forward and putting his momentum behind the arrow in his right hand, forcing it into the mans gut.  _Not enough_ Eliran thought to himself as he continued his attack, not wanting to give the man a second. _I need to get the book out of his hands_ Eliran kicked at Raive's solar plexis with his left foot and swung his free hand at the tomb, hoping that it would be enough to disarm the man.
