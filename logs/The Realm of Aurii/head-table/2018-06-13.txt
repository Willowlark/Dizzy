Elfriede (Tom) ♍: Elfriede face fell into a “fed-up” visage. The man who just stepped in front of him greeted him as if he didn’t just interrupt his important conversation. He had only **just** gotten them to agree to come with him. As the proud Eraian knight opened his mouth to speak he was suddenly greeted again by… *Afina?* Who quickly grasped his arm. The princess’s quick explanation that she knew this man and his friends made Faun’s head swirl. So much just happened in that 10 second span that Elfriede had to briefly close his eyes to take it all in.

He sighed briefly, “I’ll stand down… but do tell me why your friend has a Drecan in his company... Who furthermore looks like she's been through hell.” He said frustrated while raising his free hand in the direction of the blonde Drecan. He took in her tired but young features, her pseudo smile, and her injuries. He couldn't help but feel bad for her despite everything.

“And…” his gaze turned towards the white haired man, to which he spoke in a confused tone. “...a northerner?” he gazed at the laguz, hair clearly recently washed. He owned a stern visage, a trait of the wolves that Elfriede knew all too well… yet there was something aloof about him, but he radiated a kind spirit.
Dizzy: Desii didn't step up behind Eliran as the bard stepped between the Eraian knight, and she certainly didn't follow the Princess as she clung to said knight's arm. The scenario looked like something out of one of her mother's trashy (but secretly rather enjoyable) romance novels. The two childhood friends reunite, only to find their respective groups at odds with each other. Sure, no blades were drawn, but it paints a pretty picture. It even covers the racism sub genre, if you include the human knight threatening a laguz. 

Still, they hadn't been in Trisp half a clock's rotation yet, Desii prayed they wouldn't be arrested in so little a time. Her eyebrow quirks as she mentally corrects herself. *"Hopefully we aren't arrested at all, despite Nokri's heritage."*

Thankfully the knight backs down at the Princess's words. Part of her wants to question why an Eraian knight is taking orders from a Callorian, but she felt it wise to not comment on their salvation. The knight still had questions though, and helping local law enforcement is always a good thing. She looked to Aldus and Eliran, not even bothering to considering Nokri. Aldus seemed bothered by the knight, and Eliran just set himself against him. Desii gulps.

"G-good afternoon Sir Knight." Desii says, stepping forward. She gives a small curtsy of her hip cape, blinking quickly as she remembers reading Eraian traditions once. She hurries out of the curtsy stance (somehow managing to wobble slightly) and extends her hand to the knight before her, palm down. As she recalled, knights kiss the hands of ladies in Eraia upon meeting them; a tradition started to honor Lylalel's feminine form and call reference to a Eraian knight's service to her above all. Desii looks down at the ground the whole time, unable to imagine looking at the knight while he kissed her. She hoped her cheeks didn't blush at all.
