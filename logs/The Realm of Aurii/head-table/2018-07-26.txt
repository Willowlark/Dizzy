Elfriede (Tom): Elfriede grew increasingly agitated and worried with each passing step up to Enera’s room. So much so that he did not even notice when the girl open the door, slightly stunned by everyone's presence. Upon seeing the girl again he wasn’t sure if the girl even recognized him from their earlier tour. She gave off an odd mix of naivety and intelligence. He wasn’t sure if this girl really understood what was happening or … she understood just fine. 

When Dessi spoke. Elfriede raised an eyebrow at her recognition. He shook his head. *Its really none of my business… Moreover…. I must…* he looked back. Or rather, not something he was concerned about at present. His princess was still missing… 

“Im off to find the princess. I hope you found what you were looking for.” Faun bowed slightly to everyone in light of an apology and began walking down the hall toward the classrooms, uncaring if others followed. 
---
Elfriede (Tom): As Faun walked down the hallway his heart raced again. *Maybe they took her out for food? It's oddly silent now..* He couldn't help but feel like something was amiss. He picked up the pace. As he neared the classrooms Faun heard a deep **thud** from inside one of the rooms. His heart skipped a beat and he sprinted up to it shouting through it. 

“Hello?! What's happening in there?!” He went to open the door. **Locked**.

The light shuffling on the other side of the door and the silence concerned him deeply. 

“Please open the door, somebody!” he knocked heavily on the door.

His response being his voice echoing throughout the halls. Faun gritted his teeth. **I can't believe this!** Who is so damn foolish as to ignore me?! No priest of of the Good Lady...

He planted his feet firmly on the ground and pressed all his minor weight into the door hearing a very slight buckle. His weight wasn't going to do much, but.. He pressed upward leveraging his anchored feet with the floorboards trying to force the handle upward. The door cracked loudly but alas.. did not budge. 

“LET ME IN DAMN YOU.” Elfriede placed his dagger firmly in the key hole and spun quickly kicking straight out, planting his boot firmly on the hilt slamming the dagger through the lock shattering the mechanism… and his dagger. The door loudly popped and swung open slamming hard into the wall.
Eliran (Halim): As Elfriede lead them to Enera's room, the lack of Afina's presence became more and more notable, _She's not one to let something get in her way_ He thought, looking at Elfriede, noting his increasingly agitated stride, _he doesn't know where she is either..._ Eliran thought, now becoming mildly paranoid, _Where *is* she._ He pondered as they got to Enera's door, still lacking an Afina. 

Enera's comments didn't surprise him, it was the in her eyes. Those eyes weren't the eyes of a normal 13 year old girl, and Eliran pitied her. _She thinks that she's the only one left_ it was a sobering thought. Eliran looked to Faun as he prepared to storm off hunting Afina, conflicted on whether or not to follow the man. On one hand, he needed to protect Afina, but on the otherhand he had a sneaking suspicion that leaving his friends here alone may only lead to trouble. _Well at least Elfriede's going, plus this way theres no way to connect us with her anymore_ Eliran assured himself, only just barely trusting the knight enough to storm off into the distance without following him.
Bill: "I would think not. Enera, return to your desk!" A voice barks from the doorway. The older man has hawkish features, narrow eyes that are accentuated by the wrinkles on his face and a slightly hooked nose. His hair is grey and he is clearly in his 60’s or older. He wears traditional robes of a Cardinal, and he carries a tome in his right hand. His steel grey eyes pierce through you and the frown on his face makes it very clear he's an unhappy man.

"Cardinal Raive! These people were sent by my parents Cardinal, Mama and Papa are still-" Enera says, standing up and smiling at the man.

"Quiet girl!" Raive barks again. Enera seems surprised by the outburst. "You cannot trust these people, they tell you I lie? Preposterous!"

"You're mistaken Cardinal, they know my parents, they told me-" Enera starts again.

"Enera, you shall be quiet." Raive says, the ice in his voice dropping the temperature in the room. Enera tenses up visibly, her arms wrapping around her shoulders again. 

"Why... are you not happy Cardinal?" she asks quietly, her green eyes locked on the Cardinal. The man scowls and lightly flips open his tome. 

"I suppose this is the greatest of tests my lady." he says. "Enera, your talent with light magic is unheard of. So unheard of in fact, that when I did I knew you must be one of two things; a demon in human guise... or the reincarnation of Lylalel herself." he says, thumbing through pages. Enera steps backward, supporting herself on the lip of her desk. She's clearly never heard this before.
Bill: "I, by every oath I have swore to the church and to my Goddess, cannot let a demon live on this plane. But your beauty, and your talent with something so pure as the magic of the Goddess... I had to know if you were indeed Lylalel reborn. It is my test of faith, my life has lead to this moment where I must make this judgment. Will you be our Lady of Light reborn, leading us to victory against the heathen religons of this world? Or are you a false god, an idol meant to sway our hearts from the Lady? Every lecture, every lesson, every spell cast and battle won. Each of them guide me in finding the truth."

"2 years I've observed you, and I truly do not know. I see Lylalel in you, in your eyes and smile. Yet here you are *clinging* to the earthly parents I pulled you from! This is... merely another test. A test fo *your* will, and of mine to support your true self. You may not have the willpower to stay and prove yourself as our Goddess... But I have the willpower to keep you from swaying." He looks up at the assembled room.

"You will not be leaving Enera. I shall either prove you a Goddess or slay you as the servant of Lyarlel you are. This shall be yet another test of *my faith and your true self; I shall remove those who try to sway you and purify you with your blessed light!*" Raive bellows and a spell launches from him. No words were spoken, no indicators made. 

A column of light rips up from the floor, spreading out like water. The light dances with highlights and dull spots interweaving, confusing your eyes as it spills over you. The light itself feels so pure and warm, yet painful and too clean for your senses to comprehend. Before your senses are overwhelmed entirely you hear the familiar words of spell craft. Light washes at you from behind, swelling against the rotating and dizzying wall, sphere, ever changing attack from the Cardinal. The sensory overload forces you to cover your eyes as everything suddenly goes dark with the force of a bang.
Bill: Desii, Nokri and Aldus fly backwards, only they don't hit the wall of the Monastery. Instead they fly out the now destroyed back wall, falling a story to the ground among the rubble of what was once the wall that kept Enera in. Enera herself is on the rim of the once room, resting on one knee with a tome balanced on her front leg. She's broken out in a heavy sweat and is panting heavily. Next to her is Eliran, who hit one of the few remaining pieces of the wall and didn't fly out in the blast. 

Each of you feel fine, though possibly a little nauseous from the light show. Those on the ground can just barely see Morras step forward, also unharmed from the blast. His tome is at the ready and his eyes are alight with a fervor that shakes you to your very core. 

"Interlopers. I am Cardinal Morras Raive of Trisp, leader of the most advanced Light Magic study in the world and decorated general of the Eraian army. I shall slay you in the name of Lylalel, to protect her reborn self and punish you for your attempts at corrupting her. In her name I pray."
