Afina (Georgia🍀): Following behind Eliran, Afina saw his companions before she spotted her own. _A small Drecan and a wolf laguz… interesting company to keep, Eliran,_ Afina thought, analyzing the two that Eliran had greeted so warmly. _Are they his friends? Eliran was always awfully popular in our youth,_ Afina thought. _And for a southern Drecan and seemingly Wynne laguz to be in the same place… they must be people that Eliran had picked up along the way._ Afina couldn’t say she was awfully surprised, Eliran was social like that. 

It was only then that Afina realized who they were talking to. _Elfriede!_ The knight looked stern, but strangely out of place as he looked between the three foreigners that stood before him, still holding Afina’s bag in his arms. The Eraian seemed like he was going to address Eliran in particular, and it was almost comical seeing Elfriede try to stare down the musician. _This is quite the horrid first impression,_ the princess thought, hurrying to the spot where the four had gathered. 

“Elfriede!” she called, nearly crashing into her escort as she came to a stop. She grabbed his arm in the typical escort-charge position. “I’m terribly sorry, I left my family crest back at the monastery. It’s important to me so the second I realized it was missing, I-- well, you understand,” Afina explained hurriedly. _Now to resolve this… hopefully_, Afina thought, turning to gesture at Eliran with her free hand awkwardly. “Elfriede, this is Eliran, one of my friends from my youth. It seems his entourage is also in Trisp on business similar to our own. How interesting that fate would align so that we could meet here, yes?” she explained quickly. Afina tried to smile to release the tension; The princess hoped that she did not look as tense as she felt that she did.
