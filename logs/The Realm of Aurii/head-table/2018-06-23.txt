Nokri (Marisa): Nokri was on cloud nine all evening. Good food with prestigious company and light entertainment, and she wouldn't have to pay a cent. She decided to live in the moment and enjoy this while it lasted. Heaven knows she earned it. She was on her best behavior even after several rounds of free drinks.

After dinner, they each parted ways and Nokri was incredibly pleased to find she even had her own room, with a complementary set of clean pajamas folded neatly on the bed. *Wonderful! This is how things ought to be.* She enjoyed a brief respite by plopping down on the bed and basking in the comfiness  Voices in the hall caught her attention, and she curiously made her way to the door. She pressed her ear against it to listen, hearing two familiar voices but struggling to make out what they were saying.
