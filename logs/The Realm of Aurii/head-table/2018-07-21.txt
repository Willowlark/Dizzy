Elfriede (Tom): Faun felt, in general, dismissive of this whole situation. It didn't involve him or Afina and in general seemed like reckless speculation. Enera could have been the daughter of one of the higher-ups easily. He felt these new *friends* were acting on levels of speculation with little to no evidence, which made him uncomfortable acting. 
Faun faded back into the conversation as Desi spoke about the meetup. His eyes drifted to Afina who appeared to be listening intently. He hadn't seen her the entire day. Her face brought the memories flooding back, which he closed his eyes briefly to suppress. Despite it all,seeing her face gave him a sort of calmness.
*If she wants to go along with it, I suppose so will I… for now*, although he doubted the wisdom of the decision. Faun locked eyes with her for a brief moment in which he smiled and nodded at her, but no words were exchanged between the two in that moment. *It hasn't been long enough, perhaps I need more time to think...*, he thought to himself as the group departed. Their planned chat about their future together clearly wasn't happening tonight...

Several hours later at the appointed time, Elfriede arrived at the door exactly on time. He glanced around at the absence of the princess, sighing in a failed attempt to relieve his jumpy nerves. After a few moments, he whispered at the dark part of the hallway, *“Fina?”*, to no response. Slightly enerved, he placed his hands firmly against the door where his new companion's waited and cracked it slightly.
