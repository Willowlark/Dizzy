Dizzy: Desii jolts as Aldus comes up beside her, outstretching his arms to catch Enera when she jumps. Desii hesitates for only a moment before entrusting the rescue of the girl to her wolfen ally. Aldus was... responsible, if quiet. She knew he wouldn't give up Enera. It was an aura the Naissankari gave off, one that radiated compassion for his fellow man. As foolish as it was to trust a young girl's life to a feeling, Desii felt... confident, in Aldus. She just knew Aldus would put Enera's life above his own, simply because that's who he was. 

Desii jogs backwards, cracking open Danthres's tome. If she were to battle spell craft with a Cardinal in the Eraian church, she would need to play with spells at his left. Danthres was a potion maker more than anything else, but his few spell were said to embody chaos. 

Desii reads the spell quickly, refreshing herself on the mental state she needs to be in. It's easy for her, as the state for the spell requires that of the loyal dog, the dog that waits day after day for it's master's return. Desii imagines it as Enera, waiting and waiting for the rescue she didn't know she had coming. Words come to her lips and she raises the tome towards the room above.

Wind swirls around Desii, the tips of her hair whipping the nape of her neck. She lets the wind build, knowing the longer she stands firm the more wind will spring from the point she chooses at the release of the magic. If she can get enough wind behind her to force Enera off the side of the building it will be worth the biting cold on her exposed skin, the numb pain in her knees as they buckle against the force of the winds around her. 

*Hold on Enera... I'll get you off there...*

Bill: Morras watches his spell craft dig into the bard, a grim expression his face as he watches the man suffer. Still, the Cardinal had seen far worse and wouldn't be shaken by a pained face. Waiting for the man to fall unconscious, Morras stands tall until the sound of shattering glass rings at his feet.

Shards of glass ring as they shatter, cause Morras to jump back into the hallway on reflex. Arrows crash against the wall behind where he just stood, making him momentarily thankful for the strange form of attack. Morras spins on a heel, only to see a small blonde girl dive past him and run straight for Enera. His spell's concentration broken, nothing stood between her and his charge and that wouldn't do at all.

Pillars of light rise in Nokri's way, making her path sporatic and dangerous. Morras smirks, doubting the frail looking Drecian could navigate the course he'd made for her. Confident in his obstruction, he addresses the other people outside the room.

"Lady Tyndall. Assaulting a Cardinal will not earn you any favors in the Eraian government." He warns, his eyes narrow and dangerous. "And Elfriede, I do believe I gave you an order. Your insubordination aside; Torin has nothing to do with this scenario and I don't have the slightest clue as to why you'd bring him up. If you have grievances to air with my head bishop there is *surely* a more appropriate time, don't you think?" Morras chides, his tone becoming clipped as speaks. 

"I insist the two of you fall in line; this is a combat situation. Whatever may be troubling you can wait, you are *adults* are you not?" he says, his gaze questioning every part of your resolve.

Nokri (Marisa): Somehow dodging most of the collapsing ceiling and searing light beams of death, Nokri scurried to Enera's side. "I don't think you should stay here," she muttered simply. She wrapped her arm around the girl's waist, simultaneously dragging Enera's weight and nudging her with her shoulder as they struggled to what used to be the wall. *Desi better be ready to catch us or I swear to whoever the [censored] it is this church worships."

It would have been wise just to throw the girl off the wall, but Nokri did not plan that far ahead and instead just tipped the both of them over the side. "Cover your head," she suggested as though they were taking a walk through the park and not diving off the edge of a church.
