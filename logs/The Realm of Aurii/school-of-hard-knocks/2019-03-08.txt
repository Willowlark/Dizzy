Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh shit, I never noticed... Like, some of her posts get less likes than *mine*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Her posts get like the same or less than me and I have like 1/5 the following
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~she nice, but she does post a lot of the exact same photo with different backgrounds over and over again~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~she nice, but she needs to show emotion on her face when posing~~
Bill: Yeeeeeaaaaaahhhh she has same fame syndrome.
Bill: It bad.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The photos where she's leaning in as if to kiss someone kill me because you don't lean into a kiss with resting bitch face
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaaa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Exibit A

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i mean
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): not to be that asshole but:
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): wheres the difference
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so like yea i could totally see her buying followers, especially if her posts get only about 100-170 likes each
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think shes really nice though and would be deserving of more followers if she learned to pose more and make new faces
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause her cosplays are really pretty good
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and she always looks great
Bill: She‚Äôs very into it for the fame. Has a habit of dividing cosplay and not cosplay parts of her life too, so you can‚Äôt even be friends with her. Aaaand her triple posting/ constant stories are so annoying I unfollowed her. 

But I‚Äôll never forget that after a very long and stressful Saturday at Katsu‚Äô17, at the GB JNPR shoot end of day, she was the one to ask if I‚Äôm okay cause I looked the way I felt.
Bill: That meant a lot.
Bill: Iirc she buys all her cosplay. No less valid, but just so you know she isn‚Äôt punching those out a half dozen a month.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh no i know that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but she still pulls them off well
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they all seem to fit her correctly and wigs look very good
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I finally actually talked to her at Katsu she seems nice enough
Bill: Yeah they do.
Bill: ~~the only part that doesn‚Äôt look true to character is expression riiiip~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yeeeeeeeaaaa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Someone on the floor is playing Bruno Mars *and it's like the same 4 songs on repeat*
Bill: lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye she‚Äôs been nice to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But she was very nosy about the circumstances of Hal and my break up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like three days after it happened
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the fame-wanting makes me nervous cause as I get more followers I get the ‚ÄúWill people try to use me‚Äù feelies
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Bill: mm. You've survived that before *cough Ethan* cough, and if you don't spot it we would.
Bill: Man I dunno what the trips for that is in reality.
Bill: Just keep instagram out of your friendships/when you meet people. If people steer towards 'man I wish I had as many followers as you, what's that like' constantly, they fucks.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Does Dizzy respond by just saying Ethan?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nah only Knight Light
Elfriede Faun (Tom): GASP
Elfriede Faun (Tom): NOT ANYMORE
Dizzy: I ship Knight Light!
Bill: she cares if you ship knight light.
Bill: see?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oooo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ship Knight
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ship light
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Which ship, should I ship tonight
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): What if you don't ship Knight Light
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Woah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I guess she doesn't care then
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ship knight light
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Or she just stopped caring
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or she only cares when Bill says it
Bill: caps probably.
Dizzy: I ship Knight Light!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ship knight light
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao
Bill: I gotta deal with caps eventually.
Dizzy: I ship Knight Light!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ship knight light
Dizzy: I ship Knight Light!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Don't ship knight light
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Bitch
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I saidddd
Dizzy: I ship Knight Light!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Dizzy, you don't ship knight light
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dizzy doesn‚Äôt believe that because she has access to the chat longs <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also Sakura only talking to me about cosplay always made me like üò¨
Bill: That's how she is with everyone. Tis why I don't talk to her much, cause not the kind of friend I look for.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i guess that is true, when i talked to her it was only about cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was weird cause I was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your job‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúwhat cosplays do you have planned‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your boyfriend like‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúhow did you make Pyrrha‚Äôs thing‚Äù
Bill: I've literally been the same weight for a week. Down to the decimal. That's weird.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is that disheartening?
Bill: Just weird.
Bill: Numbers don't mean shit to me, so if I'm slimming and the number ain't moving I don't care, but the only ones who 'notice' anything are my Mother and Sister who are *basically* obligated to always say I look better every day. Myself included, so the number is just to be sure *something* happening. 

But it very weird to not shift slightly. Weights aren't that constant, cause every day you eat different foods.
Aldus Larian (Jess): hmm that is odd for it to not change at all
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah
Bill: I may swing by my GP tomorrow, see what she has to say...
Bill: Cause I'll get more drastic than no carb if I gotta.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you might be plateauing, which usually involves either a a more drastic diet change or adding in exercise/ more intensive exercise
Bill: which is what Mom keeps saying.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): walk up and down your driveway a few times a day üëç
Bill: snrk.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lmao
Bill: https://themighty.com/2019/03/everyone-hates-me/?utm_source=Mighty_MH_Page&utm_medium=Facebook&utm_campaign=Link_Content_Strategy&fbclid=IwAR1UiDN3iK57FMtgmg8z71BXYJBlxT1kl0CqO2sX7EwVMJUpsQZDRSLOa04 ~~I do way too many of these fuck~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): while carrying ~~all your camera gear~~ a heavy backpack
Bill: oh.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~wait these things arnt normal?~~
Bill: Okay it's probably click bait from facebook but.
Bill: I've done all of them at somepoint so.
Bill: wow.
Bill: My camera bag only ways 15 pounds.
Bill: I thought it'd be more.
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah i mean i used to do all of these but im a bit better now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've done a bunch of these too
Bill: ~~I'm now judging everyone at ANYC last year, that bag weighted *less* than 15 pounds~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i work out with 2 8lb wiehgs
NüÜóri (Marisa): Wow an article about me
Jess uses children to gain muscle mass
Bill: *I called dibs, you have no choice but to be loved*
NüÜóri (Marisa): I haven‚Äôt looked into anyone‚Äôs eyes for years I forget what an eye looks like
Aldus Larian (Jess): the both of you are loved
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have problems looking into eyes of people i dont like or dont know
Bill: naaaah boiiii
Aldus Larian (Jess): or if i feel awkward
Bill: I mean, there's some bullshit you fall in love with someone if you can look in their eyes for 7 or 15 seconds, something like that.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Oh yeah that used to be a big thing people said
NüÜóri (Marisa): Quick someone make a manga out of it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): guess i be fallin in love with everyone then
Dizzy: http://i.imgur.com/wSYfubI.gif
Bill: !lewd
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/4RfUPvd.gif
Bill: !lewd
Bill: oh okay. I got worried it wasn't randomizing for a hot second.
NüÜóri (Marisa): Leanna is the most dominant person in here she can look *anyone* in the eye
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea fam
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): although i did cry after looking leon chiro in the eyes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so that docks dom points
NüÜóri (Marisa): Demand a rematch
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): next time **i** will quote jojo and make *him* cry
