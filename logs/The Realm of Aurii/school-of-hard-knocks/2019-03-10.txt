NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): oh the war against lady who towed our car is on
reportedly she's a renter and the neighborhood is trying to cut down on the number of renters, and this is far from her first offense
so bojo is appealing to section 8 to get her housing revoked <:woah:543194447345876998>
Bill: ooof
Bill: She mean tho so.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): yeah we're pressing charges against her too i think
she texted us admitting she towed the car, the reasons why, and that she was gonna call the police to file a fake claim against us
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): oh she's also violating her lease because it's for 2 people but there are 5 people living in her house
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i worry for bojo because the lady is involved in the gang war stuff that's happening and people don't mess with her because they might get shot. but also bojo saved her nephew's life last year and someone from her family who's a high ranking gangster gave bojo his protection in return so idk
Bill: Bojo is a badass.
Bill: She'll be okay.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~who is Bojo?~~
Bill: Mawisa's mom.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OooOOOOoooo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Guess I'm not bringing Blake or Kirishima to CCE
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Oof
