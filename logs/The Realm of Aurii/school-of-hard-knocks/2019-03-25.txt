Aldus Larian (Jess): <@301927856240459777>  let us know when you get home ♥️
N🆗ri (Marisa): Literally just walked in and Sylvia is going through so many emotions
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is she ok?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Our neighbor has been feeding her and the neighbor is a total stranger and no one else has been in our house for 5+ years so Sylvia must have been very spooked expecting us to be at the door every day and seeing the neighbor. When I got in I walked upstairs to find her and she was on the bed in total defense mode, fur out and ears back and raised haunches. I realized I was still in my costume with ears and wig and makeup and all and she didn’t recognize me so I said her name and she instantly jumped down and ran over purring and now she won’t stop climbing on me ;u;
Bill: SO CUTE
Aldus Larian (Jess): AWWWW
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Awwww
N🆗ri (Marisa): She went to use her little box for a minute and then ran back down to me at full speed ;u;
Aldus Larian (Jess): She miss u! 🎉
N🆗ri (Marisa): I did pester the cat sitter every hour
Aldus Larian (Jess): Marisa be like "if one hair on Sylvia is out of place I will end you"
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH
I was like “does she have fresh water. In all of her bowls. Did you replace her dry food and wash the wet foot bowl and give her a new wet food. Is it a different flavor than her last meal because that’s important she likes variety. How much did she eat? How many hairs did she shed”
N🆗ri (Marisa): “Did you give her a snack and what kind was it and how much and did you put it away properly because if not she’ll find the snacks and tear them open and binge eat them and get sick”
N🆗ri (Marisa): “How many of her toy mice are on the ground and how did their positions change since you last entered the house”
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🙏
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow, your inner Jumin came out
N🆗ri (Marisa): Our cat friends are very important we can’t spare any expense
N🆗ri (Marisa): Isn’t that why Jumin is popular. Everyone relates to him because Elizabeth.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): because everyone loves ~~bondage~~ cats!
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
N🆗ri (Marisa): I just took a shower she’s screaming and clawing at the door I’M HERE IM COMIN AAA
N🆗ri (Marisa): Never alone again Sylvia I promise
Bill: I lost two pounds over a con weekend. That’s a good.
Bill: Even if I really want one of those pretzels.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yay!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm sude all the walking and only eating one really meal every day helped lol
Bill: You’d be surprised but yeah. Time to eat only one meal a day forever.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Boy I really wish my boss would actually look to hire a new QA person because I'm tired of the extra work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, when they fired our last guy he offered to let me take on the position and bump my salary and I declined
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and yet, I still get the work
Bill: Tell him you want that bump if you're getting the work.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just don't want to work lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's not stuff I want to do
Aldus Larian (Jess): I got new glasses and the first thing my boss says is "what happen to your EYES"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Unless they are swollen but I dont think so
Bill: *You still have color contacts in*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do you normally wear your contacts to work?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nah never I can't stand staring a at a screen with them in
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe he was just so used to you wearing your old glasses and the new ones threw him off
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao maybe or I look as tired as I am 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://media1.tenor.com/images/af9b1e6c232cbb378e66c04232e70bdd/tenor.gif?itemid=8356140
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Bill: CuTe!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I like those a lot
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thank!
Aldus Larian (Jess): They were cheep so I mean get them in a few colors
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): smart
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Zenni?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea! I got them thinned and blue light canceling and it was only 30 with shipping
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I need to get some blue light cancelling glasses
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also my glasses need new lenses but I'm too lazy to go to my optician to order new lenses xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I've been getting headaches at work which I think was from my glasses not bring my new prescription but I'm hoping it helps
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh yea ordering online is pretty easy as long as you have a ruler with millimeters 😂
Aldus Larian (Jess): Which I'm sure you do
Aldus Larian (Jess): I wanna get new lenses out in my other ones but yea lazy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have so many Zenni glasses but none of which I want to wear for everyday wear lol
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea these are my first
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have 7 Zenni glasses, two of which are sunglasses and three are for cosplay lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have about the same number but they are all just every day use glasses xD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I'd def use then for cosplay hut I cosplay almost no characters with glasses
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but half of them are my old prescription'
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): the sunglasses though are GREAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): Persciption sunglasses would be nice to have
Aldus Larian (Jess): I usually just put giant aviators over my glasses for driving 😂
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats a mood, i used to do that too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Leanna, I found some bee glasses for you
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.zennioptical.com/p/breezy-eyeglasses-/44325?skuId=4432515
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i....kind of...want them
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theyre so ugly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but they're *honey* coloed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theyre horrendous and i have a mighty need
Bill: *I don't have to make everything perfect for everyone, let a **30 person** D&D game mistake go...*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yikes hard pass
Bill: We had two groups of 6 for Aurii which is 100% less involved that D&D and that blew the hell up.
Bill: (speaking of, I have a principle with Aurii where I don't hound players to play, because I don't like to feel like I'm forcing people to do things ~~with me, but that's another story~~, so if you are having issues on characters you gotta ask.)
Bill: Or just in general. Questions welcome, silence met with silence.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeeeeaaahhh gotta finish that up. Now that cons and cosplay are over for a while, I should be able to get on that more
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ngl, i have a lot of shit i need to actually get done costume wise and IRL, so Idk if i'm gonna have the time right now to start the game with you all, so if you guys want to start it up without me, please don;t hesitate to do so. I have a habit of overloading myself with things to do and then not having enough time to do them all. So, don't wait on me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i'd still like to play at some point if at all possible, but realistically currently i just don't have the time~~
Bill: You can always drop in. It's not a huge deal.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~however i can draw ya'll fanart~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Im just having major executive dysfunction whenever i try to re do his character sheet
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats a huge mood.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have to actually START arryn's blake robe, but ive been avoiding starting it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but now that zenkais over....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i have to
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Leanna: "I have a habit of overloading myself with things to do and then not having enough time to do them all"
Also Leanna: "i can draw ya'll fanart"
😂
Bill: <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: ~~also you can scrap the Mirio wig thing if you need the time it not that important~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye take care of yourself Leanna. Let us know if there's anything we can do ❤
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): NO ItS OK i wanna do the mirio wig
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): fhdlasfhl
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my problem is that i want to do SO MUCH all the time
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but i'll get it all done....just might not be like...immediate
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What a mood
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just came off that mode
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): With intern apps all in and cons mostly done for a while I’m just keeping pace with physics and do the stuff I “haven’t gotten around to lately”
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG i am exhausted
N🆗ri (Marisa): slep
Bill: ye.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i got more sleep at con than at school oof
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same but that's because I got to sleep past 8 every day
Aldus Larian (Jess): i was late this moring i slept til 8:30 which is when i start work
Bill: I made it to the train.
Bill: That kept me on time.
Bill: Took the ferry which takes longer to get to the office but shrug.
Bill: Stopped at the chase on the corner too to deposit excess con moneys.
Bill: My back HATES me omg
N🆗ri (Marisa): Backs HATE him! Click here to find out why!
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i'm clicking and its not telling me why
N🆗ri (Marisa): top secret
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): spoiler tag that shit
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Backs HATE him! Click here to find out why!
||*CONGRATULATIONS!* You are the 1000th visitor of this site! Enjoy your brand new computer virus!||
Bill: Hunter was *this* close to stepping on my toes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm bite back at him
he shouldn't keep calling in special favors because he knows people
Bill: Don't.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Bill: I'm not looking for anyone to fight my battles. You are staffing with him at things, and why should you burn a bridge if you don't have to? Especially if he lets it get back to other people that you argued with him and it affects you staffing (that's a worst case) (and assuming you actually like staffing).
N🆗ri (Marisa): am i coming off as standoffish
N🆗ri (Marisa): why he doin this
Bill: It's just how he is...
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't need the animenext contact page, i can just message them personally on facebook....
Bill: LOL
Bill: Mawisa you will always be my SUPER CONNECTED con friend.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm not very connected. i know people and i know of people but i don't have connections.
or if I somehow magically do I don't use them because it's not nice to use other people
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wow, Hunter's been volunteering at ANext since 2010 (or 2009) he's so cool 🙄
Aldus Larian (Jess): hunter sees anyone he knows of as a "connection" i think
Bill: *He's trying to show off yes Erik.*
Bill: Connection or a Client.
Aldus Larian (Jess): you see them as people 🎉
N🆗ri (Marisa): i see why he boils your blood. hunter seems to be assuming that i don't know people and yeah he's trying to show off after he blatantly ignored me. <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Bill: I don't do people telling me what to do unless I respect them as a superior.
Bill: He's bossy and that grates with me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel bad talking bad about him but imo he's acting superior to everyone else...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he does that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and it's annoying
Bill: He's not... always like this. To his credit.
Bill: But when it comes to cons he likes to be 'The Guy'.
Bill: Photography too, and that's why his friends are turning into clients imo.
Bill: He's really trying to get fame and more work via his famous connections.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think hunter spent alot of time being really insecure and now that he has stuff to be proud of he's gained confidence and sometimes oversells it
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats just my read tho
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He wants to be the Casey Sanders of photography
Bill: LOL that's a way to put it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): who that?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Instagram Famous Casey Sanders*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~exactly~~
Bill: Mangoloo. His famous friend.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooooooooooo
N🆗ri (Marisa): i only ever hear of mangoloo in here i don't think she's that famous
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes not super famous
Bill: She's Casey to most of our group, we've all met her.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes "famous" on the east coast simply because a lot of people know her and have met her and like her cosplays
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She's famous within the RWBY cosplay community. Outside that it's like *whomst?*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but no one outside of here knows who she is
Bill: Ye.
Bill: But because she has 20k followers and is friends with Hunter, he thinks he's on his way.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): East Coast and Texas
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): specifially austin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): exactly
Bill: "If this famous person shoots with me, other famous people will do" is not going to happen.
Bill: Well, it might, but not the way he thinks.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and not even all RWBY cosplayers know who she is
N🆗ri (Marisa): wezrez more famous
Bill: if he wants more clients, he needs to advertise like ALL the other pro photographers on facebook groups.
Bill: He can't be everyone's friendly neighborhood photographer and also photographer to the rich and famoose.
N🆗ri (Marisa): he can't ignore people and try to one-up them, and use people <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~he cant be choosy with only shooting GOOD photos for bees~~
Bill: ooooooof
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but like, most of her followers probably follow her just for her cosplays because she's a fairly attractive girl. Her influence doesn't really do anything because she's tried to promote Hunter's work on several occasions, but clearly it doesn't really do anything
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she doesnt have a lot of influence ive noticed
Bill: And to be clear, I'm not judging him for wanting to get fame and build clientele. He wants to be a serious photographer, he has to start acting like a businessman.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): shes tried to promote a lot of things
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and no one really goes for it
N🆗ri (Marisa): he has to act like a regular person <:hmmph:543192410402848769>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): unless its an event to meet her at a con
Bill: I don't like that he's leaning so hard on friends to get fame like they can just give it to him.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and yeah, after this weekend, definitely don't think his shoots are worth $45
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): one shot per pose for like 8 poses and then "I'm running out of ideas. Guess we're done"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's what it felt like~~
Bill: I don't have to worry about needing to respect his photography skills after Zenkai... That disconnect was setting off the complex I mentioned, I didn't respect him as a superior personality, but his photos were good.

It's photoshop so... different playing fields.
Bill: He's good, but very much in a different way.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Zenkai was him testing out his flash and gels
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~and charging as if he was very competent with them~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm really glad the rwby shoot worked out, but i'm a bit conflicted that it was a "personal favor" and that hunter just used kiwi. we should have used that space for all the other photoshoots that were going on, especially smaller ones, and i don't like that they're throwing their weight around to break convention rules for their own gain.
Bill: Yeeeee if I'm charging I wouldn't spend 10 minutes of the shoot showing the client photos of other people lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): ????? he did that?
Bill: For the second of Georgia's shoots he did.
Bill: While I was distracting the delaware crew who were still there.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i had permission to be saying goodbye to you outside the dealer's room, lanie and joy both knew where i was and what i was doing, and i was not needed at my post anymore and kiwi still came over to scold me do you remember ;u;
Bill: That's kinda it though. A friend wouldn't invite the her to the spot he's still got her ex around for. A pro wouldn't waste time during the shoot or have prior clients around. He doesn't have a consistent image for either type and it's like. weird.
Aldus Larian (Jess): aww she didnt scold you!
Aldus Larian (Jess): she just wanted to make sure other people didnt see u
Bill: She was telling you to watch out for people who would!
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee that's valid
N🆗ri (Marisa): still scary
Bill: Kiwi is definitely the type who expects troublesome people by default.
Aldus Larian (Jess): she said "hang out with your friends I just dont want to see you get in trouble sweetie" or something like that
N🆗ri (Marisa): i don't remember that i just remember fear and worry and self-loathing
Bill: She straight up said it before the rwby shoot 'I was expecting entitled people but since you aren't acting that way' which was basically her whole attitude.
Aldus Larian (Jess): she seemed more caring then anything
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah she's super caring!! she hugged me three times before i left
Aldus Larian (Jess): she seemed happy to see you with frens
Bill: Pretend she's me, she's yelling at you to make sure nothing bad happens to you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): there goes my anxiety 💯
Bill: *would Dominos help*
N🆗ri (Marisa): NO IT MAKES EVERYTHING 50X WORSE
Bill: *I don't have a power trip why would you ask*
N🆗ri (Marisa): thank u for organizing the rwby shoot we didn't have enough megaphones and i am not loud
Bill: Well it's what we do Mawisa.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've organized shoots but they were outside and i just rely on everyone to echo the shoot list
flora really helps too <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Bill: It may have happened because of Hunter, but if it were some disrespectful group? Kiwi would have shut us down.
Bill: Hunter or not.
Bill: We impressed her ourselves, by being the organized team we are.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah it woulda gotten shut down in a heartbeat
N🆗ri (Marisa): alisha liked my tape
N🆗ri (Marisa): safety suite was really funny it was next to karaoke so they'd have all these super important meetings with really bad anime karaoke blasting through the wall
N🆗ri (Marisa): what'shisface needs to stop spreading that there was hydrogen peroxide in the water. because there wasn't.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo was that the thing called "Artemis"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I didn't hear that rumor but I heard something about the water containers weren't cleaned out after containing alcohol so the water was getting tainted with alcohol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): forget who I heard that from
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's what happened! ^
N🆗ri (Marisa): Artemis is some kind of space simulator game that's neat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye we heard the alcohol one while waiting outside the formal
Aldus Larian (Jess): That was marisa!
Aldus Larian (Jess): marisa told us that!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok I thought so but wasn't sure
Aldus Larian (Jess): whoa i thought artemis was a super important staff room
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol nah it sounds mega important but it's a game!
N🆗ri (Marisa): ```Artemis is designed for anyone who has dreamed of what it would be like to sit on the bridge of a starship.

It simulates a spaceship bridge by networking several computers together. One computer runs the simulation and the "main screen," while the others serve as workstations for the normal jobs a bridge officer might do, like Helm, Communications, Engineering, and Weapon Control. Artemis is a social game where several players are together in one room ("bridge"), and while they all work together, one player plays the Captain - a person who sits in the middle, doesn't have a workstation, and tells everyone what to do.```
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh damnit
Aldus Larian (Jess): shit justin would have liked that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i wanted to do that
N🆗ri (Marisa): next year u gotta
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): someone remeind me next year
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): remind*
N🆗ri (Marisa): georgia u should've played too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What the FUCK why didn’t we have that info
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I could’ve been Captain Picard
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Meanwhile, I think I need to take a break from story posting because I've got some followers constantly responding to them trying to be my friend and I'm just like <:hmm:543194383885926403> <:pew:543202259085950996>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Gotta get off their radar
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yean I used to have a few people who would do that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Someone I just met this weekend was like "Hey let me know if you ever want to play Overwatch" and I'm like "ooh sorry I don't have it on PC... plus I suck..."
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): what do they say? like, actual conversation starters or oooo that's what they say
N🆗ri (Marisa): "i don't have a computer lol"
Bill: I’m low key jealous but also know I’d ignore them if anyone messaged me like that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I gotta stop accepting chat requests
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a guy that's been sending me messages for months and i just noticed oops. it's mostly stuff like "wow!" "great!" "cool!" and that's it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I also feel like I don't have enough followers to warrant the excuse that my DMs are over flooded
Bill: You don’t need to.
Bill: Have an excuse that is.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~if you do need one maybe say it's flooded with bots/spam~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m starting tea I’m being petty and passive aggressive mwuhaha
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nothing happened. Boring.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): Where’s the tea
Aldus Larian (Jess): I dunno 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): tea! tea! tea! tea! tea! tea!
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wonder how many people who said they aren't going back to zenkai really won't go back
N🆗ri (Marisa): bojo for sure. she was fuming mad when she stopped in a few minutes ago.
