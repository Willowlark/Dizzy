Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it possible to bring them but wear them on different days?
Aldus Larian (Jess): People allready planning for CCE and I don't even know what I'm wearing to zenkai
N🆗ri (Marisa): whatchu wearin to zenkai?
Aldus Larian (Jess): itsamystery.jpg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I could. I'll just have to keep my lineup private... but if there are meetups we'd probably end up wearing RWBY and BNHA on the same days
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not ruining with them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So chances are I won't be hanging out as much with them anyway
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do you think she is doing them just in hopes of pairing up with you?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Idk. She might not be, but any time I see her wanting to do a cosplay that *can* pair up with one of mine, I just assume it at this point
Aldus Larian (Jess): Fair
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~because she has a history of changing her lineup to specifically match up with me~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaaa that's awkward
Bill: Say you “aren’t planning shoots”.
Bill: Which is a good plan tbh. I basically said camera time was 11-4 or something and was drinking after that.
Bill: Do photos early to chill later.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Good idea
Bill: I bought the GoPro to have a camera later in the day but. I liked that plan.
Bill: Also Adam/Blake is NOT a ship Rebecca will run with so that’s good.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she might not ship it irl but it's still a pairing where pictures can be taken
Bill: ~~But then Erik can stab her so~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~not to dissuade u from doing it ye think of all the action stuff u could do~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I'll get Will to do Yang again with me~~
Bill: Can always have a different Blake to pair with her fem!Adam. Lord knows I won’t shoot with any other Adam I’ve met.
Bill: ~~Tom Cosplay Adam so there’s a non creepy Adam~~
Bill: No one can deny that jacket’s coolness.
Bill: Also different Blake liiiiiike Mawissssssaaaaa
N🆗ri (Marisa): das me :0
Aldus Larian (Jess): das u!
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to start working out to get **buff**
N🆗ri (Marisa): or i can cheat and get skin colored tights and stuff it with fake muscles
N🆗ri (Marisa): or **both**
Aldus Larian (Jess): for blek?
N🆗ri (Marisa): if im doin male blake? is that what im doin
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo i have no clue XD
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I'll be Adam
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Someone make me Adam
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Adams cool outside of being a total piece of shit 🙏
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Gotta have his cool sword tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeahhh
Bill: Be Adam!
N🆗ri (Marisa): Be Adam!
Bill: I considered it for a hot second too, but. Adam’s look sort of requires not being round. Anyone can cosplay anything blah blah blah, but like. He’s supposed to be your edgy hot but seriously fucked up ex and that just don’t work without the dose of hot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Be Adam!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): More like *bee* Adam amitire?
Bill: Looool
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Can erik and I stab you
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Itll be like nier all over again
Bill: That’s literally the reason for him to do it. We have GOOD fight choreography to pull from for that.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _hes copying me again_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i need a counter for each time hal boots up league after me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i didnt get lux on my last pick
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so hal starts jumping through hoops to get her for me
N🆗ri (Marisa): can he not
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He popped into my lobby and said knock knock
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I almost spat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He must’ve really wanted to play together 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): MIXED SIGNALS MCGEE
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I h8 boys
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like he's trying waaaaaay too hard to "be on good terms"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah and I started talking too and hal was all “don’t listen to your BF, play league with me”
N🆗ri (Marisa): WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG
N🆗ri (Marisa): even jokingly that's too much
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wooooow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SO WEIRD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think at some point you're just going to have to tell Hal off. Like, he needs to realize you don't want to be buddy buddy with him anymore
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah: I know someone who dyed their hair red
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal: hehe me too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 😒
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, once I was talking to a girl and we were hitting it off and almost became a thing. Things went south and didn't work out and I tried doing the buddy thing and it made her uncomfortable and she told me off. I felt like shit but it knocked some sense into me
Aldus Larian (Jess): Georgia tell off Hal, Erik tell off Rebecca you guys can do it together
N🆗ri (Marisa): if he's as buddy buddy as he's trying to be he'll take a scolding in stride
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like idk why he wants to be friends
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t see any advantage to being his friend?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s kinda annoying now?
N🆗ri (Marisa): this is just like those megurine luka song
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~MEGurine~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Anna said Hal looked big sad at Katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But _per usual_ he hasn’t communicated to me what he wants
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Friendship or whatever? Nope hasn’t said a word to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Last time he actually tried to communicate with me maturely, he said to never talk to or approach him in person again
N🆗ri (Marisa): He was harsh to you, push back and be harsh to him
Aldus Larian (Jess): *so tell me whatcha want watcha really really want* 🎵
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): he congratualted me with the heart icon 👀
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🏹  ——> 💔
N🆗ri (Marisa): pew pew pew
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://media.esportsedition.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/greatshotcalling-lol.jpg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you can choose _any three_ of these icons
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and he chooses the _heart one_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): maybe overreacting but ALSO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and he stops playing as soon as i cant play anymore
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): https://media1.tenor.com/images/bbe6cd1dd6a8cd80f6776238b2319925/tenor.gif?itemid=8620816
Bill: You keep saying your confused, it’s the same thing every single time. He wants to be friends. You don’t. He doesn’t know that. People who don’t want to be friends with someone don’t usually consistently accept their invitations to play games on voice chat past midnight so he thinks his attempts at reconciliation are working and you’re <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971> by that.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Can you like, remove him from your League friends list? Or block him? Not sure how all that works :/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, if you don't want to play with him, you shouldn't have to
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but in other news, I got my Marauder pics back from Will and they're really cool but kind of dark and since he asked to credit him for editing the photos I feel bad trying to lighten them up with Insta filters...... so I didn't.....
Bill: Occasionally it’s an artistic choice.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but we're all wearing dark clothing... shooting in a dark area...
Bill: I kept the white balance blue tinted on the Nier shoots cause it felt more Nier. I dunno how noticeable it is, but warm skin tones clashed with androids.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Original
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Brightened up so you can actually distinguish my clothes from each other
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~also he sent them via Messenger so goodbye quality~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~they were shot in the dark so not very sharp images to begin with~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I shouldn't really complain because it was a free shoot and Breanna is just starting to learn photography~~
Bill: Shot with what?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Some kind of good camera
Bill: Lol that works.
Bill: meanwhile day 3 of stuck at 1 pound higher than the weight I was stuck at for 4 or 5 days I'm read to strange... not sure what.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it the moon
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *> tells people to comment their Hogwarts house on my new post
> weird kid from Katsu replies to my story instead*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, he was nice and all, but like... just awkward...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like he wanted to talk to me more but didn't know what to say...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had no idea what else to say
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then he did that "sorry for bothering you, you don't hate me do you?" thing
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): mood but also that sounds manipulative to say to someone you just met wow
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yikes
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): hard pass
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~he's from PA and is going to be at Zenkai~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ohhh nooooooooooo
Bill: You lot need to be less popular and likable.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~a ghillie suit would come in handy, huh?~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): do you think he like has a crush on you? or like maybe has autism or something?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): probably the latter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was getting some autism vibes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and not to stereotype but he had kind of a higher pitched feminine voice so might also be gay and crushing on me?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but it was really weird because I encountererd him 4 times at Katsu. First time on Friday while I was wearing Tai, second time on Saturday when I was wearing Tai again, third time at the dance (which somehow they let him in wearing jeans and a t-shirt???), and then fourth time at the fucking *rooftop bar*
Aldus Larian (Jess): maybe he was like follwing yout hrough stories on insta?
N🆗ri (Marisa): I noticed about midway through the ball that a bunch of people were in super casual clothing, despite them turning away formal attire at the door that didn’t fit the dress code
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea like at the beginning they were picky and then at the end they were like "whatever goes!"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *> sees Meg's story post where she's wearing Pink Floyd undies
> tries to compliment them (because they're my favorite band) without sounding weird or creepy
> decides against it because you can't*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea i was trying to think of a way
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): theres is none
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): especially since the post itself was about her socks
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~to be fair, she couldve worn shorts~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:hmm:543194383885926403>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~you right~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i want them
Aldus Larian (Jess): but also ye. plus u not creep ™ but i could see how you would feel awkward
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Nice undies <:pew:543202259085950996> (but not in a creepy way)"*
Bill: the finger gunshelp.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Finger guns always help
Aldus Larian (Jess): I have so much work to do yet here i am, sittin on tumblr
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh shit, same jess
Aldus Larian (Jess): the sense of impending doom just makes it more exciting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Meg tea? owo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): eh not really. she's just wearing cool panties
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone just hit the building XD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO???????
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /squints remember when she said “be careful what you do, young people follow you georgia”
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think it was delivery truck
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ur amazon package has arrived
Aldus Larian (Jess): OMG theres hole in the building now 👌
N🆗ri (Marisa): WOO
New window
Aldus Larian (Jess): if he hit any harder it would have came through my coworkers wall
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): it's for airflow
N🆗ri (Marisa): Interesting phone glitch
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): don't worry
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): Do you get to go home for the day now
Aldus Larian (Jess): PFFT
Aldus Larian (Jess): thats a funny joke
Bill: Whenever I fucking compliment an IBMer, the next week they prove freaking incompetent.
Bill: Fuck today.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): same
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Who'd've thought a dark grainy photo would be doing better than my other posts 😅
Aldus Larian (Jess): its moody 👌
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): emo never died
N🆗ri (Marisa): hows that cool hole in the wall doing
Aldus Larian (Jess): pretty good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Scott boosted his most recent post
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Interesting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m feelin a little skeptical bout him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He very fun and kind but I’m suspecting a little... idk what
Bill: I always trust my gut.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My gut said nothing until his reaction with Marisa’s photos
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like he said “finally” got photos back like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:BOI:549661126141411351>
Aldus Larian (Jess): yeaaa.....
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Those photos were 🐨 🍵, they were 🆓, what else do you want
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not to mention I was the one asking Marisa FOR him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which was like, a personal favor, and Marisa was a Kind Soul™️ for agreeing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the fact that he’s boosted his most recent post makes me just a little more skeptical
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s still fun and supportive but I think I’ll definitely be more sensitive to see if he has any “fame-wanting” tendencies
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): "boosted" as in "paid dollars so more people would see it"?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): does he have a facebook cosplay page?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): because fb has been trying to force me to boost posts by  "giving me 15$ worth for FREE :D"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was on Instagram
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t think they translate cause I get the FB notifier but not IG
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And yeah boosted as in paid human dollars
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think if you connect your insta posts to FB
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): cause it was showing instagram posts in the preview of the boosts
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): and i was like  ....mmm i'd rather not
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Doesn’t show any FB for him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): rip
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): funny, I didn't see the boosted post
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): but
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also I went to dinner with him and peter and gen and Chris and the famous Texas RWBY people
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): unless maybe because I already saw it when he posted yesterday?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I tried to Segway Scott into their friend group cause they live in the same state
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I was successful cause I’m friends with a decent amount of those people
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I’m hoping Scott doesn’t let it go to his head or turn out to be shitty
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause then it’s my fault for introducing him to people 😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Also cause before they knew I was friends with Scott, they were kinda blowing him off 😬😬😬😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ahhhh fame is bad, I’m changing my name to hermit cosplay
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Aldus Larian (Jess): GOD IDEA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh and the "$15 free for connecting to Facebook" there's probably a catch where you have to pay something and then they'll give you $15 towards promotions
Bill: I don’t like him. Didn’t day I met him.
N🆗ri (Marisa): insta has a boost post feature? oh gosh i hope it doesn't get annoying like facebook's because i get ads every day "pay us $5 so 2 more people can see you post!" on facebook
yeah i was feeling a little iffy after sending scott the pictures. i know my photos aren't good and I took a while to get them back and he seemed good humored during the shoot but he didn't say thanks or anything. i saw he got the files at 2pm and then messaged him at 8pm to make sure he got them ok and he just said "ye" and i thought "ok.jpeg maybe he hasn't looked at them yet"
Bill: There’s something to his attitude when we were gathering that felt... selfish? Uncaring? Not sure.
Bill: I trust my gut.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wanna give him the benefit of the doubt like maybe he doesn't express himself very well
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean he acts like he’s friends with Meg and then shit talks her to me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So he’s at least a little two faced
N🆗ri (Marisa): he "finally" got his photos back but a lot of paid photographers haven't even sent their photos out yet <:BOI:549661126141411351>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm.... a little guilty of that too.....
Bill: There’s a difference Erik.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): did he say the "finally" thing in a story post that's already expired?
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~i felt bad i loitered around their game of unicorns after hearing he likes starryshyroo but now i don't. also she invited me so maybe she didn't want to be alone with him?~~
Bill: From the screen caps Georgia sent he’s openly shitting on Meg to Georgia and possibly he’s doing the same thing back.
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: You are friends with Meg, but you have your loyalties to other people. You don’t pretend to be closer to Meg than you are.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh yeah I saw that yesterday
N🆗ri (Marisa): i didn't know you can see old stories if you're tagged in them that's a neat loophole
Aldus Larian (Jess): the "finally" is so passive aggressive
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Meg posts to her story screencaps from her convos with Scott all the time like they’re BFFLS
Bill: Yeah. PA as fuck.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~i wondered why he never wanted anything to do with me even after i went out of my way to say hi to him, but just realized i unfollowed him on insta awhile ago and he prob is salty about that~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~but he posts the same kind of photos like..all the time and it's boring~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): i didnt follow himm till after katsu 😬
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like he's also doing the "try-hard" thing a little bit as well, but like, he doesn't really go out of his way to get photos done to get content, nor does he actively work on making new cosplays
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Try hard without the try? lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Don’t get me wrong I love hearin the gossip he has and he’s fun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I don’t EMOTIONALLY trust him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is fine, people can have friends like they
Bill: Or vouch for him, which you have done.
Bill: ~~he's not rooming with us again~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel that. Like, fun to hang out with and talk to but not get into deep personal conversations
Bill: Not that i know what Katsu looks like next year but.
Bill: I don't trust him.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He was really nice to me after the hal break up
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I spent a lot of that time assessing who the fake friends were
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): NOT IN THE GET IN THE PANTS WAY
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ok, phew!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): In the “if you need anything just ask” way
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was a very shitty georgia at that point so it meant a lot to me
Bill: Don't be quick to believe her, there's a chat from last year where she said "Guys I just got hit on for the first time ever".
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wait, whomst?
Bill: Georgia.
Bill: Very long time ago.
Bill: Not this chat, fyi. Before even Aurii.
Bill: But anyway.
Bill: Everyone was nice to you after the break up. Some decidedly cause they knew you were single, I'm sure.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My sophomore year some rando guy came up to me and put his number in my phone
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean yes
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But also Scott seemed truly happy to hear about Noah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): BUT I DONT READ SOCIAL CUES WELL SOOOOOOO
Bill: I noticed.
Bill: That's not a sin.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like meg didn’t give a shit about me and that’s when I was like ok
Bill: or fault, or what have you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone complimented scott's smile in the pic he posted ~~i photoshopped that smile~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): alot of people dont read them well...
Bill: You
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She stopped answering Instagram messages or snapping me and when I tried to talk to her about advice she said “she’s not playing the he said she said games
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): why is 2019 becoming the year of underlying drama and fake people... (._.)
Aldus Larian (Jess): when its others they can read things but when its themselves its harder
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Because were throwing out people that don’t spark joy
Bill: Erik: You've just realized what Genuine friendships look like.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): RIDE OR DIE
Bill: I love BNE, but I keep them at arms length. That applied to you and Leanna too, even if there was a growing trust looks like.
Aldus Larian (Jess): eh theres always underlying drama, i observe from a distnace
Bill: The wider your circle, the more drama you can get involved in. The more you invest in those wider members of the circle, the more powerful the drama.
Bill: Keep in mind who you trust with what you say, that's the secret to a drama free lifestyle.
Bill: Nothing stays private.
Bill: You can trust I'm not going to turn around to Rebecca and tell her your frustrations, for example.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm not used to tight knit groups lol. High school I was a drifter and had a bunch of different friend groups and even the one I was closest in, I got excluded from certain conversations and then suddenly there was drama and I had no idea what was going on and who wasn't talking to who and it was really upsetting
Bill: I trust you when I criticize Hunter it doesn't go back to him. Or even the Scott comments, I said I didn't like him from the start. I knew Georgia wouldn't turn around and tell him that.
Bill: You a pure boi. We like your type.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~we like people who will chill and hang on a Saturday night and still text you after you leave to make sure you get home okay cause we’re ADULTS~~
Bill: It's a terribly specific example but okay.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Fake friends don’t care if you get home safe
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/himym-thats-love-bitch-high-five-couple-gif-4243543
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH
Bill: There are better signs of fake friendship. I'm going to care if anyone gets home safe, especially if they've been drinking because I'm responsible.
Bill: Says nothing about if I like them or not.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean all my Real Friends have the “text me when you’re home safe “ policy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So I always thought that a good indicator
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Justin does it when I’m like 25 mins away, I used to tease him about that
Bill: I'm *not* expert on the subject cause *lol I'm the V memes I make*, but I find real friends are the ones that think about you when you aren't around. They're close enough to you that they send you some random thing cause it made them think about you. You're a part of their life.
Bill: That coupled with a trust between the two makes for a real strong relationship.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Truuuu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Speaking of real friends, in lighter news, David got a girlfriend!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): @echoblaze.cos
Bill: That was super obvious and he's a pure boi.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): awwwwwwwwwwwwww
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats cute as heck
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA I SAW THAT
Bill: I didn't realize it was official but his story post is just 💞
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye they official
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s talking to me about her
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Y’all I’m ready to cry in the dining hall he’s so pure and excited
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s like “we’re going to a con and then I’ll take her out to dinner!”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I’m like 😭😭😭😭 you’re too good
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I know the mom thing is a total joke but I’m really proud of how David has been able to find his own in the cosplay community
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMFAO
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I JUSF SNORTED MT@YOUGRY
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): sdfjkfjkfjkfjkfjkalfh
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THE SOUND I JUST MADEfdshasdlhl
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THERES YOGURT IN MY@NOSE NOW
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I DID NOT EXPECT THAT
Bill: Oof distance tho. Echoblaze in the midwest right?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye but they call every night
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So apparently it okay
Bill: I am apparently senpai, yes Erik.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): David seems the type to make it work
Bill: Oh I'm all for it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Omg I can’t scroll up cause every time I look I laugh again
Bill: If anyone can.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Biru Senpai*
Bill: it David.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m wheezing
Bill: ~~But where's the cute kouhai who wants me to notice her~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): Biru this isnt about u it about david
Bill: *I self depreciate at any given opportunity, especially when I'm subject of a meme*
Bill: See, I replied to his story and we just went back and forth in all caps about how he a good Boi ™
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m gonna cry into my cereal he’s too good
Bill: I wanna congratulate him but I'm not supposed to know 😭
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ask him how he’s doin and when he says good say you’re very glad for him
Bill: Plz, social engineering already in work.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): David is like the puppy that runs to the door and loves you when you come home from work
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I could never be upsetti with David around
Bill: rip he did not elaborate, but I'm also not super close to him.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea he is a positive energy boi
Bill: He's pure sunshine.
Bill: ~~Too much, when he's online~~
Bill: He likes *every* message I send in a DM.
Bill: All of them.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): >.> i'm guilty of doing that too sometimes ...
Bill: 😛
Bill: It fine.
Bill: Or rather, it's not a bad thing.
Bill: at all.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea i do that alot too although i dont dm much
N🆗ri (Marisa): if you don't like someone's message how will they know you've seen it and appreciate it :0
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>  exactly
Bill: I'm just not quite so EXPRESSIVE online, unless I have text formatting.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): how will they know i love and appreciate them if i don't like every single message
