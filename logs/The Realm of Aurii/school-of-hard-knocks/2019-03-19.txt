Bill: Photog still gets a notification via mention. So you aren’t hiding the filter by not using the photo tag.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah but it doesn't show up on their profile
Bill: Oooh I see.
Bill: ~~I don’t give a fuck so it’s just Hunter~~
Bill: Though I hope my develop is good enough you don’t need filters <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Confirmed I didn’t put a filter on the post I posted today
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't put filters on because I'm afraid of offending the photographer
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I guess I'll stop doing that then
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): First internship rejection letter
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s rough
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oof :/
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aww I'm sorry!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Curse u Vanderbilt university
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): At least it’s not nasa tho lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess the ideal scenario is getting rejected from everything except nasa cause I’m supposed to hear back from them last
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Rejection still sucks tho
Bill: I doubt Rebecca cares?
Bill: filters, not internships.
Bill: That sucks Georgia.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye sucks butt but it’ll be ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ye but I apply same rules to everyone unless they say otherwise
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nathaniel messaged me?
Bill: For...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Holy moly
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): DAS A LOT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Bill: That’s a lot of words. Enough I zoned out half way through it.
Bill: What are you going to say?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Holy shit
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I never thought nathaniel was a bad noodle
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think he’s become very much more self aware
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mel said that he was framed by angry jigglypuff at katsu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And clearly angryjiggly has ISSUES
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think most people will be given to forgiving him
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Maybe except for meg
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~like I care about her opinion tho~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk what to say but I’m not keen on being mean to him or ignoring him
Bill: Hmm.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Not sure what to say tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm afraid to unblock him from Facebook for fear of getting that wall of text
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because I wouldn't know how to respond
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _as I currently don’t know how to respond_
Bill: ~~So much for him learning boundaries~~
Bill: Vulnerability and communication is one thing but to people who were barely involved, probably across the entire east coast?
Bill: Do you want my opinion?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Sure
Bill: “I accept your apology.” Short and sweet. Don’t ask questions, don’t reach out. Maybe a second sentence that’s a bit personal, to show it’s not a insincere answer. Not questioning, not opening a thread, just. Generic nice. 

Keep your distance, let him prove his new leaf when he’s around you.
Bill: Look listen and think from yourself here on out.
Bill: Not that you haven’t been. But give him his clean slate but keep the distance.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So like a skeptical clean slate
Bill: To him, clean slate. No good or bad from before. For you? Be skeptical and wary cause everyone south of Delaware is fucking insane in the cosplay fandom.
Bill: Famous people are also insane.
Bill: People who are best friend who’ve only talked over Instagram? Iinnnnnsane.
Bill: Trust should be earned, and evaluated case by case by what you see them say and do.
Bill: He’s in some backwoods southern state and totally detached from you. You can’t see him, or his actions beyond this. Give him a generous take, that he’s being sincere right now, but believe what you see him do down the line.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean up until now my experiences have been helpful and pleasant and whatever
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s everyone else’s rumors, which turned out to be wrong, that gave me doubts
Bill: Wipe those both clean. My ~~supposed to be short~~ approach isn’t based on the rumors and actions, it’s how I would deal with any distant, drama involved person who wants to be friends. Form opinions for myself, but don’t commit to friendship till I feel safe doing so.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 😑 mmmmm Idk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 👍🏻
N🆗ri (Marisa): Big type
Bill: Yup, he considers you a good friend even though you don’t really know each other. Thatttts why I say keep some distance till that’s a real thing.
Bill: Good answer.
Bill: Idk, I’m wary of overly familiar people. More often than not it’s fake.
Bill: Actually I’m wary of all people. My trust is earned.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I’m more trusting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean what’s the worst he could do ya know
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he helped me set up my YouTube channel without any hesitation
Bill: Plenty of things.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 😑
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Realistically
Bill: I’ve never met him. I dunno what he could or couldn’t do.
N🆗ri (Marisa): thanos in disguise
Bill: I’ve seen people do some insane shit. Like everything jigglypuff ever did.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk I don’t think he can actually do that much harm
Bill: Anyway I’m not your dad. I meant to keep my opinion short and I screwed that up. Just think your choices through.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just like don't give him your social security number
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <:pew:543202259085950996> I completely forgot all the info about the drama surrounding him
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Eyyy
Bill: When your psychology audiobook straight up agrees with my points yesterday. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: > Woman describing the moment she found herself with self confidence: “my therapist asked me if nothing changed, my weight, my career, my successes, would I still be okay. I said yes”
> Me: aww how inspiring, self acceptance
> woman, next sentence in interview: “That, and I met a wonderful man who really saw me for me”
> 😑
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ughhhh, so the sugery for the gallbladder went well but it didn't help. So they are birthing the baby today so Jess and her mom are on their way to the hospital
Bill: Oh damn.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh my... thanks for keeping us updated. Hope all goes well
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Give Jess our love ❤
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh wow. Oh wow. That’s very early. Best of luck.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah...
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Annoys me so much they they took her organ out for no reason
Bill: Yeah... but the risk of that is less than the risk of what they have to do now right?
Bill: ~~Should I... say something that Hunter's magically tag the photographer idea isn't important to everyone, and a portfolio via instagram is a mistake due to image quality?~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'd let it slide unless it's a super big deal to you. i agree that it's a bit off-base but 🤷
N🆗ri (Marisa): or actually you could give your two cents if you phrase it differently
N🆗ri (Marisa): that might be good
Bill: It feels like I don't want to let it slide, but I'm not sure why. If I just want to drag on Hunter's idea cause I don't like to be spoken for, I don't want to do it, but it is objectively better to not put a Portfolio on instagram.
N🆗ri (Marisa): then you can write about it from an objective way. as a cosplayer it's good to be tagged in things because it's your face, but as a photographer I think people are more likely to check the description? i've never checked a photog's tagged posts only their main feed
Bill: *yolo*
N🆗ri (Marisa): OwO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Probably same reason he doesn't upload photos to a drive to distribute
N🆗ri (Marisa): what's that reason
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): something dumb probably
N🆗ri (Marisa): if he keeps trying to grow his photography gig i can feel that someday someone is gonna call him out for not sending high quality images
Bill: And *I'm* the one whose worried about digging him.
Bill: Hunter definitely a stubborn one.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh, he was running out of space in his Drive
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and didn't want to make another
Bill: But if he wants to be serious about photography he has to act like it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): so you make a new 
o
rip
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but like, you could put stuff in the Drive and send link to customer, explain that link will only be active for X many weeks before being deleted to make space for new shoots
N🆗ri (Marisa): he seems like the person to always look back on his past photos and he probably deletes the originals off the SD card or something
Bill: ~~who doesn't clear their sd cards~~
Bill: And he should be considering a website if he wants to be a pro. Flickr pro is 50 bucks for unlimited high res storage.
Bill: a year.
N🆗ri (Marisa): im so angry at myself for losing an important SD card in my move back to the us it had a lot of great pictures on it i hadn't gotten to yet
oh. is clearing their sd cards a thing people do.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, the Google Drive upgrade prices aren't that bad
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i use mine too much they get corrupted
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): $20/yr for 100GB, $30/yr for 200GB
Bill: Yes. I clear the SD cards and put the images on an external hard drive, cause I'd have a few dozen SD cards by now if I didn't.
Bill: I also back up the photos to our NAS at home.
Bill: It's 2 bucks for 50 gigs, that's already pretty great.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo. ain't got no money for an external hard drive
what's an nas
Bill: Fancy external hard drive.
Bill: You know what.
Bill: I have a few older drives.
Bill: I don't use them anymore cause we have the NAS, I'mma give you one.
N🆗ri (Marisa): **do not**
N🆗ri (Marisa): those things are expensive
Bill: May not be SUPER reliable anymore, but still gives you two copies.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've been practicing high kicks
Bill: These? These are basically garbage now.
Bill: I mean it, they're old.
N🆗ri (Marisa): and drop kicks. i may be too short to kick ur face but i can kick shins. watch out. karate emoji
N🆗ri (Marisa): keep the items in your possession and nobody gets hurt
Bill: It is *literally* a paperweight in my house.
Bill: I have *multiple*.
Bill: *of the paperweight variety*
N🆗ri (Marisa): those papers aren't gonna weight themselves
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am unable to repay any acts of kindness i can't even draw a hand for your catgirl
Bill: *I have actual paperweights for that*
N🆗ri (Marisa): is this one of them
Bill: no.
Bill: How many SD cards do you have? What size are they?
N🆗ri (Marisa): many
N🆗ri (Marisa): 11 years of anime conventions worth of sd cards, ranging from 8gb in the early years when cards were really expensive to 16-32 nowadays
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a shoebox of them somewhere
Bill: ,... Are you crazy.
Bill: How do you FIND anything.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i search for like an hour, text bojo "do you know where x is" and then 90% of the time it magically appears. the other 10% of the time i either need to look for something else to find it or replace it and it'll appear in an obvious spot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh for sd cards i just try every one until i find what i need
Bill: I love you Marisa but sometimes I wanna strangle you.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i welcome death <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Not allowed.
N🆗ri (Marisa): play the sims invite him to a party
Bill: I'll look at what I have when I get home.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah look at all your great past pictures. take a trip down memory lane.
Bill: Maybe this can be my motivation to clear the hard drives in my old desk top.
Bill: Cause again, dead weight.
N🆗ri (Marisa): build a neat pyramid
Bill: The NAS has... 18? lets say 18 terabytes of storage on it. I only use the external hard drive for my photos cause it faster.
Bill: so only need the two things.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's like more storage than the government omg
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wonder if i can go home because there's nothing to do again, the girls who were on vacation are back, and my legs hurt from kneeling
N🆗ri (Marisa): they took up the two computer desks and the third here doesn't have a chair
Bill: Go home.
N🆗ri (Marisa): permission from our merciful president has been obtained <:rise:557579163511554050>
N🆗ri (Marisa): ye he said was ok!
N🆗ri (Marisa): they'll e-mail me any work <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: ~~they better not you worked probono overnight~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): naw overnight i worked on meowth which im gonna go do now
it's not as good as i was hoping. i made the head too small.
Bill: It's an iterative process.
N🆗ri (Marisa): taidaima
Bill: Is that 'I'm a weeb' in japanese. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): sensei suddenly doubles over and weeps
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have no idea how to make the ryo on its forehead
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess how u doin
Aldus Larian (Jess): Umm stressed
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): nice
Aldus Larian (Jess): But I got us here! We're in the waiting room, she's delivering now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sending love and prayers that all goes well 💕
Bill: Yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thank you guys ♥️
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So hunter sounds like he wants the tagging system more for advertisement than portfolio
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I get that
Bill: So. Not advertising.
Bill: He wants.
Bill: To have two sections.
Bill: of photos.
Bill: because.
Bill: one isn't good enough?
Bill: Alright Erik nailed it, that's a stupid reason to make a big deal out of tag versus mention.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well I'm an Aunt! No idea how baby is yet but she was born like 10 mins ago
Bill: WOOOOOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): have you decided on an Aunt Name™ for yourself
aunt jess. auntie jess. tia jess. jessy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YAY BABY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): my cousins baby uses the polish word for aunt so I’m “ciocia georgia” cause the baby otherwise doesn’t have any aunts
Aldus Larian (Jess): Aunt Jess prob cuz that's what my bf calls me for her daughter
Bill: ~~if you don't care about traction, why are you trying to use instagram to get a following outside of your friend group~~
Bill: Hunter is very confused.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I just hope she's ok we haven't heard about what condition she's in
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): congrats! glad they were able to BORTH the baby!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): hope everything else is going alright with baby and sister-in-law ❤
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea me too thank you ♥️
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I understand where hunters coming from
N🆗ri (Marisa): are you in the waiting room? what's playing on the tv in the waiting room
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s not a photographer perspective it’s a business one
Bill: If it was a business one, he'd be more interested in the traction.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I'm on the waiting room some guys with a giant pet spider was just on tv
N🆗ri (Marisa): not optimal viewing material
Aldus Larian (Jess): Now they are talking about musicals
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo which one
Aldus Larian (Jess): Bing bang theory? It's apparently got an adaptation now
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh no
N🆗ri (Marisa): gross
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's scary
N🆗ri (Marisa): my hebrew school went on a field trip to a musical once and i guess the audience was all schools because at one point the characters start talking about where they graduated from and certain sections of the crowd start going wild each time a name is called. then the one sunglasses wearing greased hair bad boy™ in the play goes "oh yeah? well I flunked out of temple emmanuel hebrew school" and it was great
Aldus Larian (Jess): She's ok!
Bill: ***WOOOOO***
N🆗ri (Marisa): w e w
N🆗ri (Marisa): do they have a postpartum plan for her
Bill: I read that as postmortum and I was like.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): WOOO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Both it baby?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Ha haha I doubt it seeing as they didn't even know they were deliving toll 2 hours ago
N🆗ri (Marisa): valid
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yes just said as far as he know everything is ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): My brother I mean
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Awesome
N🆗ri (Marisa): she might stay in the hospital for a while to make sure there are no complications, especially because the child is super premature right? my sister in law stayed for like two weeks after her first delivery.
N🆗ri (Marisa): theyve got little human incubators
Aldus Larian (Jess): The baby's prob gonna be in the hospital for a long time not sure about her. Yea shell prob be in an incubator in NICU
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Some woman is trying to sue my moms dealership as a “not woman friendly business” 😮
Bill: ,... the business owned by a woman?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): if she was experiencing hypertension while pregnant then it's possible she may experience severe preeclampsia afterwards so the hospital may want to keep her a few weeks. hopefully since she's already delivered things will get better but often after labor is a tough time.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea technically the HELLP sydrome they think she had is a type of prclampcia
Aldus Larian (Jess): Baby is 2lbs 10oz
Bill: That's. V light right?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): At least she's over 2lb. The HELLP article said babies under 2lbs don't fare well so hopefully this baby will be okay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _my ex girlfriend messaged me asking for old cosplay pics_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😬
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~Leanna, in the distance: wait you’re not straight?~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LISTEN, I DIDNT KNOW
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My favorite thing is when Hal asked “wait who” and everyone left him on read
N🆗ri (Marisa): She asked for pictures from you in a group chat? <:thinku:543194478614413318>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Not privately?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah privately
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _homestuck cosplay pics_
Bill: she's talking about some chat in the past when Hal was involved.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeee
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oooo
Everyone needs homestuck pics tho that’s like water
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Leanna put “wait you’re not straight?” In out of context and hal asked who the quote was about and no one answered him
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg hahaha
Bill: Oooh, that was when you did your rwby sleepover.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nah geekdom
Bill: Must not have been around when it was said.
Bill: still valid.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): At that cursed bob Evans
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause I told a story with some other purpose and everyone was just thinking “did she just say ex girlfriend”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I was like ye I dated a girl for 9 months
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t really know what to identify as tbh, I’ve been in the last 3 relationships with boys
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But I’d have no problem dating a girl, I don’t really mind
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wow she’s still funny
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): Still furry :3c
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s dating some guy and got a dog
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s improvement from 4 years ago
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Noah is an outlier, my three people I dated before him were all less academically minded by a LOT
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ....my furry son, jack,  is like best friends with her I'm screaming
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): REALLY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): the fur community is pretty tight knit apparently
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA LMAO THEY DO LIKE FURSUIT TRADE OFFS AND STUFF IM SO SHOOK
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SMALL WORLD
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Fucking weird
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm convinced all furries know eachother
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Super small world
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think she’s like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Furfamous
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or like as recognizable and I can be in cosplay
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): W e I r d
Aldus Larian (Jess): I get to see baby soon!

N🆗ri (Marisa): she got the same last name as u used to!
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's common for kids in japan not to have a name for like a week isn't that weird what do you call the kid for a week
N🆗ri (Marisa): "hey punk! don't cry it's ok! :)"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea you do t have to name your kid right away but most people do
N🆗ri (Marisa): suddenly homestuck makes sense
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Wow she's already 1 years old in Korea!
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoa yea you're right!

N🆗ri (Marisa): they should know
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And she'll be 2 on New Year's Day?
N🆗ri (Marisa): child is born

Aldus Larian (Jess): Only 2 people can go into NICU at a time so I'm just here in an empty waiting room with like one old dude
N🆗ri (Marisa): prepare your salutations
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oh no what if she doesn't like me?
N🆗ri (Marisa): need a new baby, return it
Aldus Larian (Jess): At least I don't have to worry about having to try to hold her
Aldus Larian (Jess): She in a box
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow she's finnish
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): box baby box baby
Aldus Larian (Jess): If I ever have to stay in the hospital I'm bringing video games
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nintendo DS YEET
