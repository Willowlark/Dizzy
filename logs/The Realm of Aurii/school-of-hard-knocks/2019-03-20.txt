Aldus Larian (Jess): The baby actually looks really good everything considered
N🆗ri (Marisa): ready for hollywood already
N🆗ri (Marisa): not even 2 hours to get herself ready and lookin' fine wow
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): What is meant by “cosplayers who rely on photography” is he speaking of patreon
Bill: No idea.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also "cosplayers who rely on photography...need it..." Is he still talking about tagging your photogs?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Don’t all cosplayers rely on photography
Bill: Yeah.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): 
N🆗ri (Marisa): I thought that first pic was a new car oops
Tell her we say hi!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So smol 😮
Aldus Larian (Jess): She so tiny! But she looks great! She's moving and crying and she had hicups
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Aldus Larian (Jess): She opened her eyes a little too and when my brother touched her she reached out and touched him back
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Awwww
Aldus Larian (Jess): When I was born my brother bought me a pink elephant from the gift shop so I went to the gift shop and got her one and my brother was like 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's so fucking cute 😭
Bill: Yo. Fuck nelnet. They charged me two bucks interest in between the time i paid off the ALL of it and the payment processing.
Bill: I.
Bill: Think I came into NYC and the entire dev group is at Armonk again.
Aldus Larian (Jess): opps
Bill: They have a *Monday Tuesday* schedule damnit.
Bill: They didn't even go in yesterday.
Bill: Fuck.
Bill: If I'm the only one here, I'm leaving early.
Bill: Jing isn't on vacation anymore and came here.
Bill: Not alone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): so what did i miss in interent land over the past day?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): a whole lot of nothing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Google+ is shutting down! Save your content!
Aldus Larian (Jess): SHIT omg what am i gonna do without google plus
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmaoooo
Bill: stress.
Aldus Larian (Jess): NEAT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This man called my mom personally to tell her about his sister dying last year and she had a GMC so now he wants one
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oof
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess that really could’ve done without the context
Bill: I mean. Yeah.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My mom feels so awkward because she’s tryna email him a coupon to be nice but he doesn’t have an email
N🆗ri (Marisa): oof. is he really old?
N🆗ri (Marisa): mail it?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye he sounds old
N🆗ri (Marisa): he sounds very lonely
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My mom hangs up and goes “he told me about his sister dying of ovarian cancer and his heart attack right after and I wanna catch this guy a break”
Bill: Katy is *officially* moving out with Erik on April 15th.
Bill: They're getting an apartment in PA.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh sweet, I better get packig
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Bill: They found a place in like, 2 weeks, moving out as soon as possible.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): god I wish that were me
Bill: She asked mom and dad to help her over the phone and they were like “if you were doing it on a weekend”.
Bill: Which to be fair, I’m not taking a day off for it either.
Bill: But she can't wait. Parents think it's a bad idea, even if Erik has been ~~actually~~ a little more sociable recently.
Bill: Hopefully when she gets her dream come true of no one in the house she doesn't distance herself. =/
Aldus Larian (Jess): where are they moving too?
Bill: Not sure. She's on vacation with Erik in NC seeing Katy's BFF, mom didn't mention the town.
Bill: It's closer to his work/school and she's going to commute an hour~hour and half now.
Bill: So into PA a ways.
N🆗ri (Marisa): so she's sacrificing stuff to move in with him
Bill: Some what yes. Which is to be expected, it's give and take. She just has chronic tunnel vision and may be too narrowed in on 'not living at home' (which is bullshit, she's barely home and when she is she spends all her time in her room), living with Erik (who she basically already does), and her own space (which is totally justified).
Bill: She's probably rushing imo. I'd say it makes more sense closer to the summer. But.
Bill: She wants it.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye she rushing but alot of people do that so either shell regret it and theyll move somewhere else next year or shell be ok and things will just be different
Bill: Yeah. Can't stop her.
Bill: It is what she's wanted since college ended, so I get it, and moving in with her year+ boyfriend (even he's basically ignored her family this whole time) makes more sense than a rando. S'long as she put the minimum thought like 'can I pay my students loans, the new car I want to lease, and rent all together', she'll. manage.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~"Don't Stop Me Now" plays in the background~*
Bill: Remind me to show you the scars I have from her as a kid man. Always was unstoppable.
Bill: She goes through phases of 'this is what I want, period the end' and no one can convince her  otherwise. Sometimes it doesn't matter. *Sometimes* she heads towards a mistake and 3 years later she finally comes around saying 'I never wanted that' and learning the lesson. She used to say she would never ever ever get married. She's discussed it with Erik already.
Bill: Stuff like that.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OOF REALLY
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s soon
N🆗ri (Marisa): the zenkaikon fan discord is crazy, an adam cosplayer is asking another person if they can make adam's mask and weapon for them in 2 days
Aldus Larian (Jess): some people only learn by experience
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): That’s fast to be talking about mawwiage
Aldus Larian (Jess): a year?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~it is?~~
Bill: The plus is significant and it's only talking but shrug.
Bill: I wouldn't know.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nancy and her husband got married in under 6 months
Bill: I'm still working on *girlfriend*.
Bill: But ye, Katy an experience learner.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I looked back on old convos with my ex a while back and the term "marriage" was thrown around about 3 weeks in. Should have seen that as a red flag
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OOF
N🆗ri (Marisa): nance and her husband super clicked, they say they're like those old-timey couples who get married in a matter of weeks and stay together for 80 years
Aldus Larian (Jess): my parents decided they were gonna get married 6 days in XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): and chose names for their kids too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): A psychic said I’m gonna get engaged at 24
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): HMMMMM
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Pretty sure we discussed marriage year one too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): a year is pretty soon tho, idk if that’s cause I’m 20 but damn
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I always felt like it was kind of soon too but that seems to be the trend these days
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But we decided we would wait for emotional reasons and we we're broke
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I got engaged after about 15 months
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~I dated hal a year and he got mad if I even made a joke about it~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like I don’t trust them hos, gotta know them at least 2 years
Aldus Larian (Jess): we discussed a year in and gave promise rind on our 1 year, we were 17
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeopers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): das cute
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess it’s different cause I assume grad school delays mawwiage age
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): DAS CAUSE YOU WERE MEANT TO BEEEE
Aldus Larian (Jess): guess im a ho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Got married when we were 23?
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wait is this year coming up.our 3 year anniversary?
Bill: People are married in grad school though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ye 3 years
Bill: Ye, I got you two gifts so far.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Had it been that long
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Shiiiiit
Aldus Larian (Jess): we got married in 16
Bill: ye, wedding still feels like it was just last fall or something.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ye seems like just yesterday
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Still working on that time machine so I can go back and see it
Bill: <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Interesting science
Bill: They forgot to include never.
Aldus Larian (Jess): we got engaged on our 5 year!
Bill: I mean. You both took promise ring as a serious commitment, so you kinda got engaged in a year.
Bill: You just didn't want to get married till you weren't broke.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mm tru
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Emotional vs financial engagement
Bill: The emotion is what matters.
Aldus Larian (Jess): alot of people thought we were just straight up married cuz tom had a ring too XD
Bill: I forgot I dug at Hunter for saying 'photography is important to him' like it's not for me...
Bill: Stupid depressed mood yesterday.
Bill: I dun't wanna fire back rn.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i use photography to pay for cons i can try
Bill: Nah, it's my issue with him.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There there billiam we all unnecessarily dislike someone
Bill: But I strive to do better.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Holy crap so I’m working on a spreadsheet for my mom
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And there’s a file with all the family expenses and I was curious
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 126 dollars a month to the homeowners association??? And they’ve done nothing for us?????
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): What the fuCK
Aldus Larian (Jess): whooo!
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh yeah the association i work for charges $110 a month
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea HOA fees can be killers
N🆗ri (Marisa): they're supposed to be in charge of snow removal/fixing potholes/quelling gang wars and prostitution rings.
Aldus Larian (Jess): mines only like 50  year D:
Aldus Larian (Jess): but its not exactly an HOA
N🆗ri (Marisa): h no a
Aldus Larian (Jess): its just the lake community thingy
N🆗ri (Marisa): can u swim in the lake
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *pay this fee for living here on top of your other property taxes for also living here*
Aldus Larian (Jess): nah thats costs like 150 extra
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wtf HOA has done nothing for us
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The city does snow plowing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 34 minutes left...

Bill: WOOW
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik):

Bill: Do I need an hour for that? No.
Bill: Would I rather stand on the train platform than be at my desk?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ferry ride sounds really pleasant right now
Bill: It does.
Bill: I’ll Instagram live it for you.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): bless

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Not to be TMI but my period decided to start today ..... right before out BEEDOIR....tomorrow....... I'm so annoyed at the female body
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg ok that’s actually super relieving to hear because mine is late and my biggest fear was having it start right as I was changing into beedoir
N🆗ri (Marisa): So we might both be bleeding to death 👌
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): BLEED ALL OVER EVERYTHING WITH ME!!!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): BLEEDOIR
