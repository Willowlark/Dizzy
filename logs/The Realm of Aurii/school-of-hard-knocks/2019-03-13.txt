Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Did you just get one a few minutes ago?
Bill: ye.
Bill: 'how r u feeling'
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Because so did I. Based on the similar timing, I'd say probably a bot
Bill: Yeah it a bot.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but *are you sure*
Bill: I believed you at first, I get no engagement on things so getting on tellonym would be weird.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Is there any thing that is really important to you in a relationship?*
Aldus Larian (Jess): someone to support my cheese addiction
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh no, Hal's about to start talking about finding love...

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he's been typing for like 5 minutes
Bill: Oh fuck he is.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh bboii
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like after 12+ hours after a conversation has ended, there isn't much point contributing to it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ohhhhhh no

N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooo annamarie is doing that now. she deleted everything and only posts in 3s now
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, it makes your profile look neat, but it's *annoying*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or when people split a photo into 3 separate images so they post a row and it forms the full image
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea it looks nice but...
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH that's strange
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but when you're scrolling through your feed you get a post that's like half a tit and part of their body

Aldus Larian (Jess): So my sister in law is pregnant and she's a high risk pregnancy becuase she gets blood clots so she has to take like 2 shots of some medication to the stomach everyday. And they've already had like multiple trips to the hospital. Right now she can't eat anything without throwing it up and is having trouble breathing. At first they thought it was a blood clot, and then they thought maybe her gallbladder but it's not so now they are running more tests for blood clots and also calling in 2 specialists. They've been in the hospital for 2 days now and was there over the weekend for like all of Saturday. And I'm just worried af....
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh no :(
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea 😔
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm so sorry. I hope things get better ❤
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm worried about something happening to her or the baby.  Or like God forbid my brother only ends up with one of them in the end and know that would ruin him.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thanks
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll keep them in my prayers
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thanks Erik ♥️
N🆗ri (Marisa): yikes. how far along is she?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Umm she's due end of May
N🆗ri (Marisa): best wishes
Bill: At least it's almost over. Hope things get better, she and your brother were really nice at the wedding.
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's good that the hospital is bringing in specialists and not just sending her home with medication
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea that's what the did Iver the weekend
Aldus Larian (Jess): But it didn't help so she's back. She doesn't take shit either so she probably insisted
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's they not do that again I mean
N🆗ri (Marisa): good ol' american healthcare system
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeeee. Thank guys I just needed to talk about it cuz I don't want to like ignore it? Idk if that makes sense
N🆗ri (Marisa): talk anytime!
Bill: Ye. Easier to not dwell on something when you talk about it.
