N🆗ri (Marisa): omg is everyone together because tonight's that ethan party?
N🆗ri (Marisa): or was that next month
whenever it is i hope there's a lot of tea
N🆗ri (Marisa): peaceful tea that doesn't harm you guys but is really dramatic to hear about
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, 5 minutes into the party he trips and breaks his foot and leaves the party but you guys still get to chill
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): No that's not yet, thats in april
Bill: Nah it’s the local squad.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O Rebecca deleted her lewd account cause she said her self image isn’t high enough
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Poor rebecca I should hang with her more
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): She’s a kind person and a good person to talk to
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Weird mentality but I think being better friends with rebecca could be good for both of us
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I always appreciate a friend to talk to and I think she made need someone to encourage her to take action
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause she was really psyched about a lewd shoot before, she showed me all the lingerie she bought
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think it might've discouraged her when she kept posting about wanting to do one in bne and no one responded or acknowledged it 😿
Bill: SHe needs to find that particular brand of self esteem herself.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): O well yeah but i get the impression she doesn’t have anyone to be like YEAH DO IT
Bill: Boudoir is about you, if you are uncomfortable with yourself it's hard to enjoy it.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Some people need that little tap on the butt to start running
N🆗ri (Marisa): rebecca cheer squad lets go
Bill: You already do that.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i want to kick all my friends in the butt to help them achieve her dreams_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye I mean I talk to her maybe once a week, even if they’re short convos
N🆗ri (Marisa): but our dreams suck and you gotta focus on becoming president of the moon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Idk, makes me sad when good kind people are suffering, makes me wonder if they just need a little encouragement
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I will kick all your butts so someday you’ll all simultaneously kick my butt so I will get launched to the moon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): #logic
N🆗ri (Marisa): that is a genius idea omg see this is why you're the president
holy guacamole
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like I’ve probably said before, how people treated me after the break up with hal has really stuck with me, and Rebecca really surprised me by stepping up to the plate and making herself available if I needed to talk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I take care of my own <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This about to get gay but I only ever hope that I can be helpful to my friends because I want to be able to show the kindness and support that they’ve shown me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So when Rebecca’s bein sad I just wanna be like TAKE MY CONFIDENCE I DONT NEED ALL OF IT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hey guys it’s 1:40 welcome to my gay ted talk
Bill: It's understandable. I say the same thing, I take care of my own.
Bill: Aurii is my own.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like I consider anyone who’s done something for me my own, with my social circles creating a hierarchy lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And Aurii is like the top of the hill
Bill: Someone being loyal and there for you is priceless and wanting to help them through everything is returning the favor
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH like Rich helped me so much by smuggling me into the RWBY shoot so I’ll bust ass to help him out next opportunity I get
Bill: imo you spread your circles a little too wide, but you're a more social person than I am.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pew:543202259085950996>
Bill: Harder to maintain that many connections.
Bill: I'd get stressed trying to please everyone.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Truuuu
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess I don’t see it as pleasing so much as I have a lot of feels and I want to help to convey my feels
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And even if someone forget that they’ve helped me, I won’t forget it, so
Bill: It's a Leo/Type A trait.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lol YEAH DEFINITELY
Bill: Or Chris Trager.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): <:pew:543202259085950996> Ann Perkins <:pew:543202259085950996>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _tell me you read it in his voice_
Bill: I help so much that I get a con dad rep because thats how I express my affection. If I have power to keep someone from suffering even a minor hardship, why shouldn't I give that advice or do that action?
Bill: It's not that they can't do it themselves. It's that I want them to be happy so helping is a need.
N🆗ri (Marisa): can confirm biru is major help
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Double confirm
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe even commander help
Bill: lol
Bill: Major General Help.
N🆗ri (Marisa): the dab doubles as a salute because no salute emoji
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dab is acceptable salute
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hmmm ya know I think I worry that I’m annoying and unlovable and generally a shitty version of Georgia when I’m a sad weenie
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So when people support me through what I perceive to be my lowest point, that’s when we become RIDE OR DIE
Bill: I hope you're riding a bus or something.
Bill: A horse would die under all the people.
N🆗ri (Marisa): big horse
N🆗ri (Marisa): strong
Bill: You may feel that way, but that vulnerability is part of who you are. People who really care about you don't consider that weak, they consider seeing that side of you (which everyone has) as a sign of how comfortable you are with them, how much you trust them with your weak moments.
Bill: Not wrong to consider it your weak point, but just to give you the perspective.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye that’s true
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I guess that’s why it stings when I’m that vulnerable and people kinda shirk me
Bill: I like those sides of people. I like to be there in the raw moments.
Bill: yes, trusting someone with your hurts/emotions and having them ignored is rough.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I like when people feel comfortable enough to show that side too
N🆗ri (Marisa): people tend not to show their vulnerability when they need to set an example for others. in front of children or those who are more vulnerable. or when theyre trying to keep up a front.
idk where i was going with this
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _sociology_
N🆗ri (Marisa): vulernability is ok in si YEAH THAT
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I feel like I need to be strong as much as I can because that’s when I’m “best”
Bill: Yeah, vulnerability is a hard thing to get into. At least for anyone with a pride streak like mine. I'm a perfectionist and rarely make mistakes due to excessive problem solving and planning. I hate to lose and I hate to be behind. Eventually I managed to circumvent the need to be vulnerable.
Bill: At least until *romance* got involved.
Bill: I don't regret learning the skill.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Dokis are unpredictable and do not obey the laws of logic
Bill: It's easier to process an issue when you feel it's acknowledge by people.
Bill: But by that I mean I know where you were going with that Marisa.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye that’s tru I feel like if you can learn to get past your own bullshit and feel vulnerable sometimes, it improves your quality of relationships
N🆗ri (Marisa): i was chatting with an older japanese lady who was telling me about that. women in japan have to be the pillar and cannot waver in front of their family or friends, she had a very interesting outlook on it. though media is the opposite and has begun to teach people that feelings are ok.
Bill: Relationships need boundries. 'this hurts me, I'm not okay with this, this is okay'. Some boundries can be inferred, others you have to open up and share to define.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And being open about those types of things make stronger bonds!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Otherwise you could end up in an infinite passive aggressive back and forth accidentally
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Or a collapse in friendship cause two peeps don’t convey their expectations
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The nature of relationships with people are wild
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I talked to my mom about that today, how people you aren’t even blood related to can be so close to your heart
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s comforting in a way
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OK FRIENDS THANKS FOR DA FEELS I’m a sleepy so I’ll see y’all in the morning
N🆗ri (Marisa): night 🌃
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's sad that rebecca deleted her spicy account, encouragement is a HUGE deal when you are doing something you are not sure about. I vaugley remember her talking about it but I think it was a deep seasonal depression day and I was justing being overall queit.
Bill: My parents bought a caaaaarrrrrrrrr
Bill: Or rather Dad did.
Bill: Fully featured rogue 2019. Mom can go back to driving the white rogue.
Bill: Until she decides on SOMETHING.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Hurrah!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): As awesome a photo that second one Hunter posted is, I'm not digging the out-of-focus branch directly in front if the lens. Just my personal opinion. But everything else about the photo is pretty damn good
Bill: It's a framing element. Maybe a little too out of focus, but his composition idea is solid.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I get it. But I agree a bit *too* out of focus
N🆗ri (Marisa): I think it’s pretty neat but ye too big/noticeable. Would be better a little smaller perhaps.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Last picture is very attack on Titan
Bill: Two of them, the lockpick and shiskabob, look like Georgia has a bobble head.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Nice
