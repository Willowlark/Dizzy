Bill: Meina wants to have a one on one to know about my projects... >.>
Bill: This either goes one way, where she actually wants to know what the fuck I do. Or she going to try and be 'my senior' and this is the woman who literally just asked 'how do I know if headphones have microphones in them'.
Bill: ,... she do an annoy.
Bill: She’s definitely not sure if she’s supposed to manage me. She’s not.
Aldus Larian (Jess): welp time to talk to the boss
Bill: I mentioned “we had a one on one” with Gord in a one on one with him, just describing the conversation for different reason and he was like “she what” and I was like shrug and he was like “oh I’ll have to let her know that’s not her thing” and I’m like “I mean yes but the thing I was talking about”.
Bill: Perfectly casual and unintentional.
Bill: Anna is so helpful and that's so sweet. Tears to my eyes, every time.
