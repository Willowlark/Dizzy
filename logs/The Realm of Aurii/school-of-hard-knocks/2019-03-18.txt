Bill: ~~I don't think it was intentional~~
Bill: I'm about to pull an Erik...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ?
Bill: I'm. A button press from killing all my loans.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Do it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If you have enough in your savings to live comfortably for a while after, definitely do it
Bill: That was a 20 thousand dollar button press.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *oof*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But good job
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoo congrats
N🆗ri (Marisa): 🎉 🎉
Bill: huu fucking zaah
Bill: I'm somehow expecting them to not take my money or something but.
Bill: I just have to wait for the payment to process.
Bill: Then it'll probably hit me.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Y’all are mind boggling
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): When impulsive spenders are also impulsive bill payers
N🆗ri (Marisa): Just like. How do you have that much savings?? That’s like an entire years worth of pay. Bada bing bada boom
Aldus Larian (Jess): When you work full time and live resnt free or with low rent it's not too hard. But it depends on your sistuation
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ooooo tru with rent
N🆗ri (Marisa): Our savings is $20 on the shelf in the bathroom pls no steal
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah I'm lucky that my "rent" is basically coming dinner one night a week and helping with shoveling and raking as required
Bill: Ye working full time has changed my definition of money.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~Also helps being in a career field that has statistically higher salary~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): 8.50 an hour <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So like, I feel like I cheated when paying off my loans so quickly
N🆗ri (Marisa): But u earned it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But other people have it worse and I feel bad 😞
N🆗ri (Marisa): Get richer and open a company and hire us 🙏
Bill: My parents said if I'm saving I don't have to pay rent. I help out a bunch around the house and such though.
Aldus Larian (Jess): When I lived at home I ahd to pay half the mortgage or we would of lost the house <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): All of my money goes to paying the bills. For some reason we have two sewer bills and the neighbors used to siphon off our cable.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We own the house so no rent luckily
Bill: Woo owning property!
N🆗ri (Marisa): We desperately want out of this neighborhood <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Yeah I understand that feeling Erik.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like when I posted on Facebook, some of my college classmates were like "HOW??? I'M STILL IN SO MUCH DEBT"
Bill: Yeah. I had a lot of good things happen at once to make this work...
N🆗ri (Marisa): BoJo is trying to get me to go for a PhD just so they defer my debt payments more and that’s a horrible idea
Bill: My car repurchase netted me extra cash in the switch from buying to lease.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I had good scholarships so my loans were low to begin with, my poppop and my dad split the difference for the remainder of my tuition, I don't pay rent, and I have a relatively well paying job for an entry level engineer, so like, I'm well aware of my privilege and I feel bad for it
N🆗ri (Marisa): my debt is really high even though I also had some really good scholarships and I couldn’t figure out how but now I realize BoJo took out extra student loans to pay for bills and food and I want to be mad at that but she was also going through hard times and there’s nothing I can do to change her taking those loans out now 

But don’t feel bad about what you have if you’re working hard for it and doing good things
N🆗ri (Marisa): If Rowan didn’t give me such awesome scholarships I wouldn’t be here because I would’ve gone to college elsewhere <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did.,,, did BoJo buy our house with my loan money <:thinku:543194478614413318>
Aldus Larian (Jess): My parents couldn't help with school at all. My parents almost lost our house multiple times and will now be paying for their house up until they die, I'm horrified of owing money to anyone. Loans scare the shit out of me so I never went any further than community college. Tom pretty much has the same feeling toward loans. We paid off my car 4 years ahead of time, didn't take out loans for our wedding and paid for his car straight out. I went to community and on shorlarship and finaincial aid, Tom took out loans but paid then off wheb we for my car cua we didn't want two loans
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's always a trip thinking how different your life would be had you made alternate decisions in your life
N🆗ri (Marisa): ||~~how am i $40,000 in debt if my entire freshman year at rowan was free~~||
Aldus Larian (Jess): My best friend parent shave stolen iver $25,000 for similar reasons as you Marisa, she is also 40,000 in debt from a college that isn't even accredited because she got scammed
N🆗ri (Marisa): not even accredited????????
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Holy shit what the fuck
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or like business don't recogniz it as a true degree? Something like that?
Bill: how do you do that to someone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's University of Phoenix
Aldus Larian (Jess): Basically everywhere she tired to apply told her her degree was useless and it was a "real college"
N🆗ri (Marisa): o o f
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's horrible
N🆗ri (Marisa): and really messed up?
Bill: I meant the parents.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Her parents too $20,000 from eat of their 3 kids inheritance (from this grandma) for a down payment on a house ethey ended up getting forclosed on
N🆗ri (Marisa): if she was in a similar situation to me then it couldn't be helped. yeah, for a house that makes sense.
we were homeless in my senior year of high school and i kind of needed an address to attend college
Aldus Larian (Jess): The other 5,000 was taken as an extra student load to pay bills
Bill: Are you looking for a job with your masters Marisa?
Bill: Social work maybe?
Bill: You wanted to teach too right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am job searching but since bojo has my car it's difficult. the dollar store in walking distance caught fire and took down their job listing. JET would be neat but i have no one to write references for me anymore, teaching english would be cool and it can be done online but i have nowhere to set up my computer for lessons. might open a class in this neighborhood because there's a lot of non-english speakers. i think for social work i'd just mess people's lives up more.
Bill: You could definitely get a reference from Matsumura sensei.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but it's been so long and she's also written like 3 other letters for me
Aldus Larian (Jess): I give reference
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mawisa good teacher
Bill: She gave them to you cause she still support you silly.
N🆗ri (Marisa): im trying to reset my rowan e-mail password because it expired and it says the password i used 5 years ago was used too recently <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: lol mood
N🆗ri (Marisa): getting a job in japan was super easy, and i was pretty much instantly hired at rowan so idk how to job
Bill: Linkedin, indeed, monster...
Bill: But it hard right now. 😭
Bill: There's a career advisement office at Rowan, contact them. They'll help alumni.
Bill: Probably one at temple too.
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg does this rowan email have unlimited storage
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol temple. helping. lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes the international center at rowan is hiring and I'm like 👀
Aldus Larian (Jess): Apply!
Bill: Cannot ever hurt to apply.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I 🐝  🍂 in 🇺
N🆗ri (Marisa): they don't have any iopenings now <:rip:369476083248267274>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Next time!
Bill: Send a resume anyway.
Bill: Actually, I think Kailyn from japanese class works there now.
Bill: Slide into her DMs.
Bill: See if she'll help out a fellow classmate.
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if she doesn't remERASTDYJF BUG THERS A SPDEIR
N🆗ri (Marisa): I DONT KNOW WHERE IT SWRTN
N🆗ri (Marisa): i am Scared
N🆗ri (Marisa): remember how i almost applied to that maid cafe. are there any similar jobs here.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Hmm not really I didn't t think
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's called being a waitress
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But you don't get to wear cute maid outfits
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea like a waitress would be the closest thing
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So not worth it
N🆗ri (Marisa): if i can't wear a maid outfit and draw on people's omelettes and make them say stupid things then what's the point
N🆗ri (Marisa): o i could do data entry that's what i do now
N🆗ri (Marisa): i could get another degree in library studies and be a librarian
N🆗ri (Marisa): if barnes and noble isn't hiring
N🆗ri (Marisa): what if i open a doll hospital
N🆗ri (Marisa): dhospital
N🆗ri (Marisa): i love this band
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lve3sAG05ko
N🆗ri (Marisa): jack might hire me. he's mentioned it in the past but also i think his store is struggling.
Bill: Just check for updates on the sites every day, looking for keywords.
N🆗ri (Marisa): o ye i've got it bookmarked <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: and you look for your job keywords every day?
N🆗ri (Marisa): i mostly just scroll through every new job posted in the area
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's not many
N🆗ri (Marisa): time to hit up craigslist
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh darn they're actual jobs. i wanted to see stuff like the tokyo craigslist where it's all ads for pornstars and shady nightclubs.
Bill: Actual jobs is better.
Bill: Make sure that masters degree is front and center. It’s a big selling point.
Bill: Look outside your area too, at least for job that you fill the skill set for. If they going to pay you well (Masters == pay jump) it may be worth the distance/figuring out how to get transport.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah with a master's, don't sell yourself short
N🆗ri (Marisa): it'd have to be super good though, good enough for bojo to reduce her hours so i can use the car or at least carpool
but i suck <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: You don’t.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ya
Bill: You don’t.
Bill: It’s hard to self evaluate. Look at Glassdoor and see what salaries are for the jobs in your field. Don’t sell shorter than that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes i sit on my leg knowing that it'll make my leg fall asleep and then i'm shocked and appalled when my leg falls asleep anyway
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a lot of decent looking at-home efl teaching positions but i have nowhere at home to teach from and sometimes the internet goes out for a minute
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hear furry artists make bank <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: So take time to clear a spot so you can get the job. Bojo has to help you with that much.
N🆗ri (Marisa): she threw out two boxes today!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): v proud
Bill: Good!
Bill: Make that the short term goal. Money a great motivator.
N🆗ri (Marisa): we got four new sewing students so that's $20 a student for 2 hours but we share the income
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe i ask mrs rohrer if she knows any positions. she owns rowan.
Bill: Yes. It’s ALL about connections.
Bill: Also you can differ loan pay back when you don’t have a full time job. My sister did that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): orly? we've tried doing that because we didn't have enough income and they were like 'lol too bad give us $300 a month'
N🆗ri (Marisa): we have a lot of connections i just hate using them because it feels like i'm bothering people and asking for unfair things
Bill: You are not. If they don’t want to help you they won’t, if you don’t ask you’ll never know that there ready and willing to.
Bill: ASK.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but then they're like 'this talentless ungrateful punk wants everything handed to her on a silver platter wow how spoiled'
Bill: Our neighbor got katy her job. It’s ALL about who you know. I asked a friend of my parents in PA to keep an eye out at her company for Andrew. It is ALL about connections.
Bill: No, you’re a respectful go getter whose pounding the pavement looking for work.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll become a youtuber and make videos like this it's genius
https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9c024ee3911b785dbd95b0099e617dd/tumblr_pj4mfakCnP1qjhe46o4_400.gif
Bill: The spoiled punk is the one who sits around expecting a job to fall in their lap.
N🆗ri (Marisa): a teenager walked into our office the other day to ask when the pool was opening for the summer and bojo was like "hey kid do you want a job" and he was like "yeah" and she was like "ok come back on monday"
N🆗ri (Marisa): i should interview everywhere now that my bangs don't block my vision
N🆗ri (Marisa): when we throwin a party for biru and erik
N🆗ri (Marisa): with helium balloons and carbonated water
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg has anyone ever considered a carbonated water balloon fight
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru and erik do you prefer helium, air, water, or sparkling in your balloons
Aldus Larian (Jess): I took down Christmas lights today finally
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's like the only thing I accomplished...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Well ok not actually cuz I also cleaned like half the house but yea
Bill: Thank for the inspiration too Erik. If you didn't pay off yours, I wouldn't have thought to make this move.
N🆗ri (Marisa): jess bring those to the party
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You're welcome! Congrats and props for making an even bigger payment
N🆗ri (Marisa): we'll just get a mix of everything in the balloons
Bill: I'm sure you had to to just as much, you just did it over time.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): True
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wonder if adding "debt free" to my Bumble profile would get me more matches 🤔
Bill: what's a match.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Probably, Ngl.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I'll add that to my "two truths and a lie"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Debt free is sexy ye
Bill: Like looks aren’t what matters.
Bill: ...On bumble.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *> Walks into work "Yeah I'm gonna be so productive today and get the things on my small to-do list done"
> one hour later and all I've done is watch videos on YouTube of Viners reacting to their old Vines*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I think everyone’s going into work late
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): The morning commute is still shit right now
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Drunk bois
N🆗ri (Marisa): why would everyone be drunk
Aldus Larian (Jess): my work has 3 bosses (my boss and his 2 sons) so i asked my coworker who he had a meeting with and he says "The Big 3" and im like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): nepotism
N🆗ri (Marisa): a lady just walked in with one of our security signs from out front (the ones that say "this is protected by so-and-so security company") and she said "this fell over can I have it for my house"
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oooo ye people like to take those and put them outside their house so people think that have security cameras even tho they dont
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah. they gave it to her because she might steal it anyway. <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao yea probably
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the company my dad works for has a dealer in Ireland and they were talking last week and the dealer asked if they had off on Monday (today) and my dad was like, "Noooo?" and the dealer was like "Oh, doesn't everyone come in to work hungover?"
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg i hope he said yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ok, I was being productive and then finished something and then took like a 25 minute goof off break. Time to close out of my Discord tab and be productive again
Bill: ha lol closing.
Bill: I have a monitor dedicated to discord.
Bill: Which is actually good, cause otherwise I constantly switch back to chats.
Bill: This way I keep the work on the main monitor and goofing off on the other.
Bill: ~~I realized yesterday the longest period of time, asides from sleep, I'm off discord is a movie run time~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): ive been editing my acne moles and wig gaps out of pics for liek 30 mins cuz i can decide what to post today
N🆗ri (Marisa): this morning i typed 25 pages of info and organized two filing cabinets and they said they thought that would take me all week and into next week to do so i don't have anything else to do unless a customer comes in so i brought my notebook to do research >:3c
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh there it is. like, is discord acting up for anyone else
N🆗ri (Marisa): nothing is posting and then it does post
N🆗ri (Marisa): is aurii dying
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it happening in any other servers
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i think it's just you
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): mines working fine
Aldus Larian (Jess): mine seems ok
N🆗ri (Marisa): is it possible that big areas can have a lapse in coverage because this was happening at home last night too and i thought it was just our internet. cellphone calls have been disconnecting lots too
N🆗ri (Marisa): anyway did you guys know that in the 1940s there was a top secret screening of a Fantasia VHS tape in Japan that only super high ranking military officials could view because they were studying their enemy (america) by watching the tapes they had confiscated from a war ship and they didn't know fantasia was a huge flop in the US that cost over 2 million dollars so they started crying and got real nervous
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mine is having hiccups
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Discord why
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): they were like "this is beautiful and a masterpiece, how can the US make such a thing while we're pinching pennies to feed our troops"
also the US had a ship during wwii whose only purpose was to make and transport ice cream around the to troops. that was also super demoralizing to japan.
N🆗ri (Marisa): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream_barge
N🆗ri (Marisa): can u imagine. coming back from the war.
"what division were you in?"
"ah. i was the ocean ice cream man."
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Damn your troops get ice cream and all our troops children get are fruit drops
Bill: late, I think I'm out of non cosplay to post for my pattern of non cosplay/cosplay.
Bill: And... I don't have a lot of motivation to do non portrait photos these days?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I don't think I'm ever gonna watch that again
Elfriede Faun (Tom): No sir
Bill: Spring might help with that.
Bill: But do I give up on the pattern thing and just post more?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Fire butterflies
N🆗ri (Marisa): post every day
N🆗ri (Marisa): no firefly or fly emoji <:rip:369476083248267274>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): 💸
Aldus Larian (Jess): my mind is big fuzz in relation to work today i cant remeber what happened on friday cuz i was v. distracted
N🆗ri (Marisa): understandable
retrace all your steps
Bill: but my pattern.
Aldus Larian (Jess): well i rarely leave me desk so
N🆗ri (Marisa): a good start
Bill: ~~I say, like anyone goes to my account page to see all of the posts~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): most people  have your instagram page as their homepage
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've been called leia three times today why does this always happen
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's the hair
N🆗ri (Marisa): which is better the white out tape or the white out liquid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've noticed that a lot of my lack of productivity at work stems from FOMO on conversations on Discord so I always have a tab for it open and then I just wind up goofing off so I forced myself to close it and not open a new one up while also having my phone on Do Not Disturb mode
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): needless to say, today is actually pretty productive so far
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I used that forest app thing for 75 consecutive minutes
N🆗ri (Marisa): what that :0
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.forestapp.cc/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you plant virtual trees and set a timer for how long you want to be productive for
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and the app forces you to not open any other apps, otherwise your tree will die
N🆗ri (Marisa): o that's cool how the virtual currency buys real trees
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~every time you use the internet someone chops down a tree irl~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): This is my 2019 forest so far
N🆗ri (Marisa): nice shrubs
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Those were like, 20 minute sets. The plant gets bigger the longer you go
Bill: Lol I’m not that motivated to work.
Bill: Also I can goof off in way too many ways.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how do the people in this office live. someone was talking to a customer and in the middle of their sentence they put food in their mouth. like,
"so what we can do about your problem is" puts entire peanut butter cup in mouth. chews it in silent for like 40 seconds. "this here..."
Aldus Larian (Jess): ugh sis in laws pain is now worse than ever apparently so surgery is back on table for today for her galbladder
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh no. I hope everything goes well and it helps her
Aldus Larian (Jess): her mom still hasn't been to see her. my moms having a melt down and want to go see her but my mom wont drive outside of he comfort zone so shes like all upset she cant go
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): literally what the fuck is wrong with her mother
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): how far is she from her daughter?
Aldus Larian (Jess): prob like 2 hours?
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh wait no hr and 14 mins
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): how can someone just not care about their own child like that? I don't understand -_-
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea i dont know either, shell drive halfway across the county to buy livestock but wont go see her daughter
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like your *daughter* is suffering and having life-threatening complications to both her and your *grandchild*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YUP and its been almost a full week
Aldus Larian (Jess): well technically its been over a week
Bill: Family is whose there for you, who cares about you.
Bill: Your Mom is fantastic Jess. 🙏
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): my parents are very similar when it comes to that. they put themselves before anyone else. very selfish. 
But, i gotta say, it's fantastic and uplifting to see that your parents have been there for her. So, she doesnt feel as alone. 
I really hope everything works out for her, whether it be surgery or anything else they end up doing, she's been suffering through a lot. I feel so bad for her.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea its really sad to see 😦 but thank you! i hope they can get her in surgery soon so she can get on her way to actually getting better
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): has she been able to eat anything?
Aldus Larian (Jess): she was feeling alot better Saturday and ate normal food and everything, yesterday she was fine, eating normal and then overnight she woke up even worse than before
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): oh, wow, i mean its good she at least got a few real meals in though. but, wow. thats so awful.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i wonder if her diet has anything to do with it? if they were checking her gallbladder and such. food can contribute a lot to hypotension
Aldus Larian (Jess): probably, im not sure exactly what she was eatting over the weekend, but still her pain was bad even after not eating at all for several days
Bill: Nevermind, converse bugging feets.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they gave me a ton of work to do 15 minutes before i was supposed to leave and when i said i couldn't finish it in time they said to just clock out and do it at home <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why can't you just do it tomorrow
Aldus Larian (Jess): Or whatever day you go to work again
N🆗ri (Marisa): because they need it by tomorrow morning <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTF
N🆗ri (Marisa): they need me to write up the entire budget for 2018, make an excel sheet for all the money they received and all the money they spent <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ......you cant clock out to do work
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~there's no money in their budget to pay me any more lol~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:5142_then_perish:554720548274569246>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Why didn't they give u it when you we're doing nothing
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH EXACTLY RIGHT?
Aldus Larian (Jess): my boss hasnt approved me zenkai time yet
N🆗ri (Marisa): have you tried physical violence
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao no
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm honestly not sure if mine got approved lol
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I put it on my boss's desk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And then he made a comment about the vacation I have planned for July so I'm not sure if he saw that from the request sheet I submitted or because I put it on the office calendar
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): /shrug
Aldus Larian (Jess): my boss lost my time off request but he said he signed it XD
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just saw Hunter's PSA on his story
Bill: I don’t think it matters that much.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I'm always afraid of tagging photogs because I don't want to flood their tagged photos with my posts~~
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: Who really uses that section of Instagram anyway.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Exactly
Bill: He must like it for his workflow and thinks everyone should do it.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'll just make a mental note to do it for Hunter's photos
Bill: It’s nice, but afaik the only difference is I get two notifications instead of just the mention.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I always tag in the caption idk why
Bill: It’s the norm.
Bill: Oof he shared it to the Katsu photographer group.
Bill: Dude.
Bill: Wait does he want to use his Instagram tagged photos as a portfolio.
Bill: That’s. Dumb. Hunter no.
Bill: 
Bill: ~~I don't want help~~
Bill: Oh no Hunter. Instagram shits on photo quality.
Aldus Larian (Jess): He dmed you?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Oo NVM I haven't been to one yet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I also don't want to tag them in the photo because I add filters...~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~I guess maybe I should stop~~
