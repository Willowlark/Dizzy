Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *> sees Ethan post a guitar video
> sounds like garbage because over distortion
> sees he tagged @roosterteeth for a Bullet For My Valentine cover*
Wat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): holy mother of distortion
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Tags roosterteeth???
Aldus Larian (Jess): That's such a stretch
Aldus Larian (Jess): It's cuz he's wearing their shirt I guess?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oooo yeaaah
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh maybe lol
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, it screams *"Notice me, Rooster Teeth Senpai!"*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also the amount of times he's had me try to guess what song he was playing... üôÑ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): mooD
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeaaaa
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): if youre gonna be a guitar douche then dont make it obvious  youre tryin hard
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Either it's a song I don't know because I don't listen to the kind of music he does, I can't recognize it without the rest of the music behind it, or he's playing it wrong
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He does that to me.. specifically because I NEVER know
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And then makes a joke about it as if it's my fault for not knowing and not his for playing shittiy
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I'm bad at that stuff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ethan: "Guess what song that was"
Me: "Uhhhh.... I dunno"
Ethan: "Simple Man by Skynyrd!"
Me: (internally) *No it wasn't...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Aldus Larian (Jess): Lmao omgggg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, that specific time, I was like, you're playing this horribly wrong because *I* know how to play it and that was not remotely close
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Erik. Can I just say. When we were at ethans a few times and he would get out his guitar and try to impress us 


And then.... you would take over and absolutely decinate him
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): That was the most fucking hilarious thing
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): In the entire world
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yes
Aldus Larian (Jess): That
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And it took all of my energy not to crack up
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like that one time me and Tom came, you started and me and Tom looked at each other like üëÄüëÄ
Aldus Larian (Jess): And then on the way home we were like "Erik is so much better"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAOOO  YEA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): üòÇ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OMG IM SO SAD I MISSED THIS
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ethan: "I *refuse* to learn how to play Stairway to Heaven"
Me: *~Immediately starts playing it~*
Aldus Larian (Jess): YAAAS
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMFAOOOOOOOO YESS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wow erik you dont even have a guitar highlight on insta
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): you aint even tryna brag
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): That's because I post full cover videos on IGTV that no one watches lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): cause igtv is weird
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): OTHERWISE YOUD BE GETTIN ALL DA VIEWS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): seriously people send me nice things and im like thanks those 5 notes took 30 minutes
Bill: Igtv is the dumbest thing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I never watch videos cuz I'm a terrible person
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Lol thanks for the like Leanna
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): üòé üëâ üëâ
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): omg megs story says "love him" with a pic of her dog and i just spat thinking "well now i know who hal wishes he could be"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I gotchu fam
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAOOOOOOFFF
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): erik i cant watch you play or i feel like a scrun
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): too good plz nerd
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think Erik has a bit more practice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): that is 100% true i have only 3 months of intermittent practice
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so obviously im not discouraged cause im still a newb BUT DAMN i wanna be cool like erik
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mood
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've been playing for like 13ish years but believe me, I vaguely remember when I was in your shoes, trying to learn riffs to my favorite songs!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And for 3 months you're doing pretty heckin good!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): THANK
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah i look at when i first tried the scale like "damn u were slow gurl" so i definitely feel the improvement
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): plus peeps like you and noah have given me a couple ProStrats
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~guitar pun ahaaaaa~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~props to you for learning scales though because I skipped that and I regret it but I'm too impatient to learn now~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye i was in the school band in middle/high school so i figured scales were the best place to start
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it took a while to get used to reading tabs too cause i was used to sheet music
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I like tabs so much better because it literally tells you which fret on which string lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): it makes soooo much more sense once you adjust yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and everything on the internet is in tabs too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats how i found red like roses
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): snow bein all "heres a pic of me and the lovely morningmist" like ok plz i know you just became friends but that post makes it seem so fake
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I hope it's not though. I was getting tired of that drama and was happy to learn they're on better terms now
Bill: *Oh no honey that be exactly why*
Bill: yo more fuck you to this little group of Hunter's. Admin is like an Angry Karen about stiffed photos.
Bill: 
Bill: 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeeeeaaaaahhhh
Bill: I return photos *in excess* and will not be a part of a group that's so judgemental, cause tbh I don't feel this 'protecting photographers' thing and only a lot of KAREN.
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~damn it mom~~
Bill: lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It‚Äôs kinda nice, and I lowkey get it, because I‚Äôve shot with a lot of photographers at events that I never heard back from again
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Franco, who hugs me at every big con he sees me at, hasnt returned like any photo he‚Äôs taken of me lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But the time limit is lame
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It also discourages photographers from working with as many people as possible in a way?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Also just seems kind of weird to have everyone upload to the same share drive?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like if you're working one-on-one with someone, there's no need to dump it in a community folder
Bill: I would not want to shoot at any event under those stipulations. I don‚Äôt do model releases normally and the unfair expectation she‚Äôs putting on my isn‚Äôt worth the model release.
Bill: Agreed.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): There‚Äôs too much control and hand holding
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I was hoping to see like... a more involved and cheaper konkon
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And those stipulations probably discourage new photographers that aren‚Äôt sure they‚Äôd even return one GOOD photo
Bill: It‚Äôs based off a DC group with 1.8k people. Same format.
Bill: I guess people like it but.
Bill: If you want everyone to treat the shoot like pro models and photographers, just. Have them charge rates. That‚Äôs how you get pro photogs involved.
Bill: Konkon is supposed to have some kind of photographer thing too. It‚Äôs not a legalise form though, it‚Äôs buried in the group description somewhere.
Bill: Oof saw Hunters post in the group, he invited BNE to shmoosh admin.
Bill: Cause something about he was jealous of his VA friends and the og group?
NüÜóri (Marisa): Thanks for always putting up with me.
I know something is very wrong with me, and I'm always bothering or inconveniencing others because of my own insecurities. I know what's wrong with me, I just don't have the resources nor access to resources that can make me better. Everything I do feels like a pointless waste and I view myself as disposable garbage who is loathed by everyone, yet I'm desperate to be helpful in some way. People tell me that's not true and I just can't believe them, even with evidence to the contrary. I don't know how long it will take for me to stop thinking this way seeing as I have for years and it's begun causing physical pain. But I'll try and I'm sorry for this dumb post thanks for reading don't forget there have been double the amount of computers produced this year around the world than bicycles.
Bill: Correction. We don't "put up" with you. My day is better anytime you say something stupid about computers and bicycles, or meme with me about stuff, or just be you. I'd only be bothered by not having you around.
NüÜóri (Marisa): ok but i'm sure this bothers you
Bill: Did they manage to separate the yoke into one half and the rest of the goo to the other?
Bill: Neat.
NüÜóri (Marisa): She Put Exactly 14 Eggs In Ice Cube Tray And Left It In The Freezer For 2 Hours. When She Saw What Happened Next She Decided To Do The Same Thing Every Day! Amazing!
NüÜóri (Marisa): amazing
Aldus Larian (Jess): We dont put up with you, we love you! I know your mind wont let you believe that but I'm going to keep telling you anyway. You are extremely fun to be around and you are a very helpful person. I love having you as a friend and I miss you when we dont talk for a few days ‚ù§
Bill: Few DAYS?
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~few hours~~
Bill: I miss marisa when she isn‚Äôt rambling about something by NOON.
Bill: RIGHT?
Aldus Larian (Jess): omg i know right
NüÜóri (Marisa): noon is too early no one is awake at that time
Bill: Marisa is the only way I survive at work in the mornings.
NüÜóri (Marisa): ur lovely coworkers
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Mawisa we love you üíï I know I'm new to this inner circle and I don't know you personally all that well, but you always make me smile üòÄ
NüÜóri (Marisa): this is emoji erasure
Aldus Larian (Jess): literally
Bill: It‚Äôs ‚Äúnou‚Äù erasure.
Bill: No u is a cursed phrase.
NüÜóri (Marisa): if o**N**ly we still had that **O**ther emoji where all three letters were **U**nited in a single emoji
NüÜóri (Marisa): is anybody still at work i have quizzes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *~raises hand*~
Bill: She must have hundreds damn, that was like a whole 10 hours without active Mawisa.
NüÜóri (Marisa): yeah i started a list of stuff i found on tumblr like this
Bill: SNRK
Bill: I hate homebrew DND man.
Bill: No one actually keeps a power balance in place so you get a subclass that makes you god.
NüÜóri (Marisa): oh and I wanted to mention I won't do terra because i feel like i wheedled my way into the teen titans group and that's not fair to you guys
NüÜóri (Marisa): but i might bring dani for thursday of zenkai
Bill: -_-

NüÜóri (Marisa): im a pwofesshonaw
NüÜóri (Marisa): that's the exact number of words i know exactly
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Some of those harder ones I might have gotten by process of elimination or guessing so I'm not sure how accurate this actually is
NüÜóri (Marisa): 100% accurate
NüÜóri (Marisa): everything on the internet is true
Aldus Larian (Jess): u never impose u are much fun to cosplay with
Bill: ~~we waited a whole year for you to con with us, why would we ever *not* want you~~
Bill: ~~you have a YEAR to make up for~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): the same site has a bunch of cool language based quizzes you can pick and choose from like

Bill: Yes, V is mystic messenger.
