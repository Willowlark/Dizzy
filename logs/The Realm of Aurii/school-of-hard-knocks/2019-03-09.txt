N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: ❤️
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I was always scared to look in people's eyes, but more recently, like the last year I've kinda made a point to do it, cuz I wanna be a more friendly/feeling person
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I like to do it now👌
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's v personal
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): People used to really dig into me that I never looked people in the eyes when I was younger, so i eventually got used to doing it
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): It's too intimate tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If I look directly in people's eyes I sometimes get distracted and forget what I'm taking about
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ye it’s distracting ^
I operate under the principle of “if I don’t make eye contact they won’t notice me” and I become invisible
I can do it under certain circumstances like work but otherwise it feels so rude and weird to look at someone’s eyes
Bill: I don’t mind it... but I usually feel like it’ll creep people out of if I do.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _hes copying me again_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and even playing mY MAIN_
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah def not a good thing to do in all situations 🙏
Elfriede Faun (Tom): But with good friends it's different 👌
Bill: Ye. No problems looking in the eyes of my friends.
N🆗ri (Marisa): if I ever look y’all in the eyes outside of a staged cosplay photo I’ll spontaneously combust
N🆗ri (Marisa): and then reincarnate like a phoenix or the gods in noragami
Bill: Nope lies. I’ve definitely seen your eyes.
N🆗ri (Marisa): How’s that possible when I wear shutter shades 24/7
Bill: L I E S
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mmmm I’m havin a moody night why is everything annoying me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): How do I chill 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Often I find just sleeping will help me clear my mind if I'm in a funk. Kind of a lame suggestion, but that's all I really got :/
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): If you need to vent, feel free to DM me
Bill: Yeah.
Bill: To both.
Bill: Talking through things is the only way I’ve found I can truly get out of my head though.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im just frustrated
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i felt like i was really stepping out of my comfort zone with the make up tutorial and it kinda shat the bed
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and everyones like "oh its international womens day heres all the womens i love"
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~and megs been mentioned like a zillion times even tho she wouldnt even take care of an innebriated person~~
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and stupid sakura and chocowaffo just both hit 3000? i remember when i was at 2k and they were at 300
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and its like... yo ive totally plateau'd in growth
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): instagram shouldnt matter but it feels shitty that no one likes my fallout stuff and pyrrha is just old news now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ive also been busting my butt with physics for so long that having more free time now is actually giving me anxiety
Bill: Fallout was never popular, it only feels less so because you’re comparing it to other content. You don’t choose content for followers, you choose it for things you enjoy. You love your vault suit, popularity be damned. I’ve shot it enough times to know.
Bill: Sink your free time into a project. You want to do og Lux right? Think about it like that. Or spend time with people you care about. Invest in your friendships.
Bill: Also It sucks physics has to eat so much of your time.
Bill: ~~I’m sorry I’m the Chris trager of problems but I’m also drunk~~
Bill: Your worth as a person has NOTHING to do with Meg, hell, nothing about you does and you need to stop comparing yourself to her.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And don't think about chocowaffo or sakura. They're trying too hard to "make it big" as cosplayers. You have your mind set on an actually promising career in science. That's fucking amazing and way more impressive than number of followers or likes on your Instagram. Remember that this is a hobby; something you do for fun. Not your career
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): You have a much more promising future than literally any of them
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): And you have plenty of people who love you ❤
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeah you guys are right ❤
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): id rather be a genuine person with so-so popularity than a fake with a lot
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im gonna plan lux
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): thats a good idea
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and you just purged a fuck ton of spam followers. Imagine where Brittanie or Allegra would be if they got rid of their spam followers
Bill: Wasn’t I supposed to kick you if you ever let fame get to your head.
Bill: I promised that at some point.
Bill: I’ll let it slide.
Bill: This time.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i dont wanna be famous i just want to feel appreciated 😞
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): and everyone being all "XDDDD meg is so gr8" like no fuk u
Bill: Jeezus girl like we don’t love what you do enough?
Bill: Stop looking at stories of people that upset you.
Bill: It’s not healthy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _i get curious_ but youre right
Bill: Curiosity KILLED THE CAT.
Bill: Your mental health is more important than whatever bullshit is going on in Delaware. If it was important we’d tell you.
Bill: Give yourself the space you need to forgive and move on.
Bill: Focus on the people who do care about you and appreciate you. Not the people you think should.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): yeaaaah idk
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~i want to see them fail to know that im not the failure~~
Bill: You want them to hurt to make you feel better. It’s not healthy. Them hurting doesn’t actually make you feel better.
Bill: It’s a temporary high.
Bill: You are not the failure for fucks sale. Relationships don’t work out. ALOT. It happens.
Bill: I can’t phrase a continuation through the haze. Tag in someone.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Nooo it’s okay I’m gonna plan lux to distract
Bill: YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah seriously I'd go back to blocking thier stories
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's not healthy for you 💕
Elfriede Faun (Tom): (probably)
Bill: It’s not.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought it back~~ why does my computer screen keep changing colors is there a way to stop that

social media causes a lot of issues and discontent. you should use it for fun, not treat it like a part time job or feel responsible to give people content, or compete with others. that ruins creativity and just stirs up bad feeling all around. what people like on instagram is weird and makes no sense. the only posts i have that got over 100 notes are ones i didn't try at all for and just threw up there, they aren't even cosplay while the costumes i work the hardest on are my least popular.

if you try too hard you'll crash and burn but if you go at your own pace you can watch everyone else crashing and burning as you rubberneck in the next lane
Bill: MARISA 100% CORRECT
N🆗ri (Marisa): ~~im just salty and jaded to be a nobody after 11 years of cosplay i'm like the old lady who's given up and yells at kids on the lawn~~
Bill: Look for validation, appreciation, and love from the people that know and GIVE A SHIT about you as person, not as a “cute girl in a corset” like your followers. I’m generalizing but my point stands, we, BNE, your school friends care about YOU and those are the people you should care to impress, not a damn follower count.
Bill: Sakura and Choco-fucking-waffo are filling a void with Internet attention.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeeeet
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah most of your followers kind of equate you with pyrrha and think of you as the characters you cosplay which is a little creepy, they don't think of you as you
Bill: Followers are not friends. Stop tracking unfollows and follows. It’ll make you think they matter. I turned off like notifications. I’m much happier not worrying about if people liked one post versus another. If I post it’s cause I like the image. Not for my followers.
N🆗ri (Marisa): scott messaged me asking when his katsucon pictures would be done the other day as i was working on them and it sapped all my motivation to work on them ;~; i suck
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nah it's understandable,was he at least good about it?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's like your about to clean your room
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And your mom asks you to clean your room
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Now motivation is gone
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH exactly like that <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
Yeah I don’t know him very well but he just asked when they’d be done, then when I said today or tomorrow he said the contract was sealed so now I’m like *i gotta do it now but motivation is zero*
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve only gotten one of my paid shoots back so it hasn’t been too long right
Elfriede Faun (Tom): How many have you not gotten back
N🆗ri (Marisa): Three paid shoots out of four
Elfriede Faun (Tom): How does that happen
Elfriede Faun (Tom): We're they all the same person?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): What sketchy back alley photographers you hiring <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): No they’re from different people? I’ve shot with most of them before this isn’t anything unusual 
Right
4-6 weeks is typical turnaround
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Wait when were these shoots
N🆗ri (Marisa): One Friday evening, two Saturday
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ohh at katsuuu
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Okay that makes more sense
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee
N🆗ri (Marisa): When did you think it was? OwO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I thought you were just like stiffed 3 times out of the 4 total paid shoots that you ever did
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg no I have dozens of paid shoots
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’ve spent hundreds R.I.P.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I got stiffed on Saber and Pyrrha
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe that’s why my motivation is gone like “pls be patient on your free photos I know I promised them soon but I’m a monster with depression pls I’ll get them to you”
Aldus Larian (Jess): <@351785752197201920>  I'mma need you to summarize this for me
N🆗ri (Marisa): 1000 words or less and cite your sources
N🆗ri (Marisa): APA style
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I mean you can just tell him that too
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just be like,yo I'll try my best but I'll get you them pictures when I get them
Elfriede Faun (Tom): It's free like you said
N🆗ri (Marisa): but i don't want to disappoint him any further. i've finished georgia and jess's pictures. his should have been done first but i'm more comfortable editing pictures of people i know so it was easier to get them out of the way than delay all the shoots
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye he can wait
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You did him a solid
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'll do my best to get them to him tomorrow i made a blood oath
Bill: He can wait. You did the photos for your own enjoyment, and if he’s pressuring you for free photos he sure as hell isnt appreciate of your time/talents.
Bill: There is no unwritten expectations.
Bill: I do smaller shoots first usually cause it’s easier to finish them in a sitting, you do what your comfortable with not “work on whoever asks first”.
N🆗ri (Marisa): The neighbor towed our car for “revenge” but we didn’t do anything to her. She told the towing company our car was in her spot. It’s literally in our assigned parking space with our house number on it and the towing company didn’t bother to check her address before taking the car. Now she’s outside threatening to call the cops on us because she’s on drugs and not thinking straight. Thanks lady.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ah. BoJo says somebody on the hoa board towed her boyfriend last week because he was parked overnight without a parking pass and he’s a drug dealer. So I guess in revenge for that she had our car towed despite us being unrelated to that incident.
Bill: Wow fuck her.
Bill: She/the two company are paying for it right?
N🆗ri (Marisa): idk BoJo’s still yelling at people on the phone. I assume the towing company would pay because it’s their mistake? Our development has some kind of deal with them
N🆗ri (Marisa): Temporary parking passes are so easy to get it takes like 3 minutes
Bill: Yeah. Someone else should pay, that was an illegal tow.
N🆗ri (Marisa): we got the police comin' who're gonna talk to the towing company to get the car back
N🆗ri (Marisa): good news is we're getting the car back in a bit <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756> 
bad news is i made a plan and i really should not have done that.
N🆗ri (Marisa): not a full one but the start of one so i'm going to do something else now
Aldus Larian (Jess): Plan for what? 😮
N🆗ri (Marisa): death <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was an accident and has strict conditions i hope don't come true but i thought of it anyway and that sucks so i'm gonna make some tacos
Aldus Larian (Jess): Are you ok?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Also yes tacos good
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm gonna replace the lettuce with rice
Aldus Larian (Jess): Tasty
Bill: No plans. I make the plans. You eat taco, I make plans.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i'm not gonna eat the taco they're just neat to make duh
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe i eat the taco
but i have to stop eating this cake
Aldus Larian (Jess): Eat taco and cake
Aldus Larian (Jess): Mmm taco
N🆗ri (Marisa): *taco cake you're a genius*
Elfriede Faun (Tom): All
