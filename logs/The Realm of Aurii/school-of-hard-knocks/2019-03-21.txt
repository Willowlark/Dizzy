Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so I dunno what I did but I think there's a nerve somewhere in my left arm that's funky because my hand has been periodically tingly lately. Like I first noticed it last night
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh no!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like it doesn't seem to be anything serious because it's not full out numb or anything. just occasionally feels tingly. Maybe I've been sleeping on it weird or I'm just not getting good circulation. Idk. Just kind of annoying
