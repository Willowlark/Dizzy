Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i know that even if i get rejected from everything, ill probably snag a summer internship with the rutgers physics department
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): but its a bummer seeing all the other physics majors get stuff
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): maybe they're saving the best for last 😏
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tru
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): its kinda sad, im actually hoping to get rejected from the 9 other schools i applied to, just to get the NASA internship as the last
Bill: In my experience Phds are bad at things like paperwork.
Bill: You're already putting yourself out six ways to sunday to get to NASA, if NASA hasn't responded I'd say you wait for them, offer or no offer. Especially if Rutgers has an option for you.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): oh well nasa doesnt close apps til april 1st
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): so i wont hear from them til then
Bill: Never know, but.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): which is a bummer
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): YEAH true
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i could _stand out_ or something
Bill: NASA is your top choice. If you choose something else and find out you could have gone to NASA, you'll kick yourself.
Bill: Go for the first choice.
Bill: They could also do internship admission in waves...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *submit an Earth-chan cosplay to stand out*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): T R U
N🆗ri (Marisa): I don’t think Hal fully gets what a yandere is
Aldus Larian (Jess): 👀
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just noticed this channel got renamed
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I was very confused
Bill: I think calling it bn-tea is setting us up poorly... I dunno, Ive been feeling my toxicity level rising and wanted to make a shift.
Bill: Too much gossip.
Bill: For me. That’s not a knock to gossip, plenty needs to be had just.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I.... kind of feel the same
Bill: .... then Hal does something stupid.
Bill: Sigh.
Bill: Nothing to be said. Okay.
Bill: Moving on. Hard knocks is still discussing what ails us, but I dunno. Just. Not kicking bne all day.
Bill: Also this isn’t weird, I change channel names every once and awhile (I never reorder them, so position will be the same) it’s just fittingly time.
Bill: And I’m not saying you have to like, watch what you say or anything either. This isn’t “my” server (except when it is), it’s for everyone and if you need to throw some shade to destress it fine.
Bill: Just to be clear. Since Hal *just* went off on making decisions for the group where he shouldn’t.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh that wasnt a group decision? Lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): I think he has a point
Aldus Larian (Jess): Just feels a little late
Bill: Yeah and he’s getting a scold in the admin channel for going loose cannon.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I thought that whole thing already happened
Bill: I said the same thing when we cleared the channel.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah i thought everyone moved past that. did he make an entire channel for everyone but casey? isn't that kind of the thing he's speaking out against right now
Bill: And it’s not an elephant in the room, no one’s really thinking about.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Yea lol like we already were all past that
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): And already know not to do it again
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): So it's weird that he like... made an entire channel for everyone except casey
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ... that she can see
N🆗ri (Marisa): can she see it?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): She cant see the messages
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But she can see the channel
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): At least that's how it is on my other servers
N🆗ri (Marisa): WOW YEAH YOU RIGHT she probably can
though there are also hidden channels
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think this one is a hidden one
Bill: He’s not very smart. There’s ways to do it correctly.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I hope so since she literally was JUST online
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like that's kinda obvious calling a channel elephant in the room and then not having access to said channel
Aldus Larian (Jess): I thought he was gonna talk about Georgia ngl
Aldus Larian (Jess): Like I saw the channel open and I was like 👀
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I thought he was gonna address the asks he got
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like I thought he was about to blame bne , glad it didnt go in that direction
Bill: He’s not put together enough to be running a server, why tf did Georgia give him Admin back.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): But also this is weird
Bill: He’s.
Bill: Ugh.
Bill: TRYING to do good? I guess?
Bill: Or it’s a power play to supersede my commentary in the moment where I scolded the group, making him seem like the good guy in power over me. But he’s not smart enough for that.
Bill: Oh he’s adorable he added EVERYONE to view the channel, rather than just remove Casey.
Bill: God.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Same <@351471675843411978>
Bill: Nice Leanna. Joke, agreement, affirmation of everyone’s points, suggestion for a closing argument wrapped in enthusiasm people can follow behind.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): <:pew:543202259085950996>
