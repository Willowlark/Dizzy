Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Not to bring up unnecessary drama but.....
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Mmmmm ok
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hoping that's not directed at Bne
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I saw that too. Thought it might be about BNE also. Chuckled when I saw Anna comment "say fuck it and leave"
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): YEA LMAO
Bill: Nice Anna.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): LOL
Bill: She. Barely interacts in BNE anyway so. How would she know who people are?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Is BNE on Twitter?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like is she saying that assuming no one’s gonna see?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Some of us
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ~~dumb~~
Bill: Hmm.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Like idk why shed even post that lol
Bill: Imma make a BNE account when I go upstairs.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean, she had a post in her story several weeks ago something similar but it was exclusive to close friends and I dunno how many of y'all are actually on her close friends list besides me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Unless shes trying to start something?
Bill: I’m not.
Bill: Which is a shame, I always liked meg.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm not after she took me off xD
Bill: Lissy too.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m not there either lmaoooo
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Which I still dont know why since I never did anything to her xD
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): /saving that screenshot in case it becomes relevant later
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): XD receipts
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): GOTTA KEEP THEM RECEIPTS
Bill: Sure. Also your username is taken on a Twitter iirc.
Bill: Yuuuup
Bill: ~~I tag him all the time so he clearly doesn’t use the account~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Could do "wezrezcosplay"
Bill: Ye.
Bill: BNE twitter made cause why not <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Remember when Meg said not to do callout posts because that’s immature 😃

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Uhh December 6 is what my brain seems to want to say
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Why
Bill: 16th. I set it as the twitter birthday to be gay.
Bill: *IN case ya'll wondered why was happening on Twitter*
Bill: Man I could probably make a hook to tweet anything posted in out of context. Would I, no.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I should make a Twitter
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Conveniently
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): After being vague posted
Bill: *let's not assume she's talking about BNE shall we*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 🤔 she’s been lurking online all day
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Just sayin
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just don't know what the group collectively has done that would make her feel that way?
Bill: Nothing different than usual. By not saying anything a catty mood of hers can pass by and status quo is preserved.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Exactly
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _and I will hold onto the receipts juuuust in case_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Audrey is a Leo too??

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah it’s less funny now
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wait so me, Bill, Leanna, Audrey
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Are there other Leo’s?
Bill: Lissy.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): F I V E
Bill: Lions live in the Savannah tho.
Bill: But I get your joke.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ye the saying is technically wrong
Bill: You may be the popular one, but I definitely command some ~~fear~~ respect.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ah chronically likeability
Bill: what now.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Remember ethan said
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Chronically likeabl
Bill: Not about me.

Bill: Lets see what happens.
Bill: And about how to get Sheema to leave me alone.

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): is she doing any better :/?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :/
Bill: That's good, in that it's being taken seriously.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i think about the same, they had more test come back negative. now they are going to check for peptic ulcers
Aldus Larian (Jess): she said shes really hungry 😭
Bill: 😭
Elfriede Faun (Tom): They prob have her in a drip to keep her nutrients up but it still succ
