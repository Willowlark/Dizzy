N🆗ri (Marisa): I ran into Hunter a few times this morning and re-introduced myself. He kind of ignored me ;u;
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh :(
Aldus Larian (Jess): 😡
Aldus Larian (Jess): Morning Marisa! 🌞
N🆗ri (Marisa): I thought he ignored me all other times because he was busy but these times he seemed free and I wanted to say hi but maybe I annoy him
Bill: Eh fuck em.
Bill: Seriously don’t dwell on Hunter.
N🆗ri (Marisa): but everyone seems to highly value him and talks of him often I at least wanted to be cordial
Bill: ~~I talk about him to drag him for being annoying~~
Bill: That’s not valuing.
Bill: And IF HE DOESNT APPRECIATE MARISA HE A THOT. THE BAD KIND.
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:rip:369476083248267274> “friend of my friend is also my friend”
Bill: Wwwwwouldn’t say I’m friends with him.
N🆗ri (Marisa): But everyone in BNE is
N🆗ri (Marisa): except me lol
Bill: Eeeeh. Hunter said at one of the shoots yesterday he’s straight addicted to photos. I sometimes think Hunter considers BNE a pool of potential clients.
Bill: He was friends with Casey, but she in Texas now.
Bill: He sees BNE, but he doesn’t hang out with them.
Bill: PA squad sticks with PA even when he’s shooting. Hunter basically wants to be in Virginia with his famoose con friends already.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So total count of that creepy Todoroki guy bumping into me this weekend is 5

Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Is she ok
Elfriede Faun (Tom): :( waaaat
N🆗ri (Marisa): I dunno I’m gonna hear about it in the car after we get our parking reimbursed
N🆗ri (Marisa): She’s telling me after we leave so I don’t go up there and destroy them
N🆗ri (Marisa): But she said she’s not staffing again
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT HAPPENED?! Omgggg 😭
Bill: I wanna see Mawisa destroy them.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We’re running into a lot of other staffer friends also saying this may be their last year
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yikes
Aldus Larian (Jess): Wow
