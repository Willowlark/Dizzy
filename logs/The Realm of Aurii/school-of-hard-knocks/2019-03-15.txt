N🆗ri (Marisa): people can survive for up to three weeks without food! the hospital surely has her on nutrients or something. does she at least get those jelly packets?
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea she is on and IV she's just really hunger
Aldus Larian (Jess): And she's on morphine and still has a ton of pain
Bill: Still no cause?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): She might be able to survive without food but I don't think baby can
N🆗ri (Marisa): the hospital would account for that in the drips
N🆗ri (Marisa): before they'd only let women close to or in labor eat ice while in the hospital
Bill: Oof
Aldus Larian (Jess): Nope they are back to thinking it's her gallbladder now??
Bill: What’s a gallbladder do.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk hopefully the MRI gives some insight
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm gonna go visit tomorrow
Aldus Larian (Jess): After work
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile, a yellow-brown digestive enzyme produced by the liver. The gallbladder is part of the biliary tract. The gallbladder serves as a reservoir for bile while it's not being used for digestion. ... The bile helps the digestive process by breaking up fats.*
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yeeee my mom had hers removed years ago
Aldus Larian (Jess): Idk how surgery works during pregnancy
Bill: Probably emergency c section or whatever for having baby early right?
Aldus Larian (Jess): They arent supposed to c section her because of her blood disorder tho
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh this almost sounds like what happened on an episode of The Good Doctor...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Never mind, remembering that wrong
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea for blood disorders they usually indice or go natural
Aldus Larian (Jess): Walmart discontinued the pants i wear for work RIP me

Aldus Larian (Jess): "sorry, the only CEO I acknowledge is jumin han"
Aldus Larian (Jess): so my sister in law need emergency gallbladder removal she was transferred to a different hospital in an ambulance this morning, its risky cuz she pregnant but there's really no other option
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh no! definitely keeping her in my prayers today. I hope all goes well ❤
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): they figured out what it was though?
Aldus Larian (Jess): thank u fren
yea the thought it wasn't her gallbladder, then did a bunch of other tests and ended up back on gallbladder which i guess the MRI confirmed?
Bill: Better to be sure before removing it... She'll be okay, I got faith.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pwease:555585508819075112>
Aldus Larian (Jess): whats a good thing to bring to people in the hospital?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): entertainment
Bill: We brought Dad a charger, slippers, and his ipad?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): books, laptop, something to watch tv on? comfy clothes ?
Aldus Larian (Jess): i man like as a gift, so while i love my sis in law i wont be buying her laptop or ipad XD
N🆗ri (Marisa): dry shampoo
N🆗ri (Marisa): especially if she stayin' in the hospital for longer
Bill: I mean if your brother hasn't been home, swing by and get her stuff. Not buy new.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oo that might be a good idea
Aldus Larian (Jess): i dont have a ket to thier house
Aldus Larian (Jess): ill ask if they need anything
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Fuzzy socksss
N🆗ri (Marisa): is she artsy? coloring books and crayons

Aldus Larian (Jess): oo coloring book might be nice
Aldus Larian (Jess): im assuming she already has like her ipad and stuff cuz i know my bro went home the other ngiht and like half her family are neighbors
N🆗ri (Marisa): "don't tell anyone at work you're my daughter, keep it secret." - bojo to me

"have you met my daughter? that's my daughter her name is marisa." - bojo to literally every single person who walks through the door
Bill: She proud!
N🆗ri (Marisa): she gonna get us in truoble
N🆗ri (Marisa): no one wants to work here but also no one wants nepotism. but that's literally the only way to get workers in here *because no one wants to work here*
N🆗ri (Marisa): ain't nothin' to be proud of
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHAT
Aldus Larian (Jess): NO everything to be proud of!
Bill: YOU are worth being proud OF
N🆗ri (Marisa): proud of sylvia!!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): a snack fell into a box yesterday and she did her best to dig it out!!
Aldus Larian (Jess): PROUD OF MARISA!
Bill: PROUD OF MARISA!
N🆗ri (Marisa): *SYLVIA!
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~shit im proud of you, your moms gotta be like a million times more proud~~
Bill: ***MARISA***
N🆗ri (Marisa): hi that's my name
N🆗ri (Marisa): isn't it funny how female names change very little over time
you could have an entire lineage of katherines spanning thousands of years
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so now that I posted my lineup, how long until Rebecca decides to bring Raven for Friday morning
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I GIVE IT UNTIL 1PM
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): woops caps
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I feel like she's said she doesn't like doing her before and yet she always brings her back
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah didn't she say the other day she wasn't really feeling raven?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): she says it every single time she wears raven
Aldus Larian (Jess): todays gonna be a day
Aldus Larian (Jess): i can feel it this office has big chaotic energy
N🆗ri (Marisa): stab someone for the ides
Bill: YE
Aldus Larian (Jess): dont tempt me
Bill: STAB ~~ME~~ BILL
Aldus Larian (Jess): i wish
N🆗ri (Marisa): no me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh yeah it’s the ides
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _stab your salads everyone_
Bill: https://www.facebook.com/5903642/posts/10100738522746350?sfns=mo speaking of EMCP...
N🆗ri (Marisa): ooo that's the guy i was talking about yesterday!
Bill: Hence *the speaking of part*
N🆗ri (Marisa): he was definitely sexualizing the child character i was cosplaying
Aldus Larian (Jess): no plz
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): OH GOD
N🆗ri (Marisa): i can share the unedited pics he told me not to ever post <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Aldus Larian (Jess): did i miss the convo about this guy?
Aldus Larian (Jess): was he a creep to u?
Aldus Larian (Jess): do i have to kill?
N🆗ri (Marisa): it was during the convo about biru being worth millions of dollars and how some photogs give sample images for clients to choose which they receive back
Aldus Larian (Jess): OOO
N🆗ri (Marisa): he wasn't creepy, just a bit unsettling?
like how I talk during photoshoots, he does that pep talk stuff but it sounds like it's for gravure models and he'll be like "work it, be sexy, you're so hot" but not in a sarcastic way
Bill: I ain’t worth shit.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no yeah ew that stuff is gross you're worth cash money
Bill: Wait, he shared photos to you that he then said. To never share?
Bill: ...why?
N🆗ri (Marisa): yee
Bill: Just.
Bill: Don’t send them.
N🆗ri (Marisa): they were the samples, i had to pick like 10 of them
N🆗ri (Marisa): but they were good quality
Bill: ~~I’m curious~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): when i get home i can post! i can show you the difference between his and sam's
Aldus Larian (Jess): WTFFFF https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/f_auto,fl_progressive,q_auto,c_fit,w_768/fmdzhffkhaf54mj80emj
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's how he is
Bill: Oh, so it’s like “don’t use my samples for Instagram” not “this photo is of your ass isn’t it great? Don’t tell anyone I took a picture of it tho”.
N🆗ri (Marisa): no yeah not like that
Bill: “It has to be your ass”
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea thats the part that got me
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://tenor.com/view/monkey-surprised-shocked-oh-no-oh-god-gif-5385689
Bill: ~~This exists and I’M the single lonely one~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/f_auto,fl_progressive,q_auto,c_fit,w_768/wirtgzgzdetwbisfdxqo
N🆗ri (Marisa): he'll only shoot what he wants to. his prices were cheap before he got called out and his reputation sunk, i contacted him about shooting sinon and he said never. he said he did a sinon cosplayer with another girl who was awful and ruined the mood? which i assumed to mean he took things too far and she refused to do certain poses so it "ruined" the shoot for him and he was so traumatized by it he didn't want to shoot the character again
Aldus Larian (Jess): prob
Bill: *Marisa stop contacting creeps for photoshoots*
N🆗ri (Marisa): *but there was no one else*
Bill: *Doesn’t matter do not*
N🆗ri (Marisa): does facebook delete old messages? i can't find any of my convos with him. unless i only used my cosplay page
N🆗ri (Marisa): hmm no it's not in my cosplay page either
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh maybe he deleted his facebook account and recreated it
N🆗ri (Marisa): and that erased the messages. darn.
Bill: Likely.
Aldus Larian (Jess): he shoots nudes like straight up
Bill: It's not unheard of.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i know
Aldus Larian (Jess): but thats scary
Bill: A lot of the meetup.com shoots are nude model shoots. Glamour stuff. ~~But that whole thing seems sketchy as fuck so nooo interest~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): he has like one (1) pic of a dude
Bill: The guy is CLEARLY only in it to take lewd photographs, hit on skimply dressed women, and probably fuck with a few.
Aldus Larian (Jess): WAIT 2 dudes
Bill: *Shit* that changes everything.
Aldus Larian (Jess): 1 is just a model 1 is 707 XD
Aldus Larian (Jess): why are people like this?
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh wow he's still updating his page
N🆗ri (Marisa): well there's a big gap with no pictures from around 2018
Bill: Don't ask me. I'm, as Ethan put it, "one of the nice guys who do finish last".
N🆗ri (Marisa): aaaaa that riju is so gooooood
Bill: He's just a tool... Why do people continue to shoot with him? I assume this, being the like 5th version of a blackball post for him, has made it to everyone.
Aldus Larian (Jess): no biru
Bill: That's what I wanna know.
Aldus Larian (Jess): dont listen to ethan
Bill: ~~I listen to the evidence~~
Bill: I suppose there might be some girls who are... what, okay? with being treated like sex dolls?
Aldus Larian (Jess): the evidence that guys like these are scum?
N🆗ri (Marisa): lol
Bill: The evidence that I finish last.
Aldus Larian (Jess): being a dick doesnt get you girls....
Bill: certainly not.
Bill: Which is why I don't get why people still shoot with him.
Aldus Larian (Jess): because he probably prey on naive girls who dont know his rep
Bill: I've seen this post like 5 unique times tho! I'd hope everyone's seen it by now.
N🆗ri (Marisa): probably not. there's a lot of people in groups posting "first con!"
Bill: It's not even like the "Oops LTD is a lowkey creepy, but you can't really tell to you get there" it's like... he's opening message is probably "Nice tits, how do you feel about shirtless".
Bill: Sigh.
Bill: There's plenty of reasons, for sure.
Bill: It's just sad.
N🆗ri (Marisa): is that what he does?????
send that to the con. ltd is on staff.
N🆗ri (Marisa): that's inappropriate staff behavior
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's a department head
Aldus Larian (Jess): i will NEVER give ANY validity to the nice guys finiah last bullshit
N🆗ri (Marisa): oh wait emcp does that
Bill: Ye Marisa.
Bill: LTD is just. off.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i've forgotten how to read <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Bill: Like, I was worried for Gen when she shot with him on location like. Oof.
Bill: She brought Chris though so I was like phew.
Bill: (LTD)
Bill: I should use names and not pronouns.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i think deuce is unknowingly creepy. he's not so bad in person, he's a hype-man and he's in like his 50s so he's using outdated ways of talking that don't suit his age and it comes across as uncomfortable. zero serenity does the same.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): who's LTD?
Bill: Dunno zero, but yeah LTD isn't... trying. He just kinda is.
Bill: A photog.
N🆗ri (Marisa): ltd = deuce cannon or something. he's the head of amvs at zenkaikon and a photographer.
N🆗ri (Marisa): have you met him irl?
Bill: ~~for someone whose got a fear of ever being called out online, I'm sure judgemental of other photographers~~
Bill: Yeah.
N🆗ri (Marisa): orly <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
N🆗ri (Marisa): maybe i don't pick up on his creepiness because i have 0 situational awareness
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s mostly just socially awkwardn
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Harmless tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah that's how it seems to me
N🆗ri (Marisa): he's highly trusted in the staff pool
Bill: I wanna say I'm closer to the cosplayer "side" of things though, than photographer? Cause all my friends are cosplayers, I don't have a business for photos, and keep my shooting to fandoms/people of interest to me?
N🆗ri (Marisa): like, to the point he throws pre-judging amv parties that a bunch of staff attend throughout the year
Bill: And while it's not my safety in question I'm scoping these people for safety and such, so...
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: ~~even if that tru I'm still judgemental lol~~ <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus Larian (Jess): ANNA NO
N🆗ri (Marisa): what what's she doin
N🆗ri (Marisa): is she hooking him up with rebecca lol
Bill: ~~shipping people is a fun past time~~
Bill: But she hasn't been around as long, hasn't put two and two together.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): who is Rebecca doing for that? Bakugou?
N🆗ri (Marisa): who is rebecca cosplaying for the shoot? yeah i think bakugo?
N🆗ri (Marisa): so you'd be... ochako?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So hard pass if they're trying to rope me into doing GB Ochaco
Bill: Do Tsuyu (if at all), she has no interactions with Bakugo.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): also, I feel like Ochaco would be really hard to GB? She's like, too cuddly cute?
N🆗ri (Marisa): you thought
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Unless a very twinky boy did it, of which I am not
Bill: Ye GB Ochacho would be... weird.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i feel like she'd be easy to genderbend. bubbly genki boy next door type.
Bill: I can't picture ochako Yoosung tho.
N🆗ri (Marisa): oooooo nono not like yoosung
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): The only BNHA GB I've thought of is Jirou
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Rebecca does Denki
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): SO
Bill: Hell, the only character arc she ever got beyond "I want Deku's *dicku*" is about people not treating her like girl.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i was about to say thats the only one i could imagine you doing
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that makes me uncomfortable...
N🆗ri (Marisa): sowwy
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): rock lee
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats just rock lee
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I mean, not your fault
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but like
N🆗ri (Marisa): YEAH male ochako is rock lee
N🆗ri (Marisa): THERE SHE GOES
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): boy Ochaco with the Johnny Depp Willy Wonka haircut is......
N🆗ri (Marisa): anna lol
Bill: lol. I get the rock lee comparison I guess.
Bill: Still can't picture it.
Bill: Bakugo with tits in a skirt is a poor genderbend tho.
Bill: Like.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): thats just me trying to be bakugo LmaO
Bill: Put some originality into the bend.
Bill: I hate cheap genderbend designs.
N🆗ri (Marisa): genderbend ochako = coconut head from ned's declassified
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): excuse me... side note... when the fuck did we get a dickbutt emoji in BNE? 😂
Bill: Like, the JNPR ones that went around for cosplans? Effort was put in to not make them 'a woman in his clothes' vice versa, but develop a style that would come from that person growing by a different gender.
N🆗ri (Marisa): a WHAT
N🆗ri (Marisa): it's called :ethan:
Bill: that has Rei written all over it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): biru go see who uploaded that
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): OH FUCK
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): DO I DELETE???
Bill: I stand corrected.
N🆗ri (Marisa): male ochako
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): that literally is
Aldus Larian (Jess): first of all, how dare
Aldus Larian (Jess): but yes
N🆗ri (Marisa): wasn't hal dragging up old drama to say we shouldn't say bad things about ethan in bne
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): RIGHT?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): can't you just.... rename the emoji?
Bill: I can.
Bill: I've given enough lectures on owning what you do on the internet though, so I'm not covering for Hal/the server.
Bill: ... well, the server doesn't know he did it in the first place...
N🆗ri (Marisa): #exposed
Bill: Why is it whenever I try to be a hardass about things I end up doing the nice thing anyway.
N🆗ri (Marisa): hero
Bill: POWAAAA
Aldus Larian (Jess): i actually noticed that a little whole but totally forgot about it
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was just scrolling through emojis and saw it and was like "what server am I in that has dickbutt?" and then saw it was BNE and I was like <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Aldus Larian (Jess): OK so its NOT her gallbladder its a liver disease that will correct itself after the baby is born so now they are basically trying to pump the baby up for premature delivery
Bill: That... sounds better than removal of gallbladder?
Aldus Larian (Jess): not really cuz it puts the baby at more risk
Aldus Larian (Jess): its hard to say which one would be better
Aldus Larian (Jess): its called hellp syndrome
Aldus Larian (Jess): https://www.preeclampsia.org/health-information/hellp-syndrome/
Bill: Just call it help. why two Ls.
Aldus Larian (Jess): H (hemolysis, which is the breaking down of red blood cells)
EL (elevated liver enzymes)
LP (low platelet count)
Bill: It's an *acronym* oooh
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh wow... at least they figured out what it was. I just hope all goes well with everything
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea me too 😦 im like s nervous right now after talking to my mom
Aldus Larian (Jess): the most BS fucking part is that MY mom is there and HER mom is not
Bill: oooof
Aldus Larian (Jess): her daughter has a life threatening condition and shes like "o i have a few more things i gotta do first"
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): wtf
Aldus Larian (Jess): like delivering  firewood
Bill: fuck that noise.
Aldus Larian (Jess): this is all made worse by her not being allowed to have a c-section too, or they have a c-section which will make everything even more risky 😭
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Hunter has requested us to play this song for Ethan at his "party" <@245270932602486784>
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): https://youtu.be/vg2YcHzf20k
Aldus Larian (Jess): They're gonna need to give my sis in law a c section sometime this weekend. Doctors said within the next 48 hrs
Bill: And she's not supposed to get one right.
Aldus Larian (Jess): No it's high risks on top of high risks at this point. But it's their only option since I guess they can't really indice this early
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh yikes :(
Bill: Jesus.
Aldus Larian (Jess): The baby is on steroids to make her strong lungs enough, my sis in law is on other drugs to prevent her from seizing and also prevent the baby from getting cerebral palsey cuz apparently that's a risk too 😭
Bill: and she has the blood disorder too.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea 😔
Aldus Larian (Jess): And her parents still aren't fucking there
Bill: -_-
Bill: Some people don't deserve the title.
Bill: I'm sure the doctors are doing what's safest... Hopefully to keep both healthy.
Aldus Larian (Jess): My uncle is there, but her mom and dad arnt like wtf
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea. My mom said the NICU doctor was able to reassure my brother pretty well. We're probably going to get see them in the morning since they are not in a room yet
Bill: You didn't go tonight? Probably because of the move hospital I guess...
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea I called me mom and she said not to cuz there were so many doctors in the room there want room for anyone
Bill: At least she's getting the proper attention.
Bill: That's good.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Yea thank God
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Your brother must be freaking out. I'd be a wreck in that position. Is he doing ok?
Aldus Larian (Jess): I haven't talked to him directly but mom said he's like trying to hold it together but he's def freaking out
Aldus Larian (Jess): He was worried about even having kids because of her blood disorder. Like was super anxious from the beginning so I'm sure this is nightmare come true 😭
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh jeez yeah
Aldus Larian (Jess): And then for it to not even be the blood disorder but something else on top of it? 😭
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm so sad for him honestly.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Did you say they already have one kid?
Aldus Larian (Jess): No this is their first
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh gotcha
Aldus Larian (Jess): Something tells me it will be their only one lol
Bill: Yeaaaah this scary.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I'm just really praying they are both ok. Cuz my brother will litteraly never forgive himself
Bill: Yeah. That's what matters.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I don't mean to keep bringing everyone down btw I'm just word vomiting my stress all over this channel
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Don't be sorry. Venting is good. We're hear for you 💕
Aldus Larian (Jess): Thank frens 💞
Bill: Ye Jess. I care about what's stressing oyu.
Aldus Larian (Jess): O thank
Bill: Plus your brother and wife were cool from what I remember at the wedding. I want them to be okay.
Aldus Larian (Jess): time to attempt de-stress with alchoholic water and cosplay
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Sounds like a good plan
