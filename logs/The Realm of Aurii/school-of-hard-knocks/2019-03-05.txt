Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I wonder what that kid's up to these days
Bill: ?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I hope hes still just as great
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Didn't he have some rant about sonic the hedgehog or something? Or am I remembering that wrong
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh I think that's what it's from
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I think so?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://youtu.be/_4yDVKidRqA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Enjoy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Frickin' fricks
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): This is prime
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I dont think I ever saw the full video
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): I'm dead
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I want to hear him rant about the movie
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): SAME
Bill: Looks like it confirmed.
Bill: Rip my childhood.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): THATS HORRENDOUS
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): IM SCARED
Bill: ~~okay the furries killed it already but~~
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): What the frick
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Frick* go back
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 😂
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I checked his channel,he's gone through some of puberty but still talked exactly the same
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh no LMAOOOOO
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Just slightly deeper voice
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYyPMVDljrHbUEAjrxNJKPA
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): His actual channel
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wait what happened I was studying
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Lol what is he doing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Bill you already fixed this
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I sometimes shit on Hal for unfair things but like
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yo this redundant as fuck
Bill: Down. He’s trying to do good.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I didn’t say anything mean wtf
Bill: Calling it redundant might set him off again.
Bill: He doesn’t feel like his opinion matters.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It was redundant tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You said literally everything he said after you wiped vent
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he dredged it all back up again? To rehash that?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): This isn’t me attacking him as Hal the ex boyfriend, literally as an admin that was stupid to do
Bill: It was redundant, yes. Somewhat. This wasn’t about that, in the long run. He felt, because I messaged him privately about it, that we discussed without him and he felt like we were doing everything behind his back despite him being part of the admin “team”. He said what he did, rehashing, because he wanted to assert he’s here and also someone who matters in the management. 

Which was all a misunderstanding anyway, we didn’t discuss, I decided and checked in with the two of you. We can’t take back his choice to rehash but we can make him feel he doesn’t need to do another rehash by making it clear we DID consult him.
Bill: Sorry, down was a bit harsh.
Bill: I’m trying to give him validation that we aren’t scheme ing and plotting behind his back, calling the action redundant might lead him back in that direction.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah his insecurities are making him a lame admin
Bill: His actions stemmed from me dming him, which was mostly to keep Rei out of the decision making process (they aren’t a full admin but they are in that chat).
Bill: He’s not really admin material, but he’s the server owner and he’s *trying*. As long as he doesn’t make an ass of himself throwing wrenches in every decision, he’s gotta learn somehow.
Bill: So the reason I said down is I just want him to feel happy with the result, while still having given him the scold for acting on his own. I just don’t want him to jump back down the assumption train that we’re secretly planning against him because he misinterpreted something.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I don’t think he should take me disagreeing with him too personally
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We’re not exactly friends
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Honestly, knowing hal, he probably felt insecure about his place in BNE, and wanted to do something to make sure his presence, even as a member, was known
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Which is lowkey his fault because I told him back in the fall that he should be open and honest to BNE about how he feels and what he’s doing
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And he said “I don’t care what BNE thinks”
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And people kinda did talk but then he became old news, but by that point he had gotten paranoid and was forcing himself on people and in conversations
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): So this is probably just another show of that
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TL;DR you’re right he’s not admin material and he’s making his problems worse
Bill: I need to clean up dinner, bbiab
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We’re not stripping him of the title ofc but maybe he should be discouraged from pulling a stunt without consulting you or me
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Cause he’s gonna keep making an ass of himself
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hence I feel like me agreeing that he was redundant was the extra dissuasion against him being impulsive again
Bill: Delayed. Still. There’s Erik drama. (Not you Erik)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): So I switched to my personal Insta and stumbled across one of my friends from high school. Last I heard he dropped out of engineering school and it appears he's trying to pursue music as a career, which like, props to him, but he was one of those "dudes at the party with an acoustic guitar" type dudes (we called him a guitar douche)
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Like, he's really good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Line REALLY good
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But like, when you watch him play, he makes those super overdramatic "music is in my soul" faces
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He either looks like he's about to cry, orgasm, or have a seizure
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Or a combination of the three
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oof I know one of those
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.instagram.com/tv/BukkpdAjDBK/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=kktx87dc4063
Aldus Larian (Jess): Omg 😂
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just can't... he looks so fucking stupid when he plays 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): get him to wear a mask like daft punk
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Oh man his eyes like roll back
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yo your right hahaha
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): LMAO
N🆗ri (Marisa): omg is this the reason daft punk wears masks
N🆗ri (Marisa): sometimes he looks like a dinner guest who ate something really bad but the hosts are so kind that when they ask "how do you like it?" he takes a big spoonful and nods like "yeah it's delicious!" but inside he's fighting a battle and trying not to reject the horror
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Ok so I'm reading his descriptions on videos
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): He at least knows he looks like a dumbass
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Ok good lmao
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): He was kind of a douchebag in high school and from what I've heard about his college years and what I see now, not much has changed
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just.... *pfft*
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): 😂 😂 😂
N🆗ri (Marisa): uH is there something going around because I got one of those “thanks for being my friend” messages from a Japanese cosplayer
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is it friendship day or something
N🆗ri (Marisa): Hey guys I just wanted to say thanks for bein' my friends <:pew:543202259085950996>
N🆗ri (Marisa): and now a word from our sponsors
Bill: THANKS FOR BEING MY FRIEND
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: <@!245270932602486784> I have to be up way too early and I just had a lovely 3 hour deep as fuck chat about Katy’s relationship so I just don’t have it to say whatever it is I wanted to. I love you, I’m sorry I said “down” so curtly, it was short of me, and I’m just trying to keep things status quo. Hal doesn’t seem to have taken offense anyway so I maybe have been overreacting.
Bill: In other news I should have been asleep two hours ago but maybe, just maybe there can be some damn progress in Katy’s boyfriend Erik being a ghost to the rest of us.
Bill: I need a fucking drink.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): when you're fed up making monthly student loan payments that you switch to monthly loan payoffs...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you know what, fuck it. I have the money in my savings just sitting there accumulating smaller interest than my loans are. I'm just paying them both off...
Aldus Larian (Jess): DO IT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): DONE
Aldus Larian (Jess): Whoop
Bill: What you mean switch?
Bill: But also woo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): now I can focus on building my savings back up and look for an apartment
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ayyyyyyyyyy congrats erik!! thats a big deal!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): THANKS!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): It's really weird because I want to brag because like "HEY I'M DEBT FREE!" but it feels like the same energy about bragging about buying like, an expensive car or something... like, LOOK I HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THIS but at the same time there's a difference between a hefty *purchase* and a hefty *payment*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): so like, I should be excited but I don't want to brag about having the money to do so?
Bill: Nah it’s a big deal. Be excited.
Bill: Making me think tbh.
Bill: I have a lot more than 5k left though.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you also went to grad school too
Aldus Larian (Jess): its def a big weight off your shoulders! congrats!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): thanks!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 20 mins away from midterm on a different campus
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): DriVER OF BUS TAKES A BREAK
Bill: I have a lot more than 5k left though.
Bill: Did. Hunter make a sales pitch on you woo don’t owe money post.
Bill: Or am I crazy.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's what it sounded like to me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which is why I retorted with an actual valid answer
Bill: Lol I missed the answer.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): 
Bill: He's seemed extra pushy on the shoots recently... Hope things aren't going south with his surgery efforts.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i dont think the print sales are doing very well
Bill: I'm not surprised, but that does suck...
Bill: Only not suprised cause I just don't get wanting a print of someone's cosplay. Seems. odd, to hang in your own house.
Bill: To each their own, of course.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): ~~no yea i feel you~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah that's why I don't buy prints
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or necessarily want prints of me sold
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): like, ChocoWaffo sent me prints in thanks for the keychain I sent her and I'm like *great, what do I do with these?*
Bill: chuck em I suppose.
Bill: Even my own photos of people, unless I had a proper 'studio' part of my house where my work is displayed, I don't think I'd want a 13x19 print of Georgia just. Staring at me.
Bill: ~~Maybe Tom and Jess~~
Bill: 😛
Bill: The armonk dress code has definitely been laxing recently and I want to be like 'yo Gord I'm wearing Jeans too' but if he *did* take issue to jeans I'd be ratting out the people who do wear them already.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Yeah I don’t own prints of cosplayers either
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I only agreed to hunter selling them to help him out
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Marketing is his problem now lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But yeah I’m not surprised either, only the fanboi type seem to buy prints
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And if he really wanted to pocket some money, he probably should’ve sold my Pyrrha 🤔
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have an autographed print of yaya han somewhere but that's the only one, and I don't think I bought it.
i have books from cosplay friends in japan. he might have luck at comiket if he compiles the prints into a book. or maybe even here? prints don't sell in japan either but books are popular like enako's one we were talking about the other day
Bill: He likes bees, so bees. Still don't think it'd help sales that mcuh.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’d be better tho
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): He’s not even selling labinnaks ruby
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And that’s her THING
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): what is he selling of hers?
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): nvm i looked
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): yea thats weird
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Hal and meg are in casual cosplay, I can’t imagine that sells well either
Bill: Could be the shoots he's proud of, rather than 'what sells'.
Bill: I get that.
Bill: Not the smartest choice when you want money, but it's understandable.
Bill: Cause he's been on a recent kick with feeling good about shoots.
N🆗ri (Marisa): yeah
casual cosplay would make me uncomfortable to own because that feels like having pictures of random people
Bill: Also, he recently raised his rates so maybe he needs validation he's still worth the money he's asking.
Bill: Or is just looking to make more off of shoots, but he can't said anything like that. Friends are telling him to raise rates.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): i know hes super uncomfortable asking for more money
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): so its probably seeking validation
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): "this is ok right guys?" kinda thing
Bill: That’s what I’d say it is too.
Bill: Legitimate fear too. Man a time have I thought that I’d be done with cosplay shooting if I started charging, cause I’m not worth the cost and certainly at the Volume I shoot Aurii people.
N🆗ri (Marisa): how about a flat photography subscription fee
Bill: Yo SaaS is terrible tho.
Bill: ... ugh, never thought of SaaS for photography but it *could* work... it’d effectively be a retainer.
Bill: I mean I’d never do it cause it’s obnoxious as fuck but.
Bill: Like “pay 49.99 a month for one photoshoot booking a month” who the fuck would do that.
Bill: Booking makes more sense for photos. Particularly in cosplay, but also in general. Unless you rich as fuck and hire a photographer to take your family photos on vacation. Which. Is something I’ve actually seen.
N🆗ri (Marisa): did someone rich hire you to take pictures of their family on vacation
Bill: No.
Bill: Saw an article by someone who did.
Bill: It’s. A gig tho. You shoot all day, expenses paid, go to the places they do, do the events they do...
Bill: I’m just glad I don’t *want* money for photos. Cause valuing yourself versus wanting to do things for friends versus seeing how much your friends value you? That’s. A lot of stress.
Bill: Time is more valuable to me. Admittedly I don’t get/ask for that either but... at least I don’t want money.
Aldus Larian (Jess): meetings fucking kill me
Aldus Larian (Jess): they are so demotivational
Aldus Larian (Jess): ~~especially when you state your idea clearly and everyone heard you and then your boss "comes up" with the same idea 10 mins later cuz hes so fucking old he doesn't remember what happened 10 mins ago~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): great time for breakfast ho
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow your boss must be a genius to come up with totally original ideas that aren't plagiarizing off your ideas
Bill: Ugu.
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Sexism probably
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Some men tend to do *that* especially in work scenarios
Kaio Vermino (Leanna): Heard you, ignored you. Come up with same idea and take credit for it
Aldus Larian (Jess): probably, he is a known sexist
Aldus Larian (Jess): also "I just dont like it" is great constructive criticism
N🆗ri (Marisa): so detailed
such critique
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Rob does that at work to all the underlings
Bill: he's approratiately named.
N🆗ri (Marisa): wow he just..... robs their ideas?
N🆗ri (Marisa): eyyyy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I. Wanna. Go. Home.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh both midterms I ran out of time on
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): But it seemed like everyone else did too
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _two more internship applications and I can go off the “do not disturb” that I’ve been on since January_
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ugh what a crappy day. Those midterms sucked, Hal is getting all attention and appreciation on Instagram with his stupid love thing, Noah is in his own head thinking he screwed his GPA by failing that exam
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m going back to bed
