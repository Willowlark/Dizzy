Bill: @here Kotoricon tickets aren't sold at the door, according to Mark in BNE. If you were interested keep that in mind.
Bill: I think I got Bojo's number via google.
Bill: https://www.peoplelooker.com/people-search/bonita-morrison/
Bill: Would it be weird to call her tho?
Bill: üòè
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Wanna know something cook
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Might snow sunday
Bill: that's past all this.
Bill: I guess. My thought was to go to Georgia's saturday night, but I can play that by ear post Kotori.
Bill: ~~you wanna do that Nier in the snow shoot, that what up~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Lmao
Bill: I'll call Bojo later (posing as a cousin that can sew? All my cousins are weird) and see what she thinks of the airport visit.
Bill: Then we can finalize this.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): So Marisa lands at 8 on Friday right?
Bill: Yeah.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Okay howmst are we coordinating cars if we do go
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Cause airports are hell for cars oof
Bill: I don't know whose going to coordinate.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): lol ive never been to an airport
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): You and tom haven‚Äôt flown ye?
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I would compare the entrance of an airport like trying to drive in New York
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): YIKES
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): nah weve never flown
Bill: Getting into the airport will suck ye.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): this weekend got me all stressed i have no idea what we are doing
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): We are loving Marisa
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): 8 pm on Friday to late Saturday
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): That is the only thing on the schedule
Bill: ~~she's not going to Ice Skating~~
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I honestly have no idea what I'm doing this weekend
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): as long and bojo is ok with it i guess we are doing airport, hotel??? kotori, georgias?? workshop day??
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thats like a assload packing tho and literally no time at home all weekend
Bill: basically my plan.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I mean at least Sunday is crunching
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Which may or may not be what you‚Äôd be doing at home
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea id be doing that at home ~~and would prob get more done cuz so many people is gonna be distracting~~
Bill: I was going to edit photos and socialize sunday... or bring my camera and fuck around with it, if you wanted you could model for that? idk.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): me? i mean id prob still try to get something done idk
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ugh thats $66 for kotori üò¨
Bill: You'd pay around that much for ice skating.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): Ye skate rental is 8 dollar each but factoring in dinner puts them about the same
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea but ill have to buy dinner either way XD
Bill: oh. I figured skate rental would be ~20 ish.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): just with kotori its dinner + 33x2 and with iceskating its dinner = 8x2
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): and there is still the option of neither
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): All this ofc assumes that Marisa flight doesn't get delayed, gotta keep in contact with her
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea that too
Bill: We'd have to leave right after work to get there when she's supposed to get off. Need to risk the delays.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Ngl this whole weekend is unnecessarily stressing me out <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): mood
Bill: Well.
Bill: 1. After work friday, drive down to Phili airport to meet Marisa
2. Crash at a hotel in south jersey 
3. Go to Kotoricon saturday
4. Drive up to Georgia's from Kotori, hangout with BNE
5. Workshop Sunday
6. Go Home. 

The first two depend on Bojo being cool with it. Theoretically could go home after Kotori as well, depending on mood. That's my plan.
Bill: My car and the room are available in that plan. You decide if you want to follow my plan or parts of it or none of it.
Bill: Bojo is completely in support of the idea.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yay!
Bill: What are you doing Jess, Tom?
Bill: Cause I'mma go book this hotel room.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): i dont know yet toms not around right now
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): <@!351785752197201920>
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): we do not in fact , have telepathic communication
Bill: ....~~really?~~
Bill: ~~then what about~~
Bill: ~~that...~~
Bill: ~~with the blake at~~
Bill: ~~nani~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): wow look who dug a joke out of the grave again
Bill: I'll just book the two beds at extra cost.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): thought you were paying on points?
Bill: Those points are not infinite.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea obviously im not stupid
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): but id like to know if there is a cost, im sorry but i cant just call up tom during work to talk about weekend plans
Bill: It's about a 400 point difference or something between the king and 2 queen. I booked the two queen.
Bill: 
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): so you do have enough then?
Bill: Yeah, I do.
Bill: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Penrose+Plaza+Shopping+Center/@39.8970216,-75.2514936,15.45z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c6c470c5168041:0x663bf9861c5ba518!8m2!3d39.9013827!4d-75.2408338 This strip mall is right by the airport. We can gather all cars there and go into the airport short term parking lot with one car, which will be <10 bucks for the time we'll be there. It's no overnight in that lot, so I'd hope we can find a space.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Alrighty üëå
