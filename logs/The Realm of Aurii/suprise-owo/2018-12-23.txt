Bill: Marisa will be at Kotori now too. I picked up the badge as a Christmas present.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Does she know that yet?
Bill: Ye and I made it super clear she should stay home if the travel was too much.
デイブ: Good guy Bill 👍
Bill: Mildly concerned it’d be better to do this Georgia thing and Marisa will feel too guilty to skip Kotori.
Bill: Is *anyone* considering Kotori then? That may be important to Marisa’s consideration.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'm considering but idk
