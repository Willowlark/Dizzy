Bill: <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> Dad says even if I leave at 4 I may not make it in time. I should be leaving at 3, to hope to get through traffic. That... obviously bodes poorly for you.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): Yea def can't leave that early ðŸ˜”
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeee. Well see but I'm starting to lean no now unfortunately... ðŸ˜°
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Not that I don't want to, but so much riding on time and it being the whole reason we're going down... And we might not even make that.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Oof.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Like you said, it's not looking good
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): The absolute earliest I can leave is 4:30 from work so that doesn't really help
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): And even that's a maybe
Bill: I wanna trust google maps's estimates but I also know Dad knows how these things go.
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah I mean the range is huge
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): It says like 2:10 for 3:30
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Hrs:mins
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I think how we're gonna have to run it is...
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): We're a no unless she gets delayed and we have enough notice
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Super sucks but, I can't drive myself crazy anymore trying to figure this out ðŸ˜­
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): marisa first flight is 16 mins ahead of schedule ðŸ˜­
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Which is great for her! But not so great for us ðŸ˜¢
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): yea!

Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Planes are never on time til you need them to be late
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Then they are early
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): of course that means nothing for second flight but still
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Yeah still

Bill: I can like, leave now, but it feels so early it's stupid.
Bill: Thatâ€™s Jimâ€™s cohost and they shit about his weight a lot, but he had to legitimately point out heâ€™s confused how his ex and current romantic interests are all hot and he doesnâ€™t get why their into him despite it. 

Iâ€™m glad heâ€™s shocked cause that sounds like a fantasy world. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>
