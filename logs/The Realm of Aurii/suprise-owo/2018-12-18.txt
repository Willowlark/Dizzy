Bill: Marisa be not in this chat.

She's coming back around 8pm on a friday night, into phili. Was anyone serious about going down to meet her at the airport? Specific date is the 11th. Kotoricon is also that weekend and right there, which I'm at least high key considering going to.
Who Ya (A)Finna Try  (Georgia): I can probably do it
Andrew: I want to
Andrew: Lets do it
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): Andrew is probably the most able lmao
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): I'd like to in theory
Elf(riede) on a shelf (Tom): We shall see
デイブ: OwO
Bill: It'll be tight from our area, but planes always have delays.
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): What time is she *supposed* to land
Bill: 8.
Bill: and I'm assuming it into Phili interational airport, which is south of center city and a 2:15 drive.
Bill: ~~man, how do the leads in romantic movies do this all the time~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~cuz it's not real~~
Bill: ~~It can't be, don't they *work*?~~
Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess): ~~no~~
Bill: ~~then how do they pay for those ridiculously sized houses on a single parents salary~~
Bill: ~~oh right it's always a small midwest town and they don't even have property taxes out there~~
デイブ: "my wife clips coupons and I'm unemployed, we would like to buy this mansion. Our budget is $3.2 million"
デイブ: Your goal would be to leave the area no later than 5:30 to make it to the airport and correct arrival location
Bill: Yup.
