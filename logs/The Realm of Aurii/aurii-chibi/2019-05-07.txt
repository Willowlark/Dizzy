Elfriede Faun (Tom): **Aurri AU:**
***Everything is exactly the same except everyone is madly in love with Nokri.***

Nokri is wandering the town square when Elfriede runs up to her franticly out of breathe. He gets down on one knee and swiftly withdrawels a ring box and opens it.
"Please marry me! Youre the woman of my dre---." 
Suddenly Afina and Aldus shout from behind her, turning her around flustered and confused.
They both also get down and take out rings. "Please marry us Nokri! We need you in our live's forever!"

Elfriede looks disgruntled and embarassed. "It.. it would be acceptable to share you Madam Nokri.." He bows slightly.

More foot steps approach. a darker skinned lagu slides up and presents a ring as well. He smiles clearly showing his fangs in a happy stupour. "You may not know me but you will! I am Chengu! PLEASE MARRY ME!"
NüÜóri (Marisa): Nokri stops dead her in her tracks, clearly taken aback at Elfriede's sudden appearance. The loyal knight from that fateful church battle? She stammers, "h... how did you find me here? Aren't you with the princess? I-"

As if speaking of the devil, the princess herself appears alongside a familiar flash of dashing white hair and pure muscle. All of them offer her impressive stones laden in gold or silver. There was only one logical conclusion as to why this was happening. "Finally," Nokri spoke softly. "I knew this day would come. Mother always said I was worth the world."

She bashfully turned to hide her tears of joy, coming upon another suitor of unknown origins. She grimaced at his toothy grin, but it was ok. Everything would be okay if that ring was at least a full carat.

"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. I can be in all of your lives. Today I'm the happiest girl in the world." Her overinflated ego causes Nokri's head to swell, just like the Grinch's heart. Two, three, four sizes bigger, until her head is so big it lifts her off the ground and she begins floating off to space.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ~~*like in Totally Spies*~~
NüÜóri (Marisa): Legends say if you look up into the sky, sometimes you can see a girl in the stars. A girl with a really big head muttering about diamonds and gold. Parents use it to warn their children of the dangers of greed.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Mistress Tyndall closes the book gently with a sigh, turning to her daughter. A young Afina side-eyed her mother. "So what did we learn from that bedtime story, Afina?" her mother asked.

‚ÄúUhhhhh‚Ä¶ not to trust the judgement of strangers in matters of the heart?‚Äù
