Bill: This is fine./
Nokri (Marisa): don't do it don't be deadpool
Bill: There's so many monsters that spawned immediately damn.
Bill: I figured out how to use the fill command.
Bill: Cool shit.
Nokri (Marisa): what have u done
Bill: building a thing.
Bill: Huh.
Bill: I made this perfectly square.
Bill: according to the coordinate mappings.
Nokri (Marisa): i hope it's a hunger games arena
Bill: The fill command is so nice.
Bill: If you don't mind calculating the coordinates, it's so much easier to build walls.
Bill: this is so coooooolllll
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): whatcha building
Bill: Some kind of large castley thing.
Aldus Larian (Jess): Is it mint eye
Bill: It's literally square on the outside though, cause I built the frame via fill command.
Aldus Larian (Jess): I was gonna do that but it intimidated me lol
Bill: My plan is to modify the top floor (which is why I'm building one and two) by hand, but the box build was so convenient.
Bill: 
Bill: one super shitty looking box building.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there's a fill command?
Bill: For ops.
Bill: I can look into enabling it for all.
Bill: You have to manually put in coordinates though.
Bill: Or use relative to you coordinates.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there's a magic wand mod that makes for easy duplicating of rows
Bill: Dunno if that’s server side.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): idk
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): i dunno how anything works in minecraft
Bill: High key debating making second a floor entirely a dungeon though.
Bill: Ugh.
Bill: Ever put a center stairwell between floors?
Bill: It's super cool on the first floor.
Bill: But now the layout of the second floor is forced into a ring shape.
Bill: Building large Minecraft houses totally destroys the illusion a mansion is cool.
Bill: What do you need all those rooms for.
