Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEAH I hear them say that too and I know it's the character from RWBY but why do they say it? Just because they mine flint and coal?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yee I think it started when the character first premiered, they were mining and someone went “I found flint” or something, and someone else went “flynt coal?”
And it’s just stuck as a running gag ever since <:pew:543202259085950996> they were discussing why they still do it in for a few minutes in one of the episodes where they hunt phantoms
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh yeah because Gavin brought back Mark Nutt
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh bless reddit for having a running list of AH jokes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://youtu.be/N0cOBlKhfxg?t=593
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh that's where Flynt's name originated from
N🆗ri (Marisa): Omg sweet
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ```Flynt Coal is a reference to the Achievement Hunter Minecraft Let's Plays, in which "Flint Coal" became a running joke amongst the cast, also spawning merchandise and a character of the same name in X-Ray and Vav.```
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh dang really?? It’s the other way around? His name came from the let’s play? <:woah:543194447345876998>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah that Let's Play is from 2012 and the FNKI ep came out in 2015
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ironically Flynt is also the name of the character's VA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia):

Elfriede Faun (Tom): When you've wandered so far
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That you come across a nether portal randomly in the wilderness
N🆗ri (Marisa): where is it? :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): someone had to have made it :0

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): is it the one in that big open field with all the sunflowers and animals?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): im BASICALLY making a mini town
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): tho the villagers keep leaving the doors open and letting zombies in
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): rude

Elfriede Faun (Tom): BRBRPBRPBRPBRPBRPBRPBRPBRPBRPRP
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT THE DOORS NOW OMG
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): 
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): upgradessss
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): more rooms hoorah
Bill: should connect it to the plains village I finished.
Bill: Straight north of Marisa.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I need to get back to Minecraft. I haven't been on in like a week lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i can add more minecart routes yes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): are y'all still doing creative
Bill: I am, Georgia's in creative, I think Marisa is still too?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nah Marisa isn't anymore I don't think
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And I never have
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Neither is Jess
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Or Dave
Bill: Ye. I'm... not going to lie, bored with survival.
Bill: I never get the motivation to do anything but build a farm, once I have the farm it's like "I guess I win".
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I finally got an enchantment table!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I need so many books
Bill: So unless we like, do a new world where we squad up in survival, I'mma be in creative.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Mostly leather
Bill: There's libraries in the plains village.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I shall continue to expand the train station later
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I gotta make one track that goes to Jess and one that goes to the plains village
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I actually kind of agree lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And the hotel has 7 rooms now!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm usually very pro-survival
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but trying to find iron gets so exhausting
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TRUE
Bill: 1. we can do a new world if everyone's on board. 
2. can creative you if you like.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think I got bored with creative when playing with my ex's kid
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): plz
Elfriede Faun (Tom): *Going through 1 mine usually gives like 100 iron tho*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): to #2 I mean
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): we've put a lot of work in this world, let's not start a new one lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Worst case scenario we could just finish in that part of the world and drop ourselves in a new location
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And rinse and repeat
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Then we would be building a bunch of mini cities in a way!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I still want to finish my house
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): there's still a giant hole in the ceiling
Bill: I could do a positional warp to some far away coordinates. But I also don't have to delete the world to create a new one.
Bill: @everyone there are command blocks in my original house. One makes you survival, the other makes you creative.
Bill: Don't edit the commands.
Bill: just press button.
Bill: Oh yeah may not be able to, I'm the only person op'd.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): neat
Aldus Larian (Jess): 🎵one pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small🎵
Bill: this isn't about Ethan's constant need for viagra.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Blocks are a neat idea <:shocked_pikachu:511736860859432971>
Bill: In minecraft?
Bill: outright game breaking.
Aldus Larian (Jess): <:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Blocks...... in Minecraft? Wot?
Glonk: Umm, which house is yours bill?
Bill: the one on the lake that mt rigatoni (who the fuck named it that)  overlooks, under Georgia's house.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): i did silly

Bill: Have created a warp point that leads to the area where there's a woodland mansion.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): *"Please Princess Biru"*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lmao
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i be back later friends
Bill: holy shit mansions are huge.
Bill: I say we only go in together, on survival.
Bill: Also if anyone want to build in a new zone, the warp is 9000 blocks away.
Bill: This whole area is woods pretty much too F
Bill: THATs something tho.
Bill: and a portal to hell owo
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Neeto

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): pumpkin pie and lava bucket looks different too
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): nice
Bill: Okay there’s now a little room with command blocks for game mode by the warp point (which is across the bridge between Georgia and Marisa).
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Biru are you okay?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): your head is on backwards
Aldus Larian (Jess): LMFAO
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik):
