Elfriede Faun (Tom): Isn't it amazing how mankinda shapes the world around them into asthetically pleasing and useful structures, they always have. And here we are doing the same but in a blocky world. It's mezmerizing seeing what once was empty mountain ranges get filled with creations. Wack you know?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Side note I think I let the snowmen out
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): *my children*
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): o i didn't see any zombies in the church so thanks for eradicating them

Elfriede Faun (Tom): And its exact coordinates?
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): near me and georgia's house but opposite the nightclub owo
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): it's visible from path we've made but only in the day because there's no light around it at night
Bill: You know those video reviews of games that pop on facebook, with text over the gameplay?
Bill: This one *literally* said critics didn't like this game but we made this anyway.
Bill: anyone heard of days gone tho? ps4, zombie open world game?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Ive literally been looking in that exact.location you described for like 30 minutes lmao
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): maybe he moved it i'll check
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Also ye I've heard of days gone
Bill: none of the reviews are talking about the game play, just the light story.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): whoop there it is
Elfriede Faun (Tom): IS THAT SAND
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That's the best hint I've gotten

NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): i uh

Elfriede Faun (Tom): WOAH

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then blew more up with TNT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Then Thanos snapped the rest
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): But I provided so much meat and eggs for y'all
Bill: ~~I'm pretty sure one of the foxes got salmonilla~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I may have set one on fire
