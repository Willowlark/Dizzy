Elfriede Faun (Tom): From what hahaha
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was traversing the path at night and a creeper popped up and I didn't want it to blow up the path you painstakingly laid out so I haulded ass back to your house to wait it out lol
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Lmao NICE

Bill: Not sure what I was going to do next.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I need to get more clay and clear out that mine
Bill: I found more iron after you left, it's a good vein.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I still need water source lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And adventure with Marisa!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and iron
Bill: I need... to find everyone's houses.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You found mine!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have successfully visited everyone's house

Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not sure if Kurto built one yet but I haven't visited him if he has
Aldus Larian (Jess): im at he bottom of the mountain in between Georgia and tom
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Jess has a very pretty garden out front and a nice balcony
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Marisa's is very cute
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA its like a log cabin thingy
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): the dungeon with the nether portal is very kawaii
Bill: Navigating the mountain is annoying to get to Georgia.
Aldus Larian (Jess): i havnt been to marisas yet
Bill: Jess is on the path between the two?
Bill: I should be able to find that.
Aldus Larian (Jess): yea you take the bring throw the water and i have another path that goes off to mine
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I should build stairs up and down the mountain
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think Tom was doing that
Bill: Oh nice. I did a connection to the path yesterday to my backdoor.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): lots of stairs leading up to your mountain, but definitely some areas that don't
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): let's all quit our jobs and be full time professional Minecraft streamers
Bill: ye no.
Aldus Larian (Jess): YEA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): TIME TO BECOME E-THOTS
Bill: *No one said thots what*
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's how you get the views
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): lil bit of tit-tay
Bill: <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Bill: Running with the thot smile thing aren'tcha.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We all know the yang photo hunter took got 1.6K likes cause you see the boob line
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): _im self aware_
Bill: *incoherent grumbling about that not even being your best feature*
Bill: *more grumbling about Hunter because Hunter*
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Tru I haven’t posted a pic of the thot smile 🤔
Bill: You don't *have* to. Err. I'd say don't actually, cause all you need is some creep taking thot smile as 'i'm a thot'.
Bill: Better as an among friends.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I mean Erik and I are dropping out of lucrative engineering jobs and a physics degree to be e-thots so
Bill: Go for the one with the paycheck.
Bill: *trust me* it's worth it.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I built a road from my house to Jess’s and from some existing road also
And made an arrow at the village to know what direction rigatoni is in
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Ah yes mt rigatoni
N🆗ri (Marisa): We need to find a jungle I want a cat
N🆗ri (Marisa): This dog that randomly spawned in my house is ok but it’s no cat
N🆗ri (Marisa): And watermelons
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WATERMELONS YEA
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We find one on our adventure Marisa
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yeah! I'm almost done with the road, just need the path to Georgias to be completed and the steps down the mountain
N🆗ri (Marisa): do we have any plans on what to do? we're makin' roads and whatnot, should we aim to someday make like a big city or are we just gonna do whatever we feel like
Bill: Nah. I'mma wanna make maps eventually probably.
N🆗ri (Marisa): i have a map but it only shows my house and the village oops. working on expanding it
N🆗ri (Marisa): if anyone finds my house and the books inside feel free to read them just put them back pls
N🆗ri (Marisa): can't stop thinkin of minecraft
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): mood
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’ve played so much that I’m thinking of real life in Minecraft terms
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I just thought “I have to get back to my dorm before the monsters come out”
N🆗ri (Marisa): Carry a sword with you
N🆗ri (Marisa): Irl
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m trying to plan stuff I want to do and what priority to do it in
Watermelons and ocelots big priority but it’ll take a while because that’ll take a lot of searching and adventuring and preparation 
Maybe first I’ll find more sunflowers, improve my house, and find out how to stop wolves from brutally murdering my sheep
N🆗ri (Marisa): A trap that shoots arrows at anything that gets near the sheep maybe <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): or pen your sheep?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): SUNGLOWERS
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): flowers, same thing
N🆗ri (Marisa): They’re in a fenced enclosure that’s two fences high but that doesn’t stop the wolves <:rip:369476083248267274>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): that's weird...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Wolfies killin ya sheep?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oooo I need a saddle still
N🆗ri (Marisa): One wolf got one from outside the pen and then next I went out there were no more sheep and a wolf inside the pen
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): can we try to hoard iron and start making armor?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Yeah!! We need iron for armor and train tracks
Aldus Larian (Jess): armour?!
Aldus Larian (Jess): wowie flower picking simulator is crazy
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): We need creative for a hot second to compensate for the BLATANT lack of iron
N🆗ri (Marisa): I had leather boots ~~my boots with the fur~~ but they broke
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have about 50 iron
Aldus Larian (Jess): i have about 74 poppies
Aldus Larian (Jess): lotsa rose bushes
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I have...
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have like 35
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): No 25
N🆗ri (Marisa): Literal rays garden
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): not a lot of useful materials
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): except glass. I have quite a bit of glass
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Erik go on a mining adventure with me like Bill did
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I will!
N🆗ri (Marisa): I have a few stacks of Redstone, some lapis lazuli and diamonds that I’m hoarding like crazy, and lots of cobblestone
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was trying to find y'all last night but then I got distracted with something else
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): It’s hard mining alone cause you can’t watch for monsters
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oh that’s another thing I wanted to do, enchant a pickax to have soft touch to harvest big mushrooms
N🆗ri (Marisa): Make your own tunnel! Then you can hear them
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like bill and I got swarmed by like 4 zombos at once
Bill: Mine Together!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): oh I have a lot of torches
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I also have two phantom membranes in case anyone makes an elytra and needs to repair it
Aldus Larian (Jess): i got lost in the mountains and lost all my peonies
Aldus Larian (Jess): cuz i died
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): WHOA HOW DID YOU KILL ONE
Bill: I have lots of steak.
Aldus Larian (Jess): oh tom killed 2 of those too! they keep spawning ove rhouse
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I need to kill a slime to make reins for llama
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have lots of coal and bread
N🆗ri (Marisa): We gotta go to the end there are plants there I want and we can get elytraaaaa
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Oh no wonder we get a lot of Phantoms. They're attracted to people who haven't slept in days
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Oh HUH that’s weird
Aldus Larian (Jess): OH
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I just let them swoop down on me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and then beat the shit out of them with my stone sword
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): died like twice in the process but it was right at my front door so it was all good
Aldus Larian (Jess): that would explain why they didnt spawn after is died
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Like a piñata
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think dying affects their spawning. It's specifically not sleeping for more than 3 days
Aldus Larian (Jess): oooo ok
Aldus Larian (Jess): i ahve never slept whoops
N🆗ri (Marisa): Make a bed in your house or you’ll be lost when you die
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think any of us have lol
N🆗ri (Marisa): I did setting my new spawn once
Aldus Larian (Jess): but i gotta like kill sheep for that right? D:
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): can we all sleep next time we're all on so we can establish our spawn points?
N🆗ri (Marisa): You can sheer the sheep!!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you can make shears!
Aldus Larian (Jess): WHOA
N🆗ri (Marisa): If only there were shears for leather...
Aldus Larian (Jess): got no time for things like sleep, gotta plant flowers
Aldus Larian (Jess): and build rooftop terraces
N🆗ri (Marisa): How u make such a nice house
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeah just skin the cows one layer of skin at a time and let it grown back
Aldus Larian (Jess): WOOD
Bill: Oooh Marisa and Georgia getting to play while we work makes me salty.
Bill: ~~shuts down server during work hours~~
Aldus Larian (Jess): wow that would be so rude
N🆗ri (Marisa): I only played a little bit this morn owo OH GEORGIA IS ON NOW hhhh I wanna go on but I’m washin this area
N🆗ri (Marisa): Georgia, jungles also have baby pandas which can drop slime balls when they sneeze. We gotta find one
N🆗ri (Marisa): What time does everyone get done work. Can you, like, leave early.
Bill: I’m kidding.
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
N🆗ri (Marisa): we need stuff to drop so if we go exploring we can find our way back. Torch paths or something
Aldus Larian (Jess): im ussually home at 5:15
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok cool hurry hurry
N🆗ri (Marisa): No pressure
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I leave at 4:30
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I'm making dinner tonight so I probably won't be able to get on until like 7
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): big sad
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a soggy dog world out there let them fend for themselves
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ;3c
Bill: I won’t be HOME till 7.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Girls night on the Minecraft server no boys allowed
Bill: But I did get annoyed and upped the specs of the server yesterday and I’m wondering what that’ll bill at...
N🆗ri (Marisa): 5-7:30 girls night 
7:30-10 open mine time
10-12 adult swim
N🆗ri (Marisa): Should we all pitch in to help pay!
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I have class 6:40-8 :c
N🆗ri (Marisa): Girls night shall be extended to midnight no boys allowed
Bill: Eh. I’m the one who upped it. Unless it’s stupidly expensive...
Bill: But it’s usage based so I have no estimate. Find out next month!
N🆗ri (Marisa): How expensive could it get?
N🆗ri (Marisa): Is usage based on how often people are on the server? Or how many chickens we spawn?
Bill: CPU cycles.
Bill: https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/13010909/android/sticker.png;compress=true
N🆗ri (Marisa): <:huh:555585958146473984>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/d/d2/707_Sticker_02.gif
Bill: I sounded like a defender of justice didn't I.
Bill: God
Bill: Bill!
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mystic-messenger/images/d/d6/707_Sticker_03.gif
N🆗ri (Marisa): Should we keep playing to a minimum unless everyone is online? Or is it ok for us all to play 24/7?
Bill: Play whenever you want!
Bill: If it became costly enough to shut it down, I would.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Oki I just don’t want you footed with a $10000 payment
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
N🆗ri (Marisa): Does this sound right
Bill: Huh.
Bill: Weird.
Bill: Dizzy hasn't been down for any extended period of time in the last few months.
Bill: AAAAAH that was the DB instance I deleted.
Bill: I didn't even use it and I paid 8 bucks a month for it for months.
Bill: so approximately 750 hours in the month, 0.0464 per hour, most minecraft can possible be is 35 bucks.
Bill: Not a huge deal.
Bill: Would have perferred the 15 bucks of the other tier, *but I ain't dealing with all that lag*.
Bill: Oh right, the unlimited mode... hmm.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Ok phew. And if it reaches that high we chip in
N🆗ri (Marisa): I was afraid of like. $100+ dollars
Bill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill: I wouldn't have started the server if I didn't mind paying.
N🆗ri (Marisa): All gold found in the game will be used to build Biru-sama’s house
Bill: that gaudy no.
N🆗ri (Marisa): We’ll surround it with towers of pimps
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): all gold found in game will be used to erect a Tower of Pimps in front of Bill's house
Bill: ~~I am the least pimp like person~~
N🆗ri (Marisa): Take the tower
N🆗ri (Marisa): It’s a rooster teeth thing u like rooster teeths
Bill: I hate RT.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB3ifaFDObc
N🆗ri (Marisa): aww man Georgia’s not on Minecraft anymore I was just going on
N🆗ri (Marisa): Aaaaaa I just lost like 50 iron, 10 lapis, gold, and my diamond pickaxe going up to my house. It was all gone when I went to retrieve it aside from the stone I was carrying. Can we keep our inventories when we die? There’s a command Biru can do for that. Or is that too much cheating
Aldus Larian (Jess): ALL THE CHEATS <:rise:557579163511554050>
N🆗ri (Marisa): Full on creative might take some of the fun away but all that iron..... lost forever.......
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Yeah creative gets boring but keep inventory is convenient
Bill: Someone tell me not to install minecraft on my work laptop and attempt to play via phone tether.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Do not
Bill: That's no fun.
Bill: I'll go through picture instead though I guess.
N🆗ri (Marisa): I made the map as big as possible but it only shows my house eifosybwkfgaifhah
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: You have to... go to the places to fill in the map.
N🆗ri (Marisa): But it’s all the area behind my house
N🆗ri (Marisa): You guys are to the left
N🆗ri (Marisa): When it was smaller it showed my house and the village, still does but I thought it’d show the left also
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@386874959009415170> when you get on there's some iron in my chest if you need a little
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Coo
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Thanks
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i can give you some too ye
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): at least enough for a GOOD pickaxe
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): yeeeee
N🆗ri (Marisa): Unbreakable pickaxes aren’t really unbreakable Minecraft lies
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): you broke a diamond pickaxe?
N🆗ri (Marisa): No i lost three of them but my unbreakable iron one is losing durability
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Unbreaking isn't unbreakable yee
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Infinity bows tho
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You can also combine iron with it on the anvil to repair it
