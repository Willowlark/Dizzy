Bill: Also any chunk we've already visited will not spawn new things from the 1.14 update. SO you'll have to move from spawn to find a new village, the village near Marisa will not update.
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): then i guess neither will the 3/4 other villages i've found <:rip:369476083248267274>
Bill: yeah. If people have explored far from spawn, weeeee may not see a few of the new features.
