NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): Where the fire?
Bill: nether rock burns forever.
Bill: also @everyone if you want creative mode instead of survival just ask.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): can i have it in this moment
Bill: I have to log in to switch it for you, so it's more a mode switch than temporary.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): ye thats fine if you can
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): i just wanna build stuff
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): wait can you even do that right now? arent you at werk
Bill: I work from home fridays remember?
Bill: I could even if I didn't though... I can install minecraft on my work machine, or SSH into the server console and run the command from there.
Bill: I was going to do the latter but my laptop decided to do a half hour update
Bill: I'm a l33t H4x0r g0d after all.

Elfriede Faun (Tom): Me playing 1 life mode where I'm not allowed to surface like a madman, trying to build underground gardens and shit
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I didn't survive
Bill: you'd be safer ON the surface.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): THATS THE POINT
Bill: Also dunno if you can do hardcore as a player specific mode.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Nah it deletes the world
Bill: You can set it for a server.
Bill: You get locked as a spectator if you die.
Bill: Can't do it as a player mode, only server wide.

NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): and covered up my nice hole
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): did someone fall down the hole again <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): may have spawned a chicken in your house
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): and put a safety trap door over your hole
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): took one (1) egg to spawn that chicken in your house and then I unloaded like 20 at mine and only got a single chicken
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm trying to start getting animals but there's only pigs and llamas near me
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I need cows
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): the hole is very safe and perfectly OSHA compliant
OH MAN yeah chicken eggs are weird
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): cows u gotta drag from halfway across the world
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): was lowkey tempted to steal one of y'all's cows and lure it back to my house but that would be so far to lure it
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): see if biru can give you creative for a little bit next time he's on and get a cow egg
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): no that's cheating
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he said, falling to his death but keeping his inventory
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I was gonna also try to get one from the open field where the one nether portal dumps you
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Oh with the huge amount of animals?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): but I think I killed them all. there's only horses and pigs and sheep
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): YEAH
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yo that's. Sweet field
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YOU DID WHAT
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I NEEDED BEEF
Elfriede Faun (Tom): BOI
NðŸ†—ri (Marisa): o it looks like someone found my other mine

Elfriede Faun (Tom): I found several zombie spawners!
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And a whole lotta melon
Elfriede Faun (Tom): And saddles
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): How many saddles?
