Bill: Who does not have feathers, hence the confusion.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So apparently pumpkins don't naturally spawn with faces to make golems anymore
Elfriede Faun (Tom): You need to find the carved versions in woodland mansions
Bill: oh?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): So time to explore yall
Bill: There's an op command to give you the coordinates of the nearest special structure like that.
Bill: I can do that and give you a direction to go in if you'd like.
Bill: Course, I did it with something and it was 9000 blocks away.
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I would wanna see a woodland mansion 😮
Bill: mm, me too. I hope that's not what I looked for.
Bill: oof.

N🆗ri (Marisa): <:lenny:395307171539189760>
N🆗ri (Marisa): the bookcases make the enchanting table stronger so by removing two of them u made it weaker. you fool.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I don't think I did any of those things but I did accidentally mess up your doorbell. I tried to fix :c
N🆗ri (Marisa): that ok! the notes are equal now!!!
N🆗ri (Marisa): im not angry just very confused and wondering where my bookcases and flowerpots and the stuff from the basement chest went
N🆗ri (Marisa): *someone might frame me for a crime*

he will guard my house unless he runs away to a village which i hear might happen
N🆗ri (Marisa): 
Bill: I need to teach everyone to use the damn discord overlay.
Glonk: I was exploring everyone's houses last night and read about the chickens. Went to check that out and for some reason a creaper spawned and blew up in your room. The casualties were the bookcase and the chest. I made 1 bookcase (not enough mats) and made a chest and filled that with what exploded out of it
Glonk: Idk how the creaper spawned, maybe it's like the chickens
N🆗ri (Marisa): :0
A creeper!? There have been a lot spawning near my house but I thought it was well lit. Hmmm
I’ll light it up more, thank you for repairing it!!! I appreciate it, you coulda totally let it be and I’d of been like “o a creeper exploded rip”
N🆗ri (Marisa): At least my cat CD survived thank goodness
N🆗ri (Marisa): And my diary
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did you read my diary :3c
Glonk: I tried making a golem too, but as Tom did research this morning, a regular pumpkin does not work as a head
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Marisa did my horse die? I was away in the nether and now he's gone
N🆗ri (Marisa): In the front yard? No he just wasn’t there at one point I thought you moved him :0
N🆗ri (Marisa): Did he teleport to you? Sometimes dogs and cats do that
Glonk: Did not read
N🆗ri (Marisa): My private diary is a literary masterpiece
Glonk: Gave pets to the doggo tho
N🆗ri (Marisa): i hope u find your horse it matched your armor
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I think he died or ran away
Glonk: Also there was a horse burning itself alive while I was playing last night, might be what you're missing
Bill: you can make a lead, and tie off a horse to a fence.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I need slime for a lead
Glonk: I don't remember the color, was hard to see through the fire ~~and the flames we carry on~~
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): Nah this was recent
