Elfriede Faun (Tom): YEAH GOOD LUCKY
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): speaking of recreating Notre Dame in Minecraft...
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhHz0grwemU
N🆗ri (Marisa): Creative mode? 👀 
Do you have a link to that skin creator
N🆗ri (Marisa): Last night I tried planning a house in creative mode, there are so many new blocks that are like impossible to make
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): https://www.minecraftskins.com/skin-editor/
N🆗ri (Marisa): bless u
N🆗ri (Marisa): and ur chickens
N🆗ri (Marisa): Night time is horrifying I died like 5 times but also there’s a village nearby!!
Bill: OOO
Bill: I need to remember how to make maps.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Lots of paper
One of the guys in the village will trade an emerald for 32 papers
Glonk: A compass surrounded by paper
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): ^
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): which I believe compass requires redstone?
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And this world got NO mined materials
N🆗ri (Marisa): ^^^^
N🆗ri (Marisa): Where’s the iron
N🆗ri (Marisa): Where’s anything
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I've only found coal so far
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): Coal 4 Dayz
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I’m gonna adventure after class at 1:40 and the physics club hack
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): A very long voyage
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): For some freakin coal
N🆗ri (Marisa): I’m in a cave searching for iron, wiki says it’s best found 5-25 blocks below ground level
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): I hopped into at least 5 caves and the mountain range and found nothing
N🆗ri (Marisa): New plot of Aurii: find iron
Bill: oof redstone and iron to make compass for map.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): he's getting there... I've been putting off actually making his torso
Bill: that's impressive.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): it's surprisingly fun to make these
Bill: I like pixel art (more sprites like GBA games but I digress) but I can't like, make it look good.
Bill: I can't show detail with so little detail.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): I'm really glad there's a feature to add different tones of the color you're using so it's not just flat
Bill: aw fuck and you need sugar cane for paper.
N🆗ri (Marisa): Isn’t there sugar cane near your house? Or are those flowers
Bill: wheat, trees...
Bill: no sugar cane.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Compass takes redstone and maybe gold
Elfriede Faun (Tom): That might be the clock
Bill: Iron and redstone.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): all of the exact components we *can't* find <:rip:369476083248267274>
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Iron doesn't spawn neear the surface I know
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Only coal
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Iron is a little down, gold is further and diamond is near the bottom but not too close
Bill: I found a little iron.
Bill: was pretty close to surface level, but inside the mountain.
Bill: So it may have been enough blocks deep because of that.
Bill: Has anyone found a big cavern system open to the suface level yet?
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Yep
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Right of Elfriedes dirt hut
Elfriede Faun (Tom): I boarded it up with wood
Elfriede Faun (Tom): Cuz zombies were pouringnout
Aldus Larian (Jess): lmao
Aldus Larian (Jess): Dont Dead, Open Inside
Bill: yeaaaah apparently iron is more common at bedrock.
Elfriede Faun (Tom): YESSSS
Elfriede Faun (Tom): <@351471675843411978> PERFECT REFERENCE
Bill: I was going to wiki instead of work, but... I kinda just wanna stumble around doing stuff.

Elfriede Faun (Tom): MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE THAT

Afina Tyndall (Georgia): And I’ll use glass so you can see it flow
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): My goals today are to find iron, start my barn, and finish my room behind the lava-fall
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): My goal will be to fucking find y'all
Bill: I'll warp you if you like.
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): then I'd need to find my way back to my house lol
Afina Tyndall (Georgia): You’re not on the path?
Chengu Tiaowen (Erik): although we can pull up coordinates can't we?

Bill: Did you sleep in a bed? Maybe your spawn changed.
N🆗ri (Marisa): nop. i kept meaning to make a bed but every time i got the supplies i died
N🆗ri (Marisa): there's a weird dirt sculpture which makes me think the spawn is the same, but i don't see the lights from anyone's house just lava
N🆗ri (Marisa): minecraft SUCKS
Bill: the dirt arrow points to me.
