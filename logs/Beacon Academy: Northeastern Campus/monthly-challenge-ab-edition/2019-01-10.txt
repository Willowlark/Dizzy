Erik (Red Riot Thot): Day 7 done <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I started to do it tonight and then I remembered... I was never and still am not flexible enough to properly do sit ups or crunches... ðŸ˜­
Erik (Red Riot Thot): definitely strained a muscle in my back doing sit ups yesterday... RIP
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oof,sorry to hear it
Jess (whoozica): Yeah I have a tendency of hurting my back too? I think my form is wrong or something
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Make when you do these kinda of workouts you're using your core. That's how I herniated my disk was not using my core and using my back. Back is an important part, but tighten your core as well to give yourself more support!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah I have to really concentrate because I've been noticing that I sometimes use my back and legs instead of my core
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So like pretend you're sucking your gut in for a picture or something when you do a crunch or sit up
