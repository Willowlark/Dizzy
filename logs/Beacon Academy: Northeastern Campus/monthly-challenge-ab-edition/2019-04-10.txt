Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): wotagei is a good way to exercise
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what i want to know is how hes doing this all so fast
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ive been doing this monthy challenge thing for 9 days and im slow as fuck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and hes on like day 7 and SPEEDING through situps and pushups
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how the fuck
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The comments drag the whole thing a bit.
Matt (mattmyers25): He is secretly 1 punch man
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He's probably already fit, he's just toning. Which I'd believe cause that's a bit *too* easy looking.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~asides from the fact you'd need to quit your hob to do that much exercise holy fuck~~
Anna (blonde and sad): I mean not really. You just need no social life
Anna (blonde and sad): And a very short commute time
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): maybe because of school differences? my school never made me do a proper push-up or a sit-up so i can't do one to save my life but they have to do them every day in japanese schools, so maybe he had the foundations to do it. he doesn't look rreally out of shape in the first pic, he's pretty muscular
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): a day 10km run every day would be like 3 or 4 hours, for me. Or more.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I walked the mile in high school and it took 24 minutes so.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): they let you walk it???
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Define "let".
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): my leg was messed up and they forced us to run it, no walking allowed. if you were walking for more than like 5 seconds you'd get yelled at. i had to bring in a doctor's note and everyone started spreading rumors i didn't have to do the mile because i suck but they made me run it the next week anyway
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): and then when i did run it i was dying and i had issues on the bus because of the messed up bus seating hierarchy
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): schools suck
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): did u cheat
Jess (whoozica): D:!
Jess (whoozica): yea our school was pretty lax
Jess (whoozica): i did mine in 14 but i walked half
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i did it in like 12-13 but i was one of the slowest, most were around 10
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): im gonna sue my school
Jess (whoozica): DOIT
Anna (blonde and sad): We had to do ours in 15 minutes or less bc some kid in a wheelchair did the mile in his wheelchair in 15 minutes so that became the standard
Anna (blonde and sad): Idk in middle school it took me like 13 minutes. In high school I think I did it in 9 or something bc it was the middle of field hockey season and we were really in shape so me n my friend ran the whole thing n we even got to wear cleats. 
I wish. I was in the shape I was back in high school. Damn.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): im lookin at video of my school and it's crazy how most of the teachers are still the same
and then i feel bad because i remember taking certain classes but can't remember a single thing about the teacher rip
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): like. it was a woman teacher. that's all i remember
Anna (blonde and sad): I remmeber. Way too much
Anna (blonde and sad): Waaaaaaaaaaay too much
Anna (blonde and sad): Half my college profs? Nope.
Anna (blonde and sad): High school? Unfortunately
Anna (blonde and sad): I don't miss gym class lmfao
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i'm still tryna find the video of the kid juggling knives during the male beauty pageant that was lit
Anna (blonde and sad): Oh. I was lifting ladders so I guess I did the arms portion of today.
Anna (blonde and sad): Gotta do the squats later
