Jamie (Jamie): Dear tall ppl, when using machines at a gym is it as annoying to you to use one after a short person as it is to me a short person after a tall had used one? Lol
Jamie (Jamie): So im not sure why i always think I take less time than i do at the gym. Thought oh yea I'll be home by 11 easy. I'm just leaving PF lol this time was nearly 2 hours
Mark (Mad Doctor): When I go to the gym first thing in the morning, the machines are usually set to the shortest possible setting. I never really mind adjusting them, but then I never return them to the previous setting, either. I figure it all evens out in the long run
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The only ones I really have to adjust too much are the bike and the abdominal
Mark (Mad Doctor): Have lost five pounds since New Year's. If I can lose 20 more by July 4, I'll wear Speedo Qrow to CCE. If you don't want to see that, buy me cake
Georgia (Something Sensible): what a pro strat, either you get cosplay or cake, you never lose
Mark (Mad Doctor): Indeed
Jess (whoozica): Day 21 I died
