Evie (Katheryne Knight): I need to tone up that area bad so at least I'll be doing this on top of a normal session
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So a good run, abs, and leggy today for me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Just remember that with any workout, your diet is even more important so if you're trying to lose some tummy, you can't be eating garbage
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~says the person who polished off a bag of chips after work yesterday~~
Jess (whoozica): Im trying to get in the habit of drinking more water too

Erik (Red Riot Thot): honestly if you prepare veggies the right way, they can be so good
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): <@334090409389195266> mood

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cauliflower is the bomb 👌
Erik (Red Riot Thot): coffee's actually not that bad as long as it's not loaded with sugar
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~my coffee is always loaded with sugar lmao. oops~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Coffee, WITHOUT sugar? yikes
Jess (whoozica): my coffee is just bean water
Georgia (Something Sensible): Speedy bean juice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): if you need sweetener, stevia is a good option
Georgia (Something Sensible): I heard there was some carcinogen thing going around about the fake sugars
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've tried stuff like that but I just don't like them >.< I think imma just need t start forcing myself to use them and get used to them...  or just not use sweetner lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): In case that plays a role in anyone’s sugar selecting process lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Stevia's the current best one last I heard. Splenda gives you cancer or something.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Truvia is made from alcohol sugars and that makes it the best one~~
