Erik (Red Riot Thot): Day 6 done
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Are these meant to be done in one go or can you space them throughout the day?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I believe its 1 go but I see no reason why you can't space them out especially at higher numbers
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's what I was thinking. I don't think I'll be able to get up to 125 situps and 200 crunches in one go
Jess (whoozica): You can also do like a set of twenty five and then do another excerse for a while and then 25 more that help me when I'm trying to get 100
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I spaced them out and didnl them in sets when I did this before because 200 sit ups in one go is killer if you aren't used to it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Fuck I'm struggling right now because ab day sucks
