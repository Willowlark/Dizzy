Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😏
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Just the tip
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Idk a lot more than just the tip went in pyrrha
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I really want to wear Raven but she's a lot to put on just for a small event like that lol. ~~id do casual but don't think I really have much that would work~~ so I'm leaning towards wearing Sun 🐒
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): A good banana boi
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Also
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): <@288513265661902858>  that was dirty and hurtful
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): You're right
I was wrong, pyrrha never even got 'just the tip' from the person she wanted to

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She never would tho.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!155492347122155520> what was the station you said you go to when you train into NY?
Matt (mattmyers25): Lyndhurst
Matt (mattmyers25): My gf used to live there so we drive to that station and take the train in from there
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think I might be the only cosplayer at Plymouth Meeting this year, unless I force Audrey to wear Oscar. I was gonna do Qrow again, since he's the most comfy
Jess (whoozica): I wish we all lived closer so we could cosplay to the premiere together, but alas a thursday not is not ideal 😭
Mark (Mad Doctor): And a school night, no less
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and there's parking near there <@!155492347122155520> ?
Erik (slendergiant): Whose brilliant idea was it to hold it on a Thursday?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Rooster teeth; the masters of smart thinking.
Erik (slendergiant): But like, *who* at RT?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think its amc actually who decides that
Erik (slendergiant): It's not necessarily AMC. RT has to schedule it with Fathom
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's RT.
Erik (slendergiant): Because I'm pretty sure Regal shows it too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~whoever is in charge of the events at the theaters~~ they usually do these kind of events on weds-thrusdays because its not high traffic days at the theaters
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RT schedules at Fathom, Fathom negotiates with theatres.
Erik (slendergiant): True
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Its not RT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): less money lost if the event is a flop
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because shut down a showing room for it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Thursdays are the day of the week theatres put in new movies/start the schedule and block out rooms
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Most 1 time events are scheduled on a thursday unless they repeat weekly
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ^^^^
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That way sales gets the most of out a weekend
Mark (Mad Doctor): Older people tend to go to the movies on Thursday. It was fun watching their reaction to cosplayers last year
