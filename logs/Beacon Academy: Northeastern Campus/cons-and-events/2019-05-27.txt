Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Friend of Georgia.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Geoff.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ye! thats my friend geoff!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He really should have been given an award at the formal.
Georgia (Something Sensible): he shouldve
Georgia (Something Sensible): he was so elaborate and it was perfect for JUST katsu
Georgia (Something Sensible): i chalk it up to the unfortunate "female cosplayers get a lot of attention" thing
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): they usually pick a king of the katsucon formal too? a king and queen?
maybe they cut it down to just one person because that caused issues
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ye they only picked one the last two years I think
Georgia (Something Sensible): It was tiana this year and some ball gown the year before
Georgia (Something Sensible): Before that it was a lelouch and ballgown CC
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i remember the tiana she was so cute
there was one year they chose a Mabel from Gravity Falls and her dress was insanely perfect
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): this girl yesss
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i think she was two years ago
