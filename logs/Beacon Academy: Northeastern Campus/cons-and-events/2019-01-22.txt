Jess (whoozica): yea thats bs
Anna (Cadmium): wait im super confused https://www.showclix.com/event/color-factory-new-yorkj4io394jg32
Anna (Cadmium): through their own website its got weekends
Anna (Cadmium): We want you to have fun and take in every moment. Please take as many photos as you like, but please be considerate of others enjoying the exhibit. There are photo booths integrated throughout our space to give you an opportunity to put your phone away, be in photos with your friends and family, and appreciate the exhibits more fully. Despite our best efforts to keep cameras & their lenses clean, operational, and calibrated correctly, we do experience equipment failure from time to time. Because we can't guarantee every photo station's equipment at any given moment, make sure to take all the photos you'd like as you travel through the exhibit. Tripods, excessive props, commercial or product shoots, media shoots, press interviews, and all professional video equipment are prohibited without advance approval and accompaniment from a Color Factory representative. Contact us at press@colorfactory.co for requests.
Anna (Cadmium): no excessive props but u can bring your own good cameras
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): says nothing about no cosplay either
Anna (Cadmium): yeah imma email them actually and wait on buying a ticket but. There's still lots of tickets open for the saturday after katsu
Anna (Cadmium): and the sunday
Jess (whoozica): hmmm theyd prob consider it part of "commercial or product shoots, media shoots"
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): that'd be a good weekend...
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Cosplay is a magical grey area between commerical and personal.
Anna (Cadmium): bill do you have any advice on how i should word it to ask if we can take cosplay pics
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): It sucks.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Do they have a phone number? I always prefer phone. If not, lemme write the Knoebels email and you can copy pasta.
Anna (Cadmium): imma ask if we can take cosplay pics and specify its all just personal use and that we think its a great opportunity to take some beautiful photos
Jess (whoozica): ~~id honestly like to go even without cosplay~~
Anna (Cadmium): if they say yes lets go cause in theory. that gives us some time to 1) mentally and 2) financially prepair
Jess (whoozica): ~~maybe even more so so im not distracted from the experience by wig and shit~~
Anna (Cadmium): $38 is a little hefty but they usually give u food or a free thing and it takes a full hour at least to get through it
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yeah, sounds fun. Need to do more in the city, I've been working there for the last year and a half.
Anna (Cadmium): ~~wear nora~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): * prints might be an issue.
Anna (Cadmium): ~~then we should email early so its considered 'advance notice' ~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Not that anyone here is doing much with prints, but sale of prints from Knoebels/Color Factory would be a use that may get you in trouble.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yeah. I'll do that email tonight, if you want that for inspiration.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I just gotta get the hella outta armonk NY <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Anna (Cadmium): pls and thanks. Otherwise imma just be super nice and careful with it
Anna (Cadmium): literally why armonk

Anna (Cadmium): LEGGO
Anna (Cadmium): i did buy a silver wig tho lmao
Anna (Cadmium): OKAY here is draft of what i wanna send out. "Hi there! 
Several of my friends and I are cosplayers, and we were wondering under what category taking photos in cosplay in the color factory would fall. I know the rules say "Tripods, excessive props, commercial or product shoots, media shoots, press interviews, and all professional video equipment are prohibited without advance approval and accompaniment from a Color Factory representative" so i'm assuming that bringing a good camera is allowed, but is taking pictures in costumes for social media something that needs advance approval? If not, would intending to make prints from photos taken at the factory create the need for advance approval?
Best,
Anna
"
Marisa (Mawisa): are the workers there hip/savvy enough to know what cosplay it
Anna (Cadmium): its new york
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): probably
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cosplay isnt a secret anymore
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nerds are "*cool*"
Anna (Cadmium): ok heres updated.

If not, would intending to make prints (to sell) from photos taken at the factory create the need for advance approval? It's an odd middleground between personal and commercial because cosplay is technically an art form and personal, but once you sell photos of your work it could be considered commercial. I just want to make sure we follow all the rules.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I usually avoid cosplay by name. Usually just keep it simple as costumes.
Anna (Cadmium): "Hi there!

Anna (Cadmium): calling them homemade makes it sound less threatening
Anna (Cadmium): Assuming we can get a yes, we go either feb 23rd or 24th, and i guess they tell us what time they can accompany us if it needs approval. 
Then we gotta figure out whos gonna be what cause i guess we probs should avoid doubles??
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Nah. The no double thing is counter to having fun.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Be who you want and enjoy yourself.
Anna (Cadmium): Valid. I retract my statement.
Anna (Cadmium): email sent (and not from my cosplay account) so ill update on response
Mark (Mad Doctor): As <@334090409389195266> will tell you, it never hurts to ask
Anna (Cadmium): Yea and its not forbidden we just have to apparently get permission. So lets hope they say yes so prints can be sold cause this would be an awesome photoshoot
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ru'dby?
