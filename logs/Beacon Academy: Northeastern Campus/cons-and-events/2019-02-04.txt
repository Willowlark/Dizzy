Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -sobs in con crunch-
Jess (whoozica): mood
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~im dabbing to hide my tears~~
Jess (whoozica): *cries in hype but also anxiety*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MOOD
Marisa (Mawisa): Is it really 10 days
oh no
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://data.whicdn.com/images/316382229/large.jpg
Marisa (Mawisa): No time to dab we gotta see
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean most of my shit is done, but i have no motivation left so its gonna be tough to get the rest done xD
Marisa (Mawisa): I still have to make the bulk of my stuff hehe
Erik (Red Riot Thot): my goal for tonight is to finish construction of my chest armor. then I have like a week to stress over painting
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh it's not done?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lol no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what else you have to do beside paint
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also good luck maris xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have to make some modifications to the back piece and add some detail, then add the shoulder straps
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and possibly modify the buckkle attachments
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ooooooooohhhh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): well it looks really good so far, did you end up doing the channeling on the back to get the shape?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the way that the piece curves around my body makes the "locking" part of the buckle useless so I can't make it tight so I gotta just glue the strap to the tightness I need and pray
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I didn't do any channeling yet. Planning on doing that after getting the rest of the shape perfected
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof, make sure to bring superglue in case of emergency
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): or hot glue
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk whats easier
Erik (Red Riot Thot): me neither lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ill bring extra buckles to katsu in case of emergency

Anna (loud and likely blonde): sandwiching ur elastic/straps between your foam and a piece of 2mm craft foam has worked wonders for me btw
Erik (Red Riot Thot): good to know
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ye its holding the strap on my chest armor (that has to be under a lot of tension) without budging
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~with liberal amounts of contact cement~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I also attached prior to painting so I don't have to worry about paint peeling up lol. Just gotta mask those bits off when I plastidip ~~if I even can because my mom's been using the garage to park her car in there~~

Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey saw a panicking mother in the restroom last year, telling her wide eyed brood "Don't make eye contact with them!". I saw another mom yank her kids away from some princess cosplayers, saying "That's not the REAL Elsa!" The kids were heartbroken
