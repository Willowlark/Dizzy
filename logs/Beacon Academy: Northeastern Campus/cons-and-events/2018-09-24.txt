Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *“Many associate the Schnee’s trademark whites with the Atlesian Snow.  Historically, the first Schnee Patriarch wore white to stand out in the black and white photography at the time. Due to the way older cameras exposed, Mr Schnee would always appear bright and clear while his competitors ended up washed out and in the dark.”*
