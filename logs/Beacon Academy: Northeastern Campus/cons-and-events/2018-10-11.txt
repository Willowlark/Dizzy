snow ( karma chameleon ): Ur mom is awesome she bought tacos when i stayed for zenkai therefore Iâ€™m forever in her debt
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD forever in her debt... oh gosh 
And <@!334090409389195266>  she said you can stay~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BLESS THANK YOU
ZombieHunter: I wanna go ;_;
ZombieHunter: Will shoot with people if my friend lets me stay with them.  Hmmmm lemme check in with them @.@
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Have you been to the expo center before Erik/Leanna?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nope
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): o3o
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It kinda looks like a lowes on google maps, so I wonder what kind of photoshoot spots it even has.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): a lowes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's basically a big ass warehouse. Zenkaikon took palce there in 2012
Mark (Mad Doctor): Never been there but driven by. The big box stores comparison is apt
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Unless it changed since there there was like the main room with main events/reg, 2 panel rooms and another room for dealers/artists lol . They blocked off the gaming room with curtains
Erik (slendergiant): Went there for Minefaire last year. It's a very generic looking Expo Center
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Sounds like Old Animenext or new CPAC.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I never attended either of those locations but yeaa it's a weird place lol
Erik (slendergiant): Probably not great for shoots
Erik (slendergiant): Honestly, the hotel in Delaware they had it in last year was nicer ~~even if it was V small~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Yea not really great for shoots but ehh prob can find some place I am sure lol~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Agreed but it's great they're expanding, though. At present, the Philadelphia area has nothing like a major con
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If it looks really warehouse like it *could* be the Nier location I've long sought after.
Erik (slendergiant): ~~There's also a family fun center across the parking lot that has go-karts and laser tag and shit~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ‘€
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LASER TAG
Rebecca (madameterralupus): When did that go in?? I don't recall that
Erik (slendergiant): ~~Which is where Joey and I ended up going when we realized Minefaire was meant for small children~~
Erik (slendergiant): https://www.arnoldsffc.com/

Erik (slendergiant): That's kind of a good idea of the convention space
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oaks is really close to Valley Forge, one of the prettiest spots in the area.
Erik (slendergiant): I'm not even sure if there are separate side rooms so I'm curious where some of the panels are going?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I'd share my Zenkai 2012 album for ya'll to see the convention space more buuuttt ya'll dont need to see tragic 1st year cosplaying me lol~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I recal there being 2 rooms by the interest and another kinda big room for dealers. Unsure if they'll split it the same though. But those rooms are built into the building. Not sectioned off lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~i can spell really well today lol. oof~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is it wrong that I see those hard floors and start thinking about cosplays with comfy shoes?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Laser tag cosplay owo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~good thing im wearing bakugo one of the days because i literally turn into him when i play laser tag~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ "DIE"~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~damn now this makes me wanna do Deku lol~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~do it~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~ehh but i hate how my current outfit looks~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~WISH I COULD GO BECAUSE I WAS GONNA DO KIRI~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~FUCK~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~cancel your other plans. Come anyways. Lol jk~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Someone's going to cosplay Luigi to do the Luigi Mario Kart meme right?
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/death-stare-VNqiJWUkv036g
Erik (slendergiant): *oh that brings me back to 2014...*
Erik (slendergiant): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03eNODCDdqY
Mark (Mad Doctor): Other fun things to do in cosplay in the area: a trampoline park and indoor skydiving
Rebecca (madameterralupus): > Goes to trampoline park
> Wig yeets off head
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): you can jump up and down in a corset right?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just thinking about that hurts XD
Erik (slendergiant): ~~Will is tempting me to go to AnimeNYC~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): When even is that again...?
Jess (whoozica): nov 16-18
Jess (whoozica): ill be there saturday!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahh. I looked at going but don't think I'd be able to afford <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Erik (slendergiant): If I did it would most likely be a Saturday day trip
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd go for a day maybe but not alone lol. Will have to see closer to

Erik (slendergiant): *~~ass bees?~~*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...youre right, SECOND most important
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~but i'll still be in nyc, so maybe i'll still see you nerds~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mmmm I was thinking I wouldnâ€™t go but maybe if I did a cheap cosplay I could
Georgia (Something Sensible): 55 dolla for one day is annoying considering all I do is go to fandom meet ups and dealers room
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): do you have to get a badge? or can you lobby con it?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Pretty sure you have to get a badge hmmm
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You need a badge yeah.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): RIP
ZombieHunter: Im going to animenyc with casey
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean they sell them there, I could get it the day of if I decide to go last minte lol
ZombieHunter: georgia come with us
Georgia (Something Sensible): Itâ€™s just that so many people I know are goING
ZombieHunter: okay but
ZombieHunter: Georgia
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Even where we had the rwby shoot last year is behind the badge wall.
ZombieHunter: my photography project
ZombieHunter: B)
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~I was gonna skip out cause itâ€™s a weekend before midterms and also that week Fallout 76 comes out~~
ZombieHunter: l o v e u s
ZombieHunter: also
ZombieHunter: it'll be the last con we do locally with casey
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Figure out ANYC after midterms Georgia.
ZombieHunter: she moves that week
Georgia (Something Sensible): FUCK I WANNA CON WITH CASEY Iâ€™ll see how I feel like the day before the con lmaooo
ZombieHunter: we're going saturday and sunday i think
Georgia (Something Sensible): If I go itâ€™ll just be Saturday
Georgia (Something Sensible): Train into the city, and train out
Erik (slendergiant): Saturday tickets are $50?
Jess (whoozica): ye
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yikes
Erik (slendergiant): Not $55
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ye they 50
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oops my bad
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think I was thinking of Katsu early bird weekend rates
ZombieHunter: 65 for the weekend
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~still expensive for what ANYC has~~
ZombieHunter: they throw most of their money into the fact that they pick out the biggest names they can afford
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah itâ€™s cause the Javits is so nice
Jess (whoozica): tom and i got our tickets last week cuz he really liked it last year
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They do mail badges if you get them in the next few days.
Erik (slendergiant): If I were to train into the the city, where would be the best place to go? ~~I don't know how trains work~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Not that the reg line was a problem last year
ZombieHunter: Penn station is walkable. 4 avenues down.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Uhhhh I take the northeast corridor train from New Brunswick to penn
Georgia (Something Sensible): *^^^
ZombieHunter: Otherwise, take the 1-2-3 to 42nd and then the 7 train to the javitz
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I think he means the train to get him to NY.
ZombieHunter: **descend into the dark underground**
ZombieHunter: oh
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You could probably come to where we're getting on Erik.
ZombieHunter: idk where he's coming from
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's off route 80, Dover.
ZombieHunter: sounds likeeee
ZombieHunter: raritan valley line?
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!386874959009415170>  if you go and take the train lemme knooowww. I may join then. Casue if i went I was gonna take the train too just don't wanna travel alone XD
ZombieHunter: anyone want to plan mini events of these types with me and casey
Erik (slendergiant): The thing for me would be is if the cost of train tickets outweighs the hassle, price, and inconvenience of parking in New York
Erik (slendergiant): Because it's looking like a round trip for 1 person is going to be $74 lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Parking in new york is a special kind of hell.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I *highly* recommend not driving in NYC.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): if you want to drive, drive to Newark/Hoboken, find parking there, take the path into the city.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What train station are you looking at leaving from? Also yea if you drive to nyc I can ask someone I knew who went there where they parked. They parked in NJ and took a bridge a cross or something?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@227431823062466569> yes.
Erik (slendergiant): Trenton
Georgia (Something Sensible): My college has free parking after 5 on Friday until 5 am Monday if you wanna park here and take the train lol
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): If anyone going to Thy Geekdom Con wants to get cosplay pictures at Valley Forge I am totally down, even though I'm not going to the con lol
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I was thinking of doing 1 day or 2 for ANYC
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Depending on my job schedule
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I tried seeing what costs were from here to nyc, yea Trenton is cheaper lol ~~but not really~~
Erik (slendergiant): Could maybe do Newark Penn to NY Penn...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You can take subways between Newark and Ny.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like look it up or do that trip..?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): What do you want to do? Drive as close as you can, then train in?
Erik (slendergiant): Basically
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Makes sense lol
Matt (mattmyers25): When my gf and I go to NYC, we take the train from Hackensack, transfer at Secaucus junction and take the train into nyc from there. I think the tickets cost us like 10 - 15 bucks round trip
Matt (mattmyers25): Not Hackensack, lyndhurst
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *Hackeysack* sorry that's what I read lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The closer you get to the city, the more parking will cost, but the less you'll have to pay for the train itself.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): IE, Dover is 3 bucks to park and 20 bucks for the train.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If you go to hoboken, you can take the path for 2.75 to 33rd street, but parking is 25+ bucks.
Matt (mattmyers25): I think once you are in Penn station, you can go out the exit for the 4,5,6 and be a few blocks from the convention center
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, Penn station is a few blocks from Javits.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Easily walkable.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Secacus was like, 30 bucks to park iirc.
Matt (mattmyers25): Lyndhurst was free
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Dover is 30 for the round trip, and aforementioned 3 for parking.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Whenever I pull up Dover it's like way over $30 XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Unless we looking at diff things
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): iv been to the dover one many times, its definitely 30
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 15 each way
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like unless we talking about a diff Dover the only one I get to come up is DE?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Dover NJ.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh no its dover nj
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Weird. I don't get that to show up XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Amtrak yea or soemthing else??
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oh no.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): you want NJ Transit.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Amtrak is hella expensive.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Only good for like, NY to DC.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahh okay ðŸ˜®
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay I figured out howmst to work the website. Newark seems fine. it's a haul from our places lol but we can do what we did for Anext. Meet up at either my place or your place and one of us drive up there to the stations lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I haven't looked at Trenton, Dover or others yet lol~~
ZombieHunter: You're welcome to park at my house and we can go to a train all together
ZombieHunter: I have double the trains from Rahway since NEC and NJC lines connect there
ZombieHunter: I live five minutes from it
Casey (Raining_Jellyfish): train friends! ðŸ™Œ
