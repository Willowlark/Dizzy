Anna (Cadmium): are you not proficient at ice skating
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I did last year.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Crappy angles for photos though.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~My uncoordinated ass is going to Kotori~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can't roller skate so I am not about to try ice skating. My body also hates me enough as it soo not about to make it worse 😂😂

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i cant ice skate either but im going and gonna try not to die
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao good luck Leanna
Anna (Cadmium): its ok. i am bringing a handler.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but im doing casual bakugo so if i fall and get mad it'll be  "in character"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): BLESS
Anna (Cadmium): and by that i mean literally my BF is making sure i dont eat shit
Anna (Cadmium): he plays hockey so he can skate LMFAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): a saint
Anna (Cadmium): which means that the collective 'we' will be helped by him as well

Anna (Cadmium): NECESSARY
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): excellent, make sure hes ready to help everyone get up
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because i can see a lot of us just falling on our asses
Anna (Cadmium): <:valid:420824413592748032>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I would constantly fall on my ass. My balance is shit. Thus is why I'm not skating LOL~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mood
Anna (Cadmium): Is ok you are valid and we love you and you can laugh at us
Anna (Cadmium): also if the rink has hockey games ever played on it, theres bound to be spots in the walls where youre actually able to put ur camera for decent shots
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Erik (Red Riot Thot): i CAN ICE SKATE WELL ENOUGH TO GET BY
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Noice! 👏🏻 gonna be fun to finally properly test my new camera out
Jess (whoozica): last year i panicked and held onto tom for 2 hrs straight
Jess (whoozica): then he would deposit me on the sidelines so he could actually skate for a little bit before picking me back up
Anna (Cadmium): Im actually pretty good at skating if i can get figure skates not hockey skates
Anna (Cadmium): Who is everyone gonna wear though i am curious. Probs bringing yang cause shes the most repaired rn
