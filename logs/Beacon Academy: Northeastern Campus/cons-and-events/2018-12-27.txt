Jess (whoozica): does anyone remember if the gaylord rooms have microwaves?
Matt (mattmyers25): I dont think so
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They don't. Only a fridge
Jess (whoozica): damn thanks tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Well a mini fridge lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And no probs! 🤗
Jess (whoozica): tom and are discussing bringing our own food this time so we are weighing options
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We did that a bit last year. But sadly with a fridge limits options lol. Most brought drinks and some snacks you can have outside a fridge lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): is there a coffee maker? coffee maker means hot water which means ramen is possible
Jess (whoozica): yea i think there is a coffee maker so oatmeal, ramen, ez mac are good
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't recall if there was or not. I feel like there was cause we used the cups for alcohol 😂
Marisa (Mawisa): coffee maker and clothes iron
pizza has been made on clothes iron before. i do not recommend.
Jess (whoozica): we might get a hotplate
Marisa (Mawisa): wow gourmet
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao I am banning making a pizza on the clothes iron in my room right now xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Jess (whoozica): i got it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): nicu
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😱 damn
Jess (whoozica): its only $1800
Marisa (Mawisa): is eating cold ravioli out of a hat allowed
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~only~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Jamie ate cold ravioli at Italian the one year lmao
Marisa (Mawisa): cold hat ravioli is my katsu tradition
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm going to make sure you eat properly.
Marisa (Mawisa): but it's hard to find forks
Marisa (Mawisa): i can use the hat as a cup and kind of drink the ravioli
Marisa (Mawisa): don't worry the ravioli is in a ziplock bag inside the hat so it's sanitary
Jess (whoozica): heaet it up with the hair dryer
Marisa (Mawisa): GOOD IDEA
Jess (whoozica): Did anyone else find the dinning options at katsu kinda crap? or did i miss something. i only ate at the own bar and grill like every night last year and their menu was pretty small
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea. We mostly ate at the Irish pub. Cause everything else was too busy or not everyone liked lol
Jess (whoozica): is that outsdie the con center?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea. I don't eat inside con center. Too over priced 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): Guys guys guys
Georgia (Something Sensible): We buy a group easybake oven
Erik (Red Riot Thot): DON'T GO TO THE IRISH PUB
Georgia (Something Sensible): Problem solved
Marisa (Mawisa): i like their sandwiches, i usually rely on those
Erik (Red Riot Thot): McDonald's was my go-to that weekend
Marisa (Mawisa): between the atrium and the dealers hall
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *valid Erik. The one nights service was high key shitty*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But that's because I was driving. It's a bit of a walk from the con center
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oooo McDonald’s is what I always get on the Sunday leaving it’s like a tradition
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Iwas gonna say you gonna walk there cause it's a haul man 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I lived off McGriddles and Buttermilk Crispy Tenders
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Adults? where?*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I was thinking my room could maybe order pizzas one or two nights~~
Marisa (Mawisa): the chicken stick things aren't too bad. i think i had those once while changing costumes.
Marisa (Mawisa): pizza takes like 3 hours to deliver
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷🏻‍♀️ the one year I got it didn't take long
Marisa (Mawisa): :0
Jess (whoozica): yea i think were gonna try to bring our own food. we dont really eat fast food or dominoes and that takes forever aynway. everywhere int he con seems really fancy and expensive or like $8 for a shitty sandwich
Marisa (Mawisa): each time we get it at katsu it's usually a long wait and we have to be like "ok. we're the people in purple and grey wigs with skirts and sweaters, no weapons. very casual."
Erik (Red Riot Thot): bring cold cuts, cheese, and a loaf of bread
Marisa (Mawisa): live like a 16th century peasant
Georgia (Something Sensible): BAGELS bagels are good
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Imma proba plan with my room packing some snacks and lunch like stuff we can all share and then maybe dinners we can go out to eat. Thus saving some money for all.
Marisa (Mawisa): snack food drawers should be common in all rooms
Jess (whoozica): think imma get that hot plate
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We've done that twice now. Jamie started the idea and it was a blessing lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hungry? Open up the magical snack drawer
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m gonna get like a dozen bagels and a brick of cream cheese
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bagels are relatively cheap, but filling, and you can buy them in bulk
Marisa (Mawisa): boil em mash em stick em in a stew
Erik (Red Riot Thot): speaking of potatoes, instant mashed potatoes would be good too
Marisa (Mawisa): we were talking about bagels
Jess (whoozica): YEA potates
Erik (Red Riot Thot): you said *boil em mash em stick em in a stew* which is a reference to PO-TAY-TOES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): To instant mashed potatoes PLZ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): from LotR
Jess (whoozica): she just foolin
Marisa (Mawisa): can also apply to bagel :3c
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://giphy.com/gifs/reactionseditor-winona-ryder-26xBI73gWquCBBCDe
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mashed bagels hm
Erik (Red Riot Thot): mashed bagel *stew*

Georgia (Something Sensible): I keep forgetting I did that but then it’s sitting in my email
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've been buying my con badges so far in advance that I forget whether or not I actually bought them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I used to do that but the past few years I've been bad and buying them like last minute... oops
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean I’d only do that for Katsu
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause that’s my fav con ~~now that the lobbyconners will be ousted~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): we'll see if that even helps.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I can’t be bothered to buy for like, anext in advance
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah 😭😭😭😭 it was so crowded last year
Georgia (Something Sensible): And the crowds seemed to be affecting most people’s moods
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea cons like anext or anyc that are last minute decision cons 🤷🏻‍♀️ eh plus idk if I'll be going to them again this year... lol
