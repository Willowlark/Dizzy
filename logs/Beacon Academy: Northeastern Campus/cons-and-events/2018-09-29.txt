Evie (Katheryne Knight): So friends I have a question. Has anyone done VIP for Katsucon, and if so, is it worth it? I'm tempted to buy that instead of the normal registration.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I thought about it, but the main benefit seems to be fast access to panels, and since I wasn't planning on doing a lot of that at Katsu, I'll save my money
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's my only thing is that Chris and I don't usually go to panels. It's more of if there is a guest we want to see I won't die in heels.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Since I'll be wearing mostly heels for the con again.
Marisa (Weeb): i think at katsu, VIP autographs are sometimes done at a different time from regular autographs.
you get a fancy badge, a special t-shirt, super quick registration line, you can enter the dealers hall early on friday (but usually everyone's not ready yet hehe), and front of the line privileges for main/big events. not all panels have VIP
Marisa (Weeb): i don't think katsu's is really worth it unless there's someone you're dying to meet
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah and Idk who the guests are this year. So I don't want to blow an extra 100 bucks
Marisa (Weeb): before i was staff i would get the vip for zenkaikon ~~also i would be the first person to register each year haha oops~~, that was kind of nice because instead of front-of-the-line, there was a reserved vip section in each main event, and they had an hour long meet and greet with all the guests.

katsu's also comes with a special vip lounge but seeing as there's 500 vip tickets it's probably a separate lounge from the guest one
Marisa (Weeb): katsu's vip badge should come with guaranteed time in the gazebo
Marisa (Weeb): u could just sit there while no one else is allowed
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah seriously
Marisa (Weeb): AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE ~~ballpit~~ GAZEBO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): PLZ
Mark (Mad Doctor): Now I wanna do a photoshoot in a ball pit
