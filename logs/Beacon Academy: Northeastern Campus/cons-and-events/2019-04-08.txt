Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I wouldnâ€™t want to work a con like that, personally. Tbh I have no idea how you and Marisa do it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But, speaking of printers at cons. I own a canon selphy 1300, V nice for 4x6 prints. I donâ€™t have the optional battery but with that you could easily yeet the thing in a bag to use at a con.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): But Hunter... there's so many of you I haven't gotten to do dungeon porn with ðŸ˜¦
Georgia (Something Sensible): Untapped porn-tential! I

Anna (blonde and sad): The funniest part of this is even tho I supplied the chains I'm in none of these softcore BDSM photos
Anna (blonde and sad): It's like 30% my fault it turned into that theme and I avoided it all lmfao
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Did someone say dungeons OwO
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~everyone is united in soft core dungeon porn apparently~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): A basic human right
