Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Marble is quality, ANYC hit me up fam.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: litty
I wanna show you guys this area upstairs ppl dont normally know about  so its super low traffic (and an incredible looking room n theres a great bar)
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Give me excuses to actually go into the city, I've been working in Fidi for two years tomorrow and I only go to a single block in the city.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Am likely to go bc daughter is in hard begging mode. Will not make call until after 1st month of school
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: *woot woot*
Bill. Once we move. Believe me I'm dragging you to more fun parts of the city. 
Or museums. Whatever comes first. 
You might like Open House NY where they open like buildings and museums n stuff for a weekend n have tours
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: And yeet I mean ticket prices go up soon ish but I'm still gonna put it off cause short on cash rn
