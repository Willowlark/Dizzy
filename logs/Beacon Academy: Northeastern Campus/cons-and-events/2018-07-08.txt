Erik (slendergiant): So I'm not familiar with Zenkai's usual date, so it was either later this year or it's really early next year. It's March 22-24
Matt (mattmyers25): It floats a lot. I Rmemeber it being in April at 1 point
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m glad it’s earlier this coming year
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That way I have time to prepare for Otakon.
Erik (slendergiant): Also, to those going to RTX, this is a thing so make sure to RSVP if you want to check it out: https://thecoop.splashthat.com/
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m slightly nervous about RTX
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like idk anxiety is a binch
Erik (slendergiant): also one of my friends is letting me stay at their hotel for Ota so I can cancel my useless hotel room!
Erik (slendergiant): They're letting me stay one night for $60... which is like a steal 😅
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I MIGHT daytrip Ota if I can
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Anxiety is definitely a binch
Erik (slendergiant): I was thinking about that at first, but they don't do single day badges so I was paying for Sunday anyway, plus I would not want to do that drive late at night
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I came back from ota last year solo, it’s a bitch.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Im more north than you tho.
Erik (slendergiant): I just don't like doing long drives at night because I have a BINCH of a time staying awake
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It was bad midday.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Otakon can wear you out.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wish I went through with booking it, even if we have a work rollout that weekend and it’s a good thing I’m not away.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Zenkai coincides with my Spring Break next year.  Which means I won't have to drive like a maniac to get there before Friday evening
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeet!
Erik (slendergiant): <@!245270932602486784> is the time of the genderbent RWBY shoot just tentative or is that definite?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I'd say tentative if only because the time for the RWBY panel hasn't been announced yet to my knowledge
Erik (slendergiant): it's 2-3
Georgia (Something Sensible): OH IT WAS??
Erik (slendergiant): https://twitter.com/RTXEvent/status/878320130656055297
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh sweet okay lemme play around with the main shoot and genderbent shoot times then
Georgia (Something Sensible): Thank you blessed Erik 🙏🙏 for alerting me
Erik (slendergiant): I'm trying to put together my schedule for RTX and saw that and was like WELP
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I think I'll bump
Georgia (Something Sensible): And the group shoot to after
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *camp camp panel panel* the best panel name XDD
Erik (slendergiant): **My friend:** *"I really only care about the Founding Father's panel. Other than that I don't know what else I want to go to."*
**Me:** *"You can come to the RWBY photoshoots my friend is hosting and see the hell that ensues!"*
**My Friend:** *"Oh God..."*
Georgia (Something Sensible): *bangs on table* HELL HELL HELL
Georgia (Something Sensible): Alright I checked with our photographer to see when he's available and then I'll have a definite time 👌 I'm probably thinking 11:30-12:30 cause then you have an hour and a half to queue for RWBY panel?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Any earlier is too early I think lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They won’t let you queue til an hour before apparently?
I want to go Friday but Idk if I’ll get in
Erik (slendergiant): sounds gewd
Erik (slendergiant): There's another RWBY panel on Sunday as well
Erik (slendergiant): Also, is the genderbent shoot different than the other Friday shoot? Or are they the same?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Different Ye
