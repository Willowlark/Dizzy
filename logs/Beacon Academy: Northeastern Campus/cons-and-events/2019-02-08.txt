Mark (Mad Doctor): Can't remember if Gaylord rooms have a decent means to create hot water for ramen cups and other instant goodies.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I think someone said that they have coffee makers? So hot water is available
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm just trying to remember if they're the sort that lets you make 8-12 oz of boiling water at a go or those stingy ones that barely burp out a shot at a time. Trying to decide if I should pack a hot pot.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I was gonna bring my water boiler if you forget yours
