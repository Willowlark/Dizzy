Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: ........the train to jersey is too complicated I'mma just drive over tomorrow loo
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You pretty much want Penn to Bloomfield.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Hnnnnnnng do I wanna deal with the PATH tho cause that's what maps says is running.


...... If I don't figure it out by noon I'm driving but otherwise bill 
Can I take you up on that pickup from the station pls
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: NY trains are having. Significant service issues rn oops
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh yikes.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!289944569410224129> you can take this route out of penn to Bloomfield station. Not sure how to get you to penn cause I donâ€™t know where youâ€™re starting from. 

The reason maps is telling you to take Path is the trains on that line all start in Hoboken today cause weekend schedules. So they want you to path to Hoboken and not have to do the 2 minute transfer. (Granted I usually avoid transfers myself but)
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): These would be the next three available return times.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Bless you
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Getting to Penn is no problem honestly so I'm set on that. What app is that <@184437198865563648>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): njtransit lol
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Soooo are we planning on going to eat after or nah? Cause if not I wanna make sure I eat beforehand so I'm not grouchy
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Idk I'm inhaling dumplings rn
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™m open to eating after.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Paranoid about not catching the right train so I'm headed to Penn already lmao
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Kk, so Iâ€™ll see you at 2:40.
ZombieHunter: <@!334090409389195266>  I was planning to eat after.
ZombieHunter: I just had lunch so after the room Iâ€™m sure I can eat.
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Okie dokie sounds like a plan
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): <@184437198865563648> idk if you ever got a wig head but if you did bring it with you I wanna give you mirio wig xD if not you can just have the head its on
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have not gotten one yet! I can replace the one you have tho!
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Sounds good to me!  No rush either ( I just wanna give it to you before he gets crushed under my CCE concrunch)
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> <@227431823062466569> me and Anna will be late by some amount cause NJT is incompetent. Stall for us! ðŸ˜˜
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Speculating 10~15 minutes late.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: So as we conclude. No matter how early I leave, I can never get to NJ on time. Ever.
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): wooo jersey! three cheers!
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Fhdhfhfj they delayed the train by a half hour
