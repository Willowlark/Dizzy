Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, first funny story of the con:
Georgia and I got a luggage cart and were trying to get it up to where the garage entrance is (not rememebering it's up a ramp but still on the same relative level) so we were waiting for an elevator to get to the second floor. There was another guy waiting for the elevator and let us go in first. As we were situating ourselves in the elevator, the guy must have gotten distracted talking to another group of people also with a luggage cart and when he turned around, the elevator door was already shutting so we just saw him go "WAIT!" and reach out to stop the door but he was too late.
So started losing our shit only to realize we needed a key card to get to the next floor but we didn't have one so we end up going to the 4th floor where someone got on and started going down who was able to get us to the second floor.
Once we got off and wheeled the cart around the corner, we realized we actually needed to be on the first floor so we started losing our shit again as we realized we just wasted that guys's tine waiting for an elevator ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So I was in regged twice. I just did a last minute check of the schedule to see if they approved he RWBY whose line panel and gave me a free badge.
