Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thinking about the Whose Relic is it anyway stuff ~~what career~~...

I'm working on scene, which need to introduce the characters, where they are, and some kind of conflict. I'm worried I'm making them too specific for people to be creative with them (I find these harder than scenes from a hat). 

```* Taiyang is cuddling with Raven, when Qrow enters. 
* Ruby and Ozpin are facing off against Salem, while Ozpin and Salem are trying to hide their unresolved sexual tension.
* Neptune is giving Jaune flirting advice when Weiss walks by.
* Raven and Summer are discussing Taiyang's punishment for wooing both of them, while Taiyang pleads his case.```

Some samples, opinions? Too restrictive? Too open ended?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```* Taiyang is cuddling with Qrow, when Raven enters. ```
Matt (mattmyers25): Nobody expects the raven
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~that's so Raven~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMAO
Matt (mattmyers25): Momma knows best
Matt (mattmyers25): Or not the momma
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Ozpin keeps on making dirty comments ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ that's how they defeat her, with embarrassment!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Given the responses, sound like good prompts.
Mark (Mad Doctor): *Ironwood and Ruby battle for the soul of Penny 2.0
Mark (Mad Doctor): *The Schnee family holiday gift exchange
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That first one is more tear inducing.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was thinking "high tech killing machine" vs. " Firefly loving sweet patootie"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~Qrow reaches Oz how to flirt~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~Tai rolls his eyes in the background as he steals all the chicks~~
