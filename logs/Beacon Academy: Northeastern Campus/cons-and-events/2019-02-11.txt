Anna (loud and likely blonde): ye but idk what cruise line they used
Anna (loud and likely blonde): o they did royal carribean too. 
maybe RC is just full of nerds
Anna (loud and likely blonde): is this the next chapter in conventions. Royal Carribean has realized that nerds are an untapped resource
Marisa (Mawisa): shoutout to the massive failure that was floatacon
Marisa (Mawisa): wasn't there also a con on a boat but it wasn't a cruise boat it was an old military boat that served as a landmark, and 90% of costumes were banned because you could only wear conservative clothing and no hats or headgear or horns or tails or bodypaint and no props and it was a mess
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Thats not a con thats a planning disaster
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig yikes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i mean at least they appear to be doing it right and hiring cruise companies that *know what they're doing*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): marisa elaborate on the failure that was floatacon i need to know details
Anna (loud and likely blonde): <@!301927856240459777> stop reading manga for a minute and spill the tea
Erik (Red Riot Thot): would love to go to Gallifrey One some day
Marisa (Mawisa): owo hewwo
Marisa (Mawisa): floatacon was supposed to be this huge luxury celebrity anime cruise
Marisa (Mawisa): https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2009-07-02/floatacon/the-first-anime-convention-on-a-cruise-ship
Marisa (Mawisa): but they didn't provide any info on guests or events so no one bought tickets because they were $1000 minimum and then they cancelled it like a month beforehand and probably went into massive debt
Anna (loud and likely blonde): R I P.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeahhhh you gotta show what youre offering before ppl are gonna sign up for a cruise
Erik (Red Riot Thot): sounds like they couldn't keep themselves afloat
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~how bad is your katsu denial im literally planning my CCE costumes~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we need the obsessive weather update cause im seeing rain for this weekend
Mark (Mad Doctor): No report. Just good mental vibes to limit the rain
Matt (mattmyers25): Hope the roof doesnt leak
Georgia (Something Sensible): gotta do our anti-rain dance
Mark (Mad Doctor): Didn't the roof over the dealers room at Ota leak two years ago?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): sounds familar.
