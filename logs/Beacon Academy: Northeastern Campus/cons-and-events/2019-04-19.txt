ZombieHunter: RUBY NO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): aside from FEAR
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that looks like a really good adam
ZombieHunter: LMFAO
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeee
ZombieHunter: He is. But also ruby no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mood
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Rubyyy D: He has been so mean to your team mate whyyy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yo quick question, does ruby even know who adam is
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ...
ZombieHunter: U h
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Not... really.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good question
ZombieHunter: Not that we know of
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I dont think so?
ZombieHunter: I feel like from our scope of the show. No
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cause if she doesnt.. adam couldve just walked up to her and been like  "HEY i know your teammates! wanna show me where they are?!"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Cause Blake is pretty unlikely to talk about him, Yang didn't know much even after she lost the arm.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and thus
ZombieHunter: But I also really doubt they didnâ€™t talk about who cut off Yangâ€™s arm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): this scenario happens
ZombieHunter: Yang had SOME idea of who Adam was to@blake@not mucchelse
ZombieHunter: Sorry Iâ€™m walking to find food
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): EAT  BOI
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I mean Yang will describe it. But Blake bolted before she explained all of those things we still don't know, like *why* he made he so afraid.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): We have the idea, just not the story.
ZombieHunter: But werenâ€™t there also the scenes of Yang glancing at Blake when she doodles?
ZombieHunter: Anime Boston is interesting I guess
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yang knew who adam was
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but ruby doesnt
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): unless she like described him in detail to ruby
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): whhich i highly doubt
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): since ruby left with jnr like right after yang was bedridden
ZombieHunter: I feel like thereâ€™s more to it. Idk.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If Blake ever did explain more about the details, rather than the general "dick, cut yang's arm off", it was prooooobably to Blake post the fight?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Cause Blake's thing was running away from difficult things.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yang knew the most about adam because of the drawing and burning the candle
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but blake never explained it to the rest of the team
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): What's the drawing?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): blake drew adam
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in her notebook
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and yang saw it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and his emblem
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): When was that?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I missed it entirely what.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): vol 1 or 2
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk they mush together for me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): before burning the candle though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so vol 2 i think
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, Yang probably knows a little and I'd guess Weiss and Ruby know next to nothing.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'm sure it will have to be explained to them vol 7
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): since they killed him
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Which could make for an interesting conversation. ~~that'll probably never happen cause now that's he's dead they're never going to talk about him again~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and are shaken up
ZombieHunter: Nope
ZombieHunter: Takes too long
ZombieHunter: I need fanfiction now
ZombieHunter: Thanks ~~Obama~~ bill
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): In the great words of Uncle Yo: "Fanfic writers get to work!"
Anna (blonde and sad): *sighs* I'll switch off erasermic and go to some yangst
