Halim (Greg): So ANYC sold out of Saturday tickets
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They sold out of everything iirc.
Halim (Greg): Nah they still have Friday and Sunday
Halim (Greg): And apparently limited availability in weeb stores in NYC for Saturday and weekend passes
Halim (Greg): And apparently limited availability in weeb stores in NYC for Saturday and weekend passes
Halim (Greg): Ngl wasnt expecting that to happen
Georgia (Something Sensible): a lot of people are migrating from NYCC to ANYC is my guess, especially cause i heard no distinct complaints about ANYC last year
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Wow I hope ANYC isnâ€™t a Katsu.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thatâ€™ll ruin my day.
Halim (Greg): ~~calls ryan to see if he can yoink me a satday ticket from one of the stores~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): anyc already has an attendance cap, whereas katsu doesnt
Halim (Greg): Katsu does have a cap, they just never reach it cause so many lobby con it
Mark (Mad Doctor): Very curious to see the effect the new policy will have on Katsu
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): A good effect.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I do not enjoy being a sardine.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Unfortunately it means no change to badge pickup... ~~however this year wasn't too bad from what I've heard about previous years~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): would be nice if they mailed them out tho
Mark (Mad Doctor): I agree, but will it be that noticable? I'm guessing there will still be significant crowds at peak hours
Georgia (Something Sensible): I donâ€™t know why they donâ€™t mail them out
Georgia (Something Sensible): RTX did it and saved SO much time
Mark (Mad Doctor): More work on the front end for them, I guess. But I'd happily pay a few dollars more for a mailed badge
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ota and ANYC mail too.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): missed the date for mailed ANYC badge ðŸ™ƒ
Jess (whoozica): Pick up was easy at ANYC last year
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeah.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's good
Jess (whoozica): And that was without mailed badges at all so wouldn't be too worried
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ota wasn't too bad either
snow ( karma chameleon ): I thought rtx mailed out badges regardless but my Canadian friend had to pick hers up, I assume most cons who mail out badges donâ€™t to out of country ppls
