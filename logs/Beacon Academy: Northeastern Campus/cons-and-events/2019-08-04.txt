Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey went to Saikoucon this weekend. I picked her up and dropped her off. Nice venue in the Poconos, but nothing to make me go "wow" as a photo location. Audrey said it was hopping on Saturday but sleepy on Friday and Sunday. She said it was a decent dealers room for a con that size. Apparently, they're looking to move it to the Kalahari next year.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Went to the bar while waiting for her. Ordered a Manhattan. Had to explain to the bartender how to make it. She charged me $9 and gave me the jumbo size. Had to walk around for a while before I was ok to drive home.
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's 2/3 bourbon
