Mark (Mad Doctor): Zenkaikon just announced that most of the lobby area will be closed off for the con, as the hotel is renovating the restaurant.  To their credit, the Zenkai staff is making other hangout space available on the upper floors, but it sucks that one of the main places for meeting people will be inaccessible.
