Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: i was finally made to watch that.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But I did order a full Kaminari hero suit cause of the coincidence so that's coo.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I realize I have to make his hair thing, was not part of the 'buy it' option.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yikes.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): a hairy lightning bolt
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i could potentially make that for you out of my blake hair scraps from yesterday
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i have like an entire second wigs worth of cut off hair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i forgot if i threw it out yet or not
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I thought it was a clip?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im pretty sure its just part of his hair?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like jirou has the soundwave
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I thought jirous was just the light
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Rebecca made a good one out of with hair with a clip you could hit her up bill
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: It's def his hair but like. Doing that on a wig is. Hard.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea thats why you do like a hairy clip
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: The hairy banana and the hairy clip
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the duality of man
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I wanted so badly to shade in the wave on jirous hair but also like. No. No I need to NOT
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: The light hitting it makes a rlly cool effect anyways
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): have you considered temporary glitter hairspray
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and a cutout template
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in like silver, or no color just sparkles
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yikes. Well. Have time for that.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I'm having ideas and idk if they're good or bad ideas
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: But 
I 
I shouldn't bc I'll never be able to wash rhis wig anyways cause somehow the marker even tho it's copic like. Rubs off and so does the ink even tho I followed all instructions
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ˜®
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): really?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats so weird
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Yea like. If I wash it with soap the color comes out. 
Water it's like ok with but
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I can dead rub my hands thru the wig a bunch and they're tinged purple
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: ....I'll show u in person lol it's so weird I can't explain it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that is really strnage, maybe its the material of the fibers
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: It's an arda wig too ;-;
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Started as a white wig not even a color. It didn't take the first dye job correctly anyways
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof, my irrational  arda hate grows xD
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Like. Bruh. It SHOULD have worked but it isn't??????
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I will say arda does have the best when it comes to weft consistency but also amt you get in a weft.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: 8' is a solid amount
Erik (Red Riot Thot): going back to the Kaminari lightning bolt, starryshyroo managed to blend it *into* the wig and it looks dope as hell ðŸ‘Œ
