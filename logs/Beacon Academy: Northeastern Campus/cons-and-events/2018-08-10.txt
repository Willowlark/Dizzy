Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YOO yes I was honestly about to sit down and do it, but if you already did one that's incredibly helpful!

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL sorry about the time!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂 all good. Thankfully swimsuits are easy to change in and out of. And I don't change my makeup for each costume. Lol

Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Soooo the RWBY cheer event was cancelled on fb without any warning. I commented again on the original post saying that I'd like to either give her help running it or just take over completely and she hasn't responded yet but like I'm mildly freaking out cause I don't know how to be a leader XD
