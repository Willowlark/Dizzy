Georgia (Something Sensible): Okay we talked about BNE doing a charity thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): I just wanted to bring it up again as the weather gets nice and people can do things
Georgia (Something Sensible): I asked about it on my most recent post and it seems like positive feedback about a charity stream so far?
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~Homestuck can town~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone said they’d pay 20 bucks for a bracelet with our signatures on it?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): lol what...
Marisa (Mawisa): That’s concerning
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 20 bucks for a signature bracelet... wtf xD
Matt (mattmyers25): Bne calendar? Or a charity stream for extra life
Matt (mattmyers25): Bne rwby calendar
Georgia (Something Sensible): I was thinking a charity stream would be cool, we could all be at my house and get like 30 minute partner/solo sections and a couple group activities like jackbox
Marisa (Mawisa): I feel like a calendar is a good idea but could get us into legal trouble
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I would honestly love to do an Extra Life stream~~
Matt (mattmyers25): I would do an overwatch stream, because why not
Matt (mattmyers25): We should do this
