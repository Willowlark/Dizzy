Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~now to go through the accounts I follow lol~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~yikes~~ I purged but didn't lose too many? I guess I block spam pornbots when they show up as a reflex
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Purged some but Insta is stupid and keeps relooping me to the top of my follower list
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 808 to 661
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My hand is cramping from tapping my phone for the last like, 40 minutes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Damn
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Went through basically every account I *don't* follow and checked how active they were. If they haven't posted anything since 2018 or really had no affiliation with cosplay, they got the boot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Part of me wants to do a SFS to get my count back up but they're so exhausting to do lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): truuu
Georgia (Something Sensible): you just gotta remind yourself that those followers were basically fake the whole time
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Truuu
Mark (Mad Doctor): I did the thing. Removed from my followers several dead accounts, inactive followers with no discernable reasons for following me, and at least six accounts that consisted of two photos of bosomy women that seem hungry for followers. I'd contend that these are the male equivalent of those garbage accounts the BNE women found among their followers.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i would say yes but we get the bosomy women and pics of just butts as well.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): spam accounts know no gender
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): just genitalia.
