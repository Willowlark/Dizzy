Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): 
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): There’s a Facebook page I found but it’s a bit empty. Does have a suggestion form.
ZombieHunter: Idk who that is
ZombieHunter: I’ve been messy anxious im@thinking about not going :/
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Aw hunter you ok? Dm me?

Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!184437198865563648> yeee!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~time to use letting you borrow one as an excuse to bring both flashes~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also. May need. Someone to shoot some Hazel. 👀 Mawisa going to too.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s. Annoying to be a photographer and cosplay.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee I can shoot anyone if need be~ and ohhh sounds intriguing! 😯
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): fun to be a photographer in cosplay unless you have many prosthetics and a cape
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Anna (blonde and sad): imma bring my camera cause imma try to leech some knowledge from yall
Anna (blonde and sad): also i think its in my car already
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'll just start ranting about light quality. I do it alot.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Me: buys backpack camera bag to carry more gear
Me: uses backpack camera bag
Bag: doesn't hold everything
Me: ...
Anna (blonde and sad): Listen y'all listen to us complain about seams and paint and worbla
Anna (blonde and sad): We can listen to you complain about light
Anna (blonde and sad): It's only fair
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): "Ya'll" You know Rebecca and Marisa are also crafters right? 😛
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was the only dedicated photographer, though Hunter seems to have dropped his cosplay recently since he's trying to go pro.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fucking hell though, I need more bag space.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd be fine if I didn't insist on bringing my grandfather's film camera everywhere... But I love it and it's like a good luck charm so no.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): someone remind me to *use* it though.
Anna (blonde and sad): Rebecca avoids sewing at all costs tho
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): we teach rebecca to rely on sewing
ZombieHunter: I also have no money to make new costumes
ZombieHunter: But I’m better at photos than I am at making stuff
Anna (blonde and sad): ~~thats why i want to make u stuffs~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao I do Anna. My sewing is called hot glue XD  I watch ya'll sew and cry at my stupidity to be able to lol
Anna (blonde and sad): the way to sewing is trial by fire
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I sewed and entire outfit once but had a friends mom standing over me the whole time. It's one of my most proud pieces lol. Never will I be able to probs do that again cause i look at the instructions and get soooo confused
Anna (blonde and sad): marisa and i can fix that
Anna (blonde and sad): also its fine i also ignore instructions and just put things together
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve spent 40 minutes. I might. Might be close to a better bag config.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So much Velcro.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): 6,514 words of notes for my panel and i kept them super brief
why can't i write this much for school
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): 1gb powerpoint presentation rip
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): HA
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s better.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i didn't even add that much more to it what happened
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I still can’t put the battery grip and two flashes in.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I kinda sorta dropped the battery grip cause of the clip system.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My camera too big for this bag damnit.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): WAIT THE FOLDER IT'S IN IS 2.3 GIGABYTES 
SERIOUSLY i thought the extra space came from the videos BUT ITS NOT
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): ask it to curl up real smal
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): can a university computer even handle this
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Girl you put more effort into this PowerPoint than I do my career.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): but i made most of it today and yesterday it's so last minute
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Again.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nor effort.
