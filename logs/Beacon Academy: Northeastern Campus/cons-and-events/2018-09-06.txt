Erik (slendergiant): ~~mostly because shoes~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): moar cosplays?
Jess (whoozica): who's all going tonight?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙌🏻 I'll be getting there with heather and David around 4pm. Basically everyone in my room should be there tonight  (including Erik, Snow, Monica, Jamie and Annette) lol
Jess (whoozica): YAAAY!
Jess (whoozica): I have jamies skirt ive had fo like 3 months to give back to her XD
Erik (slendergiant): <@!169297844874903552> are you getting like, all the key cards and just distributing them or do I have to go to the check-in desk? ~~I don't know how to hotel~~
Jess (whoozica): theres no key cards there, just wristbands
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 👆
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): no keycards, you get a wristband. You likely will need to go to check in desk to get it, and to do so without Rebecca Rebecca has to have your name on the reservation.
Erik (slendergiant): NEAT
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Each wrist band is tied to a person
Tom (tomukuncosplay): And you can make.purchases on it
Jess (whoozica): IF rebecca lats you cuz it all linked to her card
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh there's no key cards? O.o interesting....
Tom (tomukuncosplay): But the wristbands have reserved funds
Erik (slendergiant): nah I got cash and my own card
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 150 dollar hold per person, per night for room charging with the wristbands.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): But ofc you'd have to pay her back
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I should be there before everyone so just call me when get there lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cash + Hot tub = soggy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *well everyone in my room
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I brought my card into the pools last year, in a baggy. It survived, but it's a risk you run.
Erik (slendergiant): I'll most likely be using card mostly. I just still have a huge wad of fives from doing that $5 challenge last year. Meant to use it at RTX but, again, ended up using my card mostly xD
Jess (whoozica): the 150 per person hold is rough for some people tho, understandably
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol Erik you don't need to pay for your wristband. It's included with the room xD just call me when ya get to the resort lol
Erik (slendergiant): I know...
Erik (slendergiant): I'm talking about buying like...
Erik (slendergiant): anything else
Jess (whoozica): he means hes not gonna charge stuff on it
Erik (slendergiant): ^
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OHHHHH xDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sorry my mind is not with it today cause I'm running around doing last minute stuff 😂😂
Tom (tomukuncosplay): But yeah if anyone charges anything you should get it on the receipt
Jess (whoozica): you can get 4 chargeable wristbands per room i believe or just a key card wristband no charging abilities
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): any number per room.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): So you'll know 👀
