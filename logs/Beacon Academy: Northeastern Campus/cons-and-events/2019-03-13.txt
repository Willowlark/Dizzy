Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Any book would be fair game
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Amish weebs reading manga
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sean Dyke has been shit posting in the Zenkaikon2017Photo page for two days. Seems more interested in trolling than starting an honest discussion.

And I spoke with a cosplayer at Zenkai two years ago who told me about his "Amish connection." An elderly Amish neighbor helped him to sew, and her husband helped to craft props.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): <@229713389511901185>  are you doing Alter??? If so, when I redo my Jeanne we should def get pics together ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€

Anna (loud and likely blonde): dont stretch urself too thin
Mark (Mad Doctor): <@229713389511901185> Perhaps you should do Winter at Ota...
