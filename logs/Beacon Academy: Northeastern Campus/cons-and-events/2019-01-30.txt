Anna (loud and likely blonde): <@334090409389195266>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEA OK I WANNA BORROW
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THATS SO CUTE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WTF
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Here's the alternative
Anna (loud and likely blonde): But yeeee I'll bring u the jacket
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FUCK THATS LIT TOO I think the first one works better for what we doing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I FUCKING LOVE THAT GREEN ONE
Anna (loud and likely blonde): So it sounds like we need a fashion shoot in times square when its warmer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The buttoooooons
Anna (loud and likely blonde): My thrifting skills are legendary
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Both are from Goodwill
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm shook
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Rich people in Connecticut throw away amazing stuff
Mark (Mad Doctor): Today marks the day when I begin obsessively checking long range weather forecasts for Katsu weekend. Granted, this far out, I might as well consult the magic eight ball, but I can't help it. Anyhow, right now it's looking sloppy the week before. Not enough to impede travel, but unpleasant to be outside
Anna (loud and likely blonde): if i send Mag to zenkai (she wants to go to PA cons, theyre only 2 hrs from her) will yall like. be loud enough she can find u at the rwby meet. 
she is lookin for cons and lonely ~~and not going to rochester with me~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): .... weâ€™re RUNNING that shoot.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So yes.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok but. you have to realize. 
shes basically face blind
Rebecca (madameterralupus): She can also always message one of us if having trouble finding ðŸ˜ƒ
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeeeeeeeee
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The venue isn't super huge so we're not difficult to find. Especially if we just hang in the corner by the front entrance most of the day like last year lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yaaaaaaaay.
Her words not mine:  i would enter grimm blake into stuff but i dead do not know if i could walk on to a stage in her like. idk that hoe is gonna walk on flat ground much less stairs 
So youll easily find the person face planting
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Haha awwww
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *she bought a badge yes*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!301927856240459777> you don't have to do the walk in to enter right?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): For masquerade?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If you enter Saturday, you do. If you enter Friday you can decide if you do or don't.
Marisa (Mawisa): for what con?
Marisa (Mawisa): it depends
Marisa (Mawisa): walk-ons are usually wholly optional no matter what day but for katsucon they're not doing any walk-ons
Jamie (Jamie): Zenkai is like what rebecca said with Saturday competitors be a part of the masquerade and Fridays given the option
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee depeding when you show up to enter and be judged
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Speaking of which, is anyone besides me and marisa gonna try to compete at katsu?
Marisa (Mawisa): everyone come with us bring your costumes we can have a line party
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I enjoyed competing the 2 times I did but I can't sew well enough soo XD ~~Only Ryuko passes to enter and i can't wear her anymore. Woops.~~
Jamie (Jamie): Not katsu I'm waiting til I have more confidence for that stage but i think i will return to zenkais competition this year with jeanne
Jess (whoozica): dont you have to make like 100% of your costume to compete?
Jess (whoozica): if ever competed id prob start somewhere really small XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think its like 80% or something, like anything not made from scratch has to be modified in some way
Jess (whoozica): katsu be scary
Marisa (Mawisa): depends on the con, zenkai is 75%
Jess (whoozica): i think i make like 50% of my stuff on average XD
Marisa (Mawisa): it just freaks me out when the judges get touchy and i'm like "pls don't let anything break pls"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol anymore I am lazy so like only 20% is made by me... WOOPS
Jess (whoozica): like with nora i just didnt see a point in making the skirt wen i could buy a dead accurate one for $7
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I the one year at Zenkai was told by a staffer to go get judged when just walking around XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i feel you tho, it takes me forever to make things when i do them 100% from scratch so lately if i want tsomthing to roll out fast i buy parts of it xD
Jamie (Jamie): Omg yea when i entered my first yuuko at zenkai and they were like yea can we look closer at the trim edge of the train and i was just like oh shit please let it all be in one piece currently
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah for some reason we either get no one or we get swamped with entries at zenkai. No in between.
Jamie (Jamie): Then i walked on stage and my knee high fell down and i had to awlward walk to try to hide my pasty leg from popping out the dress
Jess (whoozica): cosplay is becoming resonably cheep to buy too? like buy the time i get the fabric and everything to make it i could have just bought the costume half the time
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea the year I entered Ryuko the had to cut it off. And of course they cut it off right after me and I was like ahhh noo I don't wanna be the final closer XDD
Marisa (Mawisa): I bet no one noticed shhhh
Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH thatâ€™s become my standard. If I can buy it for cheaper than it costs to make it Iâ€™ll just buy. Weâ€™re spoiled today it used to be you couldnâ€™t find any cosplay online or if you did it was like $500
Jamie (Jamie): Maybe not but trying to walk and not show that leg with the dropped sock while I had a foot of dragging dress and was wearing 5 inch heels was not fun
Marisa (Mawisa): Thereâ€™s a really good write up someone made about the evolution of cosplay availability in the last 20 years
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the one thing i dont like about katsus contest is that it cant be an original design of a character
Marisa (Mawisa): I think thatâ€™s to prevent people from just drawing what theyâ€™re good at sewing and creating an elaborate character around their strengths
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean yea, but isnt the point of the contest to ..show off your strengths XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it's probably to be easier to judge based on accuracy, with no bias toward just redrawing something to look exactly like what you made
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i was still sad xD
Marisa (Mawisa): They like seeing challenges and people trying new things too~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i wung an entire leather armor~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~never worked with leather before~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i dont like the katsu rule either like it limits you a lot~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its ok though, now i can enter penny, and enter harley in a dif contest xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The only time I recall winning (2nd) a costume contest was at some dinky ass college con and they had only one entry so they asked me to enter even though I had bought my costume XD
~~That was awkward too cause I was competing against my biggest enemy at the time lol~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OOF
Mark (Mad Doctor): Was looking to do leather for Aragorn one day. It ain't cheap. Materials for his badass duster would cost $300+
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaa harley is my most expensive cosplay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): leather is hella expensive
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and on top of that if you dont already have the tools, those arent cheap either
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but it was a lot of fun to do
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~ <@!386624706612297729>  probs know who I am talking about.... ðŸ˜¬ ~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i love learning new things
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~it also took me like 8 months to make because of the learning curve, but... it cool AF~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Does anyone know any good tips for competing aside from â€˜make better costumesâ€™. I feel I always freeze and forget to talk about the most important things.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof a mood
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): start from top to bottom or vice versa when explaining your costume
Marisa (Mawisa): Ye I do that itâ€™s a good idea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): bring more than one reference photo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and also progress photos if you have any
Marisa (Mawisa): six years in and Iâ€™m still freezing lol
Ive always brought a ton of references but sometimes itâ€™s too many so Iâ€™m gonna cut back
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): try not to explain any one thing too much, keep everything with about the same level of explanation otherwise you will run out of time XD that happens to me a lot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i get overly excited about one part and talk too long about it
Marisa (Mawisa): ooo i should keep that in mind yeah. i talk about everything equally. :0 thank!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You need an impact piece more than anything. I've only seen two competitions, but judges care about 'oh my god HOW kind of large, stand out work' or things they personally connect to.
Marisa (Mawisa): once i walked in and they were so busy watching the anime i was dressed as in preparation for me they didn't even notice i had entered lol
Marisa (Mawisa): the personal connection thing is true but I think it can also apply to techniques. usually each judge has a specialty and they'll pick judge prizes based on their speciality, like armor or trim or bedazzling or whatever
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i think its impact piece and then after initial shock, like dexterity of materials
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they also seem to really like if you use a lot of different materials
Marisa (Mawisa): i wanna keep improving my sewing skills because that's probably the main point. i've been on both ends of the competition (entrant and staff/judge aid) and it's crazy how much effort both sides put into it. people make amazing things for their costume it's crazy.
Marisa (Mawisa): 800 hours of beads crazy
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like i got judges who were impressed at the sheer amount of sequins you hand sewed on instead of buying fabric with sequins in it
and then theres ones who are impressed with seams, or how you manage to gravity defy stuffs (like my pyro boot tops are actually on the pants not the boots
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i feel that on a spiritual level~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i think it boils down to passion
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and how much of ur soul you put into it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): time to get the blood magic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^i second that
Jess (whoozica): yea definitely
Marisa (Mawisa): yeah it's a lot of factors combined into one. they have categories and then each judge has their specialty
Marisa (Mawisa): judges will also step out if they're friends with any of the entrants to keep it fair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): often your passion comes out in the quality of work, or how much work you put in and it shows
Marisa (Mawisa): it's a bit sad though too when entrants have a costume malfunction and need help, but it happens **a lot**. i spent more time helping one girl fix her costume before judging than actually working at a con once. the cosplay repair room is usually packed just before a masquerade. it's so good we have them now.
Marisa (Mawisa): lifesavers
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~a grenade fell off my costume right before i went to host a panel so i pulled out the hot glue gun, fixed it, and kept talking~~
Marisa (Mawisa): ***a grenade***
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *have u never seen tf2 characters*
Marisa (Mawisa): casually glues grenade back on belt
Marisa (Mawisa): at animenext there was a girl who casually took her pants off backstage and sewed a button back on in the dark pantsless
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Skills lol
Marisa (Mawisa): "hey u guys is it ok if i take my pants off"
"....???????"
"a button fell off"
"OH yeah go for it"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): shame does not exist when is repair time
Anna (loud and likely blonde): <@!301927856240459777>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): just. imagine me walking around as this and. until i take off the mask everyone assumes its a guy and therye like OH /
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Did you mumble the whole time too.
Marisa (Mawisa): how many hats did you have
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i did. i can do the voice very well. 
i had actually zero hats i did just stock pyro
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that costume is legit so sweaty and difficult to wear that idk if i can add hats
Marisa (Mawisa): <@!334090409389195266> look we're on the kogaracon site!!
Marisa (Mawisa): a new crowning achievement in my life. time to add this to my resume.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): SUCH FAME
Marisa (Mawisa): sorry if u wanna talk to me now you have to contact my agent
