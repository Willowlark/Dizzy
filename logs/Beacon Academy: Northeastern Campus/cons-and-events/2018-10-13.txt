Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I was thinking of day tripping it for saturday
ZombieHunter: could shoot with meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ZombieHunter: i'll even have my full studio with me~
ZombieHunter: ~~seduces with photography~~
Erik (slendergiant): Another one of those illogical price breaks...
Erik (slendergiant): Two half hour sessions please
Georgia (Something Sensible): Itâ€™s cheaper to book two thirty minute wtf
Erik (slendergiant): Exactly. This is at least the third photographer I've seen whose rates make no sense
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Erik likes calling them out.
ZombieHunter: Iâ€™m shooting $30 for 30 or what I call photographer satisfaction
ZombieHunter: Jesus
Erik (slendergiant): ~~price per unit is supposed to decrease as quantity increases~~
ZombieHunter: I keep going until I think Iâ€™m happy with what I have
ZombieHunter: It works well for me. :3
Erik (slendergiant): Do what works best! I just am really tempted to inquire about doing two back-to-back 30 minute sessions to save $5 and see if they realize their blunder
ZombieHunter: Lmfao
ZombieHunter: Iâ€™ve been SUPER happy with my content tbh
ZombieHunter: <@!184437198865563648>  whatâ€™s your opinion on mirrorless or not
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Haven't really looked at mirrorless. I don't feel the need for a smaller body though, I've got big hands so using a DSLR isn't a problem for me.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I also don't trust digital displays; images can look completely different by just change the display brightness.
