Marisa (Mawisa): the county-wide newsletter we got recently says the local gazebo can be rented for $30 per 2 hours. it's next to a park (which is mostly a big swath of empty grassy space), a police department, a little memorial with some flowers, and a big children's playground.
Marisa (Mawisa): big gazebo
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): !!!!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): you got address? I wanna google maps street view it.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I get emails from Kalahari... even for wednesdays in January they want 199/night.
Jess (whoozica): Yeet
Jess (whoozica): Alot of people go this time of year to get away from the cold and blah
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol let's go to get away from the cold faamm
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have been batting with the idea of spending a weekend there tbh. Spa, hot tub, booze...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): good way to spend it.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@289944569410224129> if you want I can see if Chris is willing to let you borrow his!
Anna (Cadmium): pls do i need to slowly drag this boy into cosplay
Evie (Katheryne Knight): When I get home I'll ask him!
Mark (Mad Doctor): We went in January last year when temperatures were in single digits. The outdoor hot tubs were a blast
Anna (Cadmium): Hi Anna, 

That is correct. We do ask that nothing interfere with the experience of the other guests, so clothing must be appropriate. Could you share a little more info about what sort of costumes you would be wearing? Thanks!

xo,
Sarah
Anna (Cadmium): got a response! someone help me write an explanation other than "mostly normal street clothes with colored wigs"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): so they're what, okay with it without printing?
Anna (Cadmium): yes
Anna (Cadmium): so we can plaster it on everything as long as we dont sell em
Anna (Cadmium): i assume this means it could go in a portfolio or printed for personal gratification as long as we dont sell it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yup. No print shop.
Mark (Mad Doctor): There is a gazebo right next to the Japanese House in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park (where they host Sakura Sunday) that is free for public use. I've encountered cosplayers shooting there
Anna (Cadmium): <@!184437198865563648> im asking if we have to get clearance or if we'd have any issue with you bringing in your camera and lenses etc. not cause its 'commercial equipment' but bc idk who would be at the door accepting tickets
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's in new york, I doubt anyone will want to bring standing equipment. So it really just needs approval for DSLR cameras.
Anna (Cadmium): ye but still with our luck we'd find the one dumb employee
Anna (Cadmium): well my luck
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): mines worse.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But.
Anna (Cadmium): ~~did your dorm building catch fire and displace you for a month~~
~~did your dishwasher catch fire~~
~~did your fridge try to set your apartment on fire~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): For equipment just list DSLR cameras. no need for tripods/standing lights/reflectors indoors. Especially if there are guests, they'll never let us do that.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~your fridge did what now~~
Anna (Cadmium): yea like a handheld light is way different
Anna (Cadmium): the fridge lightbulb started melting plastic and almost caused a fire in our apartment
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): flashes are small and we can judge on the spot if we can use them.
Anna (Cadmium): oki someone edit for me.
Anna (Cadmium): Hi Sarah,
Awesome, glad we're both on the same page now. Would our photographer have any issues bringing in his DSLR camera? It's not a huge rig or anything, but he would have a camera backpack and some extra lenses.
The types of costumes we would be wearing would be essentially normal, some possibly heavily decorated with patches, one person might wear a tiara type headpiece, but otherwise normal 'fashion' or street clothes. There wouldn't be any nudity or inappropriately exposed skin, and everyone would be wearing appropriate footwear. We would all be wearing colored wigs as well, wanting to fit into the 'color' theme of color factory.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): sounds about right... Kinda hard to describe 'costumes'.
Anna (Cadmium): i mean i understand her questioning like are we bringing bourdoir or like normal clothes. also like. are we showing up in a full suit of armor
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeah. I'd hope they don't assume boudoir lol. Armor... Eh. It wouldn't fit in the setting, and traveling with it would suck.
Anna (Cadmium): lol i mean. they could be assuming fursuits
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): o-o-o-o-oooFFF
Marisa (Mawisa): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Mark (Mad Doctor): Who wouldn't? 
When I was dealing with CH College, I sent a few sample pictures to give them a ballpark idea of what to expect
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ^ that's how i'd lean. Grab a group shot.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): BNE at Zenkai last year may be a good one.
Anna (Cadmium): rip i sent already if she wants a pic i'll grab some casual stuff off insta or back in photo dump
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~don't grab the dungeon porn~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~sadly everyone is decent in those photos~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~whose filling a bathtub with these at Katsu~~
Jess (whoozica): i thought this was corn at first
Marisa (Mawisa): Lewd jasper photoshoot
Jess (whoozica): corn tub for Corin <@!301927856240459777>
Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think cheese powder counts as body paint
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'll do it
Anna (Cadmium): if i see a news article treating us like homestucks for this
Anna (Cadmium): Hi Anna,

DSLR cameras are fine, and those costumes sound like they would be fine as well! Again, we just ask that you be respectful of other guests and not hinder their experience. From what you've said, it sounds like you should be all in the clear, but if our staff notices any issues, they can let you know. Thank you so much for taking the time to check!

xo,
Sarah

<:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>  
We in the clear
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Did you ask if they wanted us to come a specific time?
Anna (Cadmium): They want a specific time if its for the 'paid' shoot but otherwise its fine for us to go on saturday normal times
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): kk.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That'd be it then.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Yeet
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): HAHA. That's on the official marriott page.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good on them
Anna (Cadmium): did they get a citation from the fire marshall or something
Matt (mattmyers25): I'm thinking for security and crowd control
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's because of the con goer only rule.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The con blocked off the hotel, not just the convention center.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Zenkai does this too.
