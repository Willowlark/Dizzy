Anna (Cadmium): How does the ball work exactly this is my first katsucon
Anna (Cadmium): Also like how is this my first katsucon.
Anna (Cadmium): How have I never done katsu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it sounds fancier than it is, its basically like a high school dance and people dance like idiots around the side and people who actually know how to dance go on the dance floor
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theres ballroom dancing lessons if youre so inclined
Anna (Cadmium): So it's not like cce where you have to be in specific dress code?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): there is a dress code
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You have to be in formal attire
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.katsucon.org/events/formal-ball/
Anna (Cadmium): So it is like cce then 
Ok maybe I'll pull out a dress and the yang wig idk
Anna (Cadmium): Wait my dress is white I'll still just be a kodama
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye! last year i did yangs dress from the show and it was fine
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i thought i might have issues because it was backless and short but they didnt care so
Jess (whoozica): i was gonna do my yukkata 2b thingy bu thats really short so im just gonna wear my wedding dress cuz no one can tell me thats not formal enough
Anna (Cadmium): Uh. 
What happened that they have a note saying please don't wear something where the jaws of life might have to be used to get you out
Anna (Cadmium): hhhh idk my dress is short and doesn't have straps but like. So much wig maybe doesn't matter
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): prob corsets
Anna (Cadmium): How does a corset need jaws of life like those are what pull your car door off in an accident when u can't get out
Anna (Cadmium): Who welded themselves a corset
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cosplayers are insane, i wouldnt be surprised
Anna (Cadmium): I'm high-key judging anyone who made themselves a metal corset
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ‘€
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -slides welding machine and corset supplies under bed-
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): y-yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok but like could you imagine.... the fucking CHAFING
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I would want to follow them around and stick magnets to them
Anna (Cadmium): I barely survied in a bathing suit with chafing can u imagine
Anna (Cadmium): Oh. Maybe. Maybe they mean full suits of armor
Matt (mattmyers25): Rip
Anna (Cadmium): Like. Medieval armor
Anna (Cadmium): That would make sense
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~Alphonse Elric~~
Anna (Cadmium): I did actually think of that
Anna (Cadmium): What day of the con is the ball I can't find it
