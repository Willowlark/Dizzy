snow ( karma chameleon ): Yes
Matt (mattmyers25): Not really since I work the next day
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): it depends on if we're doing our $3 burrito thing because if not I can probably get off work
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): but if you wanna celebrate it a day or two early/late then I would have a much better chance of getting off
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): actually nevermind I only work mornings on Wednesdays but our teacher is doing a video lecture so we can have our fun but work doesn't know that 😏
Marisa (Weeb): zenkai is starting to go through the new staff applications and is accepting in waves
still accepting if anyone wants to go to the con but not pay for a badge and accommodation

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hehe. Only 4 people are going to the pumpkin konkon shoot.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 25$ is too much for the spook
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Indeed.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm I wanna go cause seems neat and my one friend asked if I'm going but I need to save money so .~. Also seems a bit much just for a pumpkin patch thingy in my opinion
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Since you like to poke fun at these Erik; I scrolled past it thinking it was a newbie photographer setting rates. Then I saw the return amount; yikes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Black and white as a stipulation, 2 for 15? That's not competitive at all.
