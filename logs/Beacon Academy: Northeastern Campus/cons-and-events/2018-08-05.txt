Jess (whoozica): Whoo!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Hmmmmmmmmmm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Guys do I stand foam before or after priming it?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Sand*
Jess (whoozica): Sand, then prime
Mark (Mad Doctor): I did it the other way by mistake. PlastiDip does not take well to sanding
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Thank you!
Jess (whoozica): I guess it could depend on what exactly you are doing? Like of you are using a bumpy kind of primer then you wanna sand after

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!386567060026556417> the big windows you were talking about were the balcony windows like these?

Also iirc we only can use the interior from 2 to 4 or something like that right?
Matt (mattmyers25): Did we determine a price for it?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Depends on how many people are coming.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~manually moves Jess and Tom to going because I know them~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's  right, Bill.  It was better lit than it appears here. I was there around 1:30

The total price was $250. One people are back from RTX, I was going to call for a final count so we can establish price per person
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): mmkay. Thinking about tossing light equipment in the car. I don't use it much but no time like the ~~present~~ future. Also trying to think ahead of what we want to do indoors if there's a limited time frame, to make sure we can do it all.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Additionally I'm trying to see what I need to make use of the old cameras at Chestnut hill. Namely, the cameras that need CF memory need new cards. If no one wants to make use of those cameras at the shoot, I'm not going to worry about getting them. @everyone , chime in if you're interested in using one of the cameras to be a photographer for a change.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me!!
Matt (mattmyers25): <@169297844874903552>
