Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So for the shoot, <@!334090409389195266> and <@!245270932602486784> you want to freezerburn it up? Also Leanna we've got a Neo coming, I figure a good ice breaker (I think she only know Georgia and I) would be some baked alaska.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YES
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!387456543421104150> <@!169297844874903552> I've missed you guys at way too many cons, I'mma be sure to get you for a bit. Rebecca you're doing Raven iirc, Monica are you doing new Salem or is that at CCE?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👌🏻 sounds like a plan my man.
Georgia (Something Sensible): WOO FREEZERBURN IT UPPP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Once we know when we're starting I'mma roughly plan.
Matt (mattmyers25): Do I bring my rocket launcher with me? Hmmm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OH you doin Junior. Guess Leanna going to have to punch you in the face.
Matt (mattmyers25): Yes I am. But first, I need to grab her hair
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'll bring the lighter~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and we need more Schnee family photos, sheesh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's going to be busy.
Matt (mattmyers25): Start making your list
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm beinging my camera too <@!184437198865563648> so if anyone has photo requests that you can't get too I can try to take them 🤗
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I will bring you a weft of yangs hair, matt
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yea, and I'll have the DSLRs I was talking about as well.
Matt (mattmyers25): Please don't hit me too hard <@334090409389195266>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Please do <@!334090409389195266> ^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So we'll have plenty of cameras lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): No promises, after that vol 5 punch that sent that guy boucing
Matt (mattmyers25): Not my fault if something breaks XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *If she breaks your face it'll definitely be her fault*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 🤷
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): <@184437198865563648>  I'm doing official Salem at Chestnut Hill and swimsuit Salem at cce
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): ALSO would it be possible for me to borrow one of your cameras for a day at cce?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't intend to pack them all for the con. It's a lot to keep track of.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!387456543421104150> I have an extra camera I can bring along for you to borrow if you'd like.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 👀👀👀
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Yes please 👌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I will make a note to pack it lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just heard back from Chestnut Hill College. The interior space is a pretty hard 2-4 time slot apparently, but I think they will be accommodating if we do exterior shots before then. I'd think they would want to know when we'd show up so they could alert security. Should I tell them 12:00? 1:00?
Georgia (Something Sensible): What's weather looking like?
Georgia (Something Sensible): That's probably a factor
Georgia (Something Sensible): 85 and sunny according to my phone
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Definitely would say noon.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 2 hours is a surprisingly short amount of time when shooting privately.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Trueeee facts
Erik (slendergiant): http://rwbymotivation.tumblr.com/post/177203902691/yaboitomcat-here-are-some-rtx-pictures-if-you
Erik (slendergiant): There's a pic of Mak (sp?) in case anyone wants to forward this on to her
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858> , though Hal on a plane.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She has an instagram now, hollyjollymak iirc.
Georgia (Something Sensible): on ittt
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Oh lol
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): She should be in here
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): She be invited now
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Also I got this
HollyJollyMak: Hello!
Georgia (Something Sensible): hewwo!
Erik (slendergiant): henlo!
Jess (whoozica): HI MAK!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh hi Mak.
HollyJollyMak: Hi! Yoooo I know all these people!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that you do.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): HEWWO
Tom (tomukuncosplay): RIGHT?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): color applied, usin Vernal since she the shiny new cosplay.
HollyJollyMak: Ah, thank you!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Update from Chestnut Hill College: because of how they organize personnel on Sunday, they're willing to let us on campus no earlier than 1:00. We'll need to check in with security when we arrive and at 2:00 we can move inside
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): can we stay after 4pm? Or is going to be a hard 1-4?
Georgia (Something Sensible): the facebook event says 12 so we should probably update that too
Georgia (Something Sensible): theres some people on the event that arent in discord
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yup.
Georgia (Something Sensible): so 1-2 outdoors, 2-4 indoors, 4-5 outdoors is the impression im getting
Georgia (Something Sensible): then a cookout at the park next door?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sounds like a plan. There are some nice old time stables at the park that might make for good photos, too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sounds good to me. Imma deff make sure to bring a change of clothes if we are picnic-omg cause Oof raven is too damn warm to wear praise this time of year 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats what casual outfits are for tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): i may do the same for weiss
Georgia (Something Sensible): we have indoor space to change, and if not id offer my car cause it has tinted windows lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ANYC is going to have Vic.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😯
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~This con needs to be longer~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> <@!155492347122155520> <@!245270932602486784> <@!386567060026556417> <@!170686358535274497> <@!169297844874903552> <@!387456543421104150> <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Part of me wants to drop to 15 minutes increments, but I know that's not going to work.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol whatever your comfortable with. You'll figure it out 🤗
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also, is Bill can't fit it into his schedule would someone be willing to take pics of me as Raven with Leanna and Erik some? Gotta get them fam pics 👌🏻
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We can wrap that all into the Raven spot. 👌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Should be fine.
Mark (Mad Doctor): 20 minute blocks?
Erik (slendergiant): make sure everyone has poses in mind beforehand lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 30.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ,... Maybe I shouldn't bother with scheduling it so much and just try and hit everything on the list...
Georgia (Something Sensible): the schedule helps with so many people
Georgia (Something Sensible): tho the V5 finale im wondering may take longer than 39
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Here's the catch to that, indoor lighting and wide angle shots are a bad combo.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Honestly you can do everyone else first and get however much time you need with them and use the rest for me whether it's 5 minutes or 15
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I dunno how much we'll be able to pull off.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): We still have cce
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I expect it'll be better to do sections of the finale, such as Weiss getting stabbed.
Erik (slendergiant): Georgia just likes getting killed by Ginny
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Among other things.
