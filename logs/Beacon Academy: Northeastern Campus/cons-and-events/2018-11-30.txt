Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Zenkai panel applications are due tomorrow...
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm in. Would you like to apply, or should I?
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!386567060026556417> I suppose whats the worst that could happen?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Will this be an all ages show? Is cussing allowed without an 18+ designation
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!301927856240459777> inform us, you staff Zenkai
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): If a panel is accepted, two of the presenters get free badges. I think that second should go to you Mark, since you jumped on the idea when I threw it out.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): needs the standard personal information for the form though, address, phone, email.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Honestly, I'd be happy if someone else in BNE  got it. While I ain't rich by any measure, the cost of a con badge is no big deal to me, and I know some of y'all are just starting out
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): They have to be a "active presenter" in the panel.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~and Marisa would kill me if I encourage rule breaking at her con~~
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): DIzzy, timecheck
Dizzy: It's currently 16:01 in EST and 06:01 in Weebland.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Dizzy, timecheck
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Little early for Marisa.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~also going to put Marisa down as an additional presenter because the approval people may put it through knowing Marisa~~
