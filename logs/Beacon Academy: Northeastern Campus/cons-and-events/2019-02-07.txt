I just need to attach minor things but can always do at con too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh I have to restyle wigs too but I'll probably only do Goro at home since that's the first one I'm wearing. I'll do the rest at the hotel
Jess (whoozica): all my wigs pretty much just get style on my head day of
Georgia (Something Sensible): Saaame
Georgia (Something Sensible): If got 2 b can’t do it in the hotel room, then for me, it was never meant 2 b
Jess (whoozica): yea pretty much
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Most wigs I have don't need style or are done but I gotta cut Matt's wig and don't wanna deal with that at the con xD making a mess I can't clean up too well
Mark (Mad Doctor): Here's your Obsessive Old Guy Katsu Weather Report , D-Day-7 edition:
Accuweather says seasonable and cloudy all weekend, with a chance of a stray shower.  
Weather.com makes the weekend look far  less settled, with 1-3 inches of snow possible Friday night!
Seriously, though, they are changing the outlook every hour or so. So it's anyone's guess.
Jess (whoozica): yea ive started looking too now thats its coming within the 10 day range im getting 40 degrees with clouds, and snow saturday so who knows
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is what mine's showing
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just glad that travel weather is looking better now.  Meanwhile, Philadelphia might get 2-6" of snow while we're down there. i anticipate hearing about the joys of shoveling form my wife...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but yeah, honestly as long as travel days are looking good, I'll be happy
Jess (whoozica): small craft? nah this is katsu we got BIG crafts
Jess (whoozica): opps i was checking my location not down there
Jess (whoozica): mines the same as your erik XD
Jess (whoozica): temps seem pretty good! rain and snoe plz stay away 🙏
Marisa (Mawisa): Small craft advisory 
Is it gonna be raining airplanes
Mark (Mad Doctor): The worst precipitation outlooks are saying "scattered showers/snow" which means there should be plenty of occasions to move outside.  And snow photos at night sound fun
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Snowtos*, if you will
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Matt (mattmyers25): Perfect weather for a snowbird shoot
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Snowbirds don't need the weather to get wet*

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Did someone say Snowbirds OwO
Matt (mattmyers25): Ya
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
O w O

Anna (loud and likely blonde): I swear there's a bad joke about Eskimo twins  and snowbird somewhere and just wait till someone accidentally sets that up
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): See that just makes me think of old people running away to Florida
Mark (Mad Doctor): Shit's getting real
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh fuck that's a smart idea
Mark (Mad Doctor): Mainly a nudge to Audrey to get her plans together, and to make sure we have time to eat and change.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): what is this *"eat"* of which you speak?
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's my rule: one decent meal and one shower each day.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): apparently the VA for Hiro from darlifra is going to toracon
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~should i watch it at this point~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’d say no but unpopular opinion.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I found it entertaining. It has its good and bad moments. A lot of the characters are pretty good and deals with a lot of issues that adolescents face
Erik (Red Riot Thot): e.g. love, sex, sexual orientation, eating disorders, etc...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Aliens
Anna (loud and likely blonde): eh i think i'd pass on it then.
Marisa (Mawisa): rooms available at the gaylord if anyone wants to relocate hotels
