Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): Hey <@169297844874903552> didn't you say there was a way for to lay for more time at the water park after hours for CCE? Buddy of mine is going for the first time and I told him about it but didn't know what time it was good for and how much extra it is
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol it happens xD
And after hours is a thing the con does for us through the resort. They booked the water park more hours after it closes to normal public You pay extra with con badge by registration. It's fri/sat night 10:30pm - 2:30am
