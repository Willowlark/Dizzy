Georgia (Something Sensible): ZENKAI FEEDBACK SURVEY YALL
Georgia (Something Sensible): ASK FOR A ROOM DEDICATED TO FANDOM MEET UPS
Georgia (Something Sensible): _we barely pulled off the rwby shoot this year cause of it_
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~i filled it out for mag cause she aint gonna get the survey lmao~~
Matt (mattmyers25): Dont get to say please have the con in april/may
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yes XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good idea, Georgia. I think hosting a online community for people to schedule groups might help spread them out more. It doesn't even have to be official. Just get gruops planning shoots talking to each other more directly
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah
Georgia (Something Sensible): and with weather, there should be a place set aside indoors
Matt (mattmyers25): The problem with zenkai is that there are no official photoshoot spots like katsu. The building is too small. Hopefully the expansion helps out with that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Doubtful since its to the hotel not the con center part
Georgia (Something Sensible): or they just arent using the full possible space maybe
Georgia (Something Sensible): but theyll also have an expansion in time for next year
Matt (mattmyers25): I thought they filled out the whole building every year
Georgia (Something Sensible): i imagine they have some space squirreled away somewhere
Matt (mattmyers25): True. Though having the restaurant in the lobby didn't help
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *what does "gofer" mean?*
Georgia (Something Sensible): like a staff i think
Georgia (Something Sensible): but an intern
Georgia (Something Sensible): JAEHEE basically
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ooOOOo
Marisa (Mawisa): Yee gofers are volunteers who arenâ€™t staff. They decide how many hours they work and in return there are tiers theyâ€™re rewarded with, like a free t shirt or badge reimbursement
Anna (Blonde Banshee): wait thats how you spell it i dead thought they were just referred to as Gophers
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah!! <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> 
Because we ask â€˜em to go fer stuff we donâ€™t have time to get. Theyâ€™re errand runners :3c
Georgia (Something Sensible): this is the first time ive had way too many bloopers for a con vlog lmao
