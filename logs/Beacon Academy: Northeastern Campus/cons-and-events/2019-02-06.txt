Marisa (Mawisa): imo a good bar crawl is one where everybody army crawls in a direction away from the majority of bars and into a cushion fort stocked with chinese finger traps
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's... actually pretty perfect, since all the bars are few blocks from hoboken train station. Can sober up on the train ride back.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though I can't recall if there's direct lines to Hoboken on the weekends.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh sounds fun
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh yeah there aren't direct lines and the transfers suck balls.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay):

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): my only reason for going would be to meet the nier VAs
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *host a panel on consent in cosplay*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i dont wanna feel obligated to stay the ENTIRE weekend again
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): my panel this past year was atrocious, i was SMASHED and luckily it was all BNE attendees
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and we watched the new rwby episode that week
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *wait is this the thygeekdom con on may 24-26th?*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmmm. True. Also it wasn't cheap to get in... alsondidnt you have to lay for your room yourself? They only gave you badge and table?

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i had a bunch
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but .... ADD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol the con was a shit show. There was like nothing to really do and it was just 1 big room. Also when they shut down the dealers it was like.... even less to do xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaaaaa
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we went to the mall
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lmfao theres gotta be better cons that weekend
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The best moment
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i need a birthday con guysssss~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd say pass. It'd be a waste of money for the room and gas... didn't you even sell any prints?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Did like anyone but us visit your table? 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk i wasnt there
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Geekdom con sucked, I tried all weekend to meet lipstick giraffe and I never saw her.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): dont go. maybe you can respond saying no thanks with why you dont wanna go back?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee the con itself was lame. Friends made it great.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And bill that's a lie! You got your arm signed by her! Remember?!
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lip geoff?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m getting my comedy routines confused.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~wasted signatures. Not eligible. ~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If anything, push back with some crazy demands. Free badges for all of BNE, private area to setup our own shoots....
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Be like I'm a part of a group. We all need to come xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's only like... *30* people. Not that much xD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like actually leanna kinda want to see what they would say
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like. "yes my group would come"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *we can do smack a schnee*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): “You can only invite me as part of Beacon Northeast”
“I’m uncomfortable attending your con alone since I was followed multiple times by creepy guys with skin conditions and tools with postit notes, I’ll need my friends to come”
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, not likely you’ll care if they say “no we’re not inviting you anymore”.
Marisa (Mawisa): We could rent a dunk tank
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): guys, that all involves ...having to be there for 3 full days
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and painting until cleanup to leave
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IDK IF ITS WORTH EVEN THAT
Marisa (Mawisa): Let’s do it
Marisa (Mawisa): Did they pay you and give you free accommodations and transportation? You were a guest right?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they only gave me a table and free ticket
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa they didn't give her much.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): if its a smaller con i mean thats a good deal but like if they got money then thats bull
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And you had a panel too that ya had to prepare for last minute right?
Marisa (Mawisa): Ask for accommodation that’s like the bare minimum they should provide for guests
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we could do. sat sun and have smack a schnee. ill be shitley
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omggg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "so my friends want to guest, but i don't"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -slides a penny and 3 tickets to laser tag across the table-
Anna (loud and likely blonde): -pyrrha slides back four quarters-
Marisa (Mawisa): omg guest and press are the only badge types I haven’t obtained through proper methods. I have every other type of convention badge. I do have a few guest badges but they were either VIP or obtained after the con ended. Someone help me obtain a guest badge someday and a press badge someday and I’ll split half of my wish with you because everyone knows if you get con badge bingo u get a wish
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i have never heard of this bingo
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i did a panel but somehow got an artist badge idk how
Marisa (Mawisa): I have medical, staff, volunteer, artist, dealer, panelist, all badges except guest (I technically have it but not through proper channels) and press
Marisa (Mawisa): Because ur art
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn Marisa xD that's a lot of badge types
Marisa (Mawisa): gotta catch em all
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we just. gotta write a bne blog
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and ask for a press pass
Marisa (Mawisa): 10 years of badges and I need more
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Marisa (Mawisa): Y E A H
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how did you get MEDICAL
Anna (loud and likely blonde): what can u do
Rebecca (madameterralupus): BNE blog - we review memes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we document cosplay in the northeast USA
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i mean. doesnt bill have a webiste
Anna (loud and likely blonde): claim ur his manager
Marisa (Mawisa): My cousin is deaf and I know like 5 words in sign language so he brought me along as his interpreter to NYCC it was great. They provided an interpreter anyway, front row seats at all events and we could use the back entrance into the venue.
Marisa (Mawisa): That was the medical badge
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ahhhhhh
Marisa (Mawisa): People with the medical badge typically get one extra to have a handler or assistant, like an ASL interpreter for deaf or a wheelpusher pusher or such
Marisa (Mawisa): Actually if anyone knows an EMT, cons are always looking for them. A lot of people pass out at cons at they’re required to have one EMT at hand at all times.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Annette's bf is one~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Annette's bf becomes BNE EMT
Mark (Mad Doctor): If they need a medieval doctor, I've got a jar of leeches
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I can do CPR, help choking ppl. And. 
Uh. Severe bleeding control.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): And some first aid?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~explain how that's my repertoire ~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): fuck i gotta figure out how to not only fit my current costumes in this suitcase but also a kirigumi????
Georgia (Something Sensible): _wear it_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): <-<
>->
<-< u right
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but rlly like i think it takes up more room than grimm yang.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~well Grimm Yang covers significant less skin~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I got valentines at work to give out but ya gotta color then and I'm suffering atm... might just scratch these and do something else LOL
Anna (loud and likely blonde): give people them with dollar tree crayon packs
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THIS X100000000
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I have been so much more relaxed since I decided to push star butterfly for another convention, and I dont feel bad about it at all because I'll be back at katsu next year anyway! 
Its not worth it to make yourself sick over a cosplay xD I vouch for this statement so hardcore
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah im much happier making pyrrha more comfortable and spending time upgrading her than trying to jam in another cosplan
Jamie (Jamie): same its why i'm mainly just making sure I finish Jeanne instead of my original plans woth at least 2 other full build cosplays
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Same. I feel that with Winter and my other cosplays. I like tweaking what I gave rather than make 10 new things. 

Like the only reason I'm still working on Summer is cause I wanna touch her up now. She was done until her official render got released. 

But it's a matter of slapping on a lining and cutting up a shirt
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And making cuffs which I have all the materials for
