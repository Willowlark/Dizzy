Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey anyone going to Lancaster Pride on the 20th of July?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My uncles are in the process of adopting a son. He's gay and it will be his first pride, and I was wondering how Lancaster Pride is.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I bet that guy who protests Zenkai is going to be there.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Meh he can yell all he wants
Mark (Mad Doctor): He got Gayed away from Zenkai. I imagine the same will happen at Pride
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh... Oh he'll definitely be Gayed away. XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ive never been but I've heard good things about it from friends who have gone in te past
Georgia (Something Sensible): I didn’t know there were more pride events happening around here!
Georgia (Something Sensible): I went to Carlisle pride last week
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’d consider going to Lancaster
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YAAAAAS
