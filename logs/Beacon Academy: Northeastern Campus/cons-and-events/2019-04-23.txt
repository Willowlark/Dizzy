Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!184437198865563648>. I think you have most the info on this event right. ğŸ‘†  It cool if I bring a friend if they have off or do we already got a booked amount?
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need to call them back...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh?
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): I believe we're booked for 2pm.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): But I wanna double check. Iirc so long as we didn't have more than 30 or something, it's the same rate.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): But they'll want a head count closer to the event.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okii ğŸ‘Œ
