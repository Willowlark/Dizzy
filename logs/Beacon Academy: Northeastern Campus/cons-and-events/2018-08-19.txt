Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!386567060026556417> so how early can we show up at Chestnut Hill?
Mark (Mad Doctor): We don't have access to the buildings before 2:00, but if the weather is nice, I don't see any problem with showing up early.  I will check with them tomorrow to confirm. Should I check to see if we can get building access early? From what I gathered, it's a very quiet week on campus and they're pretty flexible
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Why not? I had originally assumed we'd be there like 11, and the more time to shoot inside and out the better.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Can't hurt to ask
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I can't think of better company to spend the day with after all.
