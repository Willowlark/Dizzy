Evie (Katheryne Knight): Rwby could technically count considering how big last year was.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Not as big as overwatch but stil pretty big
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ANYC put up room blocks...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They're actually pretty cheap, VERY cheap considering you're in NYC.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Less than anime next, most around 200-220.
Jess (whoozica): o damn
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If I go it'll probably be a day trip again
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~there's no penalty and no deposit, I booked one~~
Jess (whoozica): ðŸ‘€
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~oops I booked two just in case~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): luggage in the city would be annoying sure, but I really enjoyed this year so it nice to have the option.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh, tickets are on sale already.
Jess (whoozica): yeet
Jess (whoozica): so ayc would be 2 nights?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's what I booked.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But it's a total toss up.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): we could go in thursday and hit up a jazz club or something in the city, or we could just stay saturday into sunday?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~maybe I should have done thursday?~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *fixed it*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): God I love when there's no deposits on hotels.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ALSO they use the same system as Katsu, but ANYC's actually works.
Jess (whoozica): oof 6 big cons
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm not saying we have to do thursday, I just like having the option.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I can drop the reservation to a single night later.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Or entirely, for that matter.
Jess (whoozica): Not to say im not interested but i need to think about it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 233 a night is VERY palatable for NYC though. Anytime I've looked in NYC for hotels it's 300+ minimum.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Same, I'm not committing.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Just keeping the door open.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Because nooooo dowwwwwwnnnnn depossittttssssss*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WHAT HOTEL WAS IT?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Doubletree by Hilton New York Times Square West
Erik (Red Riot Thot): if y'all do Saturday into Sunday could I maybe tag along?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): probs.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeet
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ‘€ anyc weekend trip? ~~sounds fun~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~could I maybe join too if there is room?~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's not actually concrete yet, but also probs.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's less 'we're going' and more 'in 7 months we have the option of doing more than a day trip'.
Jess (whoozica): just curious, when is everyone planning on getting to katsu? ðŸ˜®
Matt (mattmyers25): I will be there early afternoon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thursday before 6 apparently xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thursday around 4-5ish

Jess (whoozica): maybe earlier is we make good time
Mak (hollyjollymak): Friday in the early afternoon, hopefully
I couldnâ€™t get around Friday classes this semester so I have to come on Friday, like some sort of novice ðŸ˜”
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oooof
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): that's suffering.
Jess (whoozica): AWW damn education, messin up everything XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think this year I worked extra hours during the week to leave early? I might just take a half day that day
Jess (whoozica): yea im doing a half day
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ^ that sounds familiar Erik, think you did.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I remember getting to my Airbnb around like 6-7ish or something
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I took a half day iirc.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I remember taking time to chill and get Five Guys before going to the Gaylord. I think I got there around 8 because you college kids were getting there later
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Depends on what the car pool situation looks like for me.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And then I waited in the badge line twice
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~college kids?~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Georgia and Hal and some others. I just remember them waiting to check in for a while
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Tom Jess and I beat both of them... Then I helped Georgia check in and Hal showed up after we got up to the room?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Something like that.
Jess (whoozica): we got stuck is traffic so we got there late-ish, im kins expecting the same thing to happen again
Jess (whoozica): ye i think we walked in and instantly saw Rebecca? and jamie? and erik? then we dropped stuff off and waited for georgia and crew
Jess (whoozica): oh no nvm we had to wait for georgia first
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): are we all staying in the gaylord this year?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Atrium here.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~someone needs to hang our flag~~
