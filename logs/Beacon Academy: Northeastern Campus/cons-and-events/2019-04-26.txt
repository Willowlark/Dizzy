Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sounds to me like ya good üëåüèª
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think the reservation system sends an acknowledgement number and the hotel sends a confirmation.  Either one should hold a room for you.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yeah. Hotel gets the confirmations from passkey and turns them into actual reservations.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Anyone get an atrium?
