Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@245270932602486784> are you planning on hosting a RWBY shoot at Katsu?
you want fucking rwby chibi?: my qpp is hosting one on friday
Georgia (Something Sensible): im not hosting tho ill volunteer to help run it if jackie needs assistance
Georgia (Something Sensible): jackie is actually the source of the rwby shoot list i use at every shoot
Georgia (Something Sensible): SO i have full confidence she wont fuck it up lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Any idea what time I'm Friday? OwO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Okie doke, so Friday will probs be my RWBY day lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): actually reiley you wanna let jackie know that i got her if she needs help? ~~im not saying people are starting to recognize my shooting running but its a little scary~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): i suggested 2 pm
Georgia (Something Sensible): idk if jackie settled on that or not
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~if it's not too late maybe I'll stay in Raven longer with Matt lol~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): i told her it should be either in the first half of the day (10-4) or second half (4-10) because people usually change around 3 or 4
Georgia (Something Sensible): so i suggested 2, as i also have to change into ochako later in the day
Georgia (Something Sensible): reiley did jackie say if she decided on that time yet or not?
Georgia (Something Sensible): i guess i have to start building my own katsu schedule... fuck
Georgia (Something Sensible): this nora actually messaged me this morning like "hey im doing nora friday PM would you wanna group up?" and i was ike "o sorry im only in pyrrha until 4" and she was like "oh ok it can be the morning too!"
Georgia (Something Sensible): im flattered someone would message me first, tho jess is still my #1 💖
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww 💕
Jess (whoozica): Oh hi
Jess (whoozica): Yea imma be in Nora then too probs
Mark (Mad Doctor): RWBY shoot on Friday? I'd like do do Jacques at Katsu, but bringing out the schneestache early limits facial hair options for later in the con.
Georgia (Something Sensible): what lineup were you kicking around?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Arthur, The Hound, Tony Stark, Jacques, and now maybe Stan Lee.  That's in order of diminishing facial hair
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LOL this sounds like what my one friend did at Katsu the other year... every day I saw him he had less and less facial hair XD
Marisa (Weeb): do you use your real facial hair? :0
Matt (mattmyers25): I will be qrow all day Friday
Marisa (Weeb): 12am to 11:59pm qrow
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He just sleeps in Qrow all of Thurs night XD
Marisa (Weeb): I want to bring Neon back for something but i'm lowkey waiting for my friend to say when he's next cosplaying Flynt 👀

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2181433998796376&id=1545576429048806 panel applications for kogaracon. Cute mini con, for anyone looking to get their feet wet in panels.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *better start getting my Impulse Buying 101 panel ready
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): DO IT. FUCKING DO IT.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ll coshost that. With a very loud counter. And just tick it every time you talk about something you bought.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"Hey kids! So... you just got your paycheck... WELL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS THING CALLED AMAZON DOT COM!"*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Live impulse buying demonstration
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Watch me as I blow $1k on shit I don't need
Rebecca (madameterralupus): omg
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Just for the record, I am as bad (if not maybe worse) as you.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Today I've been looking at a 200 dollar pocket knife.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Which I may not buy, but the 100 dollar variant I might.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Or let someone else get me so they can have an easier time getting me Christmas presents~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): After watching this week's AHWU, might I suggest this as an alternative?

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm one of those assholes who buys everything they want when they want it <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I need to check the javits center rules on knives*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I had my pocket knife last year, of course, but I did get stopped at madison square garden last weekend.
Jess (whoozica): is that just a box of different blades?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's a box full of swords and knives and shit
Jess (whoozica): that amazing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://youtu.be/WCL5-N1DD5U?t=658
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also Bill: https://smile.amazon.com/Supreme-Blades-Folding-Tactical-Stainless/dp/B01M07GKFC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=power-hand-tools&ie=UTF8&qid=1542141164&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=credit+card+knife&psc=1
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yeaaaah it's not that I need a knife knife, I like the utility of a pocket knife.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like... $120 for a bunch of swords and knives... It's a great deal... *I just have nowhere to put it all*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007QCP4G/?coliid=IIIZGMGRQDTPX&colid=21Q5VGY3FYKY1&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it Thinking about this one.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have one with more tools in it, but I'd trade some of them for a bigger handle.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ah gotcha
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Admittedly, I most use the blade, but the screw drivers have come in handy dozens of type, and the bottle opener cause 🍺
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Scissors on occasion (usually I want to be a cool guy and use the knife instead).
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): http://www.sakwiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=Champion+Plus I carry this bastard everywhere.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've got this little guy in my wallet. Have yet to actually really use it, but it's neat to have
Jess (whoozica): Does anyone know of any BHNA group shoots for katsu besides these 2? specifically on friday?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.facebook.com/events/1772290856225203/
Jess (whoozica): thank youuu
