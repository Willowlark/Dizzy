Georgia (Something Sensible): Seeing the follower number tick down as I block off spam accounts that follow me
Georgia (Something Sensible): But it’s better in the long run oof
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's something I need to go through and do at some point lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes definitely
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Idk how to really see spam accounts tho
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I can tell some are and some aren't
Georgia (Something Sensible): “namelessfap” ok deleting that one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): why are you even bothering tho.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean I don’t want my follower number to be a fake number
Georgia (Something Sensible): Engagement rate is a factor too
Georgia (Something Sensible): “greasy_clit” EUGH
Georgia (Something Sensible): _these usernames my dudes_
Jess (whoozica): OH GOD NO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wtf?! Was that an actual username followig you??
Georgia (Something Sensible): Y E A H
Mark (Mad Doctor): I knew someone by that name in college. Scottish origin, I believe
Georgia (Something Sensible): my standards are low this time around
Georgia (Something Sensible): im force unfollowing people with dirty usernames, pictures of boobs/butts as profile pictures, and people who couldnt bother to make a profile pic or post any content
Mark (Mad Doctor): Fair criteria
Georgia (Something Sensible): and my analytics app already identified them as ghost followers anyways
Georgia (Something Sensible): "a_wordshiperof_unrequitedlove"
Georgia (Something Sensible): interesting
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): clearly a fool.
Georgia (Something Sensible): "salemshusband"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oscar?
Georgia (Something Sensible): lots of people whos usernames are keyboard smash
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof.. I dropped 130 from what I just cleaned out now lol
Marisa (Mawisa): :0
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Maybe it's because I'm a guy, but I don't really get those kinds of accounts following me
Marisa (Mawisa): if i cleaned up i'd only have like 7 followers
Mark (Mad Doctor): I don't get them either. Is this a wierd form of flirting? "She's bound to notice me if I make a garbage account"
Jess (whoozica): i dont have any either
Jess (whoozica): i do have lances.nipples
Marisa (Mawisa): o i can't go through my followers without getting excited
"it's that guy! i remember him! and that girl! i remember her! and them! woah!!"

Georgia (Something Sensible): whats your engagement usually?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like really bad... At most I get 60-ish likes lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): On a post. Rarely any comments.
Georgia (Something Sensible): the average for under 1k is like 10-15% i think
Georgia (Something Sensible): and for over 1K its supposed to be like 5%
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OOF
Georgia (Something Sensible): statistically speaking
Georgia (Something Sensible): who knows how many people buy fake followers and ruin that statistic
Rebecca (madameterralupus): True. Everytime I hear people buy followers I'm like,,... ehhh??
Marisa (Mawisa): my cousin has 72k and averages around 15k likes per post, his new wife has 355k and averages around 30k likes so that's around 10%ish?
Marisa (Mawisa): i can't math
Georgia (Something Sensible): carrying the decimal over one spot makes 10%
Georgia (Something Sensible): so your cousin has like 20% and his wife like 10%
Marisa (Mawisa): thank u math wizard
Marisa (Mawisa): 🙏
Georgia (Something Sensible): u welc
Georgia (Something Sensible): omg im still not done
Georgia (Something Sensible): its gonna be sad to see how many i lost

Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel like marie kondo, do these followers spark joy?
Georgia (Something Sensible): no they dont, ***YEET***
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Just cleared out 34 inactives and spam accounts
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I *just* got to 800...
Georgia (Something Sensible): If you take your latest post tho, youll see that your engagement rate goes up
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Probably going to try to find an app that can detect inactive accounts and go through again
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee I can't find any good apps. All the ones I find want me too pay and I'm like nahh bish I'll just suffer and go through them myself XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): lmao what a mood
Georgia (Something Sensible): so my engagement rate went from 21.82 >>> 22.26
Georgia (Something Sensible): from just clearing out 87 inactives
