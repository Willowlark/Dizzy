Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~especially if we call ahead~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~If they do call aheads that is lol~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Many places don't call ahead saturdays in cities.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also idk if we'd even have ALL 20 of us due to conflicting schedules
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ True
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We'll see what we can do lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): GUESS WE HAVE TO UBER TO CHILIS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GUESS SO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean... there's one only like 10-15 mins outside the city LOL
Marisa (Mawisa): i have staff duties until 7 but if it's any time after that i'd like to join
we could have a picnic in the lobby or something
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao just take over the lobby... RIP

Marisa (Mawisa): if after 7 doesn't work tho don't let me hold you back
Marisa (Mawisa): live ur dreams
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): A pj party is probably a better idea.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): cookie party.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): whatever in that vein.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~real food though~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): üëÄ

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ VALID
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i hate that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): too social to be restrained by a table
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Pizza party at reg would be best for a full BNE event then.

You can't actually fit one up there between the trees... i mean i bet you COULD but i dont own an ATV. ~~my dad would probs drive us up on the backhoe... wait. no nvm the vehicle bridge was out~~ 
~~its like an under ten minute walk up to the waterfalls its just in the middle of the woods on my property that we didnt actually hack out more than a trail to lmfao~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): jamie lets go hiking i love that shit
Matt (mattmyers25): Ok lol I was just thinking for cosplay shoots if props would need to be lugged up there
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea honestly theres a smaller waterfall at the bottom right at my neighbor's property and a cute ass bridge that if i asked she'd def let me use
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~considering my brother found her smoking pot there she doesnt give a crap~~
