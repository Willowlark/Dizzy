Jess (whoozica): pray my nejire wig comes in on time
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Everyone is doing BNHA now I feel left out ðŸ˜« ~~I'd do it too but all my content right now is rwby and bnha so trying to do diff stuff lol~~
Jess (whoozica): MOOD
Jess (whoozica): that was me last weekend ngl
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Do what's fun, don't try to provide for your fans.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You started cosplaying for you, not for the followers.
Halim (Greg): I have no content anyways so /shrug
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You right Bill. Lol. Thus is why I am planning my little Shinoa~. Plus I dont really have anything BNHA to wear anyways cause hero deku is in storage to sell and gym deku needs hand washed ~~which i am too lazy to do~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm rethinking my whole Katsu cosplans. I'd love to do Jacques there, but the stache limits other facial hair options. I also want to do Tennant's character from Gen:Lock, and maybe The Hound.
