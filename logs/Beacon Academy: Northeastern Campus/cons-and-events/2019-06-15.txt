Jamie (Jamie): Guys top or bottom shoes for this outfit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Uhhh bottom?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Bottom
Anna [Cyborg]: I feel like. Incredible fomo rn cause WWP, yeticon, and Brooklyn comiccon are all happening this weekend and it feels like every non rwby cosplayer I know is at one of them
Anna [Cyborg]: Oh that's another thing to add to my cosplay self roast
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wait. There's non-RWBY cosplay?
Anna [Cyborg]: Apparently. 
I have to divide my con/cosplay friends into 'cosplays rwby' and 'doesnt cosplay RWBY' bc that's the only divide I can make
Anna [Cyborg]: Obviously the latter section hasn't seen the light yet
