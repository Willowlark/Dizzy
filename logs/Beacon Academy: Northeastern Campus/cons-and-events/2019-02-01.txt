Georgia (Something Sensible): I‚Äôve been so good at not spending extra money so I can save it for Katsu
Georgia (Something Sensible): But also that means at Katsu _i will have no monetary inhibitions_
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): You don't buy much at cons anyway, you'll be fine.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You could put it towards like, *food* or something
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~wish i could say the same but i spent like $200 on amazon stuff~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): _why would I spend my Katsu money on something so rational and important_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i think he means. at katsu.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): do they serve katsu at katsucon
Anna (loud and likely blonde): bvc
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no but they have "walking nachos"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): elaborate
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they open a bag of chips
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and dumb cheese and meat in
Anna (loud and likely blonde): prevent me from eating them
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and you walk away with a bag of nachos
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WALKING TACOS ARE AMAZING
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that kinda sounds bad tbh. 
~~how do they not have katsu they missed a great opportunity~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theyre actually pretty good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not gonna lie
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): however i would not recommend eating them in elaborate cosplay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's no different than having it outside of a bag except that it's in a bag
Georgia (Something Sensible): They have very expensive chicken fingers as well
Anna (loud and likely blonde): no one let me eat cheese
Anna (loud and likely blonde): bc i will try to eat cheese
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't think I bought any food at the Gaylord last year. I lived off McDonalds for the most part

Erik (Red Riot Thot): So it's chicken bacon with ranch on the side? Ok, I'm back in
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ye its ranch on the side
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~Dominos isn't real food, eating a whole pie is easy~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There was a restaurant near me that used to have personal pizzas where you could get 3 toppings and I used to get chicken, bacon, and steak and it was the most amazing pizza
Anna (loud and likely blonde): personally i think ceasar dressing tastes better on it but like. chicken bacon ceasar doesnt  sound as satisfying to say

Anna (loud and likely blonde): lmfao what kinda rule is that
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): It's a bullshit law.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i would bring my passport out to spite them
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but also like what if a state gives all vertical licenses cause like i think NC has vertical licenses normally
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): <@184437198865563648>  are vertical state id's okay?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Not sure.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Erik's driver's license crapped out.
Jess (whoozica): id assume that if a vertical license didn't work a state id wont either, but im not sure üò¶
Anna (loud and likely blonde): from what i can read online it isnt even a MD law its just establishments that have rules. you can probs say 'this is a government ID, not a license. I don't drive.' when you hand it over or something
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29750-i78-k9589202-Vertical_ID_Acceptance-Atlantic_City_New_Jersey.html
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm trying to find the actual law
Jess (whoozica): apparently different counties can have their own laws too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just remember seeing in someone's story last year that the Gaylord refused their license because it was vertical
