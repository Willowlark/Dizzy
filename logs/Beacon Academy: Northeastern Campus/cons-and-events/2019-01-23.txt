Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I know you already sent your email, but for reference: 

```Hello,

My name is Bill Clark and Iâ€™m contacting you as per your policyâ€™s page about a photography question. I am part of a group of friends (numbering around 20 or so) that like to craft costumes and then get photos of the costumes in character, as our collective hobbies. A member of our group brought up your park as a place that would be amazing to take photos and Iâ€™m one hundred percent inclined to agree. Our use is mostly personal, for posting to social media and sharing with other enthusiasts, though there is an off chance a person may wish to make prints of their photos taken on site for personal sale.

We would love to visit Knoebels as our group and spend a day at the park, both to practice our hobbies and to enjoy the park. We of course, donâ€™t want to cause any confusion while we visit, so if you could clarify a few questions and let us know if we have permission to visit in costumes, weâ€™d greatly appreciate it. Iâ€™ve listed our questions, and if you need any information from me I can be contacted either at clark.wrc@outlook.com or by phone at 9089147076. Weâ€™d look to come sometime in spring or early summer, if that time frame is okay with the park. I look forward to hearing from you and visiting the park!
```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ```1. Is wearing costumes be allowed at the park?

2. Would bringing props that are associated with costumes (hand held) be allowed? If they are fake weapon shaped, is that allowed?

3. Would we be able to come during regular hours to photograph our outfits? If not or if it is more convenient, can we come off hours?

4. Would there be any additional rules we can follow from the park to be good guests?

5. Would someone be allowed to sell a print with Knoebels in the background? (This is truly an edge case, just to ensure we donâ€™t accidentally do so 2 years down the road if that would be an issue. Weâ€™d have no issues respecting only personal use, as no one has intentions to use any photos for more than social media at the moment to begin with!)

6. Would you need us to inform you in advance that weâ€™re coming?

Thank you very much,

Bill Clark```

Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lol we still doing that?

Marisa (Mawisa): o my aunt and uncle go to that flower show every year

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Pretty much lol ^
Anna (Cadmium): you assume that i would want yall to come to long island for any reason. its awful here
Anna (Cadmium): i swear if i get a DEC job in the city im moving closer to the city
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My parents grew up on long island, I got family there.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~won't argue terrible tho~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Though I'm tiring of the city, but I commute 2 1/2 hours so staying past 5 o clock means i get home at like 10 or 11 and I have to get up 5, 6 next morning.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Bad combo for adventuring.
Anna (Cadmium): mood. 
I just hate this island
Anna (Cadmium): friends i have been tasked with purchasing a kigu at katsu for troy. 
she gave no guidelines. 
:)
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Anna (Cadmium): jesus
Anna (Cadmium): Hi Anna,

Thank you so much for reaching out! Because these photos are for-profit, we would consider that a branded photoshoot. We are available for photoshoots like this on Wednesdays (when we are closed to the public). Our fee is usually $800 per hour with a minimum of 4 hours, but we could potentially waive the minimum if you don't think you will need that much time. Let me know if you think something like this could work for you. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

xo,
Sarah
Anna (Cadmium): ^that was color factory's response so im asking in more and nicer words, if we never sell photos can we still come to take photos in costumes
Anna (Cadmium): ~~if she says no then im just gonna use the excuse that wednesdays is the only day for us that we cant all do and thank her for her time~~
Jess (whoozica): oof
Marisa (Mawisa): $3200 for 4 hours lets do it
Jess (whoozica): I'd still be open to going just to see the exhibit thou, no cosplay
Matt (mattmyers25): Yes
Anna (Cadmium): yea i wanna go see it and take cute photos cause i havent updated my personal instagram in 4 months
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i wanna act like a kid in a crayon box~~
Anna (Cadmium): better news. weiss wig on the way
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~do any of us even sell prints beside hunter?~~
Marisa (Mawisa): i gave out business cards once
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Not that I'm aware.
Anna (Cadmium): lmfao 
I mean like. Eventually i wanna sell prints or polaroids
Anna (Cadmium): but like thats legit to just give money to hunter lmao
Anna (Cadmium): oh i wanna sell cards. thats what i wanted
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, asking for print rights does push the grey area line to the paid kind.
Anna (Cadmium): yeah i could have worded it better in the email but they seem to respond p quick
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's at least nice.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's also NYC, so they're going to expect legit photographers. Gotta sound like a humble student.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nothing from Knoebels.
Anna (Cadmium): yeah i mean theres gotta be  some high fashion shoots too like
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Quite likely.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~also shout out to that wednesday would be a big issue for most people~~
Anna (Cadmium): yeaaaaaaaaa def gotta be sat or sun
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm guessing this won't fly, tbh.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): When you say cards... what kind of cards?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~BNE Trading cards?~~
Anna (Cadmium): yea collect us all. they got stupid facts about us on them
Anna (Cadmium): no lol like xmas cards and holiday cards
Anna (Cadmium): i wanna take some erasermic pics with a super grumpy aizawa
Anna (Cadmium): and i mean, even if it doesnt fly it was worth an ask right
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oh absolutely. And I'm a pessimist.
Anna (Cadmium): same. usually im the pessimist tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): 800 PER HOUR, WTF THATS CRAY
Georgia (Something Sensible): _they cant catch us if we actually dye our hair and coincidentally have color coordinated outfits, HA_
Anna (Cadmium): *goes super casually bc they say to wear a color soooooo*
Anna (Cadmium): ~~just someone else buy the tickets so my names not on it~~
Anna (Cadmium): to be fair if we wear solid colored wigs. is it cosplay or is it just playing in costumes
Jess (whoozica): Isn't playing in costumes like the textbook definition of Cosplay?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.phillyvoice.com/marvel-superheroes-franklin-institute-spring-exhibit-costumes-comics/
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm so taking the kids this summer. For educational purposes, natch
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omg omg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i wanna go
Mark (Mad Doctor): Think they'd notice if I borrowed a prop or two?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe if you dress up they will just think you are part of the exhibit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that way you can walk out with props and no one will question it
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just found one infinity stone, I peomise
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wonder if they'd consider a cosplay special event
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Group trip??
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~BNE infiltrates every cool place 2k19~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): my best friend from college really wants to go to franklin institute, but doesn't have a group to go. If BNE we to I'd invite him.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): everyones welcome ðŸ˜®
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hey stupid question, is franklin institute like the liberty science museum?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah basically.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): From what I've heard.
Marisa (Mawisa): it has a giant heart you can walk inside but some parts are super narrow and i've always wondered how many people get stuck in there
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need to go to LSC before the holmes exhibit leaves.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Franklin Institute is hella neat
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They have a giant Foucault's Pendulum in the main stairwell
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oooo that sounds cool
Mark (Mad Doctor): That heart scared the chicken salad out of me when I was four. It still does
Mark (Mad Doctor): I have hung out with the chief astronomer there. Very cool guy.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah the heart is very claustrophobic
Mark (Mad Doctor): Here's the museum's promo:
https://www.fi.edu/exhibit/marvel-universe-super-heroes
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just remembered that two local cosplayers (superschiggys and generalvogel) did a cosplay shoot in the Franklin institute. The museum was cool with it, but they freaked out some normals
Mark (Mad Doctor): They just told me that the museum was cool with them rolling up in cosplay and taking pictures
Anna (Cadmium): omg i went to the SHIELD thing back when they had it in times square. you need to go see all the props n costumessssss
