Georgia (Something Sensible): everyone going to bnha is going to rwby as well, to my knowledge
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe I'll just do BNHA then since I won't be able to show up till 9:30-ish anyways lol

Georgia (Something Sensible): _denki valkyrie_
Jess (whoozica): I might stop by RWBY but in Mina cuz idk how I feel about removing body paint just to be Nora for like an hour and then putting it back on
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Extra pink Nora lol
Jess (whoozica): LOL
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Imma swap out PJ Blake for PJ Jaune so I can quickly change into Denki I think lol~~
