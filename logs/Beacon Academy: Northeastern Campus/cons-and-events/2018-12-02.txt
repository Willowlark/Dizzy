Mark (Mad Doctor): So Pax Unplugged was a lot of fun. Not a big cosplay scene (only about a hundred cosplayers, in my estimation), but a lot of positive energy. Crowded but not too crowded. I think there were over 300 vendors, all selling tabletop games (we noted the absence of any vendors selling fan merch, for instance). Huge open gaming area with hundreds of games to borrow, with ways to connect with other gamers.  Terrible food in the convention center, and Reading Terminal Market was more crowded than I have ever seen it. Fortunately, Chinatown was a block away
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If I didnâ€™t have plans this weekend with family Iâ€™d have gone.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Itâ€™s definite maybe next year.
