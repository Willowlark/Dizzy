Mark (Mad Doctor): Otakon RWBY shoot has been scheduled for Saturday @9:00. Not a great slot, but they also offered Sunday at 9, 10, and 11. Would people rather do early on Saturday or later on Sunday?
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): Iâ€™m gonna be a neener and ping @everyone because I know a lot of people arenâ€™t going to Otakon but the feedback would be nice (pretend yâ€™all are) (and then yâ€™all can be furious at me for pinging everyone) (I lost the game)
ZombieHunter: Hunter can actually attend Saturday >.>
Jess (whoozica): 9pm? or am? ðŸ˜®
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): AM
Jess (whoozica): whew damn
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): Rise and shine nerds
Jess (whoozica): im not sure if im doing rwby at all at ota but i would think Saturday is better since people will be getting ready and checking out on sunday?
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): Arenâ€™t most people done moving out by 11?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah Saturday is better
Georgia (Something Sensible): Saturday 9 am?
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): Thatâ€™s the current slot ye
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Friday is better   tbh.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Rwby seems to be an off day for Ota on most people's lineup.
Georgia (Something Sensible): aLRIGHT time to find something to WEAR
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I can't do RWBY
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm already doing Rin and 9Am is not happening XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): neither is 9 PM XD
Matt (lastbetatestercosplay): I like how there are 2 Disney photoshoots. It looks like they are hosted by the same person
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): <@!386567060026556417>  you could also do an unofficial shoot if more people can't make it that time on Saturday? I can probably make it, I just don't know how many others can
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah, I think it will be the few and hardy who make it to a 9am shoot. Anyone know how to promote an unofficial shoot?
Anna [Cyborg]: Facebook event shared to the con FB group if allowed, and the RWBY cosplay group?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Marisa can't make it on Friday. Anyone want to go in with me on an unofficial shoot?
Georgia (Something Sensible): alas i  would volunteer but i shant be there friday either
Georgia (Something Sensible): unofficial shoot isnt a bad idea
Georgia (Something Sensible): that was the better shoot at otakon two years ago
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm still scheduling things friday so I'm not sure what availability I have at the moment.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I've already scheduled a shoot with Marisa for Salem on Saturday, plus I won't be getting to the con until late on Friday
