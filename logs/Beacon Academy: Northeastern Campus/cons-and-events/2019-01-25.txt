Rebecca (madameterralupus): Katsu badge finally bought <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Laser tag. Leanna sparked it, I'mma push the issue.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YES i want to destroy all of you
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and every 7 year old there
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *bold of you to assume you can hit my lithe, massive frame*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): listen i dont work out, but laser tag is enough exercise for me for the rest of my life
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There's Laser One up in the sussex boonies, a place in Rockaway which is by me. If we have enough people, maybe we can do an actual booking of the place.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Whose going to pretend to have their birthday at a laser tag place~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): erik said theres a place by him that does lock ins overnight
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Need a head count, and an ideal location.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ‘€
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): find the name boi.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@!386874959009415170>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~but also mood to Erik's comment on fb; I'm tired by 10pm as an adult~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean same
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but laser tag gives me enough adrenaline to stay awake for 6 days straight
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like its ridiculous
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i lose my entire mind
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe i shouldve done a sport as a kid
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like, I was trying to go to the gaming bar by me when people were there. Like. No one even comes there till 10. I go out at *6* and want to be *in bed* by 10.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mood
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have to double check if they still do them. I haven't been there is ages so they might have changed things
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>  ye
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): even if they dont we should still all go to laser tag anyway
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ^
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Hence push issue.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Your area is pretty central to BNE Leanna, any places by you?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): funplex?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats not really near me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its closer to georgia i think
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): iplay america
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in freehold
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): that the place with the like, 4 floor ball pit.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Cause.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i just found out theres a thing called tactical laser tag and i think i wanna join a team~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~cosplay fitness<:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> ~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also i have no idea bill
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Looking at the Facebook page of the place by me, doesn't look like they do the lock-ins anymore. They just have "latenighters" which are 11pm-3am
Erik (Red Riot Thot): For like, the same price the lock-ins used to be
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~do tell that sounds amazing leanna~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~it's like outdoor lasertag, basically paintball without the pain~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.fireballmountain.com/
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ooooh I think I've heard of them.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Laser tag in the Gazebo~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~bring laser tag to katsucon~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh neat, the website for the place like me has one of those inside views from Google maps and you can actually go in the play area to look lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ohhhh thats really cool
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): link?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): pretty sure fireball mountain is by my college, that might be a viable location. 30 bucks for 90 minutes game play sounds better than Laser one's pricing.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.laserquest.com/pa-wyomissing/pricing/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): scroll down
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Shoot each other, then drink wine.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Very bond villain.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): sounds like a good time
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Fireball mountain got a lot of shit. Just is outdoor.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): though it would be more fun to shoot your shitty boss with paintball so it actually hurts... But I GUESS tHATS TOO CHAOTIC
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~there's probably a 50/50 chance my boss would do a laser tag game for a corporate event~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 250 for minimum 10 people, +25 for every additional up to like, 40.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): hour and a half gameplay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not bad
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~and for three fitty a piece you can get a custom dog tag.~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "lord explosion murder"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *cosplay laser tag*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ya'll better wear something you can move in~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): you'd pay more than that at Laser One.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Wouldn't stress cosplay for this one.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~especially since the people running'll be macho types prob~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also how quickly would you lose a wig sprinting in the woods.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™m picturing Leannaâ€™s Yang wig flying away.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it would be SNATCHED
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i wouldnt even notice
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i would def have to be bakugo though, i basically become him during laser tag
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~someone cosplay aoharu x kikanjuu itâ€™s literally ouran host club with guns~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Late to chat but OwO laser tag??
Rebecca (madameterralupus): There's a place by me too but idk what all "fun" things they do anymore lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ye I'd say do laser tag as a non cosplay thing, just for like. Costume safety.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bold of you to assume I wouldnâ€™t casual cosplay

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'd rather just go to CC Main or CCE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i  high key just want an excuse to go on a cruise/vacation~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~same. I've never been on a cruise and they look like so much fun~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I really want to go on a cruise too. ~~Although my dad says i'd not like it??~~
