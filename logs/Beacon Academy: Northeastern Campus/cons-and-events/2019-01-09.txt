Mark (Mad Doctor): Jessica Nigri has said she's going, too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wasn't she supposed to go last year too but then canceled?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Serthers is delicious
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yep
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Werthers
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But she didnt go last year due to stress, seems like shes been taking it easy though so I would say shell be there
Mark (Mad Doctor): Don't think she's going in an official capacity, so keep your eyes peeled...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Two years ago I ran into her 4 separate times and didnt even recognize her 3 of the 4 times  so RIP me
Matt (mattmyers25): I want to meet her one day
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey's goal is to be stepped on by her
Marisa (Mawisa): Of all the “famous” cosplayers, svetlana is the most approachable. Yaya Han and Jessica usually have a crowd of fans/bodyguards and are busy most times but Svetlana is chill and she’ll take selfies and chat with you she’s so sweet
Matt (mattmyers25): I want to meet stella chu.  I was right next to her in a CVS last year and I didn't get to say hi to her
Anna (Cadmium): Lmao I actually met yaya han briefly while buying foam clay. She was at NYCC at a table
Anna (Cadmium): My goal in life is to meet Svetlana
Matt (mattmyers25): Lets invite them to cons near us

Marisa (Mawisa): Ask the con! Every single year conventions ask for desired guests and very few people submit requests.
Marisa (Mawisa): But it takes months of negotiation so you gotta request early
Marisa (Mawisa): Matt Mercer has been a really popular request this year
