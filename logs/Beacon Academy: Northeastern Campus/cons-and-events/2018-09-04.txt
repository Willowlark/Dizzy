Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ is there a cosplay contest at CCE?~~

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ but this costume came out way better than i thought it would and i kinda wanna be a show off ðŸ‘€ ~~

Erik (slendergiant): So another ticket-related panic attack I just had. I wanted to make sure I had my ticket for the Vol 6 premiere. Couldn't find it in my email. My Regal Account had no record of me getting a ticket. Went to the website to buy it again and at checkout the payment method window popped up and I remembered that I paid via Amazon Pay which is linked to a different email address ðŸ˜…
