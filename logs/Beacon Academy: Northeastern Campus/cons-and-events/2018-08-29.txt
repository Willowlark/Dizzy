Rebecca (madameterralupus): AwwwI'm sorry girl 😦 I hope it heals up soon
Erik (slendergiant): So for CCE, does anyone usually still do cosplays on Sunday? Or do people just enjoy the waterpark (if the passes are still valid)?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I didn't waterpark last year since wasn't at Kalaari but I did still cosplay that day lol (and passes are valid till waterpark closes that day even after check out)
Erik (slendergiant): Sweet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): People cosplay plenty. Waterpark is valid, but we didn't do it cause no where to change.
Marisa (Weeb): why wouldn't you cosplay the sunday of a con 🙀
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You can change in a bathroom XD (I know the lockers are along walls of waterpark so idk if they necessarily have a "locker room") lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think they do have one.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think sunday is best for doing the simplest cosplay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): something you don't mind getting wet ~~obviously~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): comfortable too preferably
Marisa (Weeb): break out the prosthetics and LEDs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yea, actually, go big or go home
Erik (slendergiant): and full armor
Marisa (Weeb): ;3c

Georgia (Something Sensible): So should we try to get together for realsies the sunday after CCE for sunflower photoshoot?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Thatd be Sunday September 16th

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -heavy breathing-
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Me and Jess have been there
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Take near her parents
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I was miserable cuz it was so hot 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Rebecca, Leanna, and Erik get priority though Georgia, it was their idea to start with. Assuming the three of them can do that sunday, it should be fine with me.
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): aye aye
Georgia (Something Sensible): id borrow a billiam camera again if you mean we need more photographers
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What I'll really need is an assistant to hold reflectors and such.
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah im game to rotate out
Georgia (Something Sensible): we did that at chestnut hill
Georgia (Something Sensible): and frankly, my backlog of photos is at like 100+ left still to post to insta
Georgia (Something Sensible): so im not starved for content
Georgia (Something Sensible): the flowers are just purty
Georgia (Something Sensible): if we wanna do this chestnut hill style too, and make an event, we could get some more friendos
Georgia (Something Sensible): but idk what kinda style youd wanna go for
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't really want to march in there in force, especially given it's fairly short notice and it's still going to be an active business. Lots of normies there for the flowers as well.
Georgia (Something Sensible): aye aye lemme know what the plan ends up being
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!386874959009415170> <@!334090409389195266> <@!169297844874903552> September 16th, Sussex County Sunflower Maze, Afternoon, say 2 or 3? (You mentioned having something in the morning Erik?)
Erik (slendergiant): Ye
Erik (slendergiant): 3 would probably be better for me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Should be okay? Lemme just confirm with my parents at dinner tonight cause I know we talked about visiting grandparents either that day or the Saturday lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh! yea sunday works!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): When yo cosplaying with someone all weekend but they swap 2 of the costume days on ya when they post their line up 😒

😂😂😂😂 (sorry I had to do this call out cause it was too funny!) time to update mine. lol
Erik (slendergiant): lol sorry I was planning stuff with other people as well and that's where they fell
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂it's all good. I just thought it was really fjnny. Thankfully it's stuff I can easily move around and not have shoots booked for 😝
Georgia (Something Sensible): question, everyone has new years day off right?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I think so!
Georgia (Something Sensible): i know its early but im looking at my calendar, wondering if its ok to do new years on a monday night lol
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I feel a bit better
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can take off ~~cause i work retail~~
