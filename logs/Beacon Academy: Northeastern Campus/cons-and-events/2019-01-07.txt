Georgia (Something Sensible): O thank u based Erik
Anna (Cadmium): ok im actually dead looking at animal shelters in jersey rn
Anna (Cadmium): debating shooting off an email at some point
Anna (Cadmium): would we actually be able to do this calendar as BNE
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd be down~
Anna (Cadmium): i feel we gotta see if ppl would buy these but like. imagine getting a wide variety of rescue animals
Anna (Cadmium): i bet i can find a rescue horse  and maybe some lizards
Anna (Cadmium): or maybe we might just have to individually ask foster parents
Matt (mattmyers25): I would be down
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm thinking of vol. 4 purple bandage Qrow, holding my rickety old Foster dog, with the caption: "We all have to go. The important thing is to go surrounded by people who love you."
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yeah, it‚Äôs interesting.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WOW MARK
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Better to focus on shelter animals I think. The goal would be to get them adopted.
Anna (Cadmium): welllllllllllllll maybe we can have that on the like.  mini of next month calendar thats always on the back of calendars lol
yea but if we cant get any shelters that'll let us take animals to where we can photograph them. 
might have to do fosters
Mark (Mad Doctor): I can't imagine shelters that would object to the publicity
Anna (Cadmium): yea but if theyre short staffed who knows
Anna (Cadmium): also we do have to have a place to shoot this
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yeah. And we can have shelter staff with us. We plan in advance.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Go to a local park.
Anna (Cadmium): we might have to have an adultier adult than I organizing htis
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ooh, a Bakugo cosplayer with a dog or cat.  "Unconditional love"
Anna (Cadmium): Ruby and yang with a corgi
Mark (Mad Doctor): Natch
Anna (Cadmium): georgia with a german shepard hybrid
Anna (Cadmium): DO WE HAVE A VELVET THAT COULD HOLD A RESCUE BUNNY
Anna (Cadmium): omg or a dog/cat thats missing a leg with a s5 yang
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): If it helps with sounding professional
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I've worked with animals my entire working career
Mark (Mad Doctor): The shelter in South Jersey  where we got Mochi is adjacent to a municipal park. Not terribly attractive, if I recall
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): The hard part to me is finding the shelter to work with.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Organizing the rest isn‚Äôt too much.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Blake with a black cat tho
Anna (Cadmium): we could do it with a couple different shelters
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): More leg work.
Anna (Cadmium): we need bakugo holding the FLUFFIEST cat though
Anna (Cadmium): yea but  might work better to get more costume variety
Anna (Cadmium): im just saying im willing to make that drive multiple times cause i live on long island rn
Mark (Mad Doctor): I wanna do The Hound with a hound
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~are these all going to be puns~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Let's face it, I don't care what I do as long as I get to roll on the ground with a lot of dogs
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I‚Äôm okay with that.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Maybe King Arthur with a rabbit...
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): HA
Anna (Cadmium): ok but oz with an old doggo
Georgia (Something Sensible): I‚Äôm just gonna level with you my followers are 10 times more likely to buy wezrez merch if it‚Äôs got a big ol Pyrrha face on it
Georgia (Something Sensible): So we need an animal with a chest scar STAT
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Or Pyrrha and a yellow lab...?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Tad easier, much less Grimm.
Georgia (Something Sensible): THERES A FAUNUS JAUNE AU WHERE HES A YELLOW LAB
Georgia (Something Sensible): U right that cuter
Mark (Mad Doctor): The non-faunus Jaune is pretty much a golden retriever
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): As mark said.

Erik (Red Riot Thot): While we're on topic, my local animal shelter just posted this and I'm crying
