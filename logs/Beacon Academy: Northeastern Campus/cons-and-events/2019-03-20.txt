Mark (Mad Doctor): Weather is still looking good for this weekend, but winds will be 20-30 mph. Hold on to your wigs and props, kids.
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Can it be Friday nowww
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right? 😫
Jamie (Jamie): Reminds me i might mention very slim chances of me being at zenkai reason mainy blaming them for moving it to March again and not knowing this til katsu lol basically too much life stuff right now for con time (though sad breaking my streak)
Jamie (Jamie): Also simply cant afford even a one day badge right now lol next week maybe but too little too late it will be lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): dont stretch urself too thin is not worth
Jamie (Jamie): Yea pretty much my thinking on it. i can make my grand return next year lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): This might be my last Zenkai for a while
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): whys that :o?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): is it cause money cause fuckin same
Marisa (Mawisa): join staff! attend con for free! <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): dead the only reason i got to wintercon was they had me there as an artist
Georgia (Something Sensible): BNE Sexy Carwash for Cosplay
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Zenkai the cheapest con on the circuit tho.
Marisa (Mawisa): Cheap if you staff because free everything <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Animenext, Otakon are 250 a night. Katsu atriums are 320ish, CCE is 220 a night plus a bunch of fees. Zenkai is a flat 140 iirc?
Matt (mattmyers25): What helps with zenkai is that is isn't in a major city
Marisa (Mawisa): Before this year I never paid more than like $100 for a Katsu room
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): how many people to a room again?
Marisa (Mawisa): 8 to 9ish
Marisa (Mawisa): Majority cosplayers, I think we’d have one or two non cosplayers
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's insane so.
Marisa (Mawisa): That’s ordinary, s’what most rooms have as far as I know and it’s very doable
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 6 is cap.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 6 is cap I agreed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'd murder people if we had more than 6
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Same. 6 is my max for a hotel room. It's tight enough with that many lol
Marisa (Mawisa): Whaaaaat
Y’all crazy
Marisa (Mawisa): So much more expensive
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We are not all smol compact anime gurl like you Mawisa.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *You might refer to me as Sailor Bluto*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd rather have comfort and sanity than save money by cramming in more people.
Marisa (Mawisa): Fold up like a frisbee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Nein lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same rebecca
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i once got a hotel room just for me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): anext right before they went to AC
Marisa (Mawisa): BoJo and I might have a room to ourselves this weekend I’m really hype and hoping they don’t assign someone else to our room last minute
Marisa (Mawisa): But we aren’t paying for it 8)
Jess (whoozica): party at bojo/marisa room
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I can handle 6. I've never done more than 6 but even that can get crowded and stressful. But I know how to manage it so that's my max amount I'm okay with lol. I need walking room, space to breathe and not people up my arm pit all the time xD plus when ya add in props and bags it makes it even more crowded lol
Marisa (Mawisa): Bring party poppers
Marisa (Mawisa): Max we’ve done was 12 but it was one of those hotel rooms with a bedroom and a living room
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee that I could do cause space to move around and spread out. I mean we technically had 12 at CCE but we were split amongst 2 rooms lol
Marisa (Mawisa): it was still a “2 person hotel room” we only had one bed and it took up the whole bedroom but yeah more rooms more space
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~We have to force Marisa to not sleep under tables or in bathtubs~~
Marisa (Mawisa): 3 on bed 1 on floor next to bed 8 in other room
Marisa (Mawisa): *because imagine how many more people we could fit*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 3
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): on
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the bed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah we could’ve fit four if we went sideways but one person was really tall
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im having anxiety even imagining that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:leanna_pyrrha_scream:514147026741624887> <:leanna_pyrrha_scream:514147026741624887> <:leanna_pyrrha_scream:514147026741624887>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:blockyhands:484798627752181761>  N O <:blockyhands:484798627752181761>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We debated on doing 3 in a bed at Katsu (me, snow and Monica) this year until we added Gabe. Glad Gabe joined us cause idk if I could do that. I need space to move around.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://tenor.com/view/internally-screaming-gif-5264849
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Same Leanna xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): After I had the thought of doing that I was like lol nope. I love my girls but I need wigggle room and room to spread out xD hotel room beds aren't that big lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Having my own bed for RTX and only sharing with one person was v nice xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but then again, it was also a vacation so not intended to cram a bunch of people in one room
Erik (Red Riot Thot): > hears "fold yourself"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SarcasticNaughtyHerculesbeetle-small.gif
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah like that!
