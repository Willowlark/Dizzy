Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: listen im not waiting for the little white walk symbol to show up if nO ONE IS COMING
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Internally when that happens I'm like " dude just go, no ones coming. Its fine" but my brain is also like " if you do that you'll die immediately and will regret it" so I just stand on the edge teetering between jaywalking and staying put .... and then it turns white by the time I decide to cross anyway
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): 🙃
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: oh i mean one way streets with stoplights every 2 blocks kinda. reduces the opportunity for that
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): ... true
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Bro, maybe this is the key reason I hate NYC

Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: its fine i will make sure we do not die crossing streets
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh I cant walk slow due to anxiety too
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): The street crossing is the issue
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): People walking too slow pisses me off
