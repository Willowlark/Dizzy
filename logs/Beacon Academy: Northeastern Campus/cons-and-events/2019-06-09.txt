Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Are you going to Philly? Snow and I will be there!
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): <@!471742493105324042> I will tackle people for you at zenkai
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Woah nice!
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Knock knock
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm in Atlantic city
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yep, we're taking the train in. We'll be by independence hall for the parade before moving to Penn's landing
Mark (Mad Doctor): Might wear Soldier 76... (Subject to Audrey's embarrassment tolerance)
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm not sure where we'll be but we will be there around noon
Mark (Mad Doctor): Heading down now
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Is pride in AC too?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I wouldnt be surprised if they had a parade but I havent heard of ome happening there this week
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Ohh okay okay I got mixed up
Anna [Cyborg]: Is anyone thinking about NYC pride? I was considering going
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: is that next week?
Anna [Cyborg]: 30th I think
Anna [Cyborg]: I've never been so I wanna
Anna [Cyborg]: Also I saw a nyc pride condom on the ground and was like wait did that happen yet
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ngl there are two possibilities
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: 1. NYC Pride made condoms to throw at other Pride events to be like "come here too!"
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: 2. Its a pride condom from last years NYC Pride, and somebody dropped it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: both are hilarious
Anna [Cyborg]: U right
Mark (Mad Doctor): #1 made me giggle in a juvenile manner
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Ya know I just realized #1 included an innuendo
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sorry I missed Monica, Heather and Snow. Parade was a blast, but the scene at Penn's Landing was like an overcrowded con. Audrey had fun dancing angrily at some protestors and met some fellow weebs. Got some nice reactions to Soldier 76
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): üòÇüòÇ its fine, it is pretty crazy there
Anna [Cyborg]: I heard..... Gritty was at Philly pride
Mark (Mad Doctor): He's Philly's babadook
Anna [Cyborg]: I have an undying love for gritty
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's funny: when they first revealed his design, everyone in the city hated him. But the he went national, and suddenly Philadelphians were like "But he's OUR unsettling nightmare fuel!"
Anna [Cyborg]: Gritty has to grow on u
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Philadelphians, Day 1 after Gritty is revealed: THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?
Philadelphians, Day 2 after Gritty is revealed: I'VE ONLY HAD GRITTY FOR ONE DAY AND IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO HIM I'D KILL EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM AND THEN MYSELF
Mark (Mad Doctor): Pretty much...
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i miss animenext
Mark (Mad Doctor): At least it was nice weather this year
Anna [Cyborg]: I love gritty and that's not even my city nor state
But I love him
