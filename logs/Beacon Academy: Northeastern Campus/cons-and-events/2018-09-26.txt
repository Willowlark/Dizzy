Jess (whoozica): WOW OK
Marisa (Weeb): u even got the tie clip 10/10

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you were like 'Mystic Messenger is for girls, Erik won't be in to it' and yet he's fucking *clutch* right there.
Jess (whoozica): DO ET
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Highkey tempted >.> I really loved it back when I did play it lol. 707 was my fave~
Marisa (Weeb): ***play the game.***

Erik (slendergiant): I will never pass up an opportunity to wear a suit ~~(usually)~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~its all Marisa's fault actually~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~entirely Marisa's fault~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~queue nothing suits me like a suit musical from HIMYM~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~way to go Marisa~~
Marisa (Weeb): i am innocent and demand to speak with my attorney
Marisa (Weeb): OH
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT MASQUERADE SKIT
Marisa (Weeb): ~~who wants to do a MM masquerade skit with that song~~
Erik (slendergiant): Only if Elizabeth III greets to wear a suit as well
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh no hes in character too
Marisa (Weeb): we could switch up the lyrics
yes. i can make a cat suit it can be done.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Omg
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Elizabeth the Thirdette
Marisa (Weeb): ``Yoosung: "What would you pick
One million cats
Or a single three-piece suit?"
Jumin: "It’s moot."
Jaehee: "What if world peace
Were within your reach … "
Jumin: "Abbadabada I’m gonna stop you right there. It’s suits. Come on, Jaehee. Get your head outta your ass."
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Beautiful.
Erik (slendergiant): YES
Marisa (Weeb): i am 100% for this as a masquerade skit at a convention if anyone wants to do it. legit. <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd have to get in line for a masquerade to see it though, that'd be like, 4 hours of my day.
Jess (whoozica): Marisa, if I have enough confidence to do a masquerade skit, you'll be the first to know
Marisa (Weeb): depends on the con but usually nah, there's always plenty of room in the back
Marisa (Weeb): **JESS U CAN DO IT**
Marisa (Weeb): the only people who care about the masquerade are the peeps in it and their friends, everyone immediately forgets it immediately
Jess (whoozica): I have been on stage like 4 times, and that was only walking
Marisa (Weeb): there u go you're prepared
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): to be fair, it *is* lip synced.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you just have to go and move.
Marisa (Weeb): ^^^
Jess (whoozica): ~~and fall off the stage~~
Marisa (Weeb): what could we replace girls with since jumin isn't into girls. cats?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You'll be fiiiine.
Jess (whoozica): He's into one (1) girl
Marisa (Weeb): i have to go on stage without glasses and i haven't fallen off yet, usually there's a barrier of speakers at the front
Jess (whoozica): Oh goody
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Almost makes me want to play.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Almost.
Marisa (Weeb): biru u can be in the skit too u can be random passerby ##
Jess (whoozica): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): driver kim
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ll be Tom.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): For the confusion.
Jess (whoozica): Tom route when
Marisa (Weeb): ok but imagine this skit
and at the end it's revealed everyone has tearaway clothes and they're wearing suits underneath <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): our points go way up. wild applause.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): or. Just do it on location somewhere.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and record for the ~~vine~~ instagram.
Marisa (Weeb): *but the wild applause*
Jess (whoozica): Rent a party hall
Jess (whoozica): A fancy one
Jess (whoozica): ~~Who got the real Jumin money~~
Marisa (Weeb): o i was gonna say the hall in my neighborhood is free to use but it isn't fancy <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 🐱
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): In all seriousness, could probably nab a lecture hall at Rutgers with some help from Georgia.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ;3c
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Knowing Princeton's door security, could probably get in there too~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~just do it in front of Georgias spiral staircase that's fancy enough~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): ;3ccc
Marisa (Weeb): have u seen the original scene? who's gonna be the taxi
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~though MM shoot in Times square would be awesome, regarding ANYC~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~november is cold~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~MC wears a sweater~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~V wears a cardigan~~
Marisa (Weeb): ^
Marisa (Weeb): seven has a hoodie
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Saeran has a leather jacket which he cannot figure out how to wear~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Jumin has a suit~~
Jess (whoozica): Seven would be the warmest, my V cardigan is thin af and MC wears a mini skirt
Marisa (Weeb): oh it looks like all the characters are wearing suits instead of their usual attire
Marisa (Weeb): ye lily and robin are in suits too
Marisa (Weeb): we all wear warm suits it's fine
Marisa (Weeb): [it's fine voice] it's fine
Erik (slendergiant): ~~I may or may not have just recorded me lip syncing the entire song and debating actually putting it up on my IGTV~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~do it~~
Jess (whoozica): The madman™
Erik (slendergiant): https://youtu.be/CiweaZQ8g5U
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://giphy.com/gifs/gq-inspiration-shia-labeouf-do-it-3o85xtLX7zCyeeWGLC
Jess (whoozica): ~~thank you posting that cuz I had not idea what we we're talking about~~
Marisa (Weeb): so ur ready for the masquerade now
Jess (whoozica): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Weeb): context is barney sleeps with every girl ever and he's constantly picking up girls. the girl in the episode he was trying to sleep with hates wall streeters/guys in suits so he started wearing casual clothing *but that's just not him* and she found out rip
Erik (slendergiant): Uploading
Marisa (Weeb): so some points would have to be changed for jumin but otherwise it excelSOMEONE JUST SNEEZED OUTSIDE AND IT WAS REALLY LOUD ANDS CARED ME
Marisa (Weeb): POST IT
Erik (slendergiant): We'll see how long it's up until instagram flags it for copyright lol
Marisa (Weeb): that's why we change the lyrics. something something parody laws that's how it works right <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (slendergiant): https://youtu.be/x_Vh9D9RDtw
Marisa (Weeb): everyone start practicing your can can kicks
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I want to sing this so bad
Marisa (Weeb): turn your dreams into memes

Erik (slendergiant): https://www.instagram.com/tv/BoLHKydgrRr/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1mglgurcot39f
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you have to play the Jumin route now.
Marisa (Weeb): you have to do this on stage now
Erik (slendergiant): I'll just read his route on the wiki
Marisa (Weeb): which version of his route <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (slendergiant): Yes
Jess (whoozica): Amazing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): this is too perfect.
Erik (slendergiant): Only had to listen to it like twice before all the lyrics came back to me. I used to sing it all the time after it came out lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OOOOOOFFFFFFUUCKINGOOOOOOFF
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's the signup for the paid konkon pumpkin shoot.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There's no one on the photographers tab.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ah, Okay, it was just created.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~it still might be pretty sad tho~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): isnt it expensive?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think so. Not sure why they're charging to begin with.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Konkon runs fine at christmas without cost.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 20 bucks.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): DX
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Who is going ?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No one.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's expensive to do any of Konkon's shoots outside the xmas one.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I also have a wedding that day~~
Erik (slendergiant): $20? I don't have ***that*** kind of money...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~expensive for those not in disposable income squad~~
snow ( karma chameleon ): its a no from me dog
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the other kon kon shoots are usually like 40+ which is kinda steep
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't remember which shoot it was, but I had looked at it and couldn't find any reason they needed to charge asides from 'snacks and a repair table'.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): RIP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hard pass, sorry konkon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): sorry not sorry more like.
snow ( karma chameleon ): maybe for 20 bucks u can yoink as many pumpkins as u can hold
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): DX WHY DID THEY DO THIS
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Pumpkins sound nice
snow ( karma chameleon ): lets carve pumpkins together heatheR
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Where is this Pumpkin event thing?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.facebook.com/events/610761569298771/
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also when is the Christmas one and where is Konkon cause I’m dying to do something I was super upset I couldn’t do the college thing. 
I’m getting hella restless and it sucks there aren’t many decent photographers around me.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Konkon Xmas is second weekend of December lol.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Konkon is the name of the group that organizes it. Xmas shoot is at Peddler's Village.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.facebook.com/events/454657101654938/?ref=br_rs
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 2 hr and 30min...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): W h y
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Why is everything so far away from where I live -___-
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, Texas is going to be worse lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah but that’s once a year and I plan in advance.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just wanna go@to something I can just be like “Hey I have a weekend free? Awesome I’m gonna go to it”
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean you mentioned moving down there.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ren faires are running run now, maybe one of those?
Jess (whoozica): i mean if you live near a city in TX theres alot to do, its not all empty
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah but there’s a hella a lot more to do down in Austin than in York... XD

Also a decent amount of cosplay peeps live in Austin and it’s hella nerdy down there.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Where I live currently sucks because there are no close events around me, and if I want to do a photo shoot I gotta travel either an hour and a half+ east or south. 

Which I wanna do but A.) nervous to ask, and B.) I gotta plan in advance since I only get every other weekend off.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): speaking of distance though, I wanna make a spread map of all of us. Not like, address level, but show each of our towns on the map.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Be cool to see.
Jess (whoozica): oh man gen, your like 3+ hrs from me 😭
Erik (slendergiant): Would also help with finding central locations
Jess (whoozica): erik, where u live?
Erik (slendergiant): Reading, PA
Jess (whoozica): ~~welp time for me too move to PA~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh Erik you aren’t too bad from me!
Jess (whoozica): JK
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m York, PA
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m an hour north of Baltimore ~~which was great before Otakon moved~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And about a half hour-45min from Lancaster
Jess (whoozica): you guys are like an hour apart 😃
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Chris is only about 40 minutes since he’s from Harrisburg
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Which is super nice TTuTT
Jess (whoozica): oooo das good!
Erik (slendergiant): I think Matt is near Harrisburg? Rebecca is in Lancaster
Jess (whoozica): lol ironic thing about the kon kon pumpkin shoot is that it actually seems to be a somewhat central location
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://drive.google.com/open?id=11nBCiUakCva1lwuUzGCrUguxRoJvutS7&usp=sharing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Progress.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and while I feel inspired, I'mma stick shoot places on it on it's own layer.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WHY YA’LL GOTTA LIVE SO FAR
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WHY DO YOU
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 💔
Evie (Katheryne Knight): BECAUSE YORK IS A BLACK HOLE AND I CAMT GET OUT
Jess (whoozica): appropriate representation
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Not until next year

Jess (whoozica): this pics are entertaining
Jess (whoozica): erik is a chinese building

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's pretty.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ONE. NICE. AREA.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I like.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s the only good area and it’s barely a block
Erik (slendergiant): Ye the Pagoda is neato
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I can attest that this pic is L I E S about York County
Erik (slendergiant): ~~it's actually Japanese style~~
Jess (whoozica): opps D:
Jess (whoozica): i apologize
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): not your fault!
Jess (whoozica): pretty sure the pic for sparta isnt even in sparta but OK GOOGLE
Jess (whoozica): it is an honest represntaion of sussex county tho, spot on there
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I mean I lived here my whole life so I see things no one sees
Matt (mattmyers25): I live in Middletown, near Hershey
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THATS WHEREBCHRIS WORKS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There' is a middletown in NJ, PA, and DE.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): CHris lives right off Progress Ave
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wild.
Erik (slendergiant): Fun fact about the Pagoda: it was sold to the City of Reading for $1
Jess (whoozica): what a bargain
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Omg
snow ( karma chameleon ): i live in narnia
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Okay, I put cons on there too because I'm a nerd.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Matt is in Middletown so yea basically Harrisburg lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Chestnut hill is literally the most central place~~
Jess (whoozica): *shudders at distance to DC from us*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~i love when i reply to something thinking its the most recent and then a flood of message come in that didnt load x.x~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There's a reason it's our long con.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Kotoricon, while small, is pretty central. Maybe it should be a group event. There's no hotel blocks or anything tho.
Jess (whoozica): ~~except when we decide 3 days before ota to go to ota~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~time to break into your old dorm~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~if you're bothered by it I'll take that signboard back~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, 20 rwby cosplayers invade the whitney center.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sounds great.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I go to the docs thing and click on my name.. I have literally *no clue* what building it is showing in that photo XDD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's whatever shows up for the town.
Jess (whoozica): Well obviously it is the esteemed Dienner's Country Restaurant
Jess (whoozica): if you click the pic, you can see other pics from the area toooo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 I had to make it bigger but nooowww I know what it is XDD Oof I haven't been to that place in yearsss but is hella good food (at least it was)
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Idk about Kotoricon I haven’t been there in like 3 years >_<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And there isn’t anywhere close to crash around that area
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *all the photos for my town are Amish stuff. ACCURATE lmfao cause that's all we got going for here tbh*
Jess (whoozica): ~~meetup at Dienner's Country Restaurant~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We haven't gone back since my senior year of college.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's too small to make the trip without the 'free' board of my college apartment.
Jess (whoozica): my first con ✨
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~maybe if it hasn't turned to shit over the past 10-15 years Jess lmfao~~
Jess (whoozica): RIP
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've never been to Kotoricon 😮
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That said, if 20 of us were going, we could theoretically try and negotiate with a local hotel...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): day con. cute. you'll be bored if you don't do stuff.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And Hershey seems to be a hot spot. Guess doing some scouting there is really worth it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And if we find some magical place between Allentown and King of Prussia, that'd be the closest universally.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~If you need other peeps locations Bill I can give you some others lol~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): mmm... I mean, people don't have to share if they don't want to? Most of us have a general knowledge of where people are but lets go with silence is they don't want to be on the map.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~though I added anyone I knew the area of, so~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Can't remember the town for Hal and Meg tho.
Jess (whoozica): ~~i think it dover~~
Erik (slendergiant): I think the DE peeps are all in Newark
Jess (whoozica): OH MAYBE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I thought Newark too.
Jess (whoozica): i know its a town that is also a town in NJ XD
Erik (slendergiant): Newark
Jess (whoozica): ye but dover and newark are both towns in NJ too so thats why i mix it up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup.
Erik (slendergiant): Oh lol xD

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sometimes a problem yes.
snow ( karma chameleon ): _i do what i want rebecca_
snow ( karma chameleon ): theres no taxes in de its where im home
Jess (whoozica): i cant believe people live inside bears
snow ( karma chameleon ): its a lifestyle
Jess (whoozica): thats gotta smell
snow ( karma chameleon ): it smells like regret
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Must be a pretty big bear for a good amount of people to live in there 🤔
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also I think Mark and Audrey are in Germantown, PA yea?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Are they? I though he said he used to live there.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷
Erik (slendergiant): Nah they used to. Not sure where they currently are
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's a mystery 👻
snow ( karma chameleon ): They’re in philly it’s fiiiiine
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Annette is Bordentown, NJ
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): In Phili: did you mean *anywhere in eastern PA?*
Jess (whoozica): NJ PERSON!

snow ( karma chameleon ): 👉😎👉
snow ( karma chameleon ): aka narnia
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ya!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So Heather is probably the most central person to everyone in BNE.
Jess (whoozica): ~~meetup in quakertown when~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So, we send Heather or Erik on a quest to find photoshoot locations in that area, and...
Jess (whoozica): lets go to the pagoda yo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I meannn I lived in Erik's area for two semesters for school. There's a couple places I can think of off the top of my head that would be nice for on location shoots~ <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I didn't realize we were part of the outliers of the group~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *Yes Pagoda is one of them lol*
Erik (slendergiant): Ye Pagoda would be great for shoots
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think I saw someone talk about shooting there on a facebook group too.
Erik (slendergiant): Gring's Mill would also be pretty good because it's just like, open park areas, nature trails, and a creek. Good outdoorsy shots
Jess (whoozica): ~~you didnt?~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao you read my mind Erik XD That was the other place I was gonna name
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It is deff a V nice park. I did some photos for a friend there once~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Added as `?` on the map.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Parks are free, which is good.
snow ( karma chameleon ): There’s a trail with waterfalls n shit on the de/pa border
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gring's Mill lacks a gazebo.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Got a cool bridge and some deer though 😛
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bridge *is* cool.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Would need cooperative weather or golden hour lighting, not much shade around there afaik from google maps.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): There's tons of shade once on the trails but yeaa as for like covering if weather is not too clear there's not much XD
Erik (slendergiant): There's plenty of trees further in
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Can rent a floor of the Pagoda for 225, 3 hours.
Erik (slendergiant): Not really worth it. The inside is nothing that special, plus it's smaller on the inside
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Even if it comes with exclusive access to a balcony?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): As well as the look out level?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Oh look there's an extra 200 bucks in fees in the agreement~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~we should shoot at letchworth~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~there's another portico on the level below that's open to the public~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I assume not that Letchworth~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~and another level below that~~
Erik (slendergiant): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yeeeee okay. I dunno how much space there is for a larger group there. I feel like it's probably small.
Erik (slendergiant): The outside is where the good shots would be anyway
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): True.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): UD is great during the summer for a cosplay meetup just so ya know ~~I think it’s UD~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Princeton is the favorite for that. ~~I swear, that place has no security what so ever~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is it a fairly small thing Erik?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If it's small enough 20 rwby cosplayers showing up would be *of note*, I'd contact the owners earlier to make sure we don't piss em off.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Example of how nice/better the outside of Pagoda is via Matt and his GF's shoot there a while back 😛 ❤
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh woops, no its letchworth village
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Figured that's what it was.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Abandoned buildings would be interesting.,
snow ( karma chameleon ): There used to be an abandoned mansion near my house ~~I threw parties at~~
snow ( karma chameleon ): They tore it down this year ;-;
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh that sounds neato 😮 But damn sucks its there no more 😦
snow ( karma chameleon ): 
snow ( karma chameleon ): It was my fave place in high school ;-;
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay but horror shoot?? That’s like a good place for a horror shoot
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did you mean: Resident Evil?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sorry, haven't been able to get on much today. Yeah, we're just outside NW Philadelphia, in Glenside, now. Some great looking venues here. Might I also suggest arboretums and/or public gardens when the weather turns nicer? I might have an inside angle on a historic home and garden near me. I'll check details.
Matt (mattmyers25): The Hotel Hershey near me is very pretty and also has Gardens with it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve got a map of potential places by me. Lots of variety, arboretums being a category.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But, by me.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I know there is some cool park near me I did unseen Toph photos at once. It has really cool rock structures in it. I'll have to see if I can dig up the name of it again though lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'll have more ideas for locations in the coming weeks. Will be doing a lot of exploring. Also I'm high key getting into videography so keep in mind I'm gonna be open to doing cosplay showcases o3o
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I want to scout Hershey. I think I can negotiate a good price for the Lodge, and it’d be cool to do a Saturday into Sunday mini con. Shoot Saturday, Saturday night, ok party at the lodge, Sunday different stuff.
Erik (slendergiant): The arboretum at the Reading Museum is also pretty for outdoorsy shots ~~and is also full of Pokéstops and gyms~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yeaa I forgot about that place. That'd be good too~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don’t think I’ve ever been to an arboretum.
Erik (slendergiant): Basically a walking path with various trees and plants that are labeled
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Right. It's just hard to picture how I'd shoot there.
Mark (Mad Doctor): We used to be members of the one next to Chestnut Hill College. It had nice variety: a Japanese garden, a log cabin, lots of fountains, a Rose garden, and so on. Search Morris Arboretum for images.  Admission used to be $10, and I'm not sure you would need special permission to shoot
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I went there with Gabe's family a few months ago
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XDD
