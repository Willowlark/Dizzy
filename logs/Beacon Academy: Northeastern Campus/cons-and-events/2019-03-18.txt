Mark (Mad Doctor): And now the Sailor Moon shoot is Saturday at 2:00. Hope it's a slow day at the law firm...
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg why is everyone choosing Saturday at 2
Georgia (Something Sensible): Weâ€™re probably gonna have to march to the park
Marisa (Mawisa): so they can all make tooth hurty jokes
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think the park is a good idea. It may take us longer to get started, but there will be less pressure to wrap up quickly
