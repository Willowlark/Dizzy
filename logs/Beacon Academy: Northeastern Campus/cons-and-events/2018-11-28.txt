Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Not sure if any of you are still interested (I think <@229713389511901185>  and maybe <@334090409389195266>  ?) But all three people who voted for my poll on Facebook for the RWBY cheer group voted to have the event on Friday lol hope that doesn't screw any plans up too badly >.<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Does anyone know where I can find an adult cheerleading costume pattern?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Iâ€™ve looked everywhere but canâ€™t find anything
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Not sure lol I'm just buying mine
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Where are you getting yours?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm getting a shirt from glittersfordinner and just buying a plain skirt cause they upped the price of the out I wanted to buy, they're a little expensive but they do free shipping, there's another site called cheerleading.com where you can create your own
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Though I'm sure there's other sites lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also what time Friday cause Iâ€™m doing a Cheongsam RWBY group and Summer that day also
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oooh cheerleading.com you say OwO
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~there is a website for making your own adult cheerleader outfit~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~DEETS BILL DEETS~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have no idea, I'm just amazed at what's on the internet.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Monica's the one who said it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~what use would I have for a cheerleadering uniform~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Did you say Cheongsam??
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I wanna do it lol
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I need to stop with the cosplans
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly idk if Iâ€™m still gonna do the Cheongsam group because A.) itâ€™s a closed group (like they wouldnâ€™t let me do Winter I have to do Neo cause I couldnâ€™t find someone to replace me) and B.) cheerleading might be more comfortable but I already committed to both groups and Iâ€™m HATING MYSELF XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): On top of STRQ that day too help
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Hmm that group sounds sketch lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Itâ€™s not I know most of the people in the group. Itâ€™s cause itâ€™s for a private shoot
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeah, I'm not a fan of closed groups like that.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Also the concensus was Friday afternoon
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just prefer doing things for fun and friends. If a shoot happens it happens but Iâ€™d rather run around im@cheerleader Winter while Jock ass Qrow is being a lil dumb birb
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And do a Cheongsam thing on my own time
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Is Chris doing Quarterback Qrow or something? XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~I want him to but fucking varsity jackets are expensive~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Oof
