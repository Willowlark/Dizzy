Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Someone is looking to do a free boudoir shoot lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ü§î tempting but if I'm going to do boudoir I think I'd want someone I know personally to do it.. just cause show of skin and such
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'll volunteer. Good way to find out if they're legit üòÖ
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Um...thanks for your offer, sir. I was actually looking for someone a little less...you."
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Guess I better get my VKS for that Taiyang shoot
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof talking about Boudoir... Monica you want to do that Raven/Salem shoot we've been joking/planning to do at Katsu??
Marisa (Weeb): You have to provide the room though <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao can do. Plus we in same room so easy peasy~
Matt (mattmyers25): <@169297844874903552> make sure the photographer doesnt move stuff like last time
Matt (mattmyers25): Lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol you right. That was highly irritating. But I'll make sure they aren't a mess like that person. Ones I'm thinking of aren't. And if they d move anything they'll be decent about it
Matt (mattmyers25): Yes lol and make sure they aren't late and go over time
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I'll put it simply this was Matt... if we do boudoir shoots we won't be using her nor will we be lettting her shoot others in our room so no worries. Most people aren't a mess like her ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
