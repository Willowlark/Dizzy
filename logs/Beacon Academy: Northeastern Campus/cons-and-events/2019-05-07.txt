Mark (Mad Doctor): Any news on a RWBY shoot at Ota? I'm going to be out of the country the two weeks before or I'd do it myself. That said, I'll be more than happy to do heavy lifting at the event itself, since we won't have a Marisa on the inside this time
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™ll be there, Georgia will probably be there....
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So fountain at two lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Do you know what day? I'm trying to figure out my line up. I think I'm only doing Neo as my RWBY cosplay this year because I have other plans
Mark (Mad Doctor): Jacques will be bacques. I'd prefer Friday but could do any time really
Georgia (Something Sensible): Probably Friday
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So she says. Weâ€™ll eventually make an event page.
