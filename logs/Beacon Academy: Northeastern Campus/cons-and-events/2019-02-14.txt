Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Donâ€™t forget your dress shoes people! ~~No reason why I bring it up. Why would you think that~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I straight up almost forgot my heels the other day. To find out I had no black ones so jacked my moms xD~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Itâ€™s easy to forget.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I do believe I am p a c k e d.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Depending on your opinion of this being a valid way to transport shoes.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 100% valid
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also valid cause fucking lights man. Idc if they stick out.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So... I somehow have 2 full suitcases, 1 large duffle bag, 1 giant grocery store tote bag, and 3 cosplays in a hanging bag
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And I'm still not 100% done packing
Jess (whoozica): What a mood
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel that Leanna. My car is half full already and I still gotta fit Matt and Snows stuff in ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I feel like I'm actually trying to.pqck my entire house into bags and take it all to katsu "just in case"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~youâ€™re actually just moving out to squat in the Gaylord~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Laptop bag, camera bag, massive duffel, and backpack. Still carry-able in one trip. <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The suv has more room according the specs, butttt Iâ€™m curious if Iâ€™m going to feel that way with con gear loaded up.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sitting through my radio class tomorrow is gonna be absolute torture D:
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Thank God for hatchback cars
Mark (Mad Doctor): To all traveling today: safe journey and I'll see you at the con!  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DSW2kysx2SU
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok <@!334090409389195266> glad I'm not the only one with an overly excessive amount of shit I'm bringing xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, since I didn't do this last year, do you guys pull up to the hotel, unload your stuff onto a luggage cart, and *then* park? Or park and just grab your shit in trips? Or how does that work
Matt (mattmyers25): all luggage is handled by bell hops. i would recommend parking and then walking your stuff in because if you need to wait for a bell hop, it may be awhile
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): mm.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): gotcha
Matt (mattmyers25): My Marriott app has reminded me today's the day
Matt (mattmyers25): 
Marisa (Mawisa): Shoutout to my three hours of sleep
Anna (loud and likely blonde): "ready when you are" *I'm not but thanks*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): After I get there and get all my stuff brought in, if anyone needs help bringing stuff in, I'm willing to help <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~at least until I have to be somewhere~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): I generally leave cosplays in the car until the day they are needed, then switch out bins in the morning. Keeps the room beater
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's smart
Erik (Red Riot Thot): most of my cosplays are kind of lumped together though. But I was thinking about running them to my car after I'm done with them to save on time when leaving
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Now I kind of wish I had packed my cosplays individually in boxes...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~now I know for Zenkai~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i wish but it was gonna be like 3x as many boxes if i did that~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oof running to the car though.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Too much effort.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): can someone. tomorrow morning help douse me in setting powder btw
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): > open jar
> start leaf blower
