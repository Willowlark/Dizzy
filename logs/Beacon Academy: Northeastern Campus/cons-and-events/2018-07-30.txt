Rebecca (madameterralupus): Delayed response but wow I literally work at a scrub store and sell those badge reel things... why did I not think about how good they'd be for con badges.. 😫
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (slendergiant): Bill's been promoting them since Zenkai? I think he was talking about them at Katsu but didn't have one iirc?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I must have missed these convos 🤷🏻‍♀️ cause I don't recall at all lmfao...
Guess imma be getting one soon though for CCE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I had the idea a year ago, I didn’t remember to actually bring the badge until... yeah, Zenkai.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I had one in my desk drawer for years man.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You can get a 5 pack for 7 bucks or so on amazon, it’s so much nicer than having yet another thing around my neck.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I'll probs get one at my work before CCE then. We got cute styled ones and I can get a discount~ :3
