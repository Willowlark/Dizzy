Mark (Mad Doctor): For those of you familiar with kotoricon, is it at the main campus of Rowan, or the Gloucester branch campus? How easy is the event to find? I'll be driving the school bus again...
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Ooof.. I think it's the Gloucester banch, but <@184437198865563648> would know for sure
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Heads up for those going ice skating tomorrow, don't forget to wear appropriate socks. If you're like me and wear little no-show socks normally, its easy to forget that and you **will** have a bad time
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wear THICC bois
Tom (tomukuncosplay): OH YEAH
Tom (tomukuncosplay): MY ANKLE FUCKING DIED LAST YEAR YO
Anna (Cadmium): yeah someone remind me to wear my ankle brace

Anna (Cadmium): Wait do you also have fallout 76 socks?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): <@!386567060026556417> Kotoricon is held on the county college Rowan bought, not Rowan‚Äôs main campus. Rowan college at Gloucester county. I haven‚Äôt been in two years, but unless things have changed there‚Äôs plenty of parking, the whole area is surround by it.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Gracias. The first convention I ever went to was a D&D convention at Rowan (back when it was Glassboro State) in 1982 when I was a wee lad of 14
Mark (Mad Doctor): People who complain about the hygiene of con goers should travel back in time to those days. Even my teenage boy self was shocked
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Rowan‚Äôs campus actually has a hotel and convention center, but there anime club there could never run a con. ~~especially now that I‚Äôm gone~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nah I got vault 111 socks and Tom has the same ones lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): They good thicc socks
Anna (Cadmium): ~~I still am amazed that RIT can run an anime convention as big as toracon is~~
Jess (whoozica): like the dye company?
Anna (Cadmium): LMAO no Rochester institute of technology
Anna (Cadmium): although honestly a dye company running a con would be awesome can you imagine how cosplay and craft oriented it would be
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yo theres a costume focused con in canada that i want to go to SO BAD
