Rebecca (madameterralupus): "Some of you may recall issues we had in the waterpark on Sunday of Colossalcon East 2018 between cosplayers, normies, and the employees caught in the middle. We did present these issues to management. Their response was apologetic. They want to make sure we know that they don't value outside guests any more than they value us. The unfortunate words and actions of a couple weekend employees, tainted the entire weekend for a lot of people, and they want to make sure that doesn't happen again. We all look forward to taking over the entirety of the sleeping rooms in the future, as one of the benefits of such, would be an almost complete lack of normies on the premises, and at the rate we've grown, that could be a reality in 2020. In order to avoid repeated issues in 2019 however, the Kalahari is committed to better informing and instructing their employees on how to handle invalid complaints from normies. We will also have an additional pre-event meeting between our staff and the Kalahari staff with a focus on this information and instruction. Together, we are also considering setting a formal end time mid-Sunday for cosplay photography to end, and they would resume a more regular atmosphere for their non-Colossalcon customers. We again apologize for what happened in 2018 and are confident that we can avoid a repeat of it in 2019. We wish you all a successful new year!" - From the CCE Facebook page about issues on Sunday this past year
Marisa (Mawisa): Oof. Their use of the word normies sounds troublesome
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was wondering about "invalid complaints". Their words or the Kalahari's? Potential for a lot of wiggle room
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This is all from CCE, that for sure.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I love the use of the word normies
