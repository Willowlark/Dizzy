Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *there was definitely a thing today in Brooklyn I saw someone in a sailor scout outfit and someone dressed like the akatsuki and someone with a todoroki wig and I MISSED IT*
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I might be able to get us access to a building that's run down, covered in Vines and plants, and not graffiti'd and actually close to a road but I gotta ask my neighbors to ask the ppl
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: For NieR stuff
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: It's just. Uh. In pawling NY
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): YO you say the word.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: So a little bit of a drive 
But lemme ask the starkdales bc it's their property

Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: BUT I may have a backup. It's just not. Next to my house ðŸ˜‚ it's farther down the road
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Does anyone know wtf is up on Twitter in Japan with the #rwbybanzai13 tag
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: It's got a lot of cosplay being posted
Mark (Mad Doctor): Nope, but it's great to see RWBY get so much love overseas.
