Rebecca (madameterralupus): Psssttt anyone wanna try to get a group together and see Incredibles 2 next Friday night?? (The 29th) ðŸ¤”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Curses I work the Saturday after so I can't be out late
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I do too but getting normal sleep and having a functional schedule doesn't seem to be in my books xD
Erik (slendergiant): I'm busy :/
Marisa (Weeb): Itâ€™s called Incredible Family here and it doesnâ€™t come out until August i cry
But if you do see it pls share unspoilery opinions pls
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): bad for epilepsy and migraine sufferers, otherwise amazing movie o3o
Erik (slendergiant): I was glad to see my movie theater posted a warning about that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH good! mine did not, i have sensitivity to strobing lights and was tense as fuck for a lot of the movie. so i'm trying to spread the word to everyone who may also me affected. BUT aside from that, it was well worth the 14 year wait. 12/10 would wait 14 years again for a movie this good.
Jess (whoozica): dang, i heard its super long, but worh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its not that long, like 2 hours
Jess (whoozica): oh ok lmao idk why i saw somewhere it was 3 hours ðŸ˜‚
Erik (slendergiant): 118 minutes
Erik (slendergiant): but damn if it was really good, I feel like 3 hours would make up for the 14 year wait
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i WISH it was 3 hours long
Georgia (Something Sensible): There's double features that play both movies is why
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I work :<
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): THAT's what it is! I had another image like this I showed Georgia earlier, I clicked on BW preset and loved the way her dress looked. Using that effect on this image I get it, it looks like *Nier Weiss*. The fabric has that Yorha look to it, and the rhinestone have the required accent.
