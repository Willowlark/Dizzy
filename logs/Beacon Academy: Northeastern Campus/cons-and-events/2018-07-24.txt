Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was looking to see when I started to click with the photography, rather than just being a guy with a camera. It was Next'16 where I started to get it, and Konkon'16 where I got used to the actual idea of being the photographer. 

Clearly, If you take a picture of Ryan, you can be a photographer.
