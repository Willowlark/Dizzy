Georgia (Something Sensible): editing a con vlog, more like take a shot for every "so" or thumbs up that appears
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wow mood
Jess (whoozica): You wanna die? ðŸ˜‚
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was gonna take a shot for every "Praise the sun!" my Arthur got. I lost the count after 18. I finally found a dude with a Dark Souls t-shirt so I could explain the reference to a very confused daughter
Jess (whoozica): Ohhhh nooo ðŸ˜­
Mark (Mad Doctor): Still glad I wore him. Far more people recognized him and shouted quotes at me. I've worn him several times before but this was his first major con experience. Totally brightened several people's day, which is a cool feeling.
Georgia (Something Sensible): +the trusty steed, i think you wouldve had less incorrect references
Georgia (Something Sensible): Arthur
Georgia (Something Sensible): also not to be a weirdo but erik singing along to the pokemon theme song is a video i think anyone could watch on repeat
