Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Lmao
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Haha not <@184437198865563648>
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Haha Dx
Erik (slendergiant): LOOK AT THAT BOOTY POP!
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Its... its bootyful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): soooo, for anyone going to colossal east and cosplaying as darling in the franxx, ethan is no longer going to CCE. SO, if anyone whos not super friendly with him wants to come to the darlifra meetup now, i'll probably be running it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): there's a yikes somewhere in there.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it's hidden behind every word
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): When's it supposed to be?
Erik (slendergiant): That Saturday (9/8) at 5pm
Erik (slendergiant): Leanna I can help co-host if you'd like. He asked me if I wanted to host but I never replied because I kinda didn't want to do it myself 😅
Erik (slendergiant): <@334090409389195266>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yee! i'd love to have help!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mm, I was just about to say the same. I know nothing of the series, but I'm good at yelling at people.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'm good at organization but im super forgetful so it'd be great to have some help
Erik (slendergiant): We could probably use a photographer because I don't think Ethan planned that far ahead
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yea, he didnt get very far
Erik (slendergiant): *if you're interested*
Erik (slendergiant): He literally invited like 6 people and that was it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is this a private shoot or a meetup?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ah, I, uh, see.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its a meetup, like a rwby shoot
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is it still 6 people?
Erik (slendergiant): yeah...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea currently lmao, he literally JUST handed over the host to me like 20 mins ago
Erik (slendergiant): I was going to advertise it through Insta for anyone else interested
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea im gonna insta post and also post it in the colossal east page on facebook
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The CCE cosplay groups are a good spot too.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): gather some interest
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Prob smart.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I planned on stowing my camera by then, but if I'm needed who am I not help? 😃
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'll just have someone hold my booze while I shoot~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): YE make a list and promo it on Insta
Georgia (Something Sensible): Maybe ask some friends to promo it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can help with the shoot some too if ya'd like. I would offer to photog but since I'm being Ichigo ... that won't work lol 😅
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEE! i'll take all the help i can get xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ive never run a shoot before
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and id like for it to run better than that katsu rwby shoot :X
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It takes a special level of dumb to have it run that way.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Don’t worry I Or Georgia would steamroll over you before letting that shitshow happen again~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Next’s RWBY shoot was bad too...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You’ll be fine. It’s really a science.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Meg and them would probs be somewhat interest too now
Erik (slendergiant): I brought it up to Meg but she hasn't responded yet
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): And the rest of the katsu group?
Erik (slendergiant): Also, there's only like a dozen characters so definitely more manageable 😅
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^true
Erik (slendergiant): I didn't bring it up to the whole group
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeeaaaah I’ve done a call list for Nier and Mystic Messenger now, they seem so incomplete compared to RWBY.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (Both RWBY and Nier are on my website Leanna, under the blog. The structure works well, groups, solos, pairings)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oooo ok thank you! thats really helpful, i'll use that as an outline
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): AND everything doesn’t has a ship name in other series! Who wants to call “YoosungxMC when you could call Electromagnetism, or “Leanna’s Fantasies”?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): did you mean bumblebee
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What’s the difference.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~actual favorite part of RWBY shoots number 15: calling topical ship names based on the people in our community~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~actual favorite part number 7: the water bottle at Neptune tradition~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Except when they YEET it
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I worry it'll hit someone
Georgia (Something Sensible): Most people are smart and roll it tho
Erik (slendergiant): *most*
Erik (slendergiant): or if they yeet a water bottle during the prop picture
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh my god that would be chaos
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): People have been very good during prop shot about not damaging stuff.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> I boosted the franxx shoot to the colossal east cosplay and social groups on Facebook. 👌🏻
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *should probably pimp Nier again tbh*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ayy thank you!!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also yes, gotta get our group happening again this year XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Only person I lost track of was Kamistry I think.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i can ask him
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sure!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I didn’t directly ping anyone cause I didn’t get to talk to everyone much while shooting.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Darla the cat was interested, Jenn is in, I think Lulu saw it?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh, chibidude saw it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lulu is in i think, she mentioned it to me a couple weeks ago
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nicu.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Always feels weird with Lulu. I stopped seeing her stories at some point, I think she blocked me from them and I was like OwO?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I never talked to her.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i know shes a minor so it might just be self preservation xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Right, which is one of the reasons I’m not going anywhere near her to being with. 😅
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats fair
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, just generally. There’s a minimum age to be making new friends with, barring circumstances like our own Audrey and Mark.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Especially with cosplay and cons.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh yea, definitely!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont talk to her unless she talks to me first, which i think is a good stance to have. which is how i heard she was interested in the nier thing again
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, exactly that.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Ye was odd she blocked you and not us,super wierd
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If we’re being frank, it’s because I’m a single guy in my mid twenties and you’re a married couple who look underage.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <:pewish:420824457918152704> <:pewish:420824457918152704> <:pewish:420824457918152704>
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Are you proud you can blend in with 16 year olds*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 😏
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Kinda yeah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~is definitely better than the alternative of looks that creep 16 year olds out~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah Tom could still order the Mac and cheese off the kids menu probably! _a valuable skill_ 😂
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Anybody can order mac and cheese of the kids menu
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): i do it all the time
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): it makes a great side dish
Erik (slendergiant): but could he get into a movie at a chil'd rate?
Jess (whoozica): no cuz toms is a Strict Rule Follower™
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): his train rides are half off
Jess (whoozica): if he breaks a rule he'll get immediately arrested
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Some places are hardcore against giving the kids meals to adults
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): lol I wouldn't know cause most places I go to have very limited options for kids meals so its not that enticing
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): I still order from the kids menu sometimes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Anyone going to Otakon
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Jess (whoozica): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Jess (whoozica): ~~pj jnpr?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~we all know that's what she wants~~
Jess (whoozica): i was brining it anyway
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also found the event for this I believe
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~in case anyone besides me, tom, Jess, and bill wanted to see tragic white haired people~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~cough~ <@!334090409389195266> and <@!386874959009415170> I complied a call list for the DtF gathering if ya'll wanna use it for the shoot. 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *See Jess, it's fun to do call lists*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I love compiling call lists or shoots for some reason xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think mostly cause it helps remind me of stuff in the series lol
