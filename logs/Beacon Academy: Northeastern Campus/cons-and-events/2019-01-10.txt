Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not worth
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don't.
Anna (Cadmium): k.
Georgia (Something Sensible): The only reason it was worth it was cause I misSED MY DEAR FRIENDS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ exactly
Georgia (Something Sensible): As a con tho, not worth
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was great seeing friends
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but the actual con

Georgia (Something Sensible): NJIT I haven’t heard any info about
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): mm, Saikou is pretty much nothing but excuse to cosplay.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Derpycon sorta sucks...
Anna (Cadmium): i have a list of minicons to go to this year. Including clovercon?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *better than geekdom*.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Saikoucon also sucks especially cause they were at a quality inn last year
Anna (Cadmium): idk i just like going to small cons to talk to ppl
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Saikou was okay the one hear I went. But kinda boring too. That was like 3-4 years ago though so idk lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): Clovercon is okay, you get bored after like 3 hours
Mark (Mad Doctor): They have a better venue this year

Georgia (Something Sensible): Birthday con 🙌
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~if I’m not imprisoned by an internship~~
Anna (Cadmium): internship good but like usually they let u take a couple days off
Georgia (Something Sensible): Best case scenario I’m at NASA in Maryland, 20 mins from DC
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I’ll be at Otakon if that’s the case
Georgia (Something Sensible): But if that fails I also applied to places like Nebraska and Texas
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, Ota run right up to your birthday. ~~used to be my birthday weekend, you thief~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ew Nebraska.
Georgia (Something Sensible): My first con was Otakon 2012 and it was my birthday weekend then 😜
Georgia (Something Sensible): “What are you doing when you turn 21” “going to a con”
Anna (Cadmium): we're going to a con and getting LIT is what you mean

Anna (Cadmium): The video of amenokitaru and his post con crying in shower is like a MOOD
Georgia (Something Sensible): I just want my own kalahari mega cup man
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bill dissuaded me from yoinking some else’s after they abandoned it last year lmao
Anna (Cadmium): WHY WOULD YOU DISCOURAGE HER
Anna (Cadmium): thats it ur late bday present is me gettin u a kalahari cup
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): only encouragement in the future
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You *literally* listened to Vincent's 15 minute rant about what he'd do to someone who took his cup again.
Anna (Cadmium): just dont be like me. and drink 2 of them back to back, and then sleep for 4 hours on a pool chair
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was there. I wanted to bail.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *He has a minigun*
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone stole it WITH HIS NAME ON IT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im going to say it every time cce comes up, but i swear to god if i get bronchitis again next year im killing everyone and then myself
Georgia (Something Sensible): These losers just LEFT theirs
Anna (Cadmium): yeah if its not engraved.
Anna (Cadmium): take it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He puts his name on it BECAUSE THEY STOLE IT WHEN HE DIDN'T.
Anna (Cadmium): also like the chick who put on my 21+ bracelet put it on so loose i could have slipped it off and gave it to someone else
Anna (Cadmium): im debating painting mine or putting those stupid wine charms on them
Georgia (Something Sensible): Why would someone leave their cup out if they cherished it that much
Anna (Cadmium): omg. thats an untapped market.
Anna (Cadmium): nerd wine charms for Colossalcons
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): kalahari cup alarm systems
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wish I could’ve left my body to watch myself do things
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like “I’m gonna go get a bagel” and running out of the room was probably hilarious
Jess (whoozica): im too much of a lightweight for those things
Jess (whoozica): they have what 6 double shots?
Jess (whoozica): 6 shots?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I just want the cup not the alcohol 😭😭😭😭
Anna (Cadmium): something like that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Do you *really* want to know.
Anna (Cadmium): why not both?
Jess (whoozica): yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i want to know~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 6 shots sounds about right.
Anna (Cadmium): idk how i drank 2 full mai tai's
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cosplay ice skating is having anime themed drinks I just remembered
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The drink is all liquor.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Question: are Kalahari cups reusable in the future?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yes.
Georgia (Something Sensible): They better be
Erik (Red Riot Thot): FUNK YES
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you bring last year's you get the same deal.
Jess (whoozica): too much for me since whenever im in a social situation with a drink (alcholic or not) i just keep drinking it till its empty
Jess (whoozica): its like a social crutch
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): mood.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Jess is wine mom
Anna (Cadmium): yes they are. 
Hence vincent's engraving
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I needed to get really drunk at CCE and I didn't.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I didn't get drunk enough at CCE~~
Anna (Cadmium): <@!351471675843411978>  if you take a kalahari cup and you fill it with wine they dont say anything
