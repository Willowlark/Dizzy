SO we skipped on rules this year. We know all are good, clean and smart peoples. Plus I roomed with all at CCE soo
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think you might need to establish grounds on what the opinion of bears with guns is

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not a democracy.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Merengue is OK Leanna
Georgia (Something Sensible): But only if both parties are wearing at least one purple item
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Plans a dad joke limit for the boys just out of torture...~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Instead of a swear jar
Georgia (Something Sensible): We gotta have an “oof” jar
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMGGGG
Rebecca (madameterralupus): As much as the people in my room say "oof" and "mood" that would be so funny
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me, going to say “oof”: “oh wow oo- OO CHILD THINGS ARE GONNA GET EASIER”
