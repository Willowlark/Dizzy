Mark (Mad Doctor): Looking ahead to Zenkai, I'm actually psyched for a convention theme for the fist time (D&D). Would anyone be down for a fantasy themed group? Perhaps a RWBY or MHA crossover? To sweeten the pot, I have suits of chainmail I'd be happy to lend...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *guess now I need to make my own dragon Kiri...*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *OR A DRAGON TAIYANG SINCE THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT HIS NAME MEANS*
Georgia (Something Sensible): WOO FANTASY MHA
Mark (Mad Doctor): Kenku Qrow?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I would do mage Ochako so much
Georgia (Something Sensible): Maybe even Momo? _maybe_
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh god no Mark.
Mark (Mad Doctor): All Knight
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): If fantasy bnha is happenin I could try tsuyu OwO I have her wig and the dress is super easy and Iâ€™ve been wanting embroidery practice

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Aizawa is just in his regular outfit ðŸ˜‚
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): With more belts and studs
Mark (Mad Doctor): Always felt he needed a big Wizzard hat
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): Jirou would be cool as an elf
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): As I buy shit as opposed to being *crafty*, I'll probably sit this idea out but I'm all for it. RWBY sounds more interesting than BNHA, but probably cause it'd be original works ~~and that'd be more work for you lot so rip.~~
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): Long ears to go with her quirk
Georgia (Something Sensible): Prince todo is my shit
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): rwby would be less work because more can be bought since itâ€™s original and can he made of random closet stuff
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ^ how you can tell I'm not *crafty*
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Shit I didn't know there was a fantasy Jirou design
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Oh no that armor is *right up my alley*
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): They got one for most of the main characters
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Denki wearing a hat is
Something
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): Off topic but what about quirk swap cosplays
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oooo denki
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): wait I still wanna cosplay La Brava aaaaaaaaa
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: *ohhhhh todoroki*
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: La Brava is adorable
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: I'd be down for RWBYDnD one day or like  fantasy RWBY
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Denki is cool. Shame.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i thought he was aoyama with the hat tho ~~oops shame me~~
Jess (whoozica): fantasy mina is so cool
Jamie (Jamie): wait is fantasy rwby my thought on summer was literal just snow white cross over type design  cause sleepy until she can return
Jamie (Jamie): but dead sleepy not the other sleepy princess
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: you dead just made me remember snow white goes sleepy
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: tho one day i wanna do RWBY but like the character references they are. so lke. One day im planning Schnee Weiss and like Ruby would be little red riding hood with silver slippers for dorothy, and then like the rest of the crew
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Goldilocks yang
Mark (Mad Doctor): ScareQrow and IronWoodsman
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: YEA 
i think u'd obvs need at least a couple people to sell the idea but it could be a fun group
Matt (lastbetatestercosplay): I'm just trying to think of how qrow could be scary
Matt (lastbetatestercosplay): Qrow is actually a grim
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: wait why would qrow have to be actually scary
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: im thinking like. just Qrow colored scarecrow from the wizard of oz movie lol
Matt (lastbetatestercosplay): This is true lol
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: you could even put the man in overalls
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: or patch his pants and put his emblem on the patches
Jamie (Jamie): im all for joining in this group
Jamie (Jamie): who would summer be in that concept then?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: I 
would love to answer that but i actually have no idea who Summer is based off of
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: OOOOOOOH Thor Nora tho??
Mark (Mad Doctor): *qrowveralls*
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: we could honestly do this just as a meetup at like some. rocky/castle location
Jamie (Jamie): yess
