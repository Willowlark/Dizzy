Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: yeet. i can honestly get to any station. (i just.... dont wanna move my car if i can get a parking spot cause sunday is a bloodbath for street parking)

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I sadly work Saturday and already have plans for Sunday ðŸ˜¦ have fun though ya'll. I shall join another time
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thinking about doing Death from Good Omens for Katsu, since he's basically Spiderman Noir with a Hemet/skull combo. Any interest in a Horsemen group?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *I saw you mark interested on that shoot*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *ha pun unintentional*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah. If only Katsu was in summer so I could die of heat exhaustion again
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): I WANNA MAKE BEEZLEBUB BECAUSE THEY HAVE A COOL HAT
Mark (Mad Doctor): I mean, I love all the Crowley and Aziraphaele cosplays out there, but there are so many cool minor characters who remain untouched
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yup. ~~most will stay that way~~
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): i'd do pestilence but i feel like their eyes are a big part of the costume and i can't wear contacts <:rip:378273525804433408>
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): *and that fly hat. it calls me. it beckons me as the utmost temptation.*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~sheâ€™s been talking about the hat for weeks she absolutely is doing Beezlebub~~
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): I dig the hat so much
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i love pollution but like. if i did the horsemen i'd want to do the biker suits
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: also, war. Giant sword. hi.
