Georgia (Something Sensible): Did anyone else have like a partially shot voice too?
Matt (mattmyers25): A little. I know I didn't want to wake up this morning
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My voice is like almost fully gone. But it's cause my allergies have been acting up all week and being outside so long just killed it more for me xD
