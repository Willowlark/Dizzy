Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I look so happy LMAO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD Schwalbe left his camera here and he has a perfect zoom in photo of that sign LOL
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need to go save Pilot boi photos.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): You should do pilot boi more, that was a cool cosplay and it's funny too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Plus I'm sure its be more fun when everyone can actually ... SEE the shot and not trapped in a hallway xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yeee
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thank.
Mark (Mad Doctor): We need to do a "Pilot boi defeats God of Light with 2% of his power" shot
Georgia (Something Sensible): omg
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Pilot boi shoot at the Air and Space museum w
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Pilot boi is shaggy now?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Lord and savior. So pretty much, yeah
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™m not the Marisa type cosplayer so ye Iâ€™ll do it again. No idea when.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Could probably scrap together enough content for a shoot with a Weiss. About it without getting into AU land.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Not that I wonâ€™t AU the fuck outta it tho.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Need access to some type of jet for cool aesthetic photos
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Remember that time Pilot Boi showed up to fly injured Yang ruby and Tai back to patch for medical treatment?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Totally happened.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'd be down for that shoot
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Tai and Pilot boi has a serious heart to heart on the flight over. Really helped Taiyang be strong for his girls.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Bless
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Was this in loops?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Lol no.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I made it up.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): I have some friends who did a shoot in the jet at the Franklin institute. There's also an air museum a few miles from me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I thought it was an actual fanfiction
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Pilot boi didnâ€™t get invoked in the loops.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was gonna ask for a link ðŸ˜‚
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™m now curious if anyone did write a Pilot boi fanfic but.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Not that Iâ€™m aware of.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _whenever we cosplay shootin in a space museum let me know because what more could a girl ask for_
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12804503/1/The-Forgotten-Hero
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If RWBY is Star Wars, is there a prequel movie called Pilot Boi showing the origin of the kinda scoundrel pilot of the good guys whose had a dark and troubled past on the streets of atlas?
Georgia (Something Sensible): are you saying pilot boi is getting his own "solo"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Pilot Boi always going to be flying solo*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I dunno if we could do more than just Pilot boi (and while youâ€™re all very kind and encouraging even with Weiss thereâ€™s not enough content for Pilot boi alone to warrant it) at the Franklin institute for RWBY but if you want to see about setting something up Mark we could try.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If anything Georgia can loan BNE her NASA wardrobe and do a NASA shoot.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If I wore it Thursday or Sunday I would have taken a few photos of yelling at people in the back of the car.
Georgia (Something Sensible): its been a while since chestnut hill, a beacon northeast event would be cool...
Mark (Mad Doctor): If we were thinking about a trip for the Marvel exhibit, we could do a side trip
Georgia (Something Sensible): could use it as an outreach to see if theres anyone worth recruiting, or at the least, hoping to become more friends with
