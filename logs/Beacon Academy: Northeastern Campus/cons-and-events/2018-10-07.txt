Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I'm dying*
Georgia (Something Sensible): _checking IDs i cannot even_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We better start *checking ids* at the rwby pj parties. You know, I'm sure all six dozen people will stop to play by the rules.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nothing says fun like "ID?"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Tbh it’s an “after dark” PJ party
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Usually that implies 18+
Evie (Katheryne Knight): like “Voice Actors After Dark” is an 18+ panel
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What are they going to be offering that's going to require an 18+ limit though?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cards against Voltron?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Assuming it's like the rwby party it's going to be in a hall way somewhere, so there's no projectors or anything, it's in public...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The worst I can imagine they'll have is cards against humanity and quite frankly I'm pretty sure that's played by minors all the time.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Dramatic readings of naughty fanfics?
Mark (Mad Doctor): And, yeah. Freshmen play Cards AH in my classroom all the time. I excuse myself, of course
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Keeping people from sneaking in after the event starts, slowing down the event start for ID checks, you want something concrete to make it worth all that work. Like, bars check Ids, but you get booze (and the bar doesn't get arrested).
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Havehou seen how roudy Voltron fans. An be? XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): not first hand, tru.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Still in public tho.
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah assuming its true to pajama party style, they cant check IDs if they're all the sitting in a hallway
Georgia (Something Sensible): now if this is a PANEL thats another thing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Georgia (Something Sensible): tho i anticipate that an 18+ attendance cap isnt good for voltron fans who probably range from 14 and up
Georgia (Something Sensible): the fact that it says "meet" seems to imply itll just be in a hallway tho so
Mark (Mad Doctor): Voltron just might be the #1 fandom of our incoming freshman, with rwby a close second
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hehe ain’t that the truth XD
I usually always say interested because Idk if plans will change
