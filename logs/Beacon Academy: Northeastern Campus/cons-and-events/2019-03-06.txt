Georgia (Something Sensible): Holy crap if you look in the zenkaikon2019 IG tag, like every line up has BNHA in it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): BNHA con lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i told Geekdom con that i didnt want to table with them this year but that i would probably attend one day to see the guests.

They offered that i could run panels if i want and still get free passes in, so if anyone has a panel theyd like to run let me know and i'll reach back out to them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have a few panels I did in the past that could work maybe? üòÆ I'll send them over when home later this evening.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i suck at panels, so basically if anyone wants to do a panel and get in to the con free i can prob arrange that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): as long as i'm  technically  "involved" in the panel LMAO
Marisa (Mawisa): I‚Äôm running an anime history panel at kogaracon I could do but is geekdom an anime con? It sounds more like a game con or a general nerd con
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its.... its a clusterfuck
Marisa (Mawisa): Nice
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): üòé
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Since it's a smaller con and most of the people attending last year seemed younger in age. The panels I've done in the past on how to start cosplaying or making friends through cosplay might be a good topic  üòÆ
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i do a recycling for cosplay panel with a fabric swap~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): I have a ‚Äúhow to host fandom events‚Äù panel
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tho Geekdom is waffle-y for me
Anna (loud and likely blonde): r we just gonna descend onto this con with like 8 panels
Georgia (Something Sensible): We ARE the programming
Anna (loud and likely blonde): georgia i need to attend that panel kthx
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i know the owner and cosplay coordinators so like we  COULD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *i mean*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BNEcon
Anna (loud and likely blonde): BNE descends upon thygeekdomcon and fixes everything
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MOOD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Honestly other than the panel you guys did last year... was there any other panels?? XD cause I didn't see like anything going on
Anna (loud and likely blonde): BNEcon just sounds like someone tried to say bacon badly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea there were panels all day
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): were they good?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but they were there
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Rip
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~tell them u can bring four different panels hosted by cosplayers~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sean is a good dude but man I wanted to see more out of the geeky dating panel
Anna (loud and likely blonde): OwO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): my friend. Runs the cosplay dating game at several cons
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol honestly yea. That seemed interesting but like... they weren't talking about what I thought
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): üëÄ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've honestly wanted to do a panel on dating somehow relating to cons/cosplay for years.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just think it'd be a fun topic lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u kno
Anna (loud and likely blonde): actually
Anna (loud and likely blonde): just a panel thats 'discussion' on it would be awesome???
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like. "Nerd dating reality"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like maybe how to date a cosplayer, finding a relationship through that and cons, etc? I think would be neat
Georgia (Something Sensible): Step 1: RESPECC
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'll sit on the side with some tea to sip
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Step 2: know there is chaos lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): just have 5 of us up there taling
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lmao Leanna xD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like not only step 1 respec. 
step 1: everyone is a nerd don't gatekeep nerds are no longer a minority
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): panel forms into just
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "how to date"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how to date: with reality check
Georgia (Something Sensible): That‚Äôs probably the sad reality of it
Georgia (Something Sensible): ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs date is it anyways‚Äù
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~ok but for a free ticket i would do it~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): ‚ÄúSo you think you can date‚Äù
Anna (loud and likely blonde): step 8: if you want a cosplay girlfriend. you gotta realize a thing. 2% of the time they look good. 98% of the time theyre covered in remnants of foam paint thread and coffee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): True
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 2% in generous
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok yeah its more like 0.8%
Anna (loud and likely blonde): "are you prepared to help with con crunch?"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We're just crafting gremlins
Anna (loud and likely blonde): "Are you prepared to actually be interested or learn some of what they do?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Are you prepared to DIE for COSPLAY
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Are you prepared for con crunch stress?!
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok maybe we really need to actually have this panel
Georgia (Something Sensible): _are you prepared for couple cosplay_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Are you prepared for them to not speak to you for a week because katsucon is coming and they are stress to the max
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~ok we need this panel~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Georgia says those words and stares into the camera knowingly for Noah. Hint hint~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Are you prepared to watch them cry over foam
Georgia (Something Sensible): YUH HUH
Anna (loud and likely blonde): "how to date in the current con scene, with discussion from todays cosplayers"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~anahahah im dragging pas into it but its awkward bc one of them is technically my characters brother but ppl ship them so OH NO~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Noah was very excited about Spider-Man and Luke Skywalker ok
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üëÄ good
Georgia (Something Sensible): It‚Äôs just the wigs he doesn‚Äôt understand
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He slowly comes to the dark side lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): have u shown him. the price of dying long hair
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And valid. I've noticed a LOT of boys don't like wigs... what is with that? XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): to be fair, its harder to hide all your little hair when you have short hair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and its uncomfy
Georgia (Something Sensible): He‚Äôs just gonna cosplay peeps he can do with brown hair probably lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Truuueee
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok but like i want short hair pls trade
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Georgia (Something Sensible): They ain‚Äôt used to hairs touchin them necks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i gotta like gel my entire head to fit in mens length wigs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof, i mean.. same like next time i do bakugo i have to gel my hair up on the back of my neck cause its too short ot go in a wig cap
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its hella annoying
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): did not think this haircut through
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i gotta shave my sideburns next time
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mood
Anna (loud and likely blonde): when u just wanna throw out the whole damn haircut
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I always have issues when I've put wigs on boys hiding their damn sideburns xD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but then u remember what a bitch it was to grow out your undercut.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): o man mood i just. concealer and eyshadow it to the right oclor
Anna (loud and likely blonde): color
Anna (loud and likely blonde): also. so like. leanna. 
what would the con actually say if u go  uhhhhh so we can bring you like 5 panels but i'd need like 8 free badges
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'll ask
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): worst they can say is no, or give me a counter offer
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~brings panels to con. gets lit after con~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like Matt gets his cut so it helps me to hide them when I put his wigs on. My ex had really dark hair though and didn't cut them so oof it was a real fucking pain to hide them üò´
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i brought them in like 10 BNE guests last year, which is more than any other cosplay ghest they had
Georgia (Something Sensible): Lie to the con and say we‚Äôre famoose
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they were like "oh shit, she has a mob"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~so like we can up that to about 15~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *Make BNE the guest*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ ye
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~this is literally just turning into BNE the convention~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i see no problems with that
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lets get a cult following
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): bill i'll even sign your arm again
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but like. omg. wait. thats memorial day weekend
Georgia (Something Sensible): _our city now_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): MONDAY OFF
Anna (loud and likely blonde): LETS GET LIT
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I‚Äôd say the whose relic is it anyway but a RWBY specific improv game at a super ~~shitty~~ mini con isn‚Äôt worth.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~to be fair if i bring my friend arielle who cosplays on long island she might cry meeting you all~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the mermaid?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I‚Äôve considered a photography panel but I‚Äôm better at like. Spouting random answers to questions than having a presentation.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lmfao no i wish
Anna (loud and likely blonde): she makes me soup sometimes tho its great
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wow ok shes even better than a mermaid then
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): soup is prime
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lol bill just do like. how to shoot cosplay tips n tricks. and make 3/4 of the panel u just answering questions
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~you don‚Äôt have to sign my arm I go to any event with friends cause lonely as fuck~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah she makes great matzoh ball soup
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I could think about it but also anyone attending at Geekdom would be like ‚Äúhow do you upskirt‚Äù and I‚Äôd have to yeet a table at them.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): start your presentation with how not to be mineta
Georgia (Something Sensible): WWE CREEPER SMACKDOWN
Anna (loud and likely blonde): sounds like we need a panel on. 'the issues with con and cosplay culture and those outside it"
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ‚ÄúI will throw this dodgeball at you if you ask me anything creepy. This is your disclaimer, you agree to this happening if you don‚Äôt leave the room immediately‚Äù
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think a bunch of skits on con ettiquette could be fun and useful. I remember seeing a funny YouTube vid on the subject
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ooooo skits
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~RWBY ask panel, hello 2000‚Äôs~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): I always enjoyed ask panels
Georgia (Something Sensible): Then cons got really strict about them
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Never went to one. Saw a tail end of a black butler one at cpac. Kinda cringey. Maybe have been that one specifically
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ask panels just. i feel are always just for cringe
Anna (loud and likely blonde): cosplay dating game panels are hysterical when u have miguel and tulio winning a date with Lord Dominator and the entire time everyone is in their character
Anna (loud and likely blonde): got to go up for one cause the host was a ruby and i was miraculously yang. 
Had banter with a mercury. was great
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh and chat noir won a date with chat noir. 
They were like. Well we gotta have one every year
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ask a cosplayer
Ask a survivor of cringe culture
ask propmakers
Georgia (Something Sensible): I‚Äôve won a dating game as Yang and Weiss before
Anna (loud and likely blonde): best girls always win
Mark (Mad Doctor): I did one as Qrow. I won a date with Poison Ivy bc they were the only member of the panel who was cosplaying a character over 15 (thank you Sean Meehan)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I was in a dating game
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Somebody won
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but I never saw her...?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~hint it was contestant #3 who happened to be a ghost pyrrha~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Zenkai schedule should be out in a few days
