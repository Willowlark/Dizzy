Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I got the confirmation email for my 2 shoots w/ my friend at Katsu... I am her first and last shoot of Friday XDD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Be sure to take note of how much more dead she is.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol. I am sure by the end of the day she will be pretty dead. You should see her on Sundays... she hella dead by then from running all weekend from shoot to shoot <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> I am always like oof girrrll!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Knoebels answered with no prints and asking what kind of costumes. <@!289944569410224129> mind just copy pastaing your description of cosplay outfit so I can send that?
Anna (Cadmium): The types of costumes we would be wearing would be essentially normal, some possibly heavily decorated with patches, one person might wear a tiara type headpiece, but otherwise normal 'fashion' or street clothes. There wouldn't be any nudity or inappropriately exposed skin, and everyone would be wearing appropriate footwear. We would all be wearing colored wigs and contacts as well, wanting to fit into the 'color' theme of color factory. All of this is apparel we are used to walking in and easily can maneuver in.
Let me know if you have any other questions!
Anna (Cadmium): There ya go
Anna (Cadmium): Probs gotta modify it but usually the issues they want to address is shoes, nudity, damage to surrounding area , mobility, and would anyone call the cops on you basically
