I've been coming with Scene's from a Hat for Whose Relic is this Anyway?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Peeps: Give it a read, if you have any you want to add to the list plz share, and if you think any of those would be hard to come up with a funny line for, point them out.
Mark (Mad Doctor): These are great!
*Odd places to hide a relic
*Rejected applicants to Salem's gang
*Worst Grimm ever
*Most cringeworthy ship
*Raven's best excuses for skipping out on her family
*What HAS Glynda been up to?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm hard pressed to get a few more schnee family ones.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Jacques jokes seem to be more anger inducing than laugh.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *holy fuck there are 50 on this list*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): What have I been doing.
Mark (Mad Doctor): *the new heir to the Schnee fortune is...
*things Jacques hides in his moustache
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *genius*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"Taiyang pickup lines"*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Pick up lines from any character are a bit.
Mark (Mad Doctor): So are we doing a panel at Zenkai?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I gotta see how well the other game ideas go lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Even at 50+ I don't think you can have whose line without a few other games.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Of course. There are a lot of other games  like "Questions" "Genre Switch" or "Film Dub" that would be easy to adapt to RWBY
Mark (Mad Doctor): Or "Props"!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Questions is rough for anyone without some improv practice. Genre switch isn't bad, though requires scene acting. Film Dub is too technical, since you need the film to dub in a panel room. Props requires the props, which is effort. 

I was leaning Party Quirks/Weird Newscasters, World's Worst, If You Know What I Mean... then Genre switch and Hollywood direciton if anyone involved is comfortable doing scenes, plus Hey you Down There.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): World's Worst prompts should be easy for RWBY, If You Know What I Mean is just Taiyang, Quirks/Newscasters only requires a list of said quirks for people to act out.
Mark (Mad Doctor): There will be props in abundance at a con...
I like Party Quirks, though. Very easy to adapt for RWBY
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'd be terrified of giving other people my prop, which the requires people with props to act. Also if it's primarily rwby cosplayers, that's just a shitton of weapons.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh right, props is done with basically two props though, not a cycling set...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You only need a handful.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Maybe a game like "Who is in Oscar's head?"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Hey You Down There would be good for that. It's the 50's instructional video where one players narrates to the other what they're supposed to do.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So, Ozpin narrating to Oscar.
Mark (Mad Doctor): What's the one where two audience members stand like mannequins, who are then posed by the players to act out a scene?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't remember the proper title...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That said I'd worry about con goers touching other con goers. (I'm assuming audience participation will be a part of this debacle, rather than having a line of preformers. I don't think BNE has any improv fans?)
Mark (Mad Doctor): I took a course ages ago
