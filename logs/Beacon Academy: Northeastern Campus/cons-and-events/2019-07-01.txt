I'm doin' photoshoots at Otakon if anyone is interested! But because of a need for money I have to charge, sorry. I'm doin' half hour shoots for $15, and $5 for any additional people (so if the shoot is of 2 people it'd be $20 for 30 minutes, I can do big groups). In return, you'll get as many edited pictures as I can take. It varies but people always get at least 8 pictures back. Also, I'm familiar with just about every anime/manga series and cartoon if that helps. ;u;

Here are some samples from older shoots, but these pictures range from this year to 2013 so they vary in quality a lot so if you're interested and you wanna know what's more recent hmu <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> Thanks for reading, give yourself a fatherly pat on the shoulder and nod approvingly at yourself.
