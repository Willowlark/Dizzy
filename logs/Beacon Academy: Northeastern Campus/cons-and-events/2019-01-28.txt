ZombieHunter: Sc #  DONUTS
Georgia (Something Sensible): In case any of y‚Äôall wanted to meet new people and eat donuts üëè
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sounds fun. I am always down to meet other photogs
Georgia (Something Sensible): She‚Äôs a nice one too, I haven‚Äôt shot with her but I‚Äôve worked with her on cosplay things
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh! I love her! Shes a super nice person and does really great photos!!
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I admire her photography too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I shot with her back when I did avas demon
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): She cool as heck
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO That sounds like a blast
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm always down for donuts
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): But did anyone dm her?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~if anything she‚Äôs been to art factory in Paterson, we can figure out how that place works via her~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): DM= Donut meeting
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh she goes with a group of bigger fashion photogs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I didn't. I don't follow her either though so ü§∑
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~no one but Leanna and Georgia does~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): She has a unique style to her shots. I‚Äôd called de saturated, it‚Äôs got a very... vintage documentary look to it.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): To have a stand out style like that is impressive.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): So Color Factory is confirmed for Feb 23rd, the Saturday after Katsu?
Anna (Cadmium): yea we just gotta buy tickets and therefore pick a time. I say 2PM so ppl farther away can get up at a normal hour but if we wanna take some other NYC pics we can pick a later time so there's daylight or whatever.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Sunset is 5:43 that day.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): 2pm will probably mean no sunlight post color factory.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *oh I've been right there before*
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): The Swiss army store is there.
Anna (Cadmium): ye so idk you wanna pick a later time and we all get there earlier for some pre-color factory photos?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): where would people want to go in NYC for non color factory photos?
Anna (Cadmium): lemme look on a map whats close i assume no one wants to ride the subway ~~although if we all fashionable a subway station shoot could be cool~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is 2pm the latest art factory time?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we could go into the city earlier and have time for phones and push the art factory time back a little too ~~if thats even an option~~
Anna (Cadmium): no latest is like 8pm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh, ok then yea why dont we push the time to like 3-4 give ourselves time to travel in then get a few photos in the city
Anna (Cadmium): how about 5PM so it gives breathing room?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we can also go to dinner after?

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Chobits, Kanon 2006, darling, ouran, nagi no asa kura
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Paw_?status=2 This is my list of *completed*. It's missing a handful because *this is already depressing enough as it is*
Marisa (Mawisa): what would we even watch in a livestream should i go for popular shows, or new shows, or classics, or more obscure gems

Marisa (Mawisa): i feel like y'all would like osomatsu-san
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~i got so wrapped up in this I got lost in class. OOPS~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *my anime list is why I didn't have friends in ~~middle~~ ~~high~~ ~~college~~ school*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): But look, now you have a TON of friends because of such things üòõ
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Somewhere in college I realized 300+ anime watched isn't exactly... conventionally attractive. <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Jess (whoozica): ive probbaly seen like 20?
Marisa (Mawisa): i answered so many anime questions on yahoo answers in middle and high school i'm still in the top 3 leaderboards for answers
Marisa (Mawisa): *JESS*
Jess (whoozica): wait no... its prob more than that
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~I've watched 92 days~~
Jess (whoozica): i forget names alot though
Marisa (Mawisa): everything is so cold and all that i know is a lie
Anna (Cadmium): we're in NOHO and greenwich village so like. if no one is opposed to taking a subway for a few stops we could also go to the 99 favor taste i like (all you can eat hotpot n kbbq) 
Its near cooper union too
Jess (whoozica): but mawisa i have already admitted my lack of anime watching to you so i cannot be blamed
Anna (Cadmium): what can of worms did i OPEN
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 344
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i cant even comprehend that
Marisa (Mawisa): i have an entire bookshelf dedicated to academic books on anime and otaku studies and i'm acquaintances with a guy who has a phd in otaku studies and he signed one of my books but the university of minnesota has a really good academic journal that i've planned on submitting to all about anime and nerd studies
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): So parks?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh I also watched *Another* and *Konosuba* and the OG *Sailor Moon* (at least most of it
Marisa (Mawisa): remember what a train wreck sailor moon crystal was when it came out lol
at least it picked itself up
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~I'm much less proud than I used to be~~
Anna (Cadmium): PHD IN OTAKU STUDIES
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): why couldn't I have been a normal person.
Anna (Cadmium): imma bring this back to the topic of color factory later
Anna (Cadmium): bc you wouldnt have met us
Marisa (Mawisa): ye one of my senior theses was on anime and later i got to talk with the phd guy it was nice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I remember when they released the promo for it. That's what got me to watch the original
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ***ANIME TALK KICK TO GENERAL***
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Cause cons planning needs happening.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): So the parks are... something, but not quite 'city' you know?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Though high rise park might be cool.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I've scouted battery park, it boring.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): washington square park might work nicely.
Anna (Cadmium): yeah i like washington square park
Anna (Cadmium): and cooper union has some good city vibes near it
Anna (Cadmium): thank u bill
i mostly know around st marks place and Stuytown where there's a lot of street art
Anna (Cadmium): i assume no one wants to go to brooklyn in this trip so we save that for another day
Anna (Cadmium): so if anyone knows things near soho, noho, or wants to go down to the pier
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I think the goal would be to stay along the C line, just so the large group of non city travellers don't feel overwhelmed.
Anna (Cadmium): i do think that subway platform shoot could be cool. wonder if we can find one that we can be on one platform and camera on the next platform and do a shoot across the tracks. probably, considering that they clear out pretty well
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Mm, that's a good idea.
Anna (Cadmium): ~~ok will save the one subway ride for the trip to food if we need~~
Anna (Cadmium): also cause. NYC subway is hella city vibes
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Ah, also thought, it's going to be *cold* still.
Anna (Cadmium): yes. 
i have never not sweated my ass off on a subway platform so
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I've wandered NYC in the winter, the cold gets to you.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Not the platform I worry about.
Anna (Cadmium): ye so less walking the better
Anna (Cadmium): although who knows with this weather its a shitshow
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): How much time do we want to spend doing shooting outside the color factory.
Anna (Cadmium): maybe an hour or two total but we could also find a cute coffee shop
Anna (Cadmium): ~~thanks gentrification~~
Anna (Cadmium): i get incredible pain in my joints when im cold so like do not use me for a human thermometer or a time limit
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): most people will appreciate less cold lol
Anna (Cadmium): yea so lets see. we want outside photos before the sun goes down
Anna (Cadmium): i might honestly go into the city early to go to the garment district btw
Anna (Cadmium): so we should probs only spend like max of 2 hours outside in the cold/less cold 
and then we got color factory, and then we go for food?
We should probs limit to one park or so
Anna (Cadmium): perhaps Washington Square park, then color factory, then subway shoot on way to hotpot?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~This place is in NY?~~
Anna (Cadmium): yea NYC
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lmao, whomst wants to let me ride with them cause I ain't about to drive there alone.~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~not me cause im taking the train~~
Anna (Cadmium): you do not wanna drive
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im doing train
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fuck driving in
Anna (Cadmium): you want to drive and take the train in
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm that would be smarter lol... ü§î
Anna (Cadmium): you will NOT find parking ~~in fuckin soho~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also if you do it would be SO MUCH MONEY
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe I'll see if someone near me is going or wants to go ~~~maybe even be outside this group~~ so I don't gotta rode train alone üòÇüòÇ cause oof anxiety
Anna (Cadmium): im coming from the complete opposite direction so idk bout yall but youre probs gonna take the PATH? i dont know jersey trains
Anna (Cadmium): ye bring em
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~maybe I'll convince Matt to come LOL~~
Anna (Cadmium): im taking the LIRR in to penn station, n taking the subway over
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): <@169297844874903552>  I plan on going, we can take the train together lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yooo let's do it! I was working on convincing Matt but he still seems skeptical üòÇ ~~he can still come though if he want.~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): üòÇüòÇ
Matt (mattmyers25): Hey now, it's more of a money issue
Matt (mattmyers25): I said I would think about it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~he said nothing of that. He was worried about what time we'd get home~~ üòùüòù
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): He's an old man, he needs his beauty sleep
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üòÇ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i feel that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This just in: Leanna's apparently an old man LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i got home at 10 last night and was like "oof thats late"
Anna (Cadmium): I Went to bed at 11 last night
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Jersey PA people want to get on NJT into penn.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Then C train south and you‚Äôre at Washington square park and or color factory.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~a mood. I passed out while dinner was cooking and idk why cause I didn't do much yesterday~~
Matt (mattmyers25): I was already thinking about getting njt into penn
Matt (mattmyers25): Never drive in new york
Anna (Cadmium): trust me.
Anna (Cadmium): 0/10
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What station should we get off at in NYC? I'd probs come from west chester. But may drive to somewhere in jersey and take jersey trains lol
Anna (Cadmium): im getting to penn station too, sadly thats not a good place for photos.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yo idk how to get anywhere from penn so im prob gonna meet up with someone whos getting off there
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i can only navigate to Brooklyn from penn tbh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~idk how to train sooo ~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): You can join up with me getting on dover.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): The ferry, while nice, doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere near these places FYI.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~we just might do that Bill lol~~
Matt (mattmyers25): Penn station. And if we are coming from sc, just take Amtrak in
Matt (mattmyers25): Downside is trying to leave nyc really late
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'll probably meet up with one of yall for the train ride just so i dont have to ride alone xD the train is borinnnnnnnnnng
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^^ Same. Glad Monica is gonna go though so that helps me. Now to figure out howmst to get there LOL. May just meet up with Bill o.o
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I think that plan makes sense Anna.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~My computer is saying Honey has a coupon for this place. If one works I'll let ya'll know~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Lol welp that sucks. Nothing worked. Fuuu~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): If we can meet at Dover train station for the 1:05 train, we'll be at washington square park around 3, that gives us time in the park, then we hop another few stops on the C train south the color factory at 5, color factory is at most two hours I suppose. That puts us done at 7, then eating would be another 2+ hours, then the train ride back will be... well past midnight.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ü§∑ Eh. Not to bad tbh.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *train ride back to dover
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Whatever your trip to THERE is is beyond that.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee idk how far Dover Train Station is to Monica's. I am mapping it now lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~2 hours. As normal lol~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): May it'd be better to shift the whole thing two hours earlier or so?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Idk who all else is coming from around that far away though lol
Anna (Cadmium): Ok yeah let's adjust time based on u jersey ppl and other ppl I'm used to my train ride
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Based more on us PA people. Oops. Why we gotta be so far away D:~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Its more the PA people yeah.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): PA squad to blame <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> LOL
Anna (Cadmium): Yeah just. Lmk what y'all wanna do we can set the time to be earlier so you can get home at a good hour
Anna (Cadmium): We can bump to 3PM?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That works?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): So train at 11:03am
