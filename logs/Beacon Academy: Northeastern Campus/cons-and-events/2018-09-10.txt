Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): well THATs going to backfire.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Were there problems?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Kalahari kicked all photographers out of the water park Sunday, around 1pm.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Didnâ€™t matter to me, all of us were too dead to cosplay.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But it got some serious backlash, because con wasnâ€™t over and con goers are supposed to be able to use the park too.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Problem came from family complaints, which I get, little kids and photographers are a y i k e s scenario but Kalahari handled it poorly since the con had just filled the hotel for the last three days.
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's just...wow. Unless they ban all cameras and cellphones, they're walking a fine line
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It was particularly dslrâ€™s.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Colossal has already told apologized and is gathering testimony to take it up with Kalahari.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Apparently they stopped letting cosplayers in shortly after too.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~thatâ€™s okay Sunday is spa day next year~~
Marisa (Weeb): whaaaaat
that's ridiculous if the con was still going on
Marisa (Weeb): sue them
Marisa (Weeb): how bad was the lighting all con
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Indoor lighting is bad at Kalahari. Weather was crap so no outdoors. Water park wave pool has big windows so that was palatable.
Marisa (Weeb): ye the videos i've seen give the place a yellow tint <:rip:378273525804433408>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I moved all my photos off the camera last night but I havenâ€™t looked at em.
Erik (slendergiant): People were also getting yelled at for using polaroids and cell phones to take pictures too
Marisa (Weeb): on all days, or just sunday?
Marisa (Weeb): I can't get on the kalahari's website to look at their regular policies <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Weeb): i guess they don't like foreign tourists
Erik (slendergiant): Just Sunday
Erik (slendergiant): But like, someone had a prop rose... a fake flower... *the ones you buy at the craft store*... and got yelled at for it being "dangerous"
Marisa (Weeb): them fake roses have thorns ðŸ‘€
Erik (slendergiant): https://twitter.com/kgari28/status/1038575271371259904
Erik (slendergiant): Oh no, imagine being at a water park and seeing people... *in bikinis*
Marisa (Weeb): she's angry at the stilettos
how dare people wear shoes at a water park that's so lewd
Erik (slendergiant): what a fucking joke xD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Sheâ€™s getting ripped in the retweets.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Props.
Erik (slendergiant): ^ can't bring those into the water park ðŸ˜‰
Jess (whoozica): I'm gonna go read all these comments to fill my morning instead of working
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm going to go on a limb and guess that this militant mom was less offended by swimwear and more offended by a gay ship photo. But that's just a theory...
Erik (slendergiant): she was offended by wearing stilettos in a pool
Erik (slendergiant): because wearing shoes is apparently more lewd than being barefoot
Erik (slendergiant): https://scontent.fagc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/41363479_1815492178486285_6661435426454110208_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=b8e1fe997fea79b50fb587106b7a2ab2&oe=5C1FDF2D
Erik (slendergiant): the memes coming out are pretty great though
Marisa (Weeb): IT GOT DELETED
Marisa (Weeb): THE TWITTER POST
Mark (Mad Doctor): Should have worn Crocs. Amirite?
Jess (whoozica): NO I WAS GONNA READ IT
Jess (whoozica): RIP
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Who knew my shrill self-righteous post would meet with mockery and anger?"
Erik (slendergiant): here were a few that I liked
Jess (whoozica): I did get to read a few before it was deleted. according to comments the kalahari TOLD them that CCE was hapeneing?
Marisa (Weeb): someone mentioned in the comments that the kalahari offered to rebook attendees ahead of time if anyone was uncomfortable with the convention happening
Jess (whoozica): a simple google search would have told them what a colossalcon event looks like and if they were uncomfortable with that then they should have rebooked
Marisa (Weeb): you can't see their shoes in the image search so it's not lewd until you see the stilettos
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That would require *super mom* to think about something rather than bitch later.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Wow this is hilarious I'm so sad that the post was deleted
Jess (whoozica): IKR?! I was gonna read that like the morning paper
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need to learn twitter so I can follow this nonsense.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This is going to update to be significantly lower when Kalahari processes the bill correctly; but for the time being.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Weekend well spent*
Erik (slendergiant): Ouch
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): it's the holds for the room charging option.
Erik (slendergiant): Still less than my Solidworks software ðŸ˜‚
Dizzy: The erik-impulse-buys count is now 6!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): !counter erik-impulse-buys add 1
Erik (slendergiant): Oh right, I made that purchase before the counter existed
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My originally idea was for Dizzy to have user stats.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If I had the time and energy to do it, I'd get to that and do it so everyone has a counter.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): > naming a potential component that converts CHIS format data into Epricer format
> CHIS2Epricer
> shorter
> C2E
>  ... C... Twice....
> CCE
Erik (slendergiant): so occasionally I have to sign Certificates of Conformance for products shipping out and from signing so many debit card receipts this weekend, my signature got v lazy ðŸ˜‚
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeeee
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Mood: Too tired to make a real instagram post with hashtags and a gallery link, so post CCE self and blame the con for laziness.
Erik (slendergiant): Isn't it typically as the quantity or duration of product or service goes up, price goes down?  Why would I book an hour long session for $75 when I could book two 30 minute sessions for $70? ðŸ¤”
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I dunno.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Sounds lucrative, time to start charging.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~not that anyone would really pay~~
Erik (slendergiant): Wonder how many other people will notice that and try to beat the system ðŸ˜‚
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's on, baby
