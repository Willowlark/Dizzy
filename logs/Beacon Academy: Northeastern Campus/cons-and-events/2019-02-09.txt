Jess (whoozica): TFW you pay for katsu, rent and home heating oil in one week <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>

Anna (loud and likely blonde): <@351471675843411978> feels why is heating oil so ESPENSIVEEE
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Cause it liquid dino juice
Anna (loud and likely blonde): It's actually liquid ancient algae juice
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): ðŸ˜®
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): I feel cheated
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): I though I've been using dino juice this whole time
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeah no it's algae
Anna (loud and likely blonde): And microorganisms
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Need anerobic environment

Jess (whoozica): I dunno ðŸ˜­ in the summer it's not so bad but winter sucks
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *is he using a call out post to advertise*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): On a scale of one to tasteless, that's a 12
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wow what the fuck
Mark (Mad Doctor): If your best advertising pitch is "I'm not a rapist" you might want to consider another career
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Whoevers still intending on color factory after katsu I'm buying my ticket soon
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Yeah I should buy mine lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): bought my ticket for 3pm.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea I plan to by mine soon. I keep forgetting lol
Marisa (Mawisa): Yâ€™all should check out this con itâ€™s being hosted at Biru and myâ€™s old university
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is that not Zenkaikon weekend?
Jess (whoozica): Yes it is ðŸ˜”
Marisa (Mawisa): WAIT FRICK IS IT
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): I knew that the 23rd sounded familiar to me
Mark (Mad Doctor): There's another small con in the Lehigh Valley that weekend. Wish there was a global calendar people could plan events on. SE PA is con-poor enough as it is without conflicts like this
Georgia (Something Sensible): CPAC and Zenkai would always clash too
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like everyone here is going to Zenkai otherwise Iâ€™d have dragged you all to help pad numbers. We know the organizer.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Apart from the neighborhood, any relationship to Kotoricon?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Not that Iâ€™m aware. They had to plan separately because ~~rowan college doesnâ€™t want to share with their buyers~~.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Why is that weekend so packed with cons ðŸ˜¢
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeee itâ€™s shit timing.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Wait I thought Zenkaikon was the 29-31st
Evie (Katheryne Knight): FUCK
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I scheduled the wrong days
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shiiiit I'll need to redo that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Matt (mattmyers25): <@351471675843411978> for katsu,if we have a high room, we should make a tiktok of you saying I'm queen of the castle or katsu
Jess (whoozica): Omg yes idk how to use too too at all though ðŸ˜‚ I don't even have the app
Mark (Mad Doctor): With a pun like that, Erik should worry about his crown.
Mark (Mad Doctor): And if our room his high in the atrium, you're welcome to use ours
Rebecca (madameterralupus): lol or we can just do a regular video too
Mark (Mad Doctor): On a similar note, I'll be dressed as Arthur on Friday. I'd love to get a short video on the village level, gazing up adoringly and saying:
"Camelot!"
"Camelot!"
"Camelot!"
"It's only a gazebo..."
Matt (mattmyers25): It's a silly place
