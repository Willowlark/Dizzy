Marisa (Mawisa): 
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Lol what is considered a large group?
Marisa (Mawisa): Like those private groups that have every single sailor scout and enemy and are sizable enough to have their own meetup
Marisa (Mawisa): One of every single homestuck or bnha character
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): large enough to block traffic.
Marisa (Mawisa): Dansu to Pantsu had their large group take a Katsu slot a few times in the past because they do big love live cosplays and do coordinated dances in front of the fountains
