Rebecca (madameterralupus): Why march... WHY
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Hhhhh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Why
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cheaper rates at the convention center, perhaps?
Mark (Mad Doctor): So despite the loss of lobby space and the weather pushing people inside, Zenkai felt like the right space for the right crowd. I felt like more people moved upstairs, though I thought the snack bar in the lobby took up valuable meet-your-froends real estate
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah. With lobby back it should be better, though march kills outdoor shooting.
Mark (Mad Doctor): And one of the things I like about Zenkai are all the great locations on the neighborhood
