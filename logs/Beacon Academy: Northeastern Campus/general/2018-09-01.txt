Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!386874959009415170> <@!334090409389195266> this show is just a bad influence for dealing with unrequited love. Pam's advice to Micheal when Holly comes back like, physically hurts. That's such bad advice.
Erik (slendergiant): Remind me what her advice was?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea I dont remember either tbh
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Holly is about to give her boyfriend and ultimatium for a ring or she's breaking up with him. Pam tells Micheal this, and says don't be sad, be patient. "No marriage formed on an ultimatum would go well right?" That's like... Just suffer, don't try and accept it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I mean, from the writing you know he's supposed to get sympathy but that's still terrible.
Erik (slendergiant): This is why I typically just don't read into things that I'm watching. I just enjoy them for what they are ðŸ˜‚
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeaaaah, I don't either, but every romantic subplot of the show involved unrequited love at this point.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My folks decided they wanted to go to peddlers village today!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Iâ€™ve never been there without cosplayers*
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): its a really nice place
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ohhh I love it there, have fun!
Mark (Mad Doctor): You want that a bunch of cosplayers show up, just to make it feel like home?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You offering?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Only if I dress as Embarrassing Dad
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh go for it. Think I haven't mentioned the teacher who cosplays with his daughter?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Can't make Peddlars Village. I have an embarrassing dad gig at Target to buy last minute school supplies
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I kinda figured. ðŸ˜›
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): We haven't made it there either.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Gotta love car shopping.
