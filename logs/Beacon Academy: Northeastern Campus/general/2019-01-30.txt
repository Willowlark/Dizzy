Jess (whoozica): *i dont know but its unsettling*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): they bumped the contrast so it's easier to see things
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it genuinely gave me a headache
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so i had to download an extension to turn it back to the original blue
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://staff.tumblr.com/post/182427728515/tumblr-is-getting-a-facelift

Marisa (Mawisa): i was just painting with that color wow
i can't escape
Jess (whoozica): ooo yea all the top thingies are neon-y too
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Tumblr REALLY wants to lose it's user base.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): personally doesn't bother me but hey, to each their own
Marisa (Mawisa): xkit guy will come to our rescue and give us an alternative. i think there might actually already be a background color changer
Jess (whoozica): he already did XD
Marisa (Mawisa): that's our boi
Anna (loud and likely blonde): didnt xkit guy get driven off the internet
Marisa (Mawisa): maybe
Marisa (Mawisa): eeeeeew
i just logged in
i don't *not* like it. but ew that's a big change.
Marisa (Mawisa): there it is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if it wasntsuch a hard contrast it would be fine, but it strains my eyes and thus makes my head hurt
Marisa (Mawisa): 1/3 of the people i follow are inactive that's so sad ðŸ˜¦
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok I switched back and I definitely liked the old one better but they *definitely* could have just brightened up the lighter blue parts

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Something about tentacle!tongue and dude just... asks to be misinterpreted.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~there are still too few girls~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): tru
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~absolutely valid~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): i love the shit out of momo but her tittyland nature makes it feel like they compensated for such a cool character with the sexy
Georgia (Something Sensible): i mean i _know her quirk but still she couldve just had a zipper or something_
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Her personality is kinda weak sauce IMO.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~tbh all the girls have weak personalities~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~or just one dimensional ones~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'd give Asui a pass, other wise true.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Asui at least DOES things.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): true
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The rest of the girls do nothing in combat and need to be saved in combat.
Georgia (Something Sensible): tsu's personality is to be laid back and kinda straightforward so ye
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Probably the most useful girl
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh ochako you beautiful failure
Georgia (Something Sensible): and momo has that whole time where shes like "todoroki validate me"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaaaaa
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): big yikes'
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): tldr BNHA girls are succ.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mood
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm not looking for typical anime class of 5 girls who love the 1 guy. Fuck that. Japan has no concept of balance in a cast. Either all girls or all guys.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like they could have had the technology to make Momo's outfit out of a self-reparing material so her creations could bust out and then her outfit heal immediately
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~author wants to draw titty~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): *they could have done anything, its anime*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~surprise~~
Marisa (Mawisa): that's why i liked the dormitory chapters, it gave minor characters a chance to shine and express their personalities
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DvCsthIU0AIO8ol.jpg
Georgia (Something Sensible): i wouldve killed for this
Erik (Red Riot Thot): More Koda and his rabbit please
Marisa (Mawisa): has anyone seen the comic where ojiro and hagakure had a kid
and deku is like "oh is your kid quirkless?"
and then she slaps him and he's like "*invisible tail*"
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): i like hagakure's sunglasses
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): Momo eventually pulling knives out of her chest is the only possible reason her outfit is so skimpy. Horikoshi give us the knives.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *continues bingeing season 3*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): me: i love pixie bob
me: you need to stop with these blonde characters
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I literally cannot leave my house.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Still snowed in.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Its time to leave work......
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Good luck!
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel bad doing homework during this lecture
Georgia (Something Sensible): but then i look up and hes like "this is a resistor!" and i learned that in high school
