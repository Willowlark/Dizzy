Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I took off that week tho.

Erik (slendergiant): If I have leftover vacation days I'm using them then
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I get Boxing Day (the 26th) off because it's a Canadian holiday and my company is canadian!
snow ( crescentbladed ): -heading to the beach rn-
Jess (whoozica): yoooooo jelly
Jess (whoozica): ive just been sitting here thinking of CCE plans all morning and attempting to read manga
Erik (slendergiant): Boss handed me this the other day. Subtract 6 fir RTX and 1 for CCE
jenna: I’m so excited for cce
Jess (whoozica): i already have my days planned out till reset (july 1 for me) and i have 3 left 😅
Erik (slendergiant): Also I learned that Boxing Day is essentially the English, Canadian, and Australian version of Black Friday
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have 9 unassigned still.
Jess (whoozica): ye
Jess (whoozica): i only get 10 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I have no week vacation planned yet, might have one in October.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 15, can carry up to 5 over.
Jess (whoozica): i have no room for a week vacay this year 😦
Erik (slendergiant): I also only get 10 but I used two already? I think one might have carried over that I didn't use last year
Jess (whoozica): but next july i get 5 more
Jess (whoozica): oo neat! mine dont carry over its like if you dont use them you lose them and they wont pay you either
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it's a while till get a I get another week.
Jess (whoozica): well yea, you havent even been there a year yet
Jess (whoozica): most places its 5 yrs
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, 5.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Just checked.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can take a 3 month sabbatical before I get 20 days vacation.
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah I think I have 3 more years till I get another week and if I'm still here by then I will be really upset
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sabbatical is unpaid, but still cool.
Jess (whoozica): is sabatical the same as leave?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just call it that for the length, it's basically a planned ahead 3 month leave ye.
Jess (whoozica): oh wow
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's a new policy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Can do it once every 3 years apparently.
Jess (whoozica): yea i wouldnt be able to do that, only way id be able to leave that long would be if i had a kid
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's a weird as heck policy tbh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I could take 3 months and do photography full time. I'd dig that.
Jess (whoozica): wow canadian companies are lit
Erik (slendergiant): Also, I love how a lot of times, this chat becomes the three of us bitching about work with occasional guest appearances by other peeps 😂
Jess (whoozica): opps
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): "We Should Have Taken Today Off" squad!
Jess (whoozica): YEET
Jess (whoozica): but then again i really couldnt
Erik (slendergiant): our customer service lady comes back from her 3 week vacation next week and I'm so happy because I'm so backed up on my own work from doing hers 😭
Jess (whoozica): oof yea thank god omg
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 3 weeks in one shot tho?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): damn.
Erik (slendergiant): she's from Columbia so she takes 3 weeks off to visit family every year
Erik (slendergiant): but I didn't think order entry would be as taxing as it is... once I finish entering stuff more start coming in 😑
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): wow. I just saw a fly actually fly into a spider web and get pulled deeper in.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, 'herp derp I'll just land here'.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Darwinism eh.
jenna: That’ll be one happy spider
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'mma take the 2 meeting from me porch I think.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Even if it's hot as *balls*.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): unrelated completely but, do not try the sonic pickle slushie...its disgusting
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Um, it's a pickle slushie.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Pickle slushie?? Who the hell thought that was a good idea? O.o
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Jess (whoozica): i love pickles but even i dont think id try that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the part that makes in unbearable is that they felt the need to ad sugar
Jess (whoozica): y tho
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): beats me
Jess (whoozica): go eat yourself a real pickle to cleanse your tongue
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im gonna have to, that was revolting
jenna: Why did u do that to yourself
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was weird and new and i wanted to try it, this was a mistake
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): dont be adventurous
jenna: LOL don’t have hope kids, that’s the lesson
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Chipmunks are adorable and my super telephoto is my best friend.
Jess (whoozica): He nom
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He so cute~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Not cute. His little cousins are eating all the tomatoes in my garden. Behind that adorable exterior lies the soul of a lvl 12 rogue
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's the squirrels.
Erik (slendergiant): The chipmunks fuck up our lawn
jenna: We have voles
Mark (Mad Doctor): We have rabbits, squirrels, Chipmunks and moles. I count them all the enemy. And don't get me started on those blueberry stealing birds.  Young punks...get off my lawn!
