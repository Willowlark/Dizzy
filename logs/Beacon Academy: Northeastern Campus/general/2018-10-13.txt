Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So my boss got a really sick burn out on me today
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): and it was just respect
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): cause she was telling somebody who was taking over my training that I seemed like a "taller, something else, cooler version of her "
And I was like "idk about that last part, I cosplay, and we cosplayers call ourselves trash"
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): and there was a little laughter good banter
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): but then she comment about something else
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): and was like "and after that you can put it in the trash"
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): _"with the cosplayers"_
Mak (hollyjollymak): Halim I love you and I love this story but looking at your icon and seeing the words 'cooler version of her' in this story is just
Such a disconnect in my brain
Mak (hollyjollymak): DFL;ADS;L;LDF;SDF **WITH THE COSPLAYERS**
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I WAS LIKE DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN JESSE
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): You got me Goooodo
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): also yes 
dinosaur head RTX boi is clearly the coolest version of anybody
Mak (hollyjollymak): Chriiiiiist
I mean it's a Look but
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg I went to my first college sports game
Georgia (Something Sensible): FINALLY
Georgia (Something Sensible): As a JUNIOR phew
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): What sparked that decision lol?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also <@!386567060026556417> I know it‚Äôs early, but I realized this today because i saw a father and his daughter on a bus tour. If y‚Äôall are starting early and Audrey is looking at colleges, I‚Äôd be happy to show y‚Äôall around Rutgers!
Georgia (Something Sensible): I did physics all day (I did GRE prep for physics after my midterm, end me) so I deserved to chill
Georgia (Something Sensible): The bois and I went to the game and then the diner
Marisa (Weeb): This is honestly one of the most ominous things I‚Äôve ever seen
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Whatttttttttt the hell is that
Mark (Mad Doctor): A warning to other robots?
Mark (Mad Doctor): And <@245270932602486784>, thank you for the offer, but Audrey has a way to go before she starts looking seriously at colleges. We're still in the "poke around if we find ourselves on a college campus" stage. She's amazed that there are whole buildings (and schools) dedicated to art
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah of course! I remember running around like a headless chicken with my parents like ‚Äúwhat IS college‚Äù, so I figured I‚Äôd make the offer to save you guys some possible confusion lol
Erik (slendergiant): <@184437198865563648> I forgot to mention,  add two impulse buys to the counter for Forza *and* the James Bond car pack DLC üòÖ
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Only for the car pack lol
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Lmao the car pack omg
Dizzy: The erik-impulse-buys count is now 9!
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): !counter erik-impulse-buys add 1
Erik (slendergiant): The graphics in this game are gorgeous btw
Erik (slendergiant): Can't wait till I can get a 4k TV to make it look even better
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah forzas always been one for accurate car graphics üëå
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Good stuff
Erik (slendergiant): And even like, the scenery too
ZombieHunter: My friend‚Äôs parents like to low key roast him.
ZombieHunter:
