Mark (Mad Doctor): Just finished "The Secret History of Wonder Woman". I recommend it to anyone who likes pop history. The central character had close ties to the suffrage movement, invented the lie detector test, lived in a polyamorous relationship, and was into BDSM. All found their way into his comic.
