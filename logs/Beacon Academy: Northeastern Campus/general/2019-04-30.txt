ZombieHunter: I’m an advertisement
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: u look like you're questioning every decision in life up till that moment
ZombieHunter: Lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Marvel Characters as D&D classes GO!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is what I came up with. Missing some characters probably and these are up for interpretation
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hard at work I see.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): you know it <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Evening event at katsu is us trying to play a mini campaign with our marvel character
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lets just D&D Larp
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There’s one across the street from tech.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i know, i want to go
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ive wanted to go since high school
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I know nothing about it other than it’s held at like, a Girl Scout camp.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Anyone ever play Mutants and Masterminds? It's a really good DnD adaptation for supers.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I did a long time ago. What a trip.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's independent though iirc, not a D&D variant?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Point build system
Mark (Mad Doctor): It was based on the 3e open license, so it shares a lot of concepts. Somehow I found it easier to role play the depths of a character in that genre
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): This looks like a fever dream
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FvvZaBf9QQI
Erik (Red Riot Thot): look what fixing his eyes could have done
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): And making his shoes bigger/not using it as a chance for product placement
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): ||Jim Carry is a thin Eggman because he’ll become the fat eggman during the final battle as a setup to a sequel||
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Holy shit that shouldn’t have been made.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did no one tell them he looks like a thing of nightmares?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Head too big.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Body thin.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Am.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oof.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ||I agree Marisa. Then they'll be able to bring in the whole gang. Can't wait to see cryptid Knuckles||
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *FeEEEAAARRRRrRrR
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): ||Tails crashing his plane somewhere in a dramatic military scene and sonic has to bust him out of quarantine||
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yo I get transformers vibes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, aliens. Military gets antsy. Teenager saves day with aliens.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's like the same movie.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): It’s laser team but sonic is the laser team
Jamie (Jamie): Okay but its the people who did fast and the furious making it???
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): they like fast things apparently
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): and making their fans furious
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
