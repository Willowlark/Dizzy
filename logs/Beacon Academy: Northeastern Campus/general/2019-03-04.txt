Chris Onyx: <@386874959009415170> What kind of paint did you use to paint the little keychains you gave us?
It covers the print lines amazing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Acrylic paint! I think for the main black bits it was one or two layers and then the colored bits were at least like, 4. Then finished off with 2-3 coats of clear coat
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I don't use tumblr but.

it is infinitely more fun to tag #randomcompletethoughtsthathavenoothertags than things like #bird or #cosplay.
Marisa (Mawisa): tumblr tags are just ways we yell at each other discreetly
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay hear me out

New game idea: Yandere simulator battle royal called "Notice Me Senpai"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im here for it
Marisa (Mawisa): like a fighting game with all the rival characters?
Marisa (Mawisa): i'd main oka and amai
Evie (Katheryne Knight): No like a Fortnite/pubg/Apex style battle royal with a make your own Yandere
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sign me the fuck up Evie xD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just need game designers
Marisa (Mawisa): :0
oooo
ask yandere dev when he finished yandere simulator!
Marisa (Mawisa): that might take another 20 years tho
we find someone
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I'm having a mild crisis i used to draw so much and be known as a person who could do art and I haven't??? Drawn in so long??? No one I talk to now knows that I can draw/do arts ???  I feel like I lost part of my identity. 
Rip I gotta draw some fanart now
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~someone explain exactly what a yandere is. am fake weeb~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): She love you sooooo much... she'd rather see you dead than with anyone else.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Basically Toga
Erik (Red Riot Thot): perfect explanation and example
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i am a horrid student
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but I am an incredibly resourceful human being
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I maximize my lazy potential like no other
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Pro-crastinator
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea a yandere is a chick who is crazy in love with whoever their crush is, would murder/ do other violent acts for them and to be with them. Toga Himiko and Yuno Gasai are good examples.
Jess (whoozica): wait is it only girls?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm sure there could be yandere guys too. I just haven't seen any in media?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~at least that I know of lol.~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yandere guys exist
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~After a look yes there is. I just don't know what any of them are from lol~~
Jess (whoozica): *my bloody valentine by good charlotte lays in the background*
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: But since most popular anime is male oriented, (for example my hero is told from dekus stand point) 
Most love interests are female, so most popular dere's are female
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^Yeee
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its also 100% the result of a mostly male fantasy, like most of the dere archetypes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I am sure there are also male tsundere's I just don't know any off the top of my head. I've mostly seen females.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: If you look at female oriented manga/anime, you  can definitely find male equivalents of the female deres
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but they're usually not as intense
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: like you have a tsundere boi, but he isn't nearly as intensely tsun as the female counterpart
Jess (whoozica): ye
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea cause the list of yandere and tsundere boys I am finding I ma like eh? I don't fully see it but I guess. SO yea, I think female -deres are deff more intense than the males.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Mikaela from Seraph of the End is actually a really good male yandere example
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Creed from black cat
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Shuu from tokyo ghoul
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm.. yee I can kinda see Mika being a Yandere üòÆ
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Lol Creed is something.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: side note, yanderes don't have to be romantic either 
Its loving somebody to the point of not letting them have anyone else
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: a lot of sibling-esque types have the same kinda of vibe
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i mean theres usually a creepy romantic vibe to it still but
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Trueee
Mark (Mad Doctor): Having put up with a lot of romantic bullshit in my time, I am puzzled by the popularity of "dere" types.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: 3 words
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: young male fantasy
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and then it just becomes a tv trope
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and everybody lovesss
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: tropes
Mark (Mad Doctor): I s'pose.  That said, I kinda want to play Evie's game
Marisa (Mawisa): there‚Äôs a ton of male tsundere. One in every otome game/anime/manga. They‚Äôre usually tough guys.
Marisa (Mawisa): Kyo from Fruits Basket
Marisa (Mawisa): A little bit Ed from FMA with winry but he kind of gets over it as he ages
Anna (loud and likely blonde): did you mean how everyone on AO3 writes bakugo
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah male tsundere is everywhere
Anna (loud and likely blonde): it honestly gets exhausting when its overdone but like. i can appreciate it
Chris Onyx: <@288513265661902858>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I want a male Himedere
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~oh wait that's Gilgamesh shit~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Take back what I said XD
Chris Onyx: Lmaoo
Chris Onyx: Gilgamesh gives off Jacque Schnee vibes
Chris Onyx: Also
Gilgamesh 100% has the GoldenPeen‚Ñ¢
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Who's gilgamesh fam
Chris Onyx: One of the servants from Fate: Zero
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH OK THANK
