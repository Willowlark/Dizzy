Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Ok you should have it now
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): HAHAHAHAA IT'S AN OFFICIAL NIKON PRODUCT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "i've got you in my sights"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well foo. So Nikon (my brand of choice, if you've never looked at my gear) just announced it's mirrorless camera flagship. Small, all electronic, no mirrors. While the new cameras have a couple cool new things, the important part is that they created a new lens mount for them, the Z mount. 

Now, I have lenses with F mount. There were rumors circulating that they'd be making an adaptor so *every photographer ever* would still be able to use their lenses. They did make an adaptor, but.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's only F to Z.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So I'll never be able to use Z mount lenses on my F mount camera, and jury is out on if there will even be new F mounts.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and both the Z6 and Z7 new cameras are 3 to 4 thousand dollars.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Even if I wanted to go mirrorless (I don't need a smaller camera I have large hands, and last time I used an electronic viewfinder it gave me a head ache) I sure as hell don't want to do *that* price point.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Yeah, that really sucks 😕
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): !!!!!!!!!!!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): NIiiiiiiiiceeeeeee
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Since literally only Sony made them before, and my camera uses em.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also announced a f/0.95 aperture lens. That is one of the lowest fstops ever.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Talk about blur.
