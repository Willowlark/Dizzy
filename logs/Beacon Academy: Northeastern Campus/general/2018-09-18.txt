Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👀
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ok so I’m scrolling through tumblr and someone reposted this official art
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): So obviously I focus on bakuhoe
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And I thought it was really weird that he was drawn wearing that shirt because he’s always drawn wearing either all black or another dark solid color
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And then I realized I’d seen that shirt before
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): THEY FUCKING SHARE CLOTHES
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH MY GOD

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): *squeals with excitement*
Marisa (Weeb): does anyone even like mineta
they keep making merchandise for him but. it's mineta.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Like 2% of the fandom does
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I don’t hate him but he’s not important to me
Marisa (Weeb): i heard there was a bnha meetup a couple years ago where a mineta cosplayer was bullied out of the photoshoot and asked to leave (not because of his behavior but just because he was dressed as mineta) which is messed up
Erik (slendergiant): I don't like the character, but that's FUCKING messed
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That 100% happened
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Witch is so upsetting I’m so many levels
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): people high key hate on mineta and people who cosplay him
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YET DENKI AND KAMI ARE RIGHT THERE WIH HIM PULLING ALL HOS SHITTY SCEMES BUT NO ONE HATES ON THEM
Erik (slendergiant): that's really upsetting that people do that shit. honestly
Erik (slendergiant): just let people have fun
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): it pisses me off so much 
~~Because even if he's disgusting personality wise, the only reason they hate him is his appearance design isn't attractive~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~diaper grape boi~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~its really bad ngl~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~but that doesn't excuse the double standard~~
Marisa (Weeb): it did really happen?? oh nooo
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Akrcosplau is planning a lewd mineta look and I am LIVING for it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): lol wat
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Akrcosplay*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): a lewd mineta
Erik (slendergiant): good lord
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Correct
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): that sounds hilarious
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m so fucking ready for it
Marisa (Weeb): in this image we have bakugo carrying a plank, and even though it's out of frame in this picture we see kirishima cutting a plank with a saw
Marisa (Weeb): 
Marisa (Weeb): this is a euphemism for boyfriends. in this essay i will expl
Erik (slendergiant): ~~Kiri handling Baku's wood~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Sometimes ya just gatta saw your friends plank
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): DO YALL KNOW ABOUT THE JACKET FROM THE CULTURAL FESTIVAL THAT BAKU GAVE KIRI
Marisa (Weeb): OwO wuzzat
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): So they released a bunch of art of all class 1-A at a cultural festival. Each character had their own card with a specific outfit and a little blurb about them and what they did that the festival.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): yes
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): This is the English translation of kiribakus
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 
Marisa (Weeb): OR...?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): OR HIS BOYFRIEND GAVE IT TO HIM
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): HE GAVE HIS BOYFRIEND A JACKET TO KEEP HIM WARM OK
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): BECAUSE KIRI IS ALLERGIC TO SHIRTS OR SOMETHING
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IT MAKES IT REAL HARD TO COSPLAY HIM
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): LOOK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ~~Gay~~ MANLY MEN NEED TO BE SHIRTLESS ~~to attract other 'manly' men~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): HOS INTERESTS ARE MANLY MAN AND MEAT
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): MANLY MAN MEAT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ooof yea the character isn't great but just cause someone cosplays him doesn't mean you should bully said person.. like damn
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IM SORRY BUT THEIR IS NOTHING HETERO ABOUT THAT
Marisa (Weeb): could attempt open shirt binding for a short amount of time
Marisa (Weeb): cuz it gets a bit painful
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I plan to! I just gatta learn how 😅
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): If anyone has any advice on binding or good binders pls let me know!
Erik (slendergiant): https://tenor.com/view/seal-gay-gif-3465935
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ I second that Meg on binding. I'd love to know too lol. Cause oof
Marisa (Weeb): for open shirt binding, sports tape and duct tape, and then some makeup to contour sick abs on your chest.  a friend would help if you aren't embarassed because the tape will go around to your back and possibly cover your whole back depending on how you do it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): binding things can get painful
Erik (slendergiant): *"sick abs"*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I know it can be painful and damaging if done the wrong way so I wanna do research into it before I do anything.
Marisa (Weeb): the duct tape wouldn't be going on your skin it'd go over the medical tape but there are other ways you can do it without duct tape too
i got a regular binder off amazon a few years back that's perfect for me but also i'm a washboard. there are a lot of good references in the ftm community on tumblr about binders.
Marisa (Weeb): alternatively, get one of these bad boys
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Lol 😂 those things are hilarious
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’ve been working out more so I’m trying to get stronk 💪🏻 for my manly man gym rat
Marisa (Weeb): get shredded quick by using bra inserts and a sock
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Is that a fake penis reference???
Marisa (Weeb): ***no***
Marisa (Weeb): w h a t
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m so confused
Marisa (Weeb): you do this
and then put a skin colored sock over it
bam muscles
Marisa (Weeb): small picture but here's what that guy looked like in costume. there are better examples but i can't find them
Marisa (Weeb): here's a good video of it in action and a tutorial
https://mistiqartscosplay.tumblr.com/post/170608135029/after-a-full-year-my-zarya-is-finally-done-it
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): OK THAT MAKES MORE SENSE
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): #sorrynotsorry
Erik (slendergiant): I've been lowkey considering finally joining a gym and doing more exercise
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I should exercise more
Erik (slendergiant): Especially after CCE and seeing myself shirtless I'm just like *yikes*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I said when school started I was gonna go to the gym after class and work out... we are three weeks in.. I have gone 0 times... oops
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And Erik hush! You look fine >:o
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): There’s a gym in my community less then a mile from my house (that’s empty 95% of the time) I literally don’t have an excuse
Erik (slendergiant): Like, this picture specifically I look like I'm a few months pregananant with Will's child
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): YANG IMPREGNATED BLAKE
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): MPREG UP IN HERE
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): you don't look like that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sir you look fine!! Have you seen me in half the photos?! XD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): but since you said it and the context of the cosplay I had to react
Erik (slendergiant): But like, my metabolism is finally catching up with me...
Erik (slendergiant): I also want to bulk up my arms because I'm weak as shit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I literally look like Im fucking preggo here... like oof... D:
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Bruh shut the fuck up
Erik (slendergiant): Bigger arms and a toned tummy is what I'm aiming for 👌🏻
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Don’t forget leg day, the bellabooty is important
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): get in those squats
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): One time I was drunk and sad that I don’t have a yoko booty so I drunkenly did 350 squats at 3am
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I could barely walk the next day when I woke up
Marisa (Weeb): *what*
that's leg massacre
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): damn son
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 350??
Erik (slendergiant): Meg what the fuck 😂
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I NEVER SAID IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
Marisa (Weeb): i left after the mpreg comment but *what*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Erik: > Says he's weak
me: Then what the fuck is this in one of our Black Sun photos?! 😂 😂 BOI
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Weak as shit my ass sir
Erik (slendergiant): THAT IS A TRICK OF LIGHTING BUT YEAH I THOUGHT IT LOOKED HELLA LIT

Erik (slendergiant): Thanks friendos! 💕
snow ( karma chameleon ): Y’all are heckin BOOTYFUL
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If anyone wants a tablet, Amazon is selling the fire tablets dirt cheap. 35 for 7" and 110 for 10".
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not a lot of storage, but 35 bucks is nothing for a tablet.
Erik (slendergiant): That's why microSD cards exist 👌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's exactly what the deal summary said.
Jess (whoozica): Is it "with special offers"?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): intruiging
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Both are discounted.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it's 50 for the 7 without the ads.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fire tv dongles are 40 too, which is apparently as low as they've ever been.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tablets are great for fanfiction!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Not saying I got my ipad mini for fanfiction but~~
Erik (slendergiant): I'm guessing you have Prime? Because those are the Prime prices
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's a prime deal.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ...need a hook up?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I have student prime until December 👌🏻
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): lucky you.
Erik (slendergiant): I have 2 tablets already (3 if you count my laptop's tablet mode?), don't need another lol
Erik (slendergiant): But I honestly should subscribe to Prime. I use Amazon enough as it is
Erik (slendergiant): I accidentally subscribed to Prime when I was in college and it wasn't even the student version 😣
Erik (slendergiant): Remember to cancel your free trials folks
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've definitely made up for the membership cost in shipping savings.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): lol Erik that just happened to me with Microsoft Office because I'm stupid
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): $105 dollars down the drain
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): although I technically need it for school, and have a few thousand saved specifically for school so I was able to take it out of there
Erik (slendergiant): Also, while we're on the topic of Amazon, y'all should consider using smile.amazon.com because you can choose a charity and it'll donate 0.5% of the price of your order to that charity
Erik (slendergiant): It's not a lot (I've been using it for a few months and only generated $2.32) but it's more than not donating at all!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I signed up for it a while ago but honestly I don't use Amazon a lot
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Etsy is where its at lol

Erik (slendergiant): ~~I have a coupon you can use too~~
