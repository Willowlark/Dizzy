Georgia (Something Sensible): writing is easy A tho!
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~for me~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Shocking number of jobs available for technical writers though. The people I know who did it claimed it was chew-your-own-leg-off boring
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): As long as you don't copy and paste a wikipedia article you can get an A on paper. XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Writing them is BORING and time consuming.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's the hard part.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Tell that to my students. I had to have a 45 minute meeting to explain to a student why her six pages of word salad warranted a C
Georgia (Something Sensible): _word salad_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oof.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don't fluff a paper you don't have to.
Mark (Mad Doctor): We use an online note taking tool. This girl literally grouped six of her note cards and wrote them into a paragraph in random order. She had no idea how the ideas related to each other
Mark (Mad Doctor): But let me give you a B+ to get your parents off your ass and mine
Georgia (Something Sensible): Writing is so important
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause communication is important
Georgia (Something Sensible): There’s a lot of smart people who lose out on funding cause they can’t dumb down their ideas so rich normies can fund them
Georgia (Something Sensible): Plus you could cure cancer but if you dont know how to explain how you did it, it makes it significantly hard for others to replicate
Mark (Mad Doctor): Death Ray: A Ray that Causes Death
Any questions?
Anna (blonde and sad): "what does death mean?"
Anna (blonde and sad): theres a huge problem of academic jargon and prose making education/knowledge inaccessable to people.
Anna (blonde and sad): so i am glad that our generation is trying to break down those barriers
Anna (blonde and sad): but seriously like you shouldnt have to have a masters for a doctor or someone whos talking to you to explain whats going on
Anna (blonde and sad): if you cant explain what youre doing to a  person who doesn't understand your work, you're doing a terrible job explaining it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You are correct Georgia.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s still annoying though.
Anna (blonde and sad): that was a total word salad on my part sorry
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ugh, I had a student find a gender studies paper for her research project. The jargon was impenetrable to me, with a bajillion years of education, let alone to a high school freshman
Anna (blonde and sad): proof she either had someone else write it or she put every word into a thesaurus
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg I feadass had a professor go “we use p-p collisions to use QED for evidence of QGP in regards to quark pairs”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I was like _english please_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *if you don’t speak in acronyms are you even in the sciences* <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Georgia (Something Sensible): I love seein everyone’s siblings today
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s wild seeing how much everyone has a little doppelgänger/genderbent doppelgänger
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you think that about Katy I’m taking you to get your eyes checked.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah everyone looks similar to their sibling! It only makes sense, siblings share DNA
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Georgia.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You’ve seen Katy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Her friends in high school didn’t realize we were related until they came to the house and saw me in my bedroom.
Anna (blonde and sad): maybe georgia is just rlly good at spying the similarities in ppl
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yaaaa
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yall look similar
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): However two very different personalities  from what I  remember
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~it disappoints me I have no better pictures of her as a photographer~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My sister is a normie.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Likes fashion. And makeup.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Netflix?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Who doesnt like Netflix
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We get along fine, but our common interests are far and few.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I mean like, can Netflix be you primary hobby? That allowed?~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): You and Katy have predominantly the same eyes and nose shape
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Side by side.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _eyes and nose_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ye agreed
Georgia (Something Sensible): Probably mouth and facial structure too but the eyes are the biggest commonality to me
Jess (whoozica): You guys look alike for sure
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like my sisters and I all have small eyes
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cheeks too
Georgia (Something Sensible): Our noses are different tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~don’t pay that photographer~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m just saying. Her friends LITERALLY thought I was some random guy she was calling to across the lunchroom.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _it was my cousins wedding_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~and~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Chin. Y’all have the same chin.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Naaaaah you and Katy are pretty easily siblings
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Congrats then, cause 9/10 people do not assume that.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _everyone show me your siblings we’re doing this for science_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): To that one squicky time we bought moms birthday present together and got dinner after and the hostess said “she should keep me around cause I buy Micheal kors”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m not crazy here, this has gone on for a longggg time. XD
Jess (whoozica): My brother looks like genderbent me
Jess (whoozica): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mmmmm yeah
Georgia (Something Sensible): The mouth and nose is most obvious
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeeee
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I dunno. I see it in the eyes. Color ain’t the same but shape.
Jess (whoozica): We were comparing birth pic and i was like "this just looks like the same kid twice"
Jess (whoozica): Oue noses are the same too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Do the office meme for the same picture.
Jess (whoozica): Our eyes are pm the same color too tho ut just does look like it cuz of my makeup prob
Anna (blonde and sad): Wow Jess yeah that is just taller genderbend you
Jess (whoozica): Yup! He used to call me ugly and be like "bitch u ugly too"
Georgia (Something Sensible): i wish I had a brother so I knew what I looked like as a boi
Anna (blonde and sad): I'm tryna find a pic of my brother with me but I have none apparently
Anna (blonde and sad): 
Anna (blonde and sad): He's like 4" taller than me I'm jealous
Jess (whoozica): YE you guys look alike!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh I sorta see it yeah.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _holy crap you look so alike_
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestly put him in a yang wig and it would take a second for me to register
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): My brother an I are literally just the same person
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Same personality
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Same face. Almost
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Hes just taller
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Which is unfair
Jess (whoozica): "Watch your children"

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yee. My mom and dad are around average height. His dad is around 6ft lol. 
And lol yea XD My dad holds the dog weird a lot
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've been told I resemble my dad more than my mom overall but apparntly they say my face is split from like nose down is dad, nose up is her lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is so neat to look at everyone's siblings! I often forget some of you have siblings nor have I ever seen some of them so I'm like ooohhh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh same!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I forget you have a brother a lot, I forget Bill has a sister and that Georgia has more than 1 sibling XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Georgia's really threw me off cause Im like what there's more than 1 sibling? 😮 And then remembered lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I forget Georgia has sisters until I'm at her house and a smaller version of Georgia is there
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And I'm just <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351> <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They. look similar.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've only ever seen 1 in person so seeing this other I'm like <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Lmao that’s what everyone says, it’s me, medium georgia, and small georgia
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It's like goldilocks and the three ~~bears~~ sisters
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The third I swear is a ghost cause I've never seen her.. unless I have and I thought it was the middle XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lmao Leanna
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, I don't mistake Georgia for Lily or Katy (not sure which spelling she go by).
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But the smols are all smols to me.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Kate is taller than me so she’s ironically small Georgia cause she’s the youngest
Georgia (Something Sensible): She’s also a gremlin yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Did you just call your youngest sister your own name
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Who all is the youngest and who is the oldest sibling? 😮
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I be younger sibling
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm old.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Vacuo apparently
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Natalie Dormer is a Crocs supporter (as is Zooey Deschanel). Your argument against Crocs is invalid

Mark (Mad Doctor): I don't care how sexy the bunny is. Lebron does not have the charisma to take over the Michael Jordan role
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👏 I've been really productive the past few days and I am so happy and pleased with myself. Usually I am dragging behind and putting things off but I am actually kind of ahead in some homework at the moment. Yeet! ~~For sure thought that my car having issues would put a big stake in me getting stuff done but nope!~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GOOD JOB you are doing amazing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I have/had 2 hours until I meet my friend so working on my assignments for radio next week. So I am not waiting till last minute to find a damn story to report on lol
