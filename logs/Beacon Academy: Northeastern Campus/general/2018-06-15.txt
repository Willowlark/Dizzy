Man I'm a clutz today.
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's just mean
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Better than not telling him, and having him pay full price down the line.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): B o i
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/Rjsc07KHN1C36
Erik (slendergiant): although the one I've been looking at is cheaper and has a larger print volume...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I didn't say they were good, just on sale. 😃
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Always do research on big purchases.
Erik (slendergiant): but thanks for ~~instigating my impulsive buying~~ thinking of me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Look I’m about to impulse buy cosplay 

Treat yo self
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ same!!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Shot
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): _looks around for something to impulse buy*_
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I’m about to do a Fem!Akira/Ren from Persona 5
Erik (slendergiant): I should actually really buy my Goro cosplay because chances are it's going to be coming from China and I'm going to need time to adjust it...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay every time you say Goro I think Akechi from P5
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I’m in Persona 5 hell right now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa you may wanna do that Erik xD I just ordered a wig for my one costume from China and it's not getting here till end of this month-July 20 .-.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Soon you but the better, don't wanna stress of it arriving late/too close to date lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Is it possible to get expedite shipping?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Not that I know of 🤷🏻‍♀️
Erik (slendergiant): Which is funny because any time I hear someone say Goro (talking about P5) I think the opposite xD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): PFFFT
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): <@386874959009415170> Just throw it on one of my containers. Easy.
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): But for real, you can have it in three days of you ship by DHL, and the pricing isn't much higher than China Post.
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): </import hacks>
