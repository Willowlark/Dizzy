Evie (Katheryne Knight): O o f
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): That means for somebody with 1000 followers only 40 people on average react to content
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That honestly seems about right
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Suddenly only getting 150ish likes doesnt seem so bad
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Same
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have my set as a personal so I know that effects things too 

But still
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Doesnt personal get better views than business?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I usually here business makes it harder
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep! Thatâ€™s what I mean like I feel that thereâ€™s more interaction with me because of mine being personal 

But wig business accounts they expect you to boost your posts and pay money

Like Facebook and pages
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I set mine to business cause i like the insights and stuff
Erik (slendergiant): I set mine to business but like, it wasn't complete because I don't have a Facebook page to link it to? But I could still see the insights and they were awful so I switched back to personal. I use a 3rd party app to keep track of how well my account is doing
Erik (slendergiant): Also, this is probably the best compliment I've ever received ðŸ˜‚
Mark (Mad Doctor): I eagerly await your 17 part series on improper use of turn signals
Erik (slendergiant): *Bakugou going for his driver's license*
Marisa (Weeb): bakugo's got better grades than deku i wanna see him on a tv quiz show
