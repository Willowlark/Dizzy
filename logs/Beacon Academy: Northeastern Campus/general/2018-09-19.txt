Erik (slendergiant): And by that I don't mean the XXX kind of adult cakes. That would be weird to eat with my family
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I like how you had to make that clarification even though you clearly stated that theirs alcohol in the cake 😂😂
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah well "adult cake" typically implies something else...
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Your sister bought you a spongebob penis cake?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Is there tiny dicks involved? @<@169297844874903552> likes to throw those in any time she can
Erik (slendergiant): I mean his nose is a little phallic...
Erik (slendergiant): 
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): So your saying you want to sit on spongebobs face Erik
Erik (slendergiant): I DIDN'T SAY THAT
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YOU BROUGHT IT UP
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): (Maybe in more ways then one?)
Erik (slendergiant): YOU SAID PENIS FIRST
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): PENIS
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Pen is cake?
Erik (slendergiant): Just let me enjoy my Spongebooze cake 😭
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): that make no sense
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): cake is the other side of the body
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Is all about the Spongebooty
Erik (slendergiant): HA
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Cake=booty not penis
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Unless your Erik then you COMBINE THEM
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): *kamina voice* WERE GUNNA COMBINE
Erik (slendergiant): 
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Beautiful
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Shit
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): i forgot the Dickbutt
Erik (slendergiant): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao <@!334090409389195266> calling me out for my tiny dick candies 😂
Marisa (Weeb): There’s a game I’d play when we had no internet which was to find the weirdest thing in the phone book. Eroticakes III is the lifelong winner so far.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Do they uh... sell sexy cake?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Otherwise that’s a VERY misleading store name
Jess (whoozica): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Or maybe it’s like one of those trust exercises
Georgia (Something Sensible): Erotically bake cake with your lover
Georgia (Something Sensible): These pros show you how to do it
Marisa (Weeb): I... I don’t know.... I could look up the number again
Why is it the third store
Maybe the owners name is just erotikarl or something
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Stir the batter... with (see nsfw channel)
Erik (slendergiant): erotic bakeries are a thing
Erik (slendergiant): this episode of the Simpsons comes to mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKBpxxyOuIk
Georgia (Something Sensible): You said Simpson’s and my first thought was the steamed hams meme
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Anybody watch Izetta The Last Witch
Rebecca (madameterralupus): No but is that what you are posting on your instastory cause it looks very interesting 😯
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ye
Marisa (Weeb): O I’ve seen about half of that. Nazi fighting gun flying yuris right?
Marisa (Weeb): That was a bit popular when it came out but immediately got overshadowed by Yuri on ice
Marisa (Weeb): it was the season of yuris
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Um 
Yes
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): They are still only friends tho
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~I cant wait till they go gay~~
Marisa (Weeb): ~~just friends is what they all say~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Im only 3 episodes in
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Dont spoil ilanything
Marisa (Weeb): is ok i'm not i literally can't remember anything past the first episode or two
Marisa (Weeb): i didn't see all of it
Marisa (Weeb): 🇪 🇳 🇯 🇴 🇾
Georgia (Something Sensible): I checked the weather this morning and went “oh 80 miles per hour, that’s a really good temperature”
Erik (slendergiant): Oh, so speaking of anime, I just made the switch from Crunchyroll to VRV and I don't know why I didn't do it sooner
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Better than Crunchyroll??
I need to switch from CR cause mine's been shitty lately with loading. I have to keep pausing it when watching for it to load or whateber and it's highkey annoying 😫
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~If I was still watching anime I'd probably still torrent it~~
Erik (slendergiant): VRV was basically started by Crunchyroll so it contains everything Crunchyroll does plus Funimation, Rooster Teeth, and loads more. Only $9.99/mo and you get all of it. So like, gonna go back and watch Darlifra and BNHA dubbed through the Funimation channel 👌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh nice. That's not too bad of a price for what all you get.👌  I'll have to check it out cause man I'm getting really damn tired of the laggy-ness of Crunchyroll recently (thus is why I'm behind on BNHA) 😓
Erik (slendergiant): *~~also has NickSplat so I can relive my childhood~~*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): VRV IS AMAZING AND MY GO TO PLACE TO WATCH ANIME
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Also <@!386874959009415170> I have mixed feelings about eh darling dub because while the voice actor for hiro was really good and made me like his character a lot more, I was NOT a fan of the girl who voices zero two. She just doesn’t have be same affection in her voice when talking to hiro as the sub did
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It was the first time I ever disliked a dub
Erik (slendergiant): I've heard it before and yeah, wasn't thrilled with her. Something about the American accent saying "darling" is very cringy
Erik (slendergiant): It's more so so I can pay attention to the animation and/or do something else while watching
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): she doesn’t say it with that musical sing songy way the sub did
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ep 21 where you get all the history and backstory was ALOT easier to follow in the dub
Erik (slendergiant): Japanese: *DAH-ling*
American: ***DAR**-ling*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): But during ep 15 when they over lay the opening song and they don’t translate the Japanese charters talking about the Jian love story
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That’s it!!! It’s dahhhh-ling idk that little difference made a big impact
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I watched the sub 4 times and the dub once I don’t have an obsession idk what your talking about
Erik (slendergiant): *are you sure?*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): NO ONE ASKED YOU ERIK
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): DONT CALL ME OUT ON MY BULLSHIT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I looked up problem in the dictionary.

It read: Problem (präbləm): Watching Darling in the Franxx more than 3 times.*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): LOOK
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I JUST REALLY LOVE ZERO TWO OK
Erik (slendergiant): *See photo*

> *picture of Meghan crying over Zero Two*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YALL WATCHED RWBY???? BECAUSE I KNOW ITS MORE THEN 4
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): called out
Erik (slendergiant): Vol 1-2 thrice, Vol 3-5 once, with the exception of certain episodes for visual references for cosplay
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've seen everything pre 5 at least twice...
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ok now I feel worse about myself. Because I know I’ve watched vol 1-3 at least 20 times
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~RWBY has been out for half a decade, Darling isn't even a year old~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I ONLY WATCHED RWBY TWO YEARS AGO THI
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): when it was on Netflix lissy and I used to have playing CONSTANTLY
Erik (slendergiant): I was working through rewatching RWBY but then I got distracted by watching other anime
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've only watched RWBY through once minus certain episodes.... now FMA... that's a whole different story 😂😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~real question is how many times have i tortured myself by rewatching the end of volume 3~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I like it better when it’s in “movie” form then when it’s epiosde by epiosde
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): To your credit, I dunno how much watching in the background while doing other stuff counts.
Erik (slendergiant): I haven't watched it that way, but I imagine it's way more convenient
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Movie form is *so nice*.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): There was a solid 2 months (from the time I first watched it to until vol 4 came out) where I didn’t watch anything else. I would finish vol 3 and just start 1 back up again
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I have a *mild* obsessive personality
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): MOOD
Marisa (Weeb): ダーリン owo
Erik (slendergiant): Got this comment on my post (assuming it would be about promoting their shit) so I went to their site to see their stuff. Ah yes, lewd anime apparel, just what I've always wanted to promote
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ya I got the SAME ONE this morning 😂😂
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I just deleted the comment and ignored it
Marisa (Weeb): that's the dream right there. one day in your NYC penthouse while sipping expensive coffee processed through monkey's orifice and wearing a plush robe you'll remember, "elitesocietyla is where this all started."
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ahego plush rope.
Marisa (Weeb): ~~you're missing an a~~
Erik (slendergiant): With all the anime girl tiddy and booty shirts I never wore in public framed on my walls
Marisa (Weeb): biru remember japanese class, u can remember the spelling of that cursed word because the second kanji is face/kao but the k turns into a g. the more u know ⭐
Marisa (Weeb): stylishly furnished sasuke apartment
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~why do you know how it's spelled then~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 😏
Marisa (Weeb): mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmemes
Marisa (Weeb): finn uses it a lot too it comes up on my news feed often <:rip:378273525804433408>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *suuuuure*
Marisa (Weeb): i came out to have a good time tonight and i'm honestly feeling so attacked right now
Marisa (Weeb): lashinbang's akihabara store for some reason thinks the best place for its hentai merchandise to be is right next to the escalators on the second floor, and the best place for cosplay is all the way on the opposite end of the building past all the hentai.
Erik (slendergiant): Finished up the important project my boss needed me to get done and now I only have really easy dumb work on my to-do list and my bosses are going away tomorrow and Friday so the rest of the week is probably going to involve a lot of dicking around <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Jess (whoozica): I remember a couple people here mentioning they read ava's demon, I finally just caught up!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YASSSSSSS
Jess (whoozica): i literally dont read it for months so i can keep reading for like an extended period of time XD
Distant Thunders: What's Ava's demon?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats fair, its better when you can just read it all in bulk
Jess (whoozica): a web comic! http://avasdemon.com/
Jess (whoozica): <@!334090409389195266>  plz cosplay

Erik (slendergiant): the art is gorgeous
Jess (whoozica): 🎉🎉
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Omg
Tom (tomukuncosplay): That art 👌
Jess (whoozica): 👌👌👌
Erik (slendergiant): So I'm going through the gallery on my phone and I realized I had a huge Instagram folder. I'm pretty sure I had "save posted photos/videos" turned off but I guess Insta turned it back on at some point? So like, if you are like me and don't like Instagram duplicating the pictures you just uploaded from your gallery, double check to make sure you have those turned off 👍
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey cosplayed from Ava's Demon last Katsu. Those who recognized her were really psyched
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sick armor build 👌👌👌
Georgia (Something Sensible): Just announced, “Rutgers University app now compatible with Starbucks online ordering app”
Matt (mattmyers25): Rip your wallet
Georgia (Something Sensible): More like RU addicted to coffee DAMN
Georgia (Something Sensible): Well, not MINE
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s just lucky a certain few others don’t go here then 😂😂😂
Tom (tomukuncosplay): *Thank god*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): If my wallet wasn't already dead it would die again if UD ever did that
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): yall
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I got a job interview
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): next week
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): at starbucks

Erik (slendergiant): MAY THE FRAPPE BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): SOON I WON'T BE PAYING FOR BUCKS 
THE BUCKS WILL BE PAYING FOR ME
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): (fingers crossed)
Mark (Mad Doctor): Boy, are they going to learn to regret their employee discount
Erik (slendergiant): So everyone's heard of Wish, right? The site you can get stuff insanely cheap which means it's usually pretty shitty?
Erik (slendergiant): This is the same bag I paid $40 for in another shady Chinese site
Erik (slendergiant): *le sigh*
Distant Thunders: yeah but wish isnt much better pretty low quality stuff sometimes. its a hit or miss
Erik (slendergiant): I know, that's what I said lol
Distant Thunders: oh
Distant Thunders: read too quickly lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): IIRC, there were some conditions which made me hesitant to use Wish
Erik (slendergiant): Everything is cheaply made and clothing is usually in Asian sizing which is like, two smaller than we're used to
Distant Thunders: Oh yeah, got a sweatshirt from them once and it made me look like a used qtip
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like a used qtip... omg 😂
Distant Thunders: Oh yeah was a bad time.  It now sits hidden in the darkest depths of my closet never to see the light of day
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We got a Weiss promo poster now~
