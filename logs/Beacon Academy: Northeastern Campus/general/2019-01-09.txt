Mark (Mad Doctor): In town to see a show. Looks like she opened a place. Sadly, the food all tasted like ashes
Anna (Cadmium): 
Anna (Cadmium): Insta is working great guys
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What the actual fuck
Rebecca (madameterralupus): O_____O o-oh....
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Wow
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Looks like Insta shit itself XD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Guys look, official Kiri merch with him in flannel
Erik (Red Riot Thot): NEED
Marisa (Mawisa): O I’ve seen those in stores
They’re blind boxes so the keychain you get is random and they’re also like $8 a box <:rip:378273525804433408>
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): RIGHT? It's a cute outfit too. Hope there's more art of it.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): <@245270932602486784> Ochako has flannel in her outfit too
Georgia (Something Sensible): God is real
Georgia (Something Sensible): My flannel prayers have been answered
Marisa (Mawisa): omg that picture has the price listed as $6 is animate jacking their prices
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Hey, to those with ita bags, is it normal for the material to stink?
Marisa (Mawisa): The plastic part? With an overwhelmingly chemical smell? That’s usually normal
Marisa (Mawisa): When it’s new
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Chemical is definitely how I'd describe it xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I stuck some dryer sheets in it
Marisa (Mawisa): I’m waiting for pvc fabric to go on sale to try and make an itabag
Marisa (Mawisa): But I’m torn between multiple ideas for it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): If you want green I have a plethora of green xD ~~miscalculated how much I'd need for penny~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Greeeen!
My main contenders are all might or a Studio Ghibli one. I could do a Pokémon one. Hm. Or a Yona one that would be rad but I wouldn’t know what shape to make the window. If my trial bags are successful I’ll start selling them
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ooo def post pics in here when you start making them!!
Marisa (Mawisa): [images of a burning landscape with a sad pile of fabric in the center]
[there is a steak knife jammed in the fabric]
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): AWESOME ILL BUY THREE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): One of those maybe with a fork instead of a knife? I'll use it for my shrek ita bag
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Could I commission like, a normal sized backpack one?
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah! When I figure out how everything goes I’ll let you know, if you’re still interested by then. Likely after Katsu. 
The window can be any shape as long as it’s not too intricate because I gotta see how hard it is to get all the tiny curves and points down
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeee!! Same! Once you're all set and confident in making them I'd love to also commission one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I wouldn't need anything fancy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It was honestly hard enough finding one that didn't have a heart-shaped window, cat ears, or a big bow on it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lol
Marisa (Mawisa): The holy trinity
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Going through all my pins and keychains and I think I might have lost my RvB Extra Life League Pin at ANYC 😭
Jess (whoozica): Noooo! 😭
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just noticed it wasn't on the strap of the bag I was using
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is precisely the reason I want an ita bag because I want to display my nerdy shit and not lose it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): NEVER MIND I FOUND IT
Jess (whoozica): Yay!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 Why/how did I not pick up before that Travis Willingham voices Cameron Campbell in Camp Camp... lol.

Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I noticed one of the jello shots I took home was missing and I panicked thinking my mom took it to work or something not realizing it had alcohol in it since note on fridge is gone about them. Thankfully that didn't happen. My dad took it XD He said it was good <@!245270932602486784>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Lol thanks I wasn’t sure cause it was rum instead of vodka but hey I’m glad lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I keep forgetting to eat them, cause whenever I remember I have to go into work or take my medicine.. XD
Glad he ate one and enjoyed it though :p Soon I shall eat mine
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ooooh nice
Mark (Mad Doctor): I don't think I've ever had a jello shot. I feel I'm missing out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Me either.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You're missing out
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've never had one either. But eyy once I remember these are in the fridge then can check that off lol
Jess (whoozica): It's like a regular shot Sept it thicc
