Georgia (Something Sensible): My mom visited me at college today and I had to sprint into my room before her and hide the little dick that my suitemate gave me LOL
Tom (tomukuncosplay): hahaha noooo DONT HIDE IT ACCEPT IT
Tom (tomukuncosplay): CMON SHE WOULDNT THINK IT WAS CUTE?
Georgia (Something Sensible): She probably wouldn’t realize it’s a peen LOL
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you're one of three sisters, she knows what a peen is~~
Marisa (Weeb): omg youtube is down
Marisa (Weeb): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Fuck
Marisa (Weeb): ~~did the rwby trailer crash it~~
Marisa (Weeb): when will youtube be back
Marisa (Weeb): bne is getting a lot of channels and it's getting a bit hard to navigate. while i do love the photo channel, is it ok to put any new stuff to a vote before it's official?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^ yeah. I'm not a voting person (long story) but it should be standardized.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Which ever way we decide.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ill third this motion, democracy is fun
ZombieHunter: I’ve been dumping too many things in terms of photography in cosplans
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~BNE needs a rough rules list imo~~
ZombieHunter: And none of it has to DO with cosplans
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Riiight... people have brought up posting gallery links instead of raw images right?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Flickr has a free 1tb hosting.
ZombieHunter: I don’t have any of those
ZombieHunter: I don’t use Flickr
Georgia (Something Sensible): its less about the channel and more about "we have 30 people here so voting is probably a good standard here on out"
Marisa (Weeb): ye the photography stuff is good, it's just we've gotten 3 or 4 new channels this month (granted, inktober is temporary) and i dunno how channels are made but i didn't want the server to get flooded in the future. i'm not angry about them.
ZombieHunter: I don’t mind channels seeing as I don’t read like
ZombieHunter: 10 of them
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~i have all channel tabs open all the time oops is that just me~~
ZombieHunter: I don’t doodle so I don’t check inktober often. I cry a lot so I like the fluffy boys
ZombieHunter: >.> it helps
Georgia (Something Sensible): ye i mean everyone has personal preferences
Georgia (Something Sensible): i dont use fluffy bois but i #respecc the need for the channel
Georgia (Something Sensible): which is why i agree with mawisa
Georgia (Something Sensible): voting is good
ZombieHunter: I think it popped in my head cuz one night it was 4 am
ZombieHunter: And I was crying a ton and didn’t wanna wake people >.>
Georgia (Something Sensible): m o o d
Georgia (Something Sensible): but yeah idk i vote that voting is good for new channel creation
Georgia (Something Sensible): _i vote for voting yall_
Marisa (Weeb): ~~i read all of them because the little dot scares me oops~~
it just gets hard to navigate with a lot. if everyone wants the channel then that's cool, like we voted on the fluffy channel right? that had a lot of support! but voting in the future would keep stuff in check. I think the photography channel would've been a certainty too because it's a good idea, but voting to enact channels could stop empty/unused channels from being created
ZombieHunter: If you right click the server
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^^
ZombieHunter: There is a “read all” button
Georgia (Something Sensible): i mean either way, keep channels to a minimum is good
Marisa (Weeb): but how can i read all if i didn't read all ;3c
Georgia (Something Sensible): i dont think we as a squad talk about enough to warrant 12+ channels
ZombieHunter: Couldn’t inktober have been part of your fanart channel
ZombieHunter: ?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel nsfw is not really need anymore cause we are all over 18?? XD
ZombieHunter: You guys also don’t
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And rarely post ..nsfw
ZombieHunter: Actually post 18+ stuff?
Erik (slendergiant): We could probably combine the art channels. I think we just added the Inktober separate because there were a few of us doing it
Georgia (Something Sensible): fanart also has autoposts from our favorite fanartists
Georgia (Something Sensible): when dishwasher posts big shit it gets crowded
Georgia (Something Sensible): inktober is just for this month anyways
ZombieHunter: I don’t understand the purpose of the dream memes channel
Georgia (Something Sensible): its just memes
ZombieHunter: Oh
Marisa (Weeb): it's for our hopes and dreams. we could mix that with general but I think general was more for real talk
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hunter, you can't ask other people to make changes for your convenience when you won't make changes yourself. Additionally, we're not putting the original or new channels on trial here.
ZombieHunter: I’m not I’m legit asking about things
ZombieHunter: Like I actually didnt know why it was called dream memes
Erik (slendergiant): NSFW is there entirely for Audrey ~~who I don't even see in the member list anymore?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): she left awhile back yeah.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ill throw up a vote for ditched nsfw cause thats a legit question
Marisa (Weeb): I didn't mean for this to be any drama I wasn't posting it to call anyone out or target anyone, I was just extremely lost looking for a specific channel oops
ZombieHunter: I also only know like
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The point is creating channels has been a group decision. This should either stay the standard, or be scriapped.
ZombieHunter: 12 people total
Marisa (Weeb): i felt nsfw was for if someone was at work and someone wanted to post a nude, the person at work wouldn't be fired
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^
ZombieHunter: Maybe ten....
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Shit. Better get in all our nudes before the channel goes away
ZombieHunter: Idk who everyone else is
ZombieHunter: Leanna no
Georgia (Something Sensible): _mods away, post nudes_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HURRY
ZombieHunter: Mood
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, you can meet them at Katsu.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): BNE has from the start been a group founded on irl connections. That's why it's Northeast, everyone here can see each other at cons and make plans.
Marisa (Weeb): you know us from this channel!! we're all bffs now. ~~i've only met people who were at konkon and i have the memory of a goldfish~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~noods posted, hot and steamy~~
ZombieHunter: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ZombieHunter: Does it count if I take my cats collar off
ZombieHunter: I call that kitty nakey time as is 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THATS LEWD HUNTER
ZombieHunter: I KNOW IM SORRY

Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): MEGHAN
