Rebecca (madameterralupus): Not my choice lmao 😕 we going to my grandparents today and my dad wants to be home before dark so 😅
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And coffee... yes. Agreed!

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Me
Matt (mattmyers25): Why are you up early?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Idk, I'm a morning person
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I just wake up and start my day by like 8 on Saturdays, sometimes earlier
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t sleep in anymore. Just doesn’t work.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Leanna you absolute MADMAN
Georgia (Something Sensible): I would sleep til noon if I could
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I try not to sleep in too hate because I feel like I waste my day off
Georgia (Something Sensible): True
Erik (Red Riot Thot): When you work 40 hours a week, you appreciate your weekends a lot more
Georgia (Something Sensible): When you work half your Saturdays, they become pretty invaluable too lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): It sucks to work when everyone else is off but at least it doesn’t interfere with schoolwork
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah in high school I worked Saturday mornings 8-12 so I never even got to sleep in until college lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Buttt you're in college, so you get to spend all week basically 5 minutes your friend group.
Marisa (Weeb): haha you said butt
Georgia (Something Sensible): No you guys don’t live 5 mins from me 💕💕💕💕
Georgia (Something Sensible): I see your point tho
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ok but
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ALL MIGHT AS SANTA
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): DEKU AS HOS RIGHR HAND ELF
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): that is all
Halim (Greg): Ok so theres a Hamilton meme
Halim (Greg): It's a comic of right hand man
Halim (Greg): Where GW is saying his lines and Hamilton keeps repeating him
Halim (Greg): Then GW is like 'stop copying me' 
And Hamilyon is like ok ok I get it
Halim (Greg): So GW says his next line and Hamilton goes 'Chika plow" or whatever
Halim (Greg): Now imagine the seen as All Might and Deku
Georgia (Something Sensible): A customer is standing right next to my desk complaining to a salesperson that she “can’t get her 16 year old son to wear underwear”
Jess (whoozica): WHAY
Tom (tomukuncosplay): WHAT
Halim (Greg): Well that boi clearly has a tiny peen
Georgia (Something Sensible): Is that the explanation
Georgia (Something Sensible): Does tiny peen mean an aversion to underwear?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I'm guesing he meanings because, like big bobbies, it would hurt to run without support
Georgia (Something Sensible): ✨ the more you know ✨
Halim (Greg): Also the inside of most mens pants dont feel nice rubbing against a peen 
A problem that increases with size
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ☝🏻
Georgia (Something Sensible): So men undies do, to some extent, lift the peen
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like a crotch bra
Halim (Greg): Especially if there are zippers
Halim (Greg): Depends 
Boxers dont
Halim (Greg): But boxer briefs or briefs yes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Since undies have a little pocket for bulge support
Halim (Greg): ^^
Georgia (Something Sensible): Huh yeah I didn’t think that that could offer support but it makes sense now that you mention it
Georgia (Something Sensible): Thank for educating me in the ways of men’s underwear
Georgia (Something Sensible): 🙏
Tom (tomukuncosplay): lmao 🙏
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I'm at Barnes and Noble and one of the employees recognized me from when I went dressed up to the release of Cursed Child... like 2 years ago 😂

Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s what my phone autocorrects
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): When someone messages me asking why I wear flannel so much and I’m like ????? Psssst you have the wrong Pyrrha 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): the answers the same tho, flannels are GR9
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Flannels are great no matter the pattern
Georgia (Something Sensible): I didn’t think we looked THAT similar but 🤷‍♀️ guess the general public can’t tell
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I was like???? I own a singular flannel what are you talking about??? And then I remembered the #flannelfam 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I own 6 they probably meant me
Georgia (Something Sensible): Unless they meant the Franken flannel that I see Erik already bought
Georgia (Something Sensible): In which case that message is a little more valid
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 6 is not that many.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Okay I wear other things 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): But 6 compared to 1 is a lot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *FRANKENFLANNEL*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 100% what I am calling that flannel now for any of you who get/wear it XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Headcannon: ruby used to steal qrows capes  when he would come to visit, so he took an old one and made her her first hood
Erik (Red Riot Thot): http://evebun.tumblr.com/post/159766545421/headcanon-baby-ruby-decided-the-best-way-to-get
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or this ☝🏻
