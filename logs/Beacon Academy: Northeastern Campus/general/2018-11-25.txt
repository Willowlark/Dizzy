Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Who.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): AH.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Kurtis is private, so it doesn't show up until he approves.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We could maybe use it to post/reshare group shots? Make it like a mass reshaping page to collectively have our groups work in? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah!
Georgia (Something Sensible): The repost app would be good for that
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’ve had people comment saying that they love what the cosplay group does
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I think it’s worth it
