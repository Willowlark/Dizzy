Rebecca (madameterralupus): We had a nice sale going on paints... so I stocked the hell up ðŸ˜‚
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ngl i love how folk art puts the color on the top
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: 10/10 good move
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yesss agreed! Cause my holder showed the top of them so can nicely see what color they are with that sticker
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: bruh i measured the fabric i picked up at goodwill on a whim?
I got 12 yards of white flannel for $4
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: thats like 33 cents a yard
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh nice!
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: i dont know what to do with this now.
Im gonna use it to mock up my AC coat because i can actually see my markings then. 
but like. *twelve yards*
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I feel i should do something with some of it. Whelp. Ill get to that eventually
