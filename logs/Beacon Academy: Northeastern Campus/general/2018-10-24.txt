Georgia (Something Sensible): so like, why do calendars often have when theres a full moon
Georgia (Something Sensible): is it just in case a werewolf wants to buy a calendar
Georgia (Something Sensible): like, is there any utility to knowing theres a full moon?
Marisa (Weeb): Ocean people who sail a lot and rural people maybe? Or people excessively watching their weight? People who are really passionate about the moon?
Marisa (Weeb): To be aware when people are moon crazy
Marisa (Weeb): To know when the full and new moons are for peak sacrifice times
Jess (whoozica): Cuz dey pretty
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): When the full moon is in the sky, the fae are pulled to our realm, and we best be cautious of those we run into at night
When the moon is gone and a new moon is nigh, we are drawn to the fae, and best be careful not to lose our way
