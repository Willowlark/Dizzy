Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Doubtful but let's hold onto that sliver of hope
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There’s no way they’d do that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah I’m on pixiv oops.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Motivational and inspirational commercials should be banned from the super bowl. Funny commercials are better.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Get rid of the sad ones too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye. Budweiser is the only except because the *dogs and the Clydesdales are a lagend*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But they stopped making those commercials cause they weren’t “hip”.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, where are the Dorito commercials? They usually have good ones
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh tru.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Slong as we don’t get another “puppy monkey baby”
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh God

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): HA a Scientology commercial.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh god
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This game is pathetic and it literally can’t end in a tie.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is it currently at a tie?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pray ANYONE manages to score again.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s been 3-3 for most of the game.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Harrison ford!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The game is still going on?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I want to see the drop in viewership after the halftime show
Marisa (Mawisa): neckbeard magical girl has become two judgey magical girlfriends
Marisa (Mawisa): what flavor doritos is the dorito girl
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Do they make monster flavor doritos or did my mind just make that up
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I wouldnt be surprised if they did~~
Marisa (Mawisa): google sadly shows no results
Marisa (Mawisa): how about another flavor
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Blue
Marisa (Mawisa): nice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): For anyone not into football: the giants had a 2-8 record at one point this season and they had more interesting games. This game sucked.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Welp... hearing Patriots won?
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): still sad but now with dew-chan and dori-chan

Mark (Mad Doctor): Here's your obsessive long range Katsu forecast: Looks like rain all weekend, but with reasonable temperatures. What space they gain from kicking out lobbyconners might be lost to losing outdoor venues. Meanwhile, the rain is going to fall as snow up north. 2-4 inches Thursday night into Friday morning, which could screw with my travel plans.  Hoping the Outlook changes for the better
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Good thing Chris and I are leaving Thursday during the day 

He also has a Jeep so we don't have to worry as much
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Fack we leaving Thursday night. 
Hopefully the Jeep luck will shine on me too

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I saw a girl trying to get out of the crowded elevator in the office and a woman was just fucking blocking the door and not paying attention behind her. I grabbed the door and had to say “excuse me” because girl would only hop up and down rather than speak up.
Marisa (Mawisa): A true American hero
Marisa (Mawisa): Thank u for your service
Rebecca (madameterralupus): There are still good people in this world 👏🏻
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m certainly not one of them.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OH then I got to sit and wait for three women to finish their conversation, half in the elevator, one of them with her fucking leg keeping the door from closing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Rudest thing I’ve ever seen.

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof
Marisa (Mawisa): But it’s fun
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it takes commitment lol
Jess (whoozica): LMAO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): LOL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm guessing that's from a Jumin route
Marisa (Mawisa): i think im gonna do baehee's route again
Jess (whoozica): i think its shopped
Marisa (Mawisa): it's one of those name changes
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Jess (whoozica): omg marisa u gon kill me
Marisa (Mawisa): mystic meme time
Marisa (Mawisa): we need people to play with us
Jess (whoozica): i love the blog on tumblr that just takes texts from last night and puts them in MM format
Marisa (Mawisa): that's so good
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i would play but i cant at work so that most of the day
Marisa (Mawisa): it's basically text messages
Anna (loud and likely blonde): also. 
i found a stupid twitter for the bnha kids and its just. like them shitposting
Anna (loud and likely blonde): todoroki catching a seagull for izuku
Marisa (Mawisa): 95% of mystic mess is done through a chatroom that looks like a text conversation. great for pretending you have friends.
Marisa (Mawisa): and then the playable parts are options like this
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok but like i would miss them if its timed
Marisa (Mawisa): <:rip:378273525804433408>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): as long as you do them before the next ones come
Marisa (Mawisa): pay real money to not miss them <:lenny:456549338026344489>
depending on the chat you have an hour to three hours before the next one so you can do it anytime within that time frame
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but still, difficult to do at work if you can't be on your phone for like, a couple minutes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): make sure to set an alarm for 3am
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 3AM?
Marisa (Mawisa): if you miss one it's not the end of the world but you should aim for ~70% of all chats to get a good ending, and most are in the evening because they know people have work
Marisa (Mawisa): yeah seven and yoosung like to stay up late
Marisa (Mawisa): and sometimes jaehee and jumin work late
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): there's usually a chat somewhere between 2:30-3:30am
Marisa (Mawisa): but we love them
Jess (whoozica): honestly i ussually just day the 5 hourglasses to reopen it
Jess (whoozica): which isnt realy money cuz u earn them while playing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I finally had enough hourglasses to unlock the deep route
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): torn between jaehee or ray routes
Jess (whoozica): get another phone, do both
Marisa (Mawisa): i wanna hear ray sing again but i can do the christmas route for that too
Marisa (Mawisa): ok
Erik (Red Riot Thot): heads up there's a lunar new year update which has a text conversation before loading (which you can skip) but it sometimes crashes the game
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but it has Ray and Rika
Marisa (Mawisa): yesssssssssss
Marisa (Mawisa): what were the chats where they were on jumin's island messing with each other on the beach. were those the summer chats
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Marisa (Mawisa): those were gold
Marisa (Mawisa): these are still gold i forgot vandy was there too
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is Erik doing Jumin route?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~When~~ If I start again I'll be going *D E E P* so I have to choose whether to do 707 because he's obviously best boy or Jumin for getting into character
Marisa (Mawisa): *if*
Marisa (Mawisa): when
Marisa (Mawisa): there is no escape from the mystic mess
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): if you're aiming to do this pre con MM rush, Jumin makes sense.
Jess (whoozica): this weather is clearing my skin ans watering my crops
Jamie (Jamie): I can never keep up with MM despite my loving it but the real time thing makes me lose track so fast ~~hard enough keeping up in these chats lmao~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ok now all my roommates for next year  are meeting at the dining hall
Georgia (Something Sensible): LETS SEE HOW DIS GOES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Tell them how much of a svage your bf is LOL
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Be like you mess w/ me hill go savage on ya
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "If any of you suck, my bf won the hunger games and hes not afraid to strangle you with a rope"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 'I have multiple friends with cars and sharp objects who are willing to bleed for their passions dont tempt me'
