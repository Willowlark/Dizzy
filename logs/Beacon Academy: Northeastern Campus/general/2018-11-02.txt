Rebecca (madameterralupus): https://www.delish.com/food-news/a24517081/starbucks-free-reusable-cups/?fbclid=IwAR2wfXRbnuVxQ1HBTFXNOGBC-40pwzT6q6SlQYSjisxTZTpuI-YwTuQW1kE

Marisa (Weeb): omg is that a thing where you use the app to get cups because my sister and her wife did that at dunkin donuts but they exploited some time-based loophole where it took a while for the transaction to process and the app code to become invalid so they got like 16 dunkin donuts cups
Marisa (Weeb): by driving around to every dunkin donuts
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think its store based. But maybe you can do it through the app to? I'm not sure to be honest lol. But daaamnnn that's a lot of Dunkin Donuts cups XDD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I saw this too. Will probably do it. My problem is I rarely ever order in store lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But if it's after 2pm I can get it after work when I'm not in a rush
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's anytime, as long as it's a holiday drink. 👌 
And mhmm since I finally figured out the app a while back I don't order in store much either.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): FUUUU.Welp Ill get it before work tomorrow. I'll just be very hyper active and bug framing Eric all evening 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wait,I think thats just for after you get the drink/cup. Article I read said you can get the first drink/cup anytime?
snow ( karma chameleon ): im not even in starbucks fam this is cruelty
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah, that's what I meant
snow ( karma chameleon ): concept: team strq is baristas. strqbucks. thats my new cosplay
Marisa (Weeb): that screenshot says you already need a cup and you'll just get a discount
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's my new art idea
snow ( karma chameleon ): credit me pls
snow ( karma chameleon ): i worked hard on this tomfoolery
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Of course!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh okay XD
And lmfao yes. Let's do iiiitttttt
snow ( karma chameleon ): I WILL STEAL STARBUCKS APRONS BACK FOR THIS AU
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Taiyang is the cool barista dude. Raven can be the bitchy manager XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): wait.... can you actually do that cause im cracking up at STRQbucks now
Marisa (Weeb): oh man the old otakon location had a perfect spot for starbucks cosplays I did a photoshoot there for some really good haikyuu baristas
where we gonna find a shoot spot
snow ( karma chameleon ): GEORGia i am 200% serious
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The new spot for Otakon literally has a Starbucks you could shoot at
Georgia (Something Sensible): idk if im just laughing at like, every funny thing right now, but STRQbucks is hilarious
snow ( karma chameleon ): summer rose, ur friendly neighborhood barista
Marisa (Weeb): orly
but can you get behind the counter and hog the pitchers and whatnot
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg Marisa
snow ( karma chameleon ): i need a shot of raven throwing coffee in someones face
Marisa (Weeb): we gotta be polite we can't be hogging the creamers
Georgia (Something Sensible): "hi can i get soy milk, im lactose intolerant" raven looks the customer dead in the eye and pours whole milk
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You know I'd do it.Just gimme the right person XD
snow ( karma chameleon ): hi welcome to strqbucks, ozpin made us do this for extra credit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ***I DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF I SPELLED YOUR NAME WRONG TAKE YOUR GODDAMN COFFEE AND GET THE FUCK OUT*** ~Raven (probably)
snow ( karma chameleon ): raven spells names wrong on purpose wym
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am living for this
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh tru
Georgia (Something Sensible): "cup for jaune" cup says: juan
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I really wish I still had my Chef Haru stuff now...damn
snow ( karma chameleon ): i dont need starbucks fam i have strqbucks fam
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> Yeet
snow ( karma chameleon ): qrow is my coworker who'd bring booze to work and sneak it into his own coffee
snow ( karma chameleon ): i could've done a shoot at my old starbucks but they shut down ; - ;
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): We could probably do a shoot at the starbucks i work at maybe?
snow ( karma chameleon ): is it newark? i'd be down af
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ik weve gotten some shots in the mall starbucks, they may let us if its during a down time
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Glasgow
snow ( karma chameleon ): VALID
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I scrolled back up cause I was curious who voted for what in the No Shave November poll earlier... I like how he said guys vote and only 1 did. The rest was the girls XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I expect to see some nice grown beards by the end of the month ladies~ :p
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I mean i didsnt say guys as in the gender 
But thats a funny coincidence xD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Alas the people voted against no shaving for the month
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh I took it as that XD my bad. But still lol. I expect Jess and Georgia to have some nice beards by the end of the month 😝
Georgia (Something Sensible): the people are BULL if i could grow facial hair i would take he opportunity to rock it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I think it would definitely make a net statement if you could
Georgia (Something Sensible): jess and i will pressure a man into beard growing in our place
Georgia (Something Sensible): like when rich people paid people to take their place in the draft
Georgia (Something Sensible): i also almost typed bread and that wouldve been confusing
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I wonder 
my ex boss wanted me to grow a beard when i told him i was quitting 
He was like "i want to see you with a beard sometime when you visit"
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I wonder if hed give me free food
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I grew this beard for your sir, now gimme free food XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): 1 beard = 1 free bagel
Georgia (Something Sensible): its a unit of measurement
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Puhlease
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): If i grow a beard i demand a lunch sandwich
Georgia (Something Sensible): like the beard exchange rates are really low right now okay
Georgia (Something Sensible): you have to wait until after november
Georgia (Something Sensible): when the beard market is experiencing a larger shortage
Georgia (Something Sensible): then your chin whiskers get more valuable
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Oof but konkon is early december
Georgia (Something Sensible): you gotta do it til the like DAY before konkon then
Georgia (Something Sensible): how committed are you to this lunch sandwich
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats the real question
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ngl considering I'm pretty sure my ex boss is/has hit on me while i was working there and while i wasnt
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I am very not committed to said lunch sandwich
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah that would be a nefarious exchange
Georgia (Something Sensible): youd be going in there with beard and hoping to get lunch meat
Georgia (Something Sensible): and theyd be hoping to get more than just a look at your beard LMAO
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I dint go there very often and i only go after 2 cause i know he dont work after that
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): omg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh damn 😦 lol
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Does no shave november...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay so like on the topic of beards: I used to hate them on guys. It's kinda changed in the last year? Now I'm like aight okay they ain't bad. Lil stubble mhm 😏👌🏻
Georgia (Something Sensible): beards are like communism
Georgia (Something Sensible): great in theory
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Idk that burns a face when kissing
Georgia (Something Sensible): horrible in practice
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah that
Georgia (Something Sensible): no one wants to make out with sandpaper
Georgia (Something Sensible): also food crumbs?
Georgia (Something Sensible): in the beard?
Georgia (Something Sensible): not good
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Like a beard needs to be a solid bit past stubble before its good to kiss
Georgia (Something Sensible): youre not making your beard your personal to go bag
Marisa (Weeb): o but girls do no shave november too right?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷🏻‍♀️ never experienced. Only man I ever kissed couldn't grow facial hair for shit 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): but if its too long youre like "wow i love making out with merlin"
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cause after a certain length it becomes soft
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I love making out with Merlin OMG 😂
Marisa (Weeb): isn't it all hair like arm and leg hair
Georgia (Something Sensible): MMM gandalf your sexy beard
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can't 😂 nooo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hard pass on those beard lengths
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ok but making out with Merlin from Merlin??
Marisa (Weeb): i know someone who did a gandalf boudoir shoot brb
Georgia (Something Sensible): do you mean: the party wizards
Georgia (Something Sensible): now THATS a patreon id get behind
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@288513265661902858> do you need to order in store to get that cup?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): We opened at 5:30 and ran out of red cups at 6am
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Stores only got 25 free cups
Marisa (Weeb): Wow that sucks
Riot
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You can buy them again tomorrow for 2.50$ but no more free ones
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn that sucks. It looks like the one I'm at still has some? We shall see lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is like the Szechuan Sauce debacle all over again
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 100% is 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also I got one! Yea boiiiissss
Marisa (Weeb): did you shout "i'm pickle rick" when you got it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂 no. And I'll pass on that lol
Jess (whoozica): do it have a lid?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea. The white piece is the lid. They gave mine to me empty. Idk if that's how they all are doing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also lid looks funny cause it's upside down 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I probably wouldn't use it anyway because 1.) I usually only order via the app because fuck lines, and 2.) I usually order venti sized
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^same.
I'll probs just use this to cart coffee I make at home when can't stop or afford actual Starbucks 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I also wanted it cause I have a slight obsession with coffee cups 🙊
Jess (whoozica): ME TOO <@!169297844874903552>  !! <@!351785752197201920>  has to stop me buying coffee mugs and trvel mugs all the time. amd starbucks's mugs and cups are so cute all the time arggg
Jess (whoozica): our coffee mug cabinet is like bursting XD when i mived out my mom was like "we have like no mugs anymore"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Sending a message about an Eric I work with
> Typing...
> types Eri*k*.
> Realizes all the Eriks I know use a K
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I never met anyone else who spelled it the way I do until high school
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And then I met another one in college
Marisa (Weeb): fight
Marisa (Weeb): fight your doubles
Erik (Red Riot Thot): In college, I was Tall Erik and he was Jewish Erik
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but then he dropped out after a semester lol
Jess (whoozica): I always end up with Jess's that could be described the same way as me. In highschool i ahd a class with another Jess H with Brown hair and green eyes. Now i work with another Jess who is smol and blonde with dark roots
Jess (whoozica): we have a Jesse (guy) now too and we are all around the same height so all out time cards end up grouped together on the rack.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I know so many Erik/Eric's now I have to nickname them all so I don't get confused
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lmao same Jess! I know imma go home with this and my moms gonna be like really?!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The only other Eri*k* I know is my sister's boyfriend.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): For anyone who kickstarted combat ready, it's shipped apparently.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): wow I totally forgot that was a thing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): apparently so did RT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Never back a kickstarter and expect to receive it on time.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I kickstarted the megatokyo visual novel project about 6 years ago. (I know the artist, kinda.) 

I know for a fact I'll never see the finished product, cause despite his efforts it's just not happening.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): True. I just checked back when I backed OneBarCo and the estimated delivery was Aug 2015 and that's when I backed it lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Forget when it actually came in but it *was* a while
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I backed their second kickstarter and I got my order only two months later than expected
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I also backed the Trogdor board game recently, but with how many updates I get from that, it looks like they might actually be on track to have it out by June
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): All the things I have backed. I've gotten two of them.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bloodstained regularly updates. Idol Manager is basically done iirc, they just needed money for art assets to seal the deal. The Good Life tried *3* kickstarters before they got one through, they started at 1.5 million US. I have no expectation it'll ever happen, but it's a mystery photography sim. Like? and you turn into a cat.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not worried about the wallet, that'll probably come. I just backed it.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I didn't even know I had an account until I tried logging in
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): one of the benefits of using the same password for everything? 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's bad if you get pwned though~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Highly recommend a password manager.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah I know I shouuldn't
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I used to do same password everywhere too.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have a variety of passwords
Erik (Red Riot Thot): most of which are variations of the same
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~give us an example~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but for most of my "quick make an account that I'll probably forget about" it's the same
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): seriously tho, password managers are kinda great. I only remember the password to get into the thing, then the rest of my passwords are 16 character cryptographic hashes.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need a better system for managing passwords
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'm fucked if I lose the database though~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But it's on dropbox so cloud backups.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have a note saved for my more recent accounts with hints for the password that only I'd know what the full thing it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like "usual" or "Usual" when it needs a capital letter and "Usual!" when it needs a capital and special character
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or if it's a full sentence password, I have the first letter of each word
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): While I appreciate the coolness of your 'encryption' scheme, that's gotta back fire sometime
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://lifehacker.com/5529133/five-best-password-managers this article is from 2017 but it's generally a good starting point. I would *not* recommend lastpass though, in the last year they got hacked. I switched the Keepass after that (which is a little more technical than some of the other offerings (but free)).
Erik (Red Riot Thot): eventually
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm currently looking into Dash Pass
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ooh, the premium version includes a VPN
Erik (Red Riot Thot): so according to Dashlane, I have created 208 accounts since 2012 using my primary email, 91 of which are often targeted in hacks 🙃
Georgia (Something Sensible): WELP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YE Lastpass scanned my email when I started and I was like 'shit I made an account where'?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's kind of like a trip down memory lane
Erik (Red Riot Thot): wow I could spend an entire day adding accounts and changing passwords
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I decided to go for the premium. Figure having a VPN isn't a bad idea
Jess (whoozica): I had a dream my paycheck was 175 more this week, alas it was only a dream
Georgia (Something Sensible): I had a dream that this monk kept yelling at me “you’re on top of a mountain, aren’t you!?”
Georgia (Something Sensible): I woke up very confused
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Was it because you were on top of a mountain?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nope I was on a street in the city
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Even when you woke up.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Then I was in my dorm lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ... on top of a mountain.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bill are you that monk
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I had a dream....
that one day this nation will rise 
up, live out the true meaning of its creed: "we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
Georgia (Something Sensible): MLK when did you get here
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Might as well be <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Mark (Mad Doctor): "And when I meet Thomas Jefferson..."
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): "IMMA COMPEL HIM TO INCLUDE WOMEN IN THE SEQUAL"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Work
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://lifehacker.com/look-up-your-name-on-urban-dictionary-1830179560
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So, uh, yeah. That's actually a good pick me up.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Billy is filled with all sorts of good shit.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *That pass was freaking Erik*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *Because he can Erik better than anyone* 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is the newer top definition since I last looked at at... a little too mushy
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Urban dictionary is my new number one fan*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Also he has a girthquake*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~not wrong~~

~~also didn't have to follow that link to figure out what it was~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Billy, you stud
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 1, totally true.

2, <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 an ass the size of Jupiter... ummm
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Damn urban dictionary being nice today
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean hell, I'll take it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's some sweet stuff.
Jess (whoozica): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *As the only wife in this server, the example couldn't be accurate*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): In high school I took a film and media class and our first project was to make a video about the meaning of our name and at the end of line I put the UD definition 😂
Jess (whoozica): which one you rigged these results
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I couldn't come up with this stuff.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm a ball of sarcasm and sadness.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ a mood
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Omg
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Unless you listen to my definition where I'm "A wise, yet rather young, playful soul. A thinker, a bit of a philosopher, a lover, and quite a debater."
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Holy shit
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I fucking died
Jess (whoozica): LMFAO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OPFFT
Jess (whoozica): THATS YOU approahes with caution till offered food
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This just in ya'll... Tom is actually a Canadian Goose 😱 we've found out his secret
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 
Jess (whoozica): I was just about to post that
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I like the goose <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Das a good Tom.
Jess (whoozica): the second one under thomas is good too lol
Jess (whoozica): WTF the third one is: Thomas 
A noun that is the act of not studying anything ever and passing everything.
Jess (whoozica): accurate
Tom (tomukuncosplay): HAHAHAHAHA
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Just read that as well
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh *ERIK*.
Jess (whoozica): OMG ERIK XD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): "Hal: A Lady Killer... He Literally kills ladies."
Jess (whoozica): lmao hes like literally a murderer
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg Erik  😂
And o-oh... well alright then Hal 😱
Jess (whoozica): "what perfect mean, its all about halim" plx makt that your catch phrase
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is probably the most accurate one for me
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): There is literally only 1 definition of Halim
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Thats the reason I looked up Hal as well
Erik (Red Riot Thot): > *shy at first*
> *caring*
> *loves to cuddle*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did you just say the most accurate definition is the one that equates your name to *perfection*?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gunna start doing that at shoots.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Well, my name *is* Erik, soooo... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > "Okay, adjust your sword down a bit..."
> "Alright, now half step closer..."
> "Erik, hold that pose"
> "Okay, now Erik move closer..."
> "Alright, Yang to the left, and... Erik."
> "..."
> "Erik, don't move to the left too, Yang was in the most Erik spot."
> "NO you don't go in her spot, her spot is Erik for her, you go back to where you were!"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 😂
Jess (whoozica): im likeing this one for just Jess: someone who might mainly obsess on weight or relationships but will eat a whole pizza and go on tumblr anyway.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): BLESS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WHAT A GIRL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): A mood
Jess (whoozica): almost all the Jess/Jessica ones say "omg all the boys love her" 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Much like Leo tropes, I feel like the traits assigned to Billy are too accurate for it to be coincidence.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel this fits me best cause:
- insecure
- weird
- faithful 
- good advice and keeping secrets 
🤷🏻‍♀️
Jess (whoozica): great tits 👏
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I knew someone was gonna point that out 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I love how that's so subtly slid in there with the rest of the definition
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The electromagnetism jokes are less jokes these days.
Jess (whoozica): The first ones pretty accurate for me but this ones damn accurate too 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol right, just like normal stuff and then * great tits* o-oh... okay....
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Isn't that Jessica jones
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Hmmm
Jess (whoozica): fuckfuckfuckfuck
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *hawt tit :/*
Jess (whoozica): that was fun 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Deff! 🙌🏻
