Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I'll stick to my coffee. I'd rather not risk a heart attack lol~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but the heart palpitations are so nice
Anna (loud and likely blonde): srs i drink like 6 cups of coffee a day otherwise
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I 've already had enough heart issues. I'm good XD~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *yeets self into the nth dimension*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i dont even do it for energy just to avoid the soul crushing headache

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im trying to counter my mistake of taco bell yesterday
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Salad is boring to me. And like... it doesn't fill me up at all.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'll never understand how people consider it a meal and it fills them up XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea same
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i just ate an entire salad and im still starving
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so like what was the point

Anna (loud and likely blonde): croutons hurt my teeths

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I donâ€™t feel the effect from 5 hour energy.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Wish I did.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): actually i htink the only reason ive been eating healthy is sugar hurts my teeth a LOT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wait to eat croutons until they soggy XD but then they kinda gross
Anna (loud and likely blonde): then its like salad soup
Jess (whoozica): i had a really good salmon salad at katsu after not eating all day and it was beautiful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....the ...chicken in the salad was good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I only recently started eating salad but mostly because I don't like most dressings and dry salad is blegh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Same Erik. I don't like most dressings either.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I always want to try some kind of actual salad meal at restaurants but then I'm like *I'd be missing out on this bangin' looking burger...*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mostly like French... and that's it. But even then, not really lol.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So far I only like honey mustard, italian, and raspberry vinaigrette
Jess (whoozica): balsamic is good and raspberry vinaigrette
Jess (whoozica): i like alot of dressings tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yeee raspberry vin is good
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's the one I tend to use recently ~~when i force myself to eat a salad~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): balsamic was one of the first ones I tolerated but then after a while I didn't like it much anymore
Jess (whoozica): restaurant salads are good i end up eating slot cuz low carb
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I really don't like ranch but somesties idk what to get and dont want to listen to all the names so just go with it lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mooooood
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I liek ranch for dipping veggie into but nto for my salad
Erik (Red Riot Thot): some friends and I had a brunch thing back in January and we had a salad with spinach, gouda, strawberries, and raspberry vinaigrette and it was ðŸ‘Œ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Huh sounds interesting ðŸ˜®
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I also get confused when strawberries are on salads. My mom does that a lot. Seems weird to me but she says its really good??
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh, not gouda... feta I think
Erik (Red Riot Thot): some kind of cheese

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i paid 7 dollars
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Holy shit. Have ya'l ever been to a saladworks??
They give you so little on your salad and it's so damn pricey
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): vs my normal lunch that is way more filling for like 4

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): pfft. I raise you my dorm was built on a pizza hut.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yee. I hate when ya live or work near a place that you eat there so much and get burnt out on it T_T
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): to be fair, i dont like anything fancy and the seasoning is what makes moes trash to me
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): For three years.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its very bland, but i also dont do salsa or guac or anything
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Dominos was across the street.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol wtf... Millersville has nothing cool like that right on campus. We have a saxbys which is like a knock off starbucks but it's not good.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Odds are ubereats will deliver it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We had 1 near my house years ago but it closed and is now an ihop but 2 just opened again within the past 2 years
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the only thing I *really* like from Burger King is their fries
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): YES
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Loved the fries as a kid.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I like their fries best out of all the major fast food chains
Anna (loud and likely blonde): agreed
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof yea. I used to eat BK and McD's a tooonnn but recently stopped. Trying to avoid them cause eew. They are really not good for you or just.. good in general lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~McDonalds fries are garbage~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): BK has the most crispy fries
Anna (loud and likely blonde): AGREED
Anna (loud and likely blonde): TOO THIN, TASTELESS EXCUSE FOR POTATO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): thin, cold, and floppy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like only fast food place I really eat anymore is Chic Fil A...and even then not really. idk when I had them last
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i had taco bell yesterday and i wanted to die so thats just another fast food place to never go to again
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wendy's is a close second for normal fries for me
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): fresh MD fries aren't bad.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i cant eat fast food, it fucks me up. takes me prisoner
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): lol tru.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I haven't eaten at any of those places in at least a year. Longer for Wendys cause i dislike them a lot lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I always feel like I want to die after getting Taco Bell but I'll still go back
Anna (loud and likely blonde): all taco bell tastes the same
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Those cheesy potato burritos give me life
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I avoid fast fod to be healthier.. yet still eat like shit XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and wreck my bowels
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i eat the cheese and the cheese hates me~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): https://www.drinkarizona.com/product/aztec-slides
Anna (loud and likely blonde): omfg need
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Most of my meals anymore are Wawa, Sheetz or Jake's Wayback if not at home lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~ngl i eat 7-11 burgers, leftover pasta, mashed potato, lentils, beans and rice and hot dogs, and straight sauerkraut~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you still doing better than I
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That awkward moment when you go to pick up your Amazon order but the Speedway the lockers are located at is under active construction...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Isnâ€™t the last time you used an amazon locker for red riot thot.*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Honestly I just use it so my parents don't comment about how much shit I buy online lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk how u do it my housemates comment on how much stuff i order like
*u too would have money if you didnt spend it all on weed*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): put on ya hard hat and dodge some cranes i believe in you
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like literally there were construction vehicles digging up the ground... and there was a break in the fenced off area to get in...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I could have gone in but I'm sure they would have told me off
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But like, you'd think they'd have moved the lockers to a publicly accessible area during construction...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm assuming construction wasn't actively going on when they delivered it this morning
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think stores collect a usage fee from Amazon. They could care less whether you have access to it (I'm looking at you, cranky 7-11 proprietor)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I went back to see if they were done for the day and maybe I could get my package but then on the way I realized if they're done for the day the fence will probably be locked up with No Trespassing signs on it, but I drove by anyway and sure enough that was the case. The thing is, if I don't pick it up by Friday, they're going to pick it up and return it... but... if they can't get in either... how's that gonna work ðŸ˜‚
Matt (mattmyers25): What would you like to see changed in the con community? Asking for reasons
