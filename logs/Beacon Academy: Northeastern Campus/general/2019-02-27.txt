Evie (Katheryne Knight): Same <@!169297844874903552>  I might remake her for Otakon depending on my plans. 

I think I'm going to lean more towards MHA and maybe the Fate anime. Maaaaaaybe Assassination Classroom depending on if Chris likes it.
Chris Onyx: So
I had an idea
What if I 3D printed my qrow sword, and kept its transforming ability?
Chris Onyx: Actually <@229713389511901185>  had this idea
Chris Onyx: Apparently PETG plastic has a stronger tensile strength than the pine wood the sword is made out of currently
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It might be heavier though. I looked up the density of both and PETG is about 3x as dense as pine wood. But maybe depending on your infill settings it might not be?
Chris Onyx: Yeah i fill will definitely be the make or break for its weight, but with a lower infill and thicker shells it shouldnt be too bad
Chris Onyx: Infill*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Worst case, motivation to work out.
Chris Onyx: Not gonna lie ive already used this sword to work out lmao
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Yeah, I can benchpress on Harbringer*
Chris Onyx: 6ibs but the weight is focused towards the blade, holding it with my arms out *hurts* lmao
Erik (Red Riot Thot): would you just do the blade 3D printed?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like a 3D printed handle would still break easier than wood
Chris Onyx: I'd probably keep the PVC handle and the wooden dowel rod for the base mechanics
Chris Onyx: But I think petg would be strong enough for a handle if dense enough, but
Chris Onyx: 
Chris Onyx: Also, she's fixed and freshly oiled so she dont squeak no more
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You're looking at a hell of a print time though lol
Chris Onyx: Oh my god geah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If you do decide to do it, I could help model some stuff if you'd like
Chris Onyx: Easily weeks
Chris Onyx: My current biggest issue is trying to copy the dimensions of the one I have, without tearing it apart
Georgia (Something Sensible): college is weird
Georgia (Something Sensible): i got a 47 on a midterm but thats a B+ because the class is so hard
Georgia (Something Sensible): so i spent like 5 mins angsting before realizing that thats above average
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's STEM, been telling you that for a year.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _fuk stem_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~run screaming from the class when a  C is a 26 tho~~
Matt (mattmyers25): Talk about a curve
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Reasons I didn't do chem or bio in college: see above
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Random but does. Anyone else get way too excited when they see their packages are out for delivery
Marisa (Mawisa): Iâ€™m sitting next to the door ready to pounce
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have boots and a Blake figure waiting for me ðŸ˜­
Marisa (Mawisa): Do your delivery drivers knock because ours never knock ever they just leave the box
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm usually never home when it's delivered but if I am usually they just leave it
Marisa (Mawisa): That sucks at least toot a horn or something to let us know youâ€™re here so we donâ€™t have to stalk
Jess (whoozica): sometime the package in in the mail box, sometimes its by the garage, sometimes its on the stairs, one time it was like in the grass next to the garage, they never knock
Marisa (Mawisa): Itâ€™s like a game!!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I had a weird experience on Sunday where I was expecting a package and then I got a notification that said an attempt was made but they couldn't deliver it. There was no delivery attempt note on our door (which was open btw so they literally could have opened the storm door and yeeted it into my house)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And then a few hours later I got a delivery confirmation and it was out in the mailbox
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But it wasn't there before
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Africa by Toto started to play in my class... he paused it and the whole class just erupted in anger ðŸ˜‚
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What a headline
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i bet they did the clappy tong thing first
Jess (whoozica): LOL CRABBY ðŸ˜‚
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Mark (Mad Doctor): "I got this injury fighting the tonight."
"The Chinese mafia?"

Anna (loud and likely blonde): *one hour till i can go home i have PACKAGES*
Jamie (Jamie): guys trying to decide on something for doing custom commissions and I know i can do drawings and such but thinking do you think people would be willing to pay 50+ for custom plushies if i opened spots for those as well?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think so! I've seen some of the plushies you've made before and they are V nice~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Speaking of packages...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My shiny Blake came in
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GLITTER BAE
Erik (Red Riot Thot): To go with my shiny ~~V1~~ Yang
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me, late to class: taking my time cause itâ€™s a lab lecture so I know the info already
Georgia (Something Sensible): Freshman from class: SPRINTS past me, also late
Georgia (Something Sensible): If that doesnâ€™t show the difference between years, idk what does
