Evie (Katheryne Knight): Same <@!169297844874903552>  I might remake her for Otakon depending on my plans. 

I think I'm going to lean more towards MHA and maybe the Fate anime. Maaaaaaybe Assassination Classroom depending on if Chris likes it.
Chris Onyx: So
I had an idea
What if I 3D printed my qrow sword, and kept its transforming ability?
Chris Onyx: Actually <@229713389511901185>  had this idea
Chris Onyx: Apparently PETG plastic has a stronger tensile strength than the pine wood the sword is made out of currently
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It might be heavier though. I looked up the density of both and PETG is about 3x as dense as pine wood. But maybe depending on your infill settings it might not be?
Chris Onyx: Yeah i fill will definitely be the make or break for its weight, but with a lower infill and thicker shells it shouldnt be too bad
Chris Onyx: Infill*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Worst case, motivation to work out.
Chris Onyx: Not gonna lie ive already used this sword to work out lmao
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Yeah, I can benchpress on Harbringer*
Chris Onyx: 6ibs but the weight is focused towards the blade, holding it with my arms out *hurts* lmao
Erik (Red Riot Thot): would you just do the blade 3D printed?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like a 3D printed handle would still break easier than wood
Chris Onyx: I'd probably keep the PVC handle and the wooden dowel rod for the base mechanics
Chris Onyx: But I think petg would be strong enough for a handle if dense enough, but
Chris Onyx: 
Chris Onyx: Also, she's fixed and freshly oiled so she dont squeak no more
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You're looking at a hell of a print time though lol
Chris Onyx: Oh my god geah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If you do decide to do it, I could help model some stuff if you'd like
Chris Onyx: Easily weeks
Chris Onyx: My current biggest issue is trying to copy the dimensions of the one I have, without tearing it apart
