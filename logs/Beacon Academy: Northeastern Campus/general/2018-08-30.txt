Erik (slendergiant): So I took the assessment thing this company had me take... Not sure how I feel about it
Matt (mattmyers25): Whys that?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Those assessments are crap shoots.
Erik (slendergiant): There were personality portions that basically gave four scenario type things and you choose which one is most relatable to you and least relatable. And there were dozens of those and I feel like a lot of my honest answers basically told that I don't like leading or straying away from protocol or taking risks and that I'm easily stressed and whatnot...
Erik (slendergiant): So not sure how desirable that made me look
Erik (slendergiant): And the "math" portion he mentioned was just pattern recognition but BOY were they challenging
Erik (slendergiant): I think I got them all though so at least that'll show I'm highly analytical and good and solving problems
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anyone who was at the Chestnut Hill shoot by chance find another one of these and have it?? I can't find the one for my right hand ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Erik (slendergiant): So neat feature I just discovered on my phone: the LED indicator blinks different colors depending on the app that has a notification, typically based on the color of the app.
Marisa (Weeb): future phone
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I used to have that.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I miss the advanced notification controls from Android.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I had every kind of notification on it's own sound, so I always knew what message I was getting,
Erik (slendergiant): Facebook is Blue, GroupMe is light blue, Discord is violet, Snapchat is orangey-yellow, and Instagram is just white lol

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WHAT IS IT?!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THATS SO CUtE
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I'm waiting on them to confirm cause I may not actually know~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Like I'm going to use the not weeby ones Google, come on~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): whoa where did you get those
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If you get the Gboard app (it's Google's keyboard) you can take a selfie and it will automatically generate them for you.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It also has a gif toolbar.
Jess (whoozica): That's where we did our engagement shoot
Jess (whoozica): It's the stairway to heaven boardwalk in vernon

Georgia (Something Sensible): GASP GUYS I DID IT LOOK
Georgia (Something Sensible): It got everything right about me wow
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I had to make my glasses square rather than oval, but I was otherwise impressed.
Erik (slendergiant): I downloaded it and I don't have that option???
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You need to go to stickers in the app itself.
Erik (slendergiant): Wheremst?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thatâ€™s the keyboard settings. It should have created an app on your home screen.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That app.
Erik (slendergiant): That's what comes up when I click th eicon
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Stickers isn't under preferences or advanced?
Erik (slendergiant): nope
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://lifehacker.com/how-to-turn-your-selfies-into-stickers-1828668706
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It looks like on Android the keyboard itself has all the menu options.
Erik (slendergiant): These are my options
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): do you have the specific gboard app?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also I think it'd be in stickets, the white square icon left of the black square.
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): that plus sign, then look for a create.
Erik (slendergiant): It's not an option
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): check for app updates?
Erik (slendergiant): maybe it's just not supported by Android yet?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It says it is in the article.
Erik (slendergiant): Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Android was crap at notifying me of updates, I'd check manually.
Erik (slendergiant): I downloaded the most recent version
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): ok, got it
Erik (slendergiant): I had to download Google Allo as well
Erik (slendergiant): ok never mind. still not the right thing...
Erik (slendergiant): fuck it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Lol I tried too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I can't get it either
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh well
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Erik (slendergiant): The problem is that the Mini icon doesn't exist for me
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): For the record, this is bothering me potentially more than it's bothering you.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Does anyone here know how to actually type? Like, all the fingers?
Erik (slendergiant): We learned it like almost every year in elementary school but fuck if I actually used it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I use like, maybe two fingers? Index and middle.
Erik (slendergiant): Good ol' Paws
