Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's too quiet in here today. Hope everyone's having a moderately tolerable day 💕
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's the life goal.
Jess (whoozica): tis modestly tolerable, even though i forgot my coffee at home
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof I'm sorry for your loss
Marisa (Weeb): F
Jess (whoozica): thank you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's moderately tolerable so far. Had no morning class so could sleep in some 👌
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's been a crotch-kick of a morning for me. One of our students posted a list of what he honestly thought of everyone in his grade on Discord. He thought it was anonymous, but it got out.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yikes
Mark (Mad Doctor): And my wife's car broke. And to top it off, Audrey is struggling with depression and anxiety again
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm so sorry. Sending love and good vibes your guys's way 💕
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thanks. Much appreciated
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn, I am sorry to hear that Mark. Hope your day/week starts to look up for the better ❤
Jess (whoozica): Oh no! that is definitely not modestly tolerable. Best of luck in everything! sending love!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thank you both. Weathering the storm sucks, but I know things will get better

Georgia (Something Sensible): You know at RTX two years ago I saw this one Jaune with really nice armor run past me
Georgia (Something Sensible): And he was like “fuck I broke my shield fuck fuck!” And he was running
Georgia (Something Sensible): And then he tripped
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMFAO actual Jaune?!
Jess (whoozica): DAMN he perf
Georgia (Something Sensible): I saw him later (conveniently I was in Pyrrha) and I was like “did you fix your shield” and he just started rambling about how it was such an important part of being Jaune and he felt stupid for breaking it
Georgia (Something Sensible): So that nameless boy. Him. He has the headcanon title lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Haha awww
Georgia (Something Sensible): He didn’t have a wig either, which normally I’m like y tho, but he was like platinum blonde
Rebecca (madameterralupus): When I'm back at school and on my computer I'll share what all of you in BNE are my headcanons for, how about that? 😝

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@227431823062466569> LOL I saw that article and considered it for a few seconds.
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I will never see that Jaune again
Georgia (Something Sensible): Well actually I saw him this past RTX but you can’t introduce yourself saying “hi I saw you fall last year and thought that was really in character, I’m ~~wise Rice~~ wezrez”
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sure you can.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just go up to him and say that then be like don't be ashamed I fell on my face when introducing myself to someone once too XDD
Halim (Greg): Most people would lead with their name in an introduction before an instagram tag but that does sound like 1 way to introduce yourself
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~I tell a lot of con people the handle first to keep them at bay and then introduce myself formally when I confirm they’re not weird~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Such as, the weird guy at Geekdom, that’s STILL messaging me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): WHAT?!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What weird guy?? Whomst I gotta fight
Georgia (Something Sensible): The hazel that was like “I use my skin condition for cosplay” and I was like uhhhh???
Georgia (Something Sensible): I stopped answering him so now his brother is messaging me on his behalf
Georgia (Something Sensible): He’s offered to buy me cosplay materials in exchange for friendship
Marisa (Weeb): wHAT
Marisa (Weeb): the skin condition for cosplay part
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Was in a Hazel cosplay that day?I feel I know who you are talking about
Georgia (Something Sensible): And also said he wants to “take my boyfriend/girlfriend and I out for dinner”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeee the hazel
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Imma privately DM you XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OMFG
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not that guy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:legasp:501968781883605002>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Geekdom was wild....quiet a bit of oddballs...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Geekdom was shitty.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like the one guy asking Georgia is he can play her a song XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jon showed up late on saturday and like his immediate response was "why is that guy following you around"  and i was like "idk because i smiled at him yesterday?"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It was shitty but friends made it greattt
Georgia (Something Sensible): “Can I serenade you?”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Truuu
Georgia (Something Sensible): I got a lot of “you ARE Pyrrha” comments too and those always make me feel weird
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like ah yes... I look like a 3D model... or I am dead... thank
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD
Jess (whoozica): did u guys see the dud that though i was his one piece waifu?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh dear
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): all of this at geekdom?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG Yes he was so weird. He was like are you Nami!? Oh you're not cause if you were I'd have to belike Nami-swaaaannn across the room XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I love Sanji from OP but cosplayers of him are always a bit out there....D:
Georgia (Something Sensible): I feel bad cause they’re not evil guys
Georgia (Something Sensible): Just make me reaaallu uncomfy
Jess (whoozica): YEA THAT
Jess (whoozica): I wanted to die
Rebecca (madameterralupus): True. They just are a bit too eccentric? Like they are nice just come off in a strange way
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also that shigaraki thanos dude
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Georgia (Something Sensible): And the cards against humanity dude!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG YES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He was making the game such a buzzkill...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like "Really guys? This makes no sense" .... Kinda the point bruh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO WHY WAS HE EVEN THERE
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cause he shoved his way in and we were too nice to say no XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "i hope you made a wise choice this time" -shakes head-
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "this offends me" THEN WHY ARE YOU PLAYING THIS GAME
Rebecca (madameterralupus): RIGHT?!
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Jess (whoozica): im so glad it want just me and tom thinking that XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): man, I missed out on a good time
Jess (whoozica): guess there were so many creeps
Jess (whoozica): im still recovering
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I did a lot of tongue biting that weekend. Between him and the waitress lady. I'm like bitches I've been a salty ass mood ya'll gonna make me snap XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): meanwhile: "FUCKING DEKU"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XDD the best
Georgia (Something Sensible): Everyone was each other’s girlfriend that weekend
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): gotta say, bakugo was a great cosplay for that con
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no weird creeps, could yell at people and not be judged
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): anger is in character
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ You right XD
Jess (whoozica): yo whenever i do a male cosplay i dont get creeped on and its amazing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The only time I've been fully creeped on... was my second con ever... and I was cosplaying America from hetalia... a boy.. WTF
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Not creeped on much as Harley who is very showy.. but America?~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have no problems chewing out people for anyone here. I just don't want to speak for anyone, so just give me some (easy to read plz) signal and I can scare off creeps or refuse strange, easily offended CAH players.
Jess (whoozica): damn i guess america is hot
Marisa (Weeb): you know it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~~make America hot again~~*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): omg XD
Jess (whoozica): im started too lose track of the creeper cound
Jess (whoozica): mostly cuz i try to block it out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Best solution.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Too many is the answer
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Same.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Actually Pyrrha got more creepers than Ochako despite only being in Pyrrha for like 3 hours 🤔
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Most have creeped on me in costumes I wouldnt expect to be creeped on.. and im just like what
Georgia (Something Sensible): Deku?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Nah like America, Anna, Panty (which makes sense)... uhhh
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I only got creeped on in Blake... by that one kid from Zenkai...
Jess (whoozica): is it possible to get creeped on as a couple? cuz i think that happened a few times
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pyrrha was late, they probably drank. Not to mention all the freakazoids come out at night.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There's a reason why I don't like hear of people conning alone, especially our fine ladies.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XDD It's cause the Bellabooty. 
And possibly Jess. I wouldn'tput it past people
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I havent been creeped on much cause I was always with male friends or my so...I mostly have gotten annoyance by comments repeated through out the day
Like people singing "do you wanna build a snow man", short jokes.. etc XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They get old...fast
Jess (whoozica): toms like right next to me 90% of the time and ppl still creep
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Just hide in my shadow.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I can literally fit you both~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao yes.I hide in Matt's shadow a lot or he stands guard. Like when I did harley the other year at zenkai every guy who took a photo with me he just lingered in the background monitoring them so they didnt try anything 🙏
Jess (whoozica): idk man i guess ppl see tom and they are like "he too twinky hes not gonna do anything"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Little do they know stormflower's blades aren't foam.
Jess (whoozica): hes silent but deadly
Rebecca (madameterralupus): After cosplaying for 7 years I've gathered an army of men who will protect me XD So I think I am set from the creepers lol
Jess (whoozica): i can pretend to be your girlfriend!
Jess (whoozica): 🤔  maybe that hazel thought i was <@!245270932602486784> 's girlfriend
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao. Also heck yes! More to my army of fake gf's! 
All of BNE girls we can be each other's fake gf's to help protect 😛
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also in the past: I've had less people creep on me and more people creep on my SO at the time... 🤔
Georgia (Something Sensible): Who said anything about fake 😘
Georgia (Something Sensible): But yeah probably Jess lmao
Jess (whoozica): NICE
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey had a guy try to get an upskirt shot at The Geekdom. She had another skirt and shorts on underneath, and she wasn't too upset, but still
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yo wtf!? 💢
Jess (whoozica): 😡
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Isn't Audrey a minor too??
Mark (Mad Doctor): 14 years old, yeah. Glad I wasn't around.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Soldier 76 would have gone all Overwatch on his ass
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I would have ripped him a new one as well. Like excuse me dude? 😠
Georgia (Something Sensible): I WOULD HAVE MURDERED HIM AUDREY IS PRECIOUS
Georgia (Something Sensible): Smart tho, the shorts underneath trick is always a good one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~flashbacks to Halloween~* agreed ☝
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *flashbacks to Halloween* Yes it was.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Geekdom is OFF the con circuit.
Halim (Greg): ~~be a commando bro in really good cross dress~~
~~give the perves a special surprise~~
Halim (Greg): ~~you trying to upskirt some poor girl have a dick~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://giphy.com/gifs/starwars-movie-star-wars-3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Shorts underneath is deff good. Just don't do booty shorts. They ride up and then serve no purpose 😂
Jess (whoozica): i do short for shirt except 2b cuz then it messes with the look ™
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My issue is even though booty shorts just end up serving no purpose cause they ride up cause that's what I end up stuck with cause all my shorts always seem to long 😫
Jess (whoozica): i use yoga shorts or biker shorts
Jess (whoozica): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071KQM4GN/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'll have to look into them. Sadly don't think I'll have time to donsor ANYC If do Shinoa. So booty vampire killer I be xD
Jess (whoozica): dese are super soft and comfy
Jess (whoozica): I can order you a pair on prime if you want and have them shipped to you if you paypal us?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I should have guessed when the RWBY loops had a 5 chapter update in one day.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Blake and Yang have finally gotten married.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~also Raven is about to have sign off with Qrow while Tai’s recording it due to the power of alcohol~~
