Evie (Katheryne Knight): WELP
Evie (Katheryne Knight): There goes my paycheck
Jess (whoozica): *goes to gym in cosplay*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~throwback to when that was already discussed~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WELP 
Just bought the whole Nora set and Raven T
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you won't need cosplays soon, just swag.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://petapixel.com/2018/08/31/polaroid-unveils-the-mint-2-in-1-instant-camera-and-mint-printer/
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I might actually like Andy and Erin more than Jim and Pam.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THANK YOU
Erik (slendergiant): I was never really a fan of Erin :/
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i feel like im the only person ever that hates jim and pam
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mostly jim though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): pams ok
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BUT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OK HEAR ME OUT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): pam looks like she definitelt smells like cats
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): As a sarcastic salt shaker, I have to relate to Jim a fair bit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): lol wwut? XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she looks like she has like 12 cats at home
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and smells of cat pee
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): faintly
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can see that cat lady look, sure...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Even if that's Angela.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): both
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but angelas like the high strung, obsessed with her cats, umbridge type
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and pam is like the  "i literally have no friends except for my 12 cats type
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): well, when she was with Roy yeeee...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She got better.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): true
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): slightly
Erik (slendergiant): The beach episode Pam really started to become her own person
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup, that's exactly the one I was thinking of.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im so thankful for that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): up until that episode i just could not stand her or jim
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): after that shes ok
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Can't say I hate Jim.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~no one hates jim, you're fine~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~literally only Leanna hates him~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~^~~
Erik (slendergiant): can I ask your reasoning though?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, like, he's terrible sometimes, but it's quality snark.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, dry humor is my jam.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hes just.... he is entirely too full of himself
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like he thinks hes better than everyone, as if he isnt also a paper salesman
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also just the fact that he went after pam when he knew she was getting engaged
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): even if roy is awful
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I feel like that comes from the way he's written, rather than who he is. His character for the show requires him to be that way.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also hes just like ...uncalled for rude
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): to everyone in the office
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): except for Pam
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): mostly Dwight.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, ye. All that true.
Erik (slendergiant): I do wish he hadn't kissed her while she was engaged
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That was the too far line. I get him saying "I am in to you, and I can't keep being that way" though. Unrequited love's a shit show.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Especially since he then left.
Erik (slendergiant): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, like if he had just SAID something
Erik (slendergiant): Like, I can relate to how much it hurts not to express those feelings and just keep them bottled up, but he shouldn't have acted on it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): then maybe i wouldnt think hes as bad as he is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but just how he acts in the show is like he feels entitled to everything
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ye, the act was too much.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i will admit, his jokes are funny, and i can see why people like him. but below the surface of funny jokes and messing with dwight hes just really shitty
Erik (slendergiant): Pam *clearly* had feelings for him but was basically in an abusive relationship with Roy and couldn't get out of it. Had things ended with Roy naturally, and they had gotten together in a less shitty way, then I think it would have been better
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i agree with that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though... if not for Jim, would she have found her way out of it?
Erik (slendergiant): also valid
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if he had spoken up
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): instead of acting
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i still think yes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's not naturally ending though.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no not naturally without interferance of any kind
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she was too timid at the beginning
Erik (slendergiant): I think it would have had to have been someone else. Like, there's no way for Jim to have intervened without it looking like he was just trying to get with her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea youre no wrong with that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But no one else was looking that close.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): exactly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so like either way it still wouldve been shitty.... but one option is less shitty than the other. Don't just KISS an engaged woman
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's a pretty deep arc. Surprisingly, now that I think about it.
Erik (slendergiant): and then there's Toby
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What, about how Micheal gives him crap?
Erik (slendergiant): now Toby also having a crush on Pam
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): aaaah, yeaaaah.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That felt pretty shoehorned.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YikEs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like it was just for the joke.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hard pass
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): toby is ....creepy
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (not Toby making a joke, the writers making a joke)
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/the-office-steve-carell-michael-scott-goEWraNuCucVi
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I still feel bad he gets bullied so much though.
Erik (slendergiant): Same
Erik (slendergiant): ~~not as bad as Jerry in Parks and Rec tho~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Considering his name is Garry?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He's such a great guy.
Erik (slendergiant): I thought it was Larry?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Real name Garry.
Erik (slendergiant): Terry?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh, you're making a point.
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/jXD7kFLwudbBC
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, I'm calling you out for being one of the Garry bullies.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): His wife and beautiful daughters would be disappointed.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *and then forgive you, and make you a christmas sweater*
Erik (slendergiant): bless the Gergiches

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im taking that as.....definitely a bad thing  WELP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): nnnaaaaahhhh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He got his own thing in the epilogue, despite being a minor character.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im looking at gifs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and unfortunately i feel like i definitely am this character. though he seems extremely annoying xD
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/jean-ralphio-parks-and-recreation-LLsI04bH2NKOQ
