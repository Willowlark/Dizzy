Erik (Red Riot Thot): Today I learned these two have the same English VA
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That doesnâ€™t compute in my mind
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A good boy and an asshole having the same voice... ðŸ¤” Hmmm
Matt (mattmyers25): Another example of the same v.a voicing 2 people. Asuna and zero 2 share the same Japanese voice actor. When zero 2 is happy I can here asuna in her voice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Same English voice
Marisa (Mawisa): Bakugo and Shin-ah (blue dragon from Yona) have the same Japanese voice. And I think Rin from blue exorcist? 
All Might is Scar from FMA
Todoroki is Yukine from Noragami, the protagonist of high school DxD, one punch manâ€™s speed of sound sonic, and also Attack on Titanâ€™s Eren
Rebecca (madameterralupus): All Might and Scar.. omg
Marisa (Mawisa): That makes sense given their voices but Todoroki/Eren and Bakugo/Shin-ah are some vocal talent
Jess (whoozica): LOL bakugo nd Shin-ah  ðŸ˜‚
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Two diff personalities XD
Jess (whoozica): Like todoroki and shin-ah I could see but bakugo?
Jess (whoozica): Voice actors are amazing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Same. Voice.
Marisa (Mawisa): Rubyâ€™s Japanese voice actress did both Shinoa in Owari no Seraph and Yumeko in Kakegurui. She also did Anya from Soul Eater Not which id attribute to being a good Weiss voice but Weissâ€™s Japanese VA did Rias Gremory and Kyoko from Dangan Ronda
Marisa (Mawisa): The USA only has like anime three voice actors. Itâ€™s gotten better in recent years but anything before 2012 itâ€™s impossible for Vic marinaraâ€™s name to not be on there
Marisa (Mawisa): bnha but every single teacher and guy in class A is voice by Vic, while villains and other guys take turns being voiced by Todd Haberkorn, Crispin Freeman, Chris Sabat, and Johnny Yong Bosch.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): omg xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Got throw in my man Travis Willingham and his wife Laura Bailey somewhere lol~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Oh yeah!! Theyâ€™re Maria and her dad from the movie
Marisa (Mawisa): Special guest appearance
Marisa (Mawisa): Shigarakiâ€™s Japanese voice actor *is* soul eater. Heâ€™s also done a ton of calm/sentimental stuff like hotarubi no Mori and Sunday without god
Marisa (Mawisa): Also Shigaraki is Russian yuri from yuri on ice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Speaking of Chris Sabat...
Matt (mattmyers25): Don't forget Bryce pappenbrook as well for voice actors used alot
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Super nervous for today and timorrow. Today I get some news about my transfer, and we start moving my room into the moving truck for tomorrow!! Tomorrow I move to harrisburg!!
