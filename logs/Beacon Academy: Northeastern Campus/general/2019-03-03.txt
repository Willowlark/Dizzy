Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm amused by the thought that the very same hall where Donald Trump gave his eccentric speech yesterday is the very same one we did the T-Pose dance in two weeks earlier. Surely it is a cursed space

Anna (loud and likely blonde): Catch me sobbing in the garment district because all the fabric holds too much potential for both me and my wallet to contain

Jamie (Jamie): i just realized a magical thing where I can reuse panels from the first version of my comic for the nexxt 2 episodes with some recoloring and style edits... like instead of having to redraw all of it that is still essentially the same scene. some things are being added for quality but im excited cause it means that much less time it will take to create the back log of episodes
Marisa (Mawisa): that's perfect because then when you make it big you can use updated panels as a selling point for the platinum edition of your book
Jamie (Jamie): this friends is why you save your layered files and dont destroy them when making them into postable images
Jamie (Jamie): lol considering the originals of the edited ones will stay in the v.1 folder on my computer not sure it will be a thing haha
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): So I walked into Bed, Bath and Beyond today. They had a big banner over the door that read "We have merchandise from your favorite teams." Underneath was a stack of doormats with bees on them ("Bee Welcome") . They weren't lying
Georgia (Something Sensible): Whatâ€™s the new bumble feature?
