Anna [Cyborg]: I'm in this bnha meme group on FB  and theres these two people who keep complaining on pics of redrawn vines/screencaps that they're low effort and 'uncreative' for the scene being taken from a vine

Dude it's a memes group none of this is serious.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thank you guys  ^_____^
