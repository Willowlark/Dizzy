Jess (whoozica): ooo 50" tv for 290 😮
Tom (tomukuncosplay): OoO
Jess (whoozica): real talk we should shop for a TV today on amazon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): shouldn't buy a tv online, unless you go to look at it in a store first.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gotta see what it looks like.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Prime day runs through tomorrow too.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Bill said not to so we must
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~Might try getting that bikini for Pyrrha~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So how is everyone today?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I could be better 😂 I got a massive headache, and my stomach feels icky. The heat wore me out Saturday...
Thankfully off work soon. Gonna go home and curl up in bed for the rest of the night lol.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > checks into hotel
> “how many keys would you like?”
> Fiv-Oh right. One. One key for my room with a king bed and no one else staying in it.
Erik (slendergiant): > You know what, could I maybe get like, 4 extra keys? I have a habit of leaving them in the room by accident *-chuckles nervously-*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Why lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you ask politely any hotel can give you 5 keys. They won’t do 6 usually though.
Erik (slendergiant): Ah
Erik (slendergiant): I've literally never checked into a hotel by myself so I legit don't know what's acceptable or not in terms of cramming people into a room...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, you don’t tell them you’re doing that.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sir I accidentally ate my key can I have 4 more
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~The joke is I have a room to myself and that's weird cause I'm always at cons when I stay in hotels~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm sitting across the street from my hotel, in an applebees, at the bar with my laptop going through my shoot with Georgia from the weekend, having food and drink brought to me as I feel like it.

If I was a photographer full time, this is how I would do all my post work. ~~Not that I would make enough money for that as a photographer.~~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: oh fuck prime day
