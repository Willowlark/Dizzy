Erik (Red Riot Thot): They've been $5 for at least several years because I just yeet a 20 at them and get 4 boxes
Marisa (Mawisa): sitting out front of wawa tryna sell them for $2.00. the golden days.
they don't even have the best flavors anymore they suck.
Marisa (Mawisa): have i ever talked about selling girl scout cookies at school
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What were the best flavors according to you?
Matt (mattmyers25): 
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~gonna go ahead and share anyway <:lenny:456549338026344489>~~

in middle school i would get pulled out of class when teachers wanted to buy cookies. it was freaky because the first time i got called out of English class by the no-nonsense super serious science teacher and I was like "*what did i do*" and he was like "i just really need some thin mint please" and I had a stash in my locker so i sold them to him.

in high school we also kept stashes in our locker but we had more girl scouts in the school and it was a decent sized school (~4000 students) so it was hard keeping up with demand. after school our troop leader would pull up in the parking lot and we'd sell cookies out of the back of her van when school ended.
Marisa (Mawisa): different regions sell different cookies based on whatever manufacturer is closer. cinna-spins were pretty good.
Marisa (Mawisa): i really liked lemon coolers. they've had a bunch of different lemon cookies since then but not quite the same.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oooh never had those
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But they look good
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay but FAIR
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yang deserves abs
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Late to the party
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Blake deserves to be sleeveless*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *...but not while they're in Atlas...*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Give the girlfriends abs and thicc stonk arms
Georgia (Something Sensible): I feel like I paid 4 dollars two years ago
Marisa (Mawisa): the $5 jump started happening gradually after 2015
Marisa (Mawisa): was definitely $3.50 like 9 years ago though
oh no we're old
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, yeah 2016 I think was when it switched to $5
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2015/11/03/girl-scout-cookie-prices-jumping-to-5-here.html
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Sometime between 2015-2016 so I guess not that long ago
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Now that I think about it, I think in college I'd yeet a 20 at them and get 5 boxes...
Marisa (Mawisa): superbowl sunday is the most profitable day for a girl scout
Anna (Cadmium): More important question who do you know that's selling em because I don't know anyone anymore and I need my Samoas
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Don't they camp out in front of stores on weekends by you?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I need me some of the peanut butter ones
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Tagalongs?
Anna (Cadmium): You think I leave the house on the weekend?
Marisa (Mawisa): do they still call them samoas? they changed the name of them here to Caramel DeLites like 10 years ago and it sucked
the peanut butter ones too. there were 2 different types and one used to be Tagalogs but they also changed it to peanut butter patties or somethin
Anna (Cadmium): Uhhhhhhh in NY they did
Anna (Cadmium): They kept them the same
Anna (Cadmium): Idk it's like regional
Anna (Cadmium): Wait those were from CT idk anymore
Marisa (Mawisa): yeah which SUCKS
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The names depend on the bakery they come from
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The order form I am looking at now has them by their old names still lol
Anna (Cadmium): Juliette Lowe would be sad
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think they go by caramel delights by me
Marisa (Mawisa): the bakery for our area sucked they changed cookies and names every single year it was so confusing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But I know some places have samoas
Anna (Cadmium): Do they have the lemon ones
Anna (Cadmium): Those were so good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Hit me up with all but samoas. I'll give those to anna
Marisa (Mawisa): lemonades? lemon sours? savannah smiles? there are a bunch of different lemon ones
Marisa (Mawisa): there was a fourth but they existed for one year. i can't remember their name.
Anna (Cadmium): Lemon coolers or something
Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH
Anna (Cadmium): Idk the ones that looked like lemon slices
Marisa (Mawisa): lemon coolers and savannah smiles are the same
Marisa (Mawisa): lemon coolers were the best
Georgia (Something Sensible): theyre split for the new jersey area i believe
Georgia (Something Sensible): i got tagalongs, tasted great
Georgia (Something Sensible): peanut butter patties, allegedly the same cookie? garbage
Georgia (Something Sensible): and as someone who was a girl scout for 12 years that price hike is cray
Georgia (Something Sensible): and _despite this all, if those girls show up with cookies at the rutgers bus stop like they always do im still gonna get a box goddammit_
Anna (Cadmium): Apparently it's unacceptable to tell girl scouts to "just fuck me up fam"

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I think it miiiight be a little more here but idk
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Dont fuck with snow. Iâ€™ve driven in a blizzard before, itâ€™s not fun.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah when we got that wierd snow in November it took me 3 hours to get home
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My Mom was stuck for like, 6 hours.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Did not like that storm either.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I was like... "I don't want to go to work tomorrow." We had a 2 hour delay. People complained.
Marisa (Mawisa): y'all ever get hungry? just experience the sensation of hunger? weird.
Jess (whoozica): crazy

Jamie (Jamie): Im exposed for being on my phone oh noes
Mark (Mad Doctor): So I just tagged my most recent ig post #bne. Now I have the Brisbane North East regional food bank following me. Thanks for the follow, guys, and I'm sure you do good work, but this may not be the content you're looking for
Anna (Cadmium): ~~we could raise money for a foodbank as a side fundraiser this year~~
Marisa (Mawisa): **CAN TOWN**
Anna (Cadmium): NO
Anna (Cadmium): side note? Slap a schnee would be a great fundraiser at a con
Anna (Cadmium): Like. A booth to pie annoying/hated characters
Marisa (Mawisa): ***it's for charity tho***
https://www.homestuck.com/images/storyfiles/hs2/00685.gif
Anna (Cadmium): I'm thinking like. Whitley, mineta, endeavor, Adam taurus, etc
Anna (Cadmium): Have a food drive booth where we accept cans
Marisa (Mawisa): pie gamzee
Anna (Cadmium): Yes
Anna (Cadmium): But honestly like. We could do that. $2 a pie and 3 for 5. Whipped cream or shaving cream
Anna (Cadmium): N the ppl playing the annoying characters heckle ppl
Anna (Cadmium): Long story short this is me avoiding how I spent literally my entire life being in organizations with fundraisers and philanthropies and now I'm not and I have no idea how to deal with this
Jamie (Jamie): CAN TOWN
Jamie (Jamie): And cinnamon roll mayor
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think money raised for Slap a Schnee should go to a women's shelter, given Jaques treatment of the women in his life
Anna (Cadmium): Or like. Foster homes
Anna (Cadmium): I just like being philanthropic
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You're shining too bright for my heathen eyes.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Where would you do Slap a Schnee? Con?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BNE con
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LmaO
Anna (Cadmium): Literal cosplay end goals is being able to consistently donate to Super ty which is a pediatric cancer organization from my hometown bc the kid loved superheros
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Super Tai?~~
Anna (Cadmium): I am also a heathen I have to even it out somehow
Anna (Cadmium): LMFAO nah they have a food website tho
Anna (Cadmium): Lol I mean. Does it count as having a booth and selling things. I bet a con would let us do that
Anna (Cadmium): As long as we cleaned up
Anna (Cadmium): We need someone to be thanos
Anna (Cadmium): All the asshole characters
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Since it'd be an outdoor thing, I don't think the con is the one to deal with.
Anna (Cadmium): I've done it indoors ngl
Anna (Cadmium): You just need to bring your own tarp
Anna (Cadmium): It's actually easy to clean lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Then you could do it as a panel, or maybe, maybe artists.
Anna (Cadmium): Only once did the f&s office give pikapp outdoor space so the rest were indoors
I feel it would be counted kinda like how maid cafes are counted
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oof spending a whole day at a con doing that though.
Anna (Cadmium): Nah but like. Getting a few hours
Anna (Cadmium): And rotate characters so no one sits in the chair for more than like half an hour at a time
Anna (Cadmium): I will make a mineta cap specifically for this to be done
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://lifehacker.com/how-to-secure-your-accounts-after-the-massive-collectio-1831835847 Another big data breach, check yourselves folks.
Anna (Cadmium): amazing. it got 2 of my emails
Jamie (Jamie): I made fire
