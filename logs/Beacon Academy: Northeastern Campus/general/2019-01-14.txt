Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So on top of con crunching, my friend just sent the setlist of songs we're playong for a gig the weekend after Katsu so I have 12 songs to practice as well üòú
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes. Sounds like gonna be a full schedule for a while lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You got this my dude.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ agreed. You got this~!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Luckily I already know a couple of them pretty well <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's good! üëåüèª
Jess (whoozica): You can do it!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): http://la-diavla.tumblr.com/post/181994801160
Anna (Cadmium): aw hell yes i thought i didnt have enough time at my job to request off for friday of katsu yet but I DOOO
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): üôå
Mark (Mad Doctor): I went through a rough six weeks before and after the holidays with health issues, family health issues, and two surprise economic hits. My sympathetic department head said "Dude, if you feel the need to take a day to regroup, we have you covered." I said "Naw, I'm good, but I think I'm going to need it on February 15..."  It's just an in-service day, so he was happy to accommodate
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Smooth.
Anna (Cadmium): very smooth
Anna (Cadmium): yea no i needed 10 pay periods before i got PTO
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I put in for Katsu, Zenkai, Next, Ota and CCE, as well as christmas eve through the new year, within 24 hours of coming off new years vacation.
Anna (Cadmium): i wish. i accumulate at a rate of 4hr/pay period
Anna (Cadmium): but i have to take off for katsu and toracon
Anna (Cadmium): cant take off monday after katsu rn unfortunately
Anna (Cadmium): oh waaaaaait maybe i can
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I get yearly PTO.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I carried over 6 days from last year too.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have Katsu and Zenkai confirmed. Waiting a little to put in for Otakon and CCE, but since I'm not doing RTX this year I'll have enough PTO for thise cons olus my 4 extra days of PTO (had five but my car needed fixed) 

Should have 4 days carry over unless I die or something
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My vacation accrues at 0.83 days per month üòÇ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They just introduced this new system in so everyone's kinda messed up right now
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Requesting vacation is very lax here. If it's one day it only needs to be a week ahead of time. If it's like several consecutive days then you're supposed to put in a month in advance.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): At least according to the handbook
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But no one really follows the handbook because this place is a mess
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yo that's nice 
They're more relaxed with floaters so... Hopefully it will stay this way for a bit
Mark (Mad Doctor): Zenkai falls on my spring break. It used to be Audrey's but now that she switched school's it's a school day. I sense a sudden onset flu coming in late March...
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Oh ye my boss is a 'in the moment' kind of guy so if I ask the week of it'll be fine, s'long as I don't have a critical project thing. I put in months in advance because he told me that if it's far enough in advance, it his job to make sure I have coverage for that date. üòè
Jess (whoozica): the handbook say6s "2 days notice" but if i actually did that each time id get "a talking to"
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I forgot we're moving to our new office today.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): It's just down the hall, but new.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So today's major distraction from work is watching bass covers of the songs we're playing for the gig and debating if I want to buy a bass off craigslis
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://images.craigslist.org/00909_gIGBHsr6VS2_1200x900.jpg

Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have like no wall space lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): rip nvm
Jess (whoozica): ~~ceiling~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I could put my electric back in its case under my bed and then put bass on guitar stand
Anna (Cadmium): buy the pretty shiny
Anna (Cadmium): listen to the crow brain
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm pretty pumped because a lot of the songs we're playing have some pretty great bass riffs

Mark (Mad Doctor): That's pretty much the soundtrack to my high school years.
Anna (Cadmium): u seem to think we'll convince you to not buy the bass but you came to the wrong ppl
Anna (Cadmium): also Meaghan (ruby from ice skating) said you guys were all awesome and really nice btw
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That bass new is like $400 sooo.... üëÄ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): impulse counter at the ready
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It's okay I feel that impulse buy I almost did yesterday
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what di you almost buy

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I know the ball is sat and I could do a formal Blake bit finding her dress is gonna be hard
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Friday evening is Cheongsam Neo for me tho
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like Katsu whyyyyy
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Cheongsam will probably get you in to formal.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Pretty Tyler's group ditched the ball for the rave, so they were probably same time.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Raves run longer too so.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that's kinda why I'd rather do rave. Also.more comfortable after wearing Winters Heels TM for 6 hours
Jess (whoozica): i didnt go last year so i kinda forgot it existed
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I'm not feeling the formal again myself. The whole thing was neat but I don't know how to dance, don't have a partner, so maybe I'll just hang around outside the thing for pictures of people looking snazzy.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): https://lifehacker.com/organize-your-schedule-by-mental-state-not-by-project-1831645301
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna do formal but I don't want to wear heels any more
