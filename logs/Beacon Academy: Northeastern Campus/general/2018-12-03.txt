Marisa (Weeb): my webtoon list has an uneven number again so the pretty grid is lopsided. someone give me 3 new webtoons <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): hey y'all what are some idioms and formulaic language that you'd often hear in a business presentation? like "ballpark figure," "learn the ropes," "pull through"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Are people still using "paradigm shift" and "outside the box"?
Marisa (Weeb): ooo outside the box would work. paradigm shift might be too complex. i'm making a fake presentation to use in a lesson plan for business people who might travel abroad and the theme is using formulaic language
Jess (whoozica): "lay of the land"
Marisa (Weeb): omg so regal. worthy of a ceo
Jess (whoozica): my one boss says it alot XD
Jess (whoozica): my other boss likes too say things like "we need to find out what will 'turn them on" but i dont think you wanna use that one
Marisa (Weeb): yes i will leave that out. yeah.
but i'll use "brush up on"
Marisa (Weeb): people say that right?
Marisa (Weeb): brush up on your disco moves
Jess (whoozica): ye!
