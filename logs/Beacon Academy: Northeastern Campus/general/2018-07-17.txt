Evie (Katheryne Knight): *Boops chat* Henlo~
Jess (whoozica): hewwo?
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Hewoo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): How is evewywon? OwO
Jess (whoozica): sleepy! 💤
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Same >_< 
I had coffee too.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Ditto on the sleepy 🙏
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I don’t want to have more coffee because its points on Weight Watchers and it might give me a headache >.<
Erik (slendergiant): dying... 🙃
Jess (whoozica): 😭  oh nooooo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!386874959009415170> why are you dying?? O.O
Mark (Mad Doctor): One small coffee is one calorie, as long as you drink it black without sugar. Starbucks,bof course, turns them into lethal milkshakes
Erik (slendergiant): too much going on at work
Erik (slendergiant): we go months with only a few requests for quotes and now all of a sudden we're being bombarded with them left and right
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!386567060026556417> I make mine in the morning ^_^ I use fat free flavoring and fat free half and half. It comes to about 2-3 points on Weight Watchers which isn’t bad. I drink water throughout the day which is 0 ^_^
<@!386874959009415170> oof...yeah you’ve been posting how stressful work is 😦
Erik (slendergiant): on top of having to make assembly procedures and prototypes and engineering change orders
Erik (slendergiant): RTX cannot come sooner
Erik (slendergiant): I need that week off desperately
Jess (whoozica): 🙏
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Meanwhile IBM fed me free bagel and croissant. Thanks Clients.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m heading into my second day of knowledge transfer, which is where I try and explain everything I’ve done in the last year to a guy. *I just want to sit and work in peace damnit*.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof 
Yeah I’m nervous but excited for RTX
Erik (slendergiant): Did you decide that you're still going? Or are you still on the fence about it?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep I’m still going. ^_^ 
I guess I’m just nervous because it will be a convention way far out from where I usually do cons.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’ve been telling myself I need to go to other conventions outside of PA, MD, and NJ, so this will be a good start. Plus Chris keeps stressing how sad he’ll be if I don’t go XD
Jess (whoozica): you'll probably have a good time once you get there and get settled!
Erik (slendergiant): I think you'll be fine. You'll be with plenty of friendos 😃
Jess (whoozica): I get the same way sometimes 😮 new stuff is scawy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep! I’m actually stoked because we’ll be staying a little extra after RTX so I’ll be able to enjoy Austin with people I consider my second family ^_^
Jess (whoozica): you'll have a great time! just gotta yell shut up to the voice inside your head saying otherwise
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~kinda secretly hoping Chris and I can have a 1 on 1 lunch or something OwO~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): why wouldn't you?
Jess (whoozica): Im sure you geys can find some alone time! ❤
Erik (slendergiant): just tell everyone else you want to have a one-on-one date with your mans
Jess (whoozica): YEET
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Do as Jess and Tom do and just disappear, or do as Georgia does and schedule a con date.
Jess (whoozica): YEA!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’ll just let the fam know “hey I wanna have a small one on one date and private time with Chris”
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): "Take the minigun with you"
Erik (slendergiant): I'm excited for the pre and post RTX Austin days because we're going to the Schlitterbahn water park the Thursday before and possibly Barton Springs Pool on the Tuesday after
Jess (whoozica): group text that shiz <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I can’t wait to have BBQ
Erik (slendergiant): literally my friend and my schedule is non-stop food
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Don't make yourself sick from all the fried food now Erik 😂
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yo I wanna make pancakes in the Airbnb badly
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I hope that can be a thing
Jess (whoozica): DO IT
Erik (slendergiant): Our restaurant list includes, but is not limited to: Bangers, Homeslice, Mighty Fine, Alamo, and much more
Erik (slendergiant): and we plan go get trashed on 6th Street xD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We are doing this BBQ place Chris won’t stop talking about 

I’m hoping to get a bit tipsy at this con XD Especially since I’m really not doing Photoshoots

Evie (Katheryne Knight): HELP ME STRUCTURE A PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ITS BEEN YEARS
Erik (slendergiant): sword/sword double combo slash attack
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Isn't Amity Arena going to be a crappy gatcha mobile game?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): From what I’m seeing and hearing no.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But IF IT MEANS PLAYING AS WINTER I WILL SELL MY SOUL TO SATAN
Erik (slendergiant): well, yes in that it is a mobile game
Erik (slendergiant): I want to suggest Taiyang so then they *have* to release his weapon and semblance
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): - "Reason to add Winter, you don't have to do what he said."
