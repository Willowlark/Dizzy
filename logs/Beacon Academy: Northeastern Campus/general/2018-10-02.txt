Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So did you know if you go to a dunkin in a shark kigu you get a lot of really weird looks
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Like even if its in a school student center
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You didnâ€™t learn this lesson at wawa?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): The people at wawa were actually very happy to see me
They said it was hilarious and way better than the usual type of ridiculous customers they get at 2 am
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I think itâ€™s the timing that really influenced their view
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Very likely
Marisa (Weeb): Is pasta sauce supposed to stain your hand
ZombieHunter: I like that hal apparently wanders around in Kohlâ€™s
ZombieHunter: Kigus
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): In my defense 
The dunkin is in the same building i rehearse in, and the shark kigu is for a show
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): And the wawa i was to lazy to get out of my comfy clothes and i was really hungry
Marisa (Weeb): THE ATMS ARE HALLOWEEN THEMED
The loading screen is a big graveyard with ghosts (probably of peopleâ€™s wallets) flying around

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Erik inspired me
Evie (Katheryne Knight):

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I need to wait until I get payed again but thatâ€™s okay
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Iâ€™m not going to a con any time soon XD
