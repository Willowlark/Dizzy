Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So did you know if you go to a dunkin in a shark kigu you get a lot of really weird looks
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Like even if its in a school student center
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You didn’t learn this lesson at wawa?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): The people at wawa were actually very happy to see me
They said it was hilarious and way better than the usual type of ridiculous customers they get at 2 am
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I think it’s the timing that really influenced their view
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Very likely
Marisa (Weeb): Is pasta sauce supposed to stain your hand
ZombieHunter: I like that hal apparently wanders around in Kohl’s
ZombieHunter: Kigus
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): In my defense 
The dunkin is in the same building i rehearse in, and the shark kigu is for a show
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): And the wawa i was to lazy to get out of my comfy clothes and i was really hungry
Marisa (Weeb): THE ATMS ARE HALLOWEEN THEMED
The loading screen is a big graveyard with ghosts (probably of people’s wallets) flying around
Tom (tomukuncosplay): THATS SO COOL.OMG
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Erik inspired me

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m not going to a con any time soon XD

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): American Eagle is having a big sale; 30-60% off everything, 40% "Fall Favorites" and clearance sales. 

This includes Flannels.
Jess (whoozica): oof still $25-30 even on sale
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, it's the new fall stuff.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Surprised it's on sale at all.
Jess (whoozica): thats why i always shop end of season
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): so you can look at the summer stuff on sale. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I didn't find anything I liked in clearance though, sad.
Jess (whoozica): ~~i already am ~~
but also i have alot of summer clothes already
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!229713389511901185> as the only other person who can appreciate this.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YAAAAAS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m so hype for the remix.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Chris is getting a switch
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m gonna be over at Chris’s a lot u til we move in
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): My life as a DE person going to UD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): While also having a sister who is freshman age
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Her high school friends randomly come up to me, say hi, then take a selfie to send her
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I dont know there names, i just know they know me throuhn her
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): They also apparently know my birthday
Jess (whoozica): senpai status
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Shit you right
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~more like onii-chan status~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~i dont want that status~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~but youre also not wrong~~
Jess (whoozica): maybe this sounds dumb af but, does anyone have a fool proof way to get line breaks in Instagram? Ive tried with white space thingy and the  bullet point thing but those dont work for me like half the time
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Emoji, no space following.
Erik (slendergiant): Make sure there's no space at the end of your line, then skip to the next line
Erik (slendergiant): You don't even need an emoji, just make sure no space
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The trailing spaces are probably what kill you; instagram's parser is sensitive to training spaces, it negates a new line.
Jess (whoozica): 😮 ooo ok ill try that, i dont like using emojis on all my posts
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is bad, (the dots representing space characters)
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That will render correctly.
Jess (whoozica): i took out the extra spces but it put them back?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think you need *something* on the blank line, just force instagram not to trim it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Editing may not work, might have to do it in first draft.
Erik (slendergiant): Works for me when I edit 🤷
Jess (whoozica): there we go, it worked in editing i just has do put the bullet point
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Was about to say, I see it worked.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that tag cloud though.
Jess (whoozica): instagram, why are you like this?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Write mine for me, I give up after like 8 tags.
Jess (whoozica): thats what the word doc is for, copy paste
Erik (slendergiant): My trick is predictive text xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pfft, the middle section of my cosplay posts? Where I say link in the bio?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That whole thing is in my predictive text. It only breaks because of the brackets and quotes.
Erik (slendergiant): I usually put my hashtags in a separate comment. Makes the original post cleaner *and* still shows up in the tag results
Jess (whoozica): ooo you fancy
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Find* this gallery under *“C*osplay Photography*”* on my site *(link* in the bio) or here:
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I only have to type the bold sections.
Erik (slendergiant): The downfall is that if I put too many tags then it won't post and I can only delete it so I have to redo it...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can't do that with the cross posting; cross posts wouldn't get the comment with the tags.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not that anyone tag searches facebook, but theoretically tumblr and twitter could get followers that way.
Jess (whoozica): yea max is like 30 for a post idk if its same for comment
Erik (slendergiant): I think it's 30 as well
Erik (slendergiant): But having a word doc or note to copy and paste from is smart
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I see you were having trouble. 🤣
Jess (whoozica): OMG IT DOES THAT?!
Jess (whoozica): omg thats so embarassing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It does that for everyone.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So if you ever edit a post you tagged me in 6 months ago, I get the notification.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Ironically I think it wouldn't tell me if you removed my tag, which would be a useful feature for people who want to remove credit on an image~~
Jess (whoozica): that is so embarrassing omg now im not gonna wannt edit ever
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Aaaagain, this happens to *everyone*, and I get tagged *alot*. Not something to be embarrassed over.
Jess (whoozica): *dies*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Now, for an actual reason not to edit, I read somewhere that insta cuts your reach if you edit the post within 24 hours.
Jess (whoozica): yea i know my ocd doesnt care though
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Fucking mood*
Erik (slendergiant): ~~if only they would bring back the chronological feed, then we wouldn't have this problem~~
Erik (slendergiant): http://www.itchban.com/blog/2017/8/23/dont-edit-your-instagram-posts
Jess (whoozica): i still hace no concept on how the feed works XD
Jess (whoozica): i wonder if it still nerfs your reach, since the article is from over a year ago, maybe they changed it? prob not tho
Erik (slendergiant): Hmm, Reddit seems to think it's just click bait: https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/7upkx7/this_site_says_not_to_edit_your_instagram_posts/
Jess (whoozica): plus i ussually edit like right away
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just listened to an episode of Jim Jefferies podcast which was four guys talking into a mic for 50 minutes after they clearly got fucked up in Vegas and decided to chill in the hotel all day.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s the fucking podcast I wanna be on. Just sitting in a room and talking for the fuck of it.
Erik (slendergiant): My friend wants to start a podcast like that. I think we might be doing our first one on Friday?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh nice!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I concerned that or blogging once when I was bigger into the seasonal anime.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But like, it’s awkward talking into Georgia’s vlog. It took me a few cons to get used to that. Doing a podcast alone in a room would be way worse than that.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Idk how to properly blog
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *vlog
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Or really properly do a social media XD 
I feel ya Bill
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My cat is trying to eat the curtains
Erik (slendergiant): I'd like to vlog but I'm afraid of recording in public
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve gotten lazy with insta.... I enjoy the vlog stuff, just need to get used to talking to myself in public. Definitely easier with someone else.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I use to vlog cons but I got to a point where I kept forgetting to pull out the camera so it'd be all over the place making no sense 😂 I wanna pick it up again though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Speaking of which... I made a YouTube video o3o and its not as awful as I thought itd be!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SO YAY
Erik (slendergiant): Oh right! Ben meaning to watch
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'll link it just in case anyone feels like checking it out xD 
https://youtu.be/nCwaQpmHddQ
Georgia (Something Sensible): Vlogging is fun! You guys don’t look at me weird when I do it 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh Georgia! What program do you use to edit your videos?
ZombieHunter: I wanna start CMVs
ZombieHunter: >.< once I get my next camera that’s the goal
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Same hunter
Georgia (Something Sensible): i pay for my software but its really user friendly and i get the yearly license
Georgia (Something Sensible): its 40 bucks for a year
Georgia (Something Sensible): Its called "Filmora"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh that's not bad for a year
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'll have to check it out, thank you
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Georgia you have literally recorded me teasing you while you're vlogging.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's in the Next blog.
Georgia (Something Sensible): but thats good natured!
Georgia (Something Sensible): you dont actually mean it
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~i think~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Course not.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just said I like doing them with ya.
Georgia (Something Sensible): its halloween 2nd and im really feeling the vibes
Georgia (Something Sensible): spotify has a halloween playlist
