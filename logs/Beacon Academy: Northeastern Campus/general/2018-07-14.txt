Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Time to take a class on speedlights for portrait photography. ~~Totally not for cosplay~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I didn’t say boudoir~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): “Taking portraits, not *Gramshots*”
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is that a thing? Do people say that?
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~no one says that~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Georgia (Something Sensible): im gonna abuse the heck out of that work ironically tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): also like what if you need gramshots tho
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Bill y u no live closer
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Why U no live closer?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This guy is old, that’s probably where he got the word from.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Georgia (Something Sensible): those MILLENIALS and their GRAMSHOTS
Evie (Katheryne Knight): BACK IN MY DAY
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WE HAD TO. PAINT. PICTURES OF OURSELVES
Georgia (Something Sensible): omg
Georgia (Something Sensible): WE HAD TO LOOK IN MIRRORS
Georgia (Something Sensible): we HAD NO ***FILTERS***
Mark (Mad Doctor): I CHISELED MY LIKENESS INTO THE WALLS OF CAVES!!! ( I used the deer filter tho. That's adorable)
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The model was late, I should have brought one of you along. 😏
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Unfortunately this is more studio style just using speedlights. Boo.
Georgia (Something Sensible): whats studio style mean
Georgia (Something Sensible): and does that mean youre not getting any SICK TIPS?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s interesting. Always things to learn. But I don’t own flash stands, soft boxes, multiple off camera lights...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That kind of studio setup.
Georgia (Something Sensible): flash stand is thing on the left?
Georgia (Something Sensible): and soft box is thing on righT?
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~these are total guesses~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Powder on face can reduce glare spots on skin? I think?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Flash stands are all the stands, there’s no soft box in the picture, there’s an umbrella reflector on the left stand with a flash, on the right is a hanging reflector.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And there’s a background behind there.
Georgia (Something Sensible): fAnCy
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This guy has a light specifically for hair.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Boy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oof
Jess (whoozica): Can confirm, allready a meme.

Tom: "I'm gonna take a picture for Instagram"
Me: "For the 'gram?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): idk when i hear gramshot i just imagine someones grandmother doing a shot and then winking
Georgia (Something Sensible): like thats the mental image i get
Jess (whoozica): Lmfao
Jess (whoozica): I often call it the instagramma
Georgia (Something Sensible): me, when im old and still hip
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Guy next to me is flipping through Instagram, he’s got cosplayers in his feed. 😏

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Guys in minimum late 30s. Make that 40s.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mark’ll be jealous if I get another cool old friend. 😆
Georgia (Something Sensible): still could be a good person to talk to about _knowledge_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This kid volunteered when the model still wasn’t here.

Mark (Mad Doctor): Forget it. My walker is all the way on the other side of the room
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nah, dis guy had that like “I take cosplay photographer super seriously” look.
Georgia (Something Sensible): how does one even take cosplay photography seriously
Mark (Mad Doctor): Find cosplayers who aren't goofballs. Good luck
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You’d know the type if you saw him.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Me and my generic magical girl weapon. 😂😂😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tripod I ~~impulse~~ bought has a monopod mode.
Georgia (Something Sensible): MAGICAL BILL
Mark (Mad Doctor): NONE SHALL PASS!...the area taped off for photographers
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It doesn’t get super high, max high is probably a little under 6’, but it’s so LIGHT and it compresses down to basically the size of my forearm.
