Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right??? XD This has happened to me with numerous people I have friend within the past year XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Going through my old con albums and I came across this.... peep that one and only time I did a Homestuck cosplay. I had barely even read the comic too 😂 
RIP ME
Marisa (Weeb): O I remember you at konkon!!
Marisa (Weeb): I was just playing homestuck 
Homestuck cosplay group when
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMFAO. Oh dear lord
Jamie (Jamie): Shit i still have my knight of time cloak okay xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I gave all my stuff to a friend :X
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also who here was a Hetalia fan (other than Jamie, I know she was).
Jamie (Jamie): 
Jamie (Jamie): *was never worn to a con and was the better of 2 homestuck cosplays i did*
Marisa (Weeb): we did sailor homestuck cosplays at zenkai once
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That photo was when some guy was doing a dance video Jaime.
Marisa (Weeb): OH YEAH did they ever upload that dance video?
Jamie (Jamie): *jamie
Jamie (Jamie): And shit i forgot about that and never did see it get posted
Jamie (Jamie): I remeber them telling me not to actually sing and i was like but why
Marisa (Weeb): I think I’m evenly tied in number of characters cosplayed for rwby, homestuck, and love live
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah that was odd
Jamie (Jamie): Let the people sing!
Marisa (Weeb): What was the song, All I want for Christmas is you?
Jamie (Jamie): Yea i think so?
Marisa (Weeb): OH WAIT I’ve cosplayed more homestuck than anything lol whoops
Marisa (Weeb): Homestuck rwby group when
Jamie (Jamie): XD I have still a shit ton of homestuck au designs i would still do honestly
Jamie (Jamie): Yes i'd do it
Marisa (Weeb): *lets do it*
Jamie (Jamie): 
Jamie (Jamie): *two designs i would still attempt if i mad espace for them lol*
Marisa (Weeb): omg that nepeta is adorable
Marisa (Weeb): christmas homestuck konkon 2k19
Marisa (Weeb): some people's derse dreamer cosplays are super intense like that gown
Jamie (Jamie): You mean like the ruminov designs that are to die for? Comparable to the Alexander ones
Jamie (Jamie): Hannah alexander?
Jamie (Jamie): Ruminov didnt do finished art like that vut the designs damn i wanted to do roxy's so bad but i was such a new cosplayer at the time
Jamie (Jamie): 
Marisa (Weeb): yeah!! the peeps like this
Marisa (Weeb): 
Marisa (Weeb): i met rumminov and didn't realize it once she's so adorable, she was cosplaying a fantroll
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mostflogged~~ 💕💕💕
Marisa (Weeb): cosplay goals
Marisa (Weeb): here's rumminov, on the left
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay, have fun with ya homestuck chat girls. I got work P much all day soo ✌🏻
Jamie (Jamie): Omg seriously? Lucky and yea those who did that level of homestuck cosplay are what made the fandom beautiful and inspirational to be in and then you had the people not sealing paint lmao
Marisa (Weeb): enjoy ur work have fun be safe
Marisa (Weeb): homestuck cosplay has really died i'm super interested in doing it again now oops
Marisa (Weeb): i wonder if feferi still fits me
Jamie (Jamie): Its sad people shit on the fandom so bad now since most (tho not all)of the active people are the ones people complained about who are loud and make too many bucket jokes
Marisa (Weeb): yeah ; - ;
homestuck really got overshadowed by the few fans who were horrible. it kind of happened with steven universe but nowhere near the extent that homestuck got shamed
Jamie (Jamie): Honestly i still have the partially dont nepeta cosplay i had been working on including cute fluffy paw shoes
Jamie (Jamie): Yea its so bad for homesick fandom that its almost like saying i like to pick fert if you say you like homestuck.
Marisa (Weeb): maybe i could cosplay trizza. i wonder if enough people would recognize her. i could use fef's horns and not have to make another huge wig. or I wonder if my mother still has her condesce cosplay
Jamie (Jamie): I will say the ending dissapointed me greatly with too many questions left unanswered
Marisa (Weeb): yeah!! hussie said there would be an epilogue but because the money from the kickstarter got stolen and there was th mess with the game, it really set a lot of stuff back and the fandom died off
Jamie (Jamie): *is jealous of y'all whos parents join in with cosplay since my mom is a fan of seeing the things i make and my dad actually said i looked like a clown once lol*
Marisa (Weeb): ***what***
dress ur dad up as a clown then see who's laughing
Jamie (Jamie): Woah wait the kick starter money was stolen? I never actually heard that
Jamie (Jamie): Also if i ever catch wind of the game finally ever coming out I am still buying it lol
Marisa (Weeb): yeah!! it was a huge mess.
Hussie wanted The Odd Gentlement to make the game--
Oh it's out already!! The first part has been out since last year!!
Marisa (Weeb): It's being released in acts like homestuck was
Jamie (Jamie): *WTF*
Marisa (Weeb): so TOG was supposed to make the game. After like a year though, all they had made was a super super basic single room and like 2 character models
Marisa (Weeb): hussie was like "hey what's going on with the game"
Jamie (Jamie): welp I never caught wind of it lmao
Marisa (Weeb): and they were like "yeah we're totally working on it!" but actually, they took the money to make the new King Quest's game instead. so when Hussie said "ok nevermind, I will make this game myself, give me my money back" they didn't have the money. he only got like a fraction of what there originally was.
Marisa (Weeb): so Hussie and WhatPumpkin went and formed their own game studio with only the most trusted people they knew. hussie had to learn game programming from scratch. the creator of undertale also helped. i think there was a rumor that undertale was made in hussie's basement while working on the homestuck game
Jamie (Jamie): Wow did the hussie lawyers go on attack after? I hope so cuz i remember that being alot of friggin money raised
Marisa (Weeb): i can't recall, i would think so but something wasn't in his favor. like the contract had a stipulation that prevented him from getting the money or it was too expensive and he didn't want to use more money
Marisa (Weeb): here's the site though! they made an extended zodiac quiz and introduced a ton of new trolls that will be in the game
Marisa (Weeb): https://www.hiveswap.com/
Marisa (Weeb): it's really neat
Jamie (Jamie): I need to look this all up tomorrow cause damn and i will check the gamr out too lol
Jamie (Jamie): But i need sleep so must pull away from the talk of homestuck lol
Marisa (Weeb): good night! I'll post some good writeups from tumblr that explain the situation better
Marisa (Weeb): https://rafr.tumblr.com/post/123244412225/the-odd-gentlemen-robbed-us
Marisa (Weeb): It seems like WP and TOG settled in court
Jamie (Jamie): I shall ha e a good read of them with my morning coffee lol 🌙 night~
Marisa (Weeb): tw

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Do it!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Fuck now I’m interested in doing Homestuck cosplay 
I’ve been interested for years but because of how “cringy” it was and the fact that my first ex and his girlfriend cosplay from it I kinda avoid it.
