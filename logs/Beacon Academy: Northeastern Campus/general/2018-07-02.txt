Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): http://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1516596&m=63712&afftrack=kinjadeals-main%20&urllink=www.sunglasswarehouse.com%2F anyone need sunglasses for ~~beach cosplay~~ the summer?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 30% sale.
Jess (whoozica): heart shape glasses for nora? or just pink?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I feel like Nora is more subtle than that.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if by sumbtle you mean "hammer shaped glasses"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): then yes
Jess (whoozica): DOES THAT EXIST i dont think that exists
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they dont :c
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): these do though LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jess (whoozica): OMGGG lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need those for when I do Denki from BNHA XDD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ˜‚
Jess (whoozica): y does that exist is the question XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OMFG YES
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Team instinct what
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ‘€ yes
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): > listens to Caffeine on the way back from lunch
> just pictures a CFVY video of slow mo walking into the convention center through double doors that blow open to let them through
> too bad it's impossible to get every member of CFVY cosplayed in one room
Evie (Katheryne Knight): True.
Some of my friends and I are trying
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I mean Tim can always be counted on.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He has Fox AND coco which is nice and Peter might have a Yatsuhashi in the future and I plan on being Velvet and we have Vincent as coco as well
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Between him and Vincent there's Fox and Coco. Yatsu is up in the air as always, and we don't technically have a pocket Velvet.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There you go, it'll *finally* happen.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *We were so close at Katsu. So close*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I asked them if they ever wanted to do a full team CVFY at Katsu let me know so I can get Velvet together
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It would be like, first ever.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We ALMOST had it last Katsu 
We had no Velvets Friday but Yatsuhashi
We had ALL THE VELVETS Saturday...no Fox or Yatsu if I remember correctly.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I canâ€™t remember if tim did Fox on Saturday.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't think so.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Saturday was a shit show anyway.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh fuck yeah it was
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If itâ€™s gonna be that way next year I might not go to the RWBY shoot
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I could *taste it* friday. We were so close, how did we not have a single bun?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): was saturday a shit show for everyone this year?? xD or just the rwby shoot?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Katsu is a shit show~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Just the RWBY shoot for me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cause my saturday was hell.. then again i couldnt see anything because 2b blindfold
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and sleet
Jess (whoozica): i was toobs too that day. i stopped by the rwby shoot and i was like "RIP friens"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Multiple people called me out on looking really stressed. It was too crowded to do all the shoots I was trying to do and I just burnt out. Taking over the calling for the RWBY shoot was crazy and it just got nuttier.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I had fun but it was a hot mess. The RWBY shoot that is. 
I had the best Katsu Iâ€™ve had since 2014 this year
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If the people who ran last year's run the official one this year, consider skipping (at least if you want photos, to chat is probably cool still). A friend of Reiley and Georgia's ran the friday one, it's why it didn't suck.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'd have had more fun if I didn't try to be Katsu Photographer Man. Fuck that, next year I'm not doing a single shoot after 11am and only going to hang out.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thatâ€™s a good idea
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeet.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So I hate on instagram for being implemented pretty terribly. Often.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Such is being a software engineer using it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I should give it props for not giving me notifications like this.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *These people already like my page, why are you telling me to harass them*
Erik (slendergiant): obviously they don't like it *enough*
Jess (whoozica): Yea! I just noticed that on my works Facebook too
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I hate my facebook page, which is ironic because it's the first thing I had for photography.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Now Instagram is my primary (such is getting involved with *instagram famous* people) and I use my own site with flickr image hosting as my internet presence.
Erik (slendergiant): I've always found facebook pages to be such a pain which is why I just stick to Insta
Jess (whoozica): i have to manage social media pages for work but we are really bad it ðŸ˜‚
Jess (whoozica): insta is pretty easy though
Erik (slendergiant): our company has a hard enough time maintaining its website
Erik (slendergiant): we got hacked by Russian hackers a few weeks back ðŸ˜‚
Jess (whoozica): OH that happened to us too!
Jess (whoozica): and when i tried to tell my boss he was like "i dont understand why this is important"
but eventually we got a new site thank god
Jess (whoozica): I save memes to my desktop at work alot so i can share them and then i delete them all later but i had a heart attack cuz i thought i attached a meme to an email to my coworker with my boss copied ðŸ˜±
Erik (slendergiant): *WHOOPS*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Facebook pages are annoying to manage cause they get like no views... ðŸ¤” also not as easy to find like insta lok 
. I only ever like update mine when I remember. It's basically where I keep all my photos nicely sorted by costume xD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I use If This Then That (IFTTT) to automatically cross post.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I only ever post to instagram, IFTTT posts to Twitter and my Facebook page, and I use instagram's cross post to post to tumblr.
Erik (slendergiant): Can't you just post directly from Insta to FB and Twitter?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I hate FB pages with a burning passion. Iâ€™m not paying money to get views you fucks
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Which is a free service, for anyone who wants automated posting.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Facebook integration stopped working awhile ago, I only recently noticed. Twitter still works, but...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That was generated by IFTTT
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This was generated by instagram.
Erik (slendergiant): The thing that annoys me about IG's crossposting is that if you have a multipicture post, it only sends the first one. At least to Tumblr it oes
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): One looks better than the other, for the like, one person that follows me on *twitter(.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My issue with posting to Twitter is that it posts a link rather than a photo
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, it's not like instagram wants you to use other social networks.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): IFTTT can make it a photo post Gen.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But, it direct copies your caption. So if you put hashtags at the bottom and it's longer than 140 characters, it gets cut off.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Depends on how much you care. I have the other network accounts to 1. reserve the username, 2. give a theoretic person looking to follow me access to do so in the most convenient way.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't do it for the reach. I don't expect any, so I don't try that hard.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Oh hey Gen has been posting and tagging me in stuff on Twitter so there's that~~
Jess (whoozica): ive just gotten used to posting to insta at least 3 times a week. i dont need any more responsibility XD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> was this not brought up?
Jess (whoozica): i accidentally cross posted a CCE photo from last year to facebook and a bunch of my family member were like "why are all these half naked women beating up you husband"
Erik (slendergiant): *I just set up a new IG for art RIP*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeeee rip you.
Jess (whoozica): and co workers too XD
Tom (tomukuncosplay): *fun fact*
Erik (slendergiant): I feel like Twitter is the platform that's easiest to get a reaction from people like VAs and stuff
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ```Service   | Followers

Georgia (Something Sensible): Huehue
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Small Georgia pictures!
Erik (slendergiant): I made a new tumblr for cosplay but it's mostly become shitposting
Erik (slendergiant): I made a twitter back when it first came out, like before it really even took off. Never used it because of that and then it took off and I was like screw it

Tom (tomukuncosplay): *see I dont feel the age gap til i do dumb things like this*
Erik (slendergiant): *I haven't even known her a year yet aaaaaaand I often forget there's a 5 year gap...*
Tom (tomukuncosplay): ~~yeeeeeeeee

Tom (tomukuncosplay): ~~and I was a late bloomer aghhhhh~~

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I go through spurts where I forget I have a tumblr for weeks-months and then when I do remember I post a bunch on there like daily ðŸ˜‚
As for my Twitter... idk why I have it. I never post my own stuff, just retweet things and raven then barely.
Instagram is the site I use the most/post the most on. Aside from my personal private fb account
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): My tumblr is Literally 100% shitposts.. like hundreds of pages of straight up shitposts
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I was never big on tumblr. As far as I k ow tumblrs are either porn or shitposts.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Better to be shitpost.
Matt (mattmyers25): Or spoilers
