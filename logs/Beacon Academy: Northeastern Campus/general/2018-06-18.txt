Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like, ebooks about photography is super interesting, but a good portion of them are for running a business (which I don't) or too low level; though it feels weird to say I'm beyond that.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Only so many times you can read a photography 101 course before it's the same shit, different day.

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Itâ€™s annoying to me because itâ€™s just unwanted comments and he does it on every photo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But at the same time Iâ€™m not worried about it he finds me at a con because 3/4 of my friend group are folks who are 5â€™10 and taller, and folks who go Mom friend on their asses.
snow ( crescentbladed ): Iâ€™m 5â€™3 and weak but Iâ€™ll still protecc
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): You could block him
snow ( crescentbladed ): Thatâ€™s another good idea
