Marisa (Weeb): My professor was mid-lecture in the middle of an explanation when he looked at the clock and said ‚Äúoh no I have to go‚Äù and immediately shut down the computer and left within like 6 seconds
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is your teacher Aizawa?! XD
Marisa (Weeb): <:lenny:456549338026344489> actually...
Marisa (Weeb): ~~no rip~~
Marisa (Weeb): I have pictures of official stuff each character might have with them (it was outside displays of their rooms) and it‚Äôs a fun guessing game if people want to try it.
Marisa (Weeb): There‚Äôs 9 room items and then 3 gym lockers of all different characters.
Erik (slendergiant): Yes plz
Marisa (Weeb): I don‚Äôt wanna spam all the pictures so I‚Äôm gonna wash some dishes and then make a collage of them and post it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh yeaa I wanna see it!! üíï
Jess (whoozica): YES
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay so you know that poll thingy? There was the question whether your single or taken and two people voted single...
HAVE THEY SEEN MY INSTAGRAM???????
Erik (slendergiant): My friend answered all of mine incorrectly on purpose to be a dick üòÇ
Jess (whoozica): NICE
Jess (whoozica): i kinda wanna do it but I feel like all mine are so obvious XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeaaaah some I was like ‚ÄúWow really?‚Äù
But I‚Äôm still floored that anyone thinks I‚Äôm single...Two people. I hope they were trolling XD
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Gen: Does a fan sign, with Chris, of them in a couple cosplay, for the two people who thought they weren't a couple
Evie (Katheryne Knight): SHOULD I THO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I‚Äôm hella tempted
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): The fact that I put it in green text format means I'm being sarcastic and it's *probably* a bad idea.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Me: CHris grab your Qrow wig we gonna learn them@a thing
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): It's just a series of frames of you guys doing the winter qrow thing; from the 'stupid bird' to the awkward looks to the first kiss, to the more kissing, to the falling out of view of the camera. 

And in the background of each is a fansign. for each of them. Clearly visible.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Please stop feeding me bad ideas
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I got a tripod for my phone like I can make this happen
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I am good for nothing else.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He‚Äôs coming over after work like
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof

Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): What I'm always doing.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We should have a Bill Giving Bad Ideas counter
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Technically it's more like I'm projecting my salty nature for your benefit.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XDDD
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Deku uses 10% of his power to punch, I use 15% of my saltiness to channel it to others.
Erik (slendergiant): Bill's quirk is *Salt Manipulation*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): PFFFT
Erik (slendergiant): *Salt For One*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yo what is everyone‚Äôs quirk in this group
Erik (slendergiant): *Social AAnxiety*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Salt Projection. The failing point is if I'm ever not salty I can't make salty scenarios.
Jess (whoozica): extreme sense of smell XD
Jess (whoozica): i have like a really sensitive nose so tom and i decided that was my quirk the other day
Marisa (Weeb): Super fast reactions. Nothing would go over my head. I would catch it.
Erik (slendergiant): My quirk is just *Tall*
Marisa (Weeb): Also I‚Äôd probably have like 6 ears or some weird mutation
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Hershey's chocolate is better than Meiji.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Sorry japan.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have no idea what mine woild@be

Marisa (Weeb): or i guess number zero
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I LOVE IT
Marisa (Weeb): Here we gooooo

some of these answers will be super obvious if you read japanese haha oops
if people get stuck i can give hints or you can try to talk it out. hints will be stuff like what the items are if it's not obvious, or what they say, or hints from the show that could point to the character.
if you request it i can tell you how many you get right/wrong.
sorry i didn't get a good pic of #1 but it might be obvious whose room it belongs to. also i put a filter over number 12 because the original was harder to see.
