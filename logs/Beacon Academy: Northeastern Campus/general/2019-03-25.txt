Evie (Katheryne Knight): We'll find a way to fit everyone
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also yeee I need to have more group hang outs at my house lol. I can't fit a lot of people I'm just dumb and never have people over and worry my parents won't want them over yet they tell me to have people over all the time xD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YAAAS and I'd be down cause my friend Jamie also lives in Lancaster
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 2019: the year us more local to one another people need to hang out more lmao
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We can go to Issei and not die from weeb overload
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I do need an excuse to go to landcaster, US's best archery store is in landcaster and I need new arrows.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Gotta get your Link game on
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is it Lancaster archery supply...? 👀 cause that's like right next door to me almost lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fun fact, I shot at a national tournament.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Noice!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I placed worse than 10 year olds.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I was there!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ehhh who cares where ya placed as long as ya had fun~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fun fact on the fun fact, it was at JMU which iirc is where Casey Sanders went to school?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey but you went
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And did the thing
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OMG I JUST CAME UO.WOTH A GREWAT IDEA
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WOULD ANYONE WAMMA DO A BNE DND CAMPAIGN
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Sorry my mind just thought of this
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you mean with *30* players.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *The encounter balance*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's like.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): O w O
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 30 level 1 characters versus a Tarasque.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): PPFFFFDDT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We'd win unless we all Nat 1'ed
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If a Bard, a Fighter, a Paladin, and a Warlock of level 6 can go up against an encounter level 10, 30 level ones can take out a Tarasque
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh that's a little match.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tarrasque is a CR 30.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof it would all depend on if someone broke their character and rolled high for stats
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's what happened with our fighter
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The damage immunities of a Tarrasque are pretty much impassible by first level characters. XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof yeah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): A dragon is a lower CR but one AoE and Y I K E S
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shit fam u rite
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m a mean dm cause I like that fear of death in combat. At least running DND.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I like less number crunchy systems these days. Which also aren’t genre locked. ~~RWBY translate well to Fate~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And cause that will confuse you, totally different Fate.
Mark (Mad Doctor): For a week I rode the train w one of my nerd student who told me how he soloed a tarrasque. "First, I gave myself fifties in all my stats..." Never came closer to jumping off a moving train.

Seriously, I'd be down for a dnd group. I was seriously thinking about suggesting this myself.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Late to the message but BNE DnD campaign?? Yes plz cause I really wanna play DnD 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So would anyone oppose to me inviting my one friend to some events in the future ~~not any sleep over ones but other things.~~ he's a cool dude but kinda shy so doesn't really branch out much to talk to other cosplayers to make new friends.
Mark (Mad Doctor): No objections here. Anyone we might know through social media?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think you might follow him Mark cause he said he recognized you when I was going through insta at dinner lol. FrozenWaffle Cosplay
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oh, yeah. I met him at Zenkai. Nice guy. We talked about his WWII reenacting
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee him!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): FEM JOKER IS BAE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *theories of it being a re-encarnation of FeMC from p3p rising in my bones*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): OwO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I love her and I'm cosplaying her
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ya'll can't stop me
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *theory you say?*
Jess (whoozica): di-did they put a fem joker in the game?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I think 
It's looking like it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And my God I'm cosplaying her
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She looks like the FeMC from p3p
Evie (Katheryne Knight): With longer hair
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They're announcing the remastered version. The remastered of Persona 3 for psp had a female protagonist.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Persona 4 ~~sucked~~ had some new cast member.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YES IT DID
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): People are hoping it's fem joker, and all the fanart I'm seeing makes me believe an actual art was released.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Fuck Marie
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I love her VA but f u c k Marie
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She was the worst addition to a game
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I like Persona 4 but 2,3, and 5 are leagues above it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Naoto and Kanji are the only characters that matter
Evie (Katheryne Knight): For me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh and Adachi
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/03/24/persona-5-the-royal-announced/ character confirmed, who she is has not been.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I saw and AAAAAAAAAAAAA
Evie (Katheryne Knight): AaaaaAAAAAAAAAA
Evie (Katheryne Knight): https://youtu.be/yBLdQ1a4-JI
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I *pray* it's a fem Joker.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I want her to castrate...*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): uh...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): fuck, what's his name.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): evil teacher.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Make her fem joker ~~so I can date Ryuji~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Kamoshida!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Please let me date Ryuji
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Please God let me date my good boi
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *let Ryuji say fuck*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~and Iwai~~ 
Cause if you can date the teacher I can date the gun dealer
Evie (Katheryne Knight): LET RYUJI SAY F U C K
ZombieHunter: I’m dying
