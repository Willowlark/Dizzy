Rebecca (madameterralupus): Now that I finished my inktober guess it's time to do my homework since I neglected it all day >.<
Marisa (Weeb): ew homework
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Deff. Thankfully it's only one page I have to write... but still eww writing papers D:
Marisa (Weeb): my class was cancelled today yehaw
now i dunno what to do though i am lost without school
Marisa (Weeb): what's the paper on?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Explore the town? Lol
And Narrative Paradigm and how it fits into some scene of an old ass movie XD
Marisa (Weeb): ewww
YEAH i kind of want to go exploring but i gotta plan stuff meticulously i can't just *wander* ahh
I'll probably go to karaoke to vent some steam since it's like $1 an hour for individuals before nighttime, and then wander around skytree? i can enter the aquarium for free and i just found out it's open until 9pm omg. everywhere else closes at like 5pm.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): owo All sounds pretty fun. 
I don't think I ever asked but where in Japan are ya based at atm? 😮
Marisa (Weeb): tokyo! basically asakusa, i'm about a 10 minute walk north of Sensouji temple
Marisa (Weeb): ~~all of tokyo and i'm too scared to explore rip~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh neato!! I figured when ya said Skytree that was it but wanted to be sure lol. 
I am sure you can deff find something fun to do and occupy your time with there then XD
Marisa (Weeb): ye come and visit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol if only D:
Marisa (Weeb): i'm also within walking distance of ueno park which has a ton of museums/the zoo/entertainment stuff but. most non-shopping stuff closes at like 5pm.
Marisa (Weeb): i can walk to fabric street but that is too dangerous. too much inexpensive fabric.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> Homework done woo!
And ohh the park sounds pretty neato and fun. And lol yeaa if it's inexpensive it could be dangerous XD RIP wallet lol.
Marisa (Weeb): **h o m e w o r k c o m p l e t e**
Marisa (Weeb): the park has crows that are giant. japan's crows are giant. you're not allowed to feed them but they're huge. big boys.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Brother?! <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): lol
Marisa (Weeb): onii-chan
Marisa (Weeb): centaurs have four shoulders
Marisa (Weeb): elbows and knees are basically the same thing, but like... backwards.
Erik (slendergiant): Random question I've had for a while: Why are some spellings of anime characters' names different, specifically "o"/"ou" (e.g. Bakugo/Bakugou, Shota/Shouta, etc...)
Also, why are they never consistent with the order of first and last name? Like, when watching BNHA, they usually say *Katsuki Bakugo* (first/last) but they'll say *Kirishima Eijiro* (last/first). I think it's common for the last name to come first in Japanese, but I'm not sure? Someone educate me lol
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): <@301927856240459777> we call on your currently in japan knowledge
Marisa (Weeb): hewwo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was just about to @ Marisa too XD
Marisa (Weeb): oo. yeah last names come first. romanization is really wonky. the ou sound is really hard to distinguish when speaking, but it's necessary in the written form
Marisa (Weeb): so shouta and bakugou should technically have the ou because that how their names are read, but it's hard to hear the difference between bakugou and bakugo outloud. shouta i feel is a pretty big difference though anyone who calls him shota i'll fight
Marisa (Weeb): oh do you have an example of the name order consistancy?
Marisa (Weeb): usually it's always 100% last/first
Marisa (Weeb): wait bakugo is his first name
Marisa (Weeb): nvm
Marisa (Weeb): is it??
Marisa (Weeb): nvm
Erik (slendergiant): Bakugo is his last name
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I thought Bakugo was his last name... cause his mom has that in her name too soo X
Marisa (Weeb): yeah i'm going insane
Marisa (Weeb): if you have an example of the name thing from within the last few volumes i can open the japanese version here for comparison
Erik (slendergiant): And in the subs (and the wiki) their names are *Bakugo* and *Shota*
Marisa (Weeb): probably just looks nicer like that. 
I saw Tsukiji written as Tzukidi once on an official map romanization is weird
Marisa (Weeb): i'm gonna check the japanese volume let me dig one out
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *the truth holder, aka japanese mangas* lol
Marisa (Weeb): all names are written last to first for everything that has their full names except for the american characters from the movie
Erik (slendergiant): 
Marisa (Weeb): the japanese includes the-ou <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): oh in the subs that'd be localization
Marisa (Weeb): he probably says it the other way around i can check that too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think it mostly boils down to how things come over through translation. Things get a little wonky in the spelling and pronunciation. I mean look at how we spell things vs. Britain that are the same words XD
Marisa (Weeb): confirmed in the sub he says「担任の相澤消太だ] "tanin no aizawa shouta da"
official subs will localize names ye so that they're first name last name for the americans 🇺🇸
Erik (slendergiant): 
Marisa (Weeb): is that from the official manga or a fan scanlation?
Erik (slendergiant): might be fan scan xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It must just be like ou thing we have with Britain... XD
We *refuse* to put U's in stuff XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Random comment: OwO we watching old school Sweeney Todd in class apparently!?
Marisa (Weeb): fans like to keep stuff original because they just don't care. though i like the mushroom puns they did recently.
Marisa (Weeb): that's swee[ney]t[odd]
Marisa (Weeb): translations suck because there's usually no exact translation. like two people can point to a dog and just say "dog" in their respective languages but there's a ton of cultural and grammatical stuff u can't translate fghdjhkj,
Marisa (Weeb): here i go on a rant here we go my explanatory rant time feel free to ignore
Marisa (Weeb): my classmate told us a story the other day of when she went to a barbershop and got her hair cut, and the cashier asked "how was it?" afterwards, and she said "not bad! 😃 " [direct translation into japanese from english]. they were furious and kicked her out and refused her future service because they found it insulting.

meanwhile my students always ask "what's senpai/kouhai in english?" and i have to go explaining that we don't have that in english. call your boss by their first name if it's a small company. be equally chummy with the newbie and the guy that's been working there for ten years. they get absolutely shocked at hearing this and some can't even wrap their head around the concept because senpai/kouhai relationships are so ingrained in society.
Marisa (Weeb): also sandwiches here are called sands. sometimes they aren't even sandwiches they're cookies like oreos. enjoy eating your chocolate sand.
Marisa (Weeb): ~~this is why you never ask me for advice~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im never calling them sandwiches again
Jess (whoozica): oooo did they think she was saying "not bad" like "its pretty shitty but not bad"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im going to integrate this into my life and confuse everyone when i say i want a sand
Marisa (Weeb): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WOW
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i love this
Marisa (Weeb): she should have said "it was great! fantastic! wonderful! good!" but saying not bad kind of insinuated something was wrong with it
Marisa (Weeb): 'warukunai' kind of has a bad connotation. like "it wasn't bad *but*...."
Marisa (Weeb): omg i tried one of these before it was so tiny i felt lied to
chocolate sand ice
because ice cream can just be called ice
Marisa (Weeb): there was a really really good tumblr post that explained the problems with localizations ages ago but i can't find it now.
basically japanese is super vague and stuff can have a lot of meanings. the spoken language has much less phonemes than english does which means there are a ton of homonyms. japanese also doesn't use plurals, doesn't have different verb tenses for present and future, and words that are borrowed from english don't retain their original english meaning (like the word "claim" here means to complain about something, and consent means an electrical outlet).
there's also phrases with cultural significance that are used *so* often that just can't be conveyed in english. like "the moon is beautiful tonight" is usually a romantic confession of undying love that was coined by some famous author that all japanese kids read in high school. but ain't no american gonna understand that implication so they have to change it up and the translation becomes something more like "it's so beautiful i love it" to preserve the romantic undertones and vagueness while still being true to the source material
Marisa (Weeb): **i am very passionate about manga**
Marisa (Weeb): i could go on but i will spare y'all and go to bed instead. hmu if u wanna discuss linguistic roadblocks in anime localization.
Jess (whoozica): thats a good explaination 👌
Marisa (Weeb): OH WAIT BEFORE I GO
Marisa (Weeb): ~~THERE'S MORE~~
Marisa (Weeb): THIS PROBLEM ALSO EXISTS THE OTHER WAY AROUND
90% of stuff is lost in english --> japanese translation. the avengers movie this year was missing SO much in japanese and all of the jokes were basically cut out of the subs because there was just no way to say them in japanese. humor is totally different and sarcasm is basically non-existant. movies lose a lot of their humor and personality when they're localized for japanese audiences and just become pure action flicks.

BUT japanese localization will also give characters speaking ticks. Voltron for example. all of the humor in netflix voltron is pretty much lost. but Allura uses very regal language and speaks like a princess when talking to others, with very VERY formal and haughty and feminine language, while corran uses very subservient and polite language and keith just sounds like an edgelord. pidge also uses both masculine and feminine speech. she uses "wa" at the end of some sentences but refers to herself as "boku" which is masculine
