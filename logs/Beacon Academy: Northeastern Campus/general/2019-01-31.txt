Anna (loud and likely blonde): If it's a math class pay attention but. If not. Do homework
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Also I survived the trip back to my house it's cold as balls
Georgia (Something Sensible): nah it circuits
Georgia (Something Sensible): and im already taking E&M 2
Georgia (Something Sensible): and yes it is colder than balls
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I wish electrical engineering intro didn't kill my love for wiring cause like. That makes my current need to relearn circuits for cosplay annoying. Napping or homework sounds like a better use of your time than paying attention rn tho honestly 

~~i got a D+ thanks machtay you were a psycho prof~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My circuits professor was a genius but didn't know how to teach for shit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"Just set it up in a matrix and solve the equations simultaneously!"*
*Okay, but we haven't learned **how** to do that yet...*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Had to google "how to invert matrix on [insert calculator here]"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Then* it made some sort of sense
Anna (loud and likely blonde): My circuits guy was the one who banned watches and threw a kid out of the class for taking a photo of the board
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Didn't understand why we were worried before tests cause he 'was always prepared several days in advance'
Jamie (Jamie): Why do i love the walrus kigu so much
Jamie (Jamie): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): Goo goo ga choob
Marisa (Mawisa): im doodling myself as a furry and i blame the bad influence of this server
Mark (Mad Doctor): So I was thinking of a Scooby Doo cosplay and of course I would be Old Man Maguffin so of course I would need a yeti costume and then it dawned on me: are the villains in Scooby Doo all furries?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not all of them.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Some are scaleys.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMAO mark
Jamie (Jamie): I wonder how many cosplayers are losing at katsu crunch because of kh3
Evie (Katheryne Knight): A decent amount from what I'm seeing. XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Or are changing their cosplans because of KH3
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I've been seing that too. People are adding KH to their Katsu list last minute. KingKitsu is doing Monster Sora
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I've already got a lot on my hands I'm okay with what I'm doing XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Not sure what to think about this. The author of the article clearly takes sides, but the rumors have been around for a while. And the way reports keep emerging makes me inclined to believe them. On the other hand, Vic's response seems genuine. He clearly crossed several lines in his behavior, but I don't think he's a predator.  Some response is warranted, clearly. More than a slap on the wrist and less than life in prison. Finding the line shows how messy life can be

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I'm very disappointed in him. This stuff has been going around for years but I thought he might have cleaned his act.uo

all I gotta say is he needs yo release another apology OWNING UP TO HIS MISTAKES and showing he's willing to move forward and CHANGE. He's gonna lose jobs if he keeps this up. He's also being cancelled from multiple conventions because of this behavior . He needs to clean up or he's gonna get kicked. There's already a pention to try and replace him for Qrow.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He's gotta own up and change his behavior or leave the anime scene for good.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It sucks cause I love his work but my God he's a dick
Mark (Mad Doctor): Agreed. When I took Audrey to see him, he gave her a peck on the cheek. She was thrilled and I saw nothing untoward in the interaction, but in hindsight I can see how someone might react negatively to that. And that's on him. He has sworn to avoid contact at cons. I'll judge him by his actions.
And private chats with minors crosses a line. I set up a Discord for my nerd club on the condition that we have four adult advisors on it and private chats are disabled. And even then we had to get special permission.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yikes. ~~is anime news network known for defending him or? im missing the weight of that~~ 
like an italian/european kiss like the side of the cheek thing is one thing and like a hug with permission is one thing. but if youre the adult you gotta understand boundaries like that
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think Kelsey's implication is that ANN is a step above viral Facebook posts, since they have to conform to some journalistic norms.  And I agree with what you said. The adult figure of authority can't fall back on "hey, we grew up doing this, you shouldn't feel violated." If the last few years have shown anything, it's that the old ways don't always respect a person's boundaries and dignity
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ahh i see okay. 
but also because a kid will always feel more mature than they are and think 'this is fine this is awesome' in the moment but is it really. If it wasnt a famous person would you be okay in the same amount?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good point
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I got starbucks gold... I got the notification I had a month left to get the last 8 points so instead of making tea in the office I bought tea on the way into work.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I went cold turkey on the *good* drinks cause of the 40+ carb count but at least I have gold for the year.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I met Vic when i was maybe 14 and my mom went with me
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think all he did was give a hug and call a lot of the girls "honey" or "cutie"
Georgia (Something Sensible): i dont think hes a bad guy based on that encounter, maybe his popularity in anime got to his head or something
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I've had some pretty close friends have extremely bad interactions with him... back in like 2014-2015.
A friend and a bunch of her online friends got together for months and made Vic an artbook filled with fanart of all his characters and little letters to him and whatnot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they had it all printed out and binded like a read hard cover book
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and my friend was the one tasked to bring it to him at Anime boston
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she went up to him and expressed how much she liked him and explained the book
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he opening it and saw that some of the art depicted his characters in gay situations
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): told her that "she needs to find god"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and refused to look any more at the book
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im sorry WHAT
Georgia (Something Sensible): whoa
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and she came back to the hotel room SOBBING
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so we spent the rest of the weekend trying to cheer her up, and she was so worried about what she was going to tell her friends
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was a fucking mess
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~what the fuck~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i suddenly feel obligated to put his characters in gay situations tbh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hes extremely homophobic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~what EXACTLY was your favorite rwby ship again anna~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO TRUE BILL
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~ironqrow~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~what gay ship can i do for ed elric now~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wasn't terribly impressed with him when I saw him at CCE. I found him fake, eating up fan attention. All his question answers were like "I love my fans. I love each of you. You all matter so much to me" and I'm like 'this 14 year old you've never met, who swears you saved her life by voicing an anime character?'.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh yea i remember that
Anna (loud and likely blonde): on a better note. We got a loonie thrown at us by todd haberkorn at cce at a panel we stumbled into
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also feeding into qrow is rubys dad theories just to cause a stir
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): whats a loonie
Anna (loud and likely blonde): a canadian dollar coin
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~mag is canadian~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I still say he his but~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Elizabeth Maxwell is a peach tho.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Great woman.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): agreed
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but yeah haberkorn dodged literally every question about working with vic at cce it was great.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Shame in their coop panel Vic talked over her every chance he could get and all the questions were ~~lengthy stories about how Vic saved children's lives with the power of his voice?~~ aimed at Vic.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): he threw the loonie at mag cause he was like "i got a canadian....dollar.." and mag just ~~screamed~~ said loudly across the panel "ITS A LOONIE."
Anna (loud and likely blonde): poor elizabeth tho like
Anna (loud and likely blonde): thats just a sad thing to watch occur cause you cant stop it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Elizabeth had a solo panel. It was maybe 12 people?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tom Jess and I were in the front row.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She was on the opposite of the row.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I may have been joking about how I wouldn't recognize her if she was sitting next to me to Tom and Jess at the time~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh wow i met jessie pridemore
Georgia (Something Sensible): shes mentioned in the article
Georgia (Something Sensible): shes very very nice
Georgia (Something Sensible): she was at saikoucon when i did that cosplay competition
Georgia (Something Sensible): i didnt end up winning but where the other judges kinda blew me off, she offered a few improvements that could be made to my cosplay
Georgia (Something Sensible): in a friendly, approahable way
Jess (whoozica): yea i saw lots of complaints of him refusing to sign gay arts saying it was "non canon art" but then signing other art just fine
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that article. he told a jewish kid he could fix him being jewish
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and not catholic
Jess (whoozica): thats really sad, i feel bad for your friend. they put so much work and money into that and to be rejected is just... wow
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~fuck this im glad i didnt get his autograph at ANYC~~
Jess (whoozica): he could "fix" him? like convert? or?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Probably. I doubt the poor kid asked.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): it said vic asked why he brought fan music cd's to sign and not a christian music cd
Anna (loud and likely blonde): n the kid said 'cause im jewish'
Jess (whoozica): WHAT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....uhhhhhhhh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what
Jess (whoozica): does he sing in a christian band? like i dont eeven undestand
Jess (whoozica): "yes im going to meet this VA let me get out my hillsong cd, screw the rwby soundtrack"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Didn't you know the theme of CCE is good christian sensibilities?*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): * *pushes kalahari cup behind me* * sure
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Changes countdown timer from Swim and Drink Con* Yup.
Jess (whoozica): communion is traditionally taken with alcohol right?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Christian Communion Expo
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Jess hacked church*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk what religion but catholic is u either take the wine or the bread
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Both.
Jess (whoozica): i always had both but alot of church gave u grape juice instead
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye, it was grape juice most of my times at church.
Jess (whoozica): i think my grandmas church has wine for adults and grape juice for kids
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~not confirming your grandma's church's things. Just that I've seen that~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): hmmm they never gave us both at once and the wine was always crappy wine watered down
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Catholic you can take either or. Depends on the parish. Some offer both forms while others only offer bread
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm UCC soooo we have the grape juice and yummy thicc bread
Mark (Mad Doctor): My church now offers gluten free Body of Christ. Wine is standard, even for kids. Never take it myself. I see that chalice as a holy petri dish
Jess (whoozica): yeaaaaa most churches ive been to do the little cups
Jess (whoozica): ~~the communal communion cups always me me a little uncomfortable~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We got the smol cups but intinction is an option if you want to
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *shit* this song that came on radio had a series of door knocks as the opening and since I have noise cancelling headphones I was like 'whose banging on my door/21st floor window'.
Jess (whoozica): ooo that like when im driving and a song has wee-woos in it and i have aheart attack cuz i think im getting pulled over
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Same Energy.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee same Jess XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YES SAME JESS
Jess (whoozica): ive taken years off my life
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's a mood
Anna (loud and likely blonde): on that note do yall freak out when u hear the same pitch thats the start of a fire alarm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Not after college~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was desensitized.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~college made me that way~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): every muscle in my body tenses
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But it was never *actually* a fire, just some drunk asshat with popcorn in a microwave.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): one sec
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *i beg to differ*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh shit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Glad your fire department doesn't *wait 15 minutes to show up because they **also** assume false alarm*.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh we thought it was popcorn bc our office is like. right outside the frame on the right in that building
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Holy shiiittt
Anna (loud and likely blonde): our office is locted in the building like. right where the front of the fire engine is covering
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~yes it was a dorm fire~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): funny story. we couldnt go back in the dorms for two weeks for some and two months after that not because they had to clean, but because the fire dept broke every door and they had to replace them
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i think. it was. like 2 million dollars in damage + cleanup effort cause they had to strip every inch of carpet out too and each door was like $300-$500
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and this is why i am afraid of fire alarms
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My senior year we had a fire drill nearly every week. The dorm we were in was new and they rushed to finish it. Smoke detectors were placed right above the kitchen counter areas where people qere likely to do cooking. Probably weren't calibrated properly. Also took fire dept like 20 minutes to get there even though they're right down the street.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): theres like a 100% chance youre right cause same thing with one of our campus' buildings.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): One of the RAs put this up :joy:
Anna (loud and likely blonde): someone later remind me to list some of my wigs for sale
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im never gonna wear like 5 of these
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Hey list some of your wigs for sale
Anna (loud and likely blonde): >->
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Good news, my office is still really hot during the afternoons.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So my future brother-in-law's dad is planning an outing for him and some of the guys in the family while the ladies have a bridal shower, and they invited me to go too. At first I was like, *eh* because it's at a golfing place. I thought it was like, a high class golf course which I'd honestly find incredibly dull especially since I don't golf.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But it's at a *high-tech driving range* type place and actually looks fucking dope as hell
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://topgolf.com/us/play/games/
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~scout for cosplay locations~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ah ye, my sister's boyfriend golfs and goes to those.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's like golfing without the walking.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://cdn.topgolf.com/assets/galleries/85505/11655_bar-restaurant-topgolf-mt-laurel.jpg
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 😍
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I know I'll suck, but this still looks super cool
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://cdn.topgolf.com/assets/galleries/85505/11680_targets-topgolf-mt-laurel.jpg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh yea I've seen those places sometimes when driving. They look pretty cool ~~even though I could give a rats ass about golf lol.~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think they also have places like that that are similar for like baseball and such?
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Oh Matt's been to that place before. I was invited to go but I had work so I can't tell you how it is from personal experience. But I live fairly close to it. It's right near my school.
