Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Blessed things: fleece pull over, jeans, showers with water pressure. 
Cursed things: the fourth day of the 40 day flood, forgetting my umbrella and a hat, being awake right now.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Going through my group memberships to hide “does anyone have pictures of my naruto cosplay” posts. It’s the event that started it all.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The fog is back owo
Tom (tomukuncosplay): owo
Erik (slendergiant): So I usually take a pre-work nap after I shower, eat breakfast, and make my lunch and I had turned my alarm off because of Friday so guess who fucking woke back up at 8:00
Erik (slendergiant): Was only 15 minutes late for work
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Not too bad
Tom (tomukuncosplay): But yeah my alarm is off too 👌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was going to try for the earlier train. I pushed my alarm back an hour when I woke up and went back to bed, then snoozed once.
Erik (slendergiant): Also, really fucking glad for this weekend because the others who are working on this big RFQ we need to get done ended up coming in Saturday to work on it
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): I somehow left at 8 and got to work at 8:50 because traffic was THAT bad
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): back to school traffic kid.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): September hits and traffic multiples by a factor of too much.
Erik (slendergiant): alrighty, guess I should start doing actual work...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): nope.
Jess (whoozica): work is hard
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im trying to convince myself to do work so i can go home early, but im so sick that i cant concentrate lmaooooooooooo fuckkkkkkk
Erik (slendergiant): so my boss did the BOM I had been working on on Thursday and he created internal part numbers that I already created and he did them wrong... -_-
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RIP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I tried to call in a work from home and I got turned down.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *he has until that 5 hour energy I took leaving this morning wears off and then I die*
Jess (whoozica): im seriously incoherent at work this morning
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): SAME and I'm supposed to be planning the rest of the year's workload!
Jess (whoozica): i just mixed up 5 and 7
Jess (whoozica): OOF
Jess (whoozica): workload: none
Marisa (Weeb): if you start breathing really quickly and shortly it'll give you an adrenaline boost but also you might pass out and if that doesn't happen you'll have an adrenaline crash very soon 👍
Jess (whoozica): WHOA knowledge
Erik (slendergiant): Today's lunch brought to you in part by B-Lux Grill and Bar
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Today’s lunch from the pizza place immediately next door be cause it wet and I lack rain gear.
Jess (whoozica): ~~todays lunch brought to you by questionable leftovers found in my fridge this morning~~

Erik (slendergiant): and then another container with just onion rings
Erik (slendergiant): so many onion rings

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh did he? Neat.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The five hour energy has worn off. There is nothing left.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh my god I saw XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hunter the good boi™
Erik (slendergiant): Question: Do I start an argument on Twitter with someone who thinks Tai is an ass and is still in love with Raven?
Erik (slendergiant): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I assume you already replied and are asking facetiously~~
Erik (slendergiant): I haven't hit the reply button... yet...
Erik (slendergiant): I also don't want to spam Dishwasher's post with an argument lol
Erik (slendergiant): I think I'm going to reply with *just* the photo
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): much memier.
Erik (slendergiant): or maybe I'll caption it with "Raven, the love of my life. You have returned to me."
Mark (Mad Doctor): "...to ask for beer money."
Erik (slendergiant): 
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 👌 👌 👌 👌
