meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Alrighty then
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There are weirder things he could be complimenting
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): This is true 👆🏻
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I didn’t know nose fetishes we’re a thing, tho who am I to judge
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And honestly it's kind of a good compliment because I feel facial features are something people can be more self conscious about and some people honestly hate their noses so... 🤷
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I do hate my nose, but I appreciate that he likes my contour skills
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also because I've seen some pretty good noses and for whatever reason I'm like,  *"wow, what a nice nose"*
