Mark (Mad Doctor): Just a warning: the next round of tarriffs is likely to add 25% to the price of shoes and clothes imported from China. If you have plans to order cosplays, sooner might be better than later

Georgia (Something Sensible): which is kinda dumb because the american dollar is the strongest currency
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: lol US Tariff policy under trump has been crap
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the whole trade war with china is a mess
Mark (Mad Doctor): Trump sees trade as a zero sum game of winners and losers. He is a mercantilist in how he regards the balance of trade, which kind of became uncool with Adam Smith 250 years ago
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh its the thing they talk about in ferris bueller!
Georgia (Something Sensible): protective tariffs became uncool when we got a depression lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Is your knowledge coming from ferris bueller's day off
