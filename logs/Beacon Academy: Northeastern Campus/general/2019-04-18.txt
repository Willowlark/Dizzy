Georgia (Something Sensible): The school D&D groups like to meet in the student center at nights
Georgia (Something Sensible): So Iâ€™m getting food for dinner and  I see the groups with their books and papers
Georgia (Something Sensible): I gotta say, D&D has got to be the most inclusive thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): I see all races, genders, styles, and majors playing together
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *finding a consistent group of players is a bitch so*
Mark (Mad Doctor): A far cry from when I first started playing. It used to be a bastion of straight white virgin boys. My group was unusual in that two girls were part of our core. Glad to see it's changing. My student groups are a lot more like what you describe
Anna (blonde and sad): bruh i just re-found my old roommate on tumblr/instagram and her art is just as beautiful as i remember

Jamie (Jamie): This store always tempting me way to much and these are actually pretty cute ~~but Holy crow 85 bucks~~
Anna (blonde and sad): OOOF that's a lot.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: nah its not that specific
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: different stores use the pumps for different stuff
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: like our black pumps are on our foam syrups
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: (cascara, cinnamon lemon, and 1 vanilla)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the only real essential difference between pumps is the half pump and the full pump
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Rip. I worry the NYC store doesn't hear me right when I say sugar free so I wanted to like, watch the pump to be sure.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The music is wAAAYYY too loud in that store.
