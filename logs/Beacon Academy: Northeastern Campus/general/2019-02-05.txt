Erik (Red Riot Thot): MM doesn't want me to play again because it's not letting me open up any the chat :(
Jess (whoozica): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Mawisa): Did you start a new game already?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I figured out what was wrong
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I never did the first one üòë
Marisa (Mawisa): First what?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The first chat after the beginning chat
Marisa (Mawisa): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So i'm now 3 chats behind
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Might as well start over again
Marisa (Mawisa): Start at midnight!
Marisa (Mawisa): If you start now you‚Äôd miss those chats again
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh true
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): How considerate
Georgia (Something Sensible): THE ROOMIES GOT BOYF APPROVAL
Georgia (Something Sensible): GEORGIA DOESNT HAVE GARBO ROOMIES NEXT YEAR HUZZAH
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YAYAYAYAYAY
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wooo!!!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~and he didn't have to pull his hunger game stunts on them.~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Understandable
ZombieHunter: https://roosterteeth.com/post/51982081
ZombieHunter: Vic fired from RT >.>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wow happened sooner than expected
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I'm proud of RT for this

But Qrow is my fav character so I'm concerned he's gonna get written off like Glynda
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Hire <@!276514872286773258> as Qrow
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YES THATS WHAY IVE BEEN SAYING
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hire my bf plz
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Let üëè Chris üëè be üëè Qrow üëè
Matt (mattmyers25): The problem is I see is how will they treat his character
ZombieHunter: IMO
ZombieHunter: If their opinion and stance is strong
ZombieHunter: Qrow will stay. But they will replace Vic to remind him he‚Äôs not irreplaceable
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I‚Äôm assuming this means Qrow is dying very early on in the next season
ZombieHunter: Not necessarily.
ZombieHunter: Consider Monty died and neath took that spot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea idk if they will kill him off early because of this
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Bit of a different situation though
ZombieHunter: Qrow is an important character. Enough that he was originally to be voiced by Monty before he died.
ZombieHunter: I doubt they‚Äôll kill him off
Matt (mattmyers25): This is true. I just dont want qrow to be written out like glynda was
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Yee
ZombieHunter: He‚Äôs too important. Glynda wasn‚Äôt significant enough
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But I do feel Qrow is too important to br killed off *yet*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Glynda was not important though theres a difference there
ZombieHunter: Qrow has bigger standing
Matt (mattmyers25): This is true
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): She wasnt a main character
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ye Glynda was just... threre
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wish she had been more. She was a fun character
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea she had a cool design too but oh well
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that's my fear but I also know RT will find a good replacement 

If not Chris, D.C Douglas
Matt (mattmyers25): It will be interesting to see where the series goes from here. I'm just worried since I'm cosplaying qrow at katsu, I might get flack for cosplaying him
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Nahh I don't think you will. It's the VA, not the chara
Evie (Katheryne Knight): NOOOOOOOOOOOOPE the character isn't the VA
Matt (mattmyers25): Get troy Baker or the guy who voices Tom from toonami to voice qrow
Chris (GeneralOnyx): Eyyyy
Im never active and im sorry but would it be okay if I asked ya'll to give this post some love? 

Im gonna actually try giving this a full shot even though theres no chance xD


Check out @GeneralOnyx‚Äôs Tweet: https://twitter.com/GeneralOnyx/status/1092602606051037184?s=09
Evie (Katheryne Knight): don't throw away your shot 

Don't be a Burr, sir.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): As we learned from me with arryn IT NEVER HURTS TO TRY
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^^^^^
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üëÜüèªüëÜüèª
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Retweeted, signal BOOST
Chris (GeneralOnyx): Ya'll are the best

Someone yell at me to be active here more
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Now be more active here man üòÇ
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): BOOOOOST
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Honestly, that would be kind of a neat thing if they opened up auditions for prospective voice actors/actresses in the community rather than looking for an expensive professional
Chris (GeneralOnyx): ^^
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm it would be. Give people trying to come up into the career a chance
Chris (GeneralOnyx): Im convinced they already have someone in mind
Georgia (Something Sensible): what makes you think that?
Chris (GeneralOnyx): Idk
Usually a production company rhat large has backups berore they make those calls

Especially if they are confident it wont cause issues
Erik (Red Riot Thot): True, but I also feel that in light of recent events, they may have wanted to cut those ties asap before it became more of a scandal. They have plenty of time before they get to recording lines, plus it's animated so he can still be in the scene without actually speaking
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Don't let your dreams be dreams
Rebecca (madameterralupus): https://giphy.com/gifs/ACcXRXwUqJ6Ok
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You've got this hunny üíìüíìüíì
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fun fact, when I was 9, I heard a rumor that Dan Radcliffe wasn't going to be continuing doing Harry Potter after Chamber of Secrets, so I contacting Scholastic (because that's where you could send fanmail to J.K. Rowling) and they replied saying that they're not involved with the movies, but they gave me the contact info for Warner Bros, soooo... doesn't hurt to at least try my dude

Marisa (Mawisa): google why does my stomach hurt when I‚Äôve been eating a balanced diet of chocolate and fruit roll ups all day
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That doesn't sound like a good tasting combination lol

Marisa (Mawisa): Sometimes I do the tongue tattoos
