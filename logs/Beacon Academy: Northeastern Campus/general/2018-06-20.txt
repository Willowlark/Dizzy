Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~I’ll see myself to the trashcan~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RT: You want what? Oh, ____ right, awesome!
RT: *erases ____ from list of things to put in RWBY*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): How dare
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They gave me tease in RWBY Chibi and Renora became canon in the following season after RC season one aired sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): just give me interaction RT 
Maybe a somber moment between them
Or even THEM FIGTING BACK TO BACK AND PUTTING THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE FOR THE GREATER GOOD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~Okay I’m off to the garbage bin bye~~
Jess (whoozica): ill just watch my faves fade further and further into the background, i got my moment. ~~but like maybee a kiss plz~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I recommend going to Fanfiction land.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it's a lot better.
snow ( crescentbladed ): ~~is renora canon??~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): **but it's not canon if it's fanfiction
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!351471675843411978> yeaaah basically me

Eeeeehhhh I haven’t read fan fiction in a while. Too many don’t do a good job of really keeping the characters in character.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!266718984571846656> it basically became canon at the end of Season 4
snow ( crescentbladed ): _good_
Jess (whoozica): dat sweet hand touch
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tvtropes has a fanfic recommendation page fro Rwby. 90% of that list is good, in so far as quality and characterization. You personally may not like every fic rec'd, but it's all top tier quality.
Erik (slendergiant): http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/218/928/e14.gif
Mark (Mad Doctor): Given that Volume Six is aiming for Atlas storylines, there's a lit on the plate including: Winter/Qrow, Ilia's vengeance, goodbye to Penny (or hello again), Weiss vs. Whitley/Jacques, Team RWBY learning to be a team again,  Rosegarden tension (or not) plus the Great Lame McGuffin of the artifacts.  I'd be happy if RT did two of them well.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Two is a lofty goal.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm an optimist
Jess (whoozica): *talks about renora for .2 seconds*
*motivation for swimsuit nora shoots through the roof*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): casually drops this in here >.>

Marisa (Weeb): O there are animated gifs of that tangled AU on tumblr it’s pretty well done
