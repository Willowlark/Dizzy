Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s dat boi
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!301927856240459777> what were you saying?
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah I mean you’d think someone who questioned the existence of giraffes would like. Go to a zoo and try to see one? You know? They have a giraffe in just about every zoo so you could just go and try to determine yourself if it was a weird dog with a big neck brace. But he refused and just insisted that they weren’t real until one day in a museum gift shop he went *haywire* and tore up all the giraffe dolls and books like a frenzied fanboy who just heard his waifu sucks. 
He had to pay for all the stuff but it looked pretty neat all chewed and torn up in a big pile like a birds nest. Maybe he was the strange dog projecting his insecurities onto the giraffes, idk I haven’t seen him since.
Marisa (Weeb): But remember when he dropped a bagel into the river lol
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Yeah...

Marisa (Weeb): if spiders had glasses would they be tiny versions of human glasses or would they have 8+ lenses
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): probably a bunch of lenses
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): if they had glasses we'd all be terrified.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): correct
Marisa (Weeb): what if they were just for Aesthetic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so what youre describing is ... a hipster spider...a hipspider
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats horrifying
Marisa (Weeb): what about flies. fly glasses.
Marisa (Weeb): if they existed you could unironically say the phrase "hey those are some pretty fly glasses" on a regular basis
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): good point. lets make this a reality.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oooh, lightroom got new updates.
Marisa (Weeb): GoFundMe or Kickstarter
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): both?

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): dear lord <@143910209738244096> I haven't seen super smash flash since I had flash drive full of games to play on the high school computers.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Very vintage.
Emerling: The updated version is wayyyy smoother now 😛
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think I had 2 as well...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd have to check the hard drive I store my excess files on.
Emerling: 8/10 would recommend for keeping your hands busy while watching animoo
Erik (slendergiant): when you think a famous person follows you on Insta but it turns out to be a fake account
Erik (slendergiant): but the fake account links to the real person's Patreon?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa that happens. Sucks when it does. I don't get why people make these "fake accounts" .-.
Erik (slendergiant): Like I got really excited, but was really confused as to why they only had 15 followers...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww 😦
snow ( crescentbladed ): that happened to me with dr phil
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Dr. Phil?! XDD WHAT
Erik (slendergiant): Side-by-side
snow ( crescentbladed ): LISTEN I THOUGHT HE WANTED TO FOLLOW ME
snow ( crescentbladed ): fake news
Jess (whoozica): Dayum
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wow gotta love these accounts that literally copy and artist word for word and shit... like what?? Just follow their work, no need to coy their stuff and try to be them .-.
And lol awww
snow ( crescentbladed ): I think fan accounts are ok but like make it obviously a fan account
Erik (slendergiant): *I'm going to make a fake account and steal their work verbatim but promote their Patreon at no benefit to me. That'll show how big a fan I am!*
snow ( crescentbladed ): LOGIC
Erik (slendergiant): I sent a message to the real account and reported the fake
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol right? XD Like what... and that's good. 😃
Erik (slendergiant): I prefaced the message with *"I don't know if you'll actually ever read this, but..."*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Aww
Erik (slendergiant): 😂
snow ( crescentbladed ): Relatable
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Almost every phone call I have gotten today is from the one big company my mom's office does a lot of work with, and they are looking for her. Of course then when I say she's out of town at a conference in NY they are like oh wait right, she's jsut up the road from us then... never mind maybe we'll just run into her today or tomorrow then 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): To the fake account conversation:
