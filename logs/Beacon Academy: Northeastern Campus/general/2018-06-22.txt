Erik (slendergiant): So how much thought do I have to put into something to nullify it as an impulse purchase? 😂
Jess (whoozica): oh boy
Erik (slendergiant): I haven't bought anything...
Erik (slendergiant): ...yet
Jess (whoozica): what you buying this time 👀
Erik (slendergiant): Still thinking about the Switch
Mark (Mad Doctor): "I still want that just as badly as I did five minutes ago." Sounds like a legitimate amount of self-reflection
Erik (slendergiant): But my reasoning is that it would be good to have for RTX for both airport/plane ride and waiting in lines
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it's been nice for my train commute.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): only has about 4 hour battery life though, iirc.
Jess (whoozica): i mean if youve been thinking about it for at least a week then id say its not an impulse buy
Erik (slendergiant): However...
Erik (slendergiant): These bad boys just came out
Erik (slendergiant): https://store.roosterteeth.com/products/rwby-mens-board-shorts?variant=7900185657392
Jess (whoozica): <@!351785752197201920>
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah was looking at em already 🙏 🙏
Jess (whoozica): ~~century link sucks so bad i cant open the link~~
Jess (whoozica): wait, do they come small enough for you tom?
Erik (slendergiant): Although I really don't need another bathing suit... I already have to buy 2 new ones for CCE 😅
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oh didn't look lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Jess (whoozica): never enough bathing suits
Erik (slendergiant): https://store.roosterteeth.com/products/rwby-slide-sandals?variant=7902439702576
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): INTENSIFIES
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://store.roosterteeth.com/products/rwby-beach-towel
Erik (slendergiant): I think they're coming out with a new towel though
Jess (whoozica): YOOO I WANT THE TOWEL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ARE THEY? today?
Erik (slendergiant): maybe? the towel in my screenshot looks different
Jess (whoozica): tom and i dont have alot of towels this completely justifies this purchase
Georgia (Something Sensible): Where the heckie is the bikini tho
Erik (slendergiant): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): those are the swimsuits arent they?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WELP either way
Jamie (Jamie): Ahhh i finally get to play Grimm eclipse 😍
Erik (slendergiant): oh shit maybe they are?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > RT releases RWBY Bikinis
> They're just Mojojoj's designs
> Mojojoj rakes in all the cash
> every one is happy except RT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *kinda wantsthe RWBY swim trunks even though they are for men, cause women's swim bottoms suck*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same
Erik (slendergiant): ok so yeah that is the towel
Erik (slendergiant): I spent the last hour or so going through RT podcasts because I remembered Barbara mentioning towels and then I checked the store and now they're listed under the new merch xD
Erik (slendergiant): but anyway, just bought the RWBY and the RT ones xD
Georgia (Something Sensible): impulse counter?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ deff
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also damn I was gonna buying the RWBY swim trunks but guy sizing is conffuussssiinnnggg 😫
Erik (slendergiant): it's actually super easy. measure your waist and that's it
Erik (slendergiant): and it's like, usually standardized unlike women's sizing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I did and I got the biggest size which I know that ain't right. Lmfao. Cause a mans 36 waist pants are too big on me last I checked.
So gonna redo it when home xD
Dizzy: The erik-impulse-buys count is now 2!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): !counter erik-impulse-buys add 1
Erik (slendergiant): it might be few inches off because I normally wear a 32 and when I measured myself for my Darling uniform I was like, 35ish
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (We're only having fun with you Erik, not trying to be mean btw.)
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Imma solve it by trying on a pair of my dads pants and go from there lmfao xD
Erik (slendergiant): (I know, I'm laughing really hard about it 😂 )
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Speaking of impulse buying, steam sale started yesterday right?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *you can get a steam link for 2.50 what the fuckkkkk*
snow ( crescentbladed ): Do it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~time to buy half a dozen games I’ll never play~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Already have one.

Jess (whoozica): yea its really cool! you can play games from your computer on your tv
snow ( crescentbladed ): It’s really fun
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): is yours setup wireless Jess?
Jess (whoozica): i believe so
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We have too much interference in the house for wireless to work well, which sucks.
snow ( crescentbladed ): Same, wireless makes the FPS go to shit where I live
Jess (whoozica): tom amnages to play fighting games on it somehow
Erik (slendergiant): ah ok. I would have no use for that
Erik (slendergiant): but that's a ridiculously good price for it though
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and if you buy it *now*, that's an impulse buy.
Erik (slendergiant): oh but I am absolutely buying G-Mod
Jess (whoozica): I really like those rwby towels 🤔
Erik (slendergiant): yo the website version of Steam sucks...
Erik (slendergiant): I'm just browsing through games and I click for the next page and it's like "No results"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it doesn't usually. Lotta traffic today.
Erik (slendergiant): that's probably why
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): everyone squad up.
Jess (whoozica): #squadgoals

Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oi feel like we should get another one lmao , only 2.50 like damn
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Then you can play fighting games in the office, the living room, AND the bedroom~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Wooooo
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/ For anyone looking for steam games, I HIGHLY recommend Va11hallA. Fantastic music, great dialog, and it's not really long. They meme it as waifu bartending, but it's about all the quirky characters and glancing into their lives.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Still 50 bucks though.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also on my impulse buy list, a dry bag for 10 bucks that's like, 100% water proof and a water proof phonecase. I'll give you two guesses what both are for, it starts with C and ends with East.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): good idea
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): phone case anyway. The dry bag is kinda over kill.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But 10 bucks for something that could theoretically keep my camera dry if it god forbid ended up in water?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sold.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): BFULL Waterproof Dry Bag 5L/10L/20L/30L/40L [Lightweight Compact] Roll Top Water Proof Backpack with 2 Exterior Zip Pocket for Kayaking, Boating, Duffle, Camping, Floating, Rafting, Fishing (Black)

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh my mom has that dry bag for kayaking, its great
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yee, I figure it also makes a good just travel bag.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Amazon prime was a bad idea for me~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Shipping costs were really good at keeping me from buying stuff, cause I usually like little things where the shipping would be higher than the actual item.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh same, amazon prime is my downfall
