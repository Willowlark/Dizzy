Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~that's not even improv, I've done that rant a dozen times~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ok, so as some of you know, I'm the archivist for my school, which has been around for over 250 years.  Today, I stumbled across proposed artwork to be painted on the walls of the Kindergarten and 1st grade in 1959. It helps explain who Boomers are so fucked up.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's horrify xD
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): "Laugh with me" said the *demonic clown*

Right?! Like I want the bling boxes but know I'll just get team rwby again... don't get me wrong I love them but I want some of the other charas in the box ._.
Matt (mattmyers25): Jaune could get the hoodie if he ate pumpkin Pete's cereal
Marisa (Weeb): is there a blind box trading community? like on twitter perhaps?
blind boxes are big in japan and like 75% of bnha merchandise is all blind, so there's a huge swap culture for it. from people standing outside and trading them like cards to restaurants where you place them face-up at the edge of your table so people walking by can see what you want to trade away
Marisa (Weeb): the restaurants aren't for trading, you can get blind boxes and random anime coasters at the restaurants
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hell. How many blind boxes am I going to have to buy to get a Qrow?
Marisa (Weeb): at least one. maybe more.
Marisa (Weeb): maybe.
Mark (Mad Doctor): The odds are 1/24, which means I will have to buy 173
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~buy a whole case and theres usually one in there~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof don't tempt me Leanna xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I may do that just to get the Branwens >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~at least wait for a sale~~
Marisa (Weeb): [puts branwens on a pedestal on top of a red velvet cushion]
