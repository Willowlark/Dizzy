Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've been meaning to dust my room and wash my bed but instead I decided to organize my costume closet this week that no one but me sees XD
Marisa (Weeb): important. that is a big priority. the costumes require heightened attention.
Marisa (Weeb): i'm going to mt fuji this weekend even though it's supposed to rain all weekend and i figured "it'd be nice to return to an apartment that doesn't have piles everywhere." but there are many piles. the cosplay pile. the manga book pile. the manga magazine pile. the other anime-related book piles.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh sounds fun!! Hopefully the rain holds off for ya. And lol big mood. I have the same thing. Clothes, plushies, dishes, and shit to get rid of XD
Marisa (Weeb): thank! most of the mountain is closed because it's danger season but at least i can get out of the city for once and go somewhere new. ; u ;
Marisa (Weeb): PLUSHIE PILE PLUSHIE PILE
Marisa (Weeb): if the pile reaches a certain mass it attains consciousness
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh closed cause danger season?? Whaaa?
And lol thankfully I got most piles dealt with this weekend. Just gotta handle the now smaller plushie pile of 2 alpacas I keep putting in my dogs bed cause idk where to put them... which he is not happy about them being there XD
Marisa (Weeb): ***alpaca pile***

Marisa (Weeb): that was supposed to say alpaca
Marisa (Weeb): i guess it does in flags. huh.
Marisa (Weeb): Mt Fuji closes in september because it gets too cold at the top. techincally people can still go up, i don't think anyone can stop someone from climbing a giant mountain, but all the huts are closed and i think they turn off the mountain's wifi <:rip:378273525804433408>
Marisa (Weeb): winter agitates the volcanic activity or somethin
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh makes sense lol. and xD alpaca flagsss

Marisa (Weeb): BUT the clay had hardened through the day (***because that is what clay DOES***) and like. he couldn't get it off his foot so he's just stuck with these partially melted furry clay feet. rin had a chisel from an old fossel set and started chipping away at it but it takes HOURS to get that stuff off. long story short, terracotta clay stains your skin for multiple weeks and some say that those furry clay feet gave him a permanent tan.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hi Casey.
