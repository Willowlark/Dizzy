Marisa (Weeb): [twilight zone music plays]
Georgia (Something Sensible): i like seeing friends connect their spotify to discord because im actually genuinely curious what everyone is listening to right now
Georgia (Something Sensible): but i think sometimes spotify can just give the wrong message
Georgia (Something Sensible): cause mine just have " wezrez is listening to NSFW (.)(.)"
Georgia (Something Sensible): which, without content, looks bad
Jess (whoozica): Lmao I was just gonna send a screenshot 😂
Marisa (Weeb): *georgia stop listening to filth*
Marisa (Weeb): Where does it say what you’re listening to? I only ever see “Spotify”
Georgia (Something Sensible): its a song warning against taking nudes its actually really good LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): if you hover over my name i believe
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Marisa (Weeb): Ooooo yeah I clicked and it showed it. Banned.
Marisa (Weeb): It even tells you how far into the song that’s a little spooky
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah but also cool!
Georgia (Something Sensible): tl;dr i lowkey look at what yall are listening to if you have spotify connected to discord, but dont judge me for the interesting song titles i listen to lol
Jess (whoozica): Stalk your friends! Find out which ones listen to the same 10 songs in repeat (hint: it me)
Georgia (Something Sensible): ME AS FUCK TOO
Georgia (Something Sensible): tho i also realize its kinda funny, it works on mobile too i believe
Jess (whoozica): Ye!
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah can confirm mobile
Georgia (Something Sensible): so most of you can prob tell if im studying (classical) or working out or just chillin
Georgia (Something Sensible): hello friends i make it easy to stalk me
Marisa (Weeb): Is Spotify any good is there weeb music on there
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I do the same Georgia! I like seeing what music y'all enjoy. And sometimes I'll look what y'all are listening to up and I dig it to~ so gives me new stuff to listen to 🤗
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): 4 u marisa
Jess (whoozica): Lmao
Marisa (Weeb): NICE
Marisa (Weeb): I hope that’s discotheque
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~stalk me on discord, see how many times i listen to POP/STARS~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Funny thing about Spotify and the accounts I have it linked to is one day I wanted to listen to old school Disney stuff while cleaning... and now on Bumble it says one of my top artists is Hannah Montana 😂😂
Jess (whoozica): OH NO
Georgia (Something Sensible): g o o d
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's like all rock and then randomly... Hannah Montana 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like da fuq.. I listened to maybe 1 or 2 of her songs? 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): no, bumble knows, its your new favorite band now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My all time favorite singer. We Stan Hannah Montana. Don't swipe right if you don't either 😂 <-- new bio lmao
Halim (Greg): Wait
Halim (Greg): Is Hannah Montana not rock?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol good question.. what even *is* her genre? XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): i was just about to ask the same thing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd say pop? Like teeny pop
Halim (Greg): Its pop
Georgia (Something Sensible): where is the line between hannah montana and miley cyrus tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): TRU
Halim (Greg): Side note
Halim (Greg): What the fuck is pop
Halim (Greg): Like as a genre
Rebecca (madameterralupus): True.. it's kinda all over lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think pop has a distinct emphasis on vocals
Halim (Greg): Like pop is the genre where things we dont know where to put goes
Halim (Greg): Unless its folk or indie
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like my one local radio station is a "pop" station but yet they play rock and country sometimes too??
Jess (whoozica): I stopped trying to name what genres I like a long time ago and just differentiate between "I like" and "I don't like"
Georgia (Something Sensible): im sitting near at least 4 musicians let me ask them lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just tell "Ayo! What is pop?!"
Georgia (Something Sensible): "it has a synthetic element, and its popular, thats why theres stuff like pop punk and pop rock"
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats the answer i got
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ah 🤔
Halim (Greg): See heres the thing
Halim (Greg): People call stuff pop
Georgia (Something Sensible): they also agree that the vocals take a forefront
Halim (Greg): With out the modifier
Jess (whoozica): I feel like pop is such a vague discription
Georgia (Something Sensible): "pop is less artistic expression, less deviation from the norm, MADE 4 MONEY"
Halim (Greg): ~~my point is here people use pop to define pop which shows that it fails as a whole as a genre ~~
Halim (Greg): I dont think pop is in an of itself a fully distinguished genre 
I think it's more like a modifier for other genres
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel like its both
Georgia (Something Sensible): i get the "vocals focused, generally agreeable and cookie cutter" kinda idea
Georgia (Something Sensible): also its usually focused around singular artists rather than bands
Georgia (Something Sensible): _usually_
Halim (Greg): See but 'generally agreeable and cookie cutter' isnt a defining feature of the musical style though
Halim (Greg): That's why 90z pop is different from 2010s pop
Halim (Greg): Where as rock from the 90s and rock from 2010 both are very clearly rock
Halim (Greg): Focusing on vocals is a one good indicator but is it enough to consider it's own genre?
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah but the tune is more simplistic
Georgia (Something Sensible): like "hit me with your best shot" is a prime example
Georgia (Something Sensible): simple riff, focus on vocalist, and not made from passion but mores to be a hit, and essentially meant to be a "catchy hit"
Halim (Greg): Throwback to the fact that song is 80s music
Halim (Greg): Not as a counter point but as a like damn
Halim (Greg): That song is old
Georgia (Something Sensible): still that good shit tho, to just jam lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof sorry I’ve been dead on this chat. Henlo frens
Marisa (Weeb): h-hewwo? OwO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ÕwÒ
Marisa (Weeb): has anyone ever eaten a grapple
Erik (Red Riot Thot): a what?
Marisa (Weeb): 
Marisa (Weeb): an apple in every aspect but it tastes and smells like a grape. i've seen one it does smell like a grape.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): wha tis this witchcraft
Marisa (Weeb): froot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```Grāpple (/ˈɡreɪpəl/ GRAP-əl)[1][2] is the registered brand name for a commercially marketed brand of Fuji or Gala apple that has been soaked in a solution of food-grade concentrated grape flavor (methyl anthranilate) and water in an attempt to make the flesh taste like a Concord grape.```
Marisa (Weeb): the flesh
Erik (Red Riot Thot): /giphy didn't stop to think if they should
Marisa (Weeb): one of my classmates in high school ate one and sometimes i think about it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): interesting concept though
Erik (Red Riot Thot): apples are good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): people like grapes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): now if they could make green apples taste like green grapes, that would be a significant improvement
Marisa (Weeb): copyright that
Marisa (Weeb): patent it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👀 Apparently my professor when to Rutgers... interesting lol
Marisa (Weeb): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9-jf9-c9JM
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```By September 28, 2018, recording for the film has ended. Tim Allen said that the film's story was "so emotional" that he "couldn’t even get through the last scene".[31] Similary, Tom Hanks said that the film's ending scene was "a moment in history".```
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My heart isn't prepared
Mark (Mad Doctor): As if I didn't cry enough at the end of Toy Story III
Erik (Red Riot Thot): These toys give me so much anxiety because I will ***RIOT*** if anything bad befalls them
Georgia (Something Sensible): MOOD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, the furnace scene from TS3... I was like *YOU BETTER FUCKING NOT*
Georgia (Something Sensible): someone cancelled their pre order of fallout 76 on amazon so i actually snagged one up in my cart
Georgia (Something Sensible): but its like 200 dollars just to have the game and the power armor helmet so honestly its probably not worth buying
Georgia (Something Sensible): _but damn thats some good luck that i managed to get that right as i was checking amazon_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You realize there’s a reason people are canceling preorders right?
Georgia (Something Sensible): probably
Georgia (Something Sensible): i figured the demand would still be high because the pre order sold out hours after it was announced
Georgia (Something Sensible): but i guess people are hearing that the power armor is shit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was talking about the game itself hun.
Jess (whoozica): alot people played the beta  and lost interest in a few hours D:
Jess (whoozica): thats why they cancelled their preorders
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just saw an article where the headline was "Can't uninstall beta unless you buy the game" 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): WOW really
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Apparently has tons of micro transactions too.
Georgia (Something Sensible): cause im not gonna play it til next tuesday (i have exams so i purposely left my PS4 home) but i thought about pre-ordering it to make sure i could get a copy
Jess (whoozica): the games super insecure too? i saw a couple reviews and so far nothing good D:
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~*pre-order Spyro instead*~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/12/fallout-76-beta-cant-uninstall/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's the PC version I guess, but still
Georgia (Something Sensible): ooooo man i knew bethesda was fucking up by not making an immersive single player game
Jess (whoozica): ooo yea
Georgia (Something Sensible): FAST TRAVEL COSTS CAPS
Georgia (Something Sensible): WHAT THE FUCK
Georgia (Something Sensible): alright im not pre-ordering ill wait til after exams to see the internet blow up (hue punny) about the new game
Jess (whoozica): das a good idea
Matt (mattmyers25): Stan Lee is dead
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh no.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I googled it and would have killed you for that false alarm.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's not.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Damn
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 🇫
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh damn I just saw this before putting it in vent
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oops
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just heard about it on the radio... I'm unsure how to process this information 😭
Mark (Mad Doctor): I have no idea what to think about this. I'm not sure how far down my list I would have to go before I cast Deadpool as Pikachu. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=310109059833139&id=137360369644466&_rdr
