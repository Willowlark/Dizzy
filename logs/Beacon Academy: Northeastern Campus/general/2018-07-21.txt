Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): life goal of mine: get a bunch of red hawk ammo boxes made up (like with this template https://www.deviantart.com/paintchipranger/art/Red-Hawk-Handgun-Ammunition-RE-4-496264974) and use them in my house. 

When the zombie apocalypse happens and someone is looting my house, they'll think they've found ammo only to find me being a huge weeb.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Goals
Marisa (Weeb): yes good veggietales. a good christian cartoon for a good christian server.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay but Veggietales was my shit as a kid
Erik (slendergiant): *Larry Boy was the ultimate crime fighting super cuke*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): LARRY BOI
Evie (Katheryne Knight): okay but they had kinda a shitty 2d animated spin off of that
Erik (slendergiant): They also ruined my childhood with the reboot. What are these monstrosities?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof yeah 
The fuck happened to Madam Blueberry???
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That wasn’t terribly hard.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~excuse me while I'm stupidly proud of myself for a really simple thing; I'm not good with my hands so I expected this to completely fail~~
Erik (slendergiant): 👏
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): aww they don't have a magnum round version.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Louder for the people in the back*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This is irrelevant to everyone but Rebecca and Jaime really, but I *hate* looking on the back of my camera cause it always looks worse than on a real screen.
Marisa (Weeb): THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
"wow this is the best shot of the day it's great"
