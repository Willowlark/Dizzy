Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone please add to the Georgia’s luck counter
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m at a basketball game with Noah and Tyler and they were launching free stuff with the launchers and I was like fuck it I’m tired and sat down
Georgia (Something Sensible): And a free hot dog landed in my lap a second later
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMAO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *free weiner* <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~also kinda ew? Were they launching food? Cause like umm~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh right that existed.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh no it came in a bag it’s okay
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay that's better lol. Still though... *free weiner* <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Anna (Cadmium): Just. Flying hot dog. Great mental image
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Guys such cool cosplayers have been following me back recently and I'm like... why?? I am but a pleb. I deserve no such notice by such cool people 😱
Anna (Cadmium): BECAUSE U AWESOME
Anna (Cadmium): THAT WHY

Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😱
Georgia (Something Sensible): Fun lifehack, wear shorts to bed in freezing weather so when you yeet yourself awake in the morning, you’re doubly woken up
Anna (Cadmium): Let us know how that goes tomorrow morning lmao
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sorry to break it to you, but your half asleep mind will use how cold it is as an excuse to get to the warmest place possible; namely back under the covers.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The secret to mornings is a classic bell alarm clock.
Marisa (Mawisa): There’s a story somewhere about a guy who claimed to do that. Conditioned himself to yeet out of bed in the morning by literally throwing himself off the bed when the alarm goes off. So now he just jumps/tosses himself awake each morning
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hoping this is my last week in the Harrisburg Main branch. I wanna go back to the quietness of Hummlestown
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm always worried that lady is gonna come back
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao I haven't had this on professor in quiet a while since had to take medical leave so when I just walked into class and he looked at me I was like whimsy the fuck are you?! ~~he grew facial hair so he looks so different~~
Jess (whoozica): Nah fam wake yourself up by immediately going out into 8 degree weather to turn your car on
Georgia (Something Sensible): Fuck it’s cold
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GUYS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GUYSVDBDHHXHX
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM CRYING MYSELF INTO 2020
Marisa (Mawisa): [you put on your robe and wizard hat]
Anna (Cadmium): pls no pass out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OMG!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM FUCKING DEAD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 2019 IS WILD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I have soon to be famous lipstick giraffes signature on my arm*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I think it's safe to say every cosplay past katsu is on hold until I finish this very important project for arryn fucking zech
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm going to pass out lmao
Anna (Cadmium): ill make your mask dw
Anna (Cadmium): just. sew like youve never sewed before
Anna (Cadmium): <@!387456543421104150>  *i see u with that shoutout on alli's insta 👀*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is Monica also famous now?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~also source on this robe, I don’t twitter~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Lol she asked people to dm her for shout outs and I was like hey why not
Anna (Cadmium): * *aggressively showers with love* *
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm still small fry 😂
Anna (Cadmium): ~~she still called u a makeup queen~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): What can I say? I've been doing Salem's makeup for almost 2 years lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~whose alli~~
Jess (whoozica): bishamon from anyc 2018
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg are you actually making it for her <@!334090409389195266> 😍
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Did she say yea? 😄
Erik (Red Riot Thot): apparently I made a viral Instagram countdown because someone shared my Katsucon countdown and now other people are sharing it from them so I keep getting notifications that people are sharing my countdown xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everyone is so famous this morning. I feel a tear of joy coming on.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think yours is being shared the most because you added (fucccckkk) into XD
Cause that's a big mood
Erik (Red Riot Thot): probably
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and by "viral" I mean "one of my mutuals shared it and then 3 other people that don't follow me shared it"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I know i saved it specifically for that reason lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@!169297844874903552> yea im making it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I had forgot my noise canceling headphones last time I went into the office (thursday). Boy I can't live without these things now.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeeeett!! ❤
Erik (Red Riot Thot): THAT'S SO COOL LEANNA
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😭
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but yeah, what is the origin of the robe thing?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in her livestream reaction to the episode she was answering fan questions at the end
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and someone asked if she would ever cosplay blake again
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and she said "I mean, i'm not super comfortable in revealing clothes like blake is, so if i did it would only be for the fans. However, i do REALLY want Blake's PJ robe, if anyone knows anyone who would want to make that please message me or something!"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and like i guess no one did???? so i @ed her on twitter
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "hey arryn, if you still want someone to make Blake's robe i'd love to do it!"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's awesome
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and she liked it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am honestly shocked that like no one did. Like wow... but lucky you!!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): make sure to add a bee somewhere
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i thought oh she doesnt actually, she just liked my tweet which is cool in itself
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but then she messaged me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i cried
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That bee is her artist signature.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i definitely will be adding a bee
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): obviously xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leanna, but the a's are bees.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *not that the a's are b's. That would be strange.*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): xD bill what
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You gotta sew a signature in there. You've seen Ladybug, Marinette does that.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lebnnb
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): le 🐝 nn 🐝
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That is so freaking amazing Leanna
Georgia (Something Sensible): Everyone have a KICKASS day today y’all
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean Leanna’s already having one but EVEN MORE KICKASS
Georgia (Something Sensible): _kick more asses_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If Leanna has any more kickass in her day she'll have a heart attack.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if anyone is NOT having a kickass day, i have enough energy to kick the days ass for them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): https://tenor.com/view/kickass-kicksomeass-kick-ass-phoebe-gif-5019273
Anna (Cadmium): i am on a wild goose chase of a project so kick some asses for me
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m currently motivated as FUCK too but let’s see how class at 10:20 changes that
Anna (Cadmium): GET THAT BREAD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've been on twitter and tumblr all morning so I've got like, no motivation going on lol
Anna (Cadmium): *YEET THAT WHEAT*
Georgia (Something Sensible): ***YEETS CALC 5***
Georgia (Something Sensible): I got to this campus early cause it’s the one with the Dunkin’ mmmm
Anna (Cadmium): SPEAKING OF DUNKIN yea fuck this project i have to find dunkin drivethrus in westchester county NY and theres like ONE
Anna (Cadmium): ~~also calc can go die unless youre actually taught by someone who speaks english~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *PFFT* a mood.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fucking STEM demographics.
Anna (Cadmium): mine wrote his own textbook and one of my friends took the class when the book was "three manuscripts, somewhere in the applied math & statistics building"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OOOoh, I had a professor with the same yellow notepad he used when he was learning the material 30 years ago.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He'd use his own notes to teach.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Dr Xu man.
Georgia (Something Sensible): None of my Calc profs had English as their first language
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Teaching the value of teamwork when the entire class realizes they need to work together to get their graduate degrees.
Anna (Cadmium): to be fair i would trust him more
But like. would go the entire class teaching something in someones approach, then say "Kevin's method is wrong." and cross the entire thing out and say he would teach us the right way next class
Anna (Cadmium): *THAT DOESNT HELP ME SIR*
Anna (Cadmium): <@!184437198865563648>  honestly.  we still talk in the group chat we had from college.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the best math prof I ever had was British and he was amazing. Taught from his own notes but he was actually good. Never required a textbook. Bless you Dr. Watling
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he was goofy as hell and tried to be funny and chuckled after like every sentence
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I lost touch with all my graduate class in CS. Most of them were more interested in studying than having fun and I'm not about that.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but he was a great professor and graded super fairly
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My job is enjoyable, but exists to fund my livestyle of enjoying everything else I want to do.
Anna (Cadmium): ~~my job is boring but like. pays for things~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~that's still me too tho~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): My job would be fun assuming I can get it 😅
Georgia (Something Sensible): Rocket science is hard
Georgia (Something Sensible): _wait_ im a girl I’ll be fine
Anna (Cadmium): sanitary system design. 
boring. af.
Anna (Cadmium): *parking lot gradings*
Anna (Cadmium): ok i lied the interesting part is code compliance
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m 27 minutes early to class and I’m somehow still not the first one
Georgia (Something Sensible): We are 5 for 5 for non English first language professors
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We have a couple non english first language professors in my comm dept
Georgia (Something Sensible): For all my calcs, in order, my teachers were first french, Greek, Indian, Russian, and now Chinese
Georgia (Something Sensible): Rutgers diverse as FUCK
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also looks like in a class of 15 so far, two girls, that’s better than average 😅
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *The average is 0 so by existing you broke that*
Georgia (Something Sensible): The average for physics is 1 Girl for every 9 Bois
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tho the physics majors get lumped with the engineering majors for purposes of math
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I’m prob in a class with predominantly engineers
Anna (Cadmium): ~~mine were american, chinese, chinese.~~ but i also only took 3 calcs in college
Georgia (Something Sensible): 3 GIRLS NOW
Anna (Cadmium): its the mechies and electrical eng with u
Anna (Cadmium): civ doesnt take more than calc 4
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~lotta frat bro lookin dudes here wtf~~
Anna (Cadmium): are they wearing salmon shorts
Georgia (Something Sensible): 4 GIRLS WHOA
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nah varsity jackets and The Haircut™️
Georgia (Something Sensible): and one guy has like the ugliest piece of NASA apparel I’ve ever seen
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s like neon yellow
Anna (Cadmium): PICS
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’M SITTING TOO FAR I’ll try to get it at the end
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s like a neon yellow jacket with NASA on the butt
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): go make some friends.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): the girls, not the frat guys.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): NASsA <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hue I get it you combined NASA with butts
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ok we prob got 20 kids, 4 of which are girls
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s... 20% that’s better than usual
Rebecca (madameterralupus): https://tenor.com/view/mlp-20cooler-gif-8961679
ZombieHunter: I start tonight and I don’t even remember what I have
ZombieHunter: Communications I think
Erik (Red Riot Thot): One of our local customers came in to pick up a harness we're had done and sitting since July came in to finally pick it up and he goes "How are you feeling? Last time I saw you you had a cold!" And I was like.... *Uhhh, did I?*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The last time I saw him was probably like May or June and I don't remember having a cold then xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Is that what you told your office you were doing over RTX* 😏
Erik (Red Riot Thot): RTX was August lol
ZombieHunter: Lmfao
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.facebook.com/spacetimecoordinates/videos/2396704773890353?sfns=mo this *screams* <@!245270932602486784>
Jess (whoozica): ~~biru i was keeping that in my back pocket for her birthday~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Calc 5 breakdown: 1/4 girls, 1/4 frat guy lookin dudes, 1/4 nerdy lookin shy guys, and 1/4 very sleep deprived looking guys who would maybe kill for an A
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): again, go make some girl friends.
Anna (Cadmium): also befriend one or two of the sleep deprived ppl
Anna (Cadmium): i most often found those were the ones who understand everything but are always just tired
Georgia (Something Sensible): Their bedhead game is strong
Georgia (Something Sensible): Gravity defying actually
Georgia (Something Sensible): And as expected they took a poll and everyone is physics in that class basically
Georgia (Something Sensible): Except me and another guy whos actually an officer in physics club
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Talking at lunch: one of the IBMers a my coworker just don’t fold laundry.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is that. Normal.
Jess (whoozica): eh. i man its pretty common id say?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ye I only fold shirts
Jess (whoozica): like they just have a clean basket and pick from there
Jess (whoozica): or they have a closet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wow.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, I don’t fold some stuff, pjs and stuff, but I roll them up so they take less space than a pile.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I hang and fold most my laundry.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My Adam rant got posted to RWBY Nation lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The taiyang proud one?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ohhh boy, that comment section is gonna be atrocious
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://slendergiant-cosplay.tumblr.com/post/182217441217
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ooooh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everyone getting famous now tho damn.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~2019 is sacred~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But like it's such a good post
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It deserves to be shared
Anna (Cadmium): ~~2019 is already better than other years cause i met yall~~
Jess (whoozica): you met me 2018 tho
Jess (whoozica): like 6 hrs before the end
Anna (Cadmium): fair. 
most of my knowing you has been 2019
that was 2018 gearing up for 2019
Jess (whoozica): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I feel like I need to use Twitter now.
Jess (whoozica): so you can be famous?
Anna (Cadmium): join twitter. 
So u can follow me and just watch me complain
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I honestly like Twitter more than FB right now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I barely use FB now
Jess (whoozica): i have like a distint purpose for all the social media i use. like fcebook is for family, insta is for cosplay, tumblr is for art and memes
Jess (whoozica): like i dont share memes on facebook or insta, or post cosplay to facebook or tumblr
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I want to delete my FB badly buy messenger is the  primary communication for most of my friends and events
Anna (Cadmium): facebook is for everyone from college & cosplay. Discord is discord. 
Tumblr is..... how do i have almost 2K followers i havent posted in months. 
Insta is for cosplay. Twitter is for complaining into the void. 
reddit is for memes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Insta for cosplay and photography, Messenger for DMs, Discord for groups ( ❤ )... Beyond that I don't stick to other things well. Twitter replies and conversations don't make sense, nor to Tumblr's.... Tumblr used to be 90% porn so I couldn't check it at work... Reddit I go on and off with.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Facebook to see what's up with the real world.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh, and my RSS reader for news.
Georgia (Something Sensible): A 60 person class of mechanics 1 was whittled down to a 45 person class of mechanics 2
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If you want to interact with famous people, Twitter is your best bet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eh. I wouldn't know who Arryn is if Leanna hadn't been beeing out all weekend.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657> 🐝
Anna (Cadmium): Can we also just appreciate how many bee puns there are

Anna (Cadmium): no hes cosplaying cabbage man
Anna (Cadmium): ~~maybe theres just a normal event happening~~
Jess (whoozica): yo nice
Jess (whoozica): what? normal? event? i do not understand
Anna (Cadmium): i hear its the things that ppl without obsessions do
Matt (mattmyers25): And they turned the gazebo into a drink break area
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they have a pet buying expo there like 3 days before katsu my boss wanted me to go to it but i was like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "dude no"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im not going all the way there for 2 days just to come back gather my cosplay shit and then go BACK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i would be fucking exhausted
Jess (whoozica): ~~if tom breaks out from pet dander at katsu can i sue the gaylord~~
Anna (Cadmium): only if they pay you for the inbetween time
Anna (Cadmium): oh no is he allergic to cats ill make sure i get all the cat hair off my stuff <@!351471675843411978>
Jess (whoozica): ye he allergic to cats and dogs but hes usually ok as long as he doesn't like stuff his face into something full of cat hair or like use it as a towel
Jess (whoozica): well have allergy meds on us too
Anna (Cadmium): i will makes sure not to bring a lump of cat hair to the gaylord
Matt (mattmyers25): So many normie, help!!!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Jess (whoozica): get in cosplay
Anna (Cadmium): As Crunch sheds an incredible amount
Anna (Cadmium): ok so what u do
Jess (whoozica): ask someone to take pics
Anna (Cadmium): find photo spots and mark them out and. photoshop them in as backgrounds
Matt (mattmyers25): I'm wearing a d.va hoodie, does that count as cosplay?
Anna (Cadmium): sell empty backdrops of the gaylord photo spots at certain locations and heights as stock photos
Anna (Cadmium): ~~pretend you only just woke up from magfest~~
Matt (mattmyers25): Ummm
Matt (mattmyers25): Maybe haha
Anna (Cadmium): shotgun a redbull and start singing anime intros. normie is infectious to nerds
Jess (whoozica): stumble out of elevator and be like "whoa what day is it? is magfest over?"
Matt (mattmyers25): But these are all professionals lol
Matt (mattmyers25): Hmmm, maybe I can get a job while here haha
Jess (whoozica): get job at the gaylord.
employee discount for katsu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~or have to work during katsu~~
Jess (whoozica): epitome of unproductivity: "ill go to lunch after i finish this compilation of memes"
ZombieHunter: Not a real spoiler but to my homestuck:
ZombieHunter: 
ZombieHunter: <@!301927856240459777>
Jamie (Jamie): Red fabric is weird
Matt (mattmyers25): So there is a circus coming to national harbor the same time as katsu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is it the con goers
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you know it.
Matt (mattmyers25): Nope. It Is tr he big apple circus
Matt (mattmyers25): The
Anna (Cadmium): take a shot every  time in public you get asked if youre there with the circuis
Mark (Mad Doctor): Poor Pennywise cosplayers get mistaken for the real deal. And vice versa
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > gets mints for ride home
> holds out cvs card
> waits
> “this is Walgreens”
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if chilis had its own car, this would be georgia every time she goes to another chain
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Hi, welcome to...wait, is this Chili's?"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I'm reading the comments on my post that got shared to RWBY Nation and surprisingly they're not too bad. There's actually a bunch of people opening up about situations with abusive exes they've escaped from and a lot are actually male. It's interesting to see 1) that men can be victims of abuse as well and 2) men opening up about their feelings in general
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was never fond of Adam as a villain, but I found his dialogue in the last two episodes frighteningly chilling. Sounds like he rang true for a lot of people
Anna (Cadmium): kudos to his voice actor too cause i would have vomited having to act that out
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@386874959009415170> thats great! A good change of pace from what usually happens in that fb group! Sounds like what you said really resonated with them
ZombieHunter: RWBY nation is a page not a group
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I dont know the difference
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm not on fb a lot xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Woops
ZombieHunter: A page is where anyone can post things that show on your page
ZombieHunter: group
Mark (Mad Doctor): RWBY seems to have two categories of villains: the evil (Salem, Tyrian) and the awful (Adam, Jacques, Shitley). Of the two, the latter group seems to stir revulsion
ZombieHunter: A page is where the where of the page can posy yhibgw for people to like and share
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ohhhhhh see I didnt know that
ZombieHunter: There’s evil and then there’s the abusive I’d say <@!386567060026556417>
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah, I just think it's notable how the characters we really hate aren't the villains of the main story, but the ones who are cruel to others
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think to be fair I should add a third category: villains with complex motives that are open to redemption: Emerald, Hazel, maybe Cinder
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Possibly mercury too
ZombieHunter: Truth. Mercury’s story and his semblance being stolen would make a psycho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Generic evil is boring though. It’s engaging to be afraid for the characters you like in a story. Jessica Jones is a parallel, that story was thrilling not because of special effects of world changing plots, but because it was so deeply personal to Jessica and her life.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ... that would be a hella good AU.
