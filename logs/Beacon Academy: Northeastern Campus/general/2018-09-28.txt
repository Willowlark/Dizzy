Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): OK BUT AQUA GOT NORTED
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Erik would be proud of me.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have embraced the Erik.
Erik (slendergiant): Did you buy the thing?
Erik (slendergiant): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMsH_3cRKeI
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!184437198865563648> 40 hrs late but you don’t understand that being Norted™ pretty much is like...the end of the line in KH
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): About Kingdome Hearts XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What did I say tho.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You posted the video about casual fans vs. hardcore fans, and the “hardcore” fan screams “AQUA GOT NORTED”
Being Norted in Kingdom Hearts is basically the end of the line
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You get body snatched by the main villain and he uses you as a vessel to bring about the end of the world basically
Erik (slendergiant): That was me who posted the video lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye lol
Marisa (Weeb): kingdom hearts iii had a really nice booth at tgs ~~and a line that capped like 20 minutes after they opened~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): D A M N
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shit sorry <@!386874959009415170>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Tells you how awake I am
Marisa (Weeb): wake up y'all
Marisa (Weeb): i don't know what time it is
oh wait yes i do
Marisa (Weeb): it's selfie time
Marisa (Weeb): go
Marisa (Weeb): ***go***
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you have to start the chain then~~
Marisa (Weeb): ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Marisa (Weeb): ya u gotta start it then
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you already didn't post one in Aurii~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Y’all I was dickin around with the health app on my phone
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think college... actually makes you healthy
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s my average steps for the last year, like what the heck, I walked so much cause of class during the year
Erik (slendergiant): Makes sense since you're walking everywhere
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Walking to class was probably the most exercise I've done in the last few years.
Erik (slendergiant): Walking to class while carrying a 20+ lb backpack
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Going to CS out for a hot second: I’m super proud of this utility script I wrote in the last half hour. It can load a sql command either directly from the command line, from a file containing the command (sometimes sql commands are long bois) or from a json file which lets you refer to a query with a short name (ie testme = <long as query>) AND for human readability the json can store a list of single line commands which get merged into the long boi automatically.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s four different ways to provide the query, and it took like... 15 lines.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~Erik what language is he speaking it sounds so foreign~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~who was supposed to be learning coding yesterday again~~
Erik (slendergiant): He wrote a code that does something neat I'm guessing
Jess (whoozica): yea georgia, how could you not learn the entirety of coding in one night, gawd
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wasn’t learning I was doing researchhhh
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m gonna learn C++ for high energy physics first, and cause I was told I should do that before Python
Georgia (Something Sensible): And then I’m using Python for astrophysics
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *oof*
Erik (slendergiant): The only "programming" I ever did in college was using Matlab to run calculations. I was really bad at it and my professor basically told me how to do our in-class problems because I had so many questions...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): C++ is way harder than Pyrhon.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I was told to learn it first and then Python will seem like cake
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Meanwhile, I refuse to go back to lower level languages because Python is so much better than Java or C.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Which is why I'm in data science; the trend is to use Python!
Georgia (Something Sensible): Astrophysics too
Georgia (Something Sensible): But high energy will need C++
Georgia (Something Sensible): And though I’m not specializing in high energy, I’ll still have to _do_ it
Georgia (Something Sensible): Knowledge of coding is apparently one of the only things I’m missing with my NASA application
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): As for what I did; 12 lines of code make
```
ipython run_query.py select * from bpcm.iqense_data 
ipython run_query.py query.sql
ipython run_query.py query.json get_everything
ipython run_query.py query.json load_multiline
```
valid inputs.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The difference between the last lines shown in the query.json file,

```
{
    "test": "select distinct EOM_PRIMARY_SALES_REP_IND from bluadmin.ims",
    "iqense": [
            "select i.* from bpcm.iqense_data i",
            "join bpcm.cmc_data c",
            "on i.claim_id = c.claim_id",
            "and c.clm_submit_date >= '09-01-2018';"
    ]
}
```
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I would be surprised if NASA isn't using Python for number crunching.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you learned the utilities I use, you'd be golden I'm sure.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did they say anything specifically for NASA?
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s the department
Georgia (Something Sensible): Astro is Python for sure but different subsections use diff stuff
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh, Astro is NASA, not Rutgers?
Georgia (Something Sensible): both lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): conveniently
Georgia (Something Sensible): python is the science big boi of programming ive always got the impression so
Georgia (Something Sensible): _time to learn the language of the 🐍 _
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It is.
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-si9QFUXkItieY
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That and R, but R is the devil as far as I'm concerned.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Python is universal though! Dizzy is written in Python.
Jess (whoozica): you guys: coding 
Me: https://www.buzzfeed.com/joannaborns/who-is-your-potato-boyfriend?bfsource=ovthpvariant
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): G A S P. You, my (alleged) wife, looking for a boyfriend. How cruel.
Marisa (Weeb): Georgia gonna get a pet snake
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.hackathon.com/event/2018-nasa-space-apps-hackathon---kitchener-waterloo-region-49395615616 Canada main office is doing a NASA hackathon apparently too.
Georgia (Something Sensible): im gonna speak parseltongue to qualify for a job
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~maybe if parseltongue sounded like regular language~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think if i could be the master of snakes, NASA would have to hire me
Georgia (Something Sensible): i would open up the possibility for space snakes
Erik (slendergiant): *Hesssha hasssssssa*
Marisa (Weeb): SNASA, or Snake NASA
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you want parseltongue, you don't want Python.

```
print "I'm a snake."
```
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's Python.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): MEANWHILE, C:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("I'm a snake.");
   return 0;
}
```

Erik (slendergiant): I *guess* we can share him <@!245270932602486784>

Georgia (Something Sensible): or are we poly
Georgia (Something Sensible): you GUESS
Marisa (Weeb): Many fries
Georgia (Something Sensible): I would like him tuesdays, wednesdays, and saturdays

Marisa (Weeb): Where’s the secret yandere potato route
Erik (slendergiant): Works for me
Georgia (Something Sensible): glad we could come to an understanding
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *oh my god this page is full of sin*
Marisa (Weeb): Sin, or snake in
Erik (slendergiant): Soil, or snake oil
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://esolangs.org/wiki/Hello_world_program_in_esoteric_languages The basic program everyone starts with is to print "Hello World".

*You’re a friendly person, but also someone who doesn’t take a lot of crap from anyone. You can be a little neurotic from time to time, but that comes with the territory. Once you trust a person, there’s nothing that can separate the two of you. You’re a good person to know.*
Erik (slendergiant): Accurate
Jess (whoozica): You got: Pineapple juice
You’re a sociable person — someone who takes their friends and family seriously. You’re loyal, and never one to turn your back on a pal. You love a good ol’ fashioned get-together, something fun and not too wild.
