Erik (slendergiant): <@386567060026556417> here's a good debate fir your nerd club next year
Jamie (Jamie): The answer is no it can not
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wow, I can see a whole series of debates of these imponderables: infinity gauntlet or ring of power? DeathbStar vs Ego, the living planet?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): so <@!169297844874903552> and <@!386624706612297729> , plus anyone else who might, do you have a Compact Flash card?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Older DSLR take them, they like jumbo sd cards.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't think so. Cause I don't own a DSLR right now and all my SD cards are the normal size lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): fooie.
Jess (whoozica): 🤔  my dad or brother may?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So I have a neighbor whose a wedding photographer and he's prepping to move, so he's kinda been dumping gear on me. That included three older model nikons (d70, two d200's), lenses, flash equipment, and some other stuff. I was thinking I'd bring them to chestnut hill for anyone who wants to be a photographer out of our group, or in the case of you and Jaime, try out a DSLR (I think Jaime doesn't have a DSLR either? I realize I don't know). Catch is he only gave me 2 compact flash, and all three older bodies only take compact flash.
Jess (whoozica): yea my dad def. used to have those
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh okay. That'd be really cool~ 😄 ❤ 
 I could see if my friend whom does my photos a lot has one. Cause she uses DSLR's all the time 😮
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's not like you can't buy them, I just won't use them (I have my first DSLR as a backup which uses SD) so I don't want to drop 30 bucks on one.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): course I also need a reader for it, sigh.
Jess (whoozica): i had one of those 900 years ago too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think I got rid of the one that could read compact flash too.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mine just reads XQD (fancy new card type that only my new DSLR takes) and sd.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yup.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Same thing applies to buying the card though. I won't use it beyond this lending scenario.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and while I like being able to do it, I already had to buy some body caps and a replacement battery door and I'm like eeeeh.
Jess (whoozica): ill ask my dad about both
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have my own Great One now 👌🏻
Erik (slendergiant): She's beautiful
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Someone smash my face in so I can do an accurate Great One cosplay for RTX
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.hydroflask.com/64-oz-growler/color,olive,a,92,o,140 They make hot cold bottles specifically for beer now, apparently.
Erik (slendergiant): Why would you want...
Erik (slendergiant): ...a hot bottle...
Erik (slendergiant): ...of beer...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): hot cold.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It keeps it cold.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.hydroflask.com/?utm_source=avantlink&utm_medium=affiliate&avad=217145_d12592f85 Wine too.
Erik (slendergiant): But it's hot cold meaning, should you want a hot beer, it will keep it hot
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm confused as to what the difference is between alot of these.
Erik (slendergiant): Probably zero
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Well maybe tea drinkers like flasks too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've put tea in a coffee tumbler before.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can never get the sugar to tea ratio right though.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Lol I don't usually put sugar in my tea anymore cause I'm a weirdo and my tolerance for sugar has gone down severely over the past couple of years
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): lucky you, makes it easier to brew a cup.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I have about as much sugar as Ruby does whoops~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~I put like 6 sweet n lows in my coffee whoops~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): WHAT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeaaaaah
Erik (slendergiant): *flavored creamer*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I feel attacked
