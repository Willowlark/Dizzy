Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): <@!386567060026556417> If Audrey ever wants to come on back, I know I speak for all of us when I say we‚Äôd like to have her. You can pass her the link. https://discord.gg/ssDbsK3 (I saw she was asking about cosplay friend groups)
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's kind of you. Audrey is fond of everyone in BNE, and she was touched by your offer. I think she's looking for a crew closer to her own age as she rebuilds her life since she cut ties with a lot of friends from her old school (who were borderline toxic). She once said she found BNE intimidatingly sophisticated
(Yeah, I don't get it eitherüòÜ) but I'm sure she will be happy to hang out at cond
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Course. I wish her the best of luck finding a group she can bond with. (Sophisticated? We‚Äôve got compulsive coffee drinkers, hogwarts builders, at least a dozen people freaking out about tests, and all sorts of other hijinks!)
Georgia (Something Sensible): BNE could be a sketch comedy
Mark (Mad Doctor): True enough!
