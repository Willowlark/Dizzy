Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Darling in the Franxx board game you print yourself.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, it's free so...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I made the box already because I felt that was a better use of my time
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's a little flimsy so I'd def need to print it or paste it onto card stock
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): NICE
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He must *really* want people to make it themselves because you can buy a fully printed and assembled game set for the small price of $75
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *small price* 
Yea yikes... I'd deff would prefer to make it myself over that cost. Also would give me a task to do to entertain myself for a bit XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, the last time he tried to sell a game (fire emblem based) Nintendo send him a C&D.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): so.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I get why he'd avoid it.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): unless it's also to pay the artists for using their art
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): don't think that's what he's doing.
