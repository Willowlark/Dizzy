Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WELCOME BACK AUDREY
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): AHHHHH
Evie (Katheryne Knight): HI AUDREY!!!! :D
ZombieHunter: <@!386874959009415170>  what kind of stuff do you guys play? i know people always looking for new bands to build exposure with
ZombieHunter: my best friends are all musicians outside cosplay friends
Erik (Red Riot Thot): We do a mix of classic rock and modern stuff
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like we did Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, the Beatles, and also Green Day, MCR, and FOB
Jamie (Jamie): So quick inspiration post cause quite frankly this passage in one of my arina tanemura art books is really nice to read right at the end considering its coming from a successful manga creator as well 💛💛💛 you never stop being a critic of your own and you never stop getting better💛💛💛
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yo you ever get back from a movie and just need to sit and digest what you watched
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What did you see
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What movie?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Happy Death Day 2 U
Georgia (Something Sensible): You’d think it’s bad cause it’s a sequel but it had a really interesting message about the past
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s basically like “suffering hurts but if you didn’t have those experiences, you wouldn’t be yourself”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I was just like DAMN
Jamie (Jamie): Ahh I want to see that so bad! I only recently watched the first one so
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEA IT WAS GOOD
Georgia (Something Sensible): I was just like [reaction image of the guy patting his moist forehead with a rag]
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof that's a relatable message
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, if I hadn't gone through my breakup, there's a good chance I wouldn't know y'all
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah!
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like you go through hell and you feel like it’s just gonna keep sucking, but you get to a point down the road where you look back like “that was important for me to become a better person”
Erik (Red Riot Thot): A little off the topic of that message, but somewhat related, but it blows the fuck out of my mind when I can trace back a pivotal moment in my life that, had it not gone as it did, would drastically have changed my life
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee 👆
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But yeah, back on topic, going through what I did, and even before things went south, that whole experience helped me grow as a person
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee some experiences can be really painful but in the end they help you grow, and you come out on the other end better
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah like I was the shittiest Georgia back in September but I learned a fuck ton about myself
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I was MISERABLE
Georgia (Something Sensible): But I’m so much emotionally and mentally stronger 💪💪
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Our experiences, good and bad, make up who we are. You wouldn’t be you without every heartbreak and fought-for success. Never regret the things you do and steps you’ve taken, because without them you wouldn’t even be you. Butterfly effect could take place and everything would be different.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Without proper challenges we could’ve all grown up as jerks that hated each other
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. Like there's times I get really down in the dumps cause I miss having an SO to do things with but I remember I am better off w/o him now. I have grown so so much as a person since then. I have room to spread my wings w/o anyone holding me down. I also get bitter still over my old best friend ghosting me but I remember that I have much better friends (all of you) now compared to those of my shitty past
Georgia (Something Sensible): Exactly!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Gotta go through a ton of pain and shit to get to the good shit
Georgia (Something Sensible): NO PAIN NO GAIN
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like Kiera came into my room the other day asking for advice about boys
Georgia (Something Sensible): And she hadn’t had a relationship before so she was like “is it ok this guy sounds like he’s cheating on me?”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And like DAMN I could help her cause I was there my freshman year
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Georgia (Something Sensible): It feels good knowing that my past experiences can help others avoid unnecessary pain
Georgia (Something Sensible): This movie got me sitting here like
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee. I feel the same. I sometimes worry on giving advice since I feel like I'm not a winner in the relationship department after last one lol but so far my advice has been good it seems?? Also when people have issues that I feel are close to what I was having I'm like mhhmm okay let's crack down on this and get it fixed. Don't end up like me lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): You get the whole “don’t turn out like me, kid” vibe LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah there’s a lot of stuff I don’t like or regret or whatever. But I don’t really angst about it because I’m happy that I’m who I am today. So. I wouldn’t change I thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): I love myself and you guys and my family and my prospects for the future 💕
Rebecca (madameterralupus): P much! I'm like oof... don't go through the shit I went through. Let me help you.
I try to keep a high head about my experiences but oof depression hates me sometimes so I overthink a looott and let stuff bother me sometimes still... but we working on it ❤ I am overall glad of where I am today. My mom today was telling family she hasn't seen me smiling and laughing this much for a long time sooo guess I'm doing okay XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah you got a kickass support network, at the bare minimum
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ❤ Heck yeeee
Georgia (Something Sensible): Anyways thanks for comin to my FEELSY ASS TED TALK
Jamie (Jamie): Y'all preaching what i've learned over the years. I went through shit but have been able to become less angry about certain events and move past things easier when i realized that well now i've learned and i wouldnt be here if I didnt go through that moment of total nope.
Georgia (Something Sensible): “Total nope” is a mood
Jamie (Jamie): YUP
Georgia (Something Sensible): And like, I like y’all the way you are too
Georgia (Something Sensible): I can’t imagine any version of you guys that’s worse just because you didn’t have a certain experience
Georgia (Something Sensible): I can’t imagine a boring Erik or a selfish Rebecca or a cold Jamie
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like damn y’all are fun and helpful and friendly
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 💕💕💕
Jamie (Jamie): Oof cold me rebecca has heard dem stories of that time lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee ☝🏻
Jamie (Jamie):

Anna (loud and likely blonde): Someone help me it's been a half hour and I'm still filled with emotions about how much I love shinsou hitoshi
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I haven't had emotions like this since I fell into bees
Georgia (Something Sensible): is there a difference between prinounciation of owo and ouo
Georgia (Something Sensible): is one "oh-woah" and one "oo-woo"
Georgia (Something Sensible): noah wants to know "which one hes supposed to say to be funny, and which one is a cringe-y anime reference"
Marisa (Mawisa): They’re faces so they don’t get pronounced right? Like how we don’t pronounce : ) or 😎
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like UwU should be "oo-woo" and OwO should be "oh-whoa" but "oh-whoa" sounds weird so I say "oo-woo"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO - eu woo 
I'd say they pronounced close to the same
Marisa (Mawisa): wait do people pronounce emoji too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I say OwO out loud a lot. Cause I'm weird xD
Georgia (Something Sensible): conclusion: i saw oo-woo irregadless what the emoji construction is
Marisa (Mawisa): But is a face??
Georgia (Something Sensible): _faces have sounds_
Marisa (Mawisa): !!??!????
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I pronounce :3 as "colon three"
Marisa (Mawisa): What sound is 🌚
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *a concerning sound*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *the sound of doom??*
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel a definite "hrk" sound from that
Marisa (Mawisa): Oh so like majoras mask
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't pronounce :3 I just make the face as best as I can when read it xD
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:pewish:420824457918152704> this is a "hue"  face to me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ yes
Marisa (Mawisa): ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ
Marisa (Mawisa): what sound is that
Georgia (Something Sensible): fear
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol wtf xD
Marisa (Mawisa): I can’t believe emoji have sounds
What next, words?
Marisa (Mawisa): Magnet noises. Those exist.
Georgia (Something Sensible): nyoom
Georgia (Something Sensible): easy noise
Marisa (Mawisa): Wubba lubba dub dub goes through my brain and I’m immediately taken out by a sniper rifle
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me: I deserve a break from physics
Georgia (Something Sensible): PS4: plz do a 4 hour update
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me: back to physics I go
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): Uh? It jumped down to 4 mins ok
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My xbox was acting up and like, not opening apps, couldn't uninstall apps, couldn't connect to xbox live. So I hard reset it and it was like "hey you need to update"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Technology is gr8
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I was like
