Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Well where's my Salem shit?!?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They have a shirt on the RT site!
Idk if it’s still in stock
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I didn't see one when I looked
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I saw the nuckelavee art tho
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It was released when the Qrow shirt was but I think it’s discontinued
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Damn
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah it sucks a lot of stuff I wanted is discontinued
Erik (slendergiant): I hate when they leave their discontinued merch up on the site tho. Like all the Geoff shirts? There's dozens up there but they're all *retired*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Saaammmeee. There's stuff I see on the site I want but then see it's discontinued or sold out when click on it 😦
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanna do a story video of me testing the handmedown studio flash I’ve jimmied into my heavier tripod mount, tethered to my camera, my camera transferring pictures over Bluetooth to my tablet.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The stupid Bluetooth transfer takes too long though, whole process is longer that 10 seconds.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Suppose I could tether my my laptop if I grab that cable...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): what kind of stupid am I if I look at the test flash button, then look at the flash, then press the button?
Erik (slendergiant): Not too bright if you ask me
you want fucking rwby chibi?: oh sweet a ~~me~~ neon shirt
