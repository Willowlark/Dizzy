ZombieHunter: So
ZombieHunter: How long does anyone wait to do laundry
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~until i have no clothes left to wear~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That was me in college. Now I do it in the one time I manage to have time for it every 2 weeks.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): When I run out of pants
Marisa (Weeb): when the weather is decent and i'm home because apparently no one uses dryers
ZombieHunter: Me right now though
ZombieHunter: I’m doing laundry only because I’m running out of clothes
ZombieHunter: >.>
Erik (slendergiant): In college I was good about doing it every Saturday. Now it's whenever I run out of underwear
ZombieHunter: Thank you for your
ZombieHunter: ....shirts
ZombieHunter: See. Erik
ZombieHunter: That doesn’t work for me
ZombieHunter: Cuz the last time I did ALL my laundry
ZombieHunter: I had about 30 boxers
ZombieHunter: ....
ZombieHunter: :3
Erik (slendergiant): I'm good about doing my laundry. It's folding it is the issue. I just did a load last night and it will probably sit in my hamper until the weekend while my dirty clothes pile up on the floor
ZombieHunter: Mood
ZombieHunter: I’m in my basement trying to figure out what I’m doing
ZombieHunter: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Erik (slendergiant): I guess it more frequent for me because I only own 12 pairs lol
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I have enough underwear to not do laundry for like 3months but I only own like 15 pairs of leggings so…
Jess (whoozica): We try to do laundry like ever 1.5 weeks id say?
ZombieHunter: Pants are clean until they fail a sniff test
ZombieHunter: jeans at least
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Mood
ZombieHunter: 😂😂
ZombieHunter: I debated saying that cuz I was like
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Or I get paint on them 😂
ZombieHunter: I’m either right. Or I’m gross.
ZombieHunter: My friends will decide
ZombieHunter: 😂😂😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Running out of x is definitely the primary motivator for anyone to do laundry.
Erik (slendergiant): I think I've been seeing the same jeans since Saturday or Sunday...
ZombieHunter: I’m out of shorts and it’s still kind of warm
ZombieHunter: Idk if I ever wear pants in summer
ZombieHunter: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I haven’t worn jeans in over a year ✌🏻
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m lazy and I like spandex 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's. wild.
ZombieHunter: I need to wash these shorts
ZombieHunter: But
ZombieHunter: That means I need to find pants
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Totally normal, but like, such a departure from guys where it's shorts, jeans, dress pants.
ZombieHunter: .... :3
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I own a single pair of jeans and I think I’ve worn them like 3 times in the 2 years I’ve owned them
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You don't have too many options.
ZombieHunter: I will wear the prettiest skirt
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): FUCKING DONIT
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Donit
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): DO*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IT*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Do...nut?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): **I CANT TYPE OR SPELL**
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *But can you write*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Nope
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I can’t speak either
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > The first post on my facebook feed:
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I never forget to put my clothes IN the dryer but I ALWAYS forget to take them out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I "forget" because I don't want to fold them.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Lol what is folding
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hang stuff up, its a loophole
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~that's annoying too~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): less annoying though
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I am a fan of
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Piles
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): piles are pretty nice
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): valid
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Thank you
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Valid, Jealous. I couldn't get away with it.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Validate my distinction
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Piles are a human tradition
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): We've been piling since the dawn of time
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Going back to my roots
Marisa (Weeb): we would make homestuck piles of just 30 homestucks piled on top of each other. those were times.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Me: -goes to goodwill looking for a single shirt to wear for pinkday-
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That sounds exciting and terrifying
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That sums up homestuck well.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): LIKE YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD LEAVE WITH A SINGLE SHIRT
Marisa (Weeb): like this. once at zenkaikon like 6 years ago we had a huge one outside.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Me: -ends up buying a pink tee, pink shorts, a pink dress shirt, and a blue flannrl-
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): NO ONE goes to goodwill and leaves with one thing
Marisa (Weeb): have you ever bought pancake mix at goodwill
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That’s mildly concerning
Marisa (Weeb): ya it's not the good kind
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~time to play spot the friend you didn't know was a homestuck in a homestuck picture~~
Marisa (Weeb): do you know someone in that pic
Marisa (Weeb): ~~is it you~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Meg the worse part is i saw more pink clothes and i wanna go back and buy more cause i saw some other clothes i want to try
Marisa (Weeb): AHH EARTHQUAKE ALAERT
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): HAL YOUR BROKE
Marisa (Weeb): WHAT DO i do nothng is shaking but everything is going off
Marisa (Weeb): is it a false alarm i can't stop shakin now
Marisa (Weeb): ~~the alert was for me lol~~
ZombieHunter: Okay but
ZombieHunter: I remember homestuck piles
ZombieHunter: Everyone in a homestuck moment is or was poly at some point
ZombieHunter: Because of fucking quadrants
Marisa (Weeb): they're saying chiba was hit but it's weird we didn't feel anything at all
Marisa (Weeb): especially given the bLARING ALARM MY PHONE LET OUT
Jess (whoozica): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Weeb): hey everyone what's shakin
Marisa (Weeb): goodwill pancake mix < dollar store pancake mix < off-brand pancake mix < actual pancake mix
Marisa (Weeb): 
Jess (whoozica): Apparently the government is testing some new national alert system so heads up everyone its scheduled for 2:18 pm
https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2018/10/02/nationwide-emergency-alert-test-planned-oct-3-test-messages-will-be-sent

Mark (Mad Doctor): They went off over the course of five minutes in my Art History class. The one kid who didn't get one is black. "I find it hard not to draw a conclusion," he said
