Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anyone free this weekend and wanna go to the movies? (I am free Sat or Sun)
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> My dad was a fucking art major and doesn't know who Bob Ross is...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because Bob Ross isn't exactly the kind of artist that's taught in art classes. He didn't start his show until the 80s
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Truuuee but like still 😮 My dad knows so much art stuff I would figure he'd at last know the name or face. Nope.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao my dad are so bad. My mom has several presents under the tree in our basement with no names. We asked her about it the other week and she said we'd find out but it's also for some game?? So now that she is upstairs in bed we are like looking to see if any have names and trying to see if we can figure out what they are from weight, etc XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~We are also confused at the no names cause usually she's so anal about presents having names on them.~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I'm considering wearing my red contacts to a family Christmas party next week just to see people's reactions
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YALL so I just found out a girl I went to high school with (we weren’t friends, she was a good friend of a friend of mine but we never actually talked/hung out) is SUPER into rwby and just did her first cosplay ever as yang! And I’m just like, CAN WE BE FRIENDS???
Erik (Red Riot Thot): DO IT!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): HOW
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): DO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): how did you find out she was into RWBY?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I follow her on twitter and she posted a cos selfie
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): So I went to her page and all she’s tweeted about recently is rwby
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m just never on twitter so I never saw
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Just PM her and be like "Hey! I didn't know you were into RWBY! I really like your Yang cosplay! I cosplay Pyrrha!"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That should be a pretty good convo starter
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You can even lead off with "Hey I'm not sure if you know me, but we went to high school together and were both friends with ____"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I think it’s kinda funny because I’m pretty sure neither of us are friends with our mutual friend from hs anymore 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh awk... lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You can even lead off with "Hey I'm not sure if you know me, but we went to high school together and *used to be* friends with __"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Lol 🤣 perf
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, that was Tom/Jess/I and Leanna.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I got a photo of her Yang at the RWBY shoot at Animenext, ... at some point it was discovered we came from the same high school, QED.
ZombieHunter: I’m reading backlog but when meg messages this high school acquaintance, I hope she responds to “I cosplay pyrrha” with “you cosplay a jar of dust?”
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hunter, you're grounded
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Grounded?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Grounded into dust?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ......
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> <:leanna_pyrrha_scream:514147026741624887> <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> <:leanna_pyrrha_scream:514147026741624887>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's a great pattern.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd use that as a wallpaper border.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wish to make fren with your fren <@327835140216586242>
Mark (Mad Doctor): We should all show up at her home in RWBY cosplay. That should scare her straight
Mark (Mad Doctor): Got a candy cane delivered to my class with a note that will get me through the next few days
Jess (whoozica): Awww ♥️ that's so cute
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): <@227431823062466569> your grounded
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww thats cute Mark 😃
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Umm sir, wtf
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol WAT
Jess (whoozica): WHAT

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I RADIATE BEEFCAKE ENERGH??????
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): * Energy that attracts Beefcake
Jess (whoozica): What a weird thing to say
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is.. is he referring to ..himself as a beefcake
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I don’t know
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): either way, yikes

ZombieHunter: 😃
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😱 I just realized a year ago on Saturday was when most of us all meet each other for the first time! Yay for one year of friendship! ❤ Thanks for being such amazing and loving friends! ❤
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 💖💖💖💖
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I got a notice from the National Eagle Scout Association to call and confirm my file, so I called and the guy answering fumbled his intro, stopped talking, and then hung up. Honestly, mood though
