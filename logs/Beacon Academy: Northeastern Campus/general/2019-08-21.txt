Mark (Mad Doctor): Interesting. According to my source, Renner was the Marvel actor who was least into the fandom. If he's coming out against Sony like this, you can be sure he's the tip of the iceberg
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): OFF TOPIC BUT
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'VE READ THAT SERIES, IT WAS GREAT
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: the terrifying part about this is
i bet that sony wanted more money and disney didnt wanna give it. So the power of public outcry is being used to pressure a deal
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i dont have a source but its terrifying how quick it went from 'breaking news' to everyone enraged to suddenly its back on the table
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Is it already back on the table?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): > Sony: Makes 5 spider man movies
> Sony: Why does no one like spider man
> Marvel: We'll help you make spider man good
> Sony: okay fine
> Marvel: *does*
> Sony: We DoNt NeEd YoU
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: there was a report of a renegotiation i saw go across my twitter feed but i wasnt paying attention
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a28769161/spider-man-mcu-sony-marvel-disney/
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: this dead is like exactly what i said of using public leverage
turns out disney wants 50/50 split
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I mean. It's their property.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Tbh Sony should be happy Disney isn't really throwing their weight around to get the character back entirely.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Sony's also been a shit about the spider man rights for years.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i think sony still owns the right to spiderman but idk how long they've had those rights. 
meanwhile. this is gonna destroy sony bc no ones gonna remember them as into the spiderverse they're gonna be as 'the ppl who tried to ruin mcu spiderman'
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: they should be happy but its also horrifying the grasp disney has & influence
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh, Disney is an evil corporation.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Been saying that for years.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But Sony is also a bunch of dicks so.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They've been trying to ride the coattails of the MCU since the MCU started, but could never get it to work until MCU picked them up in civil war.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): imo anyway.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I see this as greedy corp versus greedy corp with a bigger stick.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Since they're both asses, might as well side with the one that gets me more Tom Holland.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: this is fair
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Sony: we want all the money from spider man
