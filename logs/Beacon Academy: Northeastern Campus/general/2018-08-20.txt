Amazon is running a sale on Nerf guns. It's like my childhood dreams came true.

Just... after I realized how uselessly inaccurate nerf guns are.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah I mean youâ€™d think someone who questioned the existence of giraffes would like. Go to a zoo and try to see one? You know? They have a giraffe in just about every zoo so you could just go and try to determine yourself if it was a weird dog with a big neck brace. But he refused and just insisted that they werenâ€™t real until one day in a museum gift shop he went haywire and tore up all the giraffe dolls and books like a frenzied fanboy who just heard his waifu sucks. 
He had to pay for all the stuff but it looked pretty neat all chewed and torn up in a big pile like a birds nest. Maybe he was the strange dog projecting his insecurities onto the giraffes, idk I havenâ€™t seen him since.
