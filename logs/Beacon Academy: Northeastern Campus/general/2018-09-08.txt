Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm not 😃
Erik (slendergiant): Me neither. Just typical morning tiredness
Marisa (Weeb): How can you be hungover if none of you drank? Of course no one drank because alcohol is illegal, of course.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Of course
Marisa (Weeb): *unless you drank the pool water*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I did that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I dont recommend it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Should definitely be illegal
Erik (slendergiant): A little chlorine never hurt anyone
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Think it's salt water tbhbv

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~little can wake the slumbering sunny little dragon~~
Erik (slendergiant): Ok our Weiss said Georgia was going to let him borrow her ponytail for our group and she hasn't been responding so I guess that's why 😂
Marisa (Weeb): u gotta use scent to wake people up. something that smells like burning.
have y'all used the in-room iron? usually those don't get used often and there's a buildup of minerals inside that get expelled when you first use it and it smells rank. use that to wake her.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is the group soon?
Erik (slendergiant): At 11
Marisa (Weeb): omg it's 11:18pm wake her up
Marisa (Weeb): the con is happenin'

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm sick but I'll still dance to that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Fuck yes
Marisa (Weeb): go up to her and whisper 「お姫様、もうお目覚めの時間です。早く起きてくださいませ。」
Marisa (Weeb): tell her there's an unread mystic mess chatroom that's gonna expire soon
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ok. I'm here. There's a cosplay dance fitness panel which started at ten. There is a new bar for evil
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You right.
