Georgia (Something Sensible): im lowkey proud i did no "treat yo self"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like our wasn't too bad this year. The checkout line at Joann's wasn't long at all and I asked the cashier and they said it wasn't nearly as bad as years past. I also had no wait checking out at Walmart. I think the hype has been lessened since they started doing sales on Thanksgiving as well as online
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And Georgia, same
Jess (whoozica): Yea alot of people don't go as crazy anymore
Matt (mattmyers25): When I wemt to Verizon, I only waited an hour to get my new phone
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We were busy at our store but never had long lines maybe 3 people waiting max but we had like 4-6 people running register. It was steady and the store wasn't terrible to clean up either thank god üôåüèª
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I bought contacts, a wig, and a zentai pattern online and then got fabric and other stuff for Christmas/normal Kirishima üòÇ

Mark (Mad Doctor): I took Mrs MD and son to the King of Prussia Mall yesterday when we went to pick up Audrey from her program at 2:00. I was planning to go in, too, but we spent 40 minutes in traffic trying to get into the parking lot. Wife and kid reported total chaos inside. I guess the "destination mall" still draws them in
Georgia (Something Sensible): I heard a lot of malls were relatively quiet wow
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I could imagine KOP still being crowded
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah, the only reason I agreed to go was because I went to a relatively quiet mall on the afternoon of Black Friday two years ago. KOP is it's own world
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Look how one of my mutuals (who is a weiss main) got picked up. This is amazing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's incredible
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg that's awesome
Tom (tomukuncosplay): That's amazing
Georgia (Something Sensible): _holy smokes batman_ i had 18 people unfollow me in the last two days
Georgia (Something Sensible): is that the new instagram algorithm at work to clear out spam accounts?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have that daily XD
Probably accounts that followed expecting you to follow back and then ufollow you but you don‚Äôt follow them so they get angry XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have an app checker and like 11 of them were deleted users tho so idk
Evie (Katheryne Knight): O o f
Mark (Mad Doctor): It just dawned on me: Ozpin is Oscar's Squip
