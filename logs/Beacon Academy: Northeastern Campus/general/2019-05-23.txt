Mark (Mad Doctor): Today was the day Andrew Barrer, writer of Ant Man and the Wasp, came to talk with my nerd club. He dropped some interesting bits, like Thanos' snap and the time travel device had been planned ten years in advance, and that Luus' character had been rewritten on the fly as a motormouth because the two of them  got drunk the night before. Michael Pena couldn't remember his lines while hung over, so he just riffed.
Georgia (Something Sensible): TEN YEARS?
Georgia (Something Sensible): dayum
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oh, and I may have wrangled a gig as a consultant on the next Russo brothers film. Fingers crossed...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): whaaaaat for real?
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: fgasdhfjgk;;jhgfds WHAT
Mark (Mad Doctor): Andrew asked me about a book on my shelf titled Wharram Percy. WP is a deserted medieval village that was excavated over the course of fifty years. I worked there in the summer of '89. Some of the skeletons in the church yard had been mutilated before burial, and that fact became the premise for a medieval zombie film. I showed Andrew some pictures from my excavation and mentioned that I would be going there next month as I returned to my old stomping grounds. In Exchange for location shots, he offered to bring me to the set when they started shooting
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>  OMG THATS SO COOL
Mark (Mad Doctor): We talked cosplay. Showed him the BNE photo on my wall. He promised to check out RWBY
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: if you cause a RWBY easter egg in the next movie imma cry
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Mark that is so cool!
Matt (mattmyers25): Yoo that is awesome
