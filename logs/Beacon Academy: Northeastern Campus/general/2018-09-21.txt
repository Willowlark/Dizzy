Rebecca (madameterralupus): This isn't how I planned my night... crying over a fucking movie about dinosaurs 😩 😭 OOF
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Awwwww sweetie!!!
Erik (slendergiant): My sister got engaged tonight!
Jess (whoozica): Aww! Congratulations to her!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YAY!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww tell her congrats!! ❤ ❤
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): AWW congrats! That's adorable!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh yo so I got a new mouse
So I might be able to play league again if anyone wants to hit me up at some point. 

When I’m not working obviously XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Marisa (Weeb): One of my students today told me his dream was to go to NYC and visit a Barnes and Noble. He didn’t want to go to Times Square just a Barnes and noble.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly same?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like walking into a Barnes and Noble is like walking into heaven for me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did you mean Borders?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~petition to brinf back borders~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): please.
Jess (whoozica): ~~petition to bring back either within a reasonable distance from my house~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ valid
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I like Barnes and Noble more XD

But all we have is BAM where I live. I got to go to Chris’s to go to B&N
Marisa (Weeb): I told him about borders and that it died and he was kind of sad but happy that Barnes and noble exists
Bargain Book Warehouse is where it’s at tho
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thriftbooks.com for those who are cheap AF like me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oooh?
Erik (slendergiant): The B&N in Manhattan (not sure specifically because I'm sure there's several) is amazing because it's TWO FLOORS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i go to barnes and noble and pick out a bunch of books but then i go online and get them for like 75% off the B&N price 😂
Marisa (Weeb): I passed all my AP tests because bargain book warehouse just had just stacks of discount AP books 🙏 
Wow two whole floors. Just like Rowan. 
The one in Baltimore is like 6 floors or something isn’t it? It’s huge
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Manhattan has a japanese bookstore Kinokuniya.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Entire floor of just manga.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): have yall ever been to mitsuwa marketplace
Marisa (Weeb): Ironically kinokuniya is the only place here with English books
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because theres like a whole strip of japanese stores and japanese food court and restaurant and stuff o3o its pretty lit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): where that?
Jess (whoozica): our friends have been trying to get us to go there for like 2 years but still havnt managed to get ehre
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): edgewater nj
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its really fucking cool
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i love it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanna go.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BNE GROUP GATHERING
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😄
Marisa (Weeb): ~~I live near a few Japanese stores and restaurants come visit~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): just a few
Marisa (Weeb): At least one
Marisa (Weeb): I’d say maybe three
Marisa (Weeb): And the screaming tofu can
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): O_O screaming tofu van?
Marisa (Weeb): Traditionally tofu would be sold by bike peddlers and the tofu would be in a cooler on the back of the bike, and there’s a very distinctive horn/whistle that they blow to announce the tofu is driving by. This is that but a van and the horn whistle sound is automated and super loud. 

In winter there are trucks that shout at people to sell them their used kerosene containers, or scrap old metal items, or even trash trucks will yell “TURNING LEFT” in an automated voice when they’re gonna turn left
Marisa (Weeb): And during election season you have actual people with microphones yelling from their trucks and vans
Marisa (Weeb): TLDR I’m surprised there’s no anime yet about a girl who turns into a screaming truck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh dear, japan sure is strange
Evie (Katheryne Knight): See where I live it’s lame af we got one good sushi place and a couple of nice hibachi places and that’s it. I hate York XD
Jess (whoozica): our town doesn tallow alot of chains or big businesses, but the malls like 10 mins away so das coo
Jess (whoozica): we have one strip mall with 3 coffee places?
Marisa (Weeb): my friend made me stand in line for a famous sushi place for an hour and a half and it kind of sucked. way too much wasabi in my opinion. but the cheap $1/plate basement sushi places are fantastic when you're half dead from cosplaying
Marisa (Weeb): i need anime/manga/comic recommendations pls i'm dying
Marisa (Weeb): anyone with a good series shall be rewarded handsomely by deciding what i should doodle in class next week. suggestions for that are open too
Marisa (Weeb): pwease
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I would suggest something but I can imagine everything I'd suggest you have already read or seen 😂
Jess (whoozica): marisa knows all
Jess (whoozica): ~~have you*read ava's demon?~~
Marisa (Weeb): there are some i haven't seen like the monk anime that has three different versions that range from family friend to straight up hentai

Marisa (Weeb): i could reread that and catch up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye, I've been out of the game long enough I won't try.
