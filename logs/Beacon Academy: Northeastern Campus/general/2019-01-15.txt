Anna (Cadmium): qrow makeup is like. put makeup on. rub eyes. wipe until you look like 2008 brendon urie
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not gonna lie, its a good look
Anna (Cadmium): i read way too much of this 'qrow was in an emo band' fic and like. cant unsee
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Was his band name "The Black Qrows" or "Counting Qrows"?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sheryl Qrow
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It would be great if Chris actually S T A Y E D S T I L L
Evie (Katheryne Knight): he's super twitchy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): VERY twitchy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Doing Roman make up on him was a nightmare
Anna (Cadmium): how did you even manage that
Anna (Cadmium): esp bc roman has that one random lower eyelash a la clockwork orange
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I strattled him while he was on a chair and we did it one stroke at a time
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Out of context that message sounds lewd
Dizzy: https://68.media.tumblr.com/c292dc288ec9bedb4fb7f2528c410a41/tumblr_ootvlcfBh31twgfw0o2_540.gif
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): !lewd
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I gave him a fidget cube fir his ADHD specifically so he has something to distract him so he doesn't go into panic mode
Evie (Katheryne Knight): GOOD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He hates his eyes being touched but he lets me do it cause he trusts me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fidget cubes are neato
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I recently got one and it helps me stay awake during night drives
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OOF
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean thats good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but yike
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It's actually a really good way to keep your brain awake and occupied 

It helps Chris focus
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe i should use mine
Anna (Cadmium): interesting. 
is he just bad at doing makeup himself and thats why you do it or is it like he doesnt like touching his own face either?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He can't do make up on himself
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He only does it does it for cosolay
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He lets me wax his eyebrows too XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): My sympathies to Chris. I hate having anything near my eyes. One more reason I've never worn contacts
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He also does hatw touching his face. He can't even get water in his eyes it bothers him that much. It makes him panicked
Anna (Cadmium): It does take hella getting used to 
Aw my sympathies to him thats gotta be hard
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It is
But we have a system which is how we can pull it off
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i couldnt do eyeliner for an embarrassign amount of time because i didnt like things near my eyes either so i feel that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I suck at eyeliner 
It doesn't help I don't wear makeup on a daily basis cause I'm lazy so I don't practice
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed. When I was younger I hated doing "play" makeup cause I didn't liek anything near my eyes. I twitched so much with eyeshadow and flipped out with eyeliner. I am slowly getting better at it lol
And lol a big mood Evie. I don't wear it on a daily basis either
Anna (Cadmium): ~~my obsession before cosplay was makeup so if yall ever need help~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm getting better at eyeliner. I can do my left eye pretty good because I'm let-handed, but doing my right is still a bit of a struggle
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we should have makeup workshops with anna
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): xD
Anna (Cadmium): i have an embarrassingly large quantity of makeup
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wig workshops with me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): prop with all the prop bros
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): worbla with meg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I struggle with eyeliner soemtimes depending where I am doing ti cause it I am too far away from the mirror I can't fucking see to do it some soemtimes it comes out wonky XD
Anna (Cadmium): <@!386874959009415170>  do your right eye first and then just match your left eye to the right eye
Anna (Cadmium): *cracks knuckles* leggo
Erik (Red Riot Thot): you right
Anna (Cadmium): are you using like pencil eyeliner or liquid or gel or
Anna (Cadmium): i wasnt kidding ~~i have an excel sheet of my makeup and its all priced at replacement cost and i like am actually embarassed at the total~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): liquid?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it's the kind that's like a makeup sharpie lol
Anna (Cadmium): ok so u use a felt tip eyeliner 
if you arent doing winged eyeliner or looking for sharp points i would actually suggest switching to pencil
Georgia (Something Sensible): liquid
Georgia (Something Sensible): mmm wings are the best tho
Anna (Cadmium): wings big enough to fly away from ur problems
Anna (Cadmium): but anyways i hate those cause if u have oily eyelids your eyeliner migrates
Anna (Cadmium): i am the makeup fairy
Anna (Cadmium): let me help yall
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i was sephora rouge last year~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I do sharper points
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I used to use pencil
Erik (Red Riot Thot): this other one is much easier to work with
Anna (Cadmium): feels on that
Anna (Cadmium): pencil you gotta keep sharp to get a point but you wanna use pencil or gel pencil for your waterline for the ultimate emo effect
Anna (Cadmium): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m_zoaqQ6WA
Anna (Cadmium): ~~this one is actually good~~
Marisa (Mawisa): if u mess up on your eyeliner just make it bigger. keep making it bigger.
