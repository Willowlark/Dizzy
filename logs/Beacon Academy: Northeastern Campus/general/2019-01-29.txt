Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YAAAASS it was a great idea that looks good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thanks!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's my favorite jacket and I've had it since high school
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Initially wanted to stitch it on in case I ever wanted to remove it, but the adhesive was thick and I had trouble getting a needle through so I gave up and committed to ironing it on lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It looks cool! üò∏

Mark (Mad Doctor): Thought wall at my school had a fun prompt this week

Anna (loud and likely blonde): "no thanks"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): heh. this architect firm is called Butz-Wilburn
Anna (loud and likely blonde): AHAHAHAHH i think i convinced troy to move in with me when my lease is up
Anna (loud and likely blonde): our apartment will be a cosplay chaos 24/7
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): my roommate is going to the Philippines for a week, perfect time for me to bleach and dye my hair like ruby's without anyone bitching that the bleach is stinking up the apartment
Georgia (Something Sensible): _I caught Noah watching a convention panel video, he‚Äôs caught the weeb_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Marisa (Mawisa): Busted
It‚Äôs time for ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù with him
Marisa (Mawisa): ‚ÄúYou see, when a transfer student leaves their home late with bread in their mouth and runs into their mysterious senpai under the falling cherry blossoms...‚Äù
Marisa (Mawisa): That‚Äôs when the demon mecha appears
Jess (whoozica): OMF XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): He‚Äôs watching Harry Potter videos
Georgia (Something Sensible): _he asked me how the wizard economy worked this morning_
Marisa (Mawisa): Oh then you have to give the talk in a british accent
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tru I will do that
Mark (Mad Doctor): https://media.tenor.com/images/20db0fb2599adda8b70d86932abbdc32/tenor.gif
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Be sure to explain the wizard poop thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): NO NOT THE POO
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: The wizard economy works the same way as any normal economy?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Why would it be any different
Marisa (Mawisa): Wizard money
Anna (loud and likely blonde): to anyone who actually likes math and ever studied economics none of it makes sense
Anna (loud and likely blonde): are there taxes
why is your money the worst math ever
Anna (loud and likely blonde): do you have farmers
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: They definitely have taxes, they have government
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you obviously have manufacturing but how and why
Anna (loud and likely blonde): where do you get fabric from. are your manufacturers muggles? how does that influence your economy
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: They also have wizarding world beasts they clearly care for
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I expect the wizarding world is basically just another country
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how does the ability to replenish and multiply stuff affect crop supply and demand
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: They dont have that ability to do it spontaneously tho
Anna (loud and likely blonde): no obviously they have to use a spell but
the wizarding world cannot function like a normal economy because finite resources arent exactly finite like that
Marisa (Mawisa): Mr. Weasley didn‚Äôt know how to use muggle money so presumably they have their own wizard Joann‚Äôs
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok but who makes that fabric
Marisa (Mawisa): Jo Ann hersel
Anna (loud and likely blonde): is the manufacturer buying from muggles
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Except they are 
Everything spell that seems to make finite resources infinite doesnt last or warps them
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: The wizarding world has never fully defied physics in a way that fundamentally breaks conservation of mass or energy
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but it still alters it. its not infinite but for that moment you can alter quantity
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i mean. 
it kinda does defy physics
Marisa (Mawisa): Squibs could be the go-between. No use for wizard money but living in a wizard world, so they‚Äôre the only ones it makes sense for to use both currency
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the middleman of materials
Marisa (Mawisa): Only the prime minister and muggles married to wizards really knows about wizards otherwise
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so squibs and muggleborn just. set the prices on everything
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: when has it been shown in the HPU that  resources are nonfinite tho
Marisa (Mawisa): Infinite water
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: do they have infinite water?
Marisa (Mawisa): Aguamenti
Anna (loud and likely blonde): cant they also like multiply items
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: it launches a water stream, but a wizard can't cast it endlessly 
logic suggests the water comes from somewhere, most likely condensation
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they can appear to multiply items
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: it makes fakes that eventually disappear
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but if you can summon it out of condensation you can still 'create' it moreso than a human can distill it.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yes but thats a matter of efficiency
Marisa (Mawisa): Are you sure it can‚Äôt be cast endlessly
Go find someone to cast it as long as they can and also ask them how their economy works
Anna (loud and likely blonde): also like yeah in theory it pulls it out of condensation to our brains. but. is it really cause JK rowling leaves many holes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u can just. temporarily animate things also
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how does your economy work if there is next to no infrastructure
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how do you maintain the little infrastructure you HAVE
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they have a giant government
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: that has permits for stores and everything
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and monitors transportation
Marisa (Mawisa): So canonically you can‚Äôt create something from nothing but you can multiply it once it does exist
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: remember how the Ministry has the ability to watch the ENTIRE floo network
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so you can increase quantity once youve got some
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: or whatever the fireplace thing
Marisa (Mawisa): Food can also be enlarged
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah but like. when you're mooching off the muggle transportation infrastructure how does that work
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its implied the ministries are connected to muggle governments tho
Marisa (Mawisa): In the same way that the US and Russian governments are connected ;3c
Anna (loud and likely blonde): exactly so how does your government and economy work when you kinda shadow in a different worlds governments
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: also they don't need muggle transportation for the most part
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah 9 3/4 is probably an independently owned wizard rail company
Anna (loud and likely blonde): they dont need it but they do use part of its infrastructure
knight bus uses roads, you still have a pocket dimension out of a british rail station, you still have to get to kings cross station
Marisa (Mawisa): were the roads originally muggle roads or wizard roads? ü§î
Anna (loud and likely blonde): whoever is there first but most likely footpaths and carriage trails dating back to the 12c
Marisa (Mawisa): muggles and wizards cooperated together until around 100ce
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so not very much
Marisa (Mawisa): the secret stuff and separation began around 1700
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk when london paved its roads but wouldve been cobbles
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so like. you still got two economies and governments that are only partially separated
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so how does that really work
Anna (loud and likely blonde): is a valid question
Anna (loud and likely blonde): whats considered each
Anna (loud and likely blonde): what are jobs like
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i guess plumbing came around way after
Anna (loud and likely blonde): are there wizard plumbers now though? HVAC? i assume theres farriers but is there really only one sport? how do people pay property tax if you can hide. how does legal ownership of land work
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~this is why i cant write stories cause i spend 90% of my time on the logic of worldbuilding~~
Marisa (Mawisa): owls might be able to track a person down unless they know enough complex magic to truly hide themselves well. like how voldemort was able to track harry just by the words he used.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i feel wizard tax evasion would be easy though.
Marisa (Mawisa): i feel like a lot of wizards are kind of red necky and just do whatever they want
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *how do you run an economy of rednecks even Louisiana has enough functioning people to have a government*
Marisa (Mawisa): time for an experiment lets find out
everybody go find some rednecks
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *hello*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): jk im actually not but compared to the ppl over here and what they assume redneck is, i am
Anna (loud and likely blonde): side note
Anna (loud and likely blonde): what did i just find
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): this is worse than the dobby/spock smut fic my roommate found that had multiple installments
Marisa (Mawisa): nah it's only 87 words. it's art.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): https://archiveofourown.org/works/12094941
Anna (loud and likely blonde): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FUyGT_kYLw&feature=youtu.be is the link. it gives
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i have stumbled upon the greatest art of our generation
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: hmmm
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how am i allowed on the internet
Marisa (Mawisa): i like their plates
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah honestly for a shitpost its pretty impressive
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Wait did i miss an entire season of bnha
Anna (loud and likely blonde): fuck it im reading it instead
Anna (loud and likely blonde): did i not watch season 3? or does hulu have the wrong opening on the dub
Marisa (Mawisa): i did that once. started reading something, forgot where i was, started a spin-off and suddenly the child main character is an adult with two wives
Marisa (Mawisa): i had season 3 subbed on the other day how did it start I can tell u if it's right or not
Anna (loud and likely blonde): dis song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GB7rZfjrxw
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the season with Stain
Marisa (Mawisa): the first episode is a bit of a recap episode but it does have the new opening
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's season 2
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah but hulu listed it as season 3 with eps with this opening
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im. confused
Anna (loud and likely blonde): w/e imma just read instead
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ill get through what equates to a season in a day of reading
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~to be fair its also not my hulu account~~
Marisa (Mawisa): la brava my love she is the best
i hope someone cosplays la brava at katsu
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~its troys hulu lemme aloneeee she borrows my netflix~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i cannae wait to finally meet u at katsu my shitposting friend
Marisa (Mawisa): i won't get offended if you scream and run that's quite natural
Marisa (Mawisa): must be part of my natural musk
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh no i am. excite.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i also have a terrible sense of smell unless it is danger
Anna (loud and likely blonde): then i can smell that quite easily
Marisa (Mawisa): danger smell
Anna (loud and likely blonde): not danger itself. but unless you smell like an explosive or a car fluid
Anna (loud and likely blonde): or rotting flesh
Anna (loud and likely blonde): which i hope you dont when i meet u
Anna (loud and likely blonde): listen. gas leaks are serious
Anna (loud and likely blonde): burning oil or rubber is also bad
Marisa (Mawisa): i started thinking of cosplay and now that's all i can think about i'll probably smell like cosplay (~~blood and tears and glue~~)
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh no those are fine smells
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the smell of cosplay suffering is the smell of potential friendship
Marisa (Mawisa): smell roulette, i have a different scent every time ranging from earthworm to wasabi and you have to guess it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): hairspray can easily be mistaken for vodka
Kurtis (Beardedelf94):
