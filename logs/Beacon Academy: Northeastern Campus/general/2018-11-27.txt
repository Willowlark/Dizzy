snow ( karma chameleon ): GOALS
Marisa (Weeb): THE ARTEMIS FOWL TRAILER IS OUT
Marisa (Weeb): AFTER ***AGES***
Erik (Red Riot Thot): YESSS
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like they talked about making a movie for like, the past decade
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need to reread and finish that series
Marisa (Weeb): yeah!!! one has been in works since 2003/2006 but there's been issues with the copyright and stuff until disney finally got a hold of it in 2013 and last year they put out a casting call and now *look how far we've come*
Marisa (Weeb): i went through the trailer frame by frame because i'm desperate like that.
*is that mulch with an iris-cam on*
Marisa (Weeb): my coworkers and i all re-read the books a few months ago
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't think I got past book 3
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I bought books 4 and 5 but never got around to reading them
Marisa (Weeb): ooo. i couldn't finish the final book when i re-read it earlier this year. it does kind of decline towards the end but the last is the worst in my opinion. there's even a love interest for artemis that the author admitted he totally forgot about and that's why she isn't in any of the following books lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): RIP
Marisa (Weeb): they are making some major changes to the story that fans aren't happy about. i'm just thrilled for now and if it's a horrifying disappointment i'll deal with that when i'm heartbroken in the theater
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think that sets it up for being one of the film adaptations that never gets a sequel...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): have you ever read any of Eoin Colfer's other stuff?
Marisa (Weeb): just his final book for the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have yet to read that one
Marisa (Weeb): i'm so glad they kept artemis young though

Erik (Red Riot Thot): But I really liked *The Wish List* and *The Supernaturalist*
Marisa (Weeb): are you a percy jackson fan? i've been meaning to reread those too
Marisa (Weeb): barnes and noble sells a giant book that's a compilation of all the hitchhiker's guide books in one novel for like $20
Marisa (Weeb): one of their fancy gold leaf ones
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I WANT IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS V NICE
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I bought the Wizard of Oz B&N compilation so I could do RWBY research lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I never got around to the Percy Jackson series
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I heard the books were good but the movies were trash
Marisa (Weeb): yeah the movies are absolute garbage
i have a ton of fairy tale books from B&N they work great for cosplay and also i'm fairy tale trash
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just need all of those B&N hardbacks because they're all gorgeous (and actually v cheap?) but like, when I have my own place I want a bookshelf to just fill with them because they look so nice lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): they've got the Star Wars book adaptations and some Doctor Who novels and ugh they are just so pretty
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't even read that much anymore but I want them
Marisa (Weeb): give us artemis fowl fancy book
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@!184437198865563648> I was tempted to finally get the Echo/Amazon Fire stick off Amazon and was ready to check out, but it said the Fire Stick wouldn't be delivered until like a week and a half from now and then I remembered I can buy it at Best Buy for the same price and just get it in store üòÇ

Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lowkey, Spongebob was such a strangely integral part of my childhood and college life so this is v upsetting
Jess (whoozica): yea, seriously though
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I always had a love hate relationship with Spongebob i don't really know why, like I'd go through phases of loving it then disliking it... but recently I enjoy it and oof yea that's sad he passed.
