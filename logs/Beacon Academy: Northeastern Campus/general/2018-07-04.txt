Monica (absolutezerocosplay): It was very lit
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I love dinosaurs
Erik (slendergiant): Went to go to our town's 4th of July parade. Gave up ater 15 minutes of looking for parking 😑
Erik (slendergiant): For a parade that only lasts about 35 minutes and really isn't all that great anymore, it's surprisingly well attended
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ooof
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's a bit ridiculous
Mark (Mad Doctor): Our parade starts at 4 and goes for two hours. People already have their lawn chairs out. This is our first year attending. Not sure what to expect
snow ( crescentbladed ): _happy 4th of july friends_
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Happy 4th!
Trying to get as much done on Pyrrha as possible
snow ( crescentbladed ): ayy u got this 😄
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have a major headache and I’m kinda dying but I figured I’d feel better if I do it!

Thank you!! I’m trying! I wish I had my foam so I could work on her neck piece too
snow ( crescentbladed ): D: just dont overwork yourself if your headache gets worse
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ill try not too! Trying to take advantage of this day off ^_^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Listening to the Pyrrha/Arkos based songs while I craft >u<
snow ( crescentbladed ): I can’t afford anything new for rtx so I’m tempted to go as summer rose all three days XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly if I can't get Pyrrha done I'm probably going to do Winter all 3 days.
snow ( crescentbladed ): THATS A MOOD
snow ( crescentbladed ): I found a photographer for Friday x_X finally
Evie (Katheryne Knight): nice!
snow ( crescentbladed ): the struggle was real
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I believe it. XD
Idk if I'm even gonna bother with private shoots at RTX 
I'm probably just gonna go around and explore. 
In heels...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *You're going to be wishing you brought winter with you tbh*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh I'm bringing Winter no matter what XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (lower case winter) 😼
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If I don't get pyrrha done I'll just be wearing her every day
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If I get Pyrrha done I'll have her for Saturday.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (You'll wish it was cold)
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (winter)
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm only wearing Pyrrha one day because that armor is gonna be uncomfortable as hell.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): All reports corroborate that.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Despite the heels, Winter is fairly comfortable
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It's literally just those damn shoes XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And I'm too lazy to take the boot covers off and place them onto new ones.
snow ( crescentbladed ): Ahhh I wish ur feet luck XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I survived Katsu
I'll hpefully survive RTX
snow ( crescentbladed ): YOU WILL
snow ( crescentbladed ): hopefully I survive too bc wheelchair rentals are 140 dollars or more for the weekend RIP
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'll have to bathe in the tib for hours to prep my feets for the next day. 

Oof...
snow ( crescentbladed ): u got this girl
Evie (Katheryne Knight): As long as I get to be my Ice Queen I'm happy ^_^
snow ( crescentbladed ): If need be just rest ur feet and sit
Evie (Katheryne Knight): After wearing heels for a whole con sometimes that doesn't do it. 
AFter a while I have to take super frequent breaks because the pain gets that bad.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like by Sunday of Katsu I was limping to the car.
snow ( crescentbladed ): ThAT ISNT GOOD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Started getting a crap ton of blisters on the bottom of my feet
snow ( crescentbladed ): GORL
Evie (Katheryne Knight): and my feet ached in general

And Chris can't carry me because he's got Harbinger to worry about.
snow ( crescentbladed ): Would bandaids on ur feet help at all??
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Nope
It was that far gone
And I couldn't feel my toes for a week.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But I was Winter and that's all that mattered to me
snow ( crescentbladed ): The things we do for cosplay
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like everyone was yelling at me to take them off and I was like "NO THEN IT WILL LOOK WEIRD"
Erik (slendergiant): That's a mood
