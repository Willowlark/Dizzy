Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah , I've been trusting it, I kinda like it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye, my feed isn't long enough that I couldn't keep track of new additions, so I'm pretty sure the checkmark isn't a trick.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~unless Insta is completely hiding things~~

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I only watched like halfway and was like ummm..
And oh god...I feel I should be concerned with that one XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have no idea why Katsu's Friday album is getting hits in July, but more importantly Tom and Jess are basically the highest viewed album in the last 28 days.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nice you weebs.
Jess (whoozica): 😮
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think google analytics is smart enough to recognize same computer connections too, so that’d be 36 different viewers. Or close to it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I have no idea how to read google analytics ~~
Marisa (Weeb): does it tell you what country the clicks originate from
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yeah.

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "did you win?" "no grandma, i just hung out with friends. it was fun." "oh, did they win?"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I literally made a photo album for her of all my costumes so she can show her friends easily since she enjoyed doing that. So whenever we visit, I update it with anything new XDD

<@184437198865563648> , would you like me to ask the author to credit your photo? She provided a link, but it seems like the proper thing to do.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): if you'd like to I certainly wouldn't mind, though only if you're comfortable with it. No need to wake waves for my account. *(Ha, puns)*
Jess (whoozica): thats so cool!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Indeed, how many Cool Dads ™ are out there in con land? Mark's a good catch for an article like this.
Jess (whoozica): yea def! that's awesome Mark!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hear that, <@382689138450890752> ? I'm a Cool Dad ™
Mark (Mad Doctor): She'll try to get her editor to add photo credit
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ayyy that article was written by someone from my college sweet
