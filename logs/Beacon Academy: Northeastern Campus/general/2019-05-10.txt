Jamie (Jamie): So if I had access to the clothes to do so apparently i would be a major mori girl according to this. *stares at all the vintage books, bottles and other crap I collect because its aged and old*
Jamie (Jamie): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh that's cute üòÆ
Jamie (Jamie): I would dress in that style 100% of time if i had more clothes that could pull it off
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh there's a lot of styles I'd love to do and wear all the time but I'm too lazy and broke to do so... so I just resort to jeans and graphic tees xD
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): Mori girl clothes are so expensive üò≠ good luck finding anything under $60
Jamie (Jamie): Yeaa but also thats what thrift stored are for. Granted skirts of more than one layer with actual volume are so costly regardless
