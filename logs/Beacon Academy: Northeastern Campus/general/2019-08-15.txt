Monica (absolutezerocosplay): lord he is super riled up XD I don't usually allow myself to get into things like this but this is too good
Mark (Mad Doctor): And, you know, I do feel like I've reached peak adulthood. 😀
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): no he seems to be the most mature of all of us, since he obviously knows better than all of us
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he's a cosplay expert™
Mark (Mad Doctor): And he'll continue to remind us of that fact until his mommy tells him it's bedtime
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I just noticed he's following Audrey's rwby fan account 🤔
Mark (Mad Doctor): She hasn't updated that in ages
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: I can't even see the comments on Erik's post
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Ultimately, people like that cannot be reasoned with, and it really sucks
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Did you report the guy?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): If you did I'm pretty sure it automatically blocks them and then I don't think you can see their content
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao this kids just a fucking punk who needs to learn the phrase "if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all".Like he's digging his own grave arguing over literally nothing... like... what
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Fdhhfjfhfh Lana fucking coming in with 'youre a meme account nothing you say matters'
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: I love her
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Ikr XD
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: She's excellent I love her 
One day I'll see her at a con. You know. When I make it to Australia 💀
Mark (Mad Doctor): OK, I'm almost done with him. The only cosplay accounts he follows are lewds. I hate to make generalizations, but I suspect he's so angry because we're eating into his Fortnite time.
Mark (Mad Doctor): He deleted his angry thread because I pointed out what Erik mentioned in his story. He came back with a more civil troll 😂😂😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Pffft what a coward
Mark (Mad Doctor): Anyhow, I just wanted to say I thought the post was hysterical
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: ONE OF THE NEW GUYS AT WORK LOVES RWBY
