Erik (Red Riot Thot): Neat! I'd be getting Starbucks points as well as Amazon points <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Jess (whoozica): Do you guys read messages from people in their voice?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Now that you mention it, I read them in my own voice
Georgia (Something Sensible): Weirdddd
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ok but take a sexond to think
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Is it actually your own voice
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Does it actually sound like you 
Or is it a different voice altogether that is pretty much only in your  brain
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, so the thing about Chase cards got me thinking about my own and how I forget that I get Amazon rewards points for my purchases with it. I typically only use it for ordering things online and most of my in-store purchases are on my debit card. I typically prefer using my debit because it just deducts from my account automatically and I don't have to worry about a high(er) credit card bill. I just went through all my debit purchases for the past month and calculated that had I used my credit card for those purchases instead, I would have gotten about $9.85 back in Amazon rewards. So I want to experiment for this coming month using my credit card instead when I purchase in store.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): yup. I started with Amazon rewards. I still use the prime card for amazon purchases but use my sapphire reserve for everything else.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Why not make money on all the things I buy?
Jess (whoozica): using your credit card is great for getting points , if you pay it off in the same month you wont accrue interest so its like free money! just don't spend more than you can pay off at any given time
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ^
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Both of those are the keys.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Just treat your credit card as if it was a debit card; never spend more than you already had.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Assuming you don't make a habit of overdrafting, you'll never notice the difference.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's why I typically use my debit because it automatically deducts from my account and I don't have to worry about a super high bill. Like, if my debit purchases were with my credit card, it would have added like another $1000 onto my bill and anytime my bill is over $1000 I cringe lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It also means my bank account will look higher ~~until I pay of the bill~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yup.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Use Mint.com.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): They aggregate your financial accounts, so you can use that to see what your situtation really looks like.
Jess (whoozica): understandable, i get freaked out at high credit card balances too but the free moneys worth the little but more organization it takes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I use Prism to keep track of my accounts
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Personal favorite is the net income trends you can have it generate, which is how I watch to know if I spend too much in a month.
Georgia (Something Sensible): THERES A FRAT GUY IN THE DINING HALL DRESSED AS NARUTO
Georgia (Something Sensible): WHAT A DAY
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone also asked for my picture so now there‚Äôs a picture of me holding pasta dressed as Ramona on a strangers phone
Jess (whoozica): amazing
Georgia (Something Sensible): I found a Goku too
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): My boss gave me the om
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ok
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): The physics department actually has this on display.... it‚Äôs a 14 year old Twinkie
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That Twinkie lookin' like a *S N A C C* üòè
Jess (whoozica): Omg üòÇ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I got my sewing machine and my mom yelled at me because she had another one I could have had (that her mom got her when my parents got married)
Jess (whoozica): Oh nooo! üò≠
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Honestly, I'd rather have the newer one
Jess (whoozica): Mmmm true
Georgia (Something Sensible): I find sewing machines tend to be like cars, you can drive any car but you‚Äôre most comfortable using your own
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Then my dad goes "Next tine you make a big purchase, ask us because we might have it already" and I was like "It wasn't terribly expensive." "What did you pay, like 300 bucks?" "Uuh, no... 80..."
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Damn day Twinkie. Mmph.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestly I thought the Twinkie was like a couple days old
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nah that shit 14 years old
Georgia (Something Sensible): It‚Äôs older than most human children
ZombieHunter: Casey is bullying me.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Did you deserve it
Mark (Mad Doctor): I left a Twinkie on the windowsill right before I took my junior year abroad. It was still in perfect condition when I returned
