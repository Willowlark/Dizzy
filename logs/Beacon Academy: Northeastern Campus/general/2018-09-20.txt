Evie (Katheryne Knight): D a m n
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the accoustic version of Gold is so fucking good. like how the hell does caseys voice do **that**
Erik (slendergiant): So since I have no clue what I'm doing at the gym, I did some research and stumbled across Nerd Fitness and holy shit was this designed for people like us
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s where Jess and Georgia got the waifu material shirts.
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Erik (slendergiant): ~~you can add another impulse purchase because I joined~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you have to pay for it?
Dizzy: The erik-impulse-buys count is now 8!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): !counter erik-impulse-buys add 1
Jess (whoozica): ye its like a subscription thingy with videos right erik?
Jess (whoozica): i've looked into it before, let me know how you like it!
Erik (slendergiant): For full access to the training program, yes
Erik (slendergiant): It
Erik (slendergiant): It was $150
Jess (whoozica): one time or monthly?
Jess (whoozica): oh opps u just said that rip
Jess (whoozica): thats not bad!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Depending on how much gets updated, ye.
Erik (slendergiant): But like, it has a DnD type vibe to it in that you create a character and it has different exercises based on your skill level and then if you can defeat the "boss battle" you level up
Erik (slendergiant): So like, *very much* designed for us nerd that have no idea what we're doing
Erik (slendergiant): And you can select body weight exercises that you can do at home or stuff at the gym if you have access to one
Jess (whoozica): dat neat
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh??
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh I need this
Erik (slendergiant): https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/
Erik (slendergiant): In case anyone wants to check it out. He goes through how everything works in the video
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): In a similar vein, you can use https://habitica.com/ to make anything into an rpg. You setup tasks, reminders, goals and earn gold when you do them, take damage when you miss deadlines.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've tried it a few times.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Doesn't work for me.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm this fitness program seems interesting 🤔 will have to check out the link when on comp. I need to get working out myself. I'm so out of shape and the doctor says it'd be good for me too sooo 🙃
Jamie (Jamie): Hey guys you should check out this awesome deal on a shirt design my coworker is selling. Its freaking glow in the dark AND a really nice shirt too like soft poly blend
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.etsy.com/listing/628045624/now-forever-limited-glow-print?ref=shop_home_feat_1
Jamie (Jamie): Also to more sound like an ad, use code "CSGOLDEN" and it should be 15% off 👌👌
Georgia (Something Sensible): Heard said about me by physics friends: “she looks really throwable. Like gimli from lord of the rings, you know?”

Tom (tomukuncosplay): **dwarf toss**
Erik (slendergiant): *"Don't tell the elf"*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): little does anybody know
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): but the original line that was going to be used for that seen
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): was actually "YEET"
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Omg that sweater is so cuteee
Erik (slendergiant): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): it was specifically, "this sides empty, YEET" as they were on the part of the area with no enemies
Erik (slendergiant): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): GOD BLESS YOU ERIK
Tom (tomukuncosplay): ❤
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Good things to do at work
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Perfection
Erik (slendergiant): I've done nothing productive all day. This is why I shouldn't be in charge of anything
Erik (slendergiant): *let alone a business*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you've done nothing because you are in charge~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): i'm downloading that and putting it on my story
Erik (slendergiant): Because "one of the few that has a degree" is qualification enough to be in charge
Erik (slendergiant): Do gifs work on stories?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): nope :c
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I tried
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you put it on giphy publicly, doesn't instagram gif stickers source from giphy?
Erik (slendergiant): I don't think so because Insta has a very limited selection of gifs
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it *is* Giphy, but yeah it looks like they installed some kind of filters.
Erik (slendergiant): I'm not sure how gifs get added but I remember RT announcing that they now had various RT and AH gifs available a while back
Erik (slendergiant): It's really only for larger businesses. You have to become a verified brand on giphy
Erik (slendergiant): speaking of gifs... Insta just announced gifs for DMs ***FINALLY***
Tom (tomukuncosplay): But can you see the ones you send
Tom (tomukuncosplay): And not just a play button
Erik (slendergiant): Not sure, my app hasn't actually been updated to it yet lol
Erik (slendergiant): but it looks like it won't be a play button
Erik (slendergiant): basically same as the gif feature in FB messenger
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You can post that on your story
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I screen recorded it so it’s a video
Erik (slendergiant): Bless you
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Today over yet?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i fucking wish
Jess (whoozica): ☝
Erik (slendergiant): 🙃
Mark (Mad Doctor): So at my school, sports teams often do themed costumes for Halloween (last year, girls' cross country went as trophies, boys' soccer went as lifeguards, the drama club went as Cards against Humanity and so on). This year, the Nerd Club is going as a squad for the first time. Let's just say that people will Marvel at the costumes we were able to Assemble...
Mark (Mad Doctor): #proudteacher
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That’s beautiful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://youtu.be/WYY7YM3E9aw
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I cant fucking breathe
Erik (slendergiant): I saw that. I was fucking crying
Erik (slendergiant): Goro is everything
