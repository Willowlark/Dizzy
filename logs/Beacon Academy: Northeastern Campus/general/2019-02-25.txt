Anna (loud and likely blonde): If anyone can find me a character I can wear the dress on the left again for... Lmk. It's been chilling in a closet for four years now and I can't bear to part with it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Blake
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Itd be a cute formal Blake dress
Anna (loud and likely blonde): True I should see if mag fits in the dress cause I altered it for prom.  I would need a wig ears and everything for blek  lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee Blake, Cinder, Raven.. uhh
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I need a black wig is what y'all are saying

Nope no black
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~literally all this is make mag wear the dress so I can tell her she looks hot~~
Matt (mattmyers25): Yang
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If you need a long-ish black wig I got one I was planning on getting rid of you can have 😮
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~it's not a couple account though~~ <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Listen she's the permanent front wheel of this tricycle
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 👀 👀 👀  may I. Snatch that wig
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes! I'll make a note to bring it when I see ya next~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Litty. U want my not incredibly destroyed yang wig as a trade ? 
*Convinces for more bees*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😮 If you don't want it or use it sure
Jamie (Jamie): Fuck human anatomy and more so any pose not front facing and upright. Fuck legs actually and this pose in particular
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Mood
Jamie (Jamie): *fold lines increasing*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Often what I do is try to take a picture of myself in the pose I want to draw and use it as reference
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Me: misses the first 2 weeks of classes due to Illness and snow days and work
Me: still has an 100% due to only 1 assignment needed so far and getting 100 on it despite have literally 0 idea what's going on in the class
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: By the power of Bullshit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hell yeaa boiii
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Best part: my profile photo for canvas (where the teacher grades and sees my submitted assignments)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Is a cosplay photo
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Of ozpin
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good lol
Marisa (Mawisa): jamie are u makin time chronicles spicy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I should change my school account profile photo to a cosplay one XD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: _This man will have no idea who I am when I walk in and sit down in his class tomorrow_
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Best part
Rebecca (madameterralupus): "Heeyy you're hairs shorter and not grey! Am I going crazy?" XDD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I apparently have had the class time wrong this entire time
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: So I was gonna go to class at 4:50
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: But it starts around 3 and would have been over when I arrived
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof. Good thing ya figured it out before that happened 😮
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Yeah lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: But like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I should not be doing well in this class right now xD
Georgia (Something Sensible): What class? More public policy?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Nonprofit administration
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Its UAPP330?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: So ye more public policy
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ye Rutgers just has a general public policy course and a European public policy
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: You only have two classes covering public policy
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah based on what’s available next fall at least
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m taking the European class to knock out a Poli Sci AND Rutgers requirement
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: That's so sad
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: This is why poli sci is so useless imho
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Learn all about the politics but can you actually do anything
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Like
Georgia (Something Sensible): Update: Rutgers doesn’t have a public policy major either
Georgia (Something Sensible): I just checked
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Yeah public policy isnt q common major
Georgia (Something Sensible): And yeah lmao that’s why Physics and Poli sci covers me
Jamie (Jamie): <@301927856240459777> i mean there is real world 2 years worth of material for this comic and it has new generations later on so spicey eventually ~~but not currently~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: But still you should have more public policy related classes in the polisci major
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: If not it's like going and learning all about cooking
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And how your food tastes
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: But not knowing about the recipes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah statistically speaking Rutgers hands out 2400 Poli sci degrees a year
Georgia (Something Sensible): Compared to the 120
Georgia (Something Sensible): My sociology class said that a lot of party kids take Poli sci majors to coast in classes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Rutgers isn’t a party school but any big state school has a culture for it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Yeah polisci highkey is a "lazy major"
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Not as bad as leadership but still
Georgia (Something Sensible): _rutgers has an interior decorating major_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Low key I've always wanted to do interior design...~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I respect interior decorating but there’s no way you need 4 years at 26K a year to get a degree in it
Georgia (Something Sensible): Especially cause they’ll make you take math classes on top of it anyways
Georgia (Something Sensible): 9% of Poli sci grads are unemployed after college
Georgia (Something Sensible): OOF
Georgia (Something Sensible): Physics is 4% by comparison
Marisa (Mawisa): both of my undergrad majors also have a 9.9% unemployment rate <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> we can start our own business
Marisa (Mawisa): idk what it's in yet but with all our combined expertise it'll be somethin
Georgia (Something Sensible): you can combine a lot of things
Georgia (Something Sensible): steve jobs said "apple lies at the crossroads of technology and the humanities"
Jamie (Jamie): ~~and People wonder why I've decided to say fuck it and not bother with college for my interests at this point~~ 🙃 🙃 🙃
Jamie (Jamie): Other hand i think i made this pose passable
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Does anyone know if being a business account affects your reach? Because I switched to a business account (again) so I could see my insights but I feel like my post today isn't getting as much activity. The last time I had it set to business I experienced something similar, hence why I switched back to a personal
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): iirc it does.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lame
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): apparently it does?? but my last post got like over 700 likes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so im just really confused
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i changed back to business like right before posting it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 100% because bees.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the algorithm is just really fucked
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wishes selfies got over 1.5k likes during katsu
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Maybe they cut your reach in an effort to get you to pay to promote your posts
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and she has like 800 followers
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so like doesnt compute
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i found twitter has like astronomically better reach~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~can you call random assignment an algorithm~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i hate twitter
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mood.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sammmeee. I've been trying to use Twitter more but I've never really liked it. Also the lay out is so all over for me. I don't see half the people I follows posts. Just their likes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaaa... its a giant clusterfuck of posts
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its super unorganized
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): retweets are annoying as hell.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not a fan
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but also... the rEAAAACH
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Alright guys, time to use Vero*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~fuck Vero~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol Vero was... something
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't really get a lot of action on my Twitter posts except for the few cosplay people who follow me. Maybe I'm just not using the right tags? I just feel like you can't do as much with Twitter because of the character limit and I don't want to flood the post with tags
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont even use tags tbh
Marisa (Mawisa): i get a good amount of interaction on twitter from japanese friends wanting to practice their english
tags seem to help very little
Erik (Red Riot Thot): like, my best post so far was the stupid Country Roads tweet lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~marisa whats your twitter~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol twitter share thread, leggo~
Marisa (Mawisa): @Mars0u0

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Nuuu don't leave us for Florida 😭
Jess (whoozica): mood
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~florida is where all the bad exes go, don't go there~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Lmao Leanna's right. XD~~
Jess (whoozica): they tried to sell us that school all the time when i was in high school/ community
Jamie (Jamie): but...full sail man its full sail. the one school i would go into debt for. and I mean I was accepted twice to go but never able to figure out a financial path to make it happen
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😭 do the online classes if you do so you don't have to leave usss
Jess (whoozica): big mood
Jamie (Jamie): fuck me up i looked at the graduate film, the reg one is still 80k  though that online one is 53k so online cheaper
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yeee. See?? 😛
Jamie (Jamie): lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~full sail is a for profit school be careful~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i know a guy who went there for audio production and hes got mad jobs but also works himself to death bc he went hella in debt
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <:BOI:549661223868694545>

Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's my fave even tho it dark xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im shook

Rebecca (madameterralupus): LOL
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm trying not to laugh out loud in class... omg

Kurtis (Beardedelf94): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is that marisa
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So the office manager/HR person ordered us some nice ball point pens, pads, and notebooks for our desks.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I code, I never really need a notebook.
Marisa (Mawisa): NO I RECOGNIZE THAT ART STYLE NONO
Marisa (Mawisa): i wish not to be in that author's manga
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *But now I'm doodling like it's 2008 and lamenting despite years of effort I never learned to draw better than stick figures*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): which is it?
Marisa (Mawisa): that picture is from mononoke sharing
same author as chichi chichi
don't look them up at work
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Apparently Kurto is a lewd boi.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): +1 fear
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I guess that's a third date kinda manga*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i looked it up~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): anime was a mistake
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): anime was ALWAYS a mistake.
Marisa (Mawisa): it starts out all normal and innocent
||and then several chapters in the oversized breast fetish begins en masse and it becomes a horror manga||
Marisa (Mawisa): both of them 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): +2 FEAR
Marisa (Mawisa): here a good manga rec though <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what is
Marisa (Mawisa): Kusuriya no Hitorigoto
one of my top 5
the novel is so good it has 2 manga being published in exactly the same way at the exact same time in two different magazines by two different artists. ~~one is far superior to the other though the art suits it much better~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): bakamanga on Chichi: "Borderline H" "Bukkake"

*I don't think that's borderline anymore*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😬
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@!301927856240459777> can i read it online? 😮
Marisa (Mawisa): maomao will cure us all
Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH!!!
Marisa (Mawisa): i got really confused in japan though because i bought a volume of it and the art was so different i was like ????
Marisa (Mawisa): but the plot and story and characters and literally everything was the same
Marisa (Mawisa): just the art
Marisa (Mawisa): was this
Marisa (Mawisa): instead of this
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats really strange that they are doing two separate versions
Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH why they do that
Marisa (Mawisa): you can read it here
https://mangakakalot.com/manga/kusuriya_no_hitorigoto
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~so it's historical Shirayuki Hime~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THANK
Marisa (Mawisa): nah there's not really romance

Marisa (Mawisa): pls come donate to anime shelf shrine
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: First time in class, 3 weeks in
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Teacher says this isn't an english course
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm gonna be able to completely be able to BS this course
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: THIS TEACHER APPARENTLY SENT EVERYBODY A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: AS A SOURCE ABOUT SOMETHING
Anna (loud and likely blonde): at least hes realistic
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i mean yeah but public policy is like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: all about papers
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and research
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: like 
it should be really really thorough and well written
Anna (loud and likely blonde): o its public policy? Thats cool. is it unfortunately one of those things thats ever shifting so you cant have a textbook on current versions
Friend had a class like that. the class was so new they were basically writing the textbooks on it by being in class
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ye
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I love it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but its so painful
Anna (loud and likely blonde): unfortunately what we study usually causes suffering
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: like literally the entire time their like "yeah nobody is ever gonna thank you for anything, half your work is gonna be ignored for politics, and honestly all these problems are lowkey impossible to actually solve but they're gonna expect you to come up with a solution
Jamie (Jamie): Kinda love how this expression came out soooo sharing lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they cute af
Jamie (Jamie): <@301927856240459777> I only got like 2 more panels after this and i can post the second page after the 2 year hiatus after posting the first page lol
Jamie (Jamie): Thank lol learned while drawing this that checking poses for comfort and actual ability to do is very important lol ~~I mean i already knee this but it was reinstated in my mind~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yooo its cute
Jamie (Jamie): Thaannk i try
Jamie (Jamie): Training to draw them good anime big eyes well ~~harder than it seems to not have them look well child drawn~~
Marisa (Mawisa): WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Marisa (Mawisa): WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Marisa (Mawisa): hiatus almost over
Marisa (Mawisa): long hiatus
Marisa (Mawisa): so long
Jamie (Jamie): ~~doesnt post page 3 for 5 years~~
Jamie (Jamie): Jkjk 😂😂😂
Marisa (Mawisa): i'd perish
Jamie (Jamie): but nah once I post it Ima try to get like 3 pages ahead and then start posting weekly long as I can stay ahead of that weeks page work
Jamie (Jamie): I mean there's at least like 4 if not 5 or more arcs involved in this story and I wanna tell it all so shit needs to start flying off my pen
Marisa (Mawisa): how should i organize my japanese manga shelves
how come bookstores in the US are sorted by genre and author's last name but manga are sold alphabetically by title
Marisa (Mawisa): english manga organized by alphabet
before japanese manga were just organized randomly but i want some sense now. i can do it alphabetically by english title, alphabetically by japanese title, by author, or how they do it in japan which is by publisher and then some dark twisted other logic i'd have to look up because it's weird
Jamie (Jamie): I get annoyed sometimes with how places have manga by title specially when I'm searching for manga by a single manga creator like Arina Tenamura and I have to search online for what titles she has done and then scour the shelves between the romanji title and english
Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH
i get so shocked when i see a series in english sometimes because i didn't realize it had an english release because the names are so different
like not even the translation throws me off it's just a totally different name
Marisa (Mawisa): o wow i have all of Full Moon as manga and an anime this is gonna be a fun night
Jamie (Jamie): 👀 I want
Jamie (Jamie): thats one of the series I goal to collect in full
Marisa (Mawisa): i got all the manga when borders went out of business
the dvd i have no idea. i forgot 80% of the dvds i own, meaning i must've gotten it by chance during a crunchy sale like their 30 for $30 sale
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i come back to my desk and my boss is arguing with people over how much a gorilla weighs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol what.. XD
Marisa (Mawisa): so how much does it weigh?
Marisa (Mawisa): which gorrila we talkin about?
Jamie (Jamie): oof nice, closest I got is i have all but like 6 issues of fruits basket and i got 16 of them last katsu for 60 bucks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Harambe
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 800lbs?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Please don't fat shame the gorilla
Marisa (Mawisa): I messed up
Marisa (Mawisa): NO I DIDJT WERE GOOD
Marisa (Mawisa): But I’m missing volume 8 of suijin no ikenie pls let it be here
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mangoss~ 😛
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: having every single manga in a series is a super satisfying feeling
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ 100% is
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I own every single one of the Whistle! manga
Marisa (Mawisa): might as well burn everything if I’m missing one
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And then missing any volume is just pure panic lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And that is so satisfying because it isn't printed in english anymore
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Like I hunted the last 3 books i needed for it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: at cons
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: for like 2 and a half years
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~ik i could order it online but its just not the same as hunting for and finding a book~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need to finish my FMA collection. I'm missing the last few volumes and like1 of the first volumes. But I haven't seen them printed in single mangas anymore. Only the combined 3 books in one form. And oof I don't like those...
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah those are extra
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Rebecca in dealers halls at cons they're are a bunch of Manga sellers
Marisa (Mawisa): my friend has a life mission to collect all the VHS tapes she can find of a very specific Barney episode just so she can publicly embarrass Todd Haberkorn at every convention he goes to
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao what? XD
Marisa (Mawisa): i have some FMA volumes that are just the anime printed as manga
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~I know them all by heart now cause I've been hunting so long~~
Marisa (Mawisa): what was i doing with that. i did that for a series and i can't remember what it is. i never found the last one.
Marisa (Mawisa): KAMICHAMA KARIN
Marisa (Mawisa): DANG IT I NEED IT
Marisa (Mawisa): there are amazon sellers of it now. bless.
Marisa (Mawisa): i had to like, arrange a shady deal with a rightstuf agent to get copies of 4-6
Marisa (Mawisa): it's all on amazon for an affordable price this is so beautiful
Jamie (Jamie): omg kamichama karin i love that series!!!!
Marisa (Mawisa): [scoots in closer] hey gurl
Jamie (Jamie): gimme them god children yes please
Marisa (Mawisa): i love how cute the manga is
Marisa (Mawisa): how did they get away with letting kazune get drunk multiple times isn't he like 6 years old
Marisa (Mawisa): children pls
Jamie (Jamie): Right omg and yes that art style though
Jamie (Jamie): And the story itself is so crazy amazing too like plot twist? Okay lets turn it up to 100 for that
Marisa (Mawisa): i found the missing suijin volume we're all good
Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH
Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH REALLY
Marisa (Mawisa): and then have you read chu? chu is just weird
Jamie (Jamie): I think i watched some of it? Or did read it? Its been so long ugh but yea

Jamie (Jamie): 
Jamie (Jamie): Theres more but
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm V sad that my manga collection is small... I sold a bunch of mine years ago cause I ran out of room T_T
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~its ok u have more than me~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i have. 3 volumes. of random manga
Jamie (Jamie): oof i could never sell ~~well except for the random volumes from mega series like naruto and bleach and death note oh and hina~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Most of them were One Piece but still T_T~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I don't tend to reread so id rather collect art
Marisa (Mawisa): aww dengeki daisy
i always get black bird mixed up with another manga. is that the one with the girl who's the white crow?
oooo wow beast master that rings a bell but i can't remember it at all rip
omg i've been waiting for dawn of the arcana to update. i guess that's why it hasn't updated, it was licensed.
I HAVE MISTRESS FORTUNE TOO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I had a good chunk of the series when it was still in the lower volume numbers... now I onyl have like 5 volumes of it?
