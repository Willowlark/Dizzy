meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): So starbucks is coming out with a new drink flavor (I think next week? Idk exactly when) but it‚Äôs maple butter shortbread. It‚Äôs meh in a latte but the frappechino  tastes JUST like a frozen butterbeer from Orlando‚Äôs Harry Potter World üëåüèª
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yum
Marisa (Mawisa): the homestuck fandom is back at it again
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Its soooooo good

Marisa (Mawisa): i like when they just start breakdancing
Marisa (Mawisa): which is like 25% of it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was going to say, *which times?*
Marisa (Mawisa): hohenheim shows up and just starts groovin
*any* character just shows up and starts grooving
Marisa (Mawisa): it's exactly like the anime
Marisa (Mawisa): i love the audience going crazy too, that's really rare at shows in japan
Marisa (Mawisa): they've done other anime too woah. 
dangan ronpa: "A corpse has been discovered!" [everyone starts dancing]
Marisa (Mawisa): i think these are the finale skits of a big dance competition
Marisa (Mawisa): that explains the cheering
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that was truly beautiful
Erik (Red Riot Thot): maybe I missed it, but did they cut Nina out? lol
Marisa (Mawisa): they didn't want to traumatize the audience *too* badly

Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~or this is one guy with many profiles~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yes, block him.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): There is no reason to hesitate, followers aren't friends.

Rebecca (madameterralupus): This shit is weird. And the guy who was messaging Georgia earlier has another account linked on his one photos that looks to be possibly stealing another cosplayers work?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ah! I didn‚Äôt fill out that form, I directly reported it from Instagram
Georgia (Something Sensible): I‚Äôll try that form!
Anna (Cadmium): jesus theres a bunch of oddly linked accounts which all. have few photos and few followers. literally whats the point of stealing other peoples content.
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): I added her on snap time to see what's up
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just want to know if this is one person doing all these oddly linked accounts or multiple ü§î

Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I don't need abs necessarily, i mostly just need to loose some flab.~~
Anna (Cadmium): same i feel that
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: So whenever we wanna do a group month thing (the abs, inktober, etc) we can put updates in there!

Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Question Pennsylvania people
Anna (Cadmium): side note: adding a roller stick to my con bag was the greatest idea ever
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Yall are mostly like an hour away from Newark right
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Newark, DE  correct?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): A little over an hour ye
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: What if we found a location we could get together on weekends that was like 30ish minites away each
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: To just do some work out
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Outdoors obviously when the weather was better
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That'd be cool. I'm usually only free on Sundays though cause work (planning to schedule self Sat's soon for more monies)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): perhaps
Erik (Red Riot Thot): why is it that my Katsu lineup post got to 100+ likes quicker than any of my actual content? xD
Jess (whoozica): who knows insta is a mystery
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I too started to do that pixel a day thing that was shared and I really like it. I think it would be good to help keep my mental health in check. ü§î Cause I really want to better it this year and not let the negative affect me so much. I want to kick depression's ass out this year. üí™
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye! i started doing it last year and it kinda helps with monitoring periods of time where you feel really bad vs times when you feel good/ok
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its helpful for pinpointing causes of things and kinda helps you keep your head up
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 10/10 would recommend
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): meanwhile me, twenty minutes ago: "I'm probably just going to put average on every day aren't I"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's going to be me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): average, uneventful, etc...
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I'm not good at self evaluation.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I know we are only 3 days in but like so far this year is already going good. I'm not all that depressed or anxious like I was last year this time üëå ~~probs cause don't have to have a surgery tomorrow lol~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i have bdp, so mine usually end up being one extreme or another....but its still helpful~~
Jess (whoozica): OH tip for all people who menstruate (esp. if you arent on BC or another type of hormonal supplement)  your moods can rely heavily on the different levels of hormones your body produces at different times of the month. i started tracking that awhile ago and it was such a strct pattern it was insane
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Yeaaa pretty sure the reason I've been so depressed the past few months is cause I ran out and can't get them refilled till I see doc sooo my body's like lmao let's freak the fuck out!~~
Anna (Cadmium): o crap i gotta see if my meds doc can take my new insurance
Anna (Cadmium): <@!169297844874903552>  try project ruby u can get them with a phone call
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hormones are whack I agree
Anna (Cadmium): its not the GREATEST IDEA but like if u need them to funciton.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: whats the pixel a day thing?
Jess (whoozica): Yea I used to be like a ray of sunshine for 2 weeks and then down I. The dumps for two weeks, rinse and repeat
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Pixel a day is where you fill in a block (on paper, excel or etc) wit a color to show what your mood was that day.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ah 
neet
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I use a mood tracking app on my phone
Jess (whoozica): <@386874959009415170>  Pura Still isn't sold in NJ üò≠
