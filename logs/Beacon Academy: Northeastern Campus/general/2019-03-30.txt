Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~this dumbass is lucky he's cute~~
Anna (Blonde Banshee): On a better note success on dying fabric I think!
Mark (Mad Doctor): So lemme float an idea:
I'm old, but I'm not ready for the home yet. And I don't look forward to entering one, since they seem to be filled with depressing old people. But what if there were any old folks home for nerds? D&D sessions that last from dawn until the early bird special. Movie marathons every day. A friggin cosplay studio. A board and video game library. Hell, the grandkids would actually *want* to visit. Now all I need is a few million in venture capital...
Georgia (Something Sensible): If any of us win the lottery I would vote putting money towards old nerds home
Anna (Blonde Banshee): I agree
