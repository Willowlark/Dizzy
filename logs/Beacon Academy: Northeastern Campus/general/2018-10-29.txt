Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Kill... Me...*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Marisa (Weeb): Give her Teeth
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she looks like when youre in an arguement spewing facts you didnt check
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and then you realize youre wrong halfway through
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but you dont want to admit you were wrong
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so you just
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, if I were to spend $550 on a statue, I'd want something that looks a little less derpy
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~is this not Leanna's alt account?~~
Marisa (Weeb): oh man remember when everyone on tumblr would change their url to be spooky
Tom (tomukuncosplay): People are all doing that on insta
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OH MY GOD I DID THAT BACK IN 2012
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I did it on Twitter briefly
Georgia (Something Sensible): I remember when that was a think
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also my dorm building is doing a costume contest you just have to DM your costume to the building Instagram
Georgia (Something Sensible): Is it cheating for a cosplayer to enter? 😂
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oof
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Maybe a lil
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Nahhh
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cosplay=costume play
Completely valid
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): You arent a paid professional so you still can enter amateur competitions
Georgia (Something Sensible): I like that answer, I’m gonna go with that answer 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also I saw this add on Instagram
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I read it as “match your brother” for a second
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I was liKE WHAT THE FUCK KINDA ADVERTISEMENT
Georgia (Something Sensible): Until I realized my brain has misread it entirely lmao
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve seen those for awhile.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Poor ad placement.
Georgia (Something Sensible): The white font on white sheets makes the bottom warp a bit
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hence, my internal autocorrect misread it as brother
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 🤔
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): See I read the word bottom and my mind immediately goes somewhere else. I’ve read too much fanfiction 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): incest.................... kinky fanfic............... this advertisement is going to all the wrong places
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): None of witch were it’s intent 😂
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Idk witches tend to be kinky
Georgia (Something Sensible): i mean the points to sell underwear
Georgia (Something Sensible): but now im just uncomfortable thinking of having matching underwear with a brother i dont have
Georgia (Something Sensible): i cant imagine how much worse it is for someone who HAS a brother
Georgia (Something Sensible): at least matching your bottom makes kinda sense
Georgia (Something Sensible): like.... ok advertisement, i see you, maybe i will coordinate underwear with my bottom thank you
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~so we already know Kiri definitely buys bakugou clothes~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~its cause he wants to match his bottom~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The bottom would coordinate with the top wouldn’t they.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Not necessarily
Georgia (Something Sensible): is this a thinly veiled nsfw topic or
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think either or could coordinate
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Remember, bottom vs top isn't necessarily a dom or sub thing
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Its about who is getting penetrated
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Exactly
Georgia (Something Sensible): its about where they are in each others hearts, not on the bed *dabs*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cute thought 
But no
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Also doesn’t matter who buys who underwhere. As long as the match #couplegoals
Mark (Mad Doctor): Lannister® brand lingerie. For when you're close to your partner. Really close
