Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 My professor really likes to use cons/cosplay as an example when explaining certain communication theories/things often lol
Jess (whoozica): maybe they a nerd
Georgia (Something Sensible): definitely a nerd
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe? The other week someone in class asked what cosplay was... He asked me to explain it since I mentioned I do it XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): omg we had a physics major panel the other week where we could ask the head professor any questions we wanted
Georgia (Something Sensible): so i asked if he had given up his hobbies in exchange for more time to do physics
Georgia (Something Sensible): and he was like "no im still very active in my choir. let me turn the question around to you. are there any hobbies youre worried you may have to give up for physics?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): and i was like UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Georgia (Something Sensible): "well i cosplay. so. on the weekends. i geek out at conventions"
Georgia (Something Sensible): and he just nods and goes "good. hold onto that"
Georgia (Something Sensible): so tl;dr every physics major at rutgers now knows im a NERD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol. Relatable. Many of my professors in the comm dept know I am a mega nerd too XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I love my radio professor cause he is deff a nerd. The other semester we had to do a group project combined with another class and he goes "Your basically becoming Voltron". No one got it but me XD
Jess (whoozica): whuuuuuttt
Jess (whoozica): i was a graphic design makor, but the sollege groups alot of our classes with gaming design majors so everyone was either a nerd or a hipster or somewhere inbetween
Marisa (Weeb): wow NERDS
Georgia (Something Sensible): you were both? :V
Jess (whoozica): 🤷  maaaaaybeeeeee
Jess (whoozica): I remember one kid started talking about hating one of my fav games and i was like D:! and then he was like "But (my fav character) is great" and i was like "ok i forgive you"
