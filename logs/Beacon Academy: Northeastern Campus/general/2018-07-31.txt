Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I absolutely swear by mine, fyi.
Erik (slendergiant): Haha! I have an Android! Your impulse buying temptations have no power here!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They're... bluetooth compatible with anything.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 😂
Jess (whoozica): they fall out of my tiny ear canals
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): not the switch though, you need to get a special receiver for that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was disappointed about that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm wonder exactly how many people did the poll though.
Erik (slendergiant): https://imgflip.com/i/2f19he
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I used to be that way.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I hacked every phone I had.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just got tired of *needing* to.
Erik (slendergiant): I lost one of my main pro-Android arguments with my current phone which was being able to access the battery...
Erik (slendergiant): But I can still add a micro SD card
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I stream music via apple music (originally google music) so storage has never been an issue. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Erik (slendergiant): my main storage issue was photos 😛
Erik (slendergiant): I stream my music via Spotify
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I autoback up my camera roll via onedrive/google drive/lightroom CC.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Which does require me to go through and delete all the memes and screen caps I've shared to discord. That annoys me.
Jess (whoozica): 🍿
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Otherwise I'd have a bunch of junk in there.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Apps should really differential between photo photos and images downloaded~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Course, I don't take too many photo photos on my phone, so long as the photo queen isn't around.
Erik (slendergiant): I just keep everything on the card lol
