Erik (Red Riot Thot): Honestly Blake Momo would be better
Mark (Mad Doctor): Kinda wanna cast Ren as Tsuyu
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Wait or jiro Blake?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Honestly I think momo fits best with Pyrrha
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That was my second choice

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Momo doesn't have the confidence for Pyrrha.

Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Erik
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Also
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Qrow Aizawa
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Port Eraser Mic maybe
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm feeling more Oobleck Present Mic
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Port has more of the personality of All Might
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Def oobleck present mic there's too much energy to be port. 
I was thinking nedzu for port actually?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): erik you work quick
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~we need a croc emoji~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~oh dear lord XD~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Bless you Erik
Georgia (Something Sensible): Momo Pyrrha is two competent queens  in one and Iâ€™m living for it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~They share a bond of more skin than practical for combat attire~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg the similarities are staggering
Georgia (Something Sensible): That explains why I wanted to cosplay Momo first ~~but didnâ€™t wanna fuck with lacefront wigs or gravity defying boobs~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I just. Can't like Momo. There's just not enough content to her as a human, all the author cares about with her is her rack IMO.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I fear for the bobbies of every Momo cosplayer I see
Georgia (Something Sensible): I donâ€™t trust the friction of fabric enough to keep the girlies in place
Marisa (Mawisa): I could cosplay her with that fake chest I bought in japan
Georgia (Something Sensible): Thereâ€™s also the Momo outfit from the stage play
Georgia (Something Sensible): Iâ€™d go to the trouble of learning to make prosthetics, just make prosthetic boobs, and then be like HAHA TRY JERKING OFF TO FAKE BOOBS PERVERTS
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean... theyâ€™d still do it but Iâ€™d feel personal accomplishment
Matt (mattmyers25): I just unpacked from katsu
Jess (whoozica): Doing better that me
