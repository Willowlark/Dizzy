Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm thinking of cutting my hair to around this length again. Short but not too short cause when it frames my face too much it looks bad. Sits just around the shoulders. Yes? No?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it looks very cute on you, its a good length i think!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm just getting fed up with my hair right now and it's only like about mid breast right now xD so much for growing it back out to where it was originally LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): long hair is hella hard to deal with
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's annoying and hot as hell ðŸ˜­ we aren't even into summer yet and I'm dying of heat from this length...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what a mood, thats exactly the reason i originally cut my hair short a long time ago
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its so freaking warm
Georgia (Something Sensible): Rebecca Iâ€™m curious what would you look like with a side part?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Have you ever had that kinda style?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't look bad with one just just don't like it. Falls in my face too much and feels odd to me... lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Holy crap u look cute with that length
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Kinda a quick messy side part lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lmao wow I look like trash today. Oof~~

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO ANNA
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay but like yea I can side part my hair but it feels really loop sided on my head... like so uneven and I don't like it xD also doesn't really stay well
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lol Anna xD thank you
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: That cause u don't part your hair there ever so it's very unhappy parted their it needs to get used to it. 
But I like the shorter length it cute. Also will be lighter for summer and ~~fit under a wig cap easier im jealous~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: U welc lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm my hair fit so much better under a wig cap when shorter and I was like <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351> but hated it past chin length LOL.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's not too much longer now than it is in that pic but a few inches racks up lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: The difference between ponytail-ableand not ponytail-able is important too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ AGREE
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee!
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I need to hack a couple inches off mine but I'm just. So lazy.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I could put it in one at that length. A smol one though lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i was feeling the short short hair for a big but then i realized i couldnt ponytail, dont do that to yourself xD
Georgia (Something Sensible): You could make very smol ponytails lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): I ponytail Noahâ€™s hair, he hates it

Georgia (Something Sensible): oooo have you tried layers?
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have a round face too
Georgia (Something Sensible): my hairstylist said layers help frame mah fae
