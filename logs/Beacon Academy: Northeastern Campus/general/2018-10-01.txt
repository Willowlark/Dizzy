Evie (Katheryne Knight): Noice
Erik (slendergiant): Now I'm trying to think if that's how mine is...
Erik (slendergiant): So this whole week pretty much I'm going to be doing those big ground cables I posted about in my story last week. I think I can skip the gym this week because it's a *workout*
Erik (slendergiant): Have to cut the cable by hand using these bad boys
Erik (slendergiant): Strip the ends (which gets done on a machine, but I have to bend it back and forth after to actually separate the jacket)
Erik (slendergiant): And then I have to crimp both ends with this pneumatic crimper which takes between 36-39 pumps to do each
Erik (slendergiant): Like, I think there's a visible increase in my arm muscles since this morning... And I *only* did 24
Jess (whoozica): holy shit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa deff sounds like an arm work out to me. Oof ðŸ˜‚
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Ooof
