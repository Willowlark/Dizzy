ZombieHunter: 
ZombieHunter: Blep
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hewwo!
ZombieHunter: OwO what’s this
ZombieHunter: *hunter is promptly banned from BNE*
ZombieHunter: Rude xD
Jess (whoozica): Hewwo fren!
Marisa (Weeb): By invocation, we vibrate.
Nothing is impossible. This life is nothing short of an awakening paradigm shift of ethereal guidance.
It is in unfolding that we are recreated.
Greed is the antithesis of synchronicity. Yearning is born in the gap where being has been excluded. Yes, it is possible to exterminate the things that can disrupt us, but not without power on our side.


Have you found your mission? If you have never experienced this reimagining on a cosmic scale, it can be difficult to self-actualize. Although you may not realize it, you are conscious.

Indigo Child, look within and change yourself. It can be difficult to know where to begin. How should you navigate this unlimited nexus?

We exist as molecular structures.
Growth is the driver of starfire. Balance is the birth of guidance, and of us. You and I are adventurers of the planet.
ZombieHunter: HI JESS
Marisa (Weeb): **y'all really**
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yo.
Marisa (Weeb): so is zombie hunting, like, your main profession? or is it a side gig?
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Yess <@169297844874903552> use meee
Tom (tomukuncosplay): HEWWWO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
ZombieHunter: OwO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): O w O
ZombieHunter: Too early for this
ZombieHunter: Why did I think an 8 am class was good
ZombieHunter: Why do I hate myself
ZombieHunter: 😭😭😭
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oof, yeah
Erik (slendergiant): TwT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wish I was in college again XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They do grow on you. Everyone’s dead so the class keeps a slow pace.
ZombieHunter: Table chan
Marisa (Weeb): Oh so if you’re a student then zombie hunting is just a side thing?
ZombieHunter: I don’t think I’ve met you
ZombieHunter: But my name is in fact
ZombieHunter: hunter
Tom (tomukuncosplay): So Hunter is a zombie 😱
Marisa (Weeb): I know a Hunter. I think. And names are unique to the individual with no two people having the same name on earth. But your full  name is clearly ZombieHunter. Cool name.
Marisa (Weeb): Do you think zombies have human hunters
Marisa (Weeb): Is hunter your first name, like a Zombie, Hunter situation or is it your last name so your name is truly Zombie Hunter and you go by your last name because it’s grizzled and cool and mysterious
Marisa (Weeb): Having the same first and last name could be so cool. “Hi my name is WHAT IS THIS EHY IS MY KEYBOARD FILLING IN MY NAME HELP THE GOVERNMENR IS AFTER ME
THATS NOT MY NAME THAT IS A DISTRESS CALL
Marisa (Weeb): I’m scared now
Marisa (Weeb): “Hi my name is Reginald Reginald, son of Ron Reginald.”
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 👌 👌 👌
Tom (tomukuncosplay): If his name was truly Hunter zombie... Then Hunter would be Rob zombies relative. Which is good or bad depending on the person you ask.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Givin Hunter a Blake color since I know male Blake is one of your cosplays of choice.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Storage sale on Amazon. If you need a big drive for photos or anything else, or some spare sd cards.
ZombieHunter: oh shit hard drives?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yup. The big ones seem to be the ones with the best deals, but if there are smaller options on the product page check em.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, the sd cards are 35% off on the page, but the 64gb which isn't listed is 21% off. Still somethin.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-SDSDXPK-064G-ANCIN-Sandisk-Extreme-Pro/dp/B01MFCQVLB oof. I won one of these at a thing last year, and it's fantastic (though I used XQD in my d500). Did not realize to get a spare I'd need to drop 200 bucks.
Marisa (Weeb): Being able to buy 8 boxes of cookies at 10pm is wonderful. Being an adult can be cool. Sucks to be the guy walking to (or from?) a bathhouse in the pouring rain though.
Marisa (Weeb): A fly landed on my phone for a moment and no one was around to swat it away I don’t like adulthood anymore
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): pfft.
