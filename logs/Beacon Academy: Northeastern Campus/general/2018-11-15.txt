Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof I‚Äôve been inactive as heck because work and Fallout
Erik (Red Riot Thot): mood
Erik (Red Riot Thot): don't you just hate when you have a song stuck in your head, but it's instrumental, and you can't remember *exactly* how it goes, but you have no way of knowing what the actual song is?
Jess (whoozica): YES
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't even remember where I heard it. It was either in a Spotify playlist I didn't save or on a Pandora station that I haven't listened to in ages
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm currently listening to the Pandora station I think it may have been from in an attempt to find it
Marisa (Weeb): there's a website for that
Marisa (Weeb): https://www.midomi.com/
Marisa (Weeb): idk how comprehensive it is. i used to use one like that for anime but i don't remember if it was that site
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the problem is that I don't know exactly how it goes, hence why I want to hear it again xD
Marisa (Weeb): OH midomi does have anime stuff on it! you gotta be specific though like I had to sing because humming didn't work

that sucks tho may you find it some day
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think I'm on the right track. This Pandora station seems to be the right one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Relaxation Radio* in case anyone is interested

Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/30/17409664/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-eevee-switch-pokeball-plus
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```Additionally, certain Pok√©mon will be version exclusive. So far we know that Oddish, Sandshrew and Growlithe will only appear in the wild in Let‚Äôs Go, Pikachu! while Bellsprout, Vulpix, and Meowth will only be in Let‚Äôs Go, Eevee!```
