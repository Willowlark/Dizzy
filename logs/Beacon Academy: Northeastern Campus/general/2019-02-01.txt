Rebecca (madameterralupus): I got a Jess and Georgia~!! 
~~Also if anyone needs Weiss or Qrow and has doubles to trade lemme know. I shared who I am looking for on insta~~
Jess (whoozica): It's too early for this shit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): what the actual fuck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...excuse me?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO???????????
Jess (whoozica): No fucking clue 😂
Mark (Mad Doctor): Can I just express my support for filters?
Jess (whoozica): Like spam filters?
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): 😶 what the heck
Erik (Red Riot Thot): you can add words to a filter list so any comments containing those words don't show up for anyone except the person who wrote it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Jess (whoozica): Ooo ok  I'll add "pig"
Mark (Mad Doctor): I meant those filters that keep us from saying or writing things that make other people feel hurt or uncomfortable
Mark (Mad Doctor): And sadly, insta has no way to block cringe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Today is Monty Oum day so we all better kick Con crunches ass today
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or just today's ass in general. Make work your bitch
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Just going to leave this here because honestly arkos is a shitty relationship all around
Anna (loud and likely blonde): he loved her but *not the way she loved him*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YUP
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): he loved her as a friend but I don’t think his feelings ever went past friendship
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RIP Pyrrha.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): poor girl.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Renora be two best friends trusting each other enough to take that next step. Arkos be unrequited love cut short, with the other party chasing someone else.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ^^^^^^^^
Anna (loud and likely blonde): chasing someone else bc they too either dense or emotionally constipated to realize they could probs talk it through
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Who knows what would have happened if Pyrrha didn't enter the dust bowl.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): renora is like. mutually beneficial
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Especially if White Knight gains traction in future seasons. Pyrrha would die internally.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and equal contribution from both sides and thats why it works
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Unrequited love is a special level of hell.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~it rlly is~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I mistyped dead talk but it's still accurate~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): We have no evidence that he ever cared for her as more then a friend. He dropped his advances with weiss at the dance because once again he felt sorry for and GUILTY for Pyrrha’s loneliness. She was his best friend and mentor and after vol 3 he felt guilty for her death because she went to deal with cinder alone because he was too incompetent a huntsman
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He *did* try to talk her out of it before she shoved him in a locker and blasted him off
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk i read that as jaune kinda just kept going after pretty girls bc he felt inadequate
Jess (whoozica): ~~i dont even like remebr season 1-3 that well~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yeah but wouldn’t you try to convince any good friend who was about to run to their death not to?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Valid
Jess (whoozica): never really like jaune in the beginning cuz he was like "typical skirt chaser"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeahhhhhhh
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk if i like him as a character or not
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He's getting better.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): In the beginning he was a blank slate generic *dude*.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hes less insufferable now
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ^
Jess (whoozica): yea hes better now
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i know frat bros with more substance than s1-3 jaune~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but yea, arkos wasnt canon, pyrha simply had a one sided crush on jaune
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He's had growth and especially with Vol 6 I think he's starting to become more competent a leader
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~look Monty wasn't much of a writer, his talents were animation and design~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Bees are more canon than Arkos
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~bees are more canon than renora~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but ye
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): BEES HAS MORE SUBSTANCE THEN ARKOS
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh yeah im so glad they make him more of a three dimensional character this past season
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leader!Jaune is aesthetic.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): arkos was just pining
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Arkos was nothing but pining
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Honestly the growth in Jaune, Ruby, and Oscar this season was a blessing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Honestly they all had *significant* growth this season
Jess (whoozica): i mean arckos became... something and then she died sooo
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, everyone
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Arkos *could* have happened. But not in the time it had.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): cut short
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): *Could* have is the key term tho, it didn’t
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): pyrrha is the one to initiate everything too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if she didnt reach to hold jaunes hand, or if she didnt kiss jaune nothing would have happened at all...because jaune didnt like her like that
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): E X A C T L T 👏🏻
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): E X A C T L Y 👏🏻
Jess (whoozica): poor pyrrha
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): They put her on a pedestal only to watch it crumble
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *She took what she wanted because she knew she'd never get another chance*
Jess (whoozica): ~~ye i mean if you know you're gonna die might as well kiss the dude and die happy~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~deleted scene is the fuck in the locker and then she goes up the tower~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~of course if were going on "he didnt like her all" that would be messed up so i retract my statement~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ruby has grown in her abilities and leadership
Weiss has been continuing to become warmer to everyone
Blake conquered her fears and is opening up to the rest of the group more
Yang also conquered her fears and bees happened
Jaune is becoming more tactical and a better leader
Nora is perfect in every way. Best girl.
Ren is becoming less reclusive and showing more happy emotions
Oscar is becoming a better fighter and learning to cope with Oz (or lack thereof) in his head
Qrow (hopefully) is starting to realize he needs to stop the drinking and realizing these kids can actually do things
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *GOOD POINT* Unreciprocated feelings wouldn't be so sad if it was like that.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i think its more like. he liked her somehow and didnt realize it and then by the time he realized he had any feelings she was long dead and thats why hes been a depressed angry boy the whole time after
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I don’t think he didn’t like her at all, just looking back I don’t see any romantic feelings on his end
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yea like he def liked her, but not like he liked weiss
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also yea erik
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the growth was amazing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im so grateful xD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but did he like weiss or was he just chasing her cause shes pretty
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): The growth has been amazing and MUCH needed. Roosterteeth really stepped up theirs game this past year
Anna (loud and likely blonde): tbh i never saw much substance in white knight but like i also wasnt paying attention
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh no, theres zero substance
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Absolutely none
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but he was actively chasing her because he liked her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ghe didnt do that with pyrrha
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she was just his best friend
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He only liked Weiss because she was the famous pretty rich girl
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Weiss was 10milies out of his league and he still chased her. Pyrrha was on the same level and he never gave her a second glance
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): SO WAS PYRRHA
Erik (Red Riot Thot): except he had no idea who she was
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh yeah she was out of her league
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wait he knew who she was
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Didn’t know who weiss was either until she told him her name
Anna (loud and likely blonde): didnt he literally run up and say 'your the girl from the pumpkin pete box'
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No he didn't know who Pyrrha was
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~the boy is just dumb jfc~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ye Weiss had to tell him who she was. He just thought she was a nobody
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~HES a blonde oblivious is in his dna~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~tbh, weiss seemed more interested in pyrrha than jaune lmao~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): pfft.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Truuu
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Weiss x Pyrrha
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm rewatching the one episode
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the only thing unrealistic about rwby ships is the amount of hair in one bed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ajdsfkjs  omg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LmAO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Pyrrha says "Nice to meet you Jaune" and he literally pushes her away saying "Yeah yeah" and continues advancing on Weiss
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~dick move dude~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): listen THERES A REASON USUALLY ONE LESBIAN HAS SHORT HAIR IN THE RELATIONSHIP
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~leggo weiss and pyrrha ships now~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lets braid the ponytails together for some stupid cute photos
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they do have matching ponytails
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:lenny:456549338026344489> ~~Eyo Pyrrha's when I get my Weiss together let's go LOL~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm not saying there's much backing for White Knight (tbh v1-3 was terrible for shipping fuel and my opinions of the writing have been said) but it's an example of Jaune becoming even more unattainable for Pyrrha. ~~*And then she watches through out the series as the two bond and dies more and more everytime Weiss and Jaune get closer*~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And *then* calls Pyrrha "hot stuff"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): asdjsdkgha
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~multiple weiss and multiple pyrrhas a la ME!ME!ME!~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Weiss: "Do you know who you're talking to?"
Jaune: "Not in the slightest, Snow Angel"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): was he playing dumb or
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): See he didn’t know who either of them were until weiss explained everything to him
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): which is why Pyrrha feel for him.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IM SCREAMING
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WHAT DELUSION IS THIS BOI LIVING IN
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~meanwhile Weiss was the exact opposite and cared a lot about titles~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u kno as infuriating as that is. at least its not an adam sympathizer
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): TRUTH
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pyrrha is kinda emotionally stunted. Because she never had a relationship, or really friendships without her talents hanging over her head.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ BIG MOOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean she was, but she wasnt an asshole
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like jaune
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she genuinely cared for people and tried to socialize
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she was just awkward
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup. stunted != jerk
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im just saying, jaune definitely did not have the emotional aspect on pyrrha
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): over? not at ALL.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pyrrha had all the emotions.
Jess (whoozica): ye jaunes emotion was ~~lets get this dick wet~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Jess (whoozica): hes much better now tho
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye, thankfully
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He was a blank slate.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yeah and it only took him 6 seasons to get half way there
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): still my least favorite character
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but at least hes not as much of a fuckboi
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://giphy.com/gifs/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-kris-jenner-l3JDFJncJHteKIYzm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Monty filled him with whatever bit joke was needed, especially as the sole male. (sorry ren but)
Jess (whoozica): yea it was insta fuck boi that turned me off right away
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's why Fanfic tends to overwrite him a lot.
Jess (whoozica): LOL someone im friends with on facebook (older woman) just said the have to go see "Dr. Weiss" today
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Some dude on insta: -dms me to say im cute-
Me: oh, uh thanks!
him: -sends me 6 separate posts from my own page- "see"

.....y-yea.. thats.... me ....hah >.>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Respond with "Thanks I know I am." I hear that scares them away when you are confident apparently 🤷 lol
Jess (whoozica): OOF
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you know what else scares em off?
Jess (whoozica): "yes that is indeed my image, thank you"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 🖕
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"Thanks for letting me know what I look like when I look like a fictional character"*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): send him a picture of a banana slicer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GOOD PLAN
Rebecca (madameterralupus): "Gee thanks. I had no idea I was so cute! Thanks for helping me notice!"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but really rebecca is right saying "thanks" or "I know" apparently makes them go wtf nvm and leave
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Indeed. Why idk. It weirddd
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~bc they just tryna toy with ppl not actually talk. the ones that accept the thank you are most likely better humans~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the part im stuck on is that he sent me ...6 photos.. of myself
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like???? yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that sure is me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont own a mirror
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): who took these photos
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like does he think ya don't know what ya look like? Lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~still better than the guy who sent me like 15 pics of cosplayers who he thought were me and WERENT~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wait did he send u pics of u that you postd on your insta already?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): if I were famous and people wanted to talk to me, I'd leave them all on message request and only talk to people I've met in person. <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Is anyone here allergic to tree nuts?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@!289944569410224129> yea he sent me posts of myself from MY insta
Anna (loud and likely blonde): y i k e
Mark (Mad Doctor): I guess that's better than pictures of you taken from afar with a telephoto lens, but still...
Georgia (Something Sensible): Speakin of nuts
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Today I learned “make your nut” means to attain wealth
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Georgia (Something Sensible): _my reaction as well_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~so when people nut they ain't being lewd. They just making wealth! 😂~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~~fuck bitches, get money?~~*
Georgia (Something Sensible): It means that you should be careful in typing “make me nut” versus “make my nut”
Georgia (Something Sensible): One is for nudes, the other for money, don’t get them confused 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Evie (Katheryne Knight): "Good morning son. Let's make these nuts"
Matt (mattmyers25): Deez nuts?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"Let's get this but bread"*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 👌
Georgia (Something Sensible): nut bread is just extreme amounts of wealth now CONFIRMED
Jess (whoozica): I was gonna order business cards for katsu so they look really professional. i was get rounded corners cuz das neat but idk if the rounded corners complements my design or not
Erik (Red Riot Thot): what does it look like?
Jess (whoozica): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh i love the rounded corners tbh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The rounded corners look V nice
Jess (whoozica): yea i think they might be growin on me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it somehow gives it more dimension i think
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it compliments the angular design with a soft edge, its classy
Jess (whoozica): the triangle with round element got me thinking, but theres a round element in the middle
Jess (whoozica): so i think it balances still
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oof don't remind me I wanted new cards and gave up.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I like the rounded
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Same Bill lol.~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it's different and stands out

Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: can we talk about how hardcore whale evolution is
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Animals took forever to evolve and live outside water
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: then mammals spawned
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and then the ancestor of the whale was like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: "Ya know what, FUCK THE LAND"
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and slowly evolved to live in water
Mark (Mad Doctor): Mood
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Anyone in the market for a 72lb wheel of cheese?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Whole-Wheel-Parmigiano-Reggiano%2C-72-lbs.-.product.100096211.html
Jess (whoozica): fuck ya
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *i can eat that*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): LEGGO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): for 12 people its 75 dollars each and we get 6lbs each
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yet my local cheese shop sells good quality parm for $14/lb. Seems like a scam designed to lure the "big cheese" crowd
Anna (loud and likely blonde): is $12.50/lb for costco our lord and savior
Georgia (Something Sensible): I need that big cheese to put on my bucket of Mac and cheese
Erik (Red Riot Thot): http://dailysnark.com/confirmed-spongebobs-sweet-victory-will-be-performed-during-super-bowl-liii-halftime-show/
