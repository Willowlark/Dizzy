Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just told Chris he radiates big Dave energy
Anna (blonde and sad): How bad is Livingston NJ
Anna (blonde and sad): for some reason a ton of engineering jobs are there so I keep chucking my indeed resume there
Jess (whoozica): i dont really know, its near the oranges, but its close-ish to me XD
Anna (blonde and sad): The oranges ??
Anna (blonde and sad): I'm like. Seriously debating ditching NY if somewhere in Jersey offers me job. But. Gotta find place to live then lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Livingston is a nice area iirc? I believe my mom worked there at one point.
Anna (blonde and sad): *continues to throw applications*
Anna (blonde and sad): Also I just. Wanna know. Wtf is the Instagram algorithm bc we post nice set up photos tagged to shit and get like 60 likes. I post somethin from last year about wanting warmer weather. And. 270 likes. 
Is it the side boob? Is it the bikini top 
Is this what the people want
Jess (whoozica): probably
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Anna (blonde and sad): I have suddenly remembered why I don't color my hair anymore 
My boether had been in this hair salon for 2+ hours
Anna (blonde and sad): He's getting a cut and color
Anna (blonde and sad): His hair is like. What Erik's was before he cut it. And. 
I wanna leave
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh speaking of hair I need opinions.

I wanna do something different with my hair but I'm afraid of looking strange also my job at a bank
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): mullet
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): business in front party in the back
Georgia (Something Sensible): Could do the undercut that parts one way to show off the undercut, and the other way hides it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): just don't turn too far to the side or else owo
Georgia (Something Sensible): "It is astounding to think that, despite the many strides that humanity has made in physics, we are still so unsure of the dimensions of one of the fundamental building blocks of our universe."
Georgia (Something Sensible): is this awkward phrasing or nag
Georgia (Something Sensible): im writing about the proton radius puzzle
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): "of the dimensions of one..." sounds weird.
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i had a feeling the two "of" was weird
Georgia (Something Sensible): "It is astounding to think that, despite the many strides that humanity has made in physics, we are still so unsure about one of the fundamental building blocks of our universe: the proton. "
Georgia (Something Sensible): better?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ditch the comma after that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~it's supposed to sound fluffy right~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): uhhhhhh no this is for an internship application for next semester
Georgia (Something Sensible): help im drowning in intern apps, even when i thought i was done
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That can be a fluffy thing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But if it's not something that has a word count, you can also say like "Humanity has made many strides in physic, but we are still unsure protons, a fundamental building block of the universe."
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Less words. Same thing.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _in physic_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I got my expensive piece of paper, I don't have to write bullshit anymore*
Georgia (Something Sensible): Humanity has made many strides in physics in the last hundred years. Yet, we are still so unsure about one of the fundamental building blocks of our universe: the proton.
Georgia (Something Sensible): more simple, easier to follow, hopefully the professor doesn't get lost in commas now
Georgia (Something Sensible): is that better?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd drop the so from so unsure.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Other than that yeah.
Georgia (Something Sensible): hella
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i still have years of writing bullshit to go
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Enjoy that thesis.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gord has been blowing off his Doctorate thesis for the last 15 years.
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah isnt there no real limit on how long your PhD can take?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Apparently.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I doubt you'll have the option but non thesis tracks are 👌
Georgia (Something Sensible): i dont really mind writing
Georgia (Something Sensible): when i can get in the zone i can write well and efficiently
Georgia (Something Sensible): NASA internships starting to get back to everyone is just making it hard to focus <:pensivecowboy:444350201998868510>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I always found it boring. I'd rather *do* something with my learning, rather than explain it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I guess it's harder to do something in the natural sciences.
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah physics is a lot of numbers and tech and bullshit
Georgia (Something Sensible): but professors say that writing is just as important
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats how they get the funding for numbers and tech and bullshit 😎
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~but what do you do with those numbers~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): you make more numbers
Georgia (Something Sensible): and test those numbers
Georgia (Something Sensible): rinse and repeat
Mark (Mad Doctor): If a reader gets lost in commas, how many dimensions are they capable of contemplating? 

Took a grant writing workshop back in grad school which could have been titled "How to separate rich people and government agencies from their money". If you're in the sciences, you pretty much have to promise death rays or the cure for cancer
Georgia (Something Sensible): im taking a scientific and technical writing course next semester
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That sounds like _hell_
Georgia (Something Sensible): it apparently starts with writing a resume and ends with writing a 15 page grant proposal
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup, hell.
