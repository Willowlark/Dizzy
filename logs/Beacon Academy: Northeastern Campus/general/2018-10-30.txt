Erik (Red Riot Thot): So there's a girl who frequents the gym I go to and i've only ever seen her on the treadmill... going at a power walking speed... on the highest incline... she was on when I got here and I just finished my workout. I walked by her and saw the timer was up to 50 minutes... at power walking speed... at the highest incline... she burned close to 900 calories according to the treadmill O.o
Jess (whoozica): Dayum
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sounds like hell. Walking is boring.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I really want/need to start going to the gym. But I don't want to have to pay for a membership nor do I want to use my free college gym cause *anxiety of other college students* 😅
Jess (whoozica): ~~all the gyms in my town are mad expensive~~ 😭
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, it's not high school anymore. No one cares about you at the gym.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): In the good way.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I joined Planet Fitness. $10/month isn't bad if you are actually actively going
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Which I've been trying to go 3-4 times a week
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Valid lol. But I feel like a lot of kids at my school still act very high school like XD 
And ahh that's not to bad 🤔 I know my mom thought about us signing up for one together.
Jess (whoozica): Yea I used to go to PF when it was on my way home like a million years ago. I've been debating getting another membership at the one like 20 mins away
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've got a planet fitness membership and I haven't gone since I bought it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Relatable. I feel that's how I'l be XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Part of that is my stupid commute times, but I'm also a lazy shit.
Jess (whoozica): I like working out at the gym ~~just driving there~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Which is everyone's delimma.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I enjoy sitting on my ass too much to want to work out. It takes everything I have to get myself to do so lol. I just really need to force myself more cause I gotta loose these pounds I gained from meds and all the stress of the past year and a half D:
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If it makes a difference, most of the machines you sit to use 🤷 You just have to move your arms or legs 😅
Georgia (Something Sensible): get some cute ass gym clothes
Georgia (Something Sensible): then if anyone stares youll be like "damn right stare at my cute ass clothes"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah that’s a you thing.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I know you guys make fun of my healthy eating habits but like its actually helped a lot, idk how noticeable it was to you guys (I was oblivious lol) but I lost 35 pounds in the last year and a half literally just from eating better, I didn't exercise at all lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We make fun cause we love you ❤ I deff need to sometime like legit message you on what it is you look for and stuff lol. Cause damn I'd love to have a nice figure like you.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): From what i've read, most of right loss comes from eating better
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s entirely that. Weight loss from food, muscles and such fro, the working out.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm I've had many people weight gain mostly comes from what you eat/the calories you take in. And watching how many calories you take in, cutting out sugary stuff helps. ~~which is what I am bad at cause damn I love my sweets~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): and its not like I've given up candy and sweets and stuff, I'm still addicted to them, its just about finding the right brands with the right ingredients lol
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm eating ice cream as I'm typing this XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've mostly been trying to cut back on my food intake and trying to make healthier substitutions.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): thats really what its about my dudes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lost a few pounds, not a lot. But I'm also trying to build muscle so I might br gaining it back from that as well
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What ingredients do you watch out for Monica?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Sugar
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): lol not necessarily
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol obvs. But I know there's other stuff not good for ya
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): ugh Toph just stepped on the enter button, I wanted to type more
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hello my cat friend whomst tried to eat my leggy XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): TLDR if it tastes good it’s bad for you. Or if it’s bread.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Bread makes you fat?! 👀  ~~sorry I just had to lol~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Bread = carbs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It deff does. And pasta sadly 😫
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Too many carbs = bad
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Potatos, pasta, bread. Pretty much staples to most meals, all bad.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sadly yup :\
Marisa (Weeb): i just sprinkled corn over my fried chicken and rice that's healthy right
literally 90% of the food here is bread/rice/pasta
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Learn to like your veggies
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I still eat that, I avoid processed foods and fast food, and I look for healthy brand alternatives to things like chips, bread, dairy, etc
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I love veggies but we don't put them into our meals enough :\
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): the list of things I avoid and why is wayy too long lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I'll DM you privately someday about that XD
Marisa (Weeb): the only veggies cheaper than $5 a bag in japan are potatoes and maybe carrots, but food in general isn't so expensive
america is so fat partially because unhealthy food is cheap and easily accessible
can the cheapest of foods still be considered food
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): not really lol
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): cheap food is usually bad food
Marisa (Weeb): i don't think dollar store candy is even edible
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Yall 
Speaking of cheap food
Jess (whoozica): I try to avoid carbs at least most of the time, during summer  was very strict about it, more recently I've been doing low carb on weekdays and enjoying myself more on weekends our with friends and stuff. I'm focusing on maintaining a health weigbt right now. But yea most weight loss comes from food and then muscles is from workin out. In my experience at least
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Im hungry and hunting for spmething quick and easy to make in my house
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): nah I eat that high end shit 😎
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): And look what i found in my pasta drawer
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): God bless past me for forgetting about this box of mac and cheese
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I appreciate it so much
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Best part is its the expensice cheap mac and cheeee
Marisa (Weeb): and food bank stuff is usually pretty bad. food banks are glorious and wonderful but a majority of the food (at least in nj) is past the expiration date (milk usually has to be consumed super quickly), barely edible (instant mashed potatoes that look and taste like sawdust) and it's all the stuff people hate to eat.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): By which i mean it costs 30 cents to a dollar more thannregular craft
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Oof food bank in the USA is a huge mess its super sad
Marisa (Weeb): yeah <:rip:378273525804433408> the people who work there are nice but the food isn't very nice
Marisa (Weeb): OH and mashed potatoes from good will are horrible
Marisa (Weeb): don't eat those either
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): goodwill has mash potatoes
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ?
Marisa (Weeb): sometimes yeah and they're absolutely disgusting
sometimes also pancake mix
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Food from goodwill sounds concerning...
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): yeahh
Marisa (Weeb): but it's like $.30 a box 🙏
Marisa (Weeb): probably poisons you
Jess (whoozica): ~~mawisa plz don't eat Goodwill potatoes when you come back to America, come to my house I will buy you potatoes and pancake mix~~
Marisa (Weeb): the muffins aren't bad tho i think we got good muffin mix there once
**no this is survival of the fittest i will eat clovers off the lawn before imposing on your generosity**
Marisa (Weeb): chew the leather on your old boots for protein
Jess (whoozica): Mawisa nooooøø
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): annies is a pretty good brand
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): i love annies
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): i personally prefer it way more than kraft
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): but I'm poor so even a 30 cent difference is a lot
Marisa (Weeb): if you're really hurting you might be eligible for a monthly food bank visit, if you live alone and make less than $2000 a month i think that qualifies you for some pantries.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): i'm not that bad haha 
my family supports me since I've switched to commuting instead of living outside the house
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): the goal is to work part time for a bit and save enough to get back out of the house next year
Marisa (Weeb): HALOWEN
Marisa (Weeb): HALLOWENR IT'S HALOWEN
Marisa (Weeb): Y'SAKLL
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Happy Almost Halloweeeen! ~~We already have bare christmas tress up in my house~~
Jess (whoozica): 😱
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My dad was cleaning out the back garage Sunday so decided to get them out a while. I walked in the door and was like the hell?? XD I *love* christmas but yeaa even a bit too early for me lol
Marisa (Weeb): it's hawait what happened to my caps lock
Marisa (Weeb): IT'S HALLOWENR
Marisa (Weeb): HALLWOEEN
Marisa (Weeb): CHRISTMAS CAN WAIT ITS TURN
Marisa (Weeb): HAWAWOWEEN
Marisa (Weeb): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Marisa (Weeb): i'm gonna smash my face into a pumpkin

Georgia (Something Sensible): I just started season three
Georgia (Something Sensible): I just got to “why would you do that to Midoriyas scrotum”
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s the height of anime comedy, everything else can go home
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): When you get to ep 48, let me know. I’ll scream for you
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): HEY GUYS
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So I was looking at the reacts on the poll
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): did you know you can apparently delete other peoples reactions?
Yeah i accidentally did that to one of the reacts, not sure whose
so @everyone  please go double check to make sure your votes are in!
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): This isn't Pennsylvania and I want to include all absentee ballots
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It doesn’t really matter does it Hal?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): nah it doesn't
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 12 became 11
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): but I don't like the idea of accidentally changing results
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If people do they’re own thing, and it still ends up all BNHA, who cares.
snow ( karma chameleon ): I think the vote is Wear Whatever
snow ( karma chameleon ): it also won’t be all bnha!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It was 12 before. Let it be. It’s probably going to be all BNHA anyway, but this way anyone not doing that series won’t feel alienated.
snow ( karma chameleon ): a few people are still doing rwby
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Woot!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You didn’t get to last year.
snow ( karma chameleon ): I haven’t decided yet but I know a few of us are doing rwby, it was talked about
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Thats awesome! 
are you guys going for a team or just kinda mixed bag
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm doing a better version of Christmas Salem lol
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): eyyy nice
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m doing ruby or froppy 🤷‍♀️
ZombieHunter: I still don’t cosplay BNHA so I’m going all RWBY or no cosplay and taking photos
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Why not rwby and photos?
ZombieHunter: Because laziness
ZombieHunter: Naah the real question is how lazy I am
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mood. I just have to manage to not be sick for it.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm sick rn and it sucks, I'm supposed to work 8 to 4 tomorrow and then go to Jason's for Halloween
