Marisa (Mawisa): I bought everything needed for a shrine today so come to my house and pray and give my shrine money pls and thx
Marisa (Mawisa): It‚Äôs an Inari shrine officially blessed by a priestess. Offering box is only big enough for coins so bring gold dollars <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm getting a bumper crop of teacher gifts this year (almost three times what I got last year). Usual assortment of mugs and cookies. In the gift card category, Starbucks is leading Wawa and Dunkin by 2-1-1
Jamie (Jamie): Today i like my job a bit more
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Pizza? üçï
Jamie (Jamie): Yis
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yumm! We're having a little party at my work today too. Unsure what food though xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol y'all help a girl out? Those cat shaped keychains that are used for self defense. What're they called? I can't find them with everything I look up on amazon üò©

Erik (Red Riot Thot): THESE ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY FUCKING COOL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And surprisingly reasonably priced for RT
Matt (mattmyers25): I know we have the flag, but should we get a banner?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Everyone else who has a Katsu balcony room get one and paint "BNE" on it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So today I'm wearing my Beacon shirt and I decided I kind of want all of the academy shirts (plus Shade when it comes out next year I'm assuming) but WHY DOES ATLAS NOT MATCH
