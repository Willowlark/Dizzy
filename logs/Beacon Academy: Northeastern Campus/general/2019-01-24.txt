Georgia (Something Sensible): i was wanted to switch my lab from thurs to monday so i dont have issues going to katsu LOL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I asked him once shouldn't he have a more professional email? His response: "The way I see it, employers would look at my resume and see that I have a bachelor's in engineering, a master's in physics, teach as an adjunct in universities, and have co-written a book about the universe, but oh, his email is *lasermcdoodle*?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): ill just go to another section that week tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): LMAO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Loved this guy
Georgia (Something Sensible): o wow and works for boeing
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats a sweet deal
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is the book. I haven't actually gotten around to reading it but I feel like you'd find it interesting
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeee looks kewl
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): my type of physicist is the physicists that dont take themslves too seriously
Georgia (Something Sensible): my prof says "google" like "cougar"
Georgia (Something Sensible): he keeps asking what a "google" is
Jess (whoozica): 😬
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Is this a meme I don’t know about
Jess (whoozica): W t f
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah it’s from a famous rakugo act
Marisa (Mawisa): Then I guess weebs expanded from there
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Jess (whoozica): Thank God Marisa knows everything 🙏
Marisa (Mawisa): The original story is about a boy who has a really long name and he gets hurt and people are like “hey [name] is really hurt someone go tell his parents” but the name takes so long to say that by the time the news reaches his parents he’s like dead
Marisa (Mawisa): <:rip:378273525804433408>
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Is that what the kids book tiki tiki tembo is based on
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Cuz I loved that book as a kid
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Sounds the same cept the kid barely survives
Jamie (Jamie): Wendys tryin to tempt me with its grease while im at the gym so rude
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😮 apparently Weezer did some more cover songs?? I just hear "scrubs" cover by them on radio and ohhh 👌🏻
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah they dropped the Teal Album which is all covers
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm that's what I heard. Guess I know what I'm listening too when home! 👌🏻
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Why is it that whenever it's slightly warm out, house flies magically spawn in my office out of nowhere?
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH
Georgia (Something Sensible): Noah and I listened to it all last night
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s a mixed bag tbh
Jess (whoozica): OH NO <@!351785752197201920>  were gona get ants again
Marisa (Mawisa): check yer windowsills. flies that you see 'dead' in the winter are actually just hibernating and when the temperature reaches a certain warmth it wakes them up from their hibernation
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yuck D:
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's possible. But anytime there's one buzzing around my window, I smash it and throw it away and then another one takes its place like 10 minutes later
Marisa (Mawisa): they're sending their champions to seek vengeance against you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Zombie flies coming to haunt you 👻
Anna (Cadmium): do you have drains you dumped food down ever?
Anna (Cadmium): apparently i got flies bc we never cleaned the sink drain
Erik (Red Riot Thot): idk but all sinks are on the other side of the building from me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ... I'm so happy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've just trained my phone text replacement to replace `instcap` with `Find this gallery under "Cosplay Photography" on my site (link in the bio) or here: ".
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I never have to type out that stupid phrase every again.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (Doing the same thing would be good if you frequently use a set of hashtags I imagine)
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://lifehacker.com/get-help-waking-up-with-these-quirky-alarm-clock-apps-1832014140
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've use alarmy before. Evil little bastard.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): how did you do that Bill?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): trained your phone
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Still losing me
Jess (whoozica): I think you program it under dictionary settings
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ooooh. That.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, for IOS it's under keyboar settings.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): `Settings > Language and input > Google Keyboard > Text correction > Personal Dictionary`
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it's the same thing that corrects `i` to `I`.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ooooh neat I have something similar on my Samsung. It's called text shortcuts
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, it's one of those things everyone has to do differently but the same.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): NEAT
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Just added one for my Taiyang tags
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that'll be so fucking convenient lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I know*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I liked posting regular photos better *just* because of that.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): especially when tagging for Kirishima because of different spellings and name order
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd like to use it that way, but I post so much variety it'd be hard...
Jess (whoozica): i copy and paste from a google doc
Jess (whoozica): ~~but i just realized some are spelled wrong~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~big shocker i know~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you made that doc on the way home from Katsu last year, I'm not surprised.
Jess (whoozica): LOL YEA, time to revise
Jess (whoozica): oof i should really do actual work....
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I should get in the habit of tagging BNE things.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'm also still stuck on the card thing Anna brought up the other day and making BNE trading cards~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ok, so we can all agree that despite what Facebook says, they *definitely* listen to your conversations right? I'm listening to one of the RT shows through Spotify and they did an ad read for MVMT watches. I open up Facebook on my phone and there's an ad for MVMT watches...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They... do.
Jess (whoozica): ye def
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanted to drop messenger a few weeks ago for this reason.
Jess (whoozica): i told tom i wanted oreos like 6 times on tuesday, wednesday, OREO ADS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But you can't 'just drop' a social media, cause then you alone on the new network.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanna use Signal, cause end to end encryption.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Just turned off mic permissions on both apps. See if that does anything
Georgia (Something Sensible): that BNE trading cards is cute as an idea but it would need to have like... a purpose
Georgia (Something Sensible): or i dont think people would really buy
Jess (whoozica): I like the intro profile idea, could maybe combine them?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you think regular trading cards have purpose?~~ The baseball card kind exist just to have one.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye, do like a blurb, instagram handle (can replace cards) and Idk, do a shout out on the BNE account for anyone who meets all 30 members and gets their card.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *oooh, like an arg*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yo... we can use them like business cards
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk if people would BUY cosplayer collector cards, but i think its cute idea to start doing with cosplay business cards
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): get people to ya know, actually keep them, and look at them
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): both group promotion and individual promotion.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ ye
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Need someone artistic to make a frame for em. *<@!351471675843411978> 👀*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd image... a bordered image on one side, with a spot for instagram handle in the border... then other side is centered with the BNE logo, with an open (rwby) scroll type text box to be filled in.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *too bad you can't photograph imagination*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *cause I can't art it out*
Jess (whoozica): becuase its an instagram post tho it gotta be square
Jess (whoozica): well i guess it doesnt have to be square, but can it be business card ratio?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): well, we were talking card sized for business cards too.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah absolutely should be that ration.
Jess (whoozica): but does insta take that ratio?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Could do a variant which is square though!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Insta posts can be any ratio, stories need to be... 16:9.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Vista print cards are 3.5" by 2".
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): which is... an aspect ratio.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 1.5:1?
Jess (whoozica): 1.586 technically?
Jess (whoozica): its print so it doesnt exactly translate to an aspect ratio
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.pokecard.net/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 👀
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): little different look there lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, Insta stories vary based on your phone's aspect ratio ☝
Erik (Red Riot Thot): my phone is a long boi so the sides of people's stories often get clipped for me :/
Jess (whoozica): ye, like i cant read peoples sometimes cuz they go off my screen
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Last I read it was 1920x1080... cause otherwise higher ratio images would be cropped and lower would have blank borders.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): nani the fuck.
Jess (whoozica): yea top and bottoms of eriks go byebye for me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~oh well instagram a poorly developed platform anyway~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): for me it's the sides
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My aspect ratio is 18.5:9
Anna (Cadmium): Idk what chat this would be in but. Eventually. I want to actually finish the RWBY tarot deck I was coming up with sketches n stuff for. I put it on hold cause so much content came this season that I can reference. But! I want to actually do this. I want to do all the major and minor arcana which is daunting
Anna (Cadmium): Some of the stuff I came up with is like. Obvious. Like Sun is gonna be the sun. Qrow is the hanged man
Anna (Cadmium): But I need help for a bunch if others
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I like helping
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ozpin and Salem as Emperor and Empress? Ironwood as the Tower?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Ughhhh <@289944569410224129>  I have my card reader Salem planned because of the RWBY tarot project on tumblr! Please do it
