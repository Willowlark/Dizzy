Marisa (Weeb): the gum was caffinated so since the project was due in like 3 hours and it was the wee hours of the morning, they chewed the entire book-sized box of gum at once. it was disgusting there was drool everywhere but ANYWAY they finish the report and start firing up the printer. can't walk at this point so they're rolling across the floor like a corn cob dropped at a barbecue. as he's flacizing the paper and trying to get it out of the cabinet, i guess all the exhaustion and caffine and expired baumkuchen they shoved down their gullet finally takes its toll and he starts casimuning on the satice. Clarice was there watching with her noundecescons balanced on the captural    and she can't stop degranging the kontle rhymorts. 

got a 87% on that report though yo he was everyone's hero that day

There’s a simulator here that simulates a 9.0 and it’s horrifying (both on the ground and in a skyscraper because they’re totally different shakes). But also fun afterwards when it stops.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Consciousness consists of psionic wave oscillations of quantum energy. “Quantum” means a refining of the non-local and an unfolding of the ethereal.. Today, science tells us that the essence of nature is will. Chi requires exploration. By flowering, we vibrate. Nothing is impossible. Spacetime is the driver of peace. You and I are travellers of the quantum soup. Turbulence is the antithesis of science. We can no longer afford to live with suffering. Where there is suffering, flow cannot thrive.

By condensing, we reflect. Coherence is the driver of truth. Consciousness consists of chaos-driven reactions of quantum energy. If you have never experienced this vision on a cosmic scale, it can be difficult to believe. Being, look within and unify yourself. It can be difficult to know where to begin. We are in the midst of an archetypal redefining of science that will enable us to access the nexus itself. Reality has always been electrified with dreamweavers whose bodies are opened by flow. Without hope, one cannot self-actualize. Throughout history, humans have been interacting with the cosmos via molecular structures. We are at a crossroads of potentiality and desire. Humankind has nothing to lose. We exist as supercharged electrons. You and I are dreamers of the multiverse. Interconnectedness is the healing of awareness, and of us.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Mark (Mad Doctor): <@301927856240459777> will be proud
