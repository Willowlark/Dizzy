Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): but that's like the first law of nature, y'know? you never eat random mushrooms. ain't he ever played a video game or watched a movie? smh. so they cook all these mushrooms that they harvested in the yingham by boiling it in some big rik with salt and pepper and leaves and whatnot. and they boil it *all day*. it's basically mushroom soup by the time they're done, but not soup because it isn't soupy. you know what i mean. now at this point it's been almost six hours since the wasps came by and wasps aren't very fond of gantin if it's been out for  a while
