Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm watching the Darlifra dub and thought Dr. Franxx sounded familiar. He's the same VA who voices Father/the narrator in FMA:B
Matt (mattmyers25): How cringey is the dub?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Very
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The word "darling" doesn't sound good in English lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The only characters whose voices I find comparable to the original is Zorome and Kokoro
Matt (mattmyers25): Nice lol
Marisa (Mawisa): what is UP
Marisa (Mawisa): so there are videos of monkeys petting cats and dogs but do you think monkeys would use their feet to also pet other animals
humans generally tend not to because feet are associated with dirt and movement and we use our hands for everything but is it the same with monkeys? ??
what about octopi do they even have tentacles that they consider legs or are they all categorized as the same. do octopi and squid have a dominant tentacle like we have dominant hands.
Marisa (Mawisa): turns out octopi have a dominant eye which may or may not be linked to a dominant tentacle.
no updates on the monkeys.
does anybody wear those socks that have separate spots for each of your toes? like a glove but it's a sock?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!351785752197201920> wears those funky toe socks lol
Marisa (Mawisa): wow that's freaky
see it's so weird that people find it notable
do you prefer them over regular socks
do you think if they had been the norm when socks were invented that now we would all be wearing toe-separating socks
Marisa (Mawisa): do people prefer mittens or gloves
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay but if toe separating socks were the norm instead of regular socks people like me and Erik would be screwed XD
Marisa (Mawisa): do you have four toes :0
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD Webbed toes
Marisa (Mawisa): omg that's cool ur a mercreature
Marisa (Mawisa): so do you ever pet animals with your feet?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Four toes I'm screaming omg XDD 
And lol I mean... sometimes I do so to my dog when I'm at the table and don't feel like bending over to do so
Marisa (Mawisa): i saw a cat once with like 8 fingers on one paw i really wanted to high......... high five? high eight?? i wanted to slap my hand gently against its paw in a bro-like fashion
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lol mercreatures. Yes. You found out our hidden secret! XD
Marisa (Mawisa): pool cosplay time
Marisa (Mawisa): why don't we pet fish more often
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My ex had a polydactyl cat. Freaking weird but she was a sweet cat
Marisa (Mawisa): you ever pet an otter? they're very soft.
do octopi have a set number of suckers on their tentacles like we have fingers
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wish to pet an otter. They so freakin' cute.
Marisa (Mawisa): would otters wear toe socks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg :3
Marisa (Mawisa): i wonder what life would be like if penguins were still 7 feet tall and megafauna was still around
Marisa (Mawisa): ur drivin to the bank when u hit this with your car wyd
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG. I think you just fucked if you hit that XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Nothing because you're dead
Marisa (Mawisa): "hey boss i'm gonna be a bit late to work today"
Marisa (Mawisa): in high school during our driver's ed final one of the questions was "you're driving on a thin mountain road at night and are going around a curve when you spot a possum in the road. there is a steep cliff on one side and an approaching car on the other. you are going too fast to stop. what do you do?"
one of the kids passed because he made the possum 7 feet big since they never specified its size
Marisa (Mawisa): would we even have cars if there were 7ft possums at our disposal
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay my thought though is... why are you going to fast to stop on a *thin mountain road, at night... on a curve* ?!
Marisa (Mawisa): you crave that mountain mineral
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I MISS THAT FUCKING MEME
Erik (Red Riot Thot): #BEINGBACKTHATMINERAL2K19
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like if you going that fast on that type of road to stop for a possum... you gonna get done fucked up at some point soo
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <@!301927856240459777> I do prefer them over regualr socks
Tom (tomukuncosplay): i have more control over each toe and its v. comf
Marisa (Mawisa): do wearing toe socks affect your driving in any way
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Truth. I don't think I've ever seen Tom wear normal socks XD
Tom (tomukuncosplay): like sometimes in my shoes i wish i could separate my toes
Marisa (Mawisa): rebecca comes over every day like "what socks we got today?"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Wishes I could just separate my toes in general... lol~~

Tom (tomukuncosplay): as long as its first person view
