Evie (Katheryne Knight): Good morning everyone -u-
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <:mew_face:498919883766235137>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): “Good” :3c
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly that's a mood
Marisa (Weeb): Konban wa minasan
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It is the morning
Marisa (Weeb): Then why is it dark
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Whether or not it is "good" is debatable
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Mood
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Mood morning
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think I just ran over a squirrel and now I'm upset
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Today sucks already
Jess (whoozica): I just spent the first half hour of my day looking at ex-president's dogs <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Our internet and intranet just crapped out so I can't connect to the internet or access any files on our server. Guess I can't do any work today ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Your phone still works!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Time for FanFiction!
Marisa (Weeb): why fanfiction when you can discover ~a new series~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm just doing what I was doing before which was dicking around in Solidworks making things to 3D print
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh yeah you were doing that.
Jamie (Jamie): I'm torn between asking my boss if i can just leave since im not really that needed today aside from doing busywork that is done in minutes. But that also means losing a days pay so i mean that would suck a whole 40 bucks lost.
Jamie (Jamie): Damn just made myself hate this work more thinking of how i make shit doing it lmao yay american economy 🎊
Jess (whoozica): where do you work jamie?
Jamie (Jamie): A t shirt sceeenprinting place but its small so boss man dont pay much even the graphic designer is overworked and underpaid. So me the shop assistant essencially is severely underpaid. 8.50/hr does not pay the bills well
Jess (whoozica): oh yea 😦  screen printing is cool, but yikes
Jamie (Jamie): Im in the process of trying to get an admitistrative assistant job since i enjoy organizer and all the tedious stuff no else tends to like
Jess (whoozica): i didnt realise PA's min wage was still 7.25 😱
Jess (whoozica): do you at least like the people you work with? or not so much
Jamie (Jamie): Yup it is...wait its not elsewhere i know it varies but honestly
Jamie (Jamie): And I have a total of 3 coworkers and that includes my boss/the owner
Jamie (Jamie): I like the owner and graphic designer but the printer can be a dick
Jess (whoozica): NJ's 8.60, CA's is like 11 or something D:
Jamie (Jamie): That makes sense i could certainly pay more bills and not feel like a moocher on that pay
Jess (whoozica): federal min wage is 7.25 so all states have to be at least that
Jess (whoozica): ours changed to 8.25 from 7,25 a few years ago and then 8.60 in january
Jess (whoozica): part time or full?
Jamie (Jamie): False full time work the hours non of the benefits
Jamie (Jamie): Work 9 to 5 but since lunch aint paid its only 7 hrs
Jess (whoozica): gotcha, the good ol 39.99 hours trick?
Jamie (Jamie): No idea i mean i chose my hours so
Jess (whoozica): nah im jk, alot of places like to do that though they keep you just under the 40 hr mark
Jamie (Jamie): There were some perks of this work mainly chose the hours and no weekends im treated like a human being just not paid like one
Jess (whoozica): yea 😦
Jamie (Jamie): I know what you mean tho back when i worked Wendy's they were really harsh not letting anyone even a second over 27 hrs worked
Jess (whoozica): oh yea def a friend of mine used to lierally get 39.5 hours a week and then they would cuz her off
Jess (whoozica): cuz if she did 40 they'd have to offer health insurance
Jamie (Jamie): Yup that soynds about right haha
Jess (whoozica): 😭
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I am a man of many names
Matt (mattmyers25): Is anyone here good with fixing computers? I have a dell that the ram stick may of popped put and needs to be put back in
Marisa (Weeb): Did you try turning it off and on again
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ram is very easy to remove.
Matt (mattmyers25): Yes I did
Marisa (Weeb): I hear you can download more RAM for free online if you’re running low
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead):

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Welp.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, they’re a unique bunch. They filled potholes or something like that for charity didn’t they? Might as well be legitimate.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Soooo Porntreon?
Jess (whoozica): They actually seem to do alot of charity type stuff? They have college scholarships and donate to save the whales and stuff
Jamie (Jamie): I mean its literally people from years of brainwashing that the body is dirty and so is porn too therefore nothing related to it is good.
Jamie (Jamie): The world getting "woke" is honestly amusing. Though with things like this and also the xase of satanism sueing the new sabrina show making people go wtf thought you guys blah blah blah but your not?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just want pornhub to be a household name.
Jamie (Jamie): 👆
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *'oh yeah, I saw that clip on pornhub'
'lol reblogging that to pornhub'
'did I link you to my pornhub?'
'I've got this great pornhub playlist I listen to at work'*

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I just want to watch the world burn~~
Jamie (Jamie): Honestly i can see it becoming a thing not gonna lie
Jamie (Jamie): Also i want to add posting art to an audience woth a large percetage wanting to complete activites is a brilliant buisness plan for artists doing pieces to cater to such customers because people are not in the right state of mind and are mor likely to pay to see more of the art
Jess (whoozica): "complete activities" <:lenny:456549338026344489>
