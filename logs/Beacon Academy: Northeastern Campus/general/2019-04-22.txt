Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao I am farrr from being able to afford but hoping if I watch my spending I can do so soon. Gonna try not to spend anythign at cpac this weekend, push commissions and items getting rid of more. Just see what I can do. Hoping we get more hours next month too if sales are up. I also think imma limit my cons this summer so i can move out. I mean they're offering to work with me on rent sooo we shall see
Matt (mattmyers25): Just saw a van full of amish get into an accident. I thought they only drove horse and buggies
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They often times have people drive them around if going far places or going to get lots of things they can't fit int their buggy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): menenite also drive
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ That too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk if i spelt that wrong
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but you know
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mennonite do drive indeed. And they are often mistaken for Amish sooo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~well some do at least~~
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i knew someone who would drive the amish around to the library and stuff, they had a van with automatic doors that fascinated them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee a lot of the amish that come into my work get their via people with vans who drive them around. Lots of people do that for a job lol. Amish taxi services XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Apparently my grandmother on my dad's side was a Mennonite who was shunned. Sounds a lot cooler than it was. She was a mean old lady who covered her furniture in vinyl
Jamie (Jamie): I mean in some levels of mennonite  you could be shunned because you bought food from the wrong store or the wrong brand so
