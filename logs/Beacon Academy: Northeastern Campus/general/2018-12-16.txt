Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Comics are fucking terrible to read. They keep bouncing storylines between different series.

ZombieHunter: soooooooooo
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was really into the X Men comics in the 90s, but I decided to give it up when I realized I needed to buy about ten titles to follow a single storyline. A shame, since there were some epic stories back then.
