Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leanna is innocent!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mag spent all day with...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Hunter!*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): She's sad I'm not roasting her on Twitter bc she doesn't know how to use discord and can't defend herself
ZombieHunter: She did no such thing
ZombieHunter: I did photatos all day
ZombieHunter: Mag got stuck with a guy who talked about his OCs for two hours and <@!327835140216586242>  has to save her.

ZombieHunter: Not a clue :3
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *leanna appears to*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): didn't you say it was the Ghira guy?
ZombieHunter: She was with the Ghira guy but the annoying one wasn’t the Ghira guy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the trident guy?
ZombieHunter: Maybe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was def the trident guy
ZombieHunter: Idk. Meg saved her. Lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i had to yeet away from him
ZombieHunter: 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the blue person xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SHES BLUE DABA DEE BADA DIE
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *THE BLUE PERSON*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): That sounds. ominous
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *just go with the tiefling*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeaaaaaah Trident guy followed like, all of us after the shoot.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fucking yikes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wait whats his name
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like username
Anna (loud and likely blonde): uh
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ghira guy was really nice. The OC guy...well, let's just say he liked his Mary Sue a whole lot and had to share his intricate backstory with everyone. He was requesting photos w all the female characters because, you know, part of his story
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hes not a bad guy, but just...... no social cues , and WAY too into his OC
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok so its *not* the guy who commented "Hot daddy" on mag's aizawa pic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeaaaaah After the cinder one I was like 'nope no thank you I didn't hear your request'.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): `beserker_byakko` is his username. ALSO have his real name. It's the guy who tried to friend everyone on the going list for the rwby shoot.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Especially bc the Ooblek guy who showed up late had a legit request
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~yep hes following us~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): F
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeaaaah... I meant everyone.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i feel bad cause i always wanna teach these ppl social cues to be less. '"'creeper"'' and or annoying but
Anna (loud and likely blonde): also thats dangerous
Mark (Mad Doctor): Based on a long family history, I'm gonna bet that he's on the Autism spectrum. Lots of times ASD people are mortified to learn they've transgressed social norms. Other times they can be grateful for the gentle correction. And other times they can get defensive. So...yeah. no real rules or guidelines
Georgia (Something Sensible): He thanked me for running the shoot because it made him “the happiest since his mom killed herself”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I was like ohhhh gosh I can’t say I’m sorry and thank you and glad you had fun in the same breath
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *oof*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh my god
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *how does one even respond to that*
Georgia (Something Sensible): It was just a very TMI message for someone he just met
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that's the dude that commented on the selfie of you and me right <@245270932602486784> ?

Cause I saw his comment and was like "Okay..??" 

Like I'm VERY much into my DnD characters and what not but he reminds me of someone I role played with back in the day who was super bad news. Which sucks cause I don't want to be an asshole, but my guard is up.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yupppp
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like OCs are valid! But there can be such a thing as too far? 

Idk I feel like I sound like an ass
Anna (loud and likely blonde): nah u right its like, the overshare in a place where it wasn't asked for is the problem
Anna (loud and likely blonde): not the OC
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Right yeah!
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~side note that selfie of u and georgia is adorable~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THANK OWO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You don't go to cons to serve as a life coach for people who need social skills. It feels right to want to help people, but at the same time you aren't required to do it and you shouldn't have to.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but yeah its the oversharing like. u wanna talk oc's lets GO but like if u wanna just talk to ppl about things and it turns into a 3 hour presentation on your oc. it turns someone into an unwilling listener to something they didnt wanna listen to if they are not participant in the convo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes. Like I love talking about my DnD characters, but unless it's on the topic, I'm not gonna be like "Here is a 3 hour case study of my trifling bard with depression, oppression, and daddy issues!"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But once again if he is on the ASD spectrum, he wouldn't quite understand that. 

Ugh I like can't word anything cause I feel like an ass but I can't convey my words?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): english hard emotions large
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Exactly
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but yes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My emotions are so large David Cage wishes his game had this much emotion.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): damn
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~i could literally go on a 2 hour rant on how much of a hack David Cage is but like I'm not gonna cause this isn't the time or place XD~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i do not know . whomst that is.
ZombieHunter: LOL
ZombieHunter: Is that w uhhh
ZombieHunter: Not this guy is it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO who dis?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nope.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i forgot i gave everyone little descriptions while i was drunk in case u changed ur names on here and i just wanna talk to drunk me bc . theyre interesting~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao oh boy.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am curious to know what they are now XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ...yours is LIPSTICK IN MY VALENTINO WHITE BAG???!?!?1
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMAOOOOO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): what, like in the discord note?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~share~~
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~share~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the train of thought was "why is bill's color grey" so i clicked and the question is still unanswered but i saw the note on ur name bill
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Bill's is Mr. Salt Shaker
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ooof.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Marisa yours is "Yanno, like 'Nyah!'
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is that like Mr brightside?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i meant more like u are the saltiest
Marisa (Mawisa): jinx webecca <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): shouldve been Salt King
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm running with *Alpha Leo* cause it annoys other Leos.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~also at some point I should try not being defined by a technically negative personality trait like being salty~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lmao no i mean i should have put salt king in the note not Mr. Salt Shaker
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): whats mine
Anna (loud and likely blonde): not that ur role
Jess (whoozica): whats mine?!

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Probs from ice skating when she yeeted us her rwby wigs to be rwby charas lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): possibly
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im still salty my orange wig is now destroyed
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *sigh(

Marisa (Mawisa): even tho it's destroyed she makes a nice emma ;u;
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lol thank. it needs. some SERIOUS HELP now though. like i could fix some bits but its forever an emma wig
Marisa (Mawisa): did they have permission to cut it up? or were they just borrowing it and decided "hey let me chop this"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i put it on her and we were trimming it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i did say she could cut it but like. she went to town on the back instead of leaving it as one should leave a wig
Anna (loud and likely blonde): soooooooooo its forever an emma wig because there's no way to make it anyone else
Marisa (Mawisa): hinata!!! my emma wig is a actually a hinata wig. so it's at least 2 characters. 👀
Anna (loud and likely blonde): whomst
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Haikyuu Hinata..?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): whelp i permanently gave it to her so i guess. it hers now
Anna (loud and likely blonde): she does read haikyuu i think

Marisa (Mawisa): yee haikyuu boi
Anna (loud and likely blonde): So yea its gone to me. F
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i got. one personal use out of it lmfao
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I just spent twenty minutes explaining to my coworker that a Boeing dreamliner and an airbus a320 are not the same plane
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 😂😂 why
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Idk he literally couldn't wrap his head around it. I think the dreamliner is the one that keeps having problems but like. He's like how do I tell what flight I'm in and I'm like it should say the plane on your booking
Anna (loud and likely blonde): He's like ok it says flight X on airbus A320 
I'm like. Ok you're on an airbus a320 he's like how can you tell it's different 
I'm like. Because airbus is not Boeing???
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I took two dreamliners when going to Europe the other week. Also if you mean the ones that crashed this month and back in October that's the Boeing max
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yea the one that just had to make an emergencg landing 
He's not. The most aware coworker
Anna (loud and likely blonde): But still he's like not understanding airbus and Boeing are different companies and it's weird
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 😂
