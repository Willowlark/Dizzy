Georgia (Something Sensible): gasp ill do yours for you marisa
Marisa (Weeb): I just went to the mobile site! The app is super shady. But thank you!! <3
My top posts are the only things I’ve uploaded that aren’t cosplay rip I should give it
Marisa (Weeb): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): damn you have some nice variety
Marisa (Weeb): I’m throwing all my cosplay out the window as we speak
Georgia (Something Sensible): mAWISA NO
Marisa (Weeb): Time to become a travel blog
Marisa (Weeb): idk it does kind of hurt having my lowest effort posts be the top ones but also it’s fascinating
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Shh all of your posts are fantastic Marisa. I love seeing the costumes as well as all the coolio stuff you're doing in Japan :3 ~~
Marisa (Weeb): They’re free on the ground! Come get them! It’s raining tho be careful of slipping and maybe bring an umbrella and water proof bag to put them in. Stop by for some tea and cookies also
Marisa (Weeb): We can get anime fried chicken and jello let’s go the store is open 24/7 but they might sell out if we don’t hurry
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anime fried chicken XD What
Marisa (Weeb): [moana voice] it calls me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol Japan is wild...
Marisa (Weeb): Ghhhh hh I just realized the toothpick is on the box and I ate it with my hands like a savage because I didn’t see the toothpick on the box
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They come with toothpicks to eat the chicken with??
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah!! Do you think people just eat the chicken with their hands like savages like me? Nah, they’re refined. Fancy.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol Japan be classy... and yet here in America we're just a bunch of savages XD
Marisa (Weeb): I bought French fries yesterday and the lady asked if I wanted chopsticks so I don’t get my dainty fingers tainted by potato. Heaven forbid. Hamburgers and steamed buns also come in little paper bags to hold them as you eat them because apparently your hands can never come into contact with food ever.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 too classy for me lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lemme just devour my food my food like an animal 😂😂

Jamie (Jamie): Gonna have to bring back the old cosplan of being tohru and all the girls honestly
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH

Jamie (Jamie): Yes always
Marisa (Weeb): like 9 years ago at a con some girls called me a lazy tohru cosplayer when I was just wearing a white shirt and blue skirt. ok.jpg
Jamie (Jamie): Lol wow
Marisa (Weeb): [puts on cat ears] i'm lazy simba from the lion king
Jamie (Jamie): That moment people forget some people are at con and not in cosplay of any kind
Jamie (Jamie): You mean from the new lion king <:imdyingsquirtle:378261448838610944>
Marisa (Weeb): [walks up to someone in jeans and a band t-shirt] wow nice goku cosplay but you should really get a wig
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is it harder to find a series you haven't cosplayed than a series you have Mawisa?
Jamie (Jamie): *mawisa*
Jess (whoozica): MAWISA 🙌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Have we never called Mawisa Mawisa in BNE?
Marisa (Weeb): hewwo
mmmaybe? there's lots i haven't cosplayed from.
You'll be much more hard pressed to find an anime or manga i've never heard of.
Marisa (Mawisa): my friend has a game where she takes me to animate and points at random series on the shelves and I tell her what it's about
Marisa (Mawisa): MY NAME
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Why am I tempted to name off series to see just how many Marisa has cosplayed from lol~~
Marisa (Mawisa): I AM A WEEB NO MORE
Marisa (Mawisa): do it :3c
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LOL
Marisa (Mawisa): name! name! name! name!
Marisa (Mawisa): did you do your presentation yet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Marisa has a (multipage) master list.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): FMA, Trigun, Spice and Wolf, AKB0048, Toradora, Tiger and Bunny, Devil is a Part Timer, Kill La Kill, FLCL XXXHolic... uhhhhhh XD

And lol yes. Did I do well? Idk XD I stuttered and rushed through it kinda sooo
Marisa (Mawisa): my cosplay list is 3 pages single spaced and canon outfits only
ooooo nice list lemme see
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMAO damn. I thought mint was long...
Marisa (Mawisa): I haven't officially cosplayed FMA but i did try to get together Winry for an event here so I have a partial Winry cosplay (wig/shirt/skirt, no boots or jacket).
not trigun sadly although I did win a trivia contest once thanks to a trigun question
I've cosplayed Holo from Spicey Wolf
not AKB0048 but i totally considered it because bodyline has their outfits for pretty cheap
not tiger and bunny sadly. if i get a sponsor maybe...... <:lenny:456549338026344489>
actually now that I think about it I have everything but the wig to cosplay Emi from devil is a part timer
Haven't done Kill la Kill but I've been told I should cosplay Ryuko, I wanna do Nonon
not FLCL rip i wish
not xxxholic but I did make a Mokona plush and almost cosplayed cardcaptor sakura
Marisa (Mawisa): should i update my cosplay list and post it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We found some series she does know but hasn't cosplayed from. Mwhahaha 🙌🏻😂
Jess (whoozica): find something she doesnt know
Jess (whoozica): thats hard mode
Marisa (Mawisa): ^^
Marisa (Mawisa): if you can honestly find a series i've never heard of that will be very impressive
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao I'm not even going to try that xD I'm sure everything I know of she's heard of
Marisa (Mawisa): my least favorite anime is wandaba style. absolute garbage.
Marisa (Mawisa): the dub voices are ok the show just sucks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): lol never even heard of it 😮
Marisa (Mawisa): i got the DVD as part of a crunchyroll sale. they used to have awesome 40 for $40 boxes where they'd mail you 40 different DVDs for $40 and it was a good way to try out new shows.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh that's neat 😮
Marisa (Mawisa): anything i don't know would most likely be an OVA from the 70s or 80s that's hard to find anymore and has very few fans, like the Golden Bat anime that nobody can find whole episodes of anymore.
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~someone pls try me because i wanna find new series~~
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Anyone else get their top Spotify of 2018?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~how you do this, imma do it when home~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): spotify sent me an email about it
Georgia (Something Sensible): im surprised miike snow is my top but also not surprised Carnivore is the most listened to song
Georgia (Something Sensible): its so damn _catchy_
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://spotifywrapped.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=wrapped&utm_campaign=2018q4_markets_single_cproductmarketing_holiday
Georgia (Something Sensible): perhaps that link works?
Jess (whoozica): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hold me down.... motion city soundtrack?

Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): daymu
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My "favorite artist" is the guy who does the Minecraft soundtrack 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I listened to him for 522 hours... most of which were while sleeping
Jess (whoozica): ~~hozier owns my ass~~
Marisa (Mawisa): are there even 522 hours in a year
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean i started using amazon music like halfway through the year so this isnt 100% accurate but ..still
Georgia (Something Sensible): I listened to mostly Aries
Jess (whoozica): OO good stuff
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There are 8760 hours in a year
Marisa (Mawisa): how much do y'all pay for spotify?
Georgia (Something Sensible): we just a bunch of rock and indie kidz
Georgia (Something Sensible): i pay student spotify yipppee
Jess (whoozica): 9.99 a month i think
Georgia (Something Sensible): 4.99 for students
Jess (whoozica): i used to have the sudent discont 😭
Marisa (Mawisa): oo that's pretty neat then. i was disappointed when my free trial ended but i didn't like the songs it kept suggesting
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel like its worth it, even for 10 dollars, cause its an entire music database at your disposal
Marisa (Mawisa): now i use youtube playlists like  a scrub
Jess (whoozica): yea exactly
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Spotify Premium has been one of my most useful investments
Marisa (Mawisa): u make it sound so cool
Jess (whoozica): i cant use youtube in da car and i hate ads
Georgia (Something Sensible): you can go from 🎵 country roads take me home 🎵 to 🎵 CRAWLING IN MY SKIN 🎵
Erik (Red Riot Thot): although I have Amazon Prime which gives me access to their music library as well (which is bigger) but I still like Spotify better
Georgia (Something Sensible): i find amazon prime isnt as friendly to use
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Plus it's currently the only music player that can link with Waze so that's convenient as well
Marisa (Mawisa): youtube on the phone is annoying but on my computer there's an adblocker 👌
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yea amazon has the youtuber music i like xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Agreed
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~and discord so i can stalk all your music choices~~
Marisa (Mawisa): when i drove and wanted music I would just put on a really long song medley on youtube but it would be very quiet because driving is scary and i need to hear as much as possible
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Amazon is how I finally listened to RWBY Vol 5 soundtrack since it's still not up on Spotify
Jess (whoozica): if i dont have music on when i drive igo nuts
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have apple music, cause I need to be able to upload my personal library of ~~weeb~~ music.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though I may switch to our NAS drive, personal cloud.
Marisa (Mawisa): on youtube i can listen to the same song sung by 20 different people. variety is the spice of life.
Marisa (Mawisa): all in a row
Jess (whoozica): ~~the only think i listen to on youtube is MM songs~~
Marisa (Mawisa): there's a rendition of a song i would listen to all the time 2 years ago and it was so good. so much better than the original and i can't find it anywhere rip
Jamie (Jamie): So i was just able to watch the trailer for new fruits baskets and i am full on hyped now it looks so beautiful
