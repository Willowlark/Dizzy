Georgia (Something Sensible): facebook apparently got rid of the option for the audience to add options on a poll
Georgia (Something Sensible): in the last two months or so
Georgia (Something Sensible): so if i wanna make a poll for a shoot i need to add EVERY character manually
Rebecca (madameterralupus): oof. That's lame D:
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah thats why i made a poll and deleted it in the CCE rwby event lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): cause making a comment thread is honestly easier at that point
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah I noticed that too for one of the polls you posted
Mark (Mad Doctor): I guess the shared spreadsheet is still an option
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's Marisa isn't it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Marisa or Tom, but I bet Marisa.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I think your right <:pewish:420824457918152704>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Apparently Rooster Teeth is releasing a shirt tomorrow that says "salty" >.> *cough* <@!184437198865563648> *cough*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *unless it says 'we're sorry we made you so salty' I'll have none of it.*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Erik (slendergiant): It's actually v good. You guys are gonna like it 👌🏻
you want fucking rwby chibi?: yikes adam
Erik (slendergiant): I know, but it gives his character more depth
Erik (slendergiant): Which is very much needed
you want fucking rwby chibi?: more depth,,, to being a dick?
Georgia (Something Sensible): MORE DICK
Mark (Mad Doctor): Does it wrap up his story arc? Because I really don't want him in Volume 6.
Erik (slendergiant): you'll have to wait to find out 😉
you want fucking rwby chibi?: <:eyeshmmm:460578402987147264>
Mark (Mad Doctor): As long as he gets kicked in the nards, I'm cool
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): IMO they shouldn’t write him out of the show. He’s a dick, but he’s one of the best villains in the show right now.
Erik (slendergiant): *~~mini spoiler but you get to see him while he's not wearing his mask~~*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): its so good  real talk
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): the short is A+
Mark (Mad Doctor): Looking forward to it. Given how powerless and humiliated he was at the end of volume five, I'm curious as to how he is going to remain a viable villain.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~fixing rwbys crapshoot writing?~+
