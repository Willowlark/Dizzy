Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Maybe it will match Shade?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *maybe...*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I'm still trash enough to buy it~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Maybe I'll hold off on Atlas until it goes on sale. Haven is currently half off
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Not that it matters for you so much
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Beware though, the white is super see through
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I cant really wear mine because the fabric is so thin that you can see straight through it and my bras just OUT in the open
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Noted
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Not to sound weird, but do you have any light gray bras you could wear under it? I know from wearing suits that light gray is a good undershirt color to wear under thin white shirts (e.g. dress shirts)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Might work for bras and white t-shirts?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I dont unfortunately, but even the skin tone ones show through it lmao! So when I wear it I have to wear a tank underneath
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Which isnt a huge deal but it's less comfortable
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 🤷‍♀️
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Gotcha
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah, that's why gray is better
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pastels are a mistake. ~~White isn’t a pastel but light colors in general~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I just say we buy a few more of our own flags and hang them lol

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Live action bnha!!
Marisa (Mawisa): lol Mineta
Marisa (Mawisa): 2.5D Todoroki is in his old hero suit so it’s probably just a recap of the first season
Marisa (Mawisa): Ye deku has his helmet too
Tokoyami looks pretty iffy but Aoyama is spot on good for him
Marisa (Mawisa): Wait but Hatsumei is in the cast list. Hm. Unless she’s just doing a cameo or they’re reworking the story to have her doing something costume related.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m intrigued to see how they do shoji
Marisa (Mawisa): Shoji isn’t in it <:rip:378273525804433408> neither is Sero or Koda but Shinso is
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ugh rude
Marisa (Mawisa): No good guys but Mineta is there. Hhhhhh
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That’ll be entertaining 😂
Mark (Mad Doctor): I agree with you about A Yamaha and Tokoyami. Deku, Momo, and Iida look pretty good, but I'm not crazy about the rest. Wither Mina?
Marisa (Mawisa): Mina isn’t on the cast list either. Hm. I wonder if Toru will be there?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Prob not?
Marisa (Mawisa): [invisible jokes]
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Low key mad they left out half the bakusquad but kiri and Baku look good so I’m ok
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cosplans?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, isn't it a stage play?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just bought a bottle of tequila at 9:30 in the morning
Jess (whoozica): Y mineta but no mina? 😭
Tom (tomukuncosplay): ☝
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Mineta is the “comic relief” of class 1-A where as Mina was a character made to round out the class
Jess (whoozica): But she's cute
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If anyone hasn’t watched New girl, Peter B Parker is one of the leads. It makes it... very fun.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Figured out my first tattoo
Matt (mattmyers25): Apparently genlock premiered this morning on an RT stream
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "CROCEY"
Mark (Mad Doctor): I thought genlock wasn't due until mid January
Matt (mattmyers25): Seems like they did it early just for a holiday surprise
Mark (Mad Doctor): There's a Legoland at our local mall <@334090409389195266>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh my god!!! I have visitors
Rebecca (madameterralupus): > Riding in the car with Matt he mentions something about Mickey Mouse Club House
> me starts singing the theme song word for word xD
I think he's concerned lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): One of my friends just asked me if I wanted ti play bass in a new band he accidentally created <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): how do you "accidentally" create a band?  Lol
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Well ya see when a man and a guitar love eachother very much
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): And they dont use a pic to protect their fingers
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The band he's currently in was asked to play a benefit gig last year but they couldn't, but he still wanted to, so he asked one of our other friends who's in a band to join him and he brought one of *his* bandmates to do it and it was basically a little impromptu band thing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Now they have a few more gigs set up in 2019 but the other person they had doing bass can't do it so he asked me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Since I main bass whenever we get together to jam (even though I don't own a bass lol)
ZombieHunter: anyone wanna go on a kbbq squad date sometime lol
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Pick me pick me 🙋🏼‍♀️
Matt (mattmyers25): Sure
ZombieHunter: i want kbbq so bad
ZombieHunter: but i feel sad going alone xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd be down!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’ve never been but I wanna go!
ZombieHunter: it's so good
ZombieHunter: i go all the way to VA with Casey and Jake all the time. but i'd like to do more things like it up here for like just random squad dinners for fun
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Pick a place and I’m down!
ZombieHunter: We gotta find a good AYCE
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao so we're looking at Christmas lights at some big like ranch/event place. I'm like oh wow this place would be pretty for a wedding ~~i did look at it back when I was to be married~~ and my mom goes "find a man first then we can talk" lmao savage!
Matt (mattmyers25): Shots fired
