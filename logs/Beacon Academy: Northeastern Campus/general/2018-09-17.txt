Erik (slendergiant): So I finally figured out approximately how long it takes me to do a drawing: about two hours from sketch to final piece
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): HAPPY ANNIVERSARY YOU BEAUTIFUL SMOLS <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978>
Erik (slendergiant): Happy Anniversary! üòÄ
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
Jess (whoozica): Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Thanks!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Happy Anniversary <@!351785752197201920>  and <@!351471675843411978> ‚ù§ ‚ù§
Evie (Katheryne Knight): HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
Jess (whoozica): thank youuuuuu ‚ù§
Erik (slendergiant): Hey <@301927856240459777> have you seen and/or tried this?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:blockyhands:484798627752181761> ü§¢
Marisa (Weeb): o ya i've seen it in a few vending machines and one of my classmates drinks it sometimes
I've never tried it though, I only drink water and hot chocolate
Marisa (Weeb): some weird drinks exist here
Erik (slendergiant): I kind of want to try it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof I feel like that wouldn‚Äôt taste good.
But I also dislike soda
Erik (slendergiant): *-dumps Coke into morning coffee-*
Marisa (Weeb): they have really surprising tastes here. I've tried pringles that are steak flavored that are 100% exactly steak taste. no chip taste it's really freaky. and the apple kitkats taste purely like apples with no chocolate taste it's very disorienting.
Marisa (Weeb): so it might be wholly coca cola flavored
or coffee flavored
Erik (slendergiant): STEAK PRINGLES??? I NEED
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH THEY'RE SO GOOD
Jess (whoozica): why they wanna ruin coffee wif cola üò≠
Marisa (Weeb): starbucks vs dunkin vs wawa vs coca cola
Marisa (Weeb): a challenger appears
Erik (slendergiant): I found an article about it. When you pour it, it looks like a cup of black coffee but with that carbonated head of soda. The initial taste is that of coffee but with an aftertaste of Coke
Marisa (Weeb): that sounds really freaky
Erik (slendergiant): https://soranews24.com/2018/09/17/we-got-our-hands-on-a-can-of-coffee-flavored-coca-cola-from-vietnam-and-it-busted-our-senses/
Erik (slendergiant): *"Go loved coffee and Coca-Cola, but the powerful fusion of both proved a little too much for his mind to handle. Nevertheless, he felt it **oddly satisfying to simultaneously consume both** and reckoned it would definitely jump-start a sluggish day at work."*
Marisa (Weeb): "on sale in japan soon"? but I've seen it before üò± unless i'm mixing it up with another coca cola coffee thing?
Marisa (Weeb): Go scares me
Marisa (Weeb): no man should be that powerful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): regret
Marisa (Weeb): ooo the plus version will be on sale soon
Marisa (Weeb): **P L U S U L T R A**
Evie (Katheryne Knight): MHA but Shigaraki has feet instead of hands
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Erik (slendergiant): I'll add it to my draw list
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I LOOK FORWARD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978>  Yooooo yall Happy Anniversary!!!!

Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Never seen one of these before.
Erik (slendergiant): I love how you can *just* see Ryan's hand holding mine xD
Erik (slendergiant): I just noticed you posted these. They look great!
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I @'d you right?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Always worry I'm going to forgot someone one day.
Erik (slendergiant): Maybe? Georgia just posted one and tagged me so I just went to check your site
Erik (slendergiant): Maybe I missed it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I went back up to announcements where it was posted. You @'d him Bill. Probs just got missed XDD (Happens to me a lot)
Erik (slendergiant): Ah gotcha. I believe I was driving down to Philly at that time so I probably got the notification and cleared it without actually looking at it
