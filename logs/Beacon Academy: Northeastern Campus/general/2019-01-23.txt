Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): All I got out of it is that I'm being sexist towards men or something?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Which in itself is hilarious
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Based on your adam post LMAO
Mark (Mad Doctor): They used words in English. 
Were they supposed to convey meaning?
Anna (Cadmium): You used a lot of words. Statistically some of them should be good, but  no
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Major yikes. Trying to use the racism against faunas and abuse as a reason to EXCUSE his actions. Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaa N O

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IV1H1ME?ascsubtag=2bdbc2ae3e240051ed1dc837d48cc3eff1711eb4&kinja_price=23&kinja_promocode=493GG6KN&tag=kinjadeals-20 I kinda want one of these for my switch, but I feel like having it dangle off my switch would be annoying.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): get the velcro-y command strips and attach it to the back and then you can remove it when in dock mode
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's what I did with my USB hub on my laptop for a while
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): s'long as the velcro on the switch isn't too thick, not much give in the dock.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's a good idea tho.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or get the little velcro dots
Erik (Red Riot Thot): put the soft side on the Switch
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I gotta look for them.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.amazon.com/VELCRO-Brand-Sticky-Fasteners-Perfect-x/dp/B000TGUOCO?th=1
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Might just go irl shopping for em. I don't want to spend 25 bucks to get a 3 dollar thing.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I figured. You can get them from Walmart
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ye.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My car just in the shop. *again*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OOh. My fancy wallet from Kickstarter shipped.
Jamie (Jamie): Damn one of those perfect moments needed 50 from a stack of paper grabbed exactly 50 before counting ✨✨✨
Georgia (Something Sensible): So a bunch of Noah’s roommates got smashed last night, and his one roommates girlfriend was like “hey georgia come out here so we can see what an attractive person looks like!”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I just bumped into her this morning and she has no recollection of last night
Georgia (Something Sensible): And was like “omg you look so adorable today! I love your scarf! You always look so cute”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I’m like 👀👀 I know your secret
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh ye. I had a dream I had a Torchwick cosplay, just... in my closet. For like a year that I never wore. Then Konkon was like, in my backyard and I was going to skip cause I felt sick, but ended up throwing on the Torchwick get up and going anyway. *I don't know why I had to travel to my own backyard.* Forgot the cane tho; no one would drive me back to get it either (technically... drive... to the same location, damn dream logic). Pretty sure Georgia tried to get Tommy from Parks and Rec to do it instead of her even. XD

But ye. Totally woke up thinking I had a Torchwick cosplay. Quite strange.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oj my God XD
Marisa (Mawisa): Did you double check your closet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was full of perfect Torchwick swagger too. I remember talking about how you gotta keep your hat on your bed side, so when you swipe off the alarm you can swipe on your hat in the same motion. No thief is complete without his hat.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ,...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *sound of rolling chair on carpet*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, all good. still empty.
Anna (Cadmium): so it sounds like we need to get u a torchwick costume
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): my boi Kurto has that handled. Not to mention Chris.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~adds Torchwick to the list of things Bill now needs to cosplay, along with Hazel.~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Do it you won't :P
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'm sure Rebecca wouldn't have too much difficulty making a list of two things~~ 😏
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's such a long list though 😩
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~exactly how long is *your* cosplan list again?~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol mine?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Uhhh.... 👀😅
Anna (Cadmium): ~~her real one or the one she updates on FB~~
Jamie (Jamie): I should list mine but also I'm scared to because damn a few years of IMA DO THE THING ONE DAY
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye, the point of the joke is 2 is not long in comparison... so either would probably work.
Anna (Cadmium): i dont have mine written down past this year
Anna (Cadmium): like of what i plan for this year
Anna (Cadmium): thats it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The tracking on my Honeycolor contacts finally updated. They're coming from Malaysia so I figured they'd be shipped over the Pacific but I guess they're going West instead because they're currently in Germany lol
Marisa (Mawisa): i still can't believe tupac is dead
Marisa (Mawisa): and nobody told me..................................
Anna (Cadmium): you know elvis is dead right
Marisa (Mawisa): yeah i know some people whose house is basically a museum to him because they him at a food stand once. literally every room is floor to ceiling elvis memorabilia and there's one TV in the elvis room (the one room that doesn't double as another room) that is just for playing elvis-related DVDs and videos.
Anna (Cadmium): u ever just get validated that your obsession levels are normal
Marisa (Mawisa): it's the same or very similar to the model of TV that elvis shot once
Anna (Cadmium): thats concerning
Georgia (Something Sensible): i was gonna switch my section of my circuit class but my TA's email is "phillipmyinbox"
Georgia (Something Sensible): so hes gotta be a cool dude
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I had a physics lab instructor whose email was "lasermcdoodle"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Indeed, a very cool dude
