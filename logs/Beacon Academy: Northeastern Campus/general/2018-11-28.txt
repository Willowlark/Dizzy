Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Though pine is mixed with citrus... who’s the citrus
Halim (Greg) (jake): its not that good
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ozpin is citrus
Mark (Mad Doctor): Maybe a lime, given the color scheme
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I haven’t had it yet but all of my coworkers have said the jnpr latte tastes like a pine cone
Jess (whoozica): I'mma try it
~~people say that about gin too but I'm worth and I like it~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): In other news, the toasted white chocolate mocha is bangin' 👌🏻
Jess (whoozica): I mean I only get to a Starbucks like once every two weeks
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~I’ve been averaging around 3 a day~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~at least they're free~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~EXACTLY~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): How far into the negative would your bank account be if you weren't working there? 😂
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~tbh I wanna get into Pyrrha cos JUST to get the jnpr latte but I think my coworkers will hard core judge me😂~~
Jess (whoozica): DO IT
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): When I didn’t have a job for 3 months I only allowed myself one Starbucks drink a week. But when I worked at joanns I was ther every day before work so let’s not talk about how much money I’ve given that company in the past year because honestly I don’t want to know
Jess (whoozica): Your pay checks aren't even for working they are just paying you back for all the drinks
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Honestly yes 😂

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): @everyone Hey guys so I know a few of you know Nathaniel Edgar aka myrealmaincharacter. He’s an oobleck cosplayer, I know a lot of you met at rtx. I’ve had issues with him being obsessive and stalkerish in the past and I found out today that he has been emotionaly manipulating accentkisses and angrygigglypuff begins their backs since rtx. Not only did he ruin their friendship but he also ruined both of their long term relationships. He lied to them both for months and has been using their trust and nieveity to his own advantage. He’s not a good person and would NOT trust him. I’ve already blocked him on all forms of social media and I suggest you do the same.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’ve spoken to Mel and no one plans on putting him on blast and starting a witch hunt but she’s asked me to reach out to any social group that would know him to warn others of his actions.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Jeez
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeesh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thanks for the information. Hopefully the two girls can work things out.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I don't know this guy but if any of my other friends do I'll let them know
Halim (Greg) (jake): What a cuck
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Mel and emi are both in a bad spot emotionally right now and are doing everything they can to fix all the damage he’s done
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ouch so he was actually being manipulative when he paid Emilia’s rent?
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s pretty low
snow ( karma chameleon ): Oof
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That was basically him laying groundwork to gain their trust.
Halim (Greg) (jake): I'm not surprised
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He was a patreon to both of them so they thought they could trust him
Halim (Greg) (jake): I mean look at how he manipulated the details about what was going on between you and him 
To get Ems support
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He’s been lying to them for months
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I warned them back at rtx but they thought I was just an isolated incident
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He had them both too caught up in his web for them to realize until it was almost too late
Georgia (Something Sensible): So what was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Woah woah
Evie (Katheryne Knight): W h a t
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He had Mel convinced to leave mark and move across country for him. Only to find out HES been dating emi and bad talking Mel to her for months. All while emi had no idea he was also “dating” Mel
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WHAT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh my god
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It was a whole mess of an extremely unhealthily polyamoroys relationship
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay but my big question is where is Mel and Emmy now. Are they okay? Are they in safe locations
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nathaniel was dating Emilia? Wot?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that’s another thing what the living hell
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im so confused
Georgia (Something Sensible): Wait so last I heard at RTX was that Mark and Mel and Emilia were in polyamory
Georgia (Something Sensible): Did Nathaniel somehow get in on that?
Georgia (Something Sensible): And then boot Mark out?
Georgia (Something Sensible): _like trying to essentially take Mark’s place?_
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Nathaniel BROKE emi and Mel up
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Broke up emi and her fiancé
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And was convincing Mel to leave mark
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And while bad talking the both of them to the other
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): The only reason Mel found out is because emis fiancé found out last night and kicked her out on the street with nothing but her cell phone
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Emi is safe at a friends house currently
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): But she called Mel in tears last night apologizing for everything because she needed a friend
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And while Mel was comforting emi she found out about what had been going on woth Nathaniel
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): They spent hours going through messages last night tracing back the lies
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Jesus Christ
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Mel told me this afternoon
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh man I still can’t follow this story that’s crazy
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nathaniel seems so plain
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): A lot happened and a lot of lies were told
Jess (whoozica): 😭
Georgia (Something Sensible): I would’ve guessed that he was creepy but outright malignant seemed like a far reach
Georgia (Something Sensible): But this story would indicate otherwise
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's always the quite ones.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m worried about Mel... I’m tempted to message her to make sure she’s okay but I don’t want her to overwhelm her either
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): She’s going through a lot right now I’d give her space
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s what I figured
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thank god they found out before it got any further.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): She reached out to me to make sure he still wasn’t trying to get on my dick as well
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I really really hope she’s okay.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): She’s explained things to mark and while he has forgiven her he still very upset
Georgia (Something Sensible): So Mel is still with Mark then?
Georgia (Something Sensible): They have a house together right?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yes
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Mark knew about her relationship with emi and was ok with that but I don’t think he ever knew about her and Nathaniel
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just hope all the parties hurt by this monster are okay
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wish there was something I could do
Georgia (Something Sensible): Wait so Mel and Nathaniel started to be a thing?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nathaniel you hecker this is so messy
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yup
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also I think Nathaniel deleted all social media 
He’s not on insta when I look him up or Twitter
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He did
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Good
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He knows he’d catch heat
ZombieHunter: i need to talk to cat
ZombieHunter: she's housing him for Katsucon
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He’s not going to katsu anymore apparently
ZombieHunter: i'm gonna verify that with his room then
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof yeah I’d let other parties know 
Still let other parties know
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): At least he told Mel he wouldn’t but like can you really trust him
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m rooming with Mel so I can make sure he doesn’t do anything
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If he’s still going
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I sure hope he isn’t
ZombieHunter: he's rooming with cat so i can verify he's not going if i can get hold of her
ZombieHunter: he was in her room.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): This has all happened within the last few hours so they may not even know yet
ZombieHunter: and she'd never heard anything about him being sketch until chanwitz and i mentioned it to her
ZombieHunter: either way cat takes no shit.
ZombieHunter: She's a tough kid
Georgia (Something Sensible): You know the other day another account that was like [somethingsomething]maincharacter followed me on insta
Georgia (Something Sensible): That may be a personal account tho I can’t seem to find it again
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I would keep a lookout on another profile popping up
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I think he deleted all social media knowing he was gonna catch major heat
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He's still on Facebook
Georgia (Something Sensible): Even personals? My follower tracker says he deleted his IG but I remember specifically a new account following me
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): His handle was “myrealmaincharacter” on everything Twitter, insta, YouTube so if something like that pops up it’s prob him
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He deleted twitter and insta but he’s still on Facebook
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I blocked him on FB
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Good
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I wasn’t able to block him on insta before he deleted but I know he has my Snapchat and cell phone number so I blocked him on both of those and Facebook as well
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): To lighten the mood, I got this comment on my post 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Understandable, you are an adonis
Mark (Mad Doctor): Um, congratulations?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm just happy he finally came to terms with his sexuality
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You made him a happy boi
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I didn't even show the bellabooty!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~must be the bellaback muscles~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Your looking very dorito shaped in that photo you should be proud 👌🏻
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): <@!245270932602486784> is this the account you mentioned?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~bellaback muscles developed by those bellabittes~~
ZombieHunter: <@!327835140216586242> I’m also now hearing he was trying to get to Casey through Sara as well.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I mean I wouldn’t be surprised 🤷🏼‍♀️
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Just read all of this now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Huge yikes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Blocked
Halim (Greg) (jake): If he shows up at katsu 
Ill gladly tell the prick to fuck off in person 
With a foot in his ass if need be
Georgia (Something Sensible): That might be the account yeah! I can’t find it again for some reason but yeah
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s what I was warning about essentially
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That account is his backup, I blocked it as well
Halim (Greg) (jake): The bio of it is "Dont you forget about me"
