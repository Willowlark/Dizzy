Georgia (Something Sensible): I found a phone in the student center today
Georgia (Something Sensible): They had their phone background as that popular anime movie with the poster of the stars and the two people
Georgia (Something Sensible): I did my duty of uniting a weeb with his phone today
Marisa (Weeb): Your Name? OwO

Marisa (Weeb): Biru you should also consider downloading
Jess (whoozica): *yes*
Erik (slendergiant): There's Yang puns so so far it isn't awful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the yang puns are keeping me interested
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i think without the voice acting id be bored
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): it's a boring game on it's own.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Crappy tower defense + Loot crates + 'need to login every 3 hours' mechanics.
Erik (slendergiant): It's good for its art though
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, like the art.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I like the emotes; can I get them for other purposes?
Erik (slendergiant): Bellabooty stance
Jess (whoozica): tfw no booty ðŸ˜¦
Erik (slendergiant): ~~damn that coat~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ i really suck at this game~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~losing interest already!!
Georgia (Something Sensible): I want it but Reileyâ€™s complaints about the tutorial make me wanna wait til later
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its REALLY long
Erik (slendergiant): you have to play like 3 rounds
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its actually 4
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they make you play one more after the tutorial
Erik (slendergiant): oh right
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But fully voiced so. I didn't mind that.

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wanna check it out but my school's wifi is shiittt so I can't really mess with it until home
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i lost interest already tbh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not a fan of phone games xD
snow ( karma chameleon ): I hate mobile games so Iâ€™m not even gonna bother with it
Georgia (Something Sensible): Iâ€™m scrambling for that Pyrrha content orz
Erik (slendergiant): I'll be sure to screenshot and post the neat art for y'all
Erik (slendergiant): The struggle of doing these cosplay features is trying not to sound repetitive in my compliments ðŸ˜…
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's God's work, though. Nice way to spread positivity
Erik (slendergiant): that's why I'm trying to choose photos that have something that stands out like a cool edit, or an original design, or lining your costume with bee fabric

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Erik what do I*
Erik (slendergiant): How often do you print photos?
Erik (slendergiant): Or would this neato printer give you an excuse to print them more often?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I only print photos for my photo board, and those are only photos I'm in, which aren't super common...
Georgia (Something Sensible): Or pics of Tom apparently
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't have a need for it, but it's a good deal.
Erik (slendergiant): that's always a mood
