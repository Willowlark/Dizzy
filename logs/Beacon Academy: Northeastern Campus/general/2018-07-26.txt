Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hehe. I've done that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): "Somebody stop that car" was the voice line there.

Mark (Mad Doctor): So I've been snorkelling a few times over the past few days. For the first time ever, my mask was letting in water like crazy. I was puzzled at first until I realized the cause of the problems: the Schnee-stache!
Georgia (Something Sensible): CURSED SCHNEE STACHE
Erik (slendergiant): That'll do it
Mark (Mad Doctor): On the other hand, i can use it to filter krill and other small sea critters for my evening meal
