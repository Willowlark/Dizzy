Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just saw a commercial for the pickle slushie. <@!334090409389195266>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was not fooled.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Its satan's beverage
Jess (whoozica): I just are 3 pickles
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is anyone else having issues wit instastories not loading, or load the oldest ones where you have to rewatch them all??
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, I'm having that issue.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yep imstas a mess
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Erik (slendergiant): Yerp
Jess (whoozica): it keeps replaying yours and leannas over and over again
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay good to know mine isn't the only one being dumb XD Although does suck it's acting up completely >.<
Hopefully it gets fixed soon. And yeaaa same here Jess. It keeps playing Leanna's and Meg's over and over for me lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): RIP. Sorry friends
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's okay~ We just get to see your beautiful face over and over~❤
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Who calls Black Sun Eclipse.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, Really.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fun fact Mark, the Yang x Ironwood ship is Iron Fist.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've seen people call it Eclipse a few times. Not much tough and it always confuses me lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So. Jacques ships, according to reddit:
```
Ruby: Trophy Wife
Weiss: Daddy knows best
```
Then we go to CIEL, with `Grandfather Clock`.  There's only one more named ship.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Anyone want to guess?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No one?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's ***Adam***, and called *Daddy's Razor*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): r/rwby has *odd taste*
Erik (slendergiant): These are cursed ships. Let them sink
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nah boi.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Adam and Jacques can get frisky.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So wonderful news, they updated Tauradonna to Animal Abuse.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s been a thing since season 3 XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I call BlakexSun Blacksun 

And BlakexIlia Catmeleon
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m making it a goal to have a fucking harem whenever I get a chance to cosplay Blake XD
Erik (slendergiant): I call Blake x Sun "Black Hole Sun" because of references to edgy 90s grunge xD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): PFFT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): blake hole sun
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just didn't realize they updated the reddit spreadsheet.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just think Blake x Sun x Ilia x Yang x Weiss should just be called Total Eclipse of the Heart or Love is a Battlefield 

Because 80s love ballads
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Reading Rainbow is most popular for BlakexIlia.
Erik (slendergiant): I like that so much better than Catmeleon
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I like Catmeleon cause of the play on words TTuTT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i still stan IliaxWeiss being "Cold Blooded"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no one can ever change my mind
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I mean like I prefer Gelato over Orange Sorbet for TorchwickxNeo but Idk which is more popular
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gelato ye.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I also like Partners in Cream >u<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cause play on words/phrase
Erik (slendergiant): I'm glad they finally updated Taiyang x Summer to *Summer Lovin'*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOOH I LIKE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): What’s Raven x Tai’s popular name?
Erik (slendergiant): That's what I've been calling it since Katsu but it used to be *Tiamat* which I thought was dumb
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): taimat?????????
Erik (slendergiant): Tai x Raven is currently *Elder Bird* but it used to be *Phoenix*
Erik (slendergiant): I like Phoenix better
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah Tiamat I think is a reference to some dragon in DnD but I don't know how that relates to Summer
Erik (slendergiant): Also, Taiyang x Ilia is *Tai-dye*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀 thats a ship?
Erik (slendergiant): Everything's a ship Leanna
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you're right, my mistake
Erik (slendergiant): Reading Rainbow is also another name for Blake x Neon
Erik (slendergiant): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_bnr68pepImz1RDq7uJiQraVnDjU2D0vqmrSE85sF_U/edit#gid=1295997636
Erik (slendergiant): Ok there's a better name for Scarlet x Neon than *LSD* and it's *Turned Free*. I approve xD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Meeeeeh I like Phoenix better >.< 
Elderbird is too close to Elderburn >.<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Aka my other ship for Winter besides Snowbird XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's not the reddit chart, where'd this one come from?
Erik (slendergiant): A google search for "RWBY shipping chart"
Erik (slendergiant): where's the reddit one?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JpinKp5XW6htsPAri0kRMGKrxQwi458YU6HY734wuwE/edit#gid=0 the one you linked is more complete. Sort of.
Erik (slendergiant): ooh but I like *Domestic Dispute* better for Tai x Raven 😂
Jess (whoozica): can someone explain to me why they call it lancaster?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nope, actually.
Erik (slendergiant): https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/2xwyaq/why_is_rubyxjaune_called_lancaster/
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oof, Jacques X  Blake is Slave Labor.
Jess (whoozica): OOOO ok
Jess (whoozica): thanks erik
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): no Jacques X Cardin ship? The shipper in me is dying.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Jacques x Port: Mustache Daddys
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I live for the fact every crack ship in RWBY has a name.
Erik (slendergiant): Add Watts and make it a mustache threesome
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): why is that not an OT3.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My favorite will always be `Lie, Steal, Cheat and Survive    Ren x Sun x Jaune x Roman`
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): `Pet Store    Shopkeeper    Blake    Velvet    Sun    Neon    Adam    Tukson` Kinky.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): does this mean there's at least one fanfic out there for all these ships?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am loving tis sip names from that list XD Some of them are too funny lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): who the hecc is dr merlot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh wait...nvm grimm eclipse dude

Erik (slendergiant): MINOR CHARACTERS FTW
Erik (slendergiant): Meg said if I assemble a GB NDGO she'd get a GB SSSN together
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh yess that'd be cool! :0

Georgia (Something Sensible): I'm looking at holidays because Jess reminded me it's international kissing day and this holiday seems like a relevant excuse to post some bumblebee 👀👀👀
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): This is also relevant for everyone
Jess (whoozica): The 8th is video game too apparently
Jess (whoozica): I didn't see these ones when I was looking!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Every day is a holiday now, curse you hallmark and your control over the holiday.
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Jess (whoozica): I mean those don't really matter, halmark doesn't bank on them
Georgia (Something Sensible): Moon day wooo! 🌙
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also it's space exploration day
Georgia (Something Sensible): July 20th is gonna be lit
Georgia (Something Sensible): _full NASA gear no holding back_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Isn’t that weezer?
Georgia (Something Sensible): _full NASA gear and one weezer shirt no holding back_
Mark (Mad Doctor): So, Audrey and I were driving home, and I was summarizing the ship discussion earlier in this thread. Having been surprised that anyone would ship Jacques with anyone other than a very large axe, here's what I wanted to say: "I don't think I can support any Jaques Schnee ships" 

Here's what I actually said: "I don't Schnipps"

I apparently triggered Audrey's asthma
Jess (whoozica): Lmao no Schnippz kids
Mark (Mad Doctor): Say "Schnee ships" three times fast. I dare you
Georgia (Something Sensible): No schnipps 😂
Marisa (Weeb): Oooo NDGO’s voice actors cosplayed their characters you should @ them if you do the cosplay
