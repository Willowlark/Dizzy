Marisa (Mawisa): o is that a thing people do on christmas. i thought that happened at midnight
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Depends what time you go
Marisa (Mawisa): there's a synagogue in nyc that has hannukah services but you have to pay for it. the free service has you sit in a dark basement and just listen through the floorboards it's weird.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That makes zero sense lol
Marisa (Mawisa): out of curiosity, are the presents related to religion?
