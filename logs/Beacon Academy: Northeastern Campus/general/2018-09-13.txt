Erik (slendergiant): *Don't tempt me Frodo...*
Erik (slendergiant): Also, I still have to finish Hogwarts. I've been slacking
Erik (slendergiant): Also also, I racked up about $1k just in car repairs this month so I defs need to stop the impulse buying for a bit
Erik (slendergiant): On an unrelated note, it's amazing the difference music can make to your work day. I've been listening to calm relaxing music (similar to the music that was playing in the spa area at the Kalahari) and it's honestly made the days dull and dragging (also didn't help I was kind of at a stand-still in work). Finally got some hot items on my to-do list that I actually know what needs to be done, put on an EDM workout mix, and bam. Increase on productivity
Erik (slendergiant): Also helped that I turned my phone completely off for a bit
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yup.
Jess (whoozica): You know you're an adult when you squell "ohhh Swiffers are on sale!"
