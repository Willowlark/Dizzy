Erik (Red Riot Thot): So every year my dad puts together a yearly letter to send out to the rest of the family highlighting what we did throughout the year. My paragraph was mostly about me doing cosplay and he had to add the dictionary definition of cosplay 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): a Cosplay™  group
Jess (whoozica): Wholesome
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats the cutest thing ive ever read wtf
Matt (mattmyers25): I just preorder the darling in the franxx limited edition part 1 for half off. It's too goo of a deal to pass up

Jamie (Jamie): Whats the anime <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Soul Eater!! 🙌🏻
Marisa (Mawisa): Ooo that’s a good one
So popular they aired the repeat show
And then have you seen the spin off soul eater not
No one ever seems to know that one despite soul eater’s popularity. Granted it’s moe garbage but it’s soul eater moe garbage
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I think one of my favorite things about working at coffee shops 
Is that I get off work and go see friends or come home to family
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): And they are like "you smell like coffee" 
As if it's some odd revelation
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Soul Eater Not yea? I never read or watched it... but it seemed eehhh 🤷🏻‍♀️
But yesss Soul Eater is so good! I never finished it for some reason but determined to now. I honestly forgot about it for a while 😩
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Like imagine, I, who works making coffee for like 6+ hours
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Smell like coffee
Marisa (Mawisa): Soul eater manga has a gender bender part where the characters stay genderbent based on how lewd their thoughts are and it’s really funny
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lol I get the same thing with my mom buuuttt with glitter. I'll come home and she's like you're covered in glitter. Like duh, I work at a craft store. We sell it and currently have Christmas stuff covered in it I've been moving around .-.
Marisa (Mawisa): That’s weird Greg you should get that checked out. See a doctor about smelling like what you always interact with. You may be becoming coffee.
Marisa (Mawisa): It’s Christmas yehaw
Marisa (Mawisa): Every single 7/11 has had people outside the last two days dressed in reindeer kigu selling cake
Marisa (Mawisa): I hope they do it today too I want cake
Marisa (Mawisa): That doesn’t cost $60+ for a single serving I could eat in 2 minutes. Important because a lot of Christmas cakes are that apparently.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm watching The Grinch with my mom and wow. Am I The Grinch?! XDD
