Marisa (Weeb): The complexity of the present time seems to demand an unfolding of our third eyes if we are going to survive.

The cosmos is calling to you via pulses. Can you hear it? Have you found your path? How should you navigate this joyous universe?

Where there is greed, intention cannot thrive. Without inseparability, one cannot live. Only a prophet of the world may foster this fusion of inseparability.

Empathy is the healing of chi, and of us. To engage with the path is to become one with it. By refining, we self-actualize.

Awareness requires exploration.
It can be difficult to know where to begin. If you have never experienced this uprising devoid of self, it can be difficult to reflect. Although you may not realize it, you are angelic.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Thank you!
Marisa (Weeb): I’m on the train to work someone else gotta take care of the next person 😭
Erik (slendergiant): *where do you find these*
Marisa (Weeb): These new age ones I cheat a bit with but desperate times call for desperate measures
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): She writes them most of the time

Marisa (Weeb): We are in the midst of a sensual invocation of insight that will become our stepping-stone to the dreamtime itself. We are at a crossroads of power and stagnation. Our conversations with other messengers have led to a flowering of ultra-sacred consciousness.


Eons from now, we dreamers will heal like never before as we are reborn by the dreamtime. Imagine a condensing of what could be. We are being called to explore the solar system itself as an interface between inseparability and love.

You may be ruled by stagnation without realizing it. Do not let it shatter the healing of your quest. You must take a stand against selfishness. Only a traveller of the cosmos may harmonize this fount of coherence.

How should you navigate this consciousness-expanding solar system?
The goal of supercharged electrons is to plant the seeds of understanding rather than bondage. Today, science tells us that the essence of nature is balance. By evolving, we believe.

Soon there will be an awakening of spacetime the likes of which the dreamtime has never seen. The quantum cycle is approaching a tipping point. Gaia will let us access ancient health.
Erik (slendergiant): <@!169297844874903552> did you see Lindsay liked your tweet?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I did! 😂 I was like omg we have been blessed~ 🙏🏻
Erik (slendergiant): So I had that meeting with that sales person and holy fuck was she wearing a lot of perfume
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Jess (whoozica): OMG I have the same problem with a sales guy that comes here he reeks of cologne must be some kinda tactic
Erik (slendergiant): It was also awkward because she's doing her sales pitch at me and I'm just like *"I don't deal with this stuff... I don't know what parts we use from you guys... I don't deal with purchasing..."*
Erik (slendergiant): Luckily it was only like a few minutes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): guys, apparently bees are stinging the customers when they walk in
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the bees know i want to go home and are protecting me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bless them.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Who even IS Brian but I love him.
Erik (slendergiant): ?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Office.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Last season is mess.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~At least I hope 9 is the last one~~
Erik (slendergiant): Ohhhh Brian's the boom operator. And yes, Season 9 is the last season. It is kind of a mess but the finale is still pretty satisfying
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Nerd club shared fandoms in our opening meeting
Erik (slendergiant): I like how Tom Holland is a fandom in and of itself
meghan (meghan): Beautiful
Mark (Mad Doctor): There was a fight over that, with some purists arguing a person can't be a fandom. I was able to assuage both sides by suggesting a game in which the "Tom Holland" player tries to spoil a film or work of fiction while a "Benedril Cucumberpatch" player has to cut them off or redirect them.
Erik (slendergiant): Incredible
meghan (meghan): Tumblr culture has trained my brain to automatically associate any name where the first name starts with B and the last name starts with C as Benedict Cumbersnatch because at first I didn’t even realize you had done the same to his name 😂
Erik (slendergiant): I also like how you got his first name correct but not his last 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well that must be awkward Meg. 

- **B**ill **C**lark
Mark (Mad Doctor): The extra L is for the Ladies 😉
Mark (Mad Doctor): In Tom Hollland
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I was gonna mention the Tom Holland thing too lmao
