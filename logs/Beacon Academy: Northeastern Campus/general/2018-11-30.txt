Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!266718984571846656>  I think most of us are doing the trade on new years but if you are not attending but want to participate im sure we can figure something out for you to trade your gift with the person you get/receive from whoever got you~
snow ( karma chameleon ): yeah ok!! i made plans to go visit my gf for new years so i wasnt sure ; - ;
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO~ ❤ Have fun if ya do!
And all good! If you wanted to participate we could take your gift along and give to the person if they also are attending and pick yours up to give you next time we see you lol
