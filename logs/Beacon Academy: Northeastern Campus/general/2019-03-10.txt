Mark (Mad Doctor): So I'm watching the vol. 4 RWBY episode where Qrow is telling the Maiden backstory to get ideas for God of Light poses (spoiler: big gold yoga teacher). It also has that great scene where Ghira dumps on Blake's outfit for being a) too skimpy and b) under armored. But then I realized *dude wears less shirt than Sun does.* Love ya, Ghira, but drop the double standards
