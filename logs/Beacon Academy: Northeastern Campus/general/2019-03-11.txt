Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm a miniatures gamer. I fucking *lived* helping my kids with dioramas
Georgia (Something Sensible): rutgers made a cosplay club but the founder hasnt really gotten any responses in their post in the rutgers reddit
Georgia (Something Sensible): they also ended their post with "XD"
Georgia (Something Sensible): ah shes a freshman
Georgia (Something Sensible): thatll do it

Georgia (Something Sensible): well at least this girl starting it is female
Georgia (Something Sensible): ill try going
Georgia (Something Sensible): they said for more info to DM them but i dont wanna EXPOSE my IDENTITY
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Go and senpai it up for the baby cosplayer
Georgia (Something Sensible): _it doesnt look like she knows what worbla is_
Georgia (Something Sensible): i could easily achieve senpai status hmmmm
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/axoccp/the_creators_club_update/
Georgia (Something Sensible): looks like the founder has a place on campus to work on stuff at least...
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh they made a post before that that got traction
Georgia (Something Sensible): _someone commented saying they were impressed with the geek week cosplayers aha_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~georgia arent u already senpai~~
go do it just say hey i was one of the geek week cosplayers
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Just don’t overextend yourself into the group to quickly. Scope it out first.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~burner account?~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): they seem to have potential
Georgia (Something Sensible): _i did win the geek week cosplay contest this is true_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): did u compete under your username or your name name
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~If you’re a cosplayer you may as well get used to showing your face~~

Georgia (Something Sensible): Interesting event planning 🤔
Mark (Mad Doctor): Going to cons for recognition? I go for giggles and memes
Georgia (Something Sensible): I go for people to tell me that I’m dead goddamn
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Careful you don’t get roped into guiding them around, lest you get another circle of people to split your time on at cons. Cool and aloof is the way of the senpai.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeeee 😎
Georgia (Something Sensible): I don’t really want anyone to con with, moreso anyone who has the same hobby on campus
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~and if anyone’s cute there I mean~~

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): How do you navigate twitter. It’s not chronological right. And filled with likes and retweets rather than actual tweets.
