Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I know it's for a research essay so the response probs wouldn't be accurate but dammit why do I want to see what the drunk responses would be so badly XDD~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Welp, got these bluetooth headphones and paired them to my phone and it worked, no problem. Unpaired them so I could demonstrate how to do it to my tech illiterate mother and now it doesn't show up as an available device
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Not even on another device
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn that sucks :\
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Never mind I figured it out. What I thought was pairing mode was not, in fact, pairing mode
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Well at least you got it figured out and they aren't already broken! Cause that'd really suck. 👌
Jamie (Jamie): WhAT the fuq is this

Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lowkey I was going to be very salty if he didn't 😅
Jess (whoozica): Yaaay!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm in charge of dressing us because he has no idea what he's doing other than he wants a suit instead of a tux lol
Jess (whoozica): Omg 😂
Jess (whoozica): I used men's Warehouse for my wedding
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's what he's thinking
Jess (whoozica): Yea it was pretty easy and they have a lot of choices. They have a thing inline where you can out different pieces together to make outfits and then save them
Erik (Red Riot Thot): We're also thinking of love a charcoal. I found this and he seemed to like it
Jess (whoozica): Niceee 👌
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He just needs to decide if we're doing fat ties, skinny ties, pre-tied bow ties, or tied bow ties
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oooh and do they have a thing like that? I didn't see it but maybe I missed it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'd like to try to piece things together to see how they'd look
Jess (whoozica): They used too at least 🤔
Georgia (Something Sensible): What do you mean you aren’t wearing your Taiyang suit 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I could suggest it but my sister would kill me. You should have seen the daggers in my sister's eyes when he mentioned "polka dot tie"
