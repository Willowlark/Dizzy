Erik (slendergiant): Ok so random thought. I'm rewatching My Hero Academia in English and I'm at the sports festival part and they introduced Hatsume and the way the English voice actress portrays her makes me wish Kristen Schaal was voicing her because they have the same energy
Erik (slendergiant): Imagine this...
Erik (slendergiant): Voiced by this
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜‚ omg yes
Matt (mattmyers25): https://toooldforfandom-liveblogs.tumblr.com/post/178362275981/im-sorry

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There are things I could do to improve my website. Tags for searching galleries by con, series... Try and paginate in gallery (the Wildlife gallery ~~that I'm sure no one has ever seen~~ is like, 200 images long)...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But like the tagging? That's a butt load of manual work. No way to automate it.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof I just remember I have a website but never really finished makin it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): And the longer I put them off, it's only going to be more work.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ouch 
Iâ€™d say just do it but I know how you feel~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But every time I do something to make the site better, a month later I come up with a better idea.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
MAJOR MOOD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need more time in the day man. ~~and motivation~~.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I code (on a good day) all day for work though, not what I want to do on a weekend.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Shit Jess.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You guys spiked the analytics when you shared the chatterbox shoot to your family.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Surprise
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeet
Jess (whoozica): lmao yeeeee
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It looks significant!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I have no idea how to read these charts but spike is good~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I now have two interviews with two different  starbucks tomorrow yeet
Jess (whoozica): good luck fren
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): They both mentioned multiple stores getting together to do the interviews 
But also theyre in different locations
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So I'm not sure if I might accidentally get interviewed by the same group twice
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *take both, thatâ€™s double the free drinks*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Lol work at both starbucks locations that'd be hilarious
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I know a couple of ppl who work at multiple Starbucks locations
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That means TEN free Starbucks drinks a day hal
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): TAKE THE DEAL
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): lol maybe if I get the job
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Real talk the amount I'll save if i get the job is kinda ridiculous if i look at my purchase history for the past 2 months
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Tbh thatâ€™s the main. Reason to get the job
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Like
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ive redeemed twice
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): And earned gold so thats like... 
450 stars
So 
225 dollars?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): If i get half off on drinks that means... 
112.5 dollars over 2 months saved
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): In my defense august was a rough travel month and i needed the bucks
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I got a green tea and a white hot chocolate today (and I'm still freaking tired, so thanks Starbucks) which makes me want to revisit the rewards program.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There's one in Armonk (the client site), one next door to my office...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So unless I'm working from home that's where I'd be going.
Jess (whoozica): There's not much caffeine in either
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Plenty of sugar tho.
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Green tea ~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's okay, I'm probably just dying.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): As much as I'd love to spend all my time with my camera (not so much developing, but) I'm glad I don't have to care about some of the nonsense I see cross my feeds.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Uber for Photographers*.
