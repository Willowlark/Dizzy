Jamie (Jamie): anyone with knowledge what this means? ~~i realize i could google might still but meh~~
Jamie (Jamie): semiconductor/electronics production
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like. i think it means probs design/manufacture of semiconductors and electronics components. 
semiconductors are. they have electrical conductivity between glass and metal. and their resistance decreases as temp increases if i remember right.
Jamie (Jamie): ah so roughly what i was thinking then lol weird that listing wanted experience in that but otherwise just a hs diploma. seems like you would need more of some kind of trade schooling
Anna (loud and likely blonde): what was the listing?
Jamie (Jamie): uh i forget now it was a sort of assistant job. i've been flying through reading so many now i can't recall lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): honestly like it might have just been like willing to learn  a system process for that
Jamie (Jamie): prolly
Jamie (Jamie): i've found though like 3 companies to do from an app work now tho? one is for house cleaning (cause fun fact i worked as a pro maid for 5 months) and 2 others im thinking i might see what happens if i apply to

Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@386624706612297729> you were probably just looking at like, an assembly job at a company that makes electrical components

Erik (Red Riot Thot): probably not an actual Comic Con‚Ñ¢
Erik (Red Riot Thot): probably some dumpy little local con
Jamie (Jamie): it will be an adventure one way or another lol
Jamie (Jamie): i feel like i'm going in a direction of "i should start a blog of some kind because i'm doing strange things in my life and documenting them for others amusement win or lose might also be profitable socially professionally or low chance financially"
Jamie (Jamie): title of blog series "FUCK IT, I'm gonna do it"
Jamie (Jamie): or "FUCK im doing it"
Jamie (Jamie): "I'm looking for a female willing to get tickled for cash. A series of tickle challenges that last about an hour. " so get paid to be tortured for an hour? i think not death

Georgia (Something Sensible): niceee
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey: Dad! I met another girl who's a cosplayer! And her dad cosplays, too! You should meet him and become best friends.
Me: Cool. What does he cosplay?
Audrey: He's planning to do Mineta.
Me:

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): https://tenor.com/view/hide-homer-bushes-gif-10492932
Anna (loud and likely blonde): there are only 2 acceptable mineta. 
1) that girl from katsu who did him with the platform crocs
2) the mineta i wanna do in order to pie for charity money
Jamie (Jamie): 3) the life size plush that im gonna make with velcro balls on his head that people can kick around if that is the preference
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~just a reminder, people are allowed to cosplay shitty characters~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: my teacher is talking about unions
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and just went "One University in New Jersey, Rutgers University, has 24 unions"
Jamie (Jamie): the truely unacceptable way of shit character cosplays would be that you actually treat people like the chara does in which you being an ass no one wanted this
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: <@!245270932602486784>  it you
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i think we have the most teacher unions or something?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah its more like. how u gonna act as that character.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~how do you have 24 teacher unions what~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): knowing someone is cosplaying a "shitty character" is like "ok youre probably not gonna fuck it up but damn theres so much potential to fuck it up"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean... I plan to cosplay Adam. He's a shitty character.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~they're really shitty to their teachers so a lot of unions come to save them~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): the unions at rutgers have a lot of bargaining power apparently
Anna (loud and likely blonde): someone gotta be the villains
Mark (Mad Doctor): The Mineta cosplayers I have seen have done it in a spirit of fun. However, as an older cosplayer, I am constantly worried about appearing like the Creepy Old Guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Cosplaying a creeper seems like it would confirm everyone's worst assumptions
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Mood I worry about being the Creepy Fat Guy (with a camera!).
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oof thats a sad reality. 
~~but considering i have dealt with many a creep i can say neither of u come off like a creep~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Thank ‚ù§Ô∏è
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): In your case mark, I find the typical creep doesn‚Äôt have a cosplay. If they do it‚Äôs ill fitting and looks like an excuse to be in the con.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Usually they rock street clothes (whoops me) at cons.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): But lack 50 pounds of camera gear like the photographers.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I could be wrong tho, I‚Äôm the deterrent not the one who gets creeped on.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~A I‚Äôm a large enough dude they feel intimidated to approach the girls I‚Äôm hanging with; B they see me as a bruhda and assume I‚Äôve got harassing THESE women covered and move on to spread the creep~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Kind of you both to say. I'm sure it's more my anxiety than anything I project. Still, I can't fault any cosplayer (particularly young and female-presenting ones) from acting defensively. Lord knows there's cause for it at most cons
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ^
Anna (loud and likely blonde): its an ingrained feeling that one picks up on in their gut when someone is gonna be a creep bc of their stance and actions and just what they talk about to you (yes talk at, not to or with)  but ill def say that being genuine ~~and showering~~ and being interested in talking to people like PEOPLE normally shows that thou art not a creep
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i think u forget option c which is the creep realizes that he is in the presence of an actually rational person who is most likely a friend of the ppl he was gonna creep on and that he might get his ass beat with a telescoping lens. Not that u would do that tho cause camera equipment expensive.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Never got around to the labs to record my project for class tomorrow but aayyy my phone actually ended up doing a damn good job pn picking up the audio <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Mark (Mad Doctor): Nope. Not creepy at all
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): YASSS
Anna (loud and likely blonde): this is completely normal
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): love the obligatory dab
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was thinking of wearing Crocs with it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes. Perf addition to it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~orange crocs or camo crocs~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): I got bright red because I think the God of Light will be wearing them at some point
Anna (loud and likely blonde): beautiful
Mark (Mad Doctor): Local news just announced that Bryce Harper jerseys have sold out in Philadelphia. Which answers the question "Which cosplays are more popular than bnha?"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i wonder if they have photo meetups
Mark (Mad Doctor): I hear their cons are really expensive, like $35 for just daily admission
