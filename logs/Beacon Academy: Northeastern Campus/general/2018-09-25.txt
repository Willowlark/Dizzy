Marisa (Weeb): why is the internet so quiet right now
where the party people at
there are universal mysteries ready to be discussed here and everyone is sleeping
Marisa (Weeb): for example, if radishes are called 'rad-ish' why isn't there an incredibly popular dieting/popularity scheme from food companies to get impressionable teenagers to eat a lot of radishes to become more rad-ish? obama explain.
Erik (slendergiant): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A mood. The internet is quiet tonight XD I'm like so bored. Where everyone at?! XD
Jess (whoozica): I here!
Erik (slendergiant): <@301927856240459777> I ordered that tooth black stuff you recommended. We'll see how it works 👌🏻
Marisa (Weeb): WOO
i hope it tastes minty fresh
Marisa (Weeb): the manga site i read on has a fake 'under maintenance' sign up for people with adblock and now i can't check to see if manga has updated every 5 seconds. i cri
Erik (slendergiant): Rude
Erik (slendergiant): So far my afternoon has been spent designing cosplay business cards
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OH?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A good use of an afternoon lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need to redo mine.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not that I don't have two boxes of the old ones.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I feel like my signature/logo should be on it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The old english C.
Erik (slendergiant): Speaking of which, Billiam, permission to use any of your photos of me?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Go ahead. 😊
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need to redo mine too. I want to update it with new costumes. And for my photography ones I just need new ones cause I lost them all somehow 🤷
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Dammit now I want to redo my business cards right now.. but I really should pay attention to class XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): indeed.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If I had any graphic design talent I would do mine.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nope.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So I just googled 'what has components'. `Component` is the term I'm going to use to label an object in a code structure, and I want a name for a object that contains them.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So, go to google, get the real world equivalent.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Little did I know component is now basically a CS term.
Erik (slendergiant): Ok, so I need some advice. I have one side of my card designed (technically the back) and it has all the info I want and I think it looks aesthetically pleasing:
Erik (slendergiant): But the other side (technically the front), I just have this picture and there's a lot of empty space. I'm not sure what to put there except my name? Like, I don't want to repeat too much of the info from the other side, but I don't want it to look too empty
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe don't put anything?  or download a cool font that will take up more  space
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe add little social media icons
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): along the bottom part where its  empty space along the rocks
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also you should put more contrast on the back. Distracting to read.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im gonna drop a photo of my cards just for reference
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): eh wait ill get a better one
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Those are nice.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so like maybe instead of typing out the "facebook", "instagram", etc. just add the little icons along the bottom to everything you are active on
Erik (slendergiant): which is basically just instagram lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): rip
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nvm then
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Erik (slendergiant): that's why I just have my two active handles on the back. Should probably stick an IG icon there
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea definitely
Erik (slendergiant): Ok, bumped up the opacity of the transparent white rectangle I have over the picture so you can read it better and added the IG icon. Does it look weird being to the right of the handles? It looked a lot worse to the left because of the right justification
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Should make rounded corners on the QR code.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also where's the QR code lead? Make sure it's somewhere constant.
Erik (slendergiant): I would if I could but my options are limited on Vistaprint 🙃
Erik (slendergiant): It's linked to my linktree
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ah ye, that's what I did for mine.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Download the image and reupload it after editing offline.
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah that's what I'm doing now
Jess (whoozica): for the front id say bump the text down a bit and maybe pick a more show-y font like Leanna mentioned? they are typically called "Display" fonts as they are made for impact over readability (which doesn't mean you cant read them, just that you wouldn't use them for copy)
Erik (slendergiant): Here's empty and with a different font
Erik (slendergiant): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Maybe do a stairs thing with your name.
Slender
   Giant
      Cosplay
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Takes up more space.
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): I read safety line as salty like
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You'd be salty if the card came out cropped.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): still valid.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh I'd ditch the 'follow me'. It's kinda obvious when you're giving them a card.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like the clolor on the tiered name though.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah but the naked QR code would look kinda lame IMO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I thought that before, but the border makes it look much nicer.
Erik (slendergiant): My thinking was that if it was naked then it would be like *mystery link*
Erik (slendergiant): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yeee
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): though I'd make the QR a little bigger. so it lines up with the bottom of the last line of text.
Erik (slendergiant): does it not line up?
Erik (slendergiant): I fucking love Vistaprint. You can always find a good promo code. Found one for 40% off 👌
Jess (whoozica): awww ye i did my wedding intives through them
Erik (slendergiant): Yo with that code I can get 500 for less than 100 without the code
Erik (slendergiant): ~~but will I need that many?~~
Jess (whoozica): if you're gonna do 500 then make sure you REALLY like them
Erik (slendergiant): ye that's why I'm hesitant lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Definitely wont need that many
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I got 250 two years ago and I've hardly made a dent
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I mean I've only recently remembered to bring them to cons and stuff.. but still
Jess (whoozica): ive used about 30 of mine in 6 months? XD
Jess (whoozica): i print them at work tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don’t do 500. I think that’s what I did. Mistake.
Erik (slendergiant): I just did 100. Can always order more if needed
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Me: this is my third Starbucks drink today, I should start using rewards
The App: nah boi, I don’t take money.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Apparently it just hates Apple Pay.
