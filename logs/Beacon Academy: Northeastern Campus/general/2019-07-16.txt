Mark (Mad Doctor): Ru Paul's drag race is coming to my neighborhood this Wednesday
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): What for what xD
Mark (Mad Doctor): So my father-in-law actually worked at the Nevada Test Site aka Area 51.  He's really hoping nobody carries out the "rush the base" meme. The guards there are stationed in 110 degree heat and don't have much of a sense of humor
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 🍿
Mark (Mad Doctor): If I was stationed there, I would dress up as a Grey and wave at the mob from the other side of the fence
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
