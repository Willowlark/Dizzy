Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Today's not a good day for driving
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): is there ever tho.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Fair point
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: I just watched a guy dive across two lanes and like. Over the triangle part of an exit bc he was gonna miss it. Except he went through the dirt and hit debris. Then actually made it to the lane but instead of like. Breaking. The other car had to dodge sideways
And then the first idiot almost spun out bc he got a flat tire from the debris 
Amazing.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What a dumbass...
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: im just like. dude. take the next exit your dumbassery almost got ppl killed its EIGHT AM
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: ~~oh and at like 60mph at least this all happened*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just one of the many dumbasses who shouldn't have a drivers license...
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: agreed
