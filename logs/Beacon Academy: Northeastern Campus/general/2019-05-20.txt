Jamie (Jamie): i don't have enough cosplays for this, even though i have like nearing 40 wigs
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: i feel thats like. a crappy job desc. The more costumes you have the more likely you are to be hired yes but also like....... say the range of characters youre willing to do instead.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: It just sounds like. they want ppl but supply no costumes sounds kinda weird.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): There was a panel at katsucon a few years back from people who worked something like that. It was an 18+ panel and they got wasted drinking while recounting stories from work, and wound up doing nsfw face paint on the audience
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: i guess that went the way of the cosplay dating game with a story like that
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: RIP to Daci and chris who still dont think they can bring the dating game back to katsu bc of one dude who didnt understand it was improv
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: he thought he was actually....getting a date...
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: also apparently katsu fucked up and put a different dating game's description below it instead of theirs which clearly stated it was an improv show
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: ~~they told them they couldnt bring the panel there like.... 5 years ago i think an idiot still has them blocked from hosting it~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omg
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: its tragic because its a hysterical show
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Daci literally flys up from south carolina to host it at toracon
Jamie (Jamie): well damn that sucks and hope i can see it sometime
Jamie (Jamie): but on awesome news i killed my interview today
