Matt (mattmyers25): Yes
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thanks
Georgia (Something Sensible): adults, whats the difference between technical and computer skills
Georgia (Something Sensible): im tryna update resume and adulting is hard
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Computer skills would be like what kind of computer programs you're proficient in so like, Microsoft Office usually
Georgia (Something Sensible): ye and it seems technical is like machine shop stuff
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Kind of but I'm sure it encompasses other skills that you probably have. Like sewing is probably considered a technical skill but how that would aid you getting a job at NASA, I have no idea lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Technical skills are techniques. Object orientated design for CS.
