Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wish York would get cultured XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I WISH CENRAL PA WOULD GET CULTURED
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): And on this day the rwby cosplay fandom became the largest battlefield in history
Evie (Katheryne Knight): What have you all done XD
Jess (whoozica): *watches and feels sad cuz my entire county has no Wawa's and 1 Starbucks and like 40 Dunkins* 😭
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): We must save Jess from her plight
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Quick check tho
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have a coffee pot
Jess (whoozica): ~~I don't really care for QCs coffee~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): leanna keep that filthy excuse of a gas/grocery/thing out of this
Jess (whoozica): I make most my coffee at home
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’ll drink my own bean water
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Sheetz or Royal Farms I'd say are passable to enter the battlefield
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's fair, I dont like coffee in general xD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): but quickcheck isn't even as good as 7-11 lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ever heard of Rutters
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s shit
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I drink it anyway because it’s connected to my work
Jess (whoozica): Sheetz coffee is good! But I do think have any if those nearby either 😭
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Taking applications for new number one fan*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeeeah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fair, you were entitled to defend yourself.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But..Wawa???
WAWA
Ya can’t put Wawa against real chains with real food XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Starbucks and Dunkin are real food~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes they are
They at least exist all over the country
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eh, I still consider them fast food.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And that’s not real food.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This is how I know I’m old, I’m lost in these shenanigans.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Not with that attitude owo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Wawa I work at one ~♡ but starbucks has banging stuff
Marisa (Weeb): good mowning is this war over coffee or just chains in general
Marisa (Weeb): caffeine is a drug and drugs are illegal because if you do one you get teleported to prison
Marisa (Weeb): that emoji is crying in fear i'm glad you're taking this seriously
Matt (mattmyers25): Speaking of caffeine

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s not a public link Matt.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): RIP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Might be able to get verified yourselves now!

Matt (mattmyers25): Well that sucks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): sorry matt, facebook stuff is hard to share outside of FB often times lol
Marisa (Weeb): how is kidz bop still releasing albums and successful enough to do a 50-city US/Canada tour in the year 2018
Mak (hollyjollymak): Kidz bop is gonna cover despacito and I *know* that and I'm *still scared*
Marisa (Weeb): it's starting
Evie (Katheryne Knight): MAJOR OOF
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!229713389511901185> you and Chris were in Hershey recently right?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes! ^_^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You didn’t happen to visit the arboretum did you?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Nope >_<
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hmmu hmmu.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SO, i know spring is like ....REALLY far away but ....we should do a photo shoot at skyland manor in ringwood nj
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Where is Ringwood in NJ?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ummm its northern nj
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It would be a trip for Chris and I but I’m interested as long as I can plan ahead
Matt (mattmyers25): Its near the border with new York state
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.frungillo.com/venues/skylands-manor/gallery
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof 
It’s a trip but as I said I’m down as long as I plan ahead and we have a place to crash ^_^
Matt (mattmyers25): I agree with evie
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If there’s a spot for it my family has connections with the Hershey lodge. I bet I could get a really good group rate at the lodge. Lodge itself has some pretty areas, but indoor lighting isn’t something I’d want to entirely bank on. ~~Then again just cosplay take over in the chocolate capital is kinda cool~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^^^^^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Fuck I even mentioned going to Hershey Park in casual cosplay to Chris
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~Id have to cosplay a character with short hair so I don’t lose my wig~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I dunno if the park itself would make the most sense, or the surrounding area, potentially the arboretum...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeaaaj 
Definitely the surrounding area
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But with a cheap room block, it could be a minicon shtick.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> I clicked the link like there was some way I *wouldnt* be involved.
Matt (mattmyers25): My mom works at the hotel and the hotel has some nice areas like the gardens
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’d be in, obviously.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im down ^_^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Speaking of north jersey, <@!386874959009415170> <@!334090409389195266> <@!169297844874903552> sunflower maze.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): September is the time frame on that.
Erik (slendergiant): Was literally about to ask about that lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YE i'm down
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm down. Just give me a date so I can put it on my calendar~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): After CCE for sure.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Works for me 👌🏻 cause by then I won't be working weekends. Moving my "weekend" day from sat to fri evenings so I can do more stuff lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): they're super chill about photography, even online (usually online is vague and not detailed).
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Weekend after CCE is probably smartest. The week after that the maze is open, but that's the last week of the bloom.
Erik (slendergiant): I'm free that Saturday as well as Sunday afternoon
Georgia (Something Sensible): 👀
Georgia (Something Sensible): i am also free the sunday after CCE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 😏
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): I took an hour and a half
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): but I paid my respects to everyone I could think of in the coffee war
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): who has the taiyang "give me a hand" video?
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have one!
Georgia (Something Sensible): my phones dead tho ill send it when it rises from the dead again
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEET thank you!
Erik (slendergiant): I think it was Bill and Georgia
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Here ya go
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thank you!!!!!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMFAO 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): Erik's expression!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Erik's expression is a mood xD
