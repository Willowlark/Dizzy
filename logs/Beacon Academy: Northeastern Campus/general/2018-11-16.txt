Marisa (Weeb): 7/11 stopped selling taco rice again <:rip:378273525804433408> but they've got this really good new chocolate parfait ~~that'll probably also disappear in like a week or two~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So as I was pulling out of the Wawa parking lot, there was a car, a little sedan like me, whose trunk was opening up. I don't think the guy noticed, but we were stopped at a light and I thought maybe he'd get out to close it. Nope. Just left it wide open.
Jamie (Jamie): Apparently this was a thing that happened near me yesterday
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.google.com/amp/s/philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2018/11/15/camel-caught-on-video-in-snow-on-side-of-route-309-in-souderton/amp/
Mark (Mad Doctor): I love the Mystery Snow Camel so much it hurts
Jamie (Jamie): It apparently happened like 2 miles from my workplace after i left work lol
Jamie (Jamie): Been told it was on its way to a live nativity place
Marisa (Weeb): "The camel was headed to an event at the Kimmel Center for the Jewish Federation." he was just going to see a show and got stuck in the snow. probably had to walk or hail a taxi
Marisa (Weeb): "The camel’s name is Einstein."
Mark (Mad Doctor): What are the Uber rates for camel transit?
Marisa (Weeb): UUber because 2 humps
Erik (Red Riot Thot): UwUber
Mark (Mad Doctor): If I had seen it yesterday while I was stuck in traffic, I might have opened it up with my lightsaber, saying "And I thought they smelled bad on the outside..."
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, doubt it was for a nativity thing if it's the Jewish Federation 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCSiFIHtpGM
Jamie (Jamie): Lol thats true 😂 my coworker new d's to check his facts haha
Jamie (Jamie): *needs
Marisa (Weeb): newds
nudes??
arrested
Marisa (Weeb): pokemon time.
when my eevee laughs my acne goes away and my heart is purified
Marisa (Weeb): it makes noises like a gremlin i love him
Erik (Red Riot Thot): fuck it, I'm probably going to download the game today
Marisa (Weeb): it's neat
Marisa (Weeb): very novel
Marisa (Weeb): i'm glad i set my language to english, i was gonna play in japanese but got lazy at the last minute and i'm really glad i chose english because of reason.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've never played any Pokemon game past Sapphire. Are the mechanics relatively the same in the newer versions? I think I read that now you don't *have* to interact with wild Pokemon?
Marisa (Weeb): i can talk more in spoilers if you want i don't want to say anything if people are going in blind
Marisa (Weeb): original sapphire or alpha sapphire?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I preordered it, but I have to go to the mailbox to get it.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): OG Sapphire
Erik (Red Riot Thot): for GBA
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 😂
Marisa (Weeb): omg that's forever ago
Marisa (Weeb): sun and moon had a super long, like 2 hour tutorial that I'm glad didn't become a recurring thing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Any Pokemon after that I'm basically oblivious to other than maybe starters and ones featured in memes lol
Marisa (Weeb): i wonder if mega evolution are in Lets Go? probably not
Marisa (Weeb): i'm gonna post some of the game basics in spoilers for anyone who wants to know
Erik (Red Riot Thot): also, while we're on the topic of Nintendo, it's Shigeru Miyamoto's birthday today
Marisa (Weeb): i get him and iwata mixed up
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lol I was going to ask "why the 'RIP' emoji? he's still alive" xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh you know what... maybe I'll wait a week and see if it's on sale for Black Friday
Erik (Red Riot Thot): usually do my 10pm Best Buy run after we get home from Thanksgiving
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): USPS needs to get here with mine.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~work~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~what work~~
Jess (whoozica): They're probably still dealing with the after math of snow
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~that's why I mainly do digital downloads lol I'm impatient as fuck~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): lol USPS doesn't come here till around 12.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So they aren't late, I'm impatient too.
Jess (whoozica): USPS comes at all times of the day and night here. Sometimes they come at 7:30 in the morning and sometimes they come at 6:00 at night
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So I like digital download these days... but for Switch it felt right to get cartridges for a nintendo system and now I have 10 so it's like...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't wanna switch. (ha)
Marisa (Weeb): cartridges the way to goo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They do that here too. Same as normal mail .-. Cause we never have the same mailman lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My case has a bunch of slots for cartridges that I'm never going to use
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, I just discovered yesterday that they released a YouTube app in the store
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yeah, that came out a few days ago.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *And* in case anyone hasn't figured this out yet, if you're at a hotel (or anywhere that requires connecting to wifi via a browser) I found that if your phone has mobile hotspot/wifi sharing, you can just connect with your phone, set up your hotspot, and then connect your Switch to that. That's what I did when I was in Austin lol
Marisa (Weeb): i've tried that but it didn't work too well 😭
Marisa (Weeb): can be finnicky sometimes
Marisa (Weeb): or maybe i had no idea what i was doing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it probably mostly depends on the wifi connection
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but it's at least a nice workaround since there's no browser
Marisa (Weeb): so glad i chose english
Marisa (Weeb): i'm enjoying this game a lot more than any of the other recent titles
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm going to love and adore my eevee till I die.
Marisa (Weeb): my bulbasaur also just did the cutest thing ever
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I don't know if anyone is even going to get pikachu~~
Marisa (Weeb): my classmate did
Marisa (Weeb): nerd
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Question, how does one get their Eevee to have bangs, and are you going to do it?
Marisa (Weeb): probably a hairdresser somewhere. i just got to a new city and i'm really hoping there's gonna be a clothing store here because i want glasses for my character ~~and my eevee~~. in older games there were places you could get your furfrou (dog pokemon)'s fur styled all fancy.
Marisa (Weeb): There were also stores you could collect and try on clothes. There were a looot of options. I also want to change my characters hair and that was possible in the past
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I like that you can customize your character a bit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm a slut for character customization xD
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH sun and moon had such good customization i really hope they brought it back
Marisa (Weeb): clothing stores in different cities would sell different clothes on different days of the week
Marisa (Weeb): like shore towns had hawaiian shirts and the city had mega expensive suits
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I also hope there are different options for bangs
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because I want this Eevee
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Not this one...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Marisa (Weeb): oh ye there's definitely at least 3 or 5 hairstyles
Marisa (Weeb): are you guys gonna name your pokemon
Marisa (Weeb): Biru what’d you do this time
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fused my face onto a rat.
Marisa (Weeb): me: uses 50 potions during a battle
enemy: uses one berry
me: that's not fair you can't do that it's cheating
Marisa (Weeb): remember pokemon Colosseum where you could just steal people's pokemon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't know if I'm going to get mine today rip.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): watch it show up tomorrow as we're on the ferry
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Probably.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What happened to wind nor snow nor sleet nor hail.
Jess (whoozica): They're tryin brah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oof. I wanna get the digital download, but I also don't want to deal with returning the physical copy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oops.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): +1 impulse for bill
Jess (whoozica): Why is that not a counter?
Jess (whoozica): Cuz like I think we're up to 3 just this week
Erik (Red Riot Thot): did you buy the digital? xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeeeee. I can’t think of a single reason Jess.
Jess (whoozica): Call out post for tltwm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tlt_wm called lit as trash. <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): tlt_wm: The Lit Trash _ Weeb Man
Jess (whoozica): YES
Jess (whoozica): That's what it stands for
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Imma go die real quick.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Update: I found that song I was thinking of yesterday
Erik (Red Riot Thot): looking through old screenshots on my phone and I came across this gem from 3 years ago
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I just got paid 45$ to watch a baby for two hours so that his dad could hide upstairs and play video games 😂
Matt (mattmyers25): Nice lol
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): As i was leaving he goes “don’t tell his mother” 🤣😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): $22.50/hr, that's not bad
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wait, I can do that?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Normally they pay 15$ an hour, this was hush money
Matt (mattmyers25): <@327835140216586242> you are providing a valuable service
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'll pay for three hours or until I get Play of the Game...I'll pay for six hours
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~I’m on my way~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Heisburg’s Diamonds is doing a promotion where if you spend 1200 dollars on a diamond ring you get a free Nintendo switch
Georgia (Something Sensible): Just in case anyone needed that extra incentive to get married today 😂
Matt (mattmyers25): Who will be the next couple to get engaged?
Georgia (Something Sensible): My money is theoretically on whoever has the longest and most stable relationship right now
Georgia (Something Sensible): Obviously besides those who have already Put a Ring on It™️
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you already have a switch does that mean you can’t get married. 😱
Jess (whoozica): DAMN too bad we missed that
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Buy the ring, get free switch, return ring tomorrow, keep switch 😈
Georgia (Something Sensible): Would that actually work, assuming you had 1200 to blow for a day? 🤔
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Couples break up, these things happen
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): As long as you spin a convincing sob story you should be good
Georgia (Something Sensible): “Sir I walked in on my girlfriend being bukake’d by 10 guys can I please just return the ring? Oh... the switch? Yeah no that. That also was. Getting bukake’d you don’t want that anymore”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Good story, definitely convincing 👌
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): There ya go!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t want to know why that’s your first thought for a sob story breakup.
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s like when you call out of work by saying you have violent diahrrea
Georgia (Something Sensible): No one WANTS to ask anymore questions
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bukake is the same way
Georgia (Something Sensible): The jeweler doesn’t wanna know anymore past that
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): When in doubt, blame bukake
Jess (whoozica): They'd prob make you either pay for the switch or return it tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~No normal jewelry store employee even knows what that is~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s the beauty of it
Georgia (Something Sensible): He isn’t sure he WANTS to know
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You just have to reveal yourself as a Japanese flavor pervert to a complete stranger!
Halim (Greg): "Look if you really want to know my girlfriend is caked in the seed of other men I'm having a rough time right now"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Caked right in her cake
Georgia (Something Sensible): Forget the bukake story that’s all you need to say
Georgia (Something Sensible): My girlfriend got caked in the cake by TEN MEN
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ooo double penetration too erik
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IN MY CHRISTIN NEIGHBORHOOD
Halim (Greg): IN FRONT OF MY SALAD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 🥗🥗🥗
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 🍑🍑🍑
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "She got caked right on the cake by... uhh..."
*~sees a Five Guys bag in the trash~*
"...uh... five guys! It was horrible!"
