Mark (Mad Doctor): Cosplans? How much is a used accordion?
Marisa (Weeb): if it a real accordion, expensive.
one time my sister found an accordion in the trash. she saw a neat looking case and trash picked it and found an accordion inside, so she put it in the back seat. then while we were driving she didn't see a stop sign and got pulled over by a cop. my sister has a lot of tattoos and at the time may have sported a mohawk. the cop was asking a bunch of questions, and peering into the windows. she sees a totally typical black case in the back that could be literally anything and goes "oh, you have an accordion? cool! i'll let you off with a warning this time but drive safely."
Mark (Mad Doctor): Behold its power!
Erik (slendergiant): My mom's dad used to have an accordion
