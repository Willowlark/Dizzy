jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Adam is going ghost
Marisa (Weeb): smorgasbord.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): https://store.roosterteeth.com/collections/rwby/products/rwby-qrows-flask 
Yesss ðŸ‘Œ
Matt (mattmyers25): Do I buy it?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ 100% yes XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jesus RT, 
https://store.roosterteeth.com/products/rwby-yangs-aviator-sunglasses
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): why
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 50 dollars for basically... a glasses case with yangs emblem ~~and sunglasses i could get for much cheaper~~
Jess (whoozica): OOF
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes...
Erik (slendergiant): Lowkey, I could probably make that glasses case for much cheeper...
Matt (mattmyers25): Agreed. 20 for the flask isnt too bad
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Some of the merch is reasonably priced and others is like outrageously priced...
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah, the flask is more reasonably priced
Matt (mattmyers25): Aka you could make it cheaper than if you bought it
Erik (slendergiant): But those plushies should definitely be like $10... based on my experience with Zwei
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed
Erik (slendergiant): $50 for bluetooth headphones? Reasonable
Erik (slendergiant): also, that glasses case would probably not protect your sunglasses from getting crushed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): definitely would not
Erik (slendergiant): I'll take my $5 aviators from Walmart with a hard case I have lying around thank you very much
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Hopefully the flask wrapping isn't crapply attached. I've seen some bad work at con booths, and I have little reason to expect RT would do better.
Matt (mattmyers25): Ill buy it to show you all
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Our hero*
Matt (mattmyers25): The hero we dont deserve
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol Matt be our test subject with it XD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Unless those are actual Aviator brand sunglasses, wtf.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Though the case *is* nice.
Matt (mattmyers25): Who will buy the glasses?
Erik (slendergiant): Once I get a 3D printer I could probably print out plastic stamps and make one myself xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): No one Matt XDD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): if it's leather it might be a decent case.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~those plush are *terrrifying* oh my god~~
Erik (slendergiant): It's still soft though so if it gets sat on or crushed, the glasses are probably still going to snap
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The plushies are always terrifying XD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!351785752197201920> If you don't buy it *someone* here is going to get it for your birthday, you may as well save us the money.
Erik (slendergiant): The plushie *humans* are terrifying. Zwei and Mwack turned out alright
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oh wow that's not even new, did no one think this?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): so Rebecca, where's my 'we're sorry we made you salty' merch?
Erik (slendergiant): I thought we pointed the apron out to Tom when it came out? lol
Jess (whoozica): im annoyed noras Bluetooth headphones arent canon accurate XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It wasn't RWBY so hold up and lemme find it XD. Cause I was only looking at RWBY atm
Rebecca (madameterralupus): https://store.roosterteeth.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/achievement-hunter-salt-tee-t-shirt?variant=12429160710192
<@!184437198865563648>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Are they not?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): cute. If I didn't dislike achievement hunter I'd consider it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): shit yeah they ain't canon at all.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): https://store.roosterteeth.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/camp-camp-campe-diem-flag

Jess (whoozica): lmao
Jess (whoozica): the hair?

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nicu!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): if the leather is nice ~~and it's not smaller than my other flasks~~ I'll have to get one to.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~or I can get a Qrow snapback to be the douchebag I always dreamed I was~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Why not both ðŸ˜› lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *I've never dreamed I was a douchebag tho*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i want that salty shirt hoooooly shit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dodnt even watch achievement hunter
Matt (mattmyers25): All the salt
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I'm salty the shirt is from a show I don't want to rep~~
Erik (slendergiant): it's generic enough that you could wear it without anyone knowing what it was from
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Weiss, currently being consumed by her own forehead*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They need a better product photographer.
Jess (whoozica): thanks for the nightmares
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *This is all I am now. Forehead.*

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The Cold One
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Cinder, probably some time in vol 5: gonna crack open a cold one with the boys
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *NoOOo*
Jess (whoozica): OMG
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ALTERNATIVELY to the All Consuming Forehead:
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They apparently decided it's all good if her skirt is half up.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): She trying to get in on that bellabooty. <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): "I'm the Yang, lets fight"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I expect you to go up to everyone at CCE and say that Leanna.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in every cosplay except for yang
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): pfft sure.
Erik (slendergiant): *"I'M THE 2B, LET'S FIGHT"*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also I can't break the RWBY loops canon for Zwei and Torchwick in Chibi...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): .....this works surprisingly well for my secret cosplay LMAO
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): "My cricket is pretty good too" That's a vine.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *I see why Ruby and Penny got together in the loops after that chibi skit tho*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Qrow: "And then Tai walks in without pants, and we all yell 'surprise'." <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The water bottle gag is ascended fanon~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Is this BNHA?*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's his Tokoyami cosplay XD
Jess (whoozica): OMG
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 1. This hat is not optional for future Ozpin cosplay
