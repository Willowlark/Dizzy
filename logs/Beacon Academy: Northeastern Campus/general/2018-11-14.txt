Tom (tomukuncosplay): many feelings ðŸ˜¢ It hurts a bit knowing well never have the *monty* fights back
Marisa (Weeb): my classmate kept me after class for a bit to complain about her son. she was like "I wanted a *kakkoii* son but instead he's just an *otaku*" and the whole time I was like " <:lenny:456549338026344489> "
