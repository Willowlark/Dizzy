Georgia (Something Sensible): Woohoo take over the location!
Georgia (Something Sensible): Forget chestnut hill, it's WEEB SCHOOL now
Georgia (Something Sensible): Can you imagine: you  labor for two hours to get your dorm set up, and take a picture and post it
Georgia (Something Sensible): And you're so excited to get top likes
Georgia (Something Sensible): And some MEME has surpassed your posts popularity at your OWN college
Georgia (Something Sensible): My mom was like: "this video is so wholesome I've watched it a couple times at work"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's so cute holy shit?
Erik (slendergiant): So a few days ago I saw a deal for almost the Jackbox collection for $12 so naturally I hopped on it (feel free to add to the counter)

https://giphy.com/gifs/napoleon-solo-1GFopn0FCJuBW
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): I rest my case
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): the blonde curly hair never works
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): theres a reason JT keeps his hair short
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): and a reason he stopped dying it
Mark (Mad Doctor): From my generation...
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): less he have long locks of gold, a mans hair should never be so bold
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You’d be a great blonde, 10/10 ign.
Georgia (Something Sensible): OMG YOURE VOMIT BOY NOW
Georgia (Something Sensible): THATS TOO GOOD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): if yall call me vomit boy I will be upset
Mark (Mad Doctor): We're sitting on the campus of Temple University while Mrs Mad D interviews for a job. Turns out they have a course on cosplay
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey is intrigued
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Temple would be the school for that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m so tempted to go there for Grad School
Evie (Katheryne Knight): For theater
Jess (whoozica): my cousin went there, i think thats the school marisa does her study abroad in japan with too
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Temple is just...ack I should have gone there instead of West Chester XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s what got Marisa to Japan yes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~It also has a wild party school reputation~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): What school doesn’t now a days XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, it’s a VERY big party school.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): People from Rowan (my college) would drive there just to get to a party.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I bet especially where it’s located
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Hi Party school you called me?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Temple apparently XD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): excuse me
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Temple can talk all they want but UD will always reign supreme
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But Delaware doesn’t exist.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): According to my Boss.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Delaware doesn't exist
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): but theres a 95 path from NJ to Maryland
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): and UD is off of it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): the Delaware in the name refers to the river
Erik (slendergiant): Ok, so "interview" thing went well. The email said it was supposed to be a 30-60 minute interview to go over my qualifications but it ended up being like a 6 minute chat going over my resume. I then have to submit an application and take a personality and skills assessment. Apparently there's math involved so I'm hoping it's nothing too difficult because what's a calculus again?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yo I never want to do hard math again.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's not a bad sign, my phone interview for my job was pretty quick.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Wow it's crazy how much older people don't know technology
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I know it's cause I grew up with it, but my mom is trying to use the company Facebook page and just doesn't "get" some things
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like "what is the posts tab for?" kinda studf
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *if only she was instagram famous*
Jess (whoozica): i have to try to explain it to a 90 yr old ona regular basis
Erik (slendergiant): probably about a decade ago, we got my grandparents a cell phone and having to explain using the arrow keys to "scroll down the menu" was a time
Erik (slendergiant): *"WHAT'S 'SQUIRRELING'???"*
Erik (slendergiant): 🤦🏻
Jess (whoozica): earlier, my boss asked my coworker to print him the google results
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah we have a lot of older customoers at my job that their lives would be easier if they knew how to use the mobile application for their banking.

Also you would not believe how many elderly people get their bank accounts hacked because they open a bad email, or answer a scam call.
