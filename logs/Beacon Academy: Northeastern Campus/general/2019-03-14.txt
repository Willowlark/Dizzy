Georgia (Something Sensible): _matt no the 50s did not look kindly on flannel_

Georgia (Something Sensible): Ye she’s in high school
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XDD lmao the complete opposite. Glad they like you though! That's always good. I always worry of an SO's parents not liking me lol. And ahh okay. Pretty cool extra credit for HS... I wish we had an extra credit like that xD
