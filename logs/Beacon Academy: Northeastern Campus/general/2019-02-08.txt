Evie (Katheryne Knight): Orangy boi
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That part I know <@229713389511901185> when  you're recording, there's the option to change the speed so it adjusts the speed of the audio while you're recording and then when you're done it readjusts back so the audio is normal and your video is sped up or slowed down
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Selecting 2x will half the audio when you're recording so your video will be twice as fast
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOOOOOOOO

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am so glad more of you have joined tik tok~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I'm cadmiumcos I have no content tho
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Omfg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I am still learning some things on the app but if any one ever has questions on the app hit me up lol. I've been using it for like a year and a half so know some of the functions?~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Erik. 
Can you hear me groaning at your puns from here 
Those. Are so bad.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Why did you pic that clip
Anna (loud and likely blonde): My soul escaped from my body
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The end part where we can see you turning off the video is honestly the biggest dad mood though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That like brings it all together
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I hope that part was intentional
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I didn't know how to edit that out...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It wouldn't let me trim the video
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I think. You can move the slider to make it shorter.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~just claim it's intentional~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am assuming the audio was your own? If not you can set the timer and it'll end filming for ya
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Wait can you not edit after it's finished?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Once fully posted?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Not that I am aware of
Rebecca (madameterralupus): As for once done filming and before posted. Unsure. Looking now
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah doesn't seem like you can trim the video. You have to set the tine for the exact amount of time you want to shoot for... which is dumb
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea like I know if you record, then stop and record again you can delete the last recording but doesn't seem trimming is an option for video. Only sound O.o
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Which is why I want to know how people do custom audio. I tried looking up tutorials but they're literally all 10 year old girls who have no fucking clue how to make a tutorial video
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao yeaaa ~~And they shouldnt even be on it cause I think the app is like 13 plus LOL~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea messing around a but no way to trim video... only audio.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Da fuqqq tik tok
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Honestly it's probs like. Pre filmed videos you trim in your photo app and then upload and download and keep doing that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Imma experiment this weekend and figure it out lol'
Jamie (Jamie): Wow yea you usee to havea way to upload your own audio clips and it doesnt show anymore? Wtf
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Weird.
Jamie (Jamie): Also tai doing "mr.mom" ~~which lonestar did apparently pretty sure they covered it though~~ would be kinda awesome

Anna (loud and likely blonde): The your own clip is the square to the side of the record button
Jamie (Jamie): Holy crap my head is so cloudy right now from medicines for pains but somehow insomnia is still winning and I wont pass out
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I am so flipping exhausted rn

Mark (Mad Doctor): Just a reminder that Trump's former press secretary is  likely to be there. Rumor has it that he was wearing full body armor last year and attended incognito.  He also donned a fursuit during the 2nd Bush administration to portray the Easter Bunny  at the annual egg roll
