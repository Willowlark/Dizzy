Marisa (Weeb): wihch is harder and sturdier to use as a weapon. stale bread or frozen.
Erik (slendergiant): Frozen
Marisa (Weeb): b r e a d f i g h t
do u have a source
Erik (slendergiant): It was revealed to me in a dream
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd say frozen too. Cause harder and wouldn't break as quick. Some stale bread can still be soft in spots meaning it'd break <--- There's my source üòù
Marisa (Weeb): what if stale and frozen combined? is that the ultimate form or a downgrade
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao. I'd say it'd be no different than just frozen tbh
Marisa (Weeb): frozen reigns supreme
Marisa (Weeb): thank ny'all for your scientific assistance, your nobel prizes are on their way
Marisa (Weeb): forget jack o' lanterns. this year's halloween mood is racing down a river inside hollowed out pumpkin carcasses.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol what...
Marisa (Weeb): prepare yourself
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I.... Man I hate having to carve out a normal pumpkin... I wouldn't want to carve out one of these suckers XD ~~Although they probably use more proper tools/machinery lol~~
Marisa (Weeb): maybe if you ask the pumpkin nicely it will disembowel itself
ZombieHunter: Monopoly. Kink edition.
Marisa (Weeb): if you buy this, interpol manifests in your living room and waits for you to get home
ZombieHunter: Lmao
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I think stale and frozen bread actually makes it worse cuz it's dry so less water to freeze
Marisa (Weeb): i was at a party once where there was a huge argument over whether cold water or hot water freezes faster
Tom (tomukuncosplay): How... Is that an argument
Marisa (Weeb): so they boiled some water and put some cold water and hot water in the freezer
Marisa (Weeb): people were ready to throw down over it
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Actually can't even talk my mom thought that cold water boiled faster than hot water
Tom (tomukuncosplay): We did the experiment as well
Marisa (Weeb): what was the result
Marisa (Weeb): the fighters were too drunk to experiment properly
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <:lenny:456549338026344489> well golly gee that'd spoil.the mystery
Tom (tomukuncosplay): AHH DELETED IT BY ACCIDENT
Marisa (Weeb): MYSTERY REVOKED??
Marisa (Weeb): AAAAA
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Ahhhhhhhhhh
Tom (tomukuncosplay): They put the delete button where the edit button should have been and there's no undoing I guess
Marisa (Weeb): post it again. we can rebuild it. better and stronger.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): aaabcd?!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I WILL
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I must look really fucking stoned
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cause i just drove the a mcdonalds
Tom (tomukuncosplay): "<:lenny:456549338026344489> Well golly gee that'd spoil the mystery" -Tom Oct 2018 1 minute prior
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): And after handing me my drink, the drive through lady thought she needed to remind me not to leave without my debit card
Marisa (Weeb): there we go. it's fine. everything is fine. *it's fine and nothing is wrong.*
Marisa (Weeb): jess u gotta react again u have to
Marisa (Weeb): did you leave your debit card <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): [leaves it at the mcdonalds to spite the lady]
Marisa (Weeb): that'll show her
Marisa (Weeb): *now it's perfect*
Marisa (Weeb): ~~inb4 it gets deleted again~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Lol of course i took my debit card, 
Spites not worth not having my munies
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> My last class of the day was cancelled! Wooo that means I can go home early and rest before  work
Erik (slendergiant): Still no new DLC for GE...

Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~so gotta search for coupons for those places lol~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Also guys just a heads up, every coupon that is sent to someone by email/app/whatever has a different bar code so you can share coupons with ppl to collect more
Marisa (Weeb): ~~self plug oops~~
~~my mother collects and repairs and sells vintage sewing machines, like up to a hundred years old, and she had a ton of old sewing and embroidery machines for sale if anyone is interested. all are in working condition and they're insane workhorses but most are for collectors i believe though.~~
Marisa (Weeb): collectible trading bar codes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): üëÄ  are they hella expensive, marisa?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): THAT MEANS MULITPLE COUPONS GIRL
Marisa (Weeb): lemme check with her
Jess (whoozica): <@!351785752197201920>  u need anything from joanns?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i have too many sewing machines and mannequins.. ~~never enough tho, still need an embroidery one~~
Jess (whoozica): Me yesterday: "ive been spending too much on cosplay"
Joanns: <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (slendergiant): Would an embroidery machine fall under this?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also still have that mannequin for you jess, i'll bring it to georgias on halloween?
Jess (whoozica): yes please! ‚ù§
Marisa (Weeb): i sent her a text she'll respond soon. she also has a booth in a shop, here's a picture i stole from the website where you can see some machines on the bottom right along the shelf
Marisa (Weeb): it's like a permanent flea market shop
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ..i ...wanna go
Marisa (Weeb): oo machines are all along the bottom i just noticed lol
it's a neat place! good if you like antiques since each booth is different. you can see a general map of what is sold in each booth here, BoJo's is booth B4
https://www.carnivalofcollectables.com/current-dealers-map
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yoooooo this is right up my alley
Marisa (Weeb): **permanent flea market**
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I MUST GO
Marisa (Weeb): i like to sell keychains and bows and video game pillows and whatnot. the booths are super reasonably priced if there's ever an opening and every month or two they have big garage-sale-esque events where they'll sell stuff outside too
Marisa (Weeb): ~~i'm biding time until i get a response text~~
Marisa (Weeb): omg the embroidery machines we have are so outdated i can barely find pictures of them online rip
Marisa (Weeb): a newer model would probably be better but if anyone is ever interested in a dinosaur
Marisa (Weeb): 
Marisa (Weeb): 
Marisa (Weeb): we have like 30 of those models
Marisa (Weeb): they come with CDs of the embroidery software! works on windows 95!
Marisa (Weeb): yeah, there's probably no interest but BoJo says their going price is $150 and she'll include a private lesson on how to properly use all its functions
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): üòÆ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ill probably just stop by the booth
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im old fashion anyway, maybe i'll like them LOL

Erik (slendergiant): NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WTF HOW DARE
Erik (slendergiant): ```Currently-airing simulcasts and series that premiered during the partnership will continue to be available on Crunchyroll, including favorites like Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia.```
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): BUT STILL
Erik (slendergiant): Does that mean we'll still get both subs and dubs of BNHA? Or nah?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Idk at least for bnha crunchyroll only had the sub and funimation only does the dub
Erik (slendergiant): because that's really the only show I currently care about because I watched both, and the reason I switched to VRV was so I could watch both while only paying for one service üòÖ
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Guess if I want to watch BNHA it's torrents like usual.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Tho, cause I really don't care much dub would probably better...
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): The first time I watch a new episode I use the sub because it‚Äôs out sooner and I have ZERO patience. But I always like the dubs for rewatches so this throughs a wrench in that
Erik (slendergiant): I like the sub for the original voices, but I like the dubs so I can watch it while doing other things and not have to *read*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): THAT^
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): A MOOD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): bakuhoes voice is ALOT gruffer and just over all sounds more angry in the sub and I like that
Erik (slendergiant): I like Aizawa's Japanese voice better
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I prefer sub overall tho i like dubs "Deku!!!!" From bakuhoe
Erik (slendergiant): he sounds more like he gives zero fucks
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Right???
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Also the dub of 02 from darling was AWFUL
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I could barely watch it her voice grated my ears
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *All dubs are trash*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Not necessarily, I prefer dubs for when I‚Äôm working on cosplay or doing something else because it‚Äôs easier to follow along with having my eyes glued to the screen. But when I watch something for the first time I almost always watch the sub
Erik (slendergiant): that hard R in English da**r**ling sounds awful
Jess (whoozica): MOOD
Erik (slendergiant): The Japanese **dah**ling sounds so much better
Jess (whoozica): i wanna watch so many animes but i cant do ANYTHING while i watch
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): daRling instead of dAArling
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): that makes watching a dub more convenient to you. Doesn't make the dub not trash.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): This is true
Jess (whoozica): they are trash, thats why i just dont get anything done
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *anime is also trash but*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Not all dub are trash
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): FMA and FMA B has really good dub
Jess (whoozica): plz give good dubs hal i need to do stuff
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): You gotta give the dub a try first before you watch a shows sub tho 
Cause once you listen to the subbed version dub will always sound off
Jess (whoozica): mmm you right
Jess (whoozica): did you watch forest of piano in English or Japanese? cuz i was thinking of watching it
Erik (slendergiant): I'll agree to that. Whichever you watch first, the other will sound weird
Jess (whoozica): i feel like i ussually watch netflix animes in english
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I think i watched it in english first?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Idk ive watched it in both all the way through while also reading the manga
Jess (whoozica): cool i think imma watch it soon, you said its really good right?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I love it 
The music is amazing
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): My only complaint is that i wish it took a little more time with things
Jess (whoozica): ah, well ill prob give it a shot soon üëå
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Applying for an apartment with friends
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I‚Äôm so stoked

Evie (Katheryne Knight): So we basically have applied and we just have to send in our paperwork and hopefully get approved
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I‚Äôm super nervous
Erik (slendergiant): You got this!
