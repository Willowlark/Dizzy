Matt (mattmyers25): Notre Dame in Paris is on fire
Mark (Mad Doctor): Holy hell...
Georgia (Something Sensible): _thats a 850 year old building_
Jess (whoozica): 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): holy crap its like SERIOUSLY on fire, not just like a small fire
Mark (Mad Doctor): I absolutely love gothic architecture. This breaks my heart
Matt (mattmyers25): Yes. The roof is on fire
Matt (mattmyers25): Maybe linked to renovation work
Mark (Mad Doctor): *hot glue accident*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh wow.... that's upsetting
Erik (Red Riot Thot): during Holy Week too 😢
Georgia (Something Sensible): i remember visiting there
Georgia (Something Sensible): its really impressive
Georgia (Something Sensible): especially for standing for so long
Jamie (Jamie): That is legitamately sad to see happening. 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....the whole spire fell, wow im sad
Jess (whoozica): oh my god, no 😦 ugh this is so das
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Alexa play despacito~~
Matt (mattmyers25): All the wood inside is apparently destroyed. Fire crews are trying to save the artwork
Georgia (Something Sensible): i mean
Georgia (Something Sensible): at least the stained glass should be okay?
Anna (blonde and sad): Nope
Anna (blonde and sad): Stained glass metal bits have lots of lead
Georgia (Something Sensible): glass cant melt in general though cant it?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): glass blows out almost immediately upon water touching it in a fire
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): fuck
Anna (blonde and sad): Glass definitely melts
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea glass melts
Anna (blonde and sad): That's how they get it in shapes. It's got a p high temperature but like. Unless they can get the fire out it's gonna be bad
Anna (blonde and sad): Is the fire at the side with the giant circle window?
Georgia (Something Sensible): doesnt look like it?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think it might be
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's right where that spire used to be
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): pretty much the whole thing is in flames, most of the ceiling's collapsed
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh yeah
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://previews.123rf.com/images/dibrova/dibrova1110/dibrova111000045/10749024-notre-dame-de-paris-front-view-.jpg
Georgia (Something Sensible): the front bit that everyone sees in pictures is okay ~~for now~~
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): oh great trump's talking about it now
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): "rennovation, what's that all about?" - trump
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): truly inspiring
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm watching the ABC feed and someone was commenting on his tweet about combating it with aerial water tankers and they said that even if they had access to those, the water would probably cause even more damage
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeeeeeeeeeeeep
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats how you break the stained glass
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which i imagine they are trying to save
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not to mention water damage
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): would also destroy the relics
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh just heard one of the towers is now on fire 😢
Anna (blonde and sad): I feel this is a sign god is angry
Matt (mattmyers25): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): im not even french and this is absolutely heartbreaking
Georgia (Something Sensible): it must be so much worse for the people who live there and take pride in such a landmark
Erik (Red Riot Thot): seeing it zoomed in is even more heart-breaking
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): THE GARGOYLES ARE FALLING
Mark (Mad Doctor): Poor Quasimodo
Georgia (Something Sensible): no deaths reported, so he mustve made it out ok
Georgia (Something Sensible): awww i still have some of the photos from when i visited
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cathedrale avec poseur (2004)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The live feed I'm watching is really eery. Just shots of the church on fire with ambient wind hitting the microphone
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm catching up on this and omg this is so depressing 😭 did they say what caused it?
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): they think it was related to the renovation work (power tool accidentally sparking a fire) but they haven't confirmed it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh damn 😭
Matt (mattmyers25): I have heard the saved the holy relics from the church
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): oh they yeah lol i just came to say that <:fingerguns:453385855470534657> 
they said they took some of the paintings and stuff out
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good good 🙏🏻
Mark (Mad Doctor): I worry about the stained glass. A cathedral like that transforms you when you enter it, and the experience of the light is a big part of that
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): even if the glass stays intact/unmelted it's already been damaged by the fire and smoke
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
Matt (mattmyers25): The north tower could collapse so they are working to save it
Mark (Mad Doctor): Where are you getting your info? I'm shouting at the screen every time they butcher history on CNN
Matt (mattmyers25): BBC
Matt (mattmyers25): They have a live feed on there website
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thanks
Mark (Mad Doctor): "This Cathedral survived revolutions, wars, crusades..."
*Of course it survived crusades, you nimrods! The nearest crusade was against the Albigensians, and they were Christian heretics, so it hardly counts!*
sorry...
Matt (mattmyers25): And this is why I like the bbc
Mark (Mad Doctor): Watching now. Seriously, they're blowing American news out of the water. To paraphrase Jefferson: at least they know where France is
Anna (blonde and sad): I'm actually afraid for the structural integrity of the whole thing I can't remember at what point in architecture the cathedal was designed or reinforced
Matt (mattmyers25): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good news. As for the structure, I remember hearing about the building of St. John the Divine in NYC in the 20th century. The initial plan was to built it entirely using medieval techniques, but New York denied the permits until they agreed to add steel reinforcements.   So my guess is that ND de Paris is nothing but stone.
Mark (Mad Doctor): They had to invent new engineering principles to build those early gothic cathedrals, and they tested them through trial and error (Amiens Cathedral collapsed four times before they got it right).  Really amazing buildings. One of my favorite periods to teach
Matt (mattmyers25): 
Matt (mattmyers25): Praise god
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): http://johannesviii.tumblr.com/post/184210749144/johannesviii-johannesviii-johannesviii
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): good post about the cathedral and the way everyone thinks everything is lost forever
ZombieHunter: more on this
ZombieHunter: 
ZombieHunter: same thing
ZombieHunter: i'm in class so i cant open the link link lol
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): the screenshot is better because on desktop the blog post gets all smooshed
ZombieHunter: yaaaaay i'm helping
ZombieHunter: xD
Mark (Mad Doctor): A tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse. And no one was killed.
Anna (blonde and sad): It is just very shocking at how much can be destroyed so quickly but honestly isn't it a new thing relatively that  buildings stay undamaged? I feel historically stuff used to burn down much more frequently
ZombieHunter: <@!245270932602486784>  <@!170686358535274497> lets plan a homestuck photo shoot
ZombieHunter: s i n
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~Marisa prob would want in on that :o~~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: YES
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The Onion already put out a post that was, in my opinion, in *very* poor taste #SaltyCatholic
Georgia (Something Sensible): o rly?
Georgia (Something Sensible): already/
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yikes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): There's somethings I don't think the onion should post about/make jokes on...
Jess (whoozica): Yea I just saw it, valid erik
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just read it too. And mhmmm... yeaa... 😬
Georgia (Something Sensible): it was not very tasteful but also just not funny either
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea... not good. Like ok I recognize that the onion makes satire that often is distasteful and offensive. But this is a serious catastrophe with a lot of signigicate religious meaning. This is not the time or place to spew this kind of "joke"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed. This is not a joking matter cause it can be very offensive and even more upsetting than stuff already is to those who are religious... Like I read it and just mhmm no. I didn't find it funny and it rubbed me the wrong way a bit.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Exactly
Matt (mattmyers25): There are photos from inside the church. The inside of the church was almost untouched. Only a part of the roof collapsed in the main part of the church
Jess (whoozica): Onion needs to lay off. Catholics have suffered enough for the day
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I dont even  have a religion and it rubbed me wrong. It's just super disrespectful and wrong
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm glad to hear that matt
Matt (mattmyers25): Also, screw the onion
Anna (blonde and sad): Oof that is in poor taste. Might have been like slightly acceptable if it was like "Jesus Christ thanks firefighters for saving his house" but uhhhhh no. That. Not okay.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeeee
Anna (blonde and sad): i made it back to upstate so i can say. i survived the weekend
Anna (blonde and sad): my cat says hello
