ZombieHunter: just the bee fight
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fucking wow
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They portrayed him that way... because... that's what his character is...
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~sometimes i wonder how certain leaders came to power and then sometimes i am able to glimpse into the thought process of  people like this!!
Anna (loud and likely blonde): "despite his extremist tendencies" *see i think you and I are not putting the same weight on certain traits he displays*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"morally gray character"*
*He plans to blow up a train with innocent crewmembers after stealing their cargo*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *IN THE BLACK TRAILER*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *first appearance*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): "morally gray character" *the bitch tells his ex that he's going to destroy everything she loves for leaving him*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *thats abusive*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *hes been gaslighting since like. he was introduced*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *he killed his own leader*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh, but that was M&K!Adam so it doesn't count ðŸ™„
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh yes i forgot. apparently giving backstory in the seasons they actually give substance to characters invalidates any story he got
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Dumb bitch acts as if Miles and Kerry changed his character after Monty died. Money had the whole story planned out which would have included Adam's backstory
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like u dont just start a series without any future plot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Granted, they probably could have taken some creative liberties, but I'm sure Adam being Blake's abusive ex was planned from the beginning ~~just like bees~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): literally adam has indicated being abusive since we met him and like. that first flashback with blake
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wait what season was that flashback where hes with blake and she's saying shes upset with him killing people, and then he says something like i cant believe you dont believe/trust me anymore
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That was the Adam short before V6
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "Sometimes I get scared that you don't believe in me" or something like that
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i swear that happened earlier than that.... what am i thinking of then? 
idk either way like. Literally did the fall of beacon interaction blake and yang  and adam not give  you any  indication to what he was like
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *non abusive exes dont try to destroy everything you loved/cared about bc you left them*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Really liking Gen:Lock so far. Each episode has carried a lot of weight. Characters are clearly defined with hints of significant backstories, and the tech that has been introduced offers a lot of good potential plot hooks.
