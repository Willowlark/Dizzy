Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): dats salems castle
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't think it's quite the same is it?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Not exactly but similar design kinda
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -goes to find better quaility beacon images from vol 1-
Halim (Greg): I'm like 99% sure beacon is meant to look like her castle
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -falls short- >.> ya'll just gonna have to trust me LOL
Halim (Greg): But I'm guessing she still.lives in her castle

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she stuck prob
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/c/c9/Episode2_00005.png/revision/latest?cb=20130902150618
Mark (Mad Doctor): The anti-Beacon?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but yea thats beacon, or what beacon is based off of
Halim (Greg): Well see the schools and everything were built after the huge war remember?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): similar basic shape. could have been modified
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): side note: Yellow brick road 👀
Halim (Greg): But what if she was trying to do something good and he was helping her
But then things went wrong
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Did you mean: Wicked the musical
Halim (Greg): Yes basically
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): No good thing is ever done unpunished
Halim (Greg): ~~look at her, shes wicked. No one mourns the wicked. So we have to bring her down~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I need to watch Wicked...~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theres bootlegs on youtube
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like hwo there is a random valid in my same response XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not the greatest quality but not awful either
Mark (Mad Doctor): Given that the Grimm are associated with negative emotions, I don't think Salem is a misunderstood hero at the time of the series. But something might have caused her to fall from grace
Halim (Greg): 😜
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao Erik lets skip the con and go see wicked instead next weekend XD
Halim (Greg): I dont think shes a misunderstood hero
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): sign me the fuck up too
Halim (Greg): Definitely a fall from grace though
Erik (Red Riot Thot): agreed
Mark (Mad Doctor): I've seen people say "Oh, Ozpin lied? Then maybe Salem's really the good guy." I don't buy that line of thinking
Halim (Greg): The discourse on tumblr is ridiculous
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjQpXrZFWgI
Halim (Greg): You have people who are like "ozpin is the worst of all time"
And then you have the "how dare they invade his privacy"
Halim (Greg): It's just ugly
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Something happened between her and Ozpin to turn her evil
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): deceit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He's obviously hiding some very important information from them that is putting their safety at risk, of course they're going to invade his privacy
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm loving the fact that the answer might be "It's complicated"
Halim (Greg): It's a no brainer
Halim (Greg): Ozpin works the way he does cause hes essentially a very tired and very broken human being trying to carry the responsibility of the world on his shoulders
Marisa (Weeb): i stand behind the shaky ozpin evil brother and salem good brother theory
Marisa (Weeb): oh hey greg
Halim (Greg): It doesnt excuse his lies or secrets but it makes sense why he does it 
Team RWBY is risking there lives for his cause 
So of course if he keeps hiding things their gonna pry
Halim (Greg): Hi Marisa
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ultimately, I believe that all adult authority figures are going to die/succumb to their flaws/drop into the distance, leaving Team RWBY to step into their adult roles
Georgia (Something Sensible): 🙌Death death death! 🙌

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Daenerys = blake maybe?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Arya=Ruby. Young stabby girl
Georgia (Something Sensible): Does that make Yang Sansa?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Salem is the white walker king
Georgia (Something Sensible): She IS white....... and walks....... and makes an army..... wowee
Mark (Mad Doctor): Tyrian sadly is a poor fit to be Tyrion
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tyrian gotta be Qrow

Georgia (Something Sensible): “I drink and I know things” like come on
