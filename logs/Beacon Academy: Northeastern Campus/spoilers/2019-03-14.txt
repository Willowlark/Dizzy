Erik (Red Riot Thot): RWBY Loops are part of a balanced breakfast
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Rwby loops is a fanfic. It‚Äôs over a million words. Reality is broken, all of them, and while it‚Äôs getting fixed the universes loop infinitely. There are variant loops, fused loops, crossover loops, and ruby always remembers a loop but the other loopers skip loops sometimes. 

Boredom is the enemy and you have an infinite amount of time. 

TLDR it‚Äôs a bunch of shorts of the time looping, genre aware characters.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ‚ÄúWhy is Ozpin using a cane your fault Salem?‚Äù

Salem blushed.
