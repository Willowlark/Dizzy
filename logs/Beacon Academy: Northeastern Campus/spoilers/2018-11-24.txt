snow ( karma chameleon ): If salem is a grimmified human, would Ren’s semblance make him invisible to her
Halim (Greg): She can still see tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I AM SATISFIED
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): THIS IS GOOD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): GOOD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): NOT EXPOSITION.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): PEOPLE DISAGREEING.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): BAD THINGS.JPG
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): AND ***OF COURSE***
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ***NEO-MOTHERFUCKING-POLITAN**
Matt (mattmyers25): NEO'S BACK!!!!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): FUNNY LINES.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ***THE FIGHT CHOEREOGRAPHY***
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): sorry Leanna BUT BEES FIGHTING
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also I have thing for anti hero Neo. That’d be fantastic.
Georgia (Something Sensible): deadpool neo when
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And I think Neo needs to be independently powerful. She’s never been shaken before. I figure she’s just as powerful as Cinder.
Georgia (Something Sensible): i didnt see the episode yet but i dont care about spoilers anyways lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She goes where she wants, in the Roman mentality of watching out for herself as number one. But Roman is her weakness, cause he’s the only thing that matters to her.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~backstory when~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh IM EXCITED AND I KNOW ILL BE DISAPPOINTED BUT I DONT CARE.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I would NOT be surprised if they did a “where was Neo” next week. I’m okay with it, even if I REALLY want more of Bee fighting and Weiss’s insecurities showing up.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cause insecure Weiss needs HUGS.
Matt (mattmyers25): Everyone needs hugs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Guys
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm not ok
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That was so gay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also NEO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): NEO MY FUCKONG BAE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ALSO ANGST
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ALSO GAYS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Guys I did a reaction when the bees scene happened
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This image really gets the emotion
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM SOBBING IN THIS CLUB
Jess (whoozica): Dat was good ep
Jess (whoozica): Wuts in the basement owo
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Roman is in the basement
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Neo has such a child like innocence to her
Tom (tomukuncosplay): But isnso powerful
Jess (whoozica): Both yang and weiss said they were tired and I think that's def a red flag and isn't just them making excuses cuz everyone in the town "fell asleep and never woke up"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The sandman is in the basement
Jess (whoozica): Probs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ... ok I said that as a joke but what if...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YEAH childhood innocence.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Neo needs Roman back.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): GIVE ME ROMAN.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): NO BODY
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): CINDER ISNT GOOD ENOUGH FOR NEO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh SHIT Jess.
Jess (whoozica): Sleepy girls
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I admit, I think Weiss complaining and wanted to stop like that is a bit ooc. I hope we do get some of Weiss being insecure, rather than a magic effect. ~~please don’t make all the character development because of a Grimm~~ I’d like to see a Weiss who is afraid of returning to her home, to Jacques and the life she’s trying to be free from.
Jess (whoozica): You can have one (1) sleepy girl
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like if Yang is only pissed cause of a Grimm I’mma bomb RT.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yang is also saying shes tired because of emotional stuff, I dont think it erases their development though. It just might tie into the grimm story next
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah. You know what I mean, the RT can’t write fear.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I want Yang to be mad at Blake. For Ruby and Weiss to meddle (I noticed Blake and Ruby talking which is a like, first in canon), for them to fight and talk and have FEELINGS.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Give me a reason to think bees is the good shit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also, now that I think about it Blake had an explicit scene with Weiss too. Blake and Ruby talked about the photo, Blake brought Weiss a blanket...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): BOY I hope that’s a setup for “I desperately want to make up for leaving but I’m doing it by not talking about it and you guys aren’t having that shit”.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *please give me character arcs*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): GOOD EPISODE
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Maria, standing in the doorway:* "Close the door!"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Maria is a ticking time bomb for an exposition episode. I wish her death.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "I'll find us a story to read before bed" definitely set us up for that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need a screen cap of Oscar facepalming after that, cause that me when RT does exposition.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): 
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Ripe for memes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Bring back Arthur's fist meme 2k19*
Georgia (Something Sensible): my coworker keeps trying to talk to me while i watch the episode on my lunch break
Georgia (Something Sensible): also this dead bodies thing is creepy
Georgia (Something Sensible): rwby taking a turn into creepy territory is interesting
Matt (mattmyers25): It's like aot with what's in the basement
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Resident RWBY.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But like... going off what Leanna said... what if it's actually the boogeyman? Like, not called that obviously, but what if it's some creature that puts them into an eternal sleep and they just... die?
Georgia (Something Sensible): a 14 minute episode compared to a 26 minute episode is so short damn
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Allusion to Wizard of Oz: POPPIES
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@334090409389195266>
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yang: "We can hook up Bumblebee..."
Really, you're just figuring that out, Yang?
Georgia (Something Sensible): what are the popular theories about "brunswick" right now?
Mark (Mad Doctor): They sort of hit us over the head with it.  I was scanning the photo for a familiar character.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But lowkey, does bumblebee have enough horsepower to tow a carriage carrying 4 teenagers, an adult man, and an elderly woman, plus all of their weapons and gear?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Based on Yang's Chibi dream, yes
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): The corpses in the bed were the two adults in the center. No sign of the children.  Either their bodies were discovered off camera, or they are elsewhere, perhaps in the basement
snow ( karma chameleon ): It’s a Freddy Krueger grimm yall
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wonder how long they’re supposed to be corpses
Georgia (Something Sensible): they’re obviously not freshly dead
Georgia (Something Sensible): And it would be hard to wager a guess because the cold could preserve them
Georgia (Something Sensible): _damn no knowledge of forensics can help now_
snow ( karma chameleon ): there’s a Freddy Krueger spirit in Japanese mythos
snow ( karma chameleon ): spreads my mythology hands everywhere
snow ( karma chameleon ): my monies on wendigos
Georgia (Something Sensible): oooo yeah they havent used wendigos yet
Georgia (Something Sensible): _until dawn vibes everywhere_
Georgia (Something Sensible): the only mythology im seeing for brunswick besides the brunswick lion is the brunswick springs which were cursed native american ground
Georgia (Something Sensible): and anyone who tried to use the land for profit would fail
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~fail sometimes interpreted as die~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RWBY campaign needs rising.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So who all as Cinder here wanna throw down at Katsu OwO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YES.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need this.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not... as Cinder... but shooting!
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m just saying there’s spirits in Native American mythology that would make ppl sick in their sleep / in general until they died
snow ( karma chameleon ): then there’s wendigos
Georgia (Something Sensible): _both both both_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): One of these things is not like the others
Georgia (Something Sensible): _one of these things just doesnt belong_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~thank you~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So... I dont think this is the case at all, ots probably going to be a wendigo or some other creature, but while looking for sleep death cryptids I ran across this:
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 4.​ ​Djinn


Also known as Jinn, these spirits are the basis for what the world now knows as genies, although they aren’t quite as friendly as modern day depictions would lead us to believe. Far from Disney’s Aladdin, djinn attacks are blamed for many accounts of sleep paralysis throughout the ages.

They are supposed to enter your room while you’re vulnerable and fast asleep. They then hold you still as they slowly strangle you to death. Djinns are supposed to be scared off if they hear prayers to ALLAH or any reading from the QURAN, meaning you should brush up if you wish to protect yourself.
It is also said that some djinn will attack while wearing a hat. This is supposed to be something that is worth looking out for because lore states that if you are able to successfully survive an attack and also steal their hat, the spirit will be forced to be your slave for the remainder of your lifetime.

We think that’s a nice perk, but wouldn’t be up for the whole strangling thing in the first place, which just seems a little unnecessary. This being said, some djinn aren’t evil at all, with them being a lot like people and free to make their own decisions and follow their own paths. Some are good, with others being indifferent to humans, with a little something for everyone, depending on what particular spirit you happen to encounter.
The djinn date back to ancient Arabia, being passed down to Muslim and Islamic faiths today, hence needing to pray to Allah or read from the Koran to fend off their malicious midnight choking sprees. Djinn are even alluded to in some Jewish sects and they also show up in certain translations of the Old Testament in place of ‘familiar spirit’ in Leviticus, Samuel, and Chronicles chapters.
These days we know djinn as genie, who are mostly good, but can be twisted to evil. Unlike their ancientcounterparts, genies give wishes while the real deal is a little less willing to use their powers, especially at someone else’s behe
Georgia (Something Sensible): _midnight choking spree_
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m kinkshaming
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~they would all thank her tbh~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): _someone elses behe_
Georgia (Something Sensible): **Behe**
snow ( karma chameleon ): Yang and Weiss seem most affected
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m ready for ruby and Blake to speak more words to each other and save the day
Mark (Mad Doctor): Another point this week: looks like they intend to make Qrow's alcohol abuse a lot less funny. The demons that attack him in the title sequence may not be Grimm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s a fun topic tho.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *give me the good drama*
Mark (Mad Doctor): We need Weiss to organize an intervention. She's seen the dark side of alcoholism
Georgia (Something Sensible): why doesnt mark write rwby gdamn
Georgia (Something Sensible): this is some compelling plot that hes proposing
Matt (mattmyers25): He can write fan fiction. An alternative universe
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m glad qrow’s alcoholism isn’t being laughed off anymore. It’s actually really sad that ruby, a child, is sorta taking care of him in that aspect
Matt (mattmyers25): I feel that on  a person level what she is doing. I have had to do that with my dad
Matt (mattmyers25): That scene hit home for me
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah, for all the creepiness of the episode, the moment when Ruby says "We can't let Qrow find this place" was downright chilling.

I'd add Oscar to the list. "Fuck you, Ozpin! I'm going to kill you with whiskey!"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Same I’m super happy they are takin his alcoholism seriously
Mark (Mad Doctor): Might add depth to the Snowbirds arc if they ever follow up: Winter realizes she has feelings for Qrow but is afraid of getting too close because of her mother's issues
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Changes himself for love. That’d be something.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~assuming snowbirds will ever get an arc~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~I think hes gonna die~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~but it would be nice to see more winter interactions~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~please hold off on qrow death until atlas, thx~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): He and momma Schnee dry out, fall for each other and get married. Ruby is thrilled at having Weiss as a sister (-ish). Meanwhile <@229713389511901185> cries to the heavens as her ship sinks...
snow ( karma chameleon ): After this episode, someone from last year’s Katsucon messaged me and told me they were sorry for forcing their help on me / controlling my wheelchair when I said not to bc of the blake and yang scene. rt did some good there, that hit home for me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Wow, that's really great actually
snow ( karma chameleon ): it made me SOB like I’m so happy??? Not that I don’t think yang should ask for help sometimes, it’s important to be able to do, but wow it was v realistically done
