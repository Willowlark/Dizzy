Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): tTHERE SHOULD BE A GENLOCK LOGO ON THE ATLASZOID
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also Blake should take Adams weapon and use that instead of gambol shroud.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No, that weapon has done horrible things
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's like Harry Potter using Voldemort's wand
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Use it to kill him with
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just want him to get yeeted off a cliff like the character he's based off of
Mark (Mad Doctor): Blake has blown Adam off once, telling him he's not really part of her world anymore. I kind of want to see that happen again, but have it sink in. Don't kill him, but make him realize what a pathetic shit he has become
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Mm.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Heâ€™ll really suffer knowing Blake has replaced him entirely with Yang.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Clarity: one of the worst things you can wish on a villain
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "hey whats your sexuality?"
