Marisa (Weeb): the new Lets Go game has a totally new system.
wild pokemon aren't hiding in grass, you can see them wandering around and can approach them (or sometimes they'll run into you). then you don't fight them, you can only catch them a la Pokemon Go with pokeballs and berries.

it's only the first gen pokemon, it's basically the original red/blue/yellow all over again but you can carry over pokemon from Go. I don't think you can evolve your eevee or pikachu.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): neat
Marisa (Weeb): pokemon centers and pokemarts are separate again (they've been combined the last few game iterations), and the box where you store extra pokemon is in your pocket so you can basically swap your party at any time
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ah gotcha
Marisa (Weeb): all pokemon also share exp oh frick a zubat just flew into me
Marisa (Weeb): you can also see CP like in pokemon go
Marisa (Weeb): sun and moon were cool i liked team skull
Marisa (Weeb): they weren't evil they were just bored kids
Marisa (Weeb): a giant clefable just spawned and started rushing at me at the NPCs i was next to it was terrifying
