Georgia (Something Sensible): ‚ÄúI hope RT has vision coverage cause all these employees wear glasses‚Äù -Jess
Erik (slendergiant): VERY EXCITED FOR THIS SEASON
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good 1st episode!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WHY DO THEY HATE MY TEAM
Matt (mattmyers25): Agreed
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Jnpr you will be missed
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): HI LETS GIVE JAUNE A NEW SEMBLANCE
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): THEN YEER HIM SOMEWHERE FAR FAR AWAY
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): *SCREAMING IN BEE*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Jaune and Ren get a spin-off series that is a buddy road trip. They have zany adventures and lots of awkwardness
Mark (Mad Doctor): And hell yes to the bees. The door seems wide open
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cosplans: Qrow with martini glass. I love when my favorite things come together
Erik (slendergiant): And they put a close on the Black Sun ship. This is the dawning of the Age of the Bee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I told <@!155492347122155520> he needs to do Qrow's weapon in scythe form now so him and Snow (not @-ing her cause hasn't seen yet) can get some dope shots together sometime and maybe recreate  that scene? OwO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also funny convo of taking on task of making said scythe for him
*Matt: Who's gonna make it?
Me: Umm me bishh! I love making props and have done them for ya before. I'm making a scythe here soon for Shinoa~
Matt: Okay make yours first though..*
lmfao okay... make mine first so yours can be better yea since better skilled? üòù Teehee
Jess (whoozica): well of course! lol
Matt (mattmyers25): XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm loving how Weiss and Ruby clearly ship Bumblebee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Weiss and Ruby: bumblebee shippers 
Neptune: Black sun shipper 
üòÇ
Jess (whoozica): I really liked the first episode! more than i expected too I like the new environments and stuff and I liked the fight scenes. I dont think JNR is gone either, they'll either meet up with them or switch back and forth I think (i hope)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...i ..can't believe they ACTUALLY made sun AND ilia go away so that its bee focused...i CANT BEELIEVE IT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): plus the obvious trend of adam being relevent again this season
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im READY FOR MY BEES
Matt (mattmyers25): Adam is kylo
Matt (mattmyers25): Kylo ren
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i havent seen the star war but from what i know about kylo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Matt (mattmyers25): Blake could be rey
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üëÄ don't tempt me with these crossovers Matt lol.
Kinda sad sun and ilia are going away (probs for just a while?) cause I really like their characters üò´ lol. 
And yea I hope JNR doesn't vanish either and meets back up. >.<
Rebecca (madameterralupus): But this season so far looks promising. I really enjoyed the new episode!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also... that tease of Neptune üò´ they finally bring him back and he's gone again... nooo
Erik (slendergiant): The Neptune cameo was definitely fan service, but very much appreciated fan service
Mark (Mad Doctor): More fuel for Sea Monkey shippers
I was pleased with how they sent off Ilia. I was sure she was going to be there Unrequited Lesbian who does in Atlas to show how badly SchneeCorp treats faunus.
Erik (slendergiant): Also loved they gave her a new outfit
Erik (slendergiant): *still no new outfit for Sun though*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey has cosplans
Erik (slendergiant): Sun's character really developed in that one scene. He served his purpose of helping Blake find her purpose and bringing her back to her team. He puts aside his own personal feelings for her to let her go her path while realizing that he needs to focus on his team as well. Would love to see full Team SSSN back in action in the future (even if not this season, but I think it leaves potential for future seasons)
Erik (slendergiant): It would be really neat if the final battle against Salem (or maybe some other evil) that they bring back all the teams again to fight similar to the end of Vol 3
Erik (slendergiant): That season's poster would be Infinity War-esque with like two dozen people on it
Erik (slendergiant): ~~fuck now I want to draw that~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm indeed. He did really develop and it was such a cute touching scene. üò≠
Also yesss that's what i was thinking. It's would deff be super cool if like *everyone* reunited to take down Salem. 
~~do it. Draw it~~
Erik (slendergiant): Ugh I hate getting those creative bursts at work because now I don't want to do anything but that xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üòÇ a mood. It happens to me too. And it's even worse for me cause I work at a craft store so I'm like shit the stuff is *right here*
Mark (Mad Doctor): On the ride home, Audrey and I realized how much cooler the train scene would have been if they had used Team CRDL as the train guards rather than Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Erik and I were talking on the way home about how over reacted the one guy getting hurt was. Like we were expecting his arm to be gone and it was just a scratch/bruise üòÇ Like... wat
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok, HOW wasnt his arm ripped off
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right?!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he fucking SLAMMED into that wall on a train going REAL FAST
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he fucking SLAMMED into that wall on a train going REAL FAST
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how did he get off with only a bruise/broken arm
Jess (whoozica): YEA wtf
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Exactly. Like it deff would have done something worse than a bruise/scratch XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like okay maybe they didn't want to be so violent... but at the same time they had Adam fucking slaughter a bunch of people sooo
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ok, now I want Jaune to start puking at the sight of blood. "Quick, Jaune! Use your semblance! But point the other way, Vomit Boy"
Mark (Mad Doctor): The Adam scene was pretty intense. I liked it, but one of Audrey's friends brought his eight year old brother.
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH THE TRAIN THING WAS LIKE WTF
Georgia (Something Sensible): a mood
Erik (slendergiant): **How the train scene should have ended:**
> Dumbass screaming in pain with a missing arm
> Ren applying pressure to control the bleeding while Jaune amplifies his aura to close the wound
> Qrow reaming him out afterwards for being a dumbass
> Yang saying something along the lines of "Big mood, but you get used to it"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BIG MOOD
Erik (slendergiant): **Me last night:**
~BMBLBY team attack on the train~ *"Wow, I bet <@!334090409389195266> is pissing her pants right now..."*
~Ren daydreaming of himself on the beach~ *"Wow, I bet <@!351471675843411978> is pissing her pants right now"*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you were absolutely correct
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i LEFT MY SEAT SPAZZING OUT
Georgia (Something Sensible): THEY REPLAYED THE SUNFLOWER SCENE and we were like "oh look its erik!"
Erik (slendergiant): I was cheering
Jess (whoozica): YES  YOU WERE CORRECT
Mark (Mad Doctor): For a second, I thought they were going to start vol 6 by continuing the sunflower scene. Mild disappointment
Jess (whoozica): i literaly bounced in the seat Georgia can confirm
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Daydream Ren: Tom's new cosplay? lol
Jess (whoozica): *did you mean: CCE Ren*
Jess (whoozica): when is a spoiler not a spoiler anymore? cuz i could def make an edit recreating of that scene for insta XD
Erik (slendergiant): you could always add a spoiler warning photo before it in the same post? Or just make the caption really ambiguous?
Erik (slendergiant): although, that scene was in that two minute sneak peak that probably mostly everybody has watched already
Mark (Mad Doctor): Two weeks is a fair wait. But with the warning panel as Erik suggested, no need to worry
Jess (whoozica): OOO ok i didnt watch sneaky peak
Jess (whoozica): okey dokey!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I didn't either. I wanted to be surprised when I saw it yesterday lol
Jess (whoozica): i mean its not a HUGE spoiler, its like baby fanserive spoiler but still i dont like to ruin peopls funnies
Jess (whoozica): *stats combing through pics of tom at cce*
Jess (whoozica): I walked into work and RWBY soundtrack was playing (cuz the guys down there listen to it sometimes) and i was gonna ask if they saw it lasst night, but then i remembered that they didn't know who Ren and Nora were when i told them we cosplayed them so i just kept walking lmao
Georgia (Something Sensible): LOL
Jess (whoozica): the one guy thought ren was ozpin and i was like O.O
Marisa (Weeb): is anyone caught up on BNHA
the first page of the new chapter has me dying
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ooo i will be in a minute
Marisa (Weeb): hilarious
Marisa (Weeb): "shouto why won't you respond"
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): omg I love it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): also I love Iida
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): "Stuck? PLEASE"
Marisa (Weeb): i have a bad feeling about rotating limb boy. lots of bad fanfics about him.
