Erik (Red Riot Thot): *My Star Wars nerd ass rewatching 6x11: "If only the ship they stole had harpoons and tow cables..."*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I'm just thinking how proud Taiyang would be of Yang's fighting
Erik (Red Riot Thot): **PROUD DAD**
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah she used a lot more kicks and misdirection in her fight.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also never once used her semblance
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She hasn’t gotten beaten up enough yet maybe?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They emphasized that by lowering her arm from her face, revealing her eyes not red
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Shes building her power but what gets me and makes me emo is that she hits adam 10 times before blake tells her about his semblance but after she tells her she only hits him once
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But allows him to his her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Hit*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Tai's whole training was to rely less on her semblance and more about fighting smarter
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And when it's absolutely time to unleash the dragon...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Adam is fuuuuuuuuuuuuucked
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Go Yang
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I love her 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm gonna freak out next episode again
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Catch a bitch crying
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s quality fighting too, that’s another perk.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao so much bee stuff is happening recently Leanna's gonna end up dying from excitement before the finally XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Shame Adam going to die, he’s the only villain who can duel right now~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Idk if I'll make it to katsu I might die before
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, Cinder and Neo... mainly Neo.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Neo will have to step up as a combatant.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need to art a picture of Yang taking a selfie holding up Adam's unconscious body while Blake kisses her cheek and sending it to Tai
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fill the cool boss battle void.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg Erik please XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Omg rebecca if you ever do genderbend adam
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Can we recreate it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): YES
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Bdhdhhdhd YES GOOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAOOOOOO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also bish know if we ever find a regular Adam I am game to do it non genderbent with ya too XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YES YES YES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🐝 👌
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Addition to that art idea: Tai not noticing Adam at first and thinking Yang was just sending a pic of her and her new girlfriend
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "Thanks for the training dad!"
"See! I told you those pickup lines would work!"
"No... dad... look..."
"OH SHIT YOU GOT THAT BITCH BOY! ATTA GIRL YANG! PROUD OF YOU!"
Matt (mattmyers25): This should be recreated in a photo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Best dad
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂 Got that bitch boy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes this needs to be recreated omg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm down
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Although Adam definitely gonna fall off the cliff a la Beauty and the Beast
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 100%
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): No doubt
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Please
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yang: "Long live the B E E S"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *yeets Adam off the cliff*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "Did you honestly think a HUMAN could love YOU blake?"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Someone asked that on last week's rwbyrw and I know we talked about him causing his own demise like Gaston but then it clicked when I remembered Blake and Yang and Beauty and the Beast
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeeeee
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): They are doing the end of the movie fight scene pretty accurately
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He's going to be hanging off the side, trying to get back up, a small branch makes its way into the trigger of his weapon, Blake sees it and tries to warn him, Adam shifts position causing his weapon to fire, launching him down the side to his death
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Bye bitch
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also I love how they keep talking about how Yang *should* hit Adam with the bike
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://bmblbs.tumblr.com/post/182019131798/maya-of-lesbos-rwby-rewind-preview-spoilers-for
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Preview for next week
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ruby is still a badass
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm thankful
Rebecca (madameterralupus): > Me: Okay cool fighting the giant mech, I know this is part of the main mission in the story but ehhh gimme the bees fighting Adam more as a preview clip XDD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Not really sure where else to put this but I know Kurtis is still catching up sooooo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nEdZ_Sak
Erik (Red Riot Thot): haven't finished watching it but I love fan-rewrites
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~because they can be better than the original~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): already love her idea for a Raven short
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): http://moonsandstar-s.tumblr.com/post/182032410864/tt-vision-my-alternative-take-on-chapter-11
Matt (mattmyers25): Did you notice on the radar screen in the preview for the next episode there is a red dot. Something is coming
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i didnt but now i need to rewatch~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i was too focused on trying to figure out if the tiny guard is neo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): can't tell
Matt (mattmyers25): I'm think a new grimm is coming
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): probably a deep sea grimm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that they mentioned last ep
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so uh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what if
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Anna (Cadmium): KRAKEN
Anna (Cadmium): PLS LET IT BE KRAKEN GRIMM
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ALSO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because im bee trash
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): looks familiar
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): waterfall
Erik (Red Riot Thot): someone theorized a godzilla-esque grimm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~but they foreshadowed deep sea grimm last episode~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): doesn't godzilla emerge from the deep sea?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): does it?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i thought godzilla was like a big dino
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he is but he's technically a sea monster
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): guess we'll see
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): my bets are on a kraken
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but godzilla would be lit too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel that godzilla would make more sense because then it poses a threat on Argus, but since it's so close to the end of the season, I don't think it would make sense to have a giant Grimm battle that doesn't drive the plot...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but then again, it *is* Rooster Teeth so who fucking knows
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like part of me wants them to just /not/
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and instead have cinder/neo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which have been a part of this season
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but with so few episodes left im losing hope in that idea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it might very well end up being a giant grimm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which, like you said, i dont see how that will help the plot?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): OR WHAT IF THE RED DOT IS ANOTHER HIJACKED ATLAS SHIP WITH CINDER AND NEO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): BADASS AERIAL BATTLE THAT ACTUALLY DRIVES THE PLOT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): please
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): please @roosterteeth
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I mean Neo was there on the airfield... she very easily could have jacked one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I really think if they want to progress this plot more, they need to make episode duration consistent and about 22-23 minutes like a normal show. They've been doing a lot of shorter episodes and I think that is affecting plot progression
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): definitely
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont understand why they do that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I doubt we'll get more than a teaser for Neo/CInder. They aren't the finale to the arc, ~~the robot chick and~~ Adam is.
Anna (Cadmium): ~~please let winter show up~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There were only 3 episodes that were at least 20 minutes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yeah, but remember where they started with episodes shorter than the opening.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If every episode was 22 minutes long, there would have been 57 more minutes of content this season
Anna (Cadmium): i think that they cut them shorter to not cut dialogue n shit off and scenes short but like. if they stayed a consistent length now it would be beneficial
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh shit year have to fast forward 2 minutes every episode past GenLock teaser and Opening
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea... get genlock the FUCK out of the rwby opening
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): stop oversaturating it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Preach
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its making me not want to watch
Erik (Red Riot Thot): like the more they shamelessly plug it, the less I even want to watch it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, imagine if the barn scene with the bees actually had time to continue.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea...an ACTUAL talk
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Matt (mattmyers25): How are their other shows?
Anna (Cadmium): like. we get it. we get genlock. im fine with it there but likeeeeee dont take time out of the ep
Matt (mattmyers25): How long
Anna (Cadmium): uhhhhhhhh camp camp isnt short what are they like 10 mins?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): something like that
Anna (Cadmium): i lied 10-15 mins and a few specials are 20
Anna (Cadmium): never watched nomad of nowhere, RVB is an outlier that shouldnt be counted
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I tried Nomad. Couldn't get into it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I love Nomad.
I need to keep watching RVB
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm on season 6
Georgia (Something Sensible): i watched RVB years ago and i sorta fell off when stuff got too convoluted
Georgia (Something Sensible): i liked it when it was just the reds and the blues doing shenanigans but then they added the freelancers and i was like whaaa
Erik (Red Riot Thot): RVB was great but after season 10 I was losing interest
Anna (Cadmium): i tried watching RVB but its honestly so much to watch rn its impossible
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Which, not surprisingly is when Miles started directing, soooo...
Matt (mattmyers25): So rwby is about the same length as others
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but it's currently their top grossing show, with the most plot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it should have a consistent episode length by now
Georgia (Something Sensible): if episodes were longer, there would be more content, and then people would be less critical of what happened during the episode
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats why people were critical of V4, cause nothing really "happened"
Anna (Cadmium): like. keep it consistent and like ok if it varies a minute or two in either direction in order to end where you want, thats fine
Anna (Cadmium): but like 20 mins +/- 2 should be what they aim for now
Anna (Cadmium): if they have to apologize and say hey this ep is short we had problems like. okay, but make it up
Anna (Cadmium): i dont remember season 4
Anna (Cadmium): what happened in season 4
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *nothing*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): everyone moped around
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and then the end they were like "that was dumb lets start doing things in vol 5"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the end
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Blake and Sun defeated a big sea monster
RNJR defeated the nuckaleve(sp)
Yang trained with Tai
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Vol 4 in a nutshell
Anna (Cadmium): oh  yes now i remember why i dont remember it.
the only character i cosplayed had nearly no screen time and no one was attempting to fix her abandonment issues or ptsd
Anna (Cadmium): to be fair the sea monster fight was cool
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~was it~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The major goal of Vol 6 is for them to get to Atlas, and if they don't get there by the end (which, with two episodes left, isn't looking great) I will be a little disappointed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i only remember the lack of physics in that scene~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~also everyone was like fucking no what are these costumes and spent all their time on that instead~~
Anna (Cadmium): physics was lacking. cool wyvern was cool. also sun being caught bridal style and then dropped
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mood
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): sun being dropped is my aesthetic
Anna (Cadmium): ~~the sun at ANYC got dropped during the photoshoot~~
Anna (Cadmium): i felt so bad for him
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Anna (Cadmium): he was cool with it tho
Anna (Cadmium): oh wait. i spent all of season 4 tryna get mag to just cave and wear heels for blake
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL did she?
Anna (Cadmium): yes.
Anna (Cadmium): and it was pain
Anna (Cadmium): we then had a rule that only one of us could wear ridiculous shoes each day at a con
Mark (Mad Doctor): Vol. 4 highlight: canon Renora. And look how fast that relationship has moved. Nora saying "Stay away from my man" was one of the first real signs that they are a couple. Not that I'm complaining. In fact, I'm glad things are unfolding at a natural pace. But I expect the same pacing for Bumbleby
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hold hands == couple
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ That comment makes me think of Zenkaikon and how we were joking about that lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): they gotta do the wiggle
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh, red dot definitely not  Neo. It's coming from way offshore so definitely a giant sea grimm
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Can't wait for a lackluster finale
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://tenor.com/view/fake-fakexcitement-congratulations-gif-5970105
Mark (Mad Doctor): Atlas is way offshore. Submarine with Winter and Ironwood, telling Murder Hobbit to stand down. I hope
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ooh that would be good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MURDER HOBIT
Mark (Mad Doctor): Could also apply to Maria tbh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The Murder Hobbits XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'd watch that series
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe):
