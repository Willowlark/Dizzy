Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yo, do we wanna actually do a poll to add a marvel spoilers channel because i know a lot of us are seeing it tomorrow night
Erik (Red Riot Thot): We could always just specify End Game spoilers and then use the spoiler feature? Would probably get annoying after a while though lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good idea. Im going to want to geek out over it all week, and I don't want to spoil anyone's fun. Could we not use the current spoilers channel though, on the assumption that people will be discussing Endgame there for the next week or so
Erik (Red Riot Thot): like:
**ENG GAME SPOILER**
||Ant-Man crawled up Thanos's ass and expanded||
Mark (Mad Doctor): Shit. Shouldn't have clicked that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): god dAmn it erik
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but yea i feel like that would be really annoying to talk in blacked out boxes in here
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we can always have a temporary marvel spoiler channel
Jess (whoozica): temp channel is a good idea i think!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A temp spoiler channel would be nice. I am in the works on making plans to see it but idk how soon I'll be able to...
Mark (Mad Doctor): My nerd club hosted an Endgame deadpool.  Predict who is alive and who is dead at the end.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mark can you repost that in the endgame spoilers channel for anyone who wants to do it ðŸ˜® i kinda want to
