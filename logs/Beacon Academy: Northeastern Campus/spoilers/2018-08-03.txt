Georgia (Something Sensible): They played a short of Adam with his backstory a bit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oooh, 10 bucks he's being put on a bus in the new season.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Only an Adam short, no others
Georgia (Something Sensible): They said they wanna focus on the main volume 6
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 🤔
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > First episode of Volume 6
> Qrow voiceover: "I think it's time I told you something kids."
> *World of Remnant appears on screen*
Georgia (Something Sensible): Volume 6 concept art stuff for announcements
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yang has the same outfit, cute art
Georgia (Something Sensible): They've already written up to chapter 13 of volume 6
Georgia (Something Sensible): Now they're doing Q&A and the lines are way long
Georgia (Something Sensible): The first two questions were kinda lame
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oof, and 17 people are going to ask stupid questions like "is bumblebee canon", "is Qrow Ruby's Dad", "will Vic give me a hug".
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone said "can I give you something" and someone asked "can you clarify copyright"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Can you clarify copyright*
Matt (mattmyers25): Ummmm
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone asked "how hard has it been to continue RWBY without Monty" and Barbara basically said those questions are uncomfortable
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Expect uninsightful questions, ones that the team will obviously not answer, or random crap.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Miles said it's always been difficult but they learned a lot from Monty
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *thats* an interesting answer. Barbara's.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wanted to ask if hunters/huntresses only get one weapon for life, but the lines so long I'm not gonna get to ask it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lore wise it would make sense they constantly upgrade their weapon. It's an expression of individuality.
Georgia (Something Sensible): "What would happen if each of the characters you play got the infinity gauntlet"
Georgia (Something Sensible): BARABARA SAID "RUBY I DONT FEEL SO GOOD"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Miles "jaune would screw it up so bad"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone asked "how do you edit an episodic script"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Answer is kinda boring
Georgia (Something Sensible): I want lore questions 😭😭😭😭
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Never expect good questions.
Georgia (Something Sensible): "For writing and voice acting, what's been the most surprising thing for your characters when you're first reading the script or the idea first came to you?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Lindsey said trying to approach Ruby's emotional baggage
Georgia (Something Sensible): Kara and Barbara sound so much like Weiss and Yang lmao
Georgia (Something Sensible): "Something that shocked me is happening in volume 6" -Miles
Matt (mattmyers25): That's what I thought when I saw Barbara last year at RTX london
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Miles: Trolololo, lolol
Georgia (Something Sensible): "Over the course of these almost six years. What is the most that has changed about you as a person?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Lindsay was like "I had a baby"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): snarky, I like it.
Georgia (Something Sensible): "What's your fav/least fav parts of making a season or episode of RWBY"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Waiting is their least fav lol
Tom (tomukuncosplay): That would be a good question to ask
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Maybe ren could get some new fucking guns
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Maybe a rocket.launcher
Jess (whoozica): Lul wut
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye noooo
Matt (mattmyers25): Too op
Georgia (Something Sensible): Low key frustrated that people didn't really ask intriguing questions
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like the copyright guy?
Georgia (Something Sensible): That's so fucking dumb
Tom (tomukuncosplay): yeah thats pretty fucking dumb lmao
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s usually how it goes.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): ya know those teachers that say theres no such thing as a dumb question, whelp
Tom (tomukuncosplay): we foundit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Only VA panel worth a damn was the 12 of us with Elizabeth Maxwell at CCE.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cause it was really relaxed and personal.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (Since everyone else was off trying to worship Vic)
Matt (mattmyers25): I remember having a convo with Bryce papenbrook for like 25 mins at a small con. That was really interesting and fun
