Mark (Mad Doctor): If Ruby's second question is "What's up with my eyes?" all hell will break loose
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Second Question: "How much milk do I need to drink to get big old bittes like yours?"

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): !lewd
Mark (Mad Doctor): "I've got lots of friends! I drank milk!"
Matt (mattmyers25): She must need a lot of cookies for that milk
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That'd be great for a scenes from a hat thing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Excuse me while I setup an entire series of whose line games that are rwby themed.
Mark (Mad Doctor): OMG, what if the vol 1 line about milk was Ruby repeating what she heard Qrow say about booze, not really understanding.
And <@184437198865563648> I'd be down for RWBY improv
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Be a good panel, I've run whose line things before...
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Things not to say to Team JNPR members"
Matt (mattmyers25): What's everyone doing to Valentine's day?
Matt (mattmyers25): In response to mark
Mark (Mad Doctor): Understood, and Katsucon
Matt (mattmyers25): Katsu panels I think have closed to submittions
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd probably want Zenkai or Anext maybe...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I'd have to feel confident in the setup.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Need a good collection of prompts.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): for a variety of games.
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Other uses for character props"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Yang: *Buzzing sounds*
Georgia (Something Sensible): PYRRHA DIED ON VALENTINES DAY U MEANIES
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So I guess you'll be in*dust*posed then.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *technically* she died the day before
Mark (Mad Doctor): <@245270932602486784> really? Because if that shit went down on Katsu weekend, I can only imagine the tears
Georgia (Something Sensible): I literally was at Katsu like “wow next year I’m gonna cosplay Pyrrha!”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And then my whole room watched the episode, most of us still in RWBY cosplay
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I sat there in Yang and watched my girl get 🎵 shot through the heart 🎵
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, I need to now finally get my own First subscription because my friend (that I've been using his account) forgot to update his billing zip code when he moved into his apartment and his subscription ended and he lost his grandfathered price
