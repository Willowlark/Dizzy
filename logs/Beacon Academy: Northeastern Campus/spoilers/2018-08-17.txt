Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): adam short was released early
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): for anyone who wants to watch it before its out on RT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): someone said they showed his face?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=cb4Sh032Z1I
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): spoiler alert: he doesnt
Georgia (Something Sensible): He takes off his mask
Georgia (Something Sensible): But doesn't show his fave
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but the fighting is SO much better than the past 2 volumes
Georgia (Something Sensible): YE
Erik (slendergiant): Also CLEAR EVIDENCE of manipulative emotional abuse
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ THANK GOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because im tired of having to fight about that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm literally rewatching before I say *Why did none of you RTX'ers mention this? I could have spent the last month being excited rather than salty* to the fighting.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ;3c surprise!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You may like the salt but it's not good in prolonged doses kid.
Erik (slendergiant): I said you see him while he's not wearing his mask
Erik (slendergiant): I wasn't wrong
Erik (slendergiant): 😉
Georgia (Something Sensible): 😏
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *deletes Otakon photos*
Georgia (Something Sensible): 😭🙏
Jess (whoozica): ~~excuse i need those~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's not the same pace as monty, but each attack is choreographed well. Adam has a simpler fighting style yes, but they make use of the uniqueness of Wilt(?) when he fires the blade via the shotgun sheath.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah that shits nuts
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There were few cut away scenes to hide the hits and transitions between attacks.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): still, much MUCH better than all of vol 4 and 5
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): few is a good thing, both of those are praise.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nor are they clipping movements, each swing is animated again.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 🙌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Illa is kinda a crap shoot, but she's a minor character in the short. Sienna Khan has a spinny weapon so it's hard to do the frame by frames, but she feels good and *fast*, which is the other way to make the combat complete.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): also, RIP Sienna Khan, the best character to get 5 minutes of screen time. (And for the record, Pilot boi got more than 5.)
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I had to check the name spelling, *thats* the first autocomplete?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Are you honestly surprised
Erik (slendergiant): *"It's time I got what I deserved..."*
Erik (slendergiant): *[a royal ass kicking]*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): THAT WAS GOLD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also ditto to Erik, now I pray RT goes into their past relationship with Blake and present Adam because that'll be *hella* character development and really create a chance for Blake to evolve. It will *also* give us a villain with more than the hunt for the ~~dragon balls~~ relics to hate him for.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Make me HATE Adam. Please*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~but also don't kill him off too quick because of it cause his fighting style is baller~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though beyond confirming what the relationship with Blake was like, I don't feel like I understand him any better. He angry boi, he murder, rinse and repeat.
Jess (whoozica): gotta watch when i get home
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Me: wants to go rewatch Volume 6 cause hype
Also Me: Knows V6 will kill that hype
