Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): SHOTS. FIRED.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh SHIT.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Little Miss *Malchete*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The Malchete twins.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wizard of Oz you say...Isn't Leanna's theory for the show based on that??
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm literally talking to my friend right now about it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But its just being proven correct with each episode
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ozpin has always been the Wizard. There’s the witch Glynda, the lion Lionheart, Tinman ironwood and scarecrow is... I can’t recall.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Qrow
Matt (mattmyers25): Doea this mean Salem hates water?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): There is the story of the Shallow Sea that we have yet to hear
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Also <@!334090409389195266>  whats your theory OwO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Had to share at least one of the reddit comments about thicc genie.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Lesbianest tho, she's hot
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I wanna cosplay her
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Monica cosplays only super powerful women of RWBY.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Monica: Gets a body paintless salem to cosplay if she wants
RWBY: OK But blue Jhinn
Monica: HELLO BODYPAINT
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 😂😂 its true tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!334090409389195266>drop yo theory link in here again lol. I saw Hal asked about it and I know I want to read it cause I keep forgetting to/can never find it XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I need to update it and add like a fuckload of more info to it. But here one sec
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): http://lipstickgiraffe.tumblr.com/post/174661254477/the-wonderful-wizard-of-remnant
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This is just the first part of the theory, I never got around to adding the rest or anything xD but basically they're proving over and over to be pulling storylines directly from various wizard of oz stories that already exist, but mashing them up.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This past episode proved my theory of oscar being the wizards curtain (not dorothy, as most similar theories state). Oscar is pulling back the curtain to reveal the liar behind it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You should spend some time on the wild mass guessing page of tvtropes.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ehhh I'm like too confident in my own theory...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That If I start looking at other peoples stuff I start just 
.. correcting them LMAO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean put your theory up.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I ain’t saying you wrong Lee.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just realized if we call you Lee your name would rhyme with Bee.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I have to flesh out a full theory write up before I really post it anywhere
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): How has anyone not noticed that.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): One of my friends used to call me leebee
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Before rwby existed
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm watching RWBY rewind and Ellie is one of the new co-hosts and she's super pro-Bumbleby
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Bless ellie
Mark (Mad Doctor): I buy the Wizard of Oz theory one hundred percent.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Thank you, I promise it makes even more sense than what is in that post xD I just got lazy and stopped typing it out. I will fix it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also, I'm currently in bee hell right now .. can I just SCREAM for a second???? 
Yang REALLY called for blake with absolute fear in her eyes and in her tone of voice
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yang who literally spent al of vol 5 looking for RUBY who just got reunited with a girl who she refused to say her name for 2 whole volumes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): She really just screamed blake
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): She really did that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Wow. What a time to bee alive

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): excellent.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Status charts are piped.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Unsure what chat to put this in so here works I guess lol. Was looking up some stuff on RWBY characters... and this was in Neptune's section 😂 
"His appearance and outfit is styled after Big Bang member T.O.P. "... Bless 🙌 ❤
Jess (whoozica): OMG
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Makes me love him even more now XD
Jess (whoozica): https://data.whicdn.com/images/66449568/large.jpg
Jess (whoozica): yup thats neptune
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 100% XD
Jess (whoozica): ~~sudden interest in neptune~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Mhmmm girl, right?!~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also Qrow and Raven allude from Huginn and Munnin from Norse Mythology apparently. It says this about them "are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring information to the god Odin" 
Interesting. A lot of stuff has been updated on the characters since I last looked it up lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Scarlet's design was also based on Big Bang
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Jess (whoozica): 😮
Jess (whoozica): Learn something everyday
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh yess I love scarlet more now.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao someone cosplay Neptune or Scarlet with me in Big Bangs actual outfits  now😂
Mark (Mad Doctor): KPop AU shoot?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thinking about Qrow getting snagged by Grimm in the opening credits. He's drinking from his fladk at the time. What if the scene is a metaphor for his increasingly unfunny alcoholism?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Given that the trip to Atlas is likely going to bring Weiss' mother into the story, having a comic drunk around would seriously undercut the drama
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh, so idk if any of you know, but Colleen, the voice actor for Jhinn, was at thy geekdom
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i asked her some questions. apparently shes only had one recording session so far, and doesn't know when the next one is. So we might only be seeing jhinn once this season. 
But, she did hint that "they do have one more questio, right?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Noice! I'm glad you remembered to ask her and pick her brain for more info lol. 🙌🏻
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shes SUPER excited to be doing rwby
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she said that she'd been dying to VA for them since Vol 1
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good! I love so many characters she voices so I to and excited she's doing RWBY :p
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which is super adorable
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So... can we talk about how salem warned us in episode one of rwby that victory comes from honesty not lies. Implying that someone (ozpin) lied to her and hurt her... and then continued her speech the end of volume 3 explaining why shes out to destroy him. And it's all coming together now in the genies story... I think we should give more credit to the writers of this show than we have been because damn...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fuckkkkk
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also salem is definitely related to glynda
Matt (mattmyers25): Sisters?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): probably sisters but could just be cousins or some shit. BUT my bets on sisters
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they look exactly alike
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): only difference is eye color
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the emblem in the mirror
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in salems shot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is very similar to glyndas crown crest
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Shit probably right.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The good witch and the wicked witch.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): glinda and elphaba
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m still not excited about collecting all the lamps from the home good vaults, and this genie stuff seems out of the lore for me (too much straight magic) but I’m running with it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If they can get this long plot line on the rails then start detouring to do character development I’ll be ecstatic.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats the thing though.  they are stealing plot points directly from wizard of oz stories
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "do you believe in destiny?"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is straight from oscar diggs storyline
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): where he is transported by hot air balloon into a mysterious world. (the land of OZ)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need to fucking read these
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and told that he is destined to become king
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and to bring peace and harmony to the land
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which is DIRECTLY in salems speach in episode one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I can't tell if you're excited or upset about all this 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "Even the most brilliant lights eventually flicker and die, and when they are gone darkness will return.
So you may prepare your guardians, build your monument to a so called 'free world'. But, take heed. There is no victory in strength."
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im excited because im right
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Matt (mattmyers25): Does that mean Ruby will destroy Salem and like in The Wizard of Oz husband will become the leader of all of. All the land
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ruby is the key to all of this
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she or dorothy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she is*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s the flavor of rwby that’s important to me. Anyone can copy the classics, but to make it a new story takes skill. The world of remnant is a great setting and I don’t want the setting to drop off for the cookie cutter.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~so which magic lamp has the munchkins in it~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont think they will all be lamps
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think the school emblems have to do with what the relics are
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): havens was a lamp
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): or a  flame
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): altas will be a torch or a sword of some sort
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Probably torch. Theme of lights.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I wonder what Beacon's will be
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): must be a streetlamp
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I feel like an axe would be too obvious?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): could be the wreath behind it??
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but beacon is "destruction"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so an axe would make sense
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): based on what the relics are
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Knowledge,  creation, choice, destruction
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): vacuo would be choice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which makes sense because the emblem is three swords
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe you can only pick one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Or the third sword is the third option; you take both and combine them.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Looking up theories... this person fucking nailed it *months* ago
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m a fan of spitting in the face of no win scenarios and the you must choice often is.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): http://rwby.wikia.com/wiki/Thread:558516?useskin=oasis
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): guys
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...what if jaunes sword is the sword relic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): why else woud they but so much emphasis in that it was a hand me down from his great great grandpa
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): who fought in the war
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~and why they play out Jaune to be important~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~he has to fulfill *his* destiny~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That thought crossed my mind earlier.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~listen i hate making jaune important, but after rewatching that first episode like 8 times today i'm realizing the fortold us all of this~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Leanna, when you talk about the Oz stories, do you mean the original ones by L. Frank Baum?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): those, PLUS every other endition
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): such as
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the movies
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the stage plays
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): even shows
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): there are allusions to every one of them throughout the entirety of rwby so far, i guess to make it as original as possible without directly ripping off the wizard of oz story
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like currently i think we're about to get some heavy "wicked" shit from this salem story the genie is about to tell
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but its also very closely following "oz the great and powerful"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but earlier on, during like vol 2-3 it was more closely following the original books by baum
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I want to read these now lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): For some rainn we only have the 6th book?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lmao??? thats weird to only have one ..and its the 6th
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but yes you totally should, theyre really good books
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): plus it will help understand rwby ;D
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~scours the internet for pirated PDFs~*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Bless, it's technically legal*
https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55/55-h/55-h.htm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): there you go!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm trying to make an argument for Taiyang and Summer being Uncle Henry and Aunt Em... all I got is Henry is a farmer (Taiyang gardens) and Em is described as having gray eyes (Summer has silver) ...but it seems like kind of a stretch 😂
Jess (whoozica): Zwei is Toto
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's a given lol
Jess (whoozica): Ye
Erik (Red Riot Thot): DOES THAT MEAN ZWEI WILL EXPOSE OZPIN?
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): speaking of zwei, bring back zwei vol 6
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): please
Erik (Red Riot Thot): PLEASE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i actually think oscar is toto, also the "curtain"~~

~~Zweii is too~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it would explin why "rosegraden" is a thing. why oscar got close to ruby so quick. because hes her companion.. ~~hes her doggy LOL~~
Jess (whoozica): 👀
Erik (Red Riot Thot): FUCK YOU RIGHT
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also can we appreciate his character development because he's definitely losing trust in Ozpin
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he definitely wants nothing to do with ozpin
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~low key wanna do a wizard of oz x rwby cosplay group one day~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~and meet miles and kerry and just wiggle our eyebrows at them~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oof that’d be worth going to rtx to see.
