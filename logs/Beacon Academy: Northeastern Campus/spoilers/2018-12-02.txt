Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah, the opening made it pretty obvious
snow ( karma chameleon ): IM LATE TO THE PARTY BUT FIBALLY RUBY HAD AN EPISODE
snow ( karma chameleon ): YEEHAW
Marisa (Weeb): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): This episode made me happy

Everyone is now away from the apathy so hopefully everyone can start to get theirselves gogehfsr.
Mark (Mad Doctor): The large passages in the journal were in English, but the smaller text was Latin. Part of me wants to freeze frame and translate in the off chance it's not ipsum lorem boilerplate. The other part is really lazy and knows that some internet gnome has done it already
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Aww, does that mean remnant doesnâ€™t have its own language?
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think they speak Basic Remnantese and Australian Remnantese
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I was hoping Remnant had a language and script. Monty was the type to make one.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just checked. It is indeed "ipsum lorem". Disappointing.  Despite the Gravity Falls feel of the journals, there were no hidden secrets within. One did get tested, though, so that's something
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey pointed out that the song playing behind the Ruby/Qrow scene was a slowed down version of "All things must die"
