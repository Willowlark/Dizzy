Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm in shock
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That episode just flipped my theory on its ass. They had us believing ozpin was the wizard all along. But in actuality, salem is the wizard and ozpin is elphaba and I'm honestly SCREAMING
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I dunno about the theory craft, but I do like the way that played out.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wasn't a fan of the 'evil chessmaster headmaster' trope.
Mark (Mad Doctor): So...much...meme potential.
"Mr. Stark...?"
"TEN THOUSAND YEARS....!!!"
Mark (Mad Doctor): And so many cosplans
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm liking the ability of Vol. 6 to surprise me. I felt like that didn't happen for the past few years
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They've got me hella excited, mostly for what all the character's reactions are.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is Qrows flask an antique?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~excited for exposition, despite the overdose we get of it~~
Halim (Greg): Oof I liked that episode
Halim (Greg): Also
Halim (Greg): 4 maidens are actually Ozpins 4 reincarnating daughters?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): the run time was 26 minutes. I'm glad they pushed the running time rather than spliting it. This was a fancy as hell version, but this *is* technically a world of remnant.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 20 bucks the silver eyes is tied back to Oz and Salem.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Art and animation were both really good
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Apparently they are the start of every single legend.
Halim (Greg): Except for the two brothers gods
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's not a legend anymore.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Did I catch the genie call them "the brothers Grimm"? I wasn't sure
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She did.
Marisa (Weeb): Haven’t seen it yet bUT I KNEW IT I CALLED IT 
Vindication
Mark (Mad Doctor): Clever
Halim (Greg): Yes sir you did
Mark (Mad Doctor): I had thought the whole "fairy tale" theme died with Ruby's letter at the end of Vol. 4. Cool that they picked it up again in this way
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So if the gift of magic is a thing that stays with the human, and therefore can be passed down and used despite the god's leaving Remnant (such a great world name), if Oz and Salem did pass the trait down would it degrade over time or stay as strong as the age of magic?
Halim (Greg): Degrade over time
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fairy tales are the entirety of the relic nonsense.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Did they once imply that the maiden power diminished?
Halim (Greg): The only reasons the daughter have full power is cause both parents are magic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't think so. I think the maidens would be an exception anyway, as they reincarnate.
Halim (Greg): Yeah maidens are like oz reincarnation and all
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> so we got images of the relics, how on point were you?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): On point for all except the choice one
Marisa (Weeb): Nevermind im half asleep my theory was wrong dab emoji
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I didnt think it would be a crown
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But alas
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I like it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~inb4 Pyrrha was wearing the relic the whole time~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ruby's arc in Vols 1-4 was her disillusionment with fairy tales and her realization that she was responsible for her own choices. Now that the fairy tales have been revealed to be history, the team can finally step up into their adult roles
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My first thought was the sword looks like it could be used by Weiss, but now I'm thinking it will fall to Jaune.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Jaune is a maiden
 Knew it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Jaune would be stupid enough to use a priceless relic to stab *not slash* people~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Monica can now do hair down Salem too.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So ... after all of that I'm still confused as to why ozpin kept this all a huge secret
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And went as far as to nearly attack ruby
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's why I REALLY need to see the reactions.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think I want to cosplay Remnant's moon. Now with "kablooey!" action
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He might still love Salem, even after all she's done, so he doesn't want to show the extent of what's happened. Or, he may be ashamed he was played by her.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea but for oscar to be so adamant that they " find out what hes done"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Or, he wanted to protect Oscar's young eyes from Genie tiddy~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like??? Boi???
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oooooh good point.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm guessing that he fears his quest will become public knowledge. If someone learns they can summon the apocalypse by bringing them together...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Now *that's* fodder for a rwby campaign.
Mark (Mad Doctor): BTW I like the explanation for "Renmant"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YUP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also the brother's are fantastic. Antagonistic yet allies.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Seems Tolkienesque
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And using eastern/european dragons for their battle forms is on POINT
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Let us be diametrically opposed...until humanity gets uppity. Then let's fuck them up together"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): The dragon design seems inspired by DnD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nice catch. They're both eastern though.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Zombie dragon for the younger brother, traditional Chinese dragon for the older.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ye but this is definitely a reference to the gods
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Chinese dragons aren't represented in a lot of DnD source books.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye definitely. Shows the decay of the legend of the ages.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Gold dragons, the really good ones, are.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh true... They were eastern in design...
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): From 1e monster manual
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Probably doesnt mean anything but funny how yang is also a sunny little dragon <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Mark (Mad Doctor): Goddess!!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oof okay I'm not familiar with the 1e interpretation
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): but 3.5 is more of a weird mix.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Got the Art and Arcana book for my birthday. Well worth the price for an old nerd like me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Unrelated to dragons, but I'm glad they're finally showing instead of telling
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This wouldve been the most boring episode if they had stuck to the theme of having a character simple tell us the story with no visuals
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But they did great with the whole showing us through jinn thing
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Shut up, Qrow. The animators have this one."
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Mark (Mad Doctor): I liked having the characters appear in the vision, reacting to events. It will make next week's episode more meaningful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Agreed
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Qrow: “Hey.” *raises hands*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): FUCKKKKK
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also Monica now needs to do preggers Salem
you want fucking rwby chibi?: _salem fucks???_
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's like saying Voldemort fucks
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *oh wait...*
you want fucking rwby chibi?: _what is this i hear about salem fucks????_
Mark (Mad Doctor): You may want to be surprised on that issue
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Leanna might have done insight on this since I haven't read it yet, but literally the 3rd Oz book is *Ozma of Oz*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So on that, I overlooked ozma because shes a child princess. But I shouldnt have because she is turned into a boy at some point with no memory of who she was, but during the story she realizes shes sharing a mind with the boy she was turned into. Shes sharing him like oscar and ozpin are.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): FUCK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also this is interesting too: 

Ozma immediately likes dorothy and after first meeting they immediately become best friends. Throughout all the books dorothy is ozma closest relationship. 


So, rose garden basically. Or why oscar opened up to ruby. Also probably why ozpin/oscar keep  ruby so close the whole series so far.
Mark (Mad Doctor): It takes some ballsy Remnant parents to give their kid a name that starts with Oz- or Os-
Georgia (Something Sensible): So who’s gonna get some zentai suits and make some horns
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was thinking the same thing. You need yellow, midnight blue, and maybe genie-colored
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Finally watched the episode! And oof that was damn good. Glad to finally get a hell of a lot of back story :o
Also did anyone else get ATL vibes from the stuff happening with the God's and their locations? XD
Halim (Greg): Yall imagine
Halim (Greg): Salem could have fought Ozpin all this time
Halim (Greg): By just making sure nobody ever named their kid Oz-somethjng
Halim (Greg): That's the real reason the colo tradition began, it's her campaign to destroy the Oznamed
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Soooo Ozpin incarnation display group?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@288513265661902858> <@386567060026556417> <@170686358535274497>
Halim (Greg): Hell yes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm torn...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I would want to do this snacc
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or this guy because it's literally just me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~low key kinda wanna do Human Salem. Sorry <@!387456543421104150>  im stealing your girl XDD~~
Halim (Greg): ~~or you guys could do a Salem variant group too~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO yesss
