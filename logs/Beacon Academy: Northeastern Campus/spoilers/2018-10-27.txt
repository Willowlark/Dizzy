ZombieHunter: 
Erik (slendergiant): Ok, rewatched the first episode and I noticed in the credits there's the old lady and it zooms in on her goggles then cuts to a close up of Ruby's eyes. She definitely is/was a silver-eyed warrior
Matt (mattmyers25): Did they show off the new intro?
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah it's at the end
Erik (slendergiant): ALSO ROMAN'S BOWLER IS FLYING IN THE BREEZE SO DOES THAT MEAN SOMEHOW HE AND/OR NEO ARE MAKING A COMEBACK?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Do we know anything about Ruby's grandparents?
Matt (mattmyers25): Ok. I felt like we disnt see that in theaters
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah I think they had normal rolling credits in the theater
Mark (Mad Doctor): They actually cut the end theme in our theater
Erik (slendergiant): PREVIOUS OZPIN INCARNATIONS?

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): If they bring back roman and neo I will honestly have a heart attack from too much feeling
Erik (slendergiant): This is definitely Cinder
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Erik (slendergiant): LMFAO
Erik (slendergiant): LEANNA THAT IS A CHILD
Erik (slendergiant): WITH AN OLD MAN INSIDE HIM

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Guys Iâ€™m super concerned for my bird husband
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also IF THEY BRING NEO BACK ILL BE HAPPY
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But also concern for my bird husband
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ok but yall
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): We're gonna get some hardcore back story on salem and ozpin
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cause im 100% sure that those are all his previous incarnations, and they have actual character models
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): AND I'm positive the women standing jn front of the statue is actually salem before she went grimm
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ooo, good call. And if Qrow gets yoinked by Grimm before he meets Winter again, there will be a fandoms riot. Personally, I think the Atlas military is going to pull a Deus ex machina late in the season when things get bad for our girls. I think the letter Qrow sent to Ironwood is meant to foreshadow that
