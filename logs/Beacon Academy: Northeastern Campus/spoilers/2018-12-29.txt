Matt (mattmyers25): Welp, time for the feels this episode
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Help I've even fucking murdered by this episode
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I cant stop crying wowowowowoowoww
Matt (mattmyers25): Damn onions
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): MY FUCKING
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): THIS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My faith is 100% percent restored.
Matt (mattmyers25): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Somehow getting me interested in *Emerald and Mercury*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leaf "Oh no"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Statue: "Oh no"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Voice: "OH NO"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *It's like every dream scenario in one*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Literally all it needed was her saying 'I'm proud of my daughter'
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That or, her saying like, 'goodbye Jaune' cause she KNEW IT WAS HIM from all the letters home Pyrrha must have written and when she saw him she knew he needed to hear everything she said anddddda aahahaaaahahahhhhhhh
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): AND SHE DID
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm a MESS, thanks RT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): she definitely knew.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Never* been this emotional for an episode of RWBY.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): THEN JNPR ACTUALLY TALKS ABOUT FEELINGS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *fuck team RWBY, JNPR can be the stars*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was literally listening to them walk with his sister and I wanted Jaune to say 'this mission isn't about Salem, it's about... a girl...'. I was disappointed when she left without him talkin about it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): THEN  EVERYTHING CRIES
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): AND OSCAR
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He's being all manly now!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and Ruby telling off Qrow is gold, NO more teachers, no more being led around by the nose. The show is called *RWBY* and we're doing it our way, fuck ageism.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *finally talking about Pyrrha*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I'm so happy they're sad*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tyrian: "Do what you love"
Merc: *quits villainy to become a professional smirk model*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Reddit is emotionless bastards, and are pointing out Oscar is really in control and that might make him Ozpin.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Jaune probably: "pyrrhas mom has got it going on"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They can do house filler
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They can do 'house filler' as much as they want if I get *HARDCORE* feels from the characters.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It was the endless exposition I could deal with.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): GOD even when they were walking with sister, I had a half second thought 'oh that not Pyrrha'.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Then they rode THAT train to tearstown.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is it weird I'm more into Merc getting redeemed than Emerald?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Merc's Dad == All for One
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WOW WHAT THE FUCK ROOSTER TEETH
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Mercs backstory hits me too hard. Fucking ouch dude. 
I'm hoping he gets redemption more than emerald too bill
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They finally did it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): just.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): everything is right.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ruby is finally being ruby
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm living
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): With this level of characterization and EMOTION, less combat is OKAY.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I love that Jaune starts talking to Ren and Nora by apologizing, then they say 'this' has to stop.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The problem isn't that he's made mistakes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's that he thinks they'll hold his hurt against him.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OH
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): god.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanna do this shot.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *reopening the episode was a bad idea*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Me, at me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Over the shoulder shot of Georgia as Pyrrha, Photoshop her to be silver and metallic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YUP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'll need to be on a fucking ladder to get that angle but the FEELS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That and playing with some kind out of focus effect on the statue...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Blake's reaction at Jaune's plan is gold
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OH INSPIRATION how I've missed thee
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can't wait to be traveling and for my parents to ask why I'm randomly squeeing.
Georgia (Something Sensible): GROSS SOBBING I LOVE THEM
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestly the statue scene really wrapped up the Jaune self deprecation nicely
Georgia (Something Sensible): That was starting to get a little annoying
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also love how they brought Jen back to voice ~~Mrs. Nikos~~ the "red haired woman"
Matt (mattmyers25): That was a nice touch

Halim(Greg)(jake)(Ent)(Not greg): It's a sad shot hush
Georgia (Something Sensible): “Here’s your daughters crown... but uhhh imma need that back. To. Fuse with my own metal. Thanks”
Halim(Greg)(jake)(Ent)(Not greg): "Look we had a lot of sexual and romantic tension and this is the only way it could be resolved post mortem"
