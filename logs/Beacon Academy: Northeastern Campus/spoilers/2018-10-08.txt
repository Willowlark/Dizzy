Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): :X i AM in the spoiler channel but idk if yall want that much spoilers in here ...............................................
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~why did they design Sienna Khan so well only to kill her off in her introduction?~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Rumor has it that we see Neptune again tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): If not for a hot moment
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also small Weiss outfit update
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): something about a scarf and tights?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~sun leaves~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~no shit, if you can't be involved in the dragonball collecting RT can't write your character~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did I say dragon ball? I meant maidens.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): or magic lamps.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): or...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): sigh
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): First comment on reddit for the live stream.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): listen, i was fully expecting RT to force MORE characters on the ozpin train to atlas
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im low key glad theyre dispersing them
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also yea weiss has red thigh highs <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If I had *any* confidence RT could give a smaller group of characters the character development they deserve, I'd be cool with it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But as it is, we'll get 11 episodes of Ozpin expositioning about the fucking maidens, then a crap shoot fight like the haven fight.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~red?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is White Rose confirmed or someshit, damn.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~apparently they dont go stright to atlas, they go to "argos" because apparently we need more towns to stop at before the actual plot happens~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~that's okay, I care more about the interpersonal character development than the dragon balls anyway~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also no, weiss is wearing red because her granfather wore red
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~but ill take whiterose too~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): saw a comment like that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need to see this, cause that's blue and red and I'm like 'does that work'?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Jess (whoozica): red tights and blue dress? and white hair? ~~and an american flag~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Good old RT.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): weiss had red in her original outfit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WEISS IS BEST AMERICAN
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): subtle red yeah.
Jess (whoozica): oh true, i leetle bit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): not her whole legs.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea i dont know what the legs are gonna look like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): kinda scared
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i havent heard anyone BASHING it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): must not be bad
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): scarf sounded cute.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also ?? adam is just murdering people for even bringing up blake now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): guys a fucking lunatic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~So the plot of the books will suck too?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean. Adam is a better villain than Salem.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (sorry monica)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): valid tbh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): salem looks cool tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Salem is just 'oooo, look at me, Ozpin says I'm eviiiiil' while Adam stabs your mom.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd like it if they focused on Adam as a primary villain.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~anything to get away from the dragonball maidens~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ah, apparently the stockings are blue.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RT and DC are doing a comic next year, Genlock and RWBY.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~couldn't get Marvel huh~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I skipped the episode summary.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Marvel was like "yikes the -gestures to all of it-"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Unless everyone goes looking it up, might as well leave it as a surprise for RWBY premiere.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ```What’s the central theme of this volume? Nothing easy to talk about pre-release. “It’s part of a big lesson that needs to be learned by some people this season and hopefully you’ll learn it by the end too.” 
```
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~code for they don't even know~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMFAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FCUK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IDK WHY THAT MADE ME LAUGH THIS HARD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm comedic gold.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm tearing up wtf
Jess (whoozica): ~~ren and nora forgot to use birth control thats the big lesson~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and then they get written out of the show!
Jess (whoozica): AND THEN they get their own show <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you think RT can handle more than one show~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): tbh I expect Gen;lock will cause a quality drop in RWBY. ~~Somehow they'll drop it more~~.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ```Ruby’s character will be undergoing a shift- not a proper edgelord shift but she’ll be a bit more hardened.```

me:
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Jess (whoozica): im jus kidding anyway ~~i know rena nd nora will be useless background characters for the rest o the show RIP~~
Jess (whoozica): thats her, edgelord rwby
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 14 episodes apparently.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): boo, I'm out of content to ferret out.
