Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm 100% positive that the inventor dude saying their dead means next to  nothing about there actual status
Mark (Mad Doctor): You don't trust him...?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: nah
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its more that I think its based off of information thats not  reliable
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: like bill said its more of a presumption than confirmed
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: If he does know for a fact
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: then I definitely don't trust him
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm getting Lord Douchebag vibes from that character
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ye mood
Mark (Mad Doctor): And nobody has speculated yet how Gen:Lock tech fell into union hands
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they said how it did
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they caught old chase
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oh, right
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just saw the latest HtTyD. My son was pissed at the number of squirmy loud three year olds in the theater, and he made his displeasure clear in that charming ASD way of his. Can't say he was wrong.
Some good moments, but pretty thin as far as story and theme goes. We learned to believe in ourselves, trust in the power of love, make the world better for the next generation, and realize that all human activity upsets the balance of nature.  Astrid was effectively reduced to cheerleader for Hiccup, but her armor will inspire a thousand cosplayers. Decent villain doing a Christopher Walken impression
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Reasons to believe chase's family is alive
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: This is from the training episode before the Ether or whatever crashes
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Its chase's sisters avatar
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Also it's not just a happenstance
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: This is right before it cuts out
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Thats her avatar and chases  avatar
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they're the last two we see, she's looking directly at him, he has her back to her
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and it kinda looks like she might be reaching or getting ready to move towards him,
