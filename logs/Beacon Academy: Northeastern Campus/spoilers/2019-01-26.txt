Mark (Mad Doctor): My rule for new series is to give it three episodes. The first two are usually establishing characters and setting. Sometimes it takes more time (I didn't care for RWBY until Ozpin yeeted the cast off a cliff)
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Does anyone know around what time RWBY gets uploaded for First members?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 11am
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): On the dot
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Oof
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Thanks!
Anna (Cadmium): Can we expect voice chat about ep at exactly 1min after rwby ep or
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm down
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I have time to kill before my tat
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And I'll be sobbing I'm sure
Anna (Cadmium): You're getting a bee tattoo while sobbing about bees
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Sounds like a pain in the ass
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ba dum tsss
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Good one dad
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Is tomorrow finally the day that the ass bee happens??~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeaaaaaa it is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙌 Ass bee~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): All hail the ass bee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have to ask... why the ass cheek?  👀 lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Is it getting colored?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I dont think I'm gonna get it colored, im getting another bumbleby related tattoo later on that's more visible xD this is is basically a joke but I still want it to look good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm getting it on my ass because bumbleby owns my ass
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao. You right. It does XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Woop time to mute this channel until home from work. Have fun watching ya'll~  <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> See ya with my thoughts laterrr
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 🙏
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Same, we might not be home at 11
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Guys why are we excited.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This episode means no new RWBY for months.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): New Cinder, Neo outfits, *Summer Rose*, Atlas is fucking flying.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~kinda anticlimactic as a finale, the Adam fight was a better end game~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And the stinger existed to confirm Leanna’s monkey theory.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Flying harambe~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leviathan confirmed more powerful than ~~Kevin~~ the dragon?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FLYING MONEYS BITCH
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Monkey
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I FUCKING CALLED IT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RWBY NEEDS longer episodes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fuck genlock getting 24 minutes. We got 24 minutes for the finale, like 10 of them were the credits, 2 for the opening, 2 for ANOTHER genlock ad.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Agreed
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’d have liked a stinger with Ironwood or Winter tho Ngl.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM STILL REELING OVER FLYING MONKEYS BECAUSE IT YET AGAIN IS CONFIRMING MY META THEORY
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): JFJDJJDJDBDBBDB
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Why is Atlas FLYING tho.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s a waste of dust.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~also I don’t like this trend of “hold hands means couple”~~, give me actual relationship status damn~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The Maria Qrow scene was nice. I liked that one. Post battle scene was obnoxiously too short.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Man I’m disappointed in how less hype I am compared to post ep 12.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you dumb fucks I already watched it~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): They REALLY should not have cut the episodes into one
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It felt rushed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And I think fans need to be **politely** vocal about the need for longer episodes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I called that one. They rush so much of the character development already, then they’re trying to do a dramatic ~~asspull~~ silver eyes trigger and that eats most of the runtime...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Because it's really annoying to me that genlock nis getting more attention from RT than their flagship show
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Organize the campaign!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also my point from yesterday(?) about how the world feels darker than the show gives us? NOTHING BAD HAPPENED. One building was wrecked. The team got away Scott free. The Grimm was destroyed. No civilian casualties. No names character deaths.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea this episode felt too sanitized
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We speculate all sorts of things based on the tone and we end up with the PG version.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~ep 12 is the season finales~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Especially since they dont have to be worried about YouTube rules anymore
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And just last episode they showed adam getting stabbed through the heart
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The tone wildly swings from one extreme to another
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They’re... I dunno, afraid to take this down a darker path at times.
Anna (Cadmium): That was anticlimactic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YUP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also I 100% will be cosplaying neo again
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): In her new hot ass outfit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The new outfit is ADORABLE.
Anna (Cadmium): Also ahahahhahah now 3 characters got new outfits
Anna (Cadmium): AND WE FUCKING SEE MORE OF HOW HER SEMBLANCE WORKS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEA
Anna (Cadmium): Well. We finally see more of summers outfit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WE SEE SUMMERS HAIR
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Me: “oh Cinder and Neo.”
Me after the scene: “this scene existed for cosplayers”
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): AND IT LOOKS LIKE JAMIES WIG XD
Anna (Cadmium): Neos outfit is on point
Anna (Cadmium): She's definitely heading towards magicians assistant even more
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leanna make the plan for how to politely tell RT to give RWBY more time. I’ll follow along.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I like her off the shoulder sleeves
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And her HAIR
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BITCH THAT HAIR FLOWS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Neo sassing Cinder is good but I really don’t like Cinder as a villain so I’m hoping Neo bails quick.
ZombieHunter: Atlas in the sky was not something i saw coming
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): THE HAIR.
ZombieHunter: but i agree. there wasn't enough in that episode
ZombieHunter: it felt rushed to sacrifice for gen:lock
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yes
ZombieHunter: and i think that's very disappointing
Anna (Cadmium): Agreed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It is
ZombieHunter: Leanna
ZombieHunter: that "so you're gay now?" look from ruby though
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): How do we organize telling RT to fuck off with Genlock and give RWBY the time it deserves.
ZombieHunter: DON'T stop me i thought it was the moment cuz yang really looked away half blushing like i know i know
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Though I will admit Ruby's flashbacks made me cry
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ALSO YEA RUBY WAS LIKE " GOOF FOR YOU BITCH"
ZombieHunter: RIGHT
ZombieHunter: OKAY SO IT WASN'T JUST ME THINKING THAT CUZ I TOTALLY LOVED THAT
ZombieHunter: RUBY'S FLASHBACK REDRAWS WERE SO CUTE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YEAH the flashbacks got to me a bit.
ZombieHunter: I LOVED ALL OF THEM OH MY GOD
Anna (Cadmium): Pain but so cute
ZombieHunter: Mine froze on pyrrha.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): PENNY DEAD HURT ME
ZombieHunter: ... i'm still mad
Anna (Cadmium): ALSO FUCK YES BLAKE HAS NO COAT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The quick cuts for most of them and then the long pause on Pyrrha.
ZombieHunter: But it really shows the life Ruby has had to face
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oof.
Matt (mattmyers25): I like for Ruby's flashback they used concept art
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): RUBT THINKING ABOUT HER FRIENDS DYING FUCJING HURT
ZombieHunter: and all of them really
ZombieHunter: poked at the moments i think the fandom loved and fell in love with the characters from?
Anna (Cadmium): bruh Penny's unfocused aperture eyes fucked me up
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yang holding Blake's hand
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): UGGGGH.
ZombieHunter: yang's posing was deliberate
Matt (mattmyers25): Also, atlus pierced the heavens
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I WANT A GOOD FINALE NOT THIS.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yang HOLDING BLAKES hanD
ZombieHunter: can anyone VC
ZombieHunter: cuz i wanna talk about this
Anna (Cadmium): I'mma sit in on VC if y'all do it I gotta put on makeup
ZombieHunter: imma sit here
ZombieHunter: til someone love me
ZombieHunter: xD
Anna (Cadmium): I'm just gonna sit here with my feelings
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I gotta go get rid of my Slender Giant Swoop ™
Anna (Cadmium): And drink tea and cel shade my face
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ANTICLIMACTIC.
ZombieHunter: i agree
Anna (Cadmium): SO MUCH
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s my whole mood.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I wanted more from this episode
ZombieHunter: So much more should have happened.
ZombieHunter: But like.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is souring the more I think about it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But I'm glad my theory is confirmed
ZombieHunter: Yang's posing was so deliberate
ZombieHunter: so yang on the ship for a bit
ZombieHunter: sits in the way you sit
ZombieHunter: when you wanna be close to someone but you don't know how to get closer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEA
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I need to watch again
Anna (Cadmium): On the other hand. Glad I'm not gonna be pissed waiting for the next season
ZombieHunter: gen lock time!
ZombieHunter: 😄
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Same lmao
ZombieHunter: this season was very satisfying so
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like eh... not really a cliff hanger
ZombieHunter: i can wait the half year for the bees
Anna (Cadmium): We just. Have 9 months
Mark (Mad Doctor): Qrow puts away flask=character qrowth
ZombieHunter: *wiggle dances*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Bees happened so
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm good
ZombieHunter: ^^
Anna (Cadmium): Bees happened. Ruby is badass. Neo got new outfit and cinder doesn't look like a hobo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also yea qrow being in the moment and putting his flask away
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): good
Mark (Mad Doctor): Loved Ruby's flashback sequence
ZombieHunter: Might come by to hang out IF you want company leanna
ZombieHunter: no wait
ZombieHunter: you said you were going away
ZombieHunter: nvm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I gotta get my tat at 3 my boi
ZombieHunter: HEY WAIT
ZombieHunter: YEAH we said drinks after?
ZombieHunter: maybe?
ZombieHunter: bee drinks?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Note the layout of Atlas: high city of the Schnees and the low city of the faunus. Eloi and morlocks
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I gotta go to my moms after xD so not today  :c
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The season was great. The finale was disappointing. I’m inclined to boycott genlock just because.
ZombieHunter: aw okay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeaaaa its very telling of the racism in atlas
ZombieHunter: IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Towns here in nj are like that...
ZombieHunter: i couldn't tell on my phone
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Rich people live up high on the mountain
ZombieHunter: I wouldn't only because I've also signed up as an admin for a new gen lock group
Mark (Mad Doctor): GenLock is pretty good. Still gonna give it three episodes to judge
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And the poor people are at the bottom
Mark (Mad Doctor): Only saw the first episode so far
ZombieHunter: My biggest concern is RT pumped a LOT of money into this
ZombieHunter: even if just for voices - they're pumping a lot of work into GL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea....
Erik (Red Riot Thot): FLYING MONKEYS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEA ERIK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MY THEORY IS CONFIRMED
ZombieHunter: she's the wicked witch
Mark (Mad Doctor): They know RWBY has a dedicated fan base. They need to build support for GL so they're using RWBY as a springboard
ZombieHunter: with her flying monkeys
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IT CONFIRMS FUCKING EVERYTHING
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ALSO WE GOT TO SEE TAIYANG AND SUMMER SO THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME
Mark (Mad Doctor): Need Zwei to return
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO GOOD
ZombieHunter: mood mark

ZombieHunter: LEANNA
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm gonna remake Pyrrha and make Neo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Rip me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Bye
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Help
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It can still be canon Leanna. Illusions
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): True
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Were all neo actually
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also ruby using jinn
ZombieHunter: that was very clever
ZombieHunter: she used her like a life pause
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THAT WAS SMART
ZombieHunter: and jinn was so amused
Matt (mattmyers25): Did you notice ruby's flashbacks were art not scenes from previous series? They were different from the animation
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh I'm crying again because qrow 100% was seeing summer when ruby was standing up for herself
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm a mess
ZombieHunter: they were redraws
ZombieHunter: yeah
ZombieHunter: <@!155492347122155520>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also nevermore is a bee song calling it now
ZombieHunter: IT WAS SO GOOD I NEED THE LYRICS
ZombieHunter: i'll have them tomorrow from flynt on youtube but still
ZombieHunter: the score on genlock is fantastic
ZombieHunter: wow
Mark (Mad Doctor): Agreed
ZombieHunter: the chase thing threw me for a bit
ZombieHunter: i'm also not sure i'm okay with it
ZombieHunter: that
ZombieHunter: that was a good pilot ending
ZombieHunter: liking the theme song more now that i've gotten a show mood
ZombieHunter: i think
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Can we take genlocks willingness to show on screen kisses and put some of that in rwby
Mark (Mad Doctor): If chases sister was killed I'm gonna riot
ZombieHunter: mood leanna
ZombieHunter: and same mark
ZombieHunter: that would not be cool
ZombieHunter: i think it's getting pretty interesting i'm almost half through episode 23
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm still not invested.. but I'll give it another episode
ZombieHunter: i'm getting there
ZombieHunter: they're putting a good mix of emotional and action in here
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hazel: “there’s an old phrase... if you want something done right do it yourself”
Salem:*Creates an army to do thing for her*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm just waving goodbye to their entire budget watching it LMAO
ZombieHunter: mood
ZombieHunter: is miles playing the hispanic guy?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeah
ZombieHunter: yeah i figured
ZombieHunter: i could hear it in his ennunciation
ZombieHunter: i love tennant
Mark (Mad Doctor): Tennant chews scenery even when it's digital
ZombieHunter: he's so natural
ZombieHunter: but he's also. very him
ZombieHunter: the music is so good though
ZombieHunter: i'm like. in love with these beats
Mark (Mad Doctor): His accent is more evident in GL than it was in Dr Who

Also, I kinda like the design of the old school Mecha better than Chase's Voltron
ZombieHunter: theyre soothing and also very just. mentally connecting
ZombieHunter: this is true mark - they're letting him put himself into it more than making the doctor into what he had to become ish
ZombieHunter: i want
ZombieHunter: the tiny cat bot
Mark (Mad Doctor): I kind of see Tennant as Robin Williams doing the genie. Just let him be himself and we'll work around it
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cat bot was good
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t really have a problem with it (I noticed it, but last time we’re going to see the mech (hopefully)) but more to the cutting corners.
ZombieHunter: io want the song from when rwby starts flashing back
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Cordovin be like
Erik (Red Riot Thot): MY DRILL IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS
Mark (Mad Doctor): Immo drill that drill where the Grimm don't shine
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Her drill pierced the heavens
Jess (whoozica): It's not just holding hands that makes you canon it's holding hands *on an airship* 
*After one of you deals with your painful past*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Any one notice how Jaune "Third Wheel" Arc is sitting between Ren and Nora in the final scene?
Jess (whoozica): Omg yes 😂
Jess (whoozica): When the showed the monkays I was like "FLYING MONKEYS Leanna knows everything"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😎 👉 👉
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I spent like 4 years conspiracy theorizing rwby
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Does that mean Ruby is gonna melt the witch with water? <:pewish:420824457918152704>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The shallow sea might have something to do with it <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Mark (Mad Doctor): "We have Salem trapped! Neptune, bring the water!"

"Oh, shit..."
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Finally got home from work and saw the finale. I am dead from the moments, but overall I gotta agree run time is so short I feel a bit stiffed.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): So many new cosplans I wanna do thooooo 😵
Jamie (Jamie): Omfg summer fucking cannon design and fuck me up my wig is already perfect now just need to make a rose bun in the back of it AHHHHHHH
Jamie (Jamie): ~~wishing i had time to remake and wear summer to katsu but i don't~~
Jamie (Jamie): If anyone is interested I found the link for what should be the same wig that i've been using for summer. 
I literally recommend mainly cause it can take a beating and still be awesome imo
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Spent over 9000 hours in ms paint piecing together screenshots to get a full view shot to help all of us who instantly stuck neo Neo on our cosplan list
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THANK YOU
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): No prob 🤗
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Doing the lord's work
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I can't tell if Cinder is looking at Neo like a proud mom or a snacc
Anna (Cadmium): What the fuck are those pants neo
Mark (Mad Doctor): Garter boots
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's EXACTLY WHHT I SAID
Anna (Cadmium): What the fuck are those SLEEVES Neo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Exactly what I said too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Neo joining the shirtless sleeves bandwagon, but shotski wearing a shirt
Anna (Cadmium): Neo joining the physically impossible clothing bandwagon
Anna (Cadmium): But also. 
Fuck yeah. Blake ditched her jacket
Anna (Cadmium): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Qrow's face
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Blake :/
Anna (Cadmium): 
Anna (Cadmium): 
Anna (Cadmium): 
Anna (Cadmium): Ren looks like Ruby just dropped an F bomb
Erik (Red Riot Thot): D:
Anna (Cadmium): Nora: :0
Jess (whoozica): Beautiful
Georgia (Something Sensible): _matching icons for you and the squad_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): HOLY SHIIIITTT.
1. Flying. Monkeys. Hmmm .... 👀 🤔 
2. Why is Jamie's Summer Rose cosplay she did a year almost perfectly identical to what we saw of her today?? 😮 Like what.. 
3. Atlas, wtf? O.o
4. Neo and Cinder's new outfits 👌 ~~Also for some reason I've been liking Neo a lot more
5. Salem you a nut case. Making even more cray ass Grimm.
6. Emerald doesn't seem down for what Salem is doing anymore. Anyone else think the same
Matt (mattmyers25): Emerald is going to mess the plan up
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah, she's not evil, just kinda bad. And surrounded by some real crazies. It won't take much to nudge her conscience
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel she's gonna bail being with Salem at some point.
