Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You know what we’re probably not getting in the finale? The rest of the team comforting Yang and Blake about the two making their first ever human kill.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The tempo will be too high with the ~~pacific rim~~ robot ~~genlock ad~~ battle for a downer scene like that.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk fam
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theyre combining two episodes and usually the last episode is the cool down after the huge fight
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did they confirm it was two episode length?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): didnt confirm the length but they confirmed that they put the last two together
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I assumed they just dropped an episode to give genlock more love. So that’ll mean less time for non crucial scenes.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they didnt drop it, they just squished it in with this episode
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im a little worried it'll feel rushed
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not to say that kind of discussion isn’t crucial, but RT has a habit of putting character development in the backseat for MOAR RELICS.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m figuring it’s half of each of the originals, so lots of cuts.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’d be a good conversation for Qrow to finally get his shit together for. Uncle special agent of Ozpin knows what it’s like.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Instead of a 13 minute episode, we'll get a 14 minute episode
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): extended genlock preview
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so its actually 10
Erik (Red Riot Thot): end credits
Erik (Red Riot Thot): so actually 7
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nice
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats a good amoutn of time
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im sure everything will be resolved
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeet relic into ocean, Grimm goes after it.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): anyone have any serious predictions?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eh not really. I tend to enjoy being along for the ride with the characters.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Experience their surprise with them.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): someone is probs gonna die
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I can see Cordovin getting killed, but probably also an important character too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Probably Maria or Qrow
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~please not Qrow~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): qrow has the most death flags obviously
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk if they will kill him yet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i really think someones getting kidnapped
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk if itll be ruby, bt oscar maybe
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or both
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): true
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): toto and dorothy got kidnapped
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But yeah definitely worried about it being rushed. There's a lot of things that they started that never got looked at again and it would seem out of place if they didn't come back again this volume e.g. Cinder/Neo, Watts/Tyrian
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Emerald/Merc
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaaa i agree,i feel like they might push then until vol 7... but then what was the point
Erik (Red Riot Thot): exactly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): watts/tyrian , and em/merc i can see being pushed because they werent a HUGE focus
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but if they dont have cinder/neo in the finale im gonna be disappointed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they made such a big deal that neo was back
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and made a point to show that neo was working with cinder
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and that they were going after ruby
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Both Neo/Cinder and Watts/Tyrian are headed for Atlas. I could see maybe the two groups meeting up in the post credits scene, setting up the central villains for V7
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that probably will  happen youre right
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i hate it, but
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): makes the most sense with the time constraints
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's been nice not having a bunch of different side plots now that the team is all back together, but at the same time, they could have shown more of what the villains are up to
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaaaa especially if they want us to care about them
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, when was the last time we even saw Salem?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): when she learned ozpin reincarnated already and screamed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but that leads me to believe salem will be in the finale
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, I’m good with less of the big bads. Give them to us in pieces now that we’ve been introduced.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hence why i think someones getting kidnapped
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~~that was episode 4 what the fuck~~*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like that's very likely
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm also banking on Atlas military showing up
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh yea definitely
Erik (Red Riot Thot): okay, but like.... what if....
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Penny
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 2.0
Erik (Red Riot Thot): comes to save the day
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'll fucking die
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because that would be perfect timing for me to debut penny at katsu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBYqzt8aKYI&list=PLUBVPK8x-XMiUsXLqroy7qkS5cN1NQK5M&index=12
Erik (Red Riot Thot): was this actually foreshadowing?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'll fucking die
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i also will fucking die
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like literally dead
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But she'd likely have a brand new character design RIP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): def
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I dunno, Cinder doesn't have the MO to kidnap Ruby. Everyone on the villain team (asides from Adam) is more on the 'kill order' type.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): prob a different personality
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Penny would be a *mean* cliffhanger for v7.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): neo
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Neo wants her dead too.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ,... kinda. No one knows what Neo wants.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): neo has no beef with ruby.....shes just agreeing with cinder
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But if Neo does it, Cinder will be involved and Cinder going to go all Pyrrha on her.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): In terms of the kidnapping, I feel like it'd be a grimm grabbing them and taking them to Salem. Cinder is headed for Atlas
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cinder's argument is 'Ruby is responsible for Roman's death more than me'.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think the flying ~~monkey~~ grimm are gonna take ruby
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and oscar potantially
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Can grimm be controlled that well?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we don't know
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They were originally the God of Destruction's creations... I imagine they don't hurt Salem cause she took that gunk bath.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they also dont hurt all of her friends
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and the only one who is part grimm is cinder
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): fair point. I'd just be disappointed in that turn. Why does she need human collaborators anyway, if she has an *undying army of monsters* she could unleash. Not to mention many times in series where it was stated Grimm (bar very old ones) aren't intelligent.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, I think it's supposed to 80% of the world as know is 'controlled' and populated by Grimm?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If she could direct them, it wouldn't be hard to destroy every city.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): well the arguement to that is that where salem lives is basically a grimm nest
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so it would make sense for flying grimm to take the  "food" back to the nest
Mark (Mad Doctor): So what is her relationship to her Grimm Seer pet?  Are they allies? It seems like Salem controlled it pretty directly.  Is the Seer an outlier, or typical of Salem's conneciton to Grimm?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that too! i forgot about the seer grimm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): so she's gambling on the ~~Monkeys~~ grimm actually taking Ruby out of the entire population of Argus?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont think its gambling entirely
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it seems like they are just going in and swooping everyone in argus
Mark (Mad Doctor): OK, so everyone in Remnant knows that Grimm are summoned by negative emotions.  Who in the Atlas Military thought that putting Murder Hobbit in a position of authority was a good idea?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont know entirely, but i really feel like salem has the ability to control certain grimm, or at least create ones she can control
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BIG MOOD MARK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think she realizes she fucked up too, you could see it in her face.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ruby also has the relic so like, direct target for the grimm to snatch her
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): THAT is a good point.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i can see ruby getting snatched up and oscar grabbing onto the grimm and going with her
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Hobbit flashes back:*
Ironwood: "You get this Giant robot."
Hobbit: "HUZZAH ATLAS"
Ironwood: "You can only use it for killing giant Kaiju though."
Hobbit: *grumbling*
Ironwood: "I'll show you how to use the dust missiles now"
Hobbit: "Yes my Furer"
Ironwood: "None of that."
Hobbit: *Grumbling*
Mark (Mad Doctor): So if we're paralleling the WQizard of Oz, I'm thinking of the scene where the witch tries to grab Dorothy's shoes and gets a shock...Salem tries to get the relic and..."BLOOBIES!!!!  I'M MELLLLLTING!!!"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm just imagining this scene with Ruby locked in a tower with the Seer Grimm showing her false visions of her friends in pain
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*oLry4KgZq7V7UzlJrvnsAg.jpeg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OOOOOF
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Every grain of sand in the hourglass is a ship in the rwby universe. When the sand runs out...you die!"

"So...you're saying I'm going to live forever?"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Another stretch of a theory:
> Flying monkey scene from Wizard of Oz
> Scareqrow gets fucked up by Grimm; not killed, but pretty badly fucked up
> Atlas military come and help fend off Grimm
> Ironwoodsman comes to help his friend the Scareqrow
> Raven and Taiyang come also to help
> Cowardly Taion (*boy, that's a stretch*) also helps out his friend the Scacreqrow
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): well, Lionheart is the Lion.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah but he dead
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): *TAION*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and multiple people have been embodying various characters
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wouldn't want Taiyang to have the coward tropes on him.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He's too badass for that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I say, never having seen him fight~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): team strq is supposed to mirror team rwby
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~really, I can't tell by Summer's design~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and if team rwby eludes to the characters then by default team strq must too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I mean, we've only seen him at his home, away from all of the action. We've seen his wisdom and badassery from the comfort of his own home. After Summer died, he may have been too afraid to leave Patch to really go into combat anymore
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but we dont know enough about them to say whos who
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): besides qrow
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but yea, it seems like team strq took the wrong route
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and summer (dorothy of their story) died
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and none of them learned to accept themselves
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Scareqrow resorted to over-lubrication
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wouldnt that be the tin woodsman
Erik (Red Riot Thot): shit yeah
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): qrow resorted to
Erik (Red Riot Thot): just realized that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~this symbolism shit is hard~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm dumb
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): alcohol to get out of his own head
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thus no brain
Erik (Red Riot Thot): who would be the Lion and Tinman of STRQ? I could see Raven as the lion as well since she's afraid to face Salem
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~they really proved that symbolism is a huge part of rwby with that yang fight, so now im like balls deep in this theory again~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but also Taiyang because afraid to leave Patch
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): raven directly parallels blake
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fuck, Tai is the woodsman
Erik (Red Riot Thot): His house is a fucking log cabin
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): raven is the lion
Erik (Red Riot Thot): His weapon is an axe
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm calling it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omg if his weapon is a fucking axe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ill kill someone
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats so on the nose LMAO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can see him using an axe lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Woodsman's backstory is love for a woman
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Taiyang loved two womans
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): didnt the woodsman in the movie have a crush on dorothy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or dual wield hatchets
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is the "oil can"  Qrow's flask? Qrow gives up the booze, and Taiyang gets some liquid courage
Erik (Red Riot Thot): need to do concept art for Taiyang battle axe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): guys, im crying because this season weve seen how ruby is really stepping in to the leader (dorothy role) and qrow is starting to come around
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the way qrow looks at ruby when she stands up for herself makes me think hes seeing summer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and that ties everything together
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ruby will be the glue that brings everyone together again
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not... related to symbolism, but I also like how while Ruby is stepping up as the inspirational leader, Jaune is stepping up as a tactical one. He's thinking, making plans, and not being completely overshadowed by Ruby now that they're one super team.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ruby is hope and inspiration. That's why if she ever breaks... oooooh boy.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea definitely
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): or if shes.... gone
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gone doesn't mean broken though. They can still know she's out there, fighting to get back to them like they will for her.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Broken. Oof.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I dunno what could do that to her though.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She survived Penny and Pyrrha.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Maybe* something with Summer.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaaaa, i dont think theyd break ruby though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what would the point in that be
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): besides to drag the series on lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i dont think they need to break her to do that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, they missed the chance.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I had a spitball theory back in the timeskip between 3 and 4, that it would be JNR who go and get RWBY back together. That'd have been the only time for Ruby to be out of the fight.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): JNR: "get off your asses, Pyrrha is dead and we want to kick some ass"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ruby breaking is very unlikely... She's the bastion, the hope spot. The other girls could have had a *shitter* time in the timeskip (more Adam stalking, Jacques being far more of douche, PTSD) and Ruby would have been their 'light at the end of the tunnel'.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea agreed
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hmm. I'm remembering old complaints I had in the time frame... Particularly with pre beacon fall. Namely they setup this world as one populated heavily by creatures that thrive on negativity, humanity is in a decline, where teenagers are ace combatants because they need to be. It's a rather ~~grim~~ base for the world. Then v1-3 it's a magic high school anime. In the early days I was looking for that original darkness to the world I got from the trailers. I was hoping for more out of v4, and progressively it's started to get closer to a middle ground between sunshine and darkness... But I think that's why I'm still looking to see the *darkness* in the world. It was there from the start, but it just doesn't get shown.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): v3 was pretty dark
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It was the start of it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The tournament arc turned off to it originally.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok so wait back to symbolism, if penny comes back, we already know she is tiktok the clock in the wiz of oz
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so she 100% won't know who she is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but like..... still
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.replicaweaponry.com/media/catalog/product/cache/8/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/2/2/22-1010.jpg
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Tai's weapon
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): isnt that whats his face
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): port
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~so Taiyang is thin Port~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What's his face XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Port's is a blunderbuss
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~mustache face~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and the blades are at the butt of the gun
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh nvm i see what you mean'
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): similar
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but imagine a young Taiyang seeing reports of the brave Peter Port fending off grimm and looking up to him and modeling his weapon after Port's and being super excited to have Port as a professor at Beacon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and then becoming good friends with him post graduation
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oof tho.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Port as a role model.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So Ruby has a sniper scythe. She got the scythe from Qrow. Yang has a shotgun gauntlet. Lets say she got the shotgun part from Qrow. So Taiyang should have *sniper fists*.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but would yang have even based hers off of anyones tbh?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've been trying to think of weapons that could have been inspiration for Ember Celica
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but nothing really comes to mind
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ruby was inspired by Qrow, why not Yang as Daddy's girl.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She got the puns from him.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yang hardly tells puns tbh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i think she has the same fighting style as tai, or at least tai was a close combat fighter
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Not recently no. Idk when the last time she did
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): when she wasn't depressed.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You right. Most of the character stereotypes are derived from chibi... which isn't canon...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): even then, she only had like 1 or two puns the entire show, yang isnt barb
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The only one she really makes is "start off the year with a Yang"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee that one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): -puns +jokes and pranks. When she was happy she had that kind of air.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): sorry thats just a pet peeve of mine, when people ask me to make puns as yang, and im like??? but.. she doesnt even... do that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm just saying she could have got that from Dad, why not her fight style.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shes funny, and happy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but has only done a pun like one time in canon
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): anyway yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think her and tai are close combat fighters
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so if tai has an axe or duel wields axes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theyd be like small hatchets
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The picture I showed looks like it's more on the hatceht scale
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm calling the sniper weapon tho.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): dual wield those bad boys
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *that would be fucking dope*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it sure would
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *still doesn't explain the single spaulder or vambrace*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *but what even is logical character design in RWBY anyway?*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's... a bit shinanigans.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My character in the RWBY game I played had a bow powered by electromagnets.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's... shinanigans. Bad ass as fuck though.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe its adouble sided axe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): or .... an axe crossbow
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'mma pin my bet tho, so I'm accountable.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Called shot: Taiyang will have a sniper type weapon, because Yang got shotguns from Qrow/fists from Taiyang and Ruby got Scythe from Qrow. QED.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I might make a command for Dizzy to keep track of people's bets on things.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I honestly don't think Yang got the shotguns from Qrow. She's honestly not that close with him?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~does qrow have a showgun?~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Harbinger has a shotgun mode
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is one of my Tai weapon concepts but I'm not super thrilled with it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i like the hand grips and that it separates
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe the handle collapses inside?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was also thinking that but it would have to be telescoping and there would be awkward gaps when connected
Erik (Red Riot Thot): unless maybe they fold up like Emerald's
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s easiest to imagine RWBY weaponry if you image the “trailer” for it. Picture how it fits the fighting style, then explain how something so inane actually works.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): id say you could probably look at tai training with yang
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): to kinda get a feel for how tai might fight
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Then match the weapon to the style.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~could also have something on his shoes. he kicks a lot~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he kicks and blocks with his arm with the leather thing a lot
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): gauntlet?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also his fist is always closed on the side with the glove, he primarily fights with that side of his body
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It could be a placeholder for his actual weapon when he's unarmed.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): always kicks with that side
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though, that's against the rwby style of 'carriable weaponry'.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): blocks with that side
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and has all his armor bits on that side
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ooh you're right. just rewatched. he blocks with his right forearm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so thats either oversompensating for no weapon on the other side
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): or thats just the side he has his weapon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Or the armored side is melee focused while the other is more ranged.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~someone pay me to do fight chereography for a living~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/25/rwby-volume-6-finale-sneak-peek-battling-the-leviathan
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I ain't watching that.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): for anyone else who wants to
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): right right.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just took on my Dad's stance on the marvel movie trailers... sometimes it's just better to go in blind.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof IGN is hella laggy on my computer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I go to watch the video and of course a gen:LOCK ad plays before it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): not a whole lot spoiled tbh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea nothing really spoiled
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah nothing spoiled but I'm so HYPE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SAME
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Gambol Shroud seems to be intact?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~why did she even take it~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but ok
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea it looks in tact
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im confused
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also, like... everyones out of aura ruby
Erik (Red Riot Thot): don't see the cleaver sheath though
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There's a song on the v5 soundtrack called "All that Matters".
Mark (Mad Doctor): Any word on episode length?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): where were you when <@!334090409389195266> couldn't stop talking about that song? 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea dude its yang about blake xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i cired for like 5 days
Erik (Red Riot Thot): watch Tai make an appearance tomorrow and his weaon is revealed and I have to pull one out of my ass before Katsu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that would be incredible
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I would be both excited and pissed at the same time xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mood, thats how id feel if penny shows up with a new design
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao. Yeaaa. It'd be nice to see but oof... rip us cosplayers
Anna (Cadmium): Would RT do that
Anna (Cadmium): I mean. Probs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ruby saying out loud that shes a huntress
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): good fucking shit right there
Erik (Red Riot Thot): an unlicensed one, but a huntress nonetheless #DontSellYourselfShort
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mixed up those two messages when glancing quick and I read "Ruby saying fuck out loud" and I was likes yes please good XDD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fhfsjklha
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LET RUBY SAY FUCK
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Let everyone say fuck at least once please
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:legasp:501968781883605002>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Except Ren lets out a *frick*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ruby/Yang: Say Fuck
Tayang: *gasp* where did you learn that from?!
Ruby/Yang: .... Uncle Qrow...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:legasp:501968781883605002>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:blockyhands:484798627752181761> fuck<:blockyhands:484798627752181761>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can see Jaune saying fuck and then feeling bad about saying it, being like omg I did't mean to swear.. I am so sorry XDD Probs cause he mom stressed about them not swearing and saying she'd wash their mouths out w/ soap if they did lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): LET👏RUBY👏SAY👏FUCK👏
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Someone reblogged my Taiyang headcanon post and brought up the valid point that Taiyang could be the hunter from the red riding hood story
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that might be his main origin
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): still think they all relate to the main 4 of wizard of oz though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): everyone in the story does in some way
Erik (Red Riot Thot): agreed
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I couldn't remember if there was a hunter that saved the day in the Goldilocks story because then it would be *very* fitting but there isn't
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Adam AU:
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omggg xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If countdown on RT's Insta is correct, gen:LOCK premieres tomorrow at 10:30am

Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh yeah definitely. He's very light skinned so unless you know his dad is Hispanic you'd never know
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Unrelated to that, still not intrigued by genlock xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Really banking on the episode tomorrow to be good for me to get sucked in
