Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: real talk one of RT's best fights is Donut vs Doc from RVB
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and those characters should be far from the best fighters in RT
Georgia (Something Sensible): @the couple of you who started critical role, is it good?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’ve seen a lot of cosplays but know nothing about the thing itself
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm really enjoying it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: <@!175780732160049152>  knows more
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Its just really long?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I wanna start it too
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I personally couldn't watch/listen to it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: since its basically a podcast
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and I don't do well with that
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: But I found transcripts online and its still a really fun read
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'd suggest starting with the second campaign if you do choose to pick it up
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: since its completely unrelated to Campaign 1 and most cosplayers starting now will probably do stuff from it instead of Campaign 1 due to it being the current thing for the past likeee
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: 44 episodes?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: which are all super super multi hour long things
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah the past 4 seasons are Campaign 2
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Matt Mercer is one of the most well respected DMs out there. By both new and old school players which is VERY hard to do.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its a lot of fun
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Between that and his players all being actors he’s set a high bar for the show.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And I know this never having listened.
Mak (hollyjollymak): What hello I am the Mak, I love the Critical Role
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ((you need DND podcast fan, MAK is the key))
Mak (hollyjollymak): I listen to a great many of them! This is my shit!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It is Mak, otherwise known as <@&481151708286681112>.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thank you random idol group at Katsucon for that perfect role name.
Mak (hollyjollymak): Aaaaaaaah yes! My new role!
Mak (hollyjollymak): Yeah one of them just going “I love your gay DM look” made my whole weekend
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s also going to be album title. Cause. If it wasn’t a mood.
Mak (hollyjollymak): I would expect nothing less from that whole-ass mood
Georgia (Something Sensible): so it is............ good?
Georgia (Something Sensible): tbh i just saw someones pike cosplay and went YEAH
Georgia (Something Sensible): and someone did taako with like? something goin on? prob a spoiler lmao
Georgia (Something Sensible): but it looked coo
Marisa (Mawisa): wow i can't believe u met taako from tv
Mak (hollyjollymak): It’s very good! I highly recommend listening to TAZ and Critical Role
My personal recommendation is to start with TAZ if you don’t want to be bogged down by the rules really quickly, but either one is a good jumping point into DnD actual play podcasts
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've been really wanting to check out Critical Role. I just need to find the damn time T_T
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Jester intrigues me thus is why I want to check it out so badly lol.~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: for people who would rather read cause they can't podcast well:
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: https://crtranscript.tumblr.com/transcripts
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: critical roll transcripts 👍
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Where's the best place to find the Critical Role podcast? 😮
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I saw they have a YT. But didn't get a chance to look too far if much is on there lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: you can watch the video versions on VRV
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: http://criticalrolepodcast.geekandsundry.com/
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thankie~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: this is the regular podcast I'm p sure
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I've been interested too as well, it's just the episode length that's daunting
Tom (tomukuncosplay): If I had a job where I could space all day I'd listen to them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Lol guess we found something new for Erik to do at work XD~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I didn't realize it was a podcast, I thought it was just video.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I could listen to it driving to Armonk.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Tom it's much faster to read which is another reason I'm reading it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's literally what I posted in my story this morning...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But I had to stop because I couldn't pay attention
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol did you? O.o ~~I don't recall. I checked instastories when I was half awake oops.~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~well it didn’t take them 3 season to burn down the safe place for the protagonists~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Good episode for genlock. Not so much... the actual episode, but what it represents. It’s the ragtag heroes versus the world now. They don’t have a home base or support and they’re running blind. That changes the show from a military drama to a more traditional adventure. Depending on how they go from here, could mean good things.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I WILL DIE PLEASE
Mark (Mad Doctor): Not ok with what I just saw. But of course, with cloning and digital consciousnesses, there are all kinds of ways to prevent perma-death in the Gen:Lock universe.  And I think Gen:Lock is doing a good job of what science fiction (as opposed to science fantasy like Star Wars) does well: forcing us to look at what makes us human and the effect technology has on our sense of self
Mark (Mad Doctor): For that reason, I will not be happy if GL becomes a straight adventure story a la volume 4 of RWBY
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have more faith in RT doing an okay adventure story, recon/gurellia ops style than a proper military drama.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They already barely touch on the military as a whole and the intricacies of being part of it.
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's not so much that I crave military drama. I'd rather see a deep delve into some of the issues they've already raised , like ||where does the Self reside if consciousness can be copied and pasted? What defines your personality if you can adjust a slider to change it? Are we defined by our physical selves, even in the digital world?||. So much potential for really good thoughtful series. I'm just worried about them getting distracted by the monster of the week
