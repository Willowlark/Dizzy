Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Reddit: "How did humanity come back after it got Thanos'd"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): welp.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): God of destruction is also purple.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Dust is moon fragments*
Mark (Mad Doctor): So why is the moon intact in the Red Trailer? Oversight or a hint about past/future events?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Probably oversight. Red trailer was just to sell us on the combat, look at how bad the beowolves looked.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~i miss the red trailer~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont think monty had a full story in mind when making the red trailer
Mark (Mad Doctor): Fun fact: Beowulf is the Old English rendering of "Bee-wolf," probably a metaphor for a bear
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Either continuity error or the moon is rotated so that the shattered part is facing the back
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Monty's era wasn't continuity errors, it was more of 'I want this to be an anime at that's not what works'.
