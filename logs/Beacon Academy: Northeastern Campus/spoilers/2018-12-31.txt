Erik (Red Riot Thot): Nora has 3 legs
***C A N O N***

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): It was only a matter of time...
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Noooo
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I cried too much
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): So I want neo to scream
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Cinder needs to overtake
Tom (tomukuncosplay): If Ruby uses her eyes on Salem would that be grimmify her ü§î
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It would probably turn her to stone thus defeating, but not killing her. RWBY solved. Everyone can go home now.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~thats probably how summer died tho~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~trying to use her eyes on salem~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But Ruby is the titular character so she can't die
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because that's how that works
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:valid:420824413592748032>
Tom (tomukuncosplay): YEET
Tom (tomukuncosplay): So if the truth holds that Salem can't die, then she either needs be be imprisoned or change her ways essentially
Mark (Mad Doctor): What if she and Oz replace the god brothers to restore balance to the Force?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They tried that lol that's what started everything pretty much lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i feel like the only way things will be fixed is her learning the weight of "death" ...i think ozpin needs to die, or she needs to accept that their fate was never to be together
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ozpins destiny was to die
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but she didnt accept it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and had him revived, and by doing so she angered the gods ~~douchbags in the sky~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont know how ozpin can die since he is cursed, but i feel that oscar is somehow the key. hes so combative and very NOT like minded to ozpin
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My thought is that when Oz asked "How do I defeat Salem?" Jinn replied with "You can't" and if that's taken literally (which wording is very important when asking a genie a wish or question) doesn't rule out that *someone else* ~~-cough-Ruby-cough-~~ can't defeat her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Mark (Mad Doctor): Salem is the Witch King of Angmar!
Georgia (Something Sensible): How about we stop naming kids with O names for a little bit
Georgia (Something Sensible): _then he can‚Äôt reincarnate_
Tom (tomukuncosplay): ah very true i hadnt thought of that
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Ruby is key
