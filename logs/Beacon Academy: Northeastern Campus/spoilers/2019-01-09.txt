Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's a new winter model ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Unless they just edited it for her poster
Tom (tomukuncosplay): hopefully ðŸ™Œ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Pretty sure that's from the Weiss trailer 

Like right before she's like "I'm not always going to be around to save you Weiss"
Mark (Mad Doctor): "I mean, I could be gone for three whole seasons..."
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I'd love if she came in and helped everyone but that's not happening. XD I'm just gonna have to wait another year
Anna (Cadmium): ugh watch she'll be part of the cliffhanger into the next season
Mark (Mad Doctor): Weiss' reaction was interesting when Winter was mentioned last week
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly that would give me hope
Matt (mattmyers25): What are the odds of either someone dying this week or getting hurt?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Does qrows liver count?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ha.
Matt (mattmyers25): No
Mark (Mad Doctor): 3-2 odds on Adam
3-1 on Hobbit Atlas  Nazi
4-1 on Qrow and Maria
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hobbit Atlas Nazi XDD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Pretty accurate.
Matt (mattmyers25): What about Blake and yang?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Qrow is a bad bet cause heâ€™s been on the Death Flag Board for two seasons already.
Mark (Mad Doctor): They gonna live
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think Qrow will eventually die, but not this season
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Not at this rate no.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Heâ€™s got a character arc now for Ruby and Yang to resolve, about his drinking.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Shit, he's gonna die right after he sobers up
Mark (Mad Doctor): Or else fall under Winters watchful jurisdiction
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™ll guess the drinking will drive them apart and get him killed, heâ€™ll come back dramatically as a clean man to get killed saving the day, heâ€™ll sacrifice himself because heâ€™s better off dead anyway, or heâ€™ll get clean and survive the series on the bus with every other character RT canâ€™t link to the maidens.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Still waiting for RWBY automata and RWBYsona crossovers tbh.
