Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: so question
blake says his semblance is to absorb damage through his sword
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: my question is 
when adam was born or when he activated his semblance for the first time
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: did a sword just pop up out of nowhere? or did a sword he own suddenly become special?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: or like 
is it an object of his choosing? just with the specification that it has to be a meaningful object?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: or like only 1 object at a time?
Georgia (Something Sensible): pyrrha said that weapons are conduits for aura if not mistaken
Georgia (Something Sensible): he probably was thought to be semblence-less before he got his sword, or absorbed it like yang
Georgia (Something Sensible): and then he prob got his sword like " ............. whoa"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like Blake might have just been generalizing his semblance because it doesn't make sense for his semblance to be tied to an object. Maybe his sword is specially designed to absorb the kinetic energy and channel it to himself so he doesn't *have* to take the hits to dish the damage
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also leads to the question about Raven since she opens portals with her sword
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: see i figure raven can open portals whenever, but she's an extra fuck
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Well I remember Ruby saying in the beginning that weapons are an extension of ones self as well. Tying into what Pyrrha said, maybe sometimes people's semblances activate after "bonding" with their weapon?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): As Ozivander always said, *"The weapon chooses the hunter"*
Anna (Cadmium): or perhaps its more of a conduit and just helps focus the semblance. Like raven might have found her semblance but the sword being how she opens portals is probs how she does it so well. 
or like weiss uses her sword most of the time with her glyphs, but she did prove that she and winter can both use glyphs without needing the sword
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'd imagine the fantasy physics is he can redirect kinetic energy into either another object or himself. Then the object, or himself through an object, can expel that energy.
Mark (Mad Doctor): And that a signature weapon, crafted by the wilderness, would more easily channel the flow of aura tied to the semblance.
There's a lot about aura and semblances that remain unexplained on the show. I'm fine with that as long as they're consistent. Lived seeing Jaunes in action last week
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the link directly to the post doesnt work, but look at the first post on this tumblr:
https://rwby-hive.tumblr.com/
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they used monty's choreography for yang vs adam
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its so good
Jess (whoozica): ~~is that why its good?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~yea dude~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~this is bad, it means RT still doesn't know how to animate fights without him~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ok but im still glad they did it cause its a very important fight, im glad its good~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~leanna do u run this blog?~~
Jess (whoozica): with fren?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <.<
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): with wishcircuit
Jess (whoozica): ayyyy <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Mark (Mad Doctor): My guess is they viewed the fight choreography like a musical theme. Were meant to be reminded of the earlier encounter, but also to consider the differences
