snow ( karma chameleon ): I bet Argos is where pyrrhaâ€™s family lives.

Mark (Mad Doctor): Communication went down during the Vytal Festival and still has not been restored. What if Jaune has to tell them?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wtf mark
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I mean, it's a pretty common interpretation.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM SAD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The more interesting question are what are Pyrrha's parents like? Is Pyrrha's mom her tournament manager who never approved of Pyrrha going to Beacon; cold to Pyrrha and wanting her to continue the circuit and make money? Or did Pyrrha write home every night to her proud parents, telling her Mom about Jaune on wistful phone calls while her Dad encourages her to put down the sword every time they talk so that she 'can be a normal girl'?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Doubly sad if it's the latter

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Jaune stopping as RNJR walks past a town. Qrow says they can skip over this town, there's another in walking distance closer to Atlas. Jaune tells him Oscar and Ruby to go then, and they'll catch up. Ruby gets it suddenly, makes to join them. Jaune shakes his head sadly. 'I'm sorry Ruby, but this has to be from us.' Qrow puts his hand on Ruby's shoulder as Jaune walks into the town, head town while Ren and Nora trail after him, Nora nuzzled into Ren's side for comfort, and Ren with an arm wrapped around her shoulder, slightly clenching.
Erik (slendergiant): *~~better writing than Vol 5~~*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): thank you thank you.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But I'm terrible at actual writing.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~otherwise I have plenty of fanfics I could be writing~~
snow ( karma chameleon ): What also interests me is that in actual Argos, greece, there pyramids! I wonder if thatâ€™s where the random Sphinx grimm comes in or ( even tho neither mistral nor atlas is like Egypt )
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
