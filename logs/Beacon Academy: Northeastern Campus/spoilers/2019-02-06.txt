Anna (loud and likely blonde): Does. Tokoyami just. Sleep with the lights on
Anna (loud and likely blonde): How would he stop dark shadow going batshit if he had a nightmare
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tokoyami has night lights CONFIRMED
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I can't remember if it's canon or not but Uraraka has to deal with accidentally touching herself ( <:lenny:456549338026344489> ) at night and floating away.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Same thing with Bakugo, igniting himself overnight.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah if Bakugo gets the sleep sweats heâ€™s fucked
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Fuck I'm on episode 47 and. 
All for one showed up and like idk how to deal with this
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I am EMOTIONS
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Can you imagine Hizashi waking up having a nightmare
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Does mt lady ever accidentally giganticize
Anna (loud and likely blonde): How did she find out that was her quirk. 
Was it inside
Anna (loud and likely blonde): This is why fandom exists. To ask these questions
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yup! She wears mittens to sleep

Anna (loud and likely blonde): Does this villain really just have *daddy issues*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I can't. Too many emotions rn
Anna (loud and likely blonde): You can really pinpoint the moment my heart breaks in two every episode
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Idt I can finish the anime I think I have to just start reading the manga
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *boy told me to smoke the devil's lettuce to calm the emotions Marisa where is the police*
Marisa (Mawisa): *is someone offering you drugs 
Interpol is on their way remain calm*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): sometimes i think im not that obsessed with rwby but then i just had to explain the whole wizard of oz theory as to who is who to someone on fb and i realize maybe other people are just much less observant
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~he was asking how is Qrow the scarecrow from the wizard of oz. if nothing else his name is literally Qrow~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats a mood anna
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i cant start talking about the theory without going on a 3 hour long tangent
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): rwby panels at conventions physically hurt my soul because no one ever bring up this theory
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i end up holding myself back until the very end and then exploding information
Matt (mattmyers25): You should do a panel
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah like at geekdom :V
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...but maybe not smashed
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lets do a panel called "enthusiastic theory"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh no. smashed is best
Anna (loud and likely blonde): at least tipsy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i couldnt focus it was bad LMAO, tipsy is fine
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *Trashed Theory* the new panel ~~youtube series~~ where the hosts get drunk and start discussing theory with passion~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): like drunk history
Georgia (Something Sensible): but nerdier
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Drunk Theory
Anna (loud and likely blonde): RWBY edition
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): id be down
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we can do a Drunk Theory: Boku no hero academia if the first one goes off well
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof someone else can take on bnha
Anna (loud and likely blonde): honestly like. lets make a video series. just rants.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u think u alone.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh no
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Erik and meg frontrun that one
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEa LMAO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and marisa
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and ill be there to be like tHATS NOT HOW GENETICS WORKS
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i went to a 'thats not how physics works' panel it was GREAT
Anna (loud and likely blonde): GEORGIA I GOT AN IDEA FOR U
Georgia (Something Sensible): wat
Georgia (Something Sensible): OH DRUNK PHYSICS
Georgia (Something Sensible): only some physics could i probably do drunk
Georgia (Something Sensible): some of this shit is so stupid, you have to be sober
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we can write the real physics sober. rant about it while drunk
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *featuring clips from highschool of the dead*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): this is like how mag and i got drunk and criticized every medical inconsistency in Doctor Strange
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *WHICH IS ALL OF THEM*
Marisa (Mawisa): there's already a published paper on that
Marisa (Mawisa): here's a good one
Marisa (Mawisa): https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322530755_Analysis_and_Qualitative_Effects_of_Large_Breasts_on_Aerodynamic_Performance_and_Wake_of_a_Miss_Kobayashi's_Dragon_Maid_Character
Georgia (Something Sensible): OMFG
Georgia (Something Sensible): GOOD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Im dead
Anna (loud and likely blonde): georgia. we need to do this panel
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~im only 20~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~hit me up after july 29th~
Georgia (Something Sensible): OH COLOSSAL EAST
Anna (loud and likely blonde): LETS FUCKIN DO IT
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *this panel brought to you by the kalahari drinks*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~eighteen plus panels LEGGO~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): could as ginny too, shes a physics gal
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~which ginny do i know this one~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): msginnyliz on insta?
Georgia (Something Sensible): shes in this discord but i dont think shes online too often
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): O WOW her stuff is awesome
Georgia (Something Sensible): i believe the conclusion from the boob bullet dodging scene was that her boobs were moving close to the speed of sound
Anna (loud and likely blonde): YES THAT MATH
Anna (loud and likely blonde): faster than speed of sound
Georgia (Something Sensible): _there wouldve been a thunder clap from those bobbies_
Marisa (Mawisa): yeah it was over 8000 something flaps per minute
someone ran it through a sound simulator
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i will bring evidence from the anime boob physics panel i will be attending at toracon
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how did her boobs not like... tear off her body?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats a lot of force
Marisa (Mawisa): probably the adrenaline
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): top breast speed only 3080mph smh
Anna (loud and likely blonde): when we have to cite reddit
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): What a classic.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~if you ignore all of the ridiculous "the author used to draw porn and it shows" stuff, HotD is actually the best zombie anime out there~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They actually kill them, unlike Sankarea where he fucks them.
Marisa (Mawisa): ok but have you seen zombieland saga
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah honestly like. its actually a pretty good zombie anime
Marisa (Mawisa): https://66.media.tumblr.com/0fc4e92e2d5b1a173ef5e82541d7fb32/tumblr_phj6msCTiJ1vz5npso1_400.gif
Anna (loud and likely blonde): did it ever get continued or did it drop off the face of the earth
Marisa (Mawisa): nah it got cancelled
Georgia (Something Sensible): <@!289944569410224129> Iâ€™m already ahead of you
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): This is literally the topic Iâ€™m on in thermal now so I crunched the numbers
Georgia (Something Sensible): _plz send you stupid file_
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~someone pls watch zombieland saga~~
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PettyCooperativeAmethystgemclam-max-1mb.gif
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Marisa (Mawisa): the file uploaded!
Georgia (Something Sensible): todoroki would have to eat about a million pieces of cake to have enough energy to melt the ice
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~assuming my math is right~~
Marisa (Mawisa): what about sato whose quirk relies on sugar?
Georgia (Something Sensible): hes a wild card cause we dont have his metabolism rate
Marisa (Mawisa): time to send in fanmail and ask horikoshi
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so basically. he just funnels the most calorie dense food into his body constantly
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i mean this explains why everyone is so SKINNY
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wait what if hes like a giant energy battery <@!245270932602486784>  he uses ice most of the time right
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so hes gotta remove the heat what if he just. stockpiles it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): hes actually the only one who has any opportunity to be neutral on energy consumption
Georgia (Something Sensible): so more like a thermal battery?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): what about momo should have no boobs though if she makes lipids into items
like her boobs should be like camels humps
Anna (loud and likely blonde): YE
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like a thermal battery
Georgia (Something Sensible): possible, he would still need that outrageous amount of heat though
Anna (loud and likely blonde): toasty
Georgia (Something Sensible): unless maybe he draws it from the enviornment?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that would only work if he drew it from the environment at an earlier time
Anna (loud and likely blonde): or he would be freezing something as hes melting the ice right?
Georgia (Something Sensible): _he could be literally reducing the vibrational energy of atoms specifically to cool them off_
Georgia (Something Sensible): but that would fuck up the thermodynamics
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so he just steals the energy?
Marisa (Mawisa): what about fatgum
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Fatgum is a lieeee
Marisa (Mawisa): fatgum is my hero
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh my god wait . whats the math for how much energy it would take to fuse all the elements into nitroglycerin
Marisa (Mawisa): so many good cosplayers of him
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how much energy does bakugo use when he sweats
Georgia (Something Sensible): well im using the L= Q*m equation
Georgia (Something Sensible): Where L is the specific heat (which is intrinsic to a certain material), Q is the amount of heat needed for the reaction, and m is mass
Georgia (Something Sensible): so that doesnt help bakugos case
Anna (loud and likely blonde): So for bakugo I think we need to go into the amount of energy needed for water molecules to break their bonds and then the amount needed for them to bond with nitrogen
Georgia (Something Sensible): so boiling point of water?
