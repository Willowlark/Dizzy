snow ( karma chameleon ): LOL WELL NOW WE GOTTA
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Suppose it's of note this episode is the first to confirm Neo can talk.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This is the first time they acknowledged it.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Before the last episode it was kind of an… unspoken trait so to say 👉🏻👉🏻
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leave that to Erik.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I know it was bad but you set me up for it 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Proud of you Meghan 💕
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But yeah I noticed that they finally acknowledged her muteness
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Her model in the newer software looks great ~~but again, would have been neat to design a new outfit~~
Halim (Greg) (jake): ~~and the fucking green~~
~~is gross~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm speechless
Halim (Greg) (jake): like neo?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): are you talking about the eye shadow?
Halim (Greg) (jake): YES
Halim (Greg) (jake): WHY
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I mean, I don't hate it? But like, I don't get it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It *clearly* wasn't there before
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/a/a2/V2_11_00039.png/revision/latest?cb=20141023233054
Mark (Mad Doctor): Maybe a little pistachio in our Neopolitan
Halim (Greg) (jake): its not nice ™
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m usually all about cosplay makeup accuracy but when I cosplay the ice cream queen you can bet your ass I’m throwing that detail out the window
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): or else you'll scream?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): For ice cream
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was there in vol 3
Halim (Greg) (jake): the green was?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mhm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): on the aircraft with roman you can see it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its also a definining feature of all of her disguises
Halim (Greg) (jake): i'm looking at screenshots from the fight
Halim (Greg) (jake): where
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its green
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can see it its jsut reaaalllly faint
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wait for her to blink
Halim (Greg) (jake): that makes me more upset 
RT needs to calm their green bs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its minty
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It may be a limitation of the new models.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mint chocolate chip anyone?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Thanks
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I hate it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I still want to see see Neo designs in those other Turkey Hill Triopolitan flavors
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ESPECIALLY the minty one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): new art for me to draw
Erik (Red Riot Thot): because mint chocolate chip is bae
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Your team wasn't enough for you Tai?*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol Neo Triopolitan cosplay group when? XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ,... how old is Neo?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can't imagine her being more than 19.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not sure but definitely not a child
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah... maybe it's the anime in me, but I kinda expect her to be a teen.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Idk I feel like maybe early-mid 20s?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Roman doesn't seem that old either, early twenties. ~~He wears guyliner, he gotta be young~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thought that comes to mind is Neo is a Huntress in training who learned the hard way, via crime and fighting people to stay alive. So like, a foil to the ex school girls we call leads.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): neo refs for the eyeshadow ~~just so i can say i was right xD~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Halim (Greg) (jake): So I noticed that
It's way more pronounced when shes using black hair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/073/186/536.gif
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): sometimes I miss the old animations tbh.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i definitely do, specidically vol 3~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not for the quality, that horse is beaten to death and we all miss that. I mean how, while new animations have better facial control, the old ones can look less... floated?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like *everything* is rounded in the new animation model.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it looks... less ...bubbly???
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): less rounded? i guess
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yup.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Well at least we can discern Neo transformed from reg Neo now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i liked that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bubbly is a good word.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Someone compared Weiss in particular...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/a/a1/WeissV5Profile.png/revision/latest?cb=20180115225623
Georgia (Something Sensible): She just looks like an egg in the old one idk
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eh these are bad examples, but there are a lot more angles to Weiss's face in the old system. She has the same rounded look that everyone else does in the new one.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just didn't like how everyone's skin was blasted out white in the old animation
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok looking at these i think what i liked is the outlining
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The angled features were aristocratic, and she lost that part of her design.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh true.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the dark lining really did it for me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~also the arm joints in new system are fucking terrible~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I like the coloring in the new models better is I guess what I'm saying
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think a lot of the new animation would benefit from having that darker lining to them
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): while also having the better shading
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and facial features
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): In the rwby panel at rtx last year they stated that part of the reason it took so long to animate 1-3 was that dark lining so that was the first thing to go in the new animation style because it caused them so much trouble 😓 but I agree I think it added more to the design
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ ye its understandable why they dont have it anymore ~~but i still miss it D:~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It can be very defining. Look at BNHA, they had to bring it in from the manga in the later scenes to capture the art style.
