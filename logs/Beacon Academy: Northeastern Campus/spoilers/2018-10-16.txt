Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GUYS
Marisa (Weeb): first 12 seconds: "THE KRUSTY KRAB PIZZA. IS THE PIZZA. FOR YOU AND ME."
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😦 guess I know what I'm watching as soon as I'm out of class lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HNNNNNNNNNNNN IT LOOKS REally NICE
Erik (slendergiant): Wow, I love how you *know* it got leaked because it's still unlisted which means you can only see it if you have the link
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not super impressed...
Marisa (Weeb): it's unlisted for their paying rooster teeth members to view it early
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~whomst the fuck is on yangs bike~~
Marisa (Weeb): Katara of the water tribe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LmAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): basically
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Where is JNR in the snow scenes~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hmm.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just remembered how the volume 5 trailer only used scenes from the first episode.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wonder if that's the same here.
Jess (whoozica): hmmm my interest is peeked at least!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cause there's three distinct backdrops, the snow field, the mall(?), and then the train (which is super badass).
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So they're really moving if that's all first episode.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cross your fingers
Erik (slendergiant): ~~all of JNR gets killed on the train~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~Episode One~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~Written and Directed by Miles Luna~~
Jess (whoozica): Ren yeeting Nora off the train 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i would laugh honestly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like its not out of the question at this point
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so it would just be hilarious
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > JNR: "Help...!"
> Ruby: ...
> JNR: "We're going to die!"
> Ruby: "Sorry, RT is too cheap to pay for a fight scene here"
> JNR: "naniiiii"
> JNR: *Dies*
> Ruby: "N.... nooooo...ooo?"
> Ruby: *Blinks*
> Ruby: "Okay, I'm over it."
> Yang: "What's the plan Ruby?"
> Ruby: "Make sure no one else dies."
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Volume 6, you heard it here first.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM FUCKING LAUGHING SO HARD
Marisa (Weeb): ~~also describe miraculous ladybug~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~not gonna say id prob stop watching buuuttt... id prob stop watching~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I want to say I'd stop...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): but I guess I want to watch it crash and burn at that point?
Jess (whoozica): youll never stop XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I dunno, doing that would alienate the fanbase even more.
Marisa (Weeb): are we talking rwby or miraculous
Marisa (Weeb): miraculous i assume
Jess (whoozica): i don watch that
Marisa (Weeb): i watched style queen today and got like 2 minutes into the episode after that then stopped
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): JNR dies falling off the train:

First take: *Ruby screams, activates silver eyes, and watches the grimm around her burn to death as her friends get smaller and smaller until they hit the ground, dead on impact. There's a full minute cut of Ruby crying, Yang punching the roof the train in, Blake backing away, resisting the urge to run away, Weiss struggling to be strong for everyone else.*
RT: No, do it like we talked about.
Second Take: "What's the plan Ruby?"
"Make sure no one else dies."
Georgia (Something Sensible): why is there what looks like a fallen snowboarder on yangs bike lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats katara, georgia
Erik (slendergiant): The way that the line is written "Make sure no one else dies" implies that someone recently died. Howmstever, the way everyone in that shot is acting indicates that the person who died either died long enough ago that they'd have time to accept it, or wasn't an important character.
Marisa (Weeb): i bet katara dies
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~That's pilot boi, they saved him~~
Jess (whoozica): or maybe all the people at that mall died
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Correct Erik, which is why I think it's HILARIOUS to put that line after JNR's death.
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): catch jaune BLOCKING AGAINST NOTHING
Georgia (Something Sensible): and nora shooting the grimm IN THE FACE
Georgia (Something Sensible): classic team JNPR
snow ( karma chameleon ): 
snow ( karma chameleon ): ICE FLOWER TEAM ATTACK?!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is this GAY
snow ( karma chameleon ): IS THIS A GAY
Casey (Raining_Jellyfish): I LOVE IT!!!!
Marisa (Weeb): oh that makes a LOT more sense than "fantastic beasts and where to find them 2 looks great"
snow ( karma chameleon ): AHHHHHHH
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): i wonder who this lady with her stylish servants is
Jess (whoozica): whos mans is dis
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m excited for emerald to have more plot too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Generic bandits 5, 9, 12.
Georgia (Something Sensible): theyre too stylin tho
Marisa (Weeb): glynda has gained some weight
snow ( karma chameleon ): it’s atlas
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Someone will cosplay theright and left one.
snow ( karma chameleon ): KNFJSKDNDKSNDKS
Jess (whoozica): this just looks like uncle crow is taking the girls on a shopping spree
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): STOP MAWISA
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that main bandit lady reminds me of this
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy6j2LUyh24
Marisa (Weeb): isn't that the lady from fire emblem though
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm unimpressed with the new Weiss outfit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): "new" air quotes but.
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): wow guys ren and nora will be relevant again
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~until they die~~
snow ( karma chameleon ): Rip
Georgia (Something Sensible): ok she says "dont let anyone else die" like she doesnt actually care so its probably some randos on the train
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~seriously though if it ends up just being RWBY Oscar and Qrow I'mma be salty~~
Jess (whoozica): lets be honest one of them dying would be waaaay more angsty
snow ( karma chameleon ): Rubys done with this shit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~implying RT can write angsty scenes~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They spend way too much time on characters only to ignore them. No Sun, and fuck *that* noise.
Marisa (Weeb): oh maybe sun dies
snow ( karma chameleon ): Nah
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nah he just leaves
snow ( karma chameleon ): him and ilia go away
Georgia (Something Sensible): the actual sun dies
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~unless he and Ilya get a spin off where they take down the White Fang all while they argue about how hot Blake is~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): the fight the rest of the series under the moon
Georgia (Something Sensible): plot twists everywhere
Erik (slendergiant): So I was looking at this shot and it reminds me of Deathly Hallows when Voldemort and Harry are flying around and whatnot. The red one is clearly Ruby based on past experience but it looks like there is someone with a white cloak and maybe the same semblance? Maybe some sort of Summer Rose appearance?
snow ( karma chameleon ): pretty sure it’s weiss?
snow ( karma chameleon ): that there looks like a team attack
Marisa (Weeb): someone waifux2 the screenshot
brb
snow ( karma chameleon ): that’s two gays making a supreme gay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~if we get whiterose attack, give me bees too pls~~
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’d assume we will get bees?
snow ( karma chameleon ): they got shit to work thru first
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): bees or riot
Georgia (Something Sensible): weiss and ruby team attack, ren and nora team attack, bumblebee team attack, jaune somewhere else, crying about his dead gf
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Implying RT can write shipping~~
Jess (whoozica): im actual otp trash cuz ive watched this 2 second clip of ren yeeting nora like 3 times and my heart do a lil happy each time
snow ( karma chameleon ): ME WITH WHITE ROSE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jaune "team attacking" by blocking the air ~~ghost~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): jaune stares into space
snow ( karma chameleon ): jaune throwing Oscar so he can be useful
Georgia (Something Sensible): what a good boi
Georgia (Something Sensible): OMG
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oscar is just riding the train
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): listening to music
snow ( karma chameleon ): the part where Oscar falls lmfao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
snow ( karma chameleon ): But like
snow ( karma chameleon ): Where the fuck is penny rt
Marisa (Weeb): waifu x2 very little help
Georgia (Something Sensible): is that little silver part at the bottom of the  white, near the black, is that weiss' crown?
Marisa (Weeb): that's what i was thinking 🤔
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shes got her scarf
Marisa (Weeb): OH yeah I can kind of see weiss's face
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m so gay
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m ready
snow ( karma chameleon ): SOMEONE PLS WHITE ROSE SHOOT?!?!!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): just two cloaks swooshing together
snow ( karma chameleon ): if Weiss got a white cloak like summer, I would fucking die
Marisa (Weeb): red part is the scarf, her head is below/left of it and then her hair
snow ( karma chameleon ): AHHHHHHH ICE FLOWER
Erik (slendergiant): I see RT put all their budget into background scenery and tree animation
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): 
Jess (whoozica): ITS LIKE THE WALL IN SEASON 5 EP 1
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): full budget on trees. sorry guys fighting will happen next season we promise
Jess (whoozica): they waste the whole budget on the first scene of each season its tradition now
Jess (whoozica): ngl my first thought was "Skyrim, but with rwby"
Mak (hollyjollymak): I'm hype for it!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh shit same jess
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://66.media.tumblr.com/c45228a75e8dfed23da947e8b576bcf3/tumblr_pgp7iwE8OO1rkcev7o5_400.gif
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): for your *needs* <@!351471675843411978>
Jess (whoozica): YAS LOOK AT THEM. Beautiful
Erik (slendergiant): I see we get a Kylo Ren-esque temper tantrum from Adam as well
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats normal for him
Marisa (Weeb): That’s zuko
Marisa (Weeb): This is just the new season of Avatar
Erik (slendergiant): And the relic shrunk significantly
Georgia (Something Sensible): rubys new semblence shrinks shit for plot reasons
Georgia (Something Sensible): i would try to argue that her speed can change things size, because physics, but if she flew really fast with the relic it would acually get bigger
Erik (slendergiant): Like look how big it is when Yang retrieves it
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/334/525/6f4.png
Georgia (Something Sensible): yangs just really tiny
Georgia (Something Sensible): totally
Georgia (Something Sensible): _RT sweats nervously_
Jess (whoozica): thats the new relic pro, all the power, half the size
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): new sword shape?????????
Georgia (Something Sensible): _banana sword_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Probably mid transform.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): him cool
Jess (whoozica): wow cant believe nora gets a tine pet grimm this season
Marisa (Weeb): solgaleo / lunala fusion pokemon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *~~If we distract them with new Grimm, maybe they won’t notice us removing JNR from the show~~*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jnr is in the trainer enough thooooough i doubt they will remove them
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like they actually seem relevent
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m excited for atlas bc s n o w
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I didn't see anything that was *really* indicative of a better season but...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What the hell.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Need the RWBY Hype train again,
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mood
Mark (Mad Doctor): OK, just saw it. Art and animation looks like another jump forward, which I like.  As for writing...well, I'm expecting the same as Volume 5, but there's always a chance that RT learns from their mistakes.  I will choose to be optimistic.
And, Bill, they have an ACTUAL TRAIN. I'm hype.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its a little concerning that oscar falls and does grabby hands towards the relic >.>
Marisa (Weeb): I do the grabby hands at the “ozpin is evil” theory
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YeaaaaAAAAHHHH, the Train could be an EPIC scene.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ozpins the final boss
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im sticking to that theory
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Animation looks better, but we only saw clips. That could be the only minute of good animation in the whole series. 😅
ZombieHunter: SCREEEEEEEEEE
ZombieHunter: it’s really good from what I saw at NYCC
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): blakes hair in the adam trailer was bae
Mark (Mad Doctor): So were her ears
Georgia (Something Sensible): why does weiss get leggings but blake still has a crop top
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): PFFT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): mood
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~god when did I start speaking like this~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Blake has to lie on a laptop to get warm
Erik (slendergiant): On Yang's lap top
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The leggings are meh design. as is Scarf.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I expected a brighter red.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wonder if anyone's even going to ask her why she got a scarf?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i expected a bigger scarf
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that ya know...covers her exposed skin
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Blake, still wearing a crop top.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You can't even say she's used to it, her home country is probably RWBY Australia.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, how are they gonna explain this one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~photoshop the scarf to be a red flannel~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "aura keeps us warm"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~wezrez spotted~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > "Aura keeps us fed"
> "Aura cuts our fingernails"
> "Aura does our math homework"
> "Aura writes out dialogue"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~"aura paused the plot after volume 3"~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): small detail, but you can see whos luggage is which in the trailer
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): except the top brown
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it cute
Georgia (Something Sensible): but the white case is weiss and yang has a duffel
Georgia (Something Sensible): so cute
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Available on the RTX store in 2019, for more than you should have to pay.
ZombieHunter: Okay but
ZombieHunter: Leanna and Georgia will buy it anyway
ZombieHunter: 😂😂😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i most certainly wont
Georgia (Something Sensible): i will MAKE IT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
ZombieHunter: I hate you both
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:blockyhands:484798627752181761>
Georgia (Something Sensible): i would rather slave for 30 hours with a sewing machine and fabric paint than buy, lets be real
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof same
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay finally got to watch it!
1. How are they not freezing in snow with skin still exposed?!
2. Kylo Ren/sumo melt down from Adam... yea good 😂

Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Old lady in tbe trailer is a maiden
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Thoughts on the idea?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everyone's a fucking maiden.
Georgia (Something Sensible): RT store be like
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if she is then we can count on her being the dead one
ZombieHunter: Qrow is the prettiest maiden
Erik (slendergiant): LMFAO
ZombieHunter: Thank you
Erik (slendergiant): The RT store thing is accurate AF
ZombieHunter: I love the valid react
Georgia (Something Sensible): the truth hurts
ZombieHunter: Georgia no
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So the "this is simply the truth" line
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So salem destroyed everything adam was working for yes  
Cause thats the only person i could think it applies to other than emerald, or maybe cinder, assuming she let cinder die and was warnjng emerald
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): (Letting cinder die causd of her ambitions and repeated failure)
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Don't let anyone else die..."
Who is missing in that scene who might be death-flagged?
Ren and Nora 😫 
Oscar
Jaune
PILOT BOI!!!
Georgia (Something Sensible): if jaune dies i just give up /shrug
Georgia (Something Sensible): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~at least then arkos would be together OOF~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): though theres that theory that all of JNPR is destined to die
Georgia (Something Sensible): PUN INTENDED
Mark (Mad Doctor): They could be big misty heads in the sky like Mufasa
Matt (mattmyers25): Arkos will be dust in the wind
Matt (mattmyers25): Rwby May become game of thrones. And you die, and you die. Everyone dies
Erik (slendergiant): ~~Jaune gets burned to death and dies like his namesake~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Volume 8 Preview: The cold wind whistling through the uninhabited ruins of Remnant
Matt (mattmyers25): Winter is a coming
Mark (Mad Doctor): Nah, but she is excited to see Qrow

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://twitter.com/TheMilesLuna/status/1050179866103095297
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Hahahahahaha
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ren's last words: "See? I told you that swinging you in circles atop an icy moving train was a bad idea..."
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Alright so I watched the trailer for vol 6 and it LOOKS like a lot is going to happen, but it seems very serious and a little dry. I hope they didn’t sacrifice any of the light hearted humor
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I think that old lady is gonna give some high quality hermit lady comedy
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I sure as hell hope so
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Like gimmie a sassy old lady who hits ppl with her cane
snow ( karma chameleon ): Oh hell yes
snow ( karma chameleon ): So is emerald the maiden
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): who knows
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is cinder dead dead
Jess (whoozica): plot twist: there are no maidens
Mark (Mad Doctor): Only lanterns.  The lanterns have been plotting the downfall of Remnant this whole time
snow ( karma chameleon ): plot twist: the old lady is neo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO LISTEN ID BE HYPE OK
