Erik (Red Riot Thot): so the Adam x Port cell was nearby and the fucking name is FREE EDGAR and I'm screaming xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): which is a reference to Port's VA, Ryan Haywood's, obsession with capturing a cow in Minecraft and putting him in a hole in the ground with a glass top
Marisa (Mawisa): :you don't understand. edgar is the one in the hole."
Marisa (Mawisa): has anyone ever seen 12 little roosters

Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7ABSsu-ACM
Marisa (Mawisa): aww it cuts out the part where the cow keeps going back in and then keeps running into a cactus
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lol yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Michael's efforts to actually get Edgar away from Ryan's house was like, at least another 5 minutes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just need everyone to know that the Neo x Yang x Blake OT3 is called *Neopollination*
you want fucking rwby chibi?: @here i have a theory on how pyrrha could still come back
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://giphy.com/gifs/oACFYaf7KE1eo
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): OwO whats this
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You’ve perked my interest, do go on 👀
you want fucking rwby chibi?: what if sometime in the future in rwby they Do call the god brothers back, what if they could bargain for pyrrhas life to get her back
like salem and ozpin finally being all "we truly fucked up and we know now and are sorry now (or something) please bring back this child that was wrongly killed in our fued" and the gods go hmmmmmmmmmmmm. mayhaps so. because pyrrha did nothing wrong and deserves life
you want fucking rwby chibi?: law of equivalent exchange!
Georgia (Something Sensible): “Bring back the child wrongly killed in our feud”
Georgia (Something Sensible): The gods be like _which one bitches_
you want fucking rwby chibi?: im going on the hope that penny will come back in a not-god-induced way because she is an android
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👀 equivalent exchange oh yess please
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but, not to burst bubbles, but ..." you must learn the worth of life and death"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if they can just bring her back... then is there really any worth to death
you want fucking rwby chibi?: shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhits pyrrha
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ok valid, we'll make an exception for her~~
ZombieHunter: 
ZombieHunter: >.>
ZombieHunter: it's a meme AND a spoiler
ZombieHunter: yay
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Tbh I like Eberus if you know the mythos behind the name 

Also if you're a dirty Persona fan like me
