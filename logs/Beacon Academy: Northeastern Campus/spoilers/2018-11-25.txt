Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh another thing I noticed, Yang went out without her tails on and when they went to the shed, she suddendly had them?
snow ( karma chameleon ): Neo always has green eyeshadow right
snow ( karma chameleon ): had
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yes it was just more faint
snow ( karma chameleon ): IM NOT CRAZY
snow ( karma chameleon ): THANK U
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It's also the one feature that remains the same between her different disguises if I recall correctly
snow ( karma chameleon ): I feel like ur right?
snow ( karma chameleon ): It’s been so LONG
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof my heart breaking in two too. I was like ahh my babiessss 😫💕

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Brunswick. Torchwick*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is it just me, or would a Cinder/Neo buddy road trip episode be fun to watch?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She just rides her shoulders and Cinder’s like “Why did I agree to this...”
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I also saw that theory and omg if that is Roman’s original family I’m gonna s o b
Evie (Katheryne Knight): LOOK AT MY FUCKING B E A N
Matt (mattmyers25): She is scared
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s so funny. Chris was yelling at me at work about the new episode and how I’ll scream
Then Rob messages me in all caps “GEN. YOU NEED TO WATCH RWBY”
Then Kelsey messages me the SAME THING. 
All I kept thinking was “Please no Qrow death please no Qrow death” 
Instead I was greeted by MY SECOND FAVORITE CHARACTER BEING A B A D A S S
Evie (Katheryne Knight): S h e 
B a c k
Evie (Katheryne Knight): There’s hope
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If she came back Winter might come back next season.
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m 200% hoping that lil family is torchwicks
Mark (Mad Doctor): I hope the smol one is Roman
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~the big one is Roman~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): If it's Roman, you're right, <@184437198865563648> . Given that the corpses closely resembled two of the adults in the picture, it's a fairly recent picture. If the child is Roman's son, then add a tragic backstory to Vale's favorite gangster
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): if there's *any* tie to Roman it's going to be a humanizing factor.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not that the fandom doesn't already *love* Roman.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ok. Crazy hypothesis: the thing in the basement is Roman's kid. Later found and adopted by Neo.  Fandom goes wild!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that'd be... crazy, yes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I hope Neo doesn't just sign on with "Cinder's Troupe of Troubled Youth". She's too much fun for that, and is better suited as an independent entity or an anti hero.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm 80% sure that the thing in the basement is a survivor rather than the monster. We've gone a whole episode without exposition
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Maria: "*I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A BED TIME STORY, IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT*"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Qrow: "Step aside, grandma. This is my turf. And do I smell a wine cellar?"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everyone else: *Trying desperately to sneak into the evil cellar to avoid exposition fest 2018*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Weiss: How bad can freezing to death be?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oscar: Um, guys? Ozpin says he's sorry and will give us vital information if I let him come back.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Everyone: NO!!!!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yang: "Okay Blake, I'll forgive you in a heartbeat if you can ninja us out of this exposition scene"
Yang: "Blake?"
Yang: *Taps Blake*
Blake: *is a shadow clone*
Yang: "OH YOU BITCH"
Yang: "Never leaving again huh?"
Mark (Mad Doctor): 😆   On a more serious note, I thought Weiss' trick with the candles was one of the nicer uses of semblance we have seen
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Maria, after 465 minutes: "And that's the story of macguffin"
Qrow: "ACTUALLY I heard that story differently, let me explain"
Ruby: "Uncle Qrow, there's a bar downstairs"
Qrow: *Nyoom*
Weiss: "RUBY!"
Ruby: "Did you *really* want to hear another version of that story?"
Weiss: "..."
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WEISS PULLING SOME DUMBLEDORE DELUMINATOR SHIT WAS AMAZING
Mark (Mad Doctor): Salem: Everyone thinks of me as the bad guy. You know why? BECAUSE I KEEP MY GODDAM BACKSTORY TO MYSELF! While you're busy with exposition, I'm fucking getting things done!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ozpin: "There's a reason I have to do that, let me explain"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~someone tumblr savvy make an incorrect quotes tumblr and post these~~
