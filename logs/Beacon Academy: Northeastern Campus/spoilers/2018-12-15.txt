Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This is the house episode we should have had in atlas.
Matt (mattmyers25): I liked this episode
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Banter, bits of exposition in real conversation, *character conflicts*, emotions....
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No Winter. Gen will be upset
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah and the atlas guards were kinda lame
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think they were supposed to bring an element of comic relief but eh??
Georgia (Something Sensible): good exposition tho, between team JNR reacting to the news of ozpin and the silver eyed info
Mark (Mad Doctor): I will do whatever it takes to make Pissed Off Nora feel better.
The Atlesian commander was good, and her bits with Maria and Nora were comic gold, but yeah, those over the top guards were...eh.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ren: I think it would be best if we had some time for ourselves _Follows Nora into a Room_
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao I literally just watched that part and thought the same thing Georgia XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): reddit seems to be split 50/50 on whether or not it really is ozpins fault that pyrrha died
Georgia (Something Sensible): the answer of that question being whether or not jaunes anger is justified
Rebecca (madameterralupus): "So how do I laser beam monsters with my eyeballs" XDD OMG
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~I'm pretty sure ren and nora were both following jaune into a ropm~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~even better~~
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~team jnpr has always actually been a group orgy~~
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~pyrrha just died before jaunes sexual awakening~~
Matt (mattmyers25): So that was the semblance that she unlocked
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Hes got a lot of it <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~BDE~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): semblence is big dick energy CONFIRMED
Erik (Red Riot Thot): His semblance is aura amplification which basically is a stamina boost which means they can go longer
Georgia (Something Sensible): erik you somehow made jaune arc 10 times sexier
Georgia (Something Sensible): and for that, i thank you
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~Jaune never has to worry about his partner running out of stamina~~
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~cause if they get tired he just shares his stamina~~

Matt (mattmyers25): !lewd
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~and since he has an absurdly large amount in comparison to most~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): To be honest I'm actually really glad it wasn't Winter after reading the synopsis
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also really hoping for a moment of Ruby losing her shit on Qrow cause he needs to get his shit together 

Like I love him but he needs to get his shit together
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also side note, if Winter doesn't step on that racist strawberry short cake I'll be disappointed XD
Jess (whoozica): GOOD STUFF
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~or sheâ€™s actually racist and it takes Weiss saying sheâ€™d choose to be a better person over the racist her sister wants her to be for Winter to realize the errors of her ways~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Did jaune seriously just put a crack in his sisters wall, what an asshole ðŸ˜±
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He needs some lesson from his mother about channeling his anger XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Perhaps seeing his sister in a happy domestic situation made his sense of loss return
