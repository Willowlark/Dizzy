Marisa (Weeb): so in the bnha movie
kirishima and bakugo are rooming together on i island and decided to go there together for whatever reason ~~all of class A gets there one way or another and it's a big coincidence they all meet up~~
maria invites them to go to a fancy party and bakugo is like "i ain't going, rawr." kirishima eventually persuades him. Bakugo doesn't have any formal clothes and (i can't remember too well if he puts something on that looks awful or if he just keeps complaining he doesn't have anything but basically) kirishima is like "don't worry bro I packed a suit for you you'll look great in it"
