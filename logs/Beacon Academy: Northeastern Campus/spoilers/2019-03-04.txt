Mark (Mad Doctor): Perhaps Chase knows something? But Erik noted that her avatar was listed as "Awaiting User Login" (scroll up for his screencap). Still not conclusive proof one way or another, and I think Momma Chase's determination when she learned of the attack suggests she had an escape plan
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ye
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: also looking at that shot, it doesn't look like it applies specifically to her, it looks like its part of the background wall
Mark (Mad Doctor): RT should have toyed with us by rendering her character as a black silhouette
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: nah, I prefer this cause it's still short enough to miss, but clear enough for conjecture
that way when it comes back later we don't feel dumb for not noticing like with OG Chase bot
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hm, I wonder if, since Union Chase and the GL team share the same network, the real combat will occur not on the physical plane for within their headspace. Memories jogged and consciences pricked, and that stuff
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Rainbow boi and rom are ex boyfriends #cannon
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: CALLED IT
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: TWINKY TOP AND MANLY BUFF BOT
