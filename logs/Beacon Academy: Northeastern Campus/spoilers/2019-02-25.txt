Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Hey uh
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Just a comment on the PTSD thing 
While I dont think she has it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Or she might honestly it depends on how rt deals with it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Her having PTSD based on that experience is 100% legitimate
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Regardless of whether or not she woke up whole (unlike yang without her arm)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Cause PTSD is purely psychological and has to do more with the perceived threat to your life or self
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Not the actual physical harm
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Like thats why people who are bullied and threatened can get PTSD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Without ever actually being attacked
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And having your head ripped off (and yes for her in that moment it was like having her actual head ripped off)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Is 100% good enough to trigger it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And while I dont think RT put any focus on it in this episode, that doesnt mean it wont come back later
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Like I dont trust RT to give her a proper one at all, and i dont think they want to delve into it as PTSD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: But like 
It's not the same for everyone and the way yang's PTSD exists is completely different from hers
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh yea fam, I didnt mean for it to sound like only physical stuff can cause PTSD. But ditto to everything you said
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Lot of good points. And I really hope they do bring it back as apposed to just forgetting it ever happened
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I also really dont rhink they botched gangs PTSD, while we're talking about it. 

Vol 4 was a little DICEY, but they definitely portrayed an accurate form of PTSD for yang in vol5-6.

I dont think yangs entire character should have to literally become PTSD incarnate for people to think its "good enough" representation, because quite frankly that's not the case for a lot of people with PTSD. It doesn't have to take over your entire life. It shouldnt be the main focus of yangs story, or cammies for that matter. 

While it is a big thing, they handled it well for yang. I just hope they do the same, or even better for Cammie
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Ye 
Ngl when I think of cammies situation I think her PTSD assuming she has it is being handled perfectly fine
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea I agree, as long as it does come back again... like basically as long as the show doesnt forget completely that her mechs head got ripped off, and never bring it up. But I think they will bring it back up. I have faith in that at least
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Shes an active combatant in a war 
A soldier 
Even with PTSD shes going to keep fighting, and the only real thing that would probably trigger an attack is Chase 1.0
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And shes only actively ran into him once since the event
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And the only reason it worked out was cause of the mindmeld with val
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Who wouldnt have ptsd
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: So like 
When somebody literally can enter your mind and give you a touchstone it makes sense youd be more capable of dealing with that trauma
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I also think with her in some ways literal form of disassociation in the Holon, some of her PTSD symptoms wouldnt be as apparent
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's actually a little early to diagnose Cammie with PTSD since she is still very much experiencing trauma first hand. She is a prime candidate for it, though, as she was plunged into violent and terrifying situations with no real preparation.  
As Hal mentioned, The ways the show has suggested to deal with psychological issues (and I might add the personality sliders Cammie experimented with) are part of the "potential" I described that keeps me coming back. Please don't disappoint me, RT
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Yeah
tbh I feel like genlock is literally just a raw brick of potential
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: like literally everything it needs to be good is there
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: it just
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: is only sitting there
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and not necessarily doing anything
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yep
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: it gives me a feeling of RT wanting to make big moves while also really trying to play it safe
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: which makes sense when it is looking to try and be there first form of like
Legit TV style animation programming
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its hurting it
