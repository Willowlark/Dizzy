Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm down
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I wanna do original ozma in his cute armor .. sort of >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~That boy is a twink~~ I can pull it off
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I'm Bryan from Starbucks and Leanna is Jimothy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Exactly
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): Miss Salem? I don't feel too good...
you want fucking rwby chibi?: omg
Halim (Greg): Should I do cloud city district or whatever then
Halim (Greg): GUYS
Halim (Greg): SEMBLANCDS
Halim (Greg): HOW DID HUMANITY GAIN ACCESS TO THEM
Halim (Greg): If the lore is right, humanity lost all magic and could only use dust in its stead
Halim (Greg): BUT we know people have semblance and such which are basically very specific magic variants
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Theory: semblances are remnants of magic passed on from the decendents of Salem/Ozma's kids mixed with non-magic blood
Halim (Greg): That's what I was thinking
Halim (Greg): I think aura (unlike semblances) is what humans had in them that powers their magic 
But only with the magic blood of salem/ozma could they actually gain access to using it as a semblance
Halim (Greg): ~~guys no wonder ozpin cares so much about all his studdnts~~
Halim (Greg): ~~they're all basically his great great many times great grandchildren~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That would kind of explain how your semblance isn't activated until someone after your aura is unlocked (isn't that what Pyrrha did to Jaune? I could be misremembering)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What is aura
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can't recall if anyone here mentioned it lol BUT I was listening to CRWBY whilst folding laundry and they mentioned we've see Jinn before in Vol 5. At first I was like hmm but then immediately was like oh! She's the statue to the vault~ ðŸ˜¯
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also: Ellie goes "I would love to see cosplays" Referring to Jinn. Ohh girl just you wait they'll come lol~! ðŸ˜Ž
Halim (Greg): Aura is the remnant of salem's immortality
Halim (Greg): (Refer to how after attaining immortality Salem gets the aura glow around her)
Mark (Mad Doctor): We also saw Dust appear in the market right after Remnant's fall in all the solrs we saw magic manifest in. Fragments of the moon, perhaps? Or fossilized human magic that is now used to power tech and semblances?
Halim (Greg): So yall
Halim (Greg): Ozpins first reincarnation is the one that's voiced by Shannon (IE Ozpin) 
Not Ozma
Halim (Greg): And by the looks of it, it seems that when Ozpin reincarnated, only 1 soul is reincarnating 
Like its implied the souls never merge during life, and only Ozma is told that he must reincarnated and stuff
Halim (Greg): So why is it Ozpins mental voice is the same as Reincarnation 1, and not Ozma himself
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ¤” interesting thought, thinking back you're right it is Reincarnation 1's voice and not Ozma's voice. I wonder if we'll ever get an answer. ~~maybe I can throw it out there as a tweet for CRWBY or something and see if anyone answers~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"You must learn the importance of life and death. Only then may you rest"*
That's definitely going to come into play somehow in defeating Salem
Halim (Greg): ~~so I'm lowkey highkey excited~~
~~for when they finally beat salem~~
~~and she passes on and is like 'thanks for finally ending it'~~ 
~~and ozpin also passes on finally leaving Oscars body cause his mission is also done~~
Halim (Greg): ~~and we see the two of them move on to the afterlife after meeting up in the place between realms~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Although one thing I'm confused on is that they wiped out humanity, then send Ozma back and humanity is suddenly there again?
Halim (Greg): God reminds him that humanity is bound to return (like evolutionary)
Halim (Greg): So theres actually a really really huge time skip there
Halim (Greg): Like millions and millions of years
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah, they don't do a great job emphasizing it though
