Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thereâ€™s a Goose pop figure.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just saw the film. If Goose does not get his own film, I'll be sad. I agree that she is way OP compared to almost everyone in the Marvel Universe, so sending her away was a reasonable way to deal with the Supermarket dilemma ("Why do you need a Batman in the Justice League when Supes can do everything?"). Loved the characterization of Danvers and I loved every moment Nick Fury was on screen
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Young Nick Fury is amazing.
Mark (Mad Doctor): And a well-played use of the F-bomb allowed by the PG-13 rating
