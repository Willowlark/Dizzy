Erik (Red Riot Thot): People need to stop trying to defend Adam because it's seriously pissing me off
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Saammme. I went off but in a polite way to the one dude who's post we were talking about a bit ago.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ethan was trying to make the argument that Blake and Yang are murderers because Adam was unarmed and I'm just like asdkjsdhfglkdfsna.d,mvnsdfkj.ghsdf;oghd.nv. NO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): YIKES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ethan no... no no.. 😩
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If they had not killed him. He would have ended up killing one of them. Or both... soo
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Exactly. Killing him was the only way to ensure that he wouldn't kill them. It's not like they *wanted* to kill him. You can even see how distressed Blake is after she does it. But when you're in that situation with all that adrenaline rushing, you're only going to be focusing on ensuring you're not getting killed. There's no stopping to try to detain him. He's not going to back down so your only option is to defend yourself by all means necessary, even if it means killing him
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: lol nice edit erik xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, the fact that we feel so strongly about this proves how great of a villain he was, but don't start victimizing him
Jamie (Jamie): ~~i feel like the adam sympathizers are also the same ones getting butt hurt over the gilette cm~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh dear

Anna (Cadmium): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> <:leanna_pyrrha_scream:514147026741624887>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Protect Nora at ALL costs
Matt (mattmyers25): But the trend is only 1 redhead has died in a volume, Nora is safe for another 3 volumes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Pyrrha, Penny, and Roman all died in Vol 3...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol you right. Oof
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Protection circle for Nora. QUICK <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Vol 3 was butal!
Matt (mattmyers25): She will yeet into the grimm
Matt (mattmyers25): Or get destroyed attack on titan style
Rebecca (madameterralupus): No. She wil be protected. She MUST not die
Jess (whoozica): *nora, about to die*
"wait just do you know, i dye my hair"
*instant heal*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *-form a protection circle around Nora, Neon, and Fox-*
Jess (whoozica): "wait so you couldnt afford food as a kid but you could afford hair dye?"
Nora: "priorities <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>  "
Anna (Cadmium): im making a bunch of pins/bracelets/stickers that say "dead redhead squad" on them and handing them out at cons now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Give one to every dead red head cosplayer lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *-hands one to a Pyrrha cosplayer that hasn't finished Volume 3 yet-*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "Wait, what?"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~fox was already killed by being put on the bus~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i refuse to accept penny is dead dead~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): She's a robot. She can be rebuilt. They *have* the technology
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm just afraid of what would happen to her memories and personality if they do
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Bring her back as a giant mech XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they uploaded her personality and memories to the cloud
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): give us back penny
Matt (mattmyers25): Last episode of the volume turns into an episode of darling. Penny becomes a mech and together with the atlas mech, defeat the grimm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Atlas mech: Speakers crackle
Everyone: owo
Maria: Cusses about racism hobbit's mother
Mech: arms raises
Everyone: oh shit brace for impact
Mech: arm to forehead
Mech: "Salutations"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *shit I just moved myself*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~pls no more mechs~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Penny as a recurring character in Gen:Lock
Anna (Cadmium): penny's death hurt me most of all tbh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ same
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hard to be more pure than Pyrrha, but then...Penny
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```The destroyed character model of Penny from "PvP" and "Battle of Beacon" was actually built by her voice actor, Taylor McNee, who is also a 3D artist on the show.```
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
Erik (Red Riot Thot): modeling your own corpse
Anna (Cadmium): like. Pyrrha knew she was going into a fight that she couldn't win. Penny just wanted to have fun.
Anna (Cadmium): she didnt know what happened.
Anna (Cadmium): *thats why it hurt me so much*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what kills me about the penny scene is that even as shes realizing shes dying ... like you can just tell she doesnt blame pyrrha
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): penny was so pure
Matt (mattmyers25): But we got to see how 4 quarters come from 1 penny
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): :C
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i didnt want to
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thanks david blane, PUT HER BACK TOGETHER
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://giphy.com/gifs/stupid-david-blaine-ke7eaxvM1QqNa
Mark (Mad Doctor): Possible final episode reveals that Neath is concealing:
1) Jaune finally works up the courage to ask Pyrrha's statue out.
2) Qrow accidentally chokes to death after he drinks spring water by mistake
3) Ren drops the F-bomb for no good reason
4) Maria reveals that she is in fact Summer. And Raven. And Kali. And Momma Schnee.
5) Just for the hell of it, Salem builds a Death Star
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so...actual theory
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the fleet of flying grimm looks eerily close to the flying monkey scene in wizard of oz
Mark (Mad Doctor): No! Not "your little dog, too!"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in which they attack the group and kidnap dorothy and toto to take to the wicked witch
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and the witch tries to remove
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the slippers
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀
Matt (mattmyers25): So Casey Lee wrote the melody that played during salem's back story episode

Matt (mattmyers25): <@334090409389195266> does this mean Salem can be defeated with water? Lol
