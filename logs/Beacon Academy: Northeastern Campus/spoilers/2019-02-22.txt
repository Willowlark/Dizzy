Erik (Red Riot Thot): Anyone have theories about the union mech?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm not sure yet
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: It seems to know the weak point of the genlock mecha
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It spoke to them as if it knew them
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~it exists so genlock canâ€™t curbstomb through the entire Union army~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: So I'm guessing it's based off of an old genlock design that got union modded?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Can't be too Gen:locky since the Union was trying to steal the tech in Ep 2
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Well if you compare the two mechas it's clearly more durable and weaponized, but nowhere near as agile and capable
If I were to guess it's got a weaker brain system and it traps the user in it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Recall the guy who was going to steal tech didnt realize you needed a special brain and was planning on leaving his body behind
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: At least if it is like a union old variant
Mark (Mad Doctor): So the Union mech has squishy meat bits?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hm, perhaps Yas' defection helped Weller's own ideas?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Why would it tell Cammie "You haven't shut up since your birthday"? ðŸ¤”
Mark (Mad Doctor): "2nd birthday"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Another agent in the Anvil?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Which leads me to believe it's controlled by someone who was there when she first uploaded
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Hmmm true
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: It could be another spy
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Which would explain its knowledge of weaknesses
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And why it shows up where they go
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's that fuckin' Gilbert and Sullivan hologram, isn't it?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~lowkey was thinking that~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Shit that makes sense
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's always the light opera types...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wanted to see if "Let the good times roll" had any relation to G&S but I don't think so
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Especially since the union seems to very easily hack bots
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I mean he gave him Hamilton at the end of that one episode
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Dr. Weller a Cars fan maybe? ðŸ˜…
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): There's also Valiban, Weller's Android. But I hope not. I'm getting an adorable Gromit vibe from him

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Did anyone watch dragon prince season 2? Cause damn if RWBY could be done by them... They have villains firmly placed in shades of grey, not 'muhahaha lamp', character conflict and drama that isn't cut off after three lines of dialogue, world intrigue, 'meaningless' character moments which make the characters feel like real people that care about one another, ample time for the cast, *romantic gestures beyond holding hands*...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like, I binged it last night and I did not intend to.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it *is* made by the ATLA creators after all
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need to get around to watching that. Seems good.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Same. Love the character designs I've seen
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it is very good, the first seasons animation style was a bit jarring, but season 2 they seem to have streamlined it a little more and the story has gotten really compelling too! I definitely recommend it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): season 1 wasn't anything special, but I love s2. And the animation bump is perfect.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Claudia is best girl~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): || Even if she killed bambi ||
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I just love loving Soren and Claudia as much as the heroes. Like. WAY to make characters that really connect to the audience.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Veren too, even if he can talk alot.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): soren is my favorite character, to literally no ones surprise
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Soren isn't a bee~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hes blonde and angry
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oh tru.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also a dork
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Just.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Dumber than Bakugo and Yang.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, dumb boi, hes precious
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Very.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oof. I want them || to tell Veren to fuck off and join the heroes || but at the same time. || The family isn't great, but the three still all care about each other and that's also a pretty pure emotion. ||

Man I hate when everything is grey. I *love it*.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its so good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but to... frustrating
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its incredible
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): exactly. I'm just hardcore into every choice they make cause they're *human* and make mistakes, and I understand why they do what they do and somehow support them even if they're a mess.
