Erik (Red Riot Thot): RIP Bryan from Starbuck
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): From the reddit thread on the status chart. 

Team ORNJ? Don’t like the idea of Oscar leading but.
Marisa (Mawisa): Will Smith looks horrible as the Genie for Aladdin oh no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh no show pics
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Really? I didn't think so 😮
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): I didn’t see the video yet just this still. Does he look better in motion?
Marisa (Mawisa): It’s gonna take some getting used to at least
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh geez
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's some quality NOPE
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was honestly hoping he wouldn't be blue...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Just like, normal Will Smith
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But a genie
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, Oscar's last name is Pine. Could still be JNPR
Georgia (Something Sensible): he looks more like lost member of blue man group than genie
Mark (Mad Doctor): Needs more bloobies
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Am... I the only one who thinks it could be worse.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like it's not great, but also what were we expecting. It's not like Marvel is making Aladdin XD (I know Disney owns them, but I don't think its the same studio doing the CGI)

I'm reserving judgement for when I actually watch the movie in theaters.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is Blake the least popular member of RWBY? Blake cosplayers are pretty rare which is why I was thinking it. Though Blake get more gender bending too.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Really? I feel I've see Blake cosplayers a lot  😮
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Really? I always see everyone but weiss
Anna (loud and likely blonde): weiss seems to be the least popular cosplay character at least of the main 4, every meetup she's always the one with the fewest. We legit got more Flynt cosplayers than weiss cosplayers at ANYC this past year
Georgia (Something Sensible): I second that
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think it’s cause a couple people buy the cosplays, and I’ve seen some atrocious Weiss cosplays for sale
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like one was gray when it should’ve been blue
Georgia (Something Sensible): So it takes a little more effort to find a good one
Anna (loud and likely blonde): also like the comittment to have the leggy out all day is hard
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~which is nothing compared to Pyrrha cause they don’t even sell a good Pyrrha cosplay~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yike
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ponytail wig is annoying too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah I feel like Weiss is underrepresented
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also Ruby sometimes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): then again half the yang cosplays for sale i see are missing severe details of the outfit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Maybe I just follow too many bees cosplayers lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): weiss and ruby i think are like. i dont wanna wear a skirt all day
Anna (loud and likely blonde): although i see so very few weiss cosplayers and have only ever seen one genderbend weiss whereas all the rest of the characters get bent
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *ahem*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "combat skirt"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah Weiss is like, the least genderbent
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yang is definitely the most popular character though
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think Brandon is the only full Weiss GB I've seen
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh absolutely
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yea i was about to say
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): brandons weiss was pretty fucking cool
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:gay_heart:378261402089160705>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeeaaa I see fewer Weiss and Ruby's. Brandon is deff the only full GB Weiss I've seen aside from Zitchy's swim Weiss at CCE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i just realized anext was the first time i met tyler and brandon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah and Zitchy's was literally thrown together last minute xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.instagram.com/p/BVSyxxFjIUi/
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's a youuu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): his SHOES though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): big yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): highly impressed, need more GB weiss
Erik (Red Riot Thot): agreed
Rebecca (madameterralupus): More GB cosplays in general plz! I love themmm
Erik (Red Riot Thot): From what I've seen, the breakdown of GB cosplays goes Yang > Blake > Ruby > Weiss
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👆🏻 yee
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah i only know like 1 GB ruby cosplayer
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Actually, I think I may have seen more Blakes than Yangs
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm excited to put together my V2 GB Blake. Leggings should be coming in today
Anna (loud and likely blonde): are you guys doing a V2 group at Zenkai?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): no, I just wanted to do the V2 outfit lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~the answer is always yes~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): o lol i was gonna say i have the V2 yang if anyone needs it for a group
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i might wanna borrow that at some point 👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): idk about zenkai but.... at some point
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ye fine by me. I have a sad pair of compressed ember celica too if u want lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hell yeah fam i never made any ember celicas
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'll take what i can get xD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i have a template somewhere lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): _V2 Weiss hngh_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Anna is doing that outfit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Snowpea is cute.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i love snowpea so much honestly imma do that for like. a cold convention
Jess (whoozica): ~~whats snowpea?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): did u mean. the best outfit weiss ever had
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it kinda is though.
Jess (whoozica): ~~when does she wear this?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): v2.
Jess (whoozica): ~~i have shit memory~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): aka, the season they spent in their school uniforms the most
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i bought a used V2 yang off tokiimokii on instagram like over the summer and honestly it fits like a glove
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): V2 had the "huntress" outfits which were just like. Different for some reason.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They dropped the outfit changing in v3.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Then they updated the outfits again with the new models.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah idk like they were cool outfits just. not really their personality really. 
actually it was definitely like the outfits you wear when you go home from school for break and are like 'im cooler than you'
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but like yang is just all titty out and no tummy out
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yangs outfit could slay me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean. Huntress!Yang covers more than v1 or v4.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Blake just looks like she went to the gym instead of fancy rwby clothing stores. I never liked huntress Ruby.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ruby just looks like she skipped laundry day
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but like yang, fighting in a miniskirt is NOT AS EASY AS SHE MAKES IT LOOK I ALMOST FLASHED SO MANY PPL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yang easily coulve replaced her mini skirt with booty shorts and called it a day
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): had to be fucking extra
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Weiss went to like. Saks Fifth ave, ruby skipped laundry day, blake went to the gym, yang went to the club
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's pretty much volume 2 in a nutshell, if we're being honest.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~u right~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Blake's honestly looks like weird pajamas
Anna (loud and likely blonde): blake looks like shes into athleisure
Anna (loud and likely blonde): those are blatantly nike track pants
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I really want to do Yangs v2 outfit. I love the aesthetic of it. Not a fan of the mini skirt ~~but that cleavage though~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Literally these: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KW6XD7G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Anna (loud and likely blonde): literally those yoga pants tho
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~which are the ones I ordered~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Anette if u wanna borrow mine to see how its constructed lmk
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Ohh thank you, I'll let you know if I need to when I figure out what con to make it for.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Also Blake's PJs look like she raided Kali sexy lingerie closet but it fits like a regular robe on her
Anna (loud and likely blonde): also like where tf does yangs purple scarf thing attach to her. it just kinda looks like its magically hovering
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it's attached by the power of love for blake
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Tucked into her boot? Sown on the stocking?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think it's attached to her belt
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea it is
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/c/c1/V2_03_00017.png/revision/latest?cb=20151124094350
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the hangy blet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): belt*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/8/87/Freezerburn.png/revision/latest?cb=20140904045002
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): covered by that flappy boi
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/f/f2/V2_04_00073.png/revision/latest?cb=20140814233046
Anna (loud and likely blonde): those are all like subtly different positions
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): That makes a lot more sense lol
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): It's a pretty stupid scarf thing
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i honestly need to just remake the sock bits
Anna (loud and likely blonde): cause i have like. kneepads and then the top of the sock thing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I never realized her boots had bows and that's so freaking cute
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Right? Like it's my favorite Yang outfit. V4 - 6 is a close second.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~its a bitch to wear~~
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~I bet~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~its too cute tho~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): pointless belts tho dont like to stay up
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I like that is shows that fun flirty side of her.  We don't really get to see that as much now. I want the Yangst to be over next volume.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Let Yang recover 2K19
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Bring back the puns. Let Barb go ham.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): god i was rewatching the first couple seasons and. it hurts so much to watch how happy and carefree she was. how everyone was.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its like watching the first season of game of thrones
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Right? Although I do like Ruby has matured a lot.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): after seeing where everyone is now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh same, she needed to mature honestly xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): everyone's come so far
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ruby and Yang have matured and Weiss and Blake have opened up more
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): My body is ready for more Weiss character development next volume.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): weiss opened up and yang closed up.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~god yes pls~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): let weiss say fuck you to her dad
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~Is it bad I want Monochrome to happen just so we get to seeing Jacques aghast at his daughter making out with a faunus?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats honestly a mood and im like the biggest bee shipper on the planet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i just want jacques  to see it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~poly rwby just like poly strq~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk i think. yang would let weiss kiss her girlfriend just to piss of jacques
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): probably lmao
Mark (Mad Doctor): I hear Ilya is single these days...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Some people ran with that ship.
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Daddy issues"?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): "Useless Lesbians", according the reddit chart.
