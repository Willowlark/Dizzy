Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ready for Adam to die? OwO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I am
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Please
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/386560899265200139/536187067831549962/image0.jpg
Matt (mattmyers25): Today is a good day to die
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Well, Leannaâ€™s basically dead.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm CRYING uncontrollably
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Goodbye world
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm dead
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You canâ€™t die yet.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Bees havenâ€™t been Facebook official yet.
Anna (Cadmium): BRUH
Anna (Cadmium): HOLY FUCK
Matt (mattmyers25): Leanna is dead
Anna (Cadmium): So is someone else
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The symbolism of that whole scene I'm a fucking sobbing mess right now
Anna (Cadmium): I just need to watch yang say gotcha on repeat for eternity pls
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I cant stop crying
Anna (Cadmium): Fucking
Anna (Cadmium): Yes
Anna (Cadmium): He went over the cliff fuck yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Blake said she wont break her promise and yang said SHE KNOWS
Anna (Cadmium): BUT NOW EVERYONES AURA IS DEPLETED AND A GRIMM ARMY IS SHOWING UP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I WANT TO DIE THATS ALL I WANT IN A RELATIONSHIP
Anna (Cadmium): bruh like just kiss. Please
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FUCK ME UP ROOSTERTEETH
Anna (Cadmium): Honestly
Anna (Cadmium): But also honestly FUCK YEAH YES YANG YOU ARE SMARTER
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Wow I need to watch again because I was screaming through sobs the entire last half
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I would die for yang
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also blake
Anna (Cadmium): RT putting yangs fear into that scene was important
Anna (Cadmium): Shes fighting even though she's scared
Anna (Cadmium): And still unsure of herself but she's there
Anna (Cadmium): And. Now we can sing. 
DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD
Matt (mattmyers25): And the grimm Godzilla shows up
ZombieHunter: LEANNA
Anna (Cadmium): Or is there a song from beauty and the beast about killing the monster I forgot about
ZombieHunter: Vc please
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, they had some good emotion spots. Iâ€™d have liked more to the arc than 3 episodes. Itâ€™s quality stuff.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Hopefully Neo can pick up the slack as the badass duel foe.
Anna (Cadmium): Leanna has no voice from screaming good luck
ZombieHunter: <@!334090409389195266>
ZombieHunter: VC
Anna (Cadmium): AAAAAAA troy is in the middle of the ep I can't scream yet
Anna (Cadmium): <@184437198865563648> I would've liked more than 3 also but on the other hand like. I would have been mad if they dragged it out
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They could have run this as a full subplot over a season and thatâ€™d be legit.
Anna (Cadmium): Or like two solid episodes instead of cutting left and right
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'M ACTUALLY CRYING HOLY SHIT
Anna (Cadmium): I'm so proud of yang tho for not wildly using her semblance
Anna (Cadmium): Baby has improved so much
Anna (Cadmium): Fuck why couldn't this be last week so we could have a dead Adam party
ZombieHunter: I need a long talk pls
Anna (Cadmium): I'm having my own dead Adam party
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I gotta go bitch about the light kit that came with. *no. Bulbs.*
Anna (Cadmium): Go forth bill. Go forth and bitch
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Someone keep Leanna from a heart attack.
Matt (mattmyers25): Go check on her someone
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They *both* skewered him with the two broken pieces of Gambol Shroud ðŸ˜­
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I love them
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm fucking sobbing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I cant stop crying??????
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This episode really murdered me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I have like no voice from screaming too like wow roosterteeth came for my fucking life today
Anna (Cadmium): ~~it came for Adams too~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FUCKING GOOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Butch needed to die
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Bitch needed to die
Anna (Cadmium): My cat is looking at me weird cause I just have been YELLING
Anna (Cadmium): Dis bitch woke me up at 7 he can deal with it
Georgia (Something Sensible): LEANNA I WAS LITERALLY
Georgia (Something Sensible): THINKING THE SAME THING
Georgia (Something Sensible): did anyone hear that cronch as Adam fell
Georgia (Something Sensible): The bitch definitely ded
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEA HES DEAD DEAD NOT LIKE CINDER DEAD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FUCK YESSSSS
Anna (Cadmium): He DEDDDDDDD like he dead before he fell off the cliff
Anna (Cadmium): The rest was just insurance
Erik (Red Riot Thot): â˜‘ stabbed twice through vital organs
â˜‘ hits cliff face HARD, probably shattering a lot of bones
â˜‘ falls into a river where his lungs will fill with water
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He DED
Anna (Cadmium): And this was after he got a full punch to the face by yang so everything he threw at her was thrown back at him so.
TODAY I AM MARKING IN MY CALENDAR AS DEAD ADAM DAY
Anna (Cadmium): But also. This makes three dead redheads
Erik (Red Riot Thot): AND AFTER HE GOT REKT BY A MOTORCYCLE TO THE FACE
Georgia (Something Sensible): *four
Georgia (Something Sensible): Now five
Georgia (Something Sensible): Penny, Pyrrha, Roman
Georgia (Something Sensible): Iâ€™m blanking when I just remembered a second ago
Georgia (Something Sensible): And now Adam
Georgia (Something Sensible): Maybe itâ€™s just four?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hurt sure summer rose
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *blessed*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Blake Naruto running
Jess (whoozica): My fav part was when Adam was like "oh" before he fell off that cliff. 

"Oh, this isn't the kind of sandwich I wanted to be in"
Jess (whoozica): All Adams die by sword sandwich it law
Mark (Mad Doctor): Twenty years from now: "So what was your first date like?"
"Well, it was at a romantic spot by a waterfall, and we murdered a crazy stalker bitch who deserved to die."
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): React to spit on his grave
Matt (mattmyers25): Why do I have a feeling ruby will use her silver eyes next week
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Definitely. I have a feeling this is going to be the reason they're going leave JNR behind in Argus while everyone else goes to Atlas post fight.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): JNR just decided on their resolve to keep fighting Salem. If they stay behind Iâ€™m calling bullshit.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I hope I'm wrong. But it's a nagging feeling. They have so many times to Argus it's not even funny.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Final scene has crew boarding an airship with Atlesian blessing. Final shot is on the pink and brown eyes of the pilot...
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Also can we form a Nora protection squad? RT just killed another redhead.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Nora shaves her head for next Volume...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): :Lenny y:
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): So Nora just becomes Furiosa? I'm down.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hey, Thor got a haircut in Ragnarok. Why not Nora?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://twitter.com/LippyGiraffe/status/1086692735917142019?s=19
Erik (Red Riot Thot): An Adam sympathizer just asked me if it was wrong that he cried when Adam died and I flat out told him yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ew.....good tell him how it is
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Shame weâ€™ll never know the story to the brand tho.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm sure we will
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): They are going to atlas after all
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Schnee dust company
Mark (Mad Doctor): We may get that in Atlas if the SDC treatment of faunus gets played up
Mark (Mad Doctor): If the letters had been reversed, Adams scar might be explained away by contact with a hot piece of equipment. As is, it's clearly a brand. That fact bumps Jacques up from "major dickhead" to "evil bastard"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Inb4 Weiss and Winter stab him at the same time.
Mark (Mad Doctor): With the broken shards of Penny 2.0
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OOF
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~In a suspiciously similar fight sequence where Jacques is suddenly a master of quick draw Japanese swordsmanship~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): His moustache is also a gun
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): erik you should draw that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm just imagining Jacques as King Bradley from FMA
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~except Jacques is a weak piece of shit and probably doesn't even know how to use a weapon~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): I BEG YOUR PARDON?!?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): PFFT
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'll take that too.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But definitely not a fighter.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): How will RWBY deal with an enemy they can't behead?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Unless cowardice is weaponized
Mark (Mad Doctor): Odds that we'll meet Weiss' mom?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I had some kind of theory about momma Schnee but I forget it...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Your ~~mother~~ princess is ~~drinking in~~ another ~~mansion~~ castle.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I already ship her with Qrow. They can be rehab partners
Tom (tomukuncosplay): The only thing I was disappointed about when Adam died was that rooster teeth could have made him better
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): His arc could have been longer and way scarier ~~than Cinder could ever be~~.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~am i the only one who was tired of all the white fang , stalker ex bf shit and is happy that its finally over in such a powerful way?~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oh yeah the white fang was boring lmao
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Although the cinder and Adam pm stand on the same moral ground
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Both are pure evil with no redeemable traits
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): White Fang was incredibly boring. Adam's impact in the narrative as whole was lessened because of how boring.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I would have liked today's sequence to have followed more closely on the defeat of the white fang at the end of the last Volume.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): There was a disconnect yeah
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, i really thought this whole thing was going to wrap up last volume
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but then when adam got away i was dissapointed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but they did it well this volume
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I hope yang gets happy again after this ðŸ‘Œ
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Depressed yang bums me out
Mark (Mad Doctor): They did make it clear in the last two eps that Adam had crossed into pure evil
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yup. Adam crossed the moral event horizon in season 3.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): He was never getting redeemed.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): (Technically; he probably crossed that line before the series started, by being abusive to Blake. But as we don't see that in our narrative it doesn't quite count)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont think yang will ever be vol 1-2 happy, shes grown from that, but i can totally see her being less serious all the time
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Although I will mourn the only male character that fought cool in the series.. oof. I hope Qrow and Ren step it up soon <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): YUP
Erik (Red Riot Thot): She's matured *a lot* since Volume 3
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): And hopefully Neo will step into the role of 'villain who fights the protagonists; rather than schemes on a evil island'.
Mark (Mad Doctor): He could have grown from his defeat last season. RT could have played up the pain in his past. Instead, they made it clear we should not feel bad about him getting yeeted
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ good on them
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah I thought he was going to go a different route after he escaped last season... Until he murdered everyone in white fang hq
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, anyone else changing their minds about the Argus soldier we thought was Neo? She made a reappearance today and I'm pretty sure she's not Neo now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): as for yang, the traume isnt just going to go away because adams dead. So id say, don't expect happy jokey yang  anytime soon, but the biggest part of her issue was faced and conquered so we might get a softer yang
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yup. This is a better finale than "arrested in Haven" for the arc, but it's also not the full extent they could have used Adam's character.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Speaking of which I get the feeling the only red head coming back is Roman. (And penny cuz she can be rebuilt)
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ye Adam dead dead. If they pull the 'resurrected as a grimm' card I'm done.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they wont
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): his ark is done
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Adam hits em with the this isn't even my final form card
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they have no reason to bring him back
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Roman when tho. He *always* had a backup plan, that's his thing. He needed a way out from Cinder's thumb, and death is a great way to do it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Salem rez's him just for the boss rush in the castle in the last season.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Please tho I miss Roman
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like he was such a GOOD VILLAIN and LIKEABLE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But at the same time that might defeat the purpose of Neo coming back
Mark (Mad Doctor): Indeed.  Vol 1-3 Neo was pretty simple. Now, I can honestly say i don't know where her arc will take her. 
Would like to see more Merc and Emerald this season, too, though that seems unlikely
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I think neo might be on her way to redemption but Miles and Kerry said she's gonna do something the fandom will hate her for so I highly doubt redemption will be her thing
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Neo's the wild card. She serves her own interests only.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's why she's fun.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Maria has a few death flags. Nobody better touch my salty old cashew
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'll be pissed if Neo follows Cinder around listening like Emerald 2.0.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She won't that's not like Neo. Only person she cared about is Torchwick and he's gone.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She obviously feels a bit threatened by Cinder but I feel she'll join her until she doesn't want yo anymore
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ruby's speech in front of the Mecha was pretty good, but it didn't move the Murder Hobbit. But I'm not sure how deep Neo's hatred runs. Can she be moved by our earnest heroine?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cordovian was slightly moved but her head is so far up the militaries ass that she makes Winter look like she gives less of a shit
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah, she went full villain mode today. Can't imagine ironwood would approve
Anna (Cadmium): If there's a massive front of Grimm showing up. They probs have to call reinforcements. Maybe winter show up?
Mark (Mad Doctor): TBH I thought ironwood and winter were the blip on the radar at the start. Maybe they will be the cavalry at the end of the finale
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Can we also touch on Ren's adorable and excited "Guys! ðŸ˜ƒ " when he sees Jaune and Nora?
Jess (whoozica): Yes plz thank you
Jess (whoozica): Absolutely adorable
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I posted my Yang analysis on Tumblr a couple hours ago and it already got 145 notes holy shit O.o
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just watched the episode and HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIIIIIITTTT
Mark (Mad Doctor): Agreed. Well said.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Last week, they could have pulled some "and that's how Blake and Yang discovered the true meaning of teamwork" shit. But after today there's no going back
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So when I do Fem! Adam I expect Leanna and a Blake (Snow?) to re-enact his death for a photo with me PLZ ðŸ˜‚
Mark (Mad Doctor): I envision a cce shoot where Gambol shroud is replaced with pool noodles
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Had talked about that with Leanna awhile back~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Umm sign me the fuck up for that PLZ~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm always down
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Fuck adam lives
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Going off what Mark said about Ironwood coming in. I would honestly love that because episode 1, Qrow sends a letter giving him the update and says "there's a good chance we'll get [to Atlas] before this letter does". They took a pretty long detour to get to Argus so maybe Ironwood got worried and, knowing Argus would be their only way of getting there, sent forces to get them. Then seeing the massive grimm attack bringing along reinforcements to take them out. It would be a really good development in Ironwood's chatacter that he got his shit together and strengthened his military (but like, in a logical and tactical way) to redeem himself from the Grimm attack on Beacon. It'd be a really nice parallel
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I've never met an Adam cosplayer whose not a creep, it'll obviously wait for you~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ooh. Shame about that. I'd love to see someone do the full branded face.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Bionic Cosplayer and lexilee  excepted. They're both sweethearts
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't think I've met them, but I'd believe it. Just seems to be a trend that Adam cosplayers are excentric.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I really want to do the branded face.I just gotta get better at makeup lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah, as a general rule I agree
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Whole season has been pralleling V3 (v3 Ruby uses her eyes the first time, V6 she learns about them; V3 Bees v Adam and losing, V6 Bees v Adam and winning; a big grimm attack for both volumes) so having the Atlas military coming in to redeem themselves I think would be a nice touch
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~so where's the major character death~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea I think you're right erik
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....well
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Heres the thing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): You're al forgetting EVERYONES aura is depleted
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Except for qrow
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oscar
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Maria(?)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And ren(?)
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *OH Qrow is going to sacrifice himself and entrust the mission to Ruby*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Blake's weapon is broken
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The giant robot is immobile
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And theres a huge fleet of grimm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So ... someone is going to get hurt or die
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~Taiyang and Raven to the rescue please~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Was today the seasons finale or is it next week?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~Team _TRQ battle~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That would tai in the after credit scene
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I would be down for that
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So non Bees for a hot second... Has Aura mechanics gotten more confusing to anyone else?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Next week rebecca
Anna (Cadmium): Do I need to help u do brand makeup rebecca lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol plzzzz ^
Anna (Cadmium): Yeah why does aura look like borderlands shields now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I think they just changed how it looks to better show what aura is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It's a shield of sorts
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's protects them
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't mean the look and feel, I mean the 'when you lose it' thing.
Anna (Cadmium): Wym
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Jaune has the ability to give more aura to others
Anna (Cadmium): I always thought it was like when u run out you're basically drained of mana
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Aura was always kinda bullshitty, but now it seems way more variable.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): When its depleted they are essentially like normal people in our world. If something hits them they will get hurt, there is no shield
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Jaune has 'massive aura reserves' (<:lenny:456549338026344489>), but he hit a rock once in that fight and no Aura.
Anna (Cadmium): It's like wow they finally have some physics to it though
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like, I'm not getting a consistent sense of people's aura capacity.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It seems different every fight.
Anna (Cadmium): I think it also has something to do about being conscious about it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Idk... seems pretty consistent to me
Anna (Cadmium): Like maybe jaune can bypass his own
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I *want* that consistent sense as well, because if I'm able to see their aura fading, I know the fight's stakes for injury go up.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The aura SHOWS when its fading or about to go out
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It doesnt show before that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And
Anna (Cadmium): Like Weiss is pretty conscious about how much aura she has most consistently of the girls I think
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): When they use their semblance that makes it go down super fast
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't think semblance has ever been canonically confirmed to reduce Aura.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It has though. That's why weiss is on the floor in this episode
Anna (Cadmium): Not cannon but I think it's correlated
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): She used her glyphs to slow Ruby's fall
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And it exhausted her and shes out of aura
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So she falls to the ground
Anna (Cadmium): And when you run out of aura your semblance isnt able to be used I think. 
Remember glynda cleaning up after beacon
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ruby uses her semblance to get out of the canon
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Cannon
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~escape canon~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): She also gets hit with retaliation
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It depletes her aura that she used it twice so quickly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Which is why she couldnt just zoom up the wall last episode
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yang is out of aura after releasing her semblance on adam, which is why the yellow shows when her hair turns back to normal
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Essentially. If you have played amity arena... their semblance and aura works like the cooldown times
Mark (Mad Doctor): Aura has always been a vague mechanic.  I remember getting frustrated trying to quantify it it when I wrote the rwby rpg
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yup.
Anna (Cadmium): To be fair they still haven't explained where aura comes from so like. HELLO LORE PLS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): True
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I played on a rp board a year ago, the entire board just handwaved it as 'whatever you feel like'.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Still need that
Anna (Cadmium): Give me just an essay on the mechanics of aura and dust and shit
Anna (Cadmium): Don't write it into the show just update your wiki pages
Mark (Mad Doctor): Aura in rwby is like tech in Star trek. It's whatever the plot needs it to be
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Well... for that.. I dont think everyone has the same amount of aura. It would be silly to assume everyone has the same amount
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Everyone is different
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Jaune has more because his semblance is enhancing other people aura with his own
Anna (Cadmium): I'm curious if yang has less now
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It IS essentially a powered shield, that absorbs X amount of damage.
Anna (Cadmium): And if ironwood has like half of what he should
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Idk... it makes sense to me, but I guess it hasnt really been explained
Anna (Cadmium): If you lose parts of your body do you lose your aura reserves?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): **How the finale *should* go**
Everyone's pretty much fucked. Grimm are attacking from everywhere and only those few handful of people are able to fight. Oscar at some point unlocks his semblance and performs some badassery. Maria decides she's got one kat fight in her and whips out a mini scythe and does some master Yoda shit, redeeming herself from feeling useless in her old age.  A portal opens and out walk Raven and Taiyang, wielding his badass weapon. _TRQ fight against grimm ensues and it's awesome. Raven is "redeemed" by coming back, probably dies sacrificing herself to protect a beat up Yang, passing maiden powers onto her. Taiyang is redeemed from being a shut-in and there's an awesome Tai/Yang daddy/daughter fight against grimm while Ruby and Qrow fight side-by-side. JNR is also there. Things are going great until they're not and then fleet of Atlas ships headed by Ironwood and Winter swoop in to save the day.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Probably a little bit
Anna (Cadmium): And then half of them get arrested
Mark (Mad Doctor): RT has gone out of it's way to NOT explain it. It go no mention in the World of Remnant shorts way back when
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): that's some serious wish fulfillment buddy.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It is lmao but I'd still be down for tai to come
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like please give us gratification for that after credits scene....
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Jeez
Erik (Red Riot Thot): RIGHT
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): **Taiyang's actual role in the finale**
> Post credits
> Patch
> Pan from sky onto cottage
> Taiyang opens front door
> Bird flies out
> Taiyang grimaces at bird
> Taiyang sighs
> End
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WHAT WAS THE POINT OF IT IF IT DOESN'T TAI INTO THE PLOT SOMEHOW
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Nah I really feel like there had to be a point to that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like things from back in vol 1 and 2 that we though had no point ended up having a LOT of point to them all the way in vol 6
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So ... I really dont think they would use that scene for nothing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But if Tai manages to make his way into this volume during the finale, watch me die like Leanna did with bees
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'll also die
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So it will be mutual death
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's always the sunflowers...whom you least suspect...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Bury us next to eachother
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~well, you're father daughter so~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): If winter comes gen will die too so shes also welcome to join the burial
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Well have like a ceremonial burial where one of you can put os on a wooden raft and set it on fire
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They've built up a really great volume so if they finish it off le that I don't even care if it's fanservice
Mark (Mad Doctor): Given that we're still discussing an episode that dropped seven hours ago, I'd say this Volume was a success
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yup. They've come a long way.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If they can manage to get all the fighting up to the Adam duel tier; we're golden.
Mark (Mad Doctor): And Vikki ng funeral sounds like another cce shoot ifea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@386874959009415170> viking burial at cce if tai shows up?
Anna (Cadmium): I'll bring the fire
Anna (Cadmium): No I won't. But. I'll bring pool noodles
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YES
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Excellent
Jess (whoozica): I completely lost track of this chat but that ok
Georgia (Something Sensible): I died with that Pyrrhaâ€™s mom scene so
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hi welcome to dead
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HI. Wanna be viking buried at CCE???
Georgia (Something Sensible): Of course
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): EXCELLENT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): DEAD MEMBERS OF BNE SQUAD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: "viking buried"
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: oxymoron
Georgia (Something Sensible): I want it in the main wave pool to inconvenience as many people as possible
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SHHHH
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH SAME but also I kinda want it in that big tube that just shoots people out like a sink
Georgia (Something Sensible): I would also like a kalahari cup to be placed in my hand
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like directly down
Georgia (Something Sensible): In memorial of the cup I never got
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we can arrange that
Georgia (Something Sensible): The wave pool would frankly make our Viking ships capsize
Georgia (Something Sensible): We need to rethink this strategy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Well be dead so
