Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eeeeeh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): EeeeeeeeeeeEEEHHHHHH
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The power of friendship saves the day.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And they didn’t SAY what they were doing other than “we’re taking miles Luna and not going to Anvil” and that annoys me to shit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nemesis is kicking their ass up until “with our powers combined” and once they do Nemesis just. Stops trying? Definitely looked like that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There’s a stinger, FYI.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also “the doc made us immune to nano tech” is like. Such an asspull.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And on a less salty note, how EXACTLY does their hologram tech work. There’s no projector. No microphones. No speakers.
Mark (Mad Doctor): OK, I thought it was a good episode, though I'm salty you beat me to the Captain Planet references. We learned a lot about the Gen:Lock tech, and it was presented in an organic way that did not require the usual RT expo dump.  The fight scene was probably the best in the series.    Even when all five mechs were going, we were aware of how each was contributing to the action. Oum-era RWBY stuff.  Glad to have the Anvil crew remain, even if they had to pull the Weller ex Machina to do it.  

1) Miranda is the biggest badass on the show
2) She better not find out that the first person Chase asked about was the Doctor
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I feel like the fighting was two one sided fights, rather than a fight with give and take. When it started Nemesis was unstoppable, then they captain planet'd and Nemesis stopped fighting back to their attacks.
