Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "please just give up on me in case I die"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof it still hurts tho
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont like seeing brienne cry
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that was so painful
Jamie (Jamie): yea that hurt and jasons bro also made the comment after of "they killed his arc" but honestly he about to go commit some murder of his kin because she a mad bitch
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they did no such thing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nikolai himself said hes "happy with the ending" and him going back to cersei is not something hed be happy about
Jamie (Jamie): on the arya tho i am much happy seeing her and hound going off to adventure once more to kill some assholes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH SAME
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ARYA AND HER FOUND FAMILY DAD
Jamie (Jamie): yea no i think they chose words very carefully during that after show when it concerned jaime since one slip will be spoiler technically
Jamie (Jamie): and hey i'm all for is jaime and arya take turns stabbing
Jamie (Jamie): YES
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea they were suuuper careful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh mood LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): can they ...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): do the bumbleby thing
Jamie (Jamie): lmao YES PLEASE
Jamie (Jamie): killed by her brother and a stark would be such a good karma hit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): god i would scream
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...not that i havent screamed multiple times the past few episodes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i literally had to pause the ep to scream at the brienne jaime scene at the beginning
Jamie (Jamie): yea truth and yea literally them going for it in the perfectly lightly awkward way they did was a big FINALLY and done so right imo
Jamie (Jamie): okay this is a good use of book info to how jaime really feels
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bl6bdo/spoilers_the_difference_between_book_jaime_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x

Jamie (Jamie): POOR TORMUND THO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i feel bad.... but also...brienne never showed interest in him
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so like buddy ..... time to stop
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you tried
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and were turned down
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bl3zbz/no_spoilers_ign_with_the_important_statistics/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he drinks and he knows thingas
Jamie (Jamie): yea now take the good boi and live wylde in the true north
Jamie (Jamie): yes yes he does
Jamie (Jamie): but also damn just the amount of confliction tyrion has currently having to say "oh he doesnt want the throne its totally not an option ha...ha...ha"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hot take: dany needs to die, shes losing her mind from all her set backs  and would be a horrible queen lmao but jon also would be terrible
Jamie (Jamie): it's honestly true i used to love her character but she has shown so many signs of madness increasing since she landed in westeros
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jon doesnt want the throne, but dany is trying to take it....by murdering tons of innocent people
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she used to be my favorite
Jamie (Jamie): also this says the things really well and is kind of a solid theory
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/blc9z9/spoilers_it_was_sansa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): sansa deserves the throne
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if she doesnt end up with it i will be upset
Jamie (Jamie): also back when dany had the fever dreams and she walked into what appeared to be a destroyed a snow covered red keep throne room, it was all ash not snow and could even be a sign of her way to power and how she comes to an end as well
Jamie (Jamie): Winterfell becomes the new capitol of westeros
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): god i hope so
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the starks need to win
Jamie (Jamie): also arya as her hand and personal royal assassin and its perfect
Jamie (Jamie): the hound as one of the advisors
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i firmly believe tyrion would be loyal to sansa if she became queen
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like as well as the others
Jamie (Jamie): i do to, they have such an intriguing bond to be honest and i kind of love em as the good friends
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea! they work so well together
Jamie (Jamie): oh on side note poor fuk boi gendry lol
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/blc5uc/spoilers_when_you_hook_up_with_a_random_guy_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
Jamie (Jamie): he doomed himself saying she would be a lady the very thing she refuses
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i feel genuinely so bad for him though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like he doesnt understand why she refuses to be seen as a lady, he thought he was never good enough for her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and the second dany gave him the lord title
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he was liek
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "oh my GOD i need to find arya, im finally worthy"
Jamie (Jamie): yea i do feel bad for him but to arya he was literally just the friend she trusted enough to find out what sex is like before possible death
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like id be less sympathetic if he had spent time with her all these years while she was becoming "no one" and all the other shit shes been through
Jamie (Jamie): i think if he had gone about in a different way with wording and method it would have been better chance of her being okay with it
Jamie (Jamie): cause i would kinda love to see the kindling of hearts between a stark and the last of the baratheons
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean they definitely love eachother, arya and gendy is mirroring brienne and jaime
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but she has unfinished business
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cersei is still on her list
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and shes never wanted to be " a lady"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so obviously going to assasinate cersei is priority xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which honestly, mood
Jamie (Jamie): true and yea it really is
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bla9pl/spoilers_varys_is_the_true_mvp_of_the_seven/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
Jamie (Jamie): i do fear for varys's life now though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaa..... i hope he survives
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but its not looking good
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/blcpvu/spoilers_jon_snow_was_a_trueborn_stark_all_along/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
Jamie (Jamie): yea but i think he is gonna get word out before he dies so the secret is truely not a secret anymore
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): varys, local gossip girl
Jamie (Jamie): i still get sad about how sansa's good girl died like damnit no not the puppies
Jamie (Jamie): https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bl7u9s/spoilers_the_direwolves_and_the_the_starks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yo right??? saddest GoT deaths? dogs
Jamie (Jamie): no question
Jamie (Jamie): even when they first got the pups i was think fuck if the sweet fur babies are hurt fuck all involved. imo one season only of game of thrones and at the end all humans dead and the wolves are happy healthy and ruling the animal kingdom
Mark (Mad Doctor): Late to the game. But why does the Mother of Dragons need an insulating sleeve on her coffee? I thought she was fire resistant.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was planted by sansa to instil doubt in the northerners
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "i thought you could walk through fire? that cups not even hot!"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "FALSE QUEEN!!"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Love seeing Arya and the Hound on the road again. I'd love to see him retired to a simple life but I can't see Arya settling down. There might not be a role for her in a post-war world.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i unfortunately think arya is going to die in kings landing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i cant see her settling down ever.... and like you said she wont really have a place after the war
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think you're right.

And seriously, Jon, give your doggo hugs before you send him off!  Seriously they sent Ghost to a nice farm upstate!
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Get out of here, you expensive special effect, you"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): AT LEAST PET HIS HEAD
Mark (Mad Doctor): He got sent away like Tormund
