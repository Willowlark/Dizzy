Mark (Mad Doctor): Qrow does what we've all been thinking about!
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
snow ( karma chameleon ): emerald throwing cinder under the bus is me
Mark (Mad Doctor): Love how they keep adding depth to Emerald tho
snow ( karma chameleon ): ME TOO i think she's one of the most interesting characters
snow ( karma chameleon ): her semblance is fantastic
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Someone save my bird husband
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And Emerald and Merc
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also Qrow’s speech hurt me. He’s DEEPLY effected by this revelation. Probably more so than team RWBY because of how much he believed in Ozpin and how many people have died/left because of their cause 

Also you go Grandma Maria

Also the scene between Oscar and Ruby and Qrow’s comment mmmm JUST FUCK ME UP WITH THAT ANGST RT
Mark (Mad Doctor): Some good character development today, to be sure. Not much happened plot-wise, but I think Qrow, Yang, Hazel, Emerald and even Salem and Ruby had really good moments. And Tyrian has cemented his role as The Guy Everyone Wants To See Die
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Mercury even had slight development
Halim (Greg): Real talk mercury telling Tyrian off was a great moment
