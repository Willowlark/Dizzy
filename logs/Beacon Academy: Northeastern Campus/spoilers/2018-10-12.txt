Marisa (Weeb): that person saw a .5 second clip in a short trailer i'm *pretty sure* they know what they're talking about
Erik (slendergiant): Clearly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): tits or gtfo
Erik (slendergiant): As for his chest not being bare, they probably went with a more historically accurate costume?
Erik (slendergiant): And practical
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): #womenneedeyecandytoo
Erik (slendergiant): ~~because don't deserts get feckin' cold at night?~~
Erik (slendergiant): Also, I'm fucking excited to see Will Smith as the Genie
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜¯ I had no idea Will Smith was to be the genie in this... that makes me hype now lol
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah lmao
Erik (slendergiant): `Despite initial reports, the animal characters Abu the monkey, Iago the parrot, and Rajah the tiger from the original Disney movie will be appearing in some capacity.`
Erik (slendergiant): Ok, now I'm upset
Marisa (Weeb): eeh why
Erik (slendergiant): Oh wait never mind I thought it said would ***not*** be appearing
Marisa (Weeb): they made this a musical right? there were reports of it not having any musical numbers but it's gotta be a musical right
Marisa (Weeb): ya we safe on the animal front
Erik (slendergiant): ***DISREGARD***
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if they dont make it a musical im going to throw down
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they cant keep making these live actions without any of the songs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~mulan, i'm looking at you~~
Marisa (Weeb): musical and new song confirmed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GOOD
Marisa (Weeb): china has a bunch of really good serious mulans  already so *disney give us the musical*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Casting Will Smith and not making it a musical would be a huge wasted opportunity.
Erik (slendergiant): So question, with them trying to keep the casting towards POC, would casting Robin Williams to reprise his role as the genie (were he still alive) cause an uproar?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): POC?
Erik (slendergiant): People of Color
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ah.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Well, Genie is blue.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Unless there's a smurf in hollywood...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't think the issue really applies to the character.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~and no one can our perform Robin Williams, bless him~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): I love that they got a guy with Robin Williams levels of energy but a totally different kind of energy to play the role
Mark (Mad Doctor): And the medieval Muslim world covered everything from Spain to Subsaharan Africa to South Asia, so pretty much anyone could show up in Agrabah, if you ask me
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Id disagree, Agrabahs design is much more Indian/Persian/Arabian
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Sure anybody could show up, the arab world was huge on trade then
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): But its primary casting should definitely be POC, mostly Arabian
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): As for the Genie question, having him play Genie probably would be fine, I assume Genies mostly CGI anyways
Mark (Mad Doctor): Fair point. I was just saying they could rationalize a wide range of racial types if they wanted to. I agree with you about the casting though, and I think Disney is finally at a point where we can trust them to do it right. Compare their casting in recent films (Moana) vs the VAs in the Lion King
