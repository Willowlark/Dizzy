Rebecca (madameterralupus): Finally home from work and was able to watch the short. And oof yo that was hella good 👌🏻
Erik (slendergiant): Things heating up on my Tumblr post about Tauradonna...
Mark (Mad Doctor): I agree that the fight choreography is worth getting excited about again. The animation seemed like it was taking another step forward, too, with the flex of Ilia's sword and the way Blake's ears responded to the emotional content of her conversation with Adam. They keep the rich backgrounds of vol. 5. More thought seems to be going into framing each shot--the fight with Ghira told the story well while letting us see the reactions of characters without losing any pacing. The only thing I didn't care for was Adam's voice acting. At times I could tell he was reading lines.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mmm, I don’t think the VA likes new edgy lord Adam.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also ye Blake’s ears. Oof there’s so much emotion through them alone.
Erik (slendergiant): Ok so it's not just me that thinks his VA is garbage
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): there were some pretty meh lines in it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though iirc his rant in v5 was well acted?
Mark (Mad Doctor): I don't remember thinking his voice acting was bad before, so maybe this was just a rare swing and a miss
Erik (slendergiant): Idk, i've always just thought his lines weren't delivered very naturally. Maybe I just need to rewatch
