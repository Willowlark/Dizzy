ZombieHunter: People on fb: WHY DOES WEISS GET A NEW OUTFIT?! RT is so lazy wAAAAG
Me, an intellectual: probably because her last outfit was shanked through.
ZombieHunter: 52000 members. One fb group. How whiny can they be?
ZombieHunter: So whiny. Erik help
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Was it RWBY Republic because that’s literally the bottom barrel RWBY fans
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I hatenthat group so much
Evie (Katheryne Knight): All they do is bitch, shit on cosplayers who aren’t perfect, and not abide to the 48hr rule for spoilers
Mark (Mad Doctor): Only people who have put themselves out there as cosplayers should be allowed to shit on cosplayers and even then they should abide by the ironclad rule "NEVER SHIT ON COSPLAYERS"
Jess (whoozica): thaaaat sounds terrible
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Y E P
Honestly people that “criticize” cosplay who don’t cosplay need to sit down.
But that’s a topic for the Vent chat XD
Jess (whoozica): anyone who criticizes a cosplay online when the criticism wasn't asked for is like "y u do?" to me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeeeep
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh and “criticism” being “Your nose is wrong”
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I shit you not, I had a friend who got that comment
Jess (whoozica): WHAT "oh sorry lemme just get plastic surgery"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Now a days if someone said that to me I’d be like “you gonna subscribe to my patron so I can pay for my plastic surgery?” XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If they hear the word “pay” they shut up
snow ( karma chameleon ): YUP
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Half the reason I’m hesitant on even starting one in the first place. XD 

If we wanna keep talking about this, should we move to vent chat cause I feel I’m clogging up the spoiler chat.

SPOILER: Gen is salty
