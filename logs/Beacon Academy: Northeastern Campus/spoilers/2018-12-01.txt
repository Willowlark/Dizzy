Mark (Mad Doctor): "Ozpin isnt the voice in Oscar's head...I AM!!!!!!"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OH.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The hands in the OP.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That grab Qrow.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s what’s in the basement.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It has to be.
Georgia (Something Sensible): When doth the episode drop again
Georgia (Something Sensible): I end up working so many Saturdays I don’t even know anymore
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 11 minutes ago
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leanna gunna shit bricks again.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pictured: a Grimm.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We all assumed there’d be an arc in the house. Not so. ~~we also assumed there’d be character development. Not so~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Light on the combat, but given the encounter type I’ll give it a pass?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The farms name: Miranda.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): There definitely was character development for ruby
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I SAID THAY TOO <@!184437198865563648>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I literally screamed at Chris “THWY’RE REDEADS”
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im happen the episode didn’t end in sadness 
I’m happy bird husband is away from the alcohol other than his personal flask
I’m happy that things might look up now XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): FINALLY ASKING THE FUCKING QUESTION ABOUT HER EYES
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ALSO YANG GRABBING BLAKE'S HAND
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM SOBBING
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I NEED SOMEONE TO LITERALLY SCRAPE ME OFF THE FLOOR IF THEY THINK IM DOING ANYTHING TODAY
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, agreeing with Leanna. Definitely some Ruby development
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YANG GRABBED HER HAND
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM A DISASTER
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Are we counting silver eyes for Ruby?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cause I consider that more plot than character.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): No
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Qrow: drops bottle
> *shatters*
> *Ruby jumps awake*
> Ruby: "Was that Pyrrha being glassed?!"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also:
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm counting ruby getting angry with qrow. Her initial anger and throwing the bottle against a wall.

Also her hugging him and telling him it's ok to talk to her. 
Also her taking the lead and making sure to protect her friends. Her asking questions. She was the main focus of this episode. ~~which is unheard of for rwby~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): She actually was the main character for once lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm also counting how she talked when weiss and yang and blake hanged up on her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ganged*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Old woman: "Well, I had silver eyes"
> Next episode: *World of Remnant*
> Then: "Emerald and Mercury get scolded by Hazel"
> Then: "So what has JNPR been up to"
> then: "World of Remnant; as narrated by Peter Port"
> Then: "World of Remnant; as narrated by Peter Port part 2"
> then: "Salem cackling for twenty minutes"
> then: "Look fuck it we have no idea what the silver eyes do, Monty drew a lewd sketch of Velvet over that page of the show bible and we give up."
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The instant regret and panic after dropping the relic in the well. There was a lot that we havent seen from ruby emotionally.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I 100% agree
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hmm. Alot of the stuff with the team was under duress due to the Apathy. I don't quite count that as character interaction, cause that conversation wouldn't have happened without the Grimm. It *was*, but it doesn't evolve the pre existing character, in a way.

You totally right about the panic and regret, and DEFINITELY the Qrow stuff. ~~I guess I'm so used to RT not focusing on Ruby I wasn't paying attention~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We got stiffed on bees talking about Adam more, or Weiss being insecure (which was entirely because of the ~~redeads~~ apathy so fair).
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~bees held hands so I'm satisfied~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I need real character interaction before I'm willing to ship it~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk why but I don’t really like the apathy
Georgia (Something Sensible): Feels like a weird Grimm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, it’s a Zelda monster so.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Though I appreciate the lore reveal through the journaling
Georgia (Something Sensible): That was kinda cool
Georgia (Something Sensible): LMAO RWBY REDDIT FOR THIS EPISODE IS GREAT
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): JESUS
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone pointed out that since Weiss killed some of them with the fire, she can possibly summon them now?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF COULD YOU IMAGINE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Unless they didn’t die.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^^ yeah
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She lit them on fire but they kept walking
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah unless they just walked off the burning tru
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone said they’re glad Blake is actually talking to people now LOL
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OH yeah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ngl I saw the episode thumbnail as old woman reading and I was like “shit world of remnant” but NOPE
Georgia (Something Sensible): LOL ITS RUBYS PATRONUS
Evie (Katheryne Knight): PFFFT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im waiting for that edit now
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Someone else called out the Serenity parallel.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Some people are worried the silver eyed thing is too OP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Additional layer to the redeads.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Maria did point out the Grimm were physically relatively weak
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t quite trust RT to not Subvert fights via silver eyes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Every Grimm fight can be cut from the show, saving them effort.
Jamie (Jamie): I just wanna ask did anyone see it coming that the old lady has silver eyes when she got added to the show like she was?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Most of us did yea
Jamie (Jamie): Missed a word there lol
Jamie (Jamie): Okay wanted to be sure it was as obvious to others as it was to me lol
