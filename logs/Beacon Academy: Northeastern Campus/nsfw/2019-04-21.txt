Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Somebody sent it to me at like 5 AM so I figured I'd just pass it on like the other ones 🤷‍♂️
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I am in a lot of tag groups on fb 
So like in a comments section u just @ them and it shows up as a linked comment
My other favorite is "sounds like MLM" (pyramid schemes) and "fetch me a mellon baller I tire of my vision"
Jamie (Jamie): these sound like great groups to peruse through for ridiculous content
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Yes there's also "things we wished rule 34 had skipped"
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: And "the doctor bronners soap label makes more sense than this"
Jamie (Jamie): is the MLM one ending in "but okay"
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Yes
