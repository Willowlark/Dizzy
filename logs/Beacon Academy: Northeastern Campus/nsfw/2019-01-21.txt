Mark (Mad Doctor): In Philly's Mutter Museum, they have several drawers full of objects that have been removed from stomachs and...other cavities that you can browse through.  Lightbulbs, seriously?
Marisa (Mawisa): o the mutter museum is really cool!! i've passed out there before. just full on collapsed in a room of skulls and stuff they pulled out of people's intestines. good if you like science.
Mark (Mad Doctor): One of the skulls on the wall might be an ancestor of my wife! Same last name and from the same region of Poland where her mother's family is from. It was full of med students trying to act cool when I took the kids last summer.  My kids were not acting cool ("Holy crap! Is that a colon?"). A guard saw how much fun they were having and gave them a personalized tour. Very cool
