Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lol rip Noah
Georgia (Something Sensible): RIP we were just trying to do physics
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think the secondary takeaway from this, is that its extremely likely that someone at a rwby shoot somewhere has considered sleeping with you
Georgia (Something Sensible): a terrifying thought, really
Rebecca (madameterralupus): O__o
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~not to increase the terrifyingness kf the thought but like~~

Georgia (Something Sensible): wow new jersey has at least two slots on the no shave november leaderboards
Georgia (Something Sensible): go jersey
Georgia (Something Sensible): #2 and #8 slots
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Does no shave November include the nether reasons
Like do i not get to trim that either if i commit? It is an important question, as things get itchy. While Trimming is allowed in some situations such at work where "grooming and trimming are perfectly acceptable" (November). Many argue that it is not within the spririt of the tradition, because it its core, "the goal of No-Shave November is to grow awareness by embracing our hair, which many cancer patients lose, and letting it grow wild and free." (November). Therefore, based on these rules, I have come to the conclusion, that while trimming may be appropriate in some cases, unless its for the sake of another, trimming the nether regions is not within the true spirit of No-shave November, even if it gets really itchy.
