Jess (whoozica): ye imriecosplay and daisycosplay i think? they're italian i believe. super cute couple i know they were getting shit for reylo too
Jess (whoozica): so since you guys were talking aboutt hem i went and followed aicosu, and now i am very educated on their sex life
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): how'd you manage that.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao yeaaa xDD and cause they had a sexy Q and A on their story last night Bill lol
And mhmm every time I tell someone I ship Reylo they are like ew why? XD only one person I know ships it so her and I are always like sharing stuff 😂
Jess (whoozica): ~~what is i did that~~ JK i could never
Jess (whoozica): oh yea imriels and his gfs reylo shoot is good stuff. i mean i haven't seen the movies but the two of them look great
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I finally had a chance to look those other two cosplayers up and mmmph yesss 😫👌🏻
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Right? They pretty good. I like thier flame.girl.and wax guy stuff too
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I can't remember the names of the characters
Jess (whoozica): icarus and the sun!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I only flipped through the stories (remind me later, at the client site right now so can't sit on insta to look at LEWDS) but his Lotor is *on point*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Is this <@!301927856240459777>?~~
Jess (whoozica): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD

Honestly doing sexy shoots like that would be fun and neat... I've wanted to do a roy x riza one for years now but Oof body confidence... nope 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Be confident. It's basically the same as shooting swim wear at CCE!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Which is why I need to look into boudoir actually, can probably reverse engineer posing from boudoir to do better poolside photos.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Boudoir is neat on it's own, but as a dude it's not something I'll can 'choose' to do.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I deff think once I get back in shape I'll be more confident 😅 and mhmm this is true but it's deff a bit more revealing and sexy... which Oof me being sexy is a fail 😂😂
I might experiment at Katsu to see how I feel on doing boudoir cause I chickened out at CCE lol
Jess (whoozica): i understand, its the context of it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Aww, sorry to hear that. And who isn't a derp trying to be sexy? 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD this is true... lol.
Jess (whoozica): id like to try it but like id have to post it on a whole other account if at all cuz some of my family follows me on insta
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa if I ever did I would make a separate account.. cause i don't need my family, and old high school friends seeing it. 😂 I mentioned about doing it to my mom the other week and she didn't seem thrilled
Jess (whoozica): my mom prob woudlnt mind too much as long as I wasnt actually nakkie? but I have alot of family that doesnt understand cosplay. my dad probably wouldnt like it XD
Jess (whoozica): my dad thinks my 2b costume is "too much" XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): my mom is one of those CCE moms who freaked out over swimsuits
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SO
Jess (whoozica): 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO BED HERE I AM PLANNING SONIC BOUDOIR
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *BED HERE* is right
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I DONT KNOW WHY I TYPED THAT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You should be careful... it is true that employers look around your social media and if they stumble on it that could hurt you.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My dad's pretty care free. He's like eh do what ya want just be safe it seems. But my moms pretty peticular about things sooo... I mean she freaked out a bit when I cosplayed Yoko Littner years ago so 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Doing it is all you, my warning is just with posting.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And mhmm! Matt knows a lady who used to be a teacher and she had to post all her boudiors elsewhere cause doing that was a no no lol.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't think there's a Dad out there who likes boudoir lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm tempted to go ask my dad now what he thinks of it 😂
Jess (whoozica): if i did it would probably be a private account?  Its bad enough my uncle saw my CCE pics from alst year and asked my if im "into some weird sex bdsm shit or something" at me other uncles funeral 😱
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh my GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lmaoooooooooooooooooooo
Jess (whoozica): lmao yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM SO SORRY THATS AWFUL
Jess (whoozica): luckily my other cousin stepped and saved me cuiz i was like 😮
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~why would your *uncle* want to know?~`
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Block all your family members from your story, make a story post about the new account, let people join, then renable family members to the stories. That would work.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I asked my dad and he didn't even know what it was until I explained. He then was like eh okay and shrugged xD soo yea care free lol. 
And yooo what... that's really weird to ask... like what o.O
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Huh. Never thought of private account that way. Rather than so you only let people you know in, you use it so you only let people you don't in.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wild.
Jess (whoozica): i already block my fam from stories
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~If Mom ever asks I tell her everything from instagram is on facebook (true, for posts), so she has *no idea* my stories exist~~
Jess (whoozica): my mom tried to make an instagram, but she couldnt get the app cuz she forgot her apple password so rip i guess
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My mom follows me but never really watches my stories. I think she did when I was at Katsu but that's it lol 
I have all my aunts blocked cause they question too much and have no filter when commenting 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My extended family are a bunch of fucks, Mom is satisfied with facebook, sister doesn't care, and Dad doesn't care. I'm golden. <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Jess (whoozica): my ex's aunt (but actually adoptive mom) follows me and she kept commenting "how d u afford all these costumes" and im like NONYA BUSINESS
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah, I don't show my family anything from my Instagram. They've barely even seen any of my cosplays because I don't post them much to Facebook
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Love my parents, but they've never understood anime and I don't expect they ever will.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So I don't bother.
Jess (whoozica): which is kind of surprising as your dads a huge nerd
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mom's probably the biggest fan of my non cosplay stuff ~~which I need to do more of but its hard to find the time and I enjoy shooting friends more~~.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Dad is D&D, Fantasy novels, war games, miniatures, Scifi, pretty much everything old school.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Anime is one of few things that doesn't interest him much.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I get it though.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, anime *is* trash.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): high pitched school girls spending 20 minutes talking about how to eat chocolate cornets or men screaming at each other for 20 episodes isn't actually *good*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But we like what we like.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Only thing I'd want them to acknowledge is not *all* anime is the trashy stuff. Like, Andrew watched Wolf Children with his Mom and I was like 'that's really sweet' cause the movie is all about mothers and children.
Jess (whoozica): i felt embarrassed to tell my parents about my cosplay stuff, but then i did and they were like "good job sweetie your doing fine" and i was like ????
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~they got used to Tom, they can handle anything~~
Jess (whoozica): ohhhh ye i told my dad to watch castlevania cuz he would like it and its on netflix
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My whole family is supportive of it. They enjoy seeing each outfit I do, the stuff I make and how different I look. Both my dad and grandpa have helped me make props for many costumes. They just hate how expensive it can be.  Only one who's a bit of a dick about it is my brother buuuttt he's mostly just that way to push my buttons. I know he thinks it's cool cause he sometimes asks when my next event is and what I'm doing lol
Erik (slendergiant): I'm lowkey afraid to watch subbed anime too loudly because I feel like all the high pitched girly shouting and squealing sounds would sound like porn to my parents
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMFAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH THATS A FUCKING MOOD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have definitely had that thought at some point.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eh, as I said it it gives my parents a bad wrap. Having a personal interest in my interests is one thing, but they've always been supportive. Dad took me to my first con, NYAF.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sometimes too supportive.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Mom continues to think I should be charging for con photography~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My dad's never been to a con but he helps me make a lot of props (i.e. gunchucks) my mom though has been to several cons... she gets enjoyment seeing all the weird shit that goes one xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Both are glad I have a hobby to keep me busy, happy and are glad I have  found good friends through it 🤗
Erik (slendergiant): > *anime girl fawns over **food** and makes excited moaning noises*
Erik (slendergiant): https://media.giphy.com/media/STZz8sKCr4ces/giphy.gif
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oh babe that's cuz your uncle is insane tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *> Anime girl in literally orgasms when eating food
> This is a real anime*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Marisa's mom not only cosplays with her, she also serves on the Zenkaikon staff.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): so... I think Bojo wins.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): BITCH GOT USED TO ME? THEY **LOVE** ME FAM
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *True, he cooks*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Tom, visiting Jess's parents with Jess
> Tom: "I'll cook tonight, parents!"
> Jess's Mom: "Why thank you"
> Tom: *Puts on RWBY apron*
> Jess's Parents: *shrug*
> Tom: *Puts on Ren wig*
> Jess's Mom: "Uh."
> Jess: "Hush Mom this is the good part"
> Jess: 🍿
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I almost got my mom to cosplay with me but I never did the costume... we were gonna do Merida and her mom lol
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Lmaoo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~off to work so my response will be delayed probs till 9:30 lol~~
Jess (whoozica): ooo thats so cool!
Jess (whoozica): a girl I follw recently got her parents to cosplay and i was like "damn thats the real dream"
ZombieHunter: My mom calls me a nerd
ZombieHunter: And compares me my life to Big Bang theory
ZombieHunter: ;_;
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Are you not a nerd tho? 😛
ZombieHunter: They were working on Comic-Con cosplays and the girls in the show were talking about the boys
ZombieHunter: “It was so cute he was workin on his little costume all week”
ZombieHunter: Mom go away
ZombieHunter: OH WAIT
ZombieHunter: I HAVE THE BEST ONE
Jess (whoozica): "little costume"
ZombieHunter: 
ZombieHunter: From my mom
ZombieHunter: 😐
Jess (whoozica): "i know" she just accepts it XD
ZombieHunter: RIGHT
ZombieHunter: my dad doesn’t like when I work on cosplay
ZombieHunter: He calls me OccupytheLivingroom
ZombieHunter: :3
ZombieHunter: I’m a good child damnit
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Lmaooo
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): my  mom is the reason my Salem wigs exist 😂 😂
Jess (whoozica): BLESS
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): My dad is the stereotypical old school nerd, he stood in line for 8hrs to see the original Star Wars movies, used to read comics and all that. My parents love my cosplays- they like all the different outfits and everything. The anime tho… that they don’t get 😂
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I made the mistake of watching a few episodes of konosuba in the living room one time and it didn’t end well
Erik (slendergiant): yikes
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Aqua was the downfall
Erik (slendergiant): I mean, that skirt is just a *tad* short
ZombieHunter: I’m gonna fight this one girl in class
ZombieHunter: So help me god
Georgia (Something Sensible): Do it
Mark (Mad Doctor): My parents were always tolerant of my nerdery, but my last recorded tantrum was when they took away my DnD books because my grades were slipping
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey's other grandma doesn't hesitate to slut shame her when she cosplays
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): My mom is looks at my cosplay and anime
and she always says the same thing "I just wish I understood all of this....this thing"
cause it all falls under one umbrella
Jess (whoozica): My dad walked into our computer room and was like "damn these anime girl sure got big boobs" meanwhile we don't even have anything that bad?? My mom thinks my Hanzo poster and Chrom poster are hawt tho 😂
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oh and Ezio
Jess (whoozica): Ye but I don't have a post for him 😂
