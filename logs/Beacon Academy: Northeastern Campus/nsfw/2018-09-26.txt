Distant Thunders: Still got some of the original ones
Distant Thunders: Remember being super excited to get them in the mail
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I know that I created this chat and put the topic thing
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): but the fact that I added "NO PORN" to the _nsfw_ chats description is a bit amusing 
Both because its an nsfw chat
and because after all this time there was clearly no need to worry about that cause all we discuss is bionicles and the like
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well. Whose idea was it to make the channel in the first place? The guy who left.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): actually no
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): i thought it was rei?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pretty sure it was Ethan.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we use it sometimes for actual nsfw though so its good to have.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but it is comical when i open it ..at work and its bionicle discussions
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yup.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I rarely worry about opening NSFW at work.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): reasons I love this group: 
I'm at work and somebody sees me open the NSFW chat and only sees bionicles
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): or discussions of Taxes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's good for risqué images ye.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): such as: the bionicle with the bobbing head
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): very risqué
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~or Bowsette~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's the other NSFW tho.
Erik (slendergiant): Now I have something to preoccupy myself with at work: go back through the server to find out who suggested it
Jess (whoozica): ~~is this where i should talk about real estate listings? very adult topic~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I scrolled up to January 25th of this year
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I counted the number things that one could consider nsfw between now and then
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): it was 5, and even some of those are debatably nsfw
Mark (Mad Doctor): Unless you're Excitable Puritan Lady at CCE
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): well yes
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): then I think you might reach 7 or 8 maybe
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): maybe 10
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 1 per month
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~this whole server is a sin to her~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): thats fair
Jess (whoozica): damn erotic cosplayers
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *She's right tho, look at how Erotic this is*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): fuck
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *So much exposed... arm...or*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~literally satan, right there~~
Erik (slendergiant): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I appear to be wrong.
Erik (slendergiant): But Ethan was involved. He like couldn't sleep or something and Rei said "my nly suggestion is too nsfw for this channel"
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~doing your taxes?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://blog.jlist.com/featured/japanese-manga-and-artists-join-in-on-the-bowsette-fun/
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm not surprised the Dragon Maid artist likes Bowsette.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Goblin Slayer artist got in on it <@!351785752197201920> <@!301927856240459777>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): _watches as every artist I follow everywhere does at least one Bowsette_
Erik (slendergiant): Don't worry, I won't
Erik (slendergiant): 😉
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay but Boodette is where it’s at
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also redhead buff Bowsette is where it’s at too
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like lord I’ll cosplay thay in a damn heartbeat ~~Considering my old Pyrrha wig will work perfectly~~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: obviously. the most nsfw topic is t*xas.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I read that as “Tatas”
Georgia (Something Sensible): I was like, do people still use that word?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Tatas is a beautiful word
Georgia (Something Sensible): But is it still _used_?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don't think so.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I haven’t heard it in at least 4 years
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd feel like the six flags old man saying 'tatas'.
Georgia (Something Sensible): And that’s not an invite for anyone to say tatas when they next see me just to ruin the streak of not hearing it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://giphy.com/gifs/old-man-2eN4b6488AQwg
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~You know, no one was going to do that until you lampshaded it~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I use tatas for fun
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'm sure many people do~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): LMAO
Erik (slendergiant): I think the new politically correct term is "tiddies"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think it "bobbies"
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Tig ol bitties
Georgia (Something Sensible): Step aside losers
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s 5318008
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~physics joke?~~
Jess (whoozica): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Jess (whoozica): Oldest meme in the book
Georgia (Something Sensible): Billiam please did you not ever put 5138008 in a calculator and turn it upside down
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Do I *seem* like the kind of person who does that?
Georgia (Something Sensible): .................. I thought everyone did that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I get it now, but wasn't my first thought.
Jess (whoozica): ~~everyone does that~~
Erik (slendergiant): Now we have fancy graphing calculators where you can just type out "BOOBIES" normally
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): truly gods work.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): True but that's no fun
