Rebecca (madameterralupus): Unsure what chat so I'll put here? 
Pffttt I was looking at some stuff for my Raven boudoir and the one I was looking at said it had a snap closure... I was just like <:lenny:456549338026344489> *Oh, for some easy fuk* And then I read this in the description:  "Snap Closure bodysuit allows you to open the bottom for trips to the bathroom without having to take off the entire garment, or to put it on over your head and then attach underneath" 
Still me: Pffttt sure, that's what it's used for <:lenny:456549338026344489>
