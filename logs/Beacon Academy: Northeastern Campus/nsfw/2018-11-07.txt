And valid, you right Georgia
Mark (Mad Doctor): <@288513265661902858> Your new BNE name is Greg
Jess (whoozica): Just be like "Im really sorry you have the wrong person, im not Greg"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Are you the New Doug?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Good guy in me says reply saying it's the wrong number, tell her you'll delete the photo, and *actually* do it
Georgia (Something Sensible): Pretend to be a girl if you want her to feel better lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or just don't respond
Halim (Greg): Hi I have become greg
Halim (Greg): (Just for BNE)
Marisa (Weeb): gg greg
Jess (whoozica): Erik you are a good man
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I try
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm not sending you any pictures, Greg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed with Erik. I would say do what Georgia says but can get iffy depending
Halim (Greg): See if this was on any form of social media I would assume a bot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Don't pretend to be a girl lol
Halim (Greg): But it's a text message 
Yeah no
Halim (Greg): I'll just be really gay
Mark (Mad Doctor): And yes, 100% with the Erik solution. No need to mention gender
Jess (whoozica): Nah i dont think its a bot, oo i feel bad for her though
Georgia (Something Sensible): She gonna think Greg is ghosting her tho
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What's worse, being given the wrong number or being ghosted?
Georgia (Something Sensible): She couldâ€™ve just typed it wrong...... ðŸ˜¦
Marisa (Weeb): yeah that is possible
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also with ghosting she may still lust for Greg
Georgia (Something Sensible): Who will never come ðŸ˜­
Georgia (Something Sensible): At least with a wrong number it hurts but the embarrassment is over quick
Jess (whoozica): yea just be nice and polite and tell her you're sorry but you're not greg
