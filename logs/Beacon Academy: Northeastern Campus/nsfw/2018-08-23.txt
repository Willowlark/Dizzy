Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I saw a Ruby at RTX and Chris and i were like “is she cosplaying from that one hentai comic?”
Erik (slendergiant): wasn't that MicroKitty?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): any of you tumblrites want to explain why Tumblr is so fond of dick girls?

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but now i understand where this came from
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i have no idea my dude, i dont venture to that part of the website
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Tumblr loves girls right
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): And loves seeing them fucked by big dicks
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): But tumblr doesnt like dudes
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): The solution?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Put dicks on girls
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Side note 
Tumblr is ok with dudes if theyre with other dudes
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): They love that too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't understand tumblr.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Safe Search: a necessary part of tumblr.
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): Hal's explanation is pretty spot on actually...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!386874959009415170> it wasn’t Microkitty. She just recently put that together. This was just some Ruby cosplayer in the line at the RT store XD
Erik (slendergiant): ah gotcha
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): OH WAIT THATS THE GIRL JIGGLYPUFF RANTED ABOUT
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): she's like 16/17 or something
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *woooow* okay, I'm glad I haven't recognized anything related to the doujin.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): eh cosplay what you want 
regardless of the source content, in the con center its just a work out ruby at the  end of the day
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, that's the right attitude, but a minor cosplaying an explicit *porn* design?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): yeahhhh its cringy for sure
Erik (slendergiant): *Minors cosplaying hentai porn of characters who are also minors...*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): please don't make it worse.
