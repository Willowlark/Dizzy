ZombieHunter: After I told her this is the largest organ. After mine of course.
Marisa (Mawisa): wow you must be really generous to have such a big heart
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~ok but like the largest human organ is your skin~~
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ~~is hunter actually a god in disguise hiding his true form~~ 
~~which is actually a 20 ft tall god man~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Your intestines are over 20 feet long naturally but hunter’s heart is bigger than his intestines
ZombieHunter: Leanna told me I’m not allowed in the music section
