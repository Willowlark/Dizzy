Evie (Katheryne Knight): So... I'm tempted to make an NSFW Twitter so I don't make my ace friends uncomfortable.

And name it Katheryne Knut
Anna [Cyborg]: I mean you could just nest your stuff but also that pun
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg that name though. I love it xD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I would nest but I really don't know how to do that.

Just would rather be like "This is my NSFW twitter"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): "Which means tiddy and possible vagoo"
