Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: How do people not use loofah
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you use a washcloth
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm sorry for you
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Also people who use bar soap
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im saving the environment fuck u
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao I tried showering with my SO to save water once at a con and we then realize there was no fucking towels... üò±Matt still picks at me about it to this day. So not always a good idea fam LOL

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i like those scrubby poof things
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you can launder wash cloths.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Ye loofahs
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you cant launder a loofa
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you can only throw it out
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and do you know how much STUFF can grow in a loofah
Anna (loud and likely blonde): https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/news/a40645/shower-loofah-bacteria/
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Yeah... they get gross and ya gotta replace them p regularly depending on how often you shower and stuff
Jamie (Jamie): Judge jason because he literally just rubs the soap on with hands ~~his hairs create the soaping up but its still weird~~
Marisa (Mawisa): My loofah is one of my pets
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea but like. i can launder a washcloth and reuse it. so. money saving
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need the visible soapy lather and rough feeling on my skin that wash cloths do not provide
Jamie (Jamie): ~~he's a hairy boyman~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): **they cost like $1**
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Ok that's fair Anna
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yes but. fear of mold. makes me throw em out faster
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: My question was more directed to those who go loofah/washclothless
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I use one of them brush things
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im with you, i throw mine out and buy new ones pretty often
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And use bar soap
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i can also have stupid pictures on my washcloths its great
Erik (Red Riot Thot): how do people even use bar soap?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Oooo that sounds adorable
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I DONT KNOW ERIK
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: IT DRYS OUT YOUR SKIN AND FEELS HORRIBLE
Anna (loud and likely blonde): um. you kinda. rub the thing on it. and then keep rubbing and then its a nice lather and then u go
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i use bar soap cause its cheap but like . i use pears. its transparent and fun
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its good for tattoos
Rebecca (madameterralupus): With struggle and constantly having to pick it up. Also lol probs why my skin is so dry. Another contributer LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i also use liquid soap
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so
Anna (loud and likely blonde): liquid soap always dried my skin out worse idk
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just use whatever my parents buy and put in my shower to use xD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Get good moisturizing body wash and you'll be Gucci
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok but MONEYS
Anna (loud and likely blonde): gotta use what i got first
Jamie (Jamie): I've never had issue with drying out my skin ~~but im naturally oily and its a curse and I guess for this case a blessing~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and. bar soap lasts so long
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol lucky Jamie. As soon as cold weather hits my skin hates me and I'm always dry. üò© damn eczema
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think they discontinued the body wash I normally use. Gotta choose a new one... again...
Anna (loud and likely blonde): actually things that suds more dry out your skin more
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like i cant use a lot of toothpastes cause they dry my lips out so bad
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh shit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is that true? maybe thats why my lips are always fucking chapped
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood, the more you know
Anna (loud and likely blonde): sodium lauryl sulfate SLS is the thing
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk it helped when i cut it out
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and i use some sensitive bitch toothpaste
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~my teeth need extra fluoride~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm glad that almost immediately after switching to nsfw, we got into the health benefits of different soaps and shower products  xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Health is very nsfw
Anna (loud and likely blonde): according to lawmakers apparently
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the titty is forbidden
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and so is the bagina
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the peen is ok tho
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Wait 
Are you serious or is this just a joke
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Did lawmakers give an ok to peen but not bagina and titty
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in what context though
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Cause that sounds ridiculous but I've lost hope with US lawmakers
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ü§∑
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I mean have u seen how lawmakers think of a titty
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~must be hidden unless they are the one actively enjoying it~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Cest vrai
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *this is definitely more of a vent and rant thing but i had to read this with my own two eyes and now you do too*
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh my god
Georgia (Something Sensible): I need the eye bleach
Georgia (Something Sensible): I don‚Äôt live to kinkshame but scat kinks give me Fear‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
