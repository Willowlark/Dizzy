Evie (Katheryne Knight): I haven't been on Facebook for so long that I shared an NSFW post and forgot my family is friends with me
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Big scream
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oh lawd
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Guess I'll die
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What did you post
Evie (Katheryne Knight): "If a Dom doesn't do after care, they are abusive and not a real Dom"

My parents will see that and then I'll be under the interigation light XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They will be like "what's a Dom?" "What's aftercare"
Jess (whoozica): "who's Dom?"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And idk how to explain it to them because they see kinky sex as abusive
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Who's Dom? I thought you were dating Chris?*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's actually something my dad would ask
Evie (Katheryne Knight): For those of you who haven't met my dad he's kinda the dad of dad's
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He also isn't afraid to make sex jokes at the table which is why it shouldn't be difficult to explain but it is
Jess (whoozica): Does he have a shotgun?
Jess (whoozica): Did he polish it in front of Chris?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): No hes NOT a gun person XD

Evie (Katheryne Knight): He asks me what memes are
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He and my unclea

Evie (Katheryne Knight): My mom shares Kingdom Hearts stuff to me because I grew up playing the game and they like it too

My dad loves FFVII so he'll see a thing and share it to me
Jess (whoozica): Awww cute!
Jess (whoozica): My mom think Link is hot and said to me and Tom like 4 yes ago "I wish they still made those Zelda games"
Jess (whoozica): And I was like "well do I have news for you"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They are super supportive of my hobbies. 

Just not the mess cosplay brings XD

OMG I'd be like "Well... YA SEE"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *LET'S GET THIS TOAST*
Jess (whoozica): dAS gud, my parents are supportive too, is nice.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He hasn't said that yet but I've said "Lets yeet the wheat" around them and they asked me what that means and I had to explain to them it's like "GEDDER DUUUUN"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So I'm waiting for it
Jess (whoozica): Omg ðŸ˜‚
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I've "OwOed" in conversation with my parents accidently 

Hence why they didn't question why I wanted that hat for my birthday
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "accidentally" <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): IT WAS
I'm so used to using it in conversation that I sent it to them after I said "Yeah dinner is good! owo"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ooooh like a text conversation?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I thought you meant you verbally uttered "OwO" while talking to your parents ðŸ˜‚
Jess (whoozica): Ooo I've done that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have actually said "OwO what's this" at work in front of 50 year olds
Jess (whoozica): O me too
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And "oof" and "RIP"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I use "oof" and "yikes" on a regular basis
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Same
Usually referring to customers
Marisa (Mawisa): next cosplay group
Anna (loud and likely blonde): for konkon obvs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I lowkey always wanted to do Nudist beach Nonon but oof....~~
Marisa (Mawisa): lots of people use skin colored bodysuits
I got a fake g-cup chest for cosplay in japan im in for kill la kill <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): KLK group when?! ~~Once I can fit in Ryuko again LOL~~
Marisa (Mawisa): ASAP lets go
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ill get better at airbrush and give everyone abs
Marisa (Mawisa): YES PLEASE
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tape those finger lights to your bobbies for glowing nips
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg ðŸ˜‚
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~jots that down for penny ideas~~
Matt (mattmyers25): Imagine tai doing that
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i like his gun
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Bless this show ðŸ˜‚
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe i should try to watch this again
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I got halfway through and never finished
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk why I stopped tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): I got bored, but like, I like most of the stuff studio trigger puts out
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It was terribly over sexualized for my taste. I dropped it when Ryuko and her clothing had a heart to heart about having to embrace her nudity for power.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh... wait maybe thats why i stopped
Marisa (Mawisa): it was anti-lewd. fighting against lewdity.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also the art style was hard to watch tbh
Marisa (Mawisa): row row fight the power
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ryuko in the first episode was a kickass cool girl. When four episodes later she was discussing how she would have to accept running around in like, a string bikini I got annoyed.
Marisa (Mawisa): blumenkranz is such a jam and there was a lot of cute gammako art
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i thought the premise of kill la kill was that it was making fun of the oversexualized female superhero genre
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is it? i didnt get far enough to be able to tell xD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its a parody
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: do you know QUeens Blade?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nope
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its supposed to be mocking shows like that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'll have to look it up to see what you mean
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i am fake weeb
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~don't look up queen's blade~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's borderline porn.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I personally don't get it, but apparently a big part of the parody comes from the play on words that make sense in japanese
Evie (Katheryne Knight): NUDEST BEACH

I've wanted to do Nonon for so long
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but not in english
Marisa (Mawisa): oh yeah the title is a play on words
Marisa (Mawisa): kiru = to wear
kiru = to cut
kiru = the english word "kill" as written in japanese
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Which is more about the magic clothes than symbolism.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I love Kill la Kill
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm.trying to get Chris into that and Gurren
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I suggest giving it another go, while the clothes and artstyle are super ridiculous (unsurprising cause Parody) the characters are actually really cool 
except mako's family
Marisa (Mawisa): mako's family is cute
Marisa (Mawisa): they make croquettes of her face
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they keep peeping
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'll give it a shot, since i spent money on funimation to watch promised neverland
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): LeAnNa!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how did you find my lewds
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~it was a relatively normal katsu ad, until SHREK MASK~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats honestly effective advertising
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I swear Leanna if you don't do a set Shrek at some point I will RIOT XDD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): all my lewds are gonna be memes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): GOOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shrek, sonic, whatever new meme pops up
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...shaggy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): DO IT
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Even .01 percent of shaggy's power would destroy a camera sensor.
Georgia (Something Sensible): im so ready for it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Do Kermit the frog too while ya at it~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GOOD IDEA REBECCA
Matt (mattmyers25): Looks like she is an all star
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Do old memes count too? Lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): all memes

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): my ass can be the bongos

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That would be the point yes.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg Leanna
Matt (mattmyers25): Cue the bongos
Matt (mattmyers25): Also, time to rule 34 this
Rebecca (madameterralupus): > Someone yells cue bongos

Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Oh nooo~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *...really?*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....i dont know any of the rules dude
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜±
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): `Rule 34, if it exist there is porn of it.`
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we are not doing a porn matt
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Sure we not LOL. JK JK~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): JEsUs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -has flashbacks to that asshat who made megs photo into a brazzers ad- ......n-no
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea big yikes
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: major yike
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Indeed. Keep lewds sets to friends and SOs.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): imo
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~also yes rule 34 applies to JEsUs~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ......my bee ass tattoo doesnt count
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i sent that to everyone
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): nah.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): When or rather if I ever make my nsfw account I am literally only letting those I know personally follow it. Not strangers. AT ALL. Just makes me uncomfy and too many weirdos out there
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "hey wanna see my ass? here it is"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): > "Nice ass"
> "... What do you mean nice ass, do you not see the BEES"
> "Uh yeah. Nice tattoo too"
> "FUCKING BEES MAN, DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS SYMBOL"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...thats
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what happened
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not gonna lie, thats exactly what happened
Rebecca (madameterralupus): "Do you not see that bees own my ass mannn"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i can tell this is going to become a problem for me.

"you got a bee tattoo for bumbleby? show me!"

"it's on my ass"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): RIP
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just gonna have to moon everyone I guess
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -does it anyway-
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ¤·
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): > Arrested for public nudity
> they drag you into the car shouting
> "BEES ARE WHOLESOME THIS IS OPPRESSION"
> *"We like bees too you're just flashing your ass at a middle school"*
> "WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY ASS, WHO PAYS ATTENTION TO THAT ***WHERE THERE ARE BEES TO SEE***"
