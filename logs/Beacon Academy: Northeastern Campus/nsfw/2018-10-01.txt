Erik (slendergiant): So I was watching the hero license episodes last night and noticed something about Kaminari
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): The boy is collared. Sub confirmed
Erik (slendergiant): Also, <@327835140216586242> I would have to disagree about him being gay (unless you're just using "gay" as an overarching term) because remember he is Mineta's partner in crime when it comes to perving on girls. I'd say he's on the bi or bi-curious spectrum
Erik (slendergiant): But regardless, he's 100% sub
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): oh he's definitely bi
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~also i guess I need to buy a collar apparently~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yes he is bi, did I have him u see the wrong category???

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He a switch but I like it when he tops
