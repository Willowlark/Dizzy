Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!288513265661902858> I redownloaded League... ~~Now lets see if I ever remember to try playing lol~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Who ya gonna play as first?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I guess that depends on who you own first lol I think my recommendation would be Ashe or Garen, theyâ€™re the starting champs for a reason
Georgia (Something Sensible): Garen plays top, heâ€™s really tanky, and if you wanna play tanky with melee then heâ€™s really good for learning the mechanics
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Idk cause I don't even remember any of the characters XD 
I played it once.. like 5 years ago lmfao
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ashe is a ranged fighter, she plays bottom (as far as Iâ€™ve seen)
Georgia (Something Sensible): I would prefer her
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *bottom* <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): > *looks up character list*
> "Holy damn...*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 141
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There are 141 characters
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's too many choices for me XDD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, but there's only a handful of starters... good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The current roster of starter champions is as follows:

Aatrox
Ashe
Garen
Graves
Jinx
Katarina
Khaâ€™Zix
Lux
Riven
Ryze
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ‘€ *Jinx* I've always digged her design lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There's also start *running*.
Jess (whoozica): lol ive only ever played varris and annie
Jess (whoozica): OH and ryze
Georgia (Something Sensible): LUX IS MY WIFE
Georgia (Something Sensible): Her mechanic is nice and easy to learn
Georgia (Something Sensible): But once you get good you can be a savage
Erik (Red Riot Thot): since I'm bored I'm creating a starter stats chart so I can compare them all and see who I'd want to play as lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like as a Junkrat main, I'd enjoy playing as Jinx lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): Proooobably yes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Depends on play style too tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): Champs like Lux and Ezreal you have to have a degree of skill aiming
Georgia (Something Sensible): So even if you tend to like ranged characters, you may not like the mechanic they have
Georgia (Something Sensible): Thereâ€™s other ranged players that take less aiming lolol
Georgia (Something Sensible): But yes Jinx would prob be one of your favs
Georgia (Something Sensible): <@!169297844874903552> when are you gonna play? If you pick Ashe I can be your support and help ðŸ¤—
Georgia (Something Sensible): Same with you Erik, Jinx Iâ€™ve seen mostly as a bottom so I can support you too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thank you for supporting my bottom
Georgia (Something Sensible): ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰ always
Halim (Greg): I'd suggest playing Bottom champions first, as you will almost always have a person playing support, even when you play alone
Halim (Greg): Jinx 8s one of the easiest Bot champs to learn
Halim (Greg): Also add me Mobiusmelt is my username
Halim (Greg): Also I get off at 6 so I'll be back then to talk league with anyone who has questions
Georgia (Something Sensible): unsurprisingly my user is wezrez so feel free to add me too!
Georgia (Something Sensible): /boots up league again, immediately sees someone complaining
Georgia (Something Sensible): "ah yes i missed this game"
Halim (Greg): I havent played in months I missed the gMe so much
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There are plenty of better ways to lower your self esteem folks.
Halim (Greg): Ignore naysayers with their negativity 
And it's easy to enjoy League, especially with friends
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm doing the tutorial
Halim (Greg): Imma be busy till a bit late tonight with theatre responsibilities but I can play probs around 10:30/11
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Uggghhhh I don't want to do this now but if I quit I get temporarily banned?
Halim (Greg): The tutorial?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah
Halim (Greg): You should be fine 
Plus if it's just a 1 time ditch you should be fine 
You only get temp banned after multiple  drops
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Halim (Greg): It's just a default warning
Halim (Greg): It happens every time regardless
Halim (Greg): Also the temp ban is just a 5 minute queue dodging ban
Halim (Greg): Unless you do it a lot
Halim (Greg): You'll be fine
Halim (Greg): You can also just surrender since you're the only player
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeet
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because I need dinner and I was only on the second part of the tutorial and doing very badly
Georgia (Something Sensible): mood
Georgia (Something Sensible): i played a warm up game and ya gurl still got it
Georgia (Something Sensible): so rebecca or erik i have time for a match if you want my helps
Georgia (Something Sensible): prob until like 10 that offer stands, then i gotta go to a moooovie
Erik (Red Riot Thot): We'll see. Going out to dinner for my dad's birthday and then I gotta sit down and finish the tutorial lol
Jess (whoozica): Hap birth Erik dad
