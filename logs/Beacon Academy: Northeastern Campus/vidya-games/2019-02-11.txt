Marisa (Mawisa): Jaehee gonna mess some people up
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I read that as a black belt in Jumin. <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Mawisa): That too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Being a dick to Yoosung
Marisa (Mawisa): Wow without 707 even being there. Harsh
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he needs to get his shit together
Marisa (Mawisa): New chatroom opens with just Jumin talking about company stuff
Jaehee, in the phone call immediately afterwards: ‚Äú***boi***‚Äù
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Jumin is currently MIA with Elizabeth the 3rd
Marisa (Mawisa): Ewizabeth uwu
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Jess (whoozica): hes so sad
Marisa (Mawisa): Is this the route with Glam Choi?
Jess (whoozica): nah thats zens
Jess (whoozica): this is jumins
Marisa (Mawisa): And Sarah?
O wasn‚Äôt Zens route Echo Girl
Jess (whoozica): SHIT u right
Jess (whoozica): ~~sorry i file them in the same box~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No Marisa's right
Marisa (Mawisa): They have such distinct personalities <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fucking Sarah
Jess (whoozica): echo girl and glam choi are both terrible
Marisa (Mawisa): What day are you on I don‚Äôt wanna spoil
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's interesting how each route there seems to be a character in RFA that's kind of a dick about MC's choice. Like with Zen, Jaehee was trying to interfere. Now with Jumin, Zen's just being an ass
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm on Day 7
Jess (whoozica): yeaaaaaa
Marisa (Mawisa): Jumin sucks in Jaehee‚Äôs route lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I could imagine lol
Marisa (Mawisa): Is there someone like that in 7‚Äôs route? ü§î
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I forget who it was for Yoosung. Honestly Yoosung annoyed me during Yoosung's route lol
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~seven himself~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah I think Yoosung was his own worst enemy ü§î
Jess (whoozica): nah everyone pretty good in sevens route i think
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because he just became super pissy at V
Marisa (Mawisa): It‚Äôs also been 3 years since I‚Äôve done Yoosung tho
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and kept trying to prove himself to be mature for MC
Marisa (Mawisa): Have you done any of the after endings
Marisa (Mawisa): What is MC doing in Jumins route now
Jess (whoozica): ~~get shot in the eye to prove your maturity~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've done the after ending and the Valentine's ending for both Yoosung and Zen
Marisa (Mawisa): RIGHY the Valentine‚Äôs Day one‚Äôs that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm mixing up with after ending
Marisa (Mawisa): Yoosung isn‚Äôt even Yoosung in his
Marisa (Mawisa): He makes fun of his old self
Jess (whoozica): oo are the Vday ones in the future?
Marisa (Mawisa): Yee
Marisa (Mawisa): Seven‚Äôs even has two different endings
Jess (whoozica): YEA spicy and not spicy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://imgflip.com/i/2teu5t
Jess (whoozica): oh yoosung
Marisa (Mawisa): I can‚Äôt wait for Jumin to start spiraling out of control in Jaehee‚Äôs route
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Mawisa): ||he starts a fight with seven then steals sevens car and crashes it into a wall||
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Oh that's not lenny worthy.
Marisa (Mawisa): But it‚Äôs so good
Marisa (Mawisa): ||in Jaehee‚Äôs valentine ending you get locked in a closet with her||
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): || In Jumin's bad ends you get locked in a cage ||
Marisa (Mawisa): ||dont forget the v route orgy ending||
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): || the bad ends are great ||
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): || Don't forget the V route orgy doesn't include V because *no one loves him* ||
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Really sad cat‚Ñ¢
Marisa (Mawisa): ||cuz he‚Äôs taking pictures of it||
Marisa (Mawisa): Like, REALLY sad cat
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): || Trust me that is *not* the same ||
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I got a purple heart for choosing the sad cat option
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 707 didn't think it'd work
Marisa (Mawisa): ||meanwhile Yoosung ends up dead in almost all his bad ends||
Erik (Red Riot Thot): also this stupid game makes me want to try those chips
Marisa (Mawisa): Seven is the Korean equivalent of a dude who only eats Doritos and Mountain Dew
Marisa (Mawisa): Hot anime equivalent
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): || Kinky sex or character death, take your pick ||
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~why are we using spoilers if Erik is reading them~~
Jess (whoozica): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Jess (whoozica): cuz u want to temp him
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *I started cause Marisa was doing it*
Jess (whoozica): i meant both of you XD
Marisa (Mawisa): ||i thought it was fun and I wanted to *protect his innocent unspoiled eyes*||
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *He plays Mystic Messenger, any of those spoilers will remove any innocence he has*
Marisa (Mawisa): we could just start saying ridiculous stuff to mask the spoilers
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Bold of you to assume I have any innocense left
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *is it that bold*
Marisa (Mawisa): like remember when zen goes full juggalo, jaehee gets sick of jumin and shaves elizabeth, and the ending where you wind up in bed with rika?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *you went to church sunday of Swimsuit con*
Marisa (Mawisa): ||one of the above statements is true get guessin'||
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): || I already know ||
Jess (whoozica): i was about to say one of those is real
Marisa (Mawisa): good times
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): || React lenny for 18+ Mystic Messenger ||
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm gonna guess...
Jess (whoozica): Biru wants to see naked men
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I've already established MC's design is cute as fuck.

Jess (whoozica): NSFW MM gets released MC isn't even shown <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Mawisa): did you know one of the members of the insane clown posse goes to furry cons in a juggalo fursuit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *does Jaehee really shave Elizabeth the 3rd?*
Marisa (Mawisa): does she?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I'd be disappoint but I mean. It'd only be fair.
Marisa (Mawisa): animal abuse
Marisa (Mawisa): ||erik do u really wanna know||
Erik (Red Riot Thot): might as well tell me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm already on the Wiki
Jess (whoozica): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): wow
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~Also I'd be curious if Mystic Messenger 18+ would be more story driven and romantic than the typical lewd, cause 'you woke up one day and these 3 girls you know decided to become your maids' is not really. Romantic.~~
Marisa (Mawisa): ikr how could jaehee do such a thing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I thought you said there wasn't actual lesbian stuff because Korea
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but damn
