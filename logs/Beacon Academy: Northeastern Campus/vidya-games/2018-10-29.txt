Rebecca (madameterralupus): I really hate when I win a match in Amit y arena... and the person leaves before I can claim the winnings... 😡 like da fuq.
Marisa (Weeb): that is the absolute worst
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think you're supposed to still get your winnings even if that happens. Try refreshing the game?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷🏻‍♀️ i didn't that time and another time it happened.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m going to impulse buy one hero at some point. Do I get it for PC or switch tho?
