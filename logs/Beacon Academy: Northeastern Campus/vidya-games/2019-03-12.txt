Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yo we should have a tabletop/DnD chat
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I wanna talk about my characters and nerd about Critical Role and TAZ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I made a new character
Mark (Mad Doctor): *hopelessly old school gamer guy supports this idea*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I spent ALL WORK because there was nothing to do, writing back stories for my newer characters
Anna (loud and likely blonde): now i dont play DnD but OwO character backstory???
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes I have a human grave cleric who is a 12 year old boy named Vilro Ashenfell

And I have a Drow Earth Ashari Druid named Ereka Harsan 

Then there's my more developed character who I've been playing for a while named Wynira Diegoria
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ðŸ‘€ if u. ever wanna just infodump character backstories on me. I am. always intrigued
Mark (Mad Doctor): I have a halfling rogue who joined his party to find his clansmen, who have been sold into slavery by two of the campaign's villans (one of whom we've had to work with in the past, much to my character's disgust). We're two years in, and as my character is giving up on finding his people, he has started to fight with suicidal recklessness. A few sessions ago, he leaped onto the face of a red dragon to poke it in the eye. Recently, after an unsuccessful fight, he was reincarnated by a friendly elven shaman. He's still a halfling but now a Tallfellow female. This has prompted an identity crisis, and while part of him refuses to give up on his quest (hence the determination to hold onto old pronouns), part of him is temped to return home, retire, and build a new clan. At the end of our last session, our ship was approaching the Five Shires. I honestly have no idea what my PC is going to decide
