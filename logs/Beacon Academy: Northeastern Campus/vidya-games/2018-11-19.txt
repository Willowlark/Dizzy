you want fucking rwby chibi?: TTATT i want new pkmn game so bad
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I got Eevee clothes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@184437198865563648> is Eevee your main when battling? I'm wondering if your main gets more EXP during battles
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah. The exp rewards are spread well, the distance between them has stayed consistent.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If anything it’s the stat boosts given by defeating Pokémon.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): http://www.gamersheroes.com/game-guides/how-to-level-fast-in-pokemon-lets-go-eevee-pikachu/
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): EV yield has been removed from the game, you use the candies now.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've only used candies on Eevee, so makes sense.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wasted all that time trying to buff up Onix and Geodude to beat Surge only to have Eevee do it all on her own 😅
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eevee is so fucking powerful and such a GOOD GIRL.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Rest of my team feels pathetic.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I did a free trial of Switch gold, if you want that trade.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeet ok
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Me, riding piggyback on my golduck which is firing psybeam at anything that moves in lavender tower: <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): All to the Ghostbusters theme song.
Marisa (Weeb): lol they changed the old guy outside of the one gym who's looking in the window
instead of "this gym's great, it's full of cute girls!" he says "it's full of strong trainers!"
<:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Shit I forgot.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you battle with a traded Pokémon you get extra exp.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And since exp is shared to the team...
Marisa (Weeb): my eevee looks ridiculous and i love it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What's he wearing?
Marisa (Weeb): lots of things owo
Marisa (Weeb): i can't decide to get him a hat or let him go hatless
Marisa (Weeb): he has a mohawk tho
Marisa (Weeb): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wow what a nerd
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I love him
Marisa (Weeb): tfw you can't have glasses for yourself so you give your pokemon sight problems
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I wish there was more ways to customize your character. Like allowing you to choose skin, hair, and eye color individually... and add accessories
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH SERIOUSLY
they had all of that in past games, like hair style customization and more clothes and whatnot. i miss that.
Marisa (Weeb): but when they do a tail twitch for items is good
Marisa (Weeb): fun to watch
Marisa (Weeb): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Can't decide which I like more
Marisa (Weeb): Ooo the bottom is cuuute
Marisa (Weeb): 
Marisa (Weeb): Do all eevee have purple eyes? It’d be neat if they switched it up
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think so. Mine does
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, I just decided to keep the hat on because she looks too cute wearing it
Marisa (Weeb): which hat?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The default trainer hat
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Had to stay with hat myself.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): She a sporty girl
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also where do you get hair styles, I need.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Who eljoys kicking the shit out of other Pokémon
Marisa (Weeb): on the petting screen, use 2 or 5 fingers to pet their head
Marisa (Weeb): it'll change their hair
Marisa (Weeb): erik that's animal abuse
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://m.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-eevee/How_to_Change_Pikachu_and_Eevee%27s_Hairstyle
Marisa (Weeb): if you want an afro use 10 fingers
Marisa (Weeb): what did you name your eevee
Marisa (Weeb): what's the plural of eevee. eevee/eevees
Marisa (Weeb): did you know that eevee spelled backwards is also eevee. amazing.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My Eevee is named Summer
Marisa (Weeb): is that rwby based or do you just like the name
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was going to name her *Sunflower* but thought that was one too many syllables and I didn't like *Sunny* so it developed into *Summer*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So still, yes
Marisa (Weeb): e v o l u t i o n
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eri, short for Erika.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My sandslash and pikachu just aren’t leveling fast enough to be useful....
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My Eevee is at 30 and my next highest is like 22 or 23
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I guess that's the downfall of the exp share and not being able to battle wild Pokémon to target certain Pokémon to buff them
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've also had to start buying pokeballs because I've been running out
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And selling regular pokeballs and stocking up on great balls because the regular ones are becoming useless
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And i'm running low on berries
Marisa (Weeb): yeah the berries are the hardest to find imo
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Not like gen 3 when they were everywhere and actually visible and you could replant them to get more in the future
Marisa (Weeb): yeah!! let us plant berries!!!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t use the berries usually.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Marisa (Weeb): hhhhow you level 45 already omg
Marisa (Weeb): o probably i don't like catching pokemon lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just need sandslash and pikachu at viable combat level, which is around 40 going towards fuschia.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So here's some shitty game mechanics for ya, I made my way back to the forest and was struggling to catch a lvl 4 beedrill with a great ball...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Need to find Pokémon that give certain candies and binge catch, riding the catch combo. I want more defense and sp attack candy.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need a thunder stone to evolve my pikachu
Marisa (Weeb): kind of makes sense? did it give a lot of exp
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Allegedly one can be found on Rt 10
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have SHITTONS of quick candy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): From all the pidgey and rattata.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You can buy elemental stones in celadon.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve used a fire and ice stone.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): For My ninetales twins.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also the guy that gives you Eevee candy said you can get Pokémon specific candy by sending Pokémon to the ~~meat grinder~~ professor but it doesn't? Did I misunderstand him?
Marisa (Weeb): in the pokemon world there aren't really 'levels', that's just a mechanic to show progress in the game so it's neat if a pokemon in the beginner is equally as hard to catch later on as you level up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I bought great balls too, might use my 200+ pokeballs to grind catch combo later.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Maybe geodude, he gives defense candy when grinded.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But the reward for the difficulty isn’t there Mawisa.
Marisa (Weeb): self satisfaction? owo
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everyone but Eri needs levels.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ughh. I just want to get to fuchsia.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanna create a book of out of context trainer challenge lines.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > “Fork over all your cash when you lose to me kid”
> turns around
> It’s Ruby in a trainer outfit. 
> “are you... mugging me?”
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I love how Eevee intentional learns all the special moves that are “actually for humans”.
Marisa (Weeb): yeah i thought that was weird
i want my trainer to chop trees and start glowing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Erik you have a date.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): When do I get fly damnit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): At leas can do pogo transfers now.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): FUCK I could have fly already.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I gotta go to celadon.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): OwO a date with Beauty Sara? Hell yeah!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have fly now!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I actually think I have all the secret techniques.
Marisa (Weeb): i can't believe you can't gamble anymore. 0/10
Marisa (Weeb): eevee learns fly are you kidding
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and surf
Erik (Red Riot Thot): just whips out a surf board and starts surfing with you
Marisa (Weeb): and there are two snorlax!? i don't remember that. maybe i do. hm.
Marisa (Weeb): eevee is way too strong being able to know fire/water/electric/psychic/dark moves
Marisa (Weeb): i'm getting through this entire gym using only sizzly slide
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eevee busted.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Catch bonuses are confusing.
Marisa (Weeb): Geoduuuuuude
Marisa (Weeb): I wish regular meowth walked on four legs like in the anime
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lowkey, I might rename my Eevee *Yang* because she has purple eyes, a cowlick, and her best move is sizzly slide
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *do it*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): On a non pokemon related note, someone explain to me the difference between a pro and regular PS4.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There's a bundle deal for a ps4 slim with spider man, 200 bucks for black friday and I might see about getting a hold of it but I dunno if I need pro.
Halim (Greg): If it's like before one should have slightly better processing, graphics, and more hard drive
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WHY. Your math makes no sense game, why did I get three times the exp for what was the same geodude?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I spent all this time grinding him up, he’s pathetic.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Rip me.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm getting really tired of wasting 10+ great balls every time I try to catch a Pokémon 😒
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Only for them to run away
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Berries?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ultra balls?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just caught 30 psyduck so I can get special attack candy for my ninetwins.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Running low on berries and only just got my first ulta balls from an ace trainer. I'm currently in the rock cave
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also I got a Graveler I'd like to evolve at some point if you don't mind helping a brother out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah sure!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, I just had a thought. Since you can swap pokémon from your bag any time, does that mean you can swap out between Elite 4 battles?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Maybe.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): AUGH these combos make no sense!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sometimes I get 22x and others 5x.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): With the same bonuses.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fun fact, there’s a cap on how many Pokémon you can’t send at once.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Now to chain bell sprout to get attack boosts for Eri.
