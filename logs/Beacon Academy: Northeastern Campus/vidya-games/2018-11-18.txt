Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So Pokemon will still run. Lures seem to increase the level of the Pokémon that spawn. Pokemon can run whenever they want, not just after a throw.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Me: Ooo I just found a Chansey!
<@184437198865563648>: How the fuck did you find a Chansey in Mt. Moon?
Me: By chance
Marisa (Weeb): biru don't worry about going back for an onyx you can get one later
Marisa (Weeb): got my venusaur woooooo
Georgia (Something Sensible): i waited on fallout 76 because it looked possibly disappointing
Georgia (Something Sensible): IGN says its 4.3 out of 10
Georgia (Something Sensible): google users, only 51% liked it
Georgia (Something Sensible): meanwhile fallout 4 got a 9/10 and 91% liked it
Georgia (Something Sensible): O U C H
Matt (mattmyers25): It looks like it's fallout4 just with huge multiplayer
Matt (mattmyers25): I need to cancel my preorder for that game
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): LOL My weepingbell just chose not to faint because “it didn’t want me to be sad”.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): FUCK sandshrew is version exclusive.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanted one.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~and whose really going to buy pikachu~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Got chancy and Onix.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Isn't Onix wonderfully useless to ride?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It looks cool.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is useless though.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > 4 grunts come out and threaten to beat me up
> NPC shows up and “handles” three of them while I fight one cause ganging up on me is unforgivable. 
> me: please let them gang up on me, that’s more exp for my over leveled Eevee.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I put so much effort into getting an onix in mt moon; there’s two the minute I get into rock tunnel.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Graveler and goldbat too.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Were there always so many evolved mons running around?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If I’m the mad collector Bill, Erik’s Pokésona is Black Belt Erik.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): FUCK
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I accidentally didn't let eevee learn swift
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I had to exit without saving
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Luckily I wasn't that far into picking up where I left off
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I didn’t give her swift.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Her accuracy is good enough as it, headbutt from TM has better damage and can cause flinching.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I 100% thing Go is a success though.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The catching and exp share mechanics make the game less grindy and more fun to play.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Agreed
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I named my  Vulpix Pyrrha because she’s also bathed in flames frequently, her final form is clothed in white, and she cursed*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *also incredibly humble*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I found one in rock tunnel and one shot’d her team~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh in case you haven't figured out yet, if a wild pokémon is glowing blue, it's tiny and if it's glowing red it's huge
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What level was the Squirtle you got from the person?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 16?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok because I just caught a wild one and it was 9. Just deciding if it's worth leveling up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Traditionally yes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Before Pokémon would actually get more stats based on what Pokémon they fought.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I dunno how that works with catching wilds.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh shit I think you can teach all three of those moves from that guy to your Eevee
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That would make her super versatile
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not incredibly so.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): For example, nothing would help against electric.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): True
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm learning how super useful Bulbasaur actually is
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Hit your opponent with a leech seed and poison powder and your opponent will take multiple hits of damage with each turn
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve got my weepinbell.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leaf stone to evolve it eventually.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Most of my fights end too quickly to use status damage.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need a dark type for lavender town tho.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Guess that gives me a reason to heyo Alolan Ratatta
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): NEVERMIND I screwed up.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Psychic is super on ghost.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need a psychic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pretty close to a goldduck.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Just got an Abra
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I got a PORYGON.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve never had one in a main series game!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Celadon has more Eevee specials. Dark and psychic.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): When you’re on the stone shop floor Eevee says she’s doesn’t want to evolve.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Disappointed in my pidgeot and Vulpix’s performance v Erika.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eevee is too strong, rest of team seems weak in comparison.
Marisa (Weeb): Celadon doesn’t have human clothes in the store and I am anger but at least you can get team rocket clothes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): haven't gotten them yet.
