Erik (Red Riot Thot): So Jeremy from Achievement Hunter is streaming Jackbox and the way he did it was post the first 3 letters or the code and his viewers had to guess the last letter to make it in the game and I thought that was a clever way to do that
Marisa (Mawisa): A lot of streamers do that! I forget how it started but Ray does it also, and the Game Grumps do it. Much easier and fairer than having a billion fans all try and rush in at the same time. It still fills super quickly.
