Georgia (Something Sensible): Rutgers league club has a shortage of top laners and if that doesnt say something
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): its interesting tho 
cause Support is the least popular role
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): like thats why you can either do Fill or Support to get out of the Autofill queue

Tom (tomukuncosplay): I'd play tonight but I'm still on a business trip ðŸ˜’
