Mark (Mad Doctor): Re: earlier discussion about BNE D&D: would anyone be interested in a play-by-post game? For those unfamiliar, it's like D&D mixed with creative writing. Generally, combat gets simplified and abstracted, but role-playing and character development can get a lot deeper. And, of course, live action sessions would be possible when we assembled
Matt (mattmyers25): I would be intrested
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Been running them for a year and a half.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'd be into that
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ok, I'll set up a forum game and post here when it's ready.  Simple starting concept: protect a village from the dangers around it and solve the mysteries behind those dangers. I have an idea for an additional wrinkle I will throw in with players permission
