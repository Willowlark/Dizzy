Erik (Red Riot Thot): My friend wants to start a new mini campaign with our group with new characters so I used a DnD character generator. This is what I came up with
Georgia (Something Sensible): What a charismatic orc
Mark (Mad Doctor): Meat is once again on the menu, gentlemen. Might I recommend a Cabernet Sauvignon?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): No hes aggressive tho so like. " *I HIGHLY suggest* the Cabernet Sauvignon"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~serves hors d'oeuvres from my rapier~*
