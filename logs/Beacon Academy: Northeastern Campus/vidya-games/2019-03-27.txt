Mark (Mad Doctor): I have set up a game titled "BNE D&D" on gamersplane.com, a free play-by-post website.  Direct link to the game is below, but I think you have to make an account and submit a character to enter it (make sure character is designated 5E D&D. No need to enter anything yet. I'd prefer to get a group together before we got into character creation..  I will run the game if we get three people, would prefer 4-6, can run with up to 8.
