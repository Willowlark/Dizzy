Marisa (Weeb): are regional pokemon a thing in this new game? like in past games pokemon each had a region in the world they originated from (tied to the trainer who caught it) and it was easier to get a shiny egg with a japanese region pokemon or something. vivillon also had different wings depending where in the world it originated
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yes, there are game specific pokemon
Marisa (Weeb): nono not game specific, location specific
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oooooooh
Erik (Red Riot Thot): no clue
