Erik (Red Riot Thot): They heard our complaints. We're getting a new game mode üôåüèª
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh it's not the stuff they already added?

~~Ten dollars it's a battle royal mode OwO~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They didn't add a new game mode because it was a "miscommunication" when they announced it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So is this new DLC past the PJs and the time skip outfits?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Or is this including the PJs and Timeskip outfits?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm guessing the new DLC for XBOX and PS is the PJ and timeskip outfits? I'm not sure if they got the update when PC did
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Grimm eclipse is a wash tho. Blazblue is a better RWBY game.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I want them to just make a legit RWBY fighting game tho

Like the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm or the My Hero One Justice fighting games
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like, I'd buy the fuck out of that.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also I thought they were gonna add more RWBY charaacters to Crosstag...I'm disappointed there's not Pyrrha or Nora.
