Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the bunny is confirmed furry bait again xD, it's jacks favorite
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Hah! See I'm not a furry cause it's not my favorite ðŸ˜› I don't take the bait~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~no one even brought up you being a furry, does that mean furry things were already on your mind?~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *it's the middle of the day Rebecca, GAWD*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~everyone likes to claim I'm one soo :P~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Fire fighting bait again
