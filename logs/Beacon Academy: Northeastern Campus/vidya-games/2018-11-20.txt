Erik (Red Riot Thot): There's a woman in Lavender town named Diggette and all I can think of is a Diglet wearing the fucking Peach crown
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Got both Ninetails and evolved my Pikachu <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YEET
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I also spent 10,000 on sunglasses
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But I got the black ones and I can't tell if she looks cool or blind
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I got a bunch of attack candy earlier I need to give to Eevee.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Things to use your pokeballs for; catching scrub Pokémon for combo and grinding candy/exp.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ice Ninetails is pretty badass
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm currently going through the Erika gym, and as a trainer with a fire type preference, it's a breeze so far
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup. I ran through... I used pidgeot.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Vulpix hasn’t evolved yet.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is my lineup for Erika
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You might want to balance your team a bit lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh I swap out based on who I'm fighting
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Aaaah kk.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t try to keep more than 6 up to snuff.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Beautiful
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That was easy. One-hit K.O.'d her first two with each of my Ninetails. That mega drain fucked up my ice one, but Eevee, being the good girl she is, finished her off
Marisa (Weeb): the power of love is too strong, my eevee and venusaur are practically invincible because of it. they shrug off any status ailment like it's nothing and eevee avoided a KO just by sheer desire to stay alive for me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My Eevee has shrugged off poisoning through the power of love
Marisa (Weeb): mine's powered through everything; poison, paralysis, sleep, burn. haven't been frozen yet but we'll see.
waking up for me is the ultimate sign of love
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Question: what would stop someone from having a good high level team, beating the game, then trading that team to a newer player who would have an OP team and professionally level *them* up until they beat the game and continue the cycle until the Pokemon reach their max level (if available)?
Marisa (Weeb): pokemon not listening to the new trainer if they're over a certain level
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ah
Halim (Greg): Yeah 
When pokemon get over a certain level they dont listen to you unless you have enough badges in the original games
Halim (Greg): I tried doing that by trading a level 60 pokemon to a new game
Halim (Greg): It resulted in me sitting through really long battles while I waited for my pokemon to either listen to me or for them to faint as a result of losing like 4 hp a high from my opponents
Halim (Greg): League of Legends anybody? 0w0
Halim (Greg): <@351785752197201920> ? OwO
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I must do a bed 🙏
Halim (Greg): Oks 
Sleep well man
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): How I look when I’m happy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eevee shows compatible with elemental stones. ~~But my sweet daughter can be whatever she wants and that’s final~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Have you encountered any wild Eevee yet?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup. Pokémon road.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): West of celadon.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It... feels wrong to use any Eevee other than my Eri though, so no Eeveelutions this game.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You know what's going to be sad? After we beat the game and decide if we want to play again... and start over... with a new Eevee
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): NEVER.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve never restarted a Pokémon game though. Too attached to my team, don’t care enough for the gameplay.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I like that ace trainers are generally harder to fight.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like, the name makes sense.
Marisa (Weeb): asexual trainers represent
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~also fem ace trainer design is 👌~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Koga is such a narutard.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Catch chaining anything higher than level 15 seems difficult.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!386874959009415170> <@!301927856240459777> so have either of you seen a break down of how bonus multiplier is calculated? Cause it makes NO sense.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WOW according to reddit the legendary birds spawn in the wild.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: apparently wild eevee and the starter eevee look different
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Confirmed.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Partner Eevee is more tan than brown.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412429742374125570/514319749270994954/image0.png ya, also the eyes stood out to me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My team. Finally got raichu up to area levels so I can lay off, the rest of the team on point.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Catch combos do good work. Raichu leveled 6 or 7 times in the last hour.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also have a rapidash I can ride and that’s AWESOME.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Our teams are 67% the same
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lol.
