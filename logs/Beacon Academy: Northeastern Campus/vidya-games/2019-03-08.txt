Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I redownloaded Animal Crossing Pocket Camp because that used to be a thing. I'm still wearing a Santa hat and my campsite is decorated for *Christmas 2017*
Jess (whoozica): i played that game for 2 days
Marisa (Mawisa): Did you redownload it because of the big update :3c
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's what reminded me that it existed lol
