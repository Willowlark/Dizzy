Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay so playing the BNHA Fighting game and Bakugo is OP as fuck
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So is Denki for some reason
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Really? I think Denki is one of those that in the right hands he's great cause he has hella delay in his moves 

But I was also playing a mid range charatver while fightunv him so
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I fought him and could never get any moves in because he kept stunning me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Over
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And over
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And over...
