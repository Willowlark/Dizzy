Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Sooooo I think I ignored the prompt to do silph co.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): The levels are lower than Blaine and koga.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oops.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lol yeah because I think that's where I'm at currently
Erik (Red Riot Thot): In Saffron?
Marisa (Weeb): Gotta go fast
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Mmhmm.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need that, Sabrina, then Giovanni.
Marisa (Weeb): If you didn't do silph co how'd you get the pokeflute to wake up snorlax?
Marisa (Weeb): o wait did they give that at the casino
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thatâ€™s from lavender tower.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): I really donâ€™t want to wander silph. Ugh.
Marisa (Weeb): yeah but to go to the top of the tower you need the scope
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): OwO
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): I got a key stone.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Mega evolutions.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): You get free mega stones for the starters. Not Eevee, the normal ones.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): All badges acquired.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™ve got three PokÃ©mon at 60+, rest around that.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Damn
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): lets go isn't hard, but has been fun.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Though now I'm kinda like 'get on with it'.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@184437198865563648> did you finally get to bring your PokÃ©mon Go PokÃ©mon yet?
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™ve had the option, havenâ€™t tried.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Saffron City is annoying because the Gym is at the very northern point and the Pokecenter is at the very southern part...
