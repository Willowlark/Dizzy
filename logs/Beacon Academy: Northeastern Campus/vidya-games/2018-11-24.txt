Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Some bitch tried to tell me her Eevee was better than Eri*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~10 levels under hers or not, thatâ€™s *unforgivable*.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Eri won though. Cause she a beautiful bean who I love.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm at that point where I really have to narrow down my team and focus on leveling them properly because I attempted to go to Sabrina and the first gym trainer had PokÃ©mon at level 41+ and Eevee is my only 40+ PokÃ©mon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I don't want to just rely on her for every single battle
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Are you using candies?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No but I should because I have a bunch
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This is a thing now.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So the candies are key, your PokÃ©mon will be weak if you donâ€™t use them.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I got the leveling I needed while doing a catch chain to get candy of particular type.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I did 25 Geodude for defense candy... Ponyta for attack... psyduck for special attack....
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It went fairly quickly and gets good exp.
