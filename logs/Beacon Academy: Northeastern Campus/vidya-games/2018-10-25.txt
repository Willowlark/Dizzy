Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nice it's voiced.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~If the reason the characters are in the game is they'll be in the next vytal festival; does that mean there's a canon game in BNHA where class 1-A are the characters; because they'll be in the next sports festival?~~
Erik (slendergiant): Did you mean: http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/My_Hero_One%27s_Justice
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ^
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ~~that reminds me my preorder should be coming in any day now~~
Jess (whoozica): omg what, i had no idea this existed
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But is the game canon that it's a game about the characters?
Erik (slendergiant): Oh shit yeah it comes out tomorrow
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I guess I can play that now~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My favorite voice line is Ruby saying "YeAH let's break stuff"
Jess (whoozica): <@!351785752197201920>  srry give up on soul cal, im getting this. ðŸ˜‚
you want fucking rwby chibi?: <:kin:404772642952839168>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ah, victory keys are the shitty mechanic to keep you from enjoying the game <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (slendergiant): yup
Erik (slendergiant): ~~I'd rather it be like Loot Boxes in Overwatch~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~They're still loot boxes~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Just loot boxes you can only get 1 of every 3 hours.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): huh. Do I use my usually gaming screennames...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): or tlt_wm cause anyone I play this with is probs from instagram. ðŸ˜‚
Erik (slendergiant): Ok I'm not winning anymore. Probably gonna quit soon ðŸ˜›
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~You can make your own academy~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~We can make BeaconNortheast~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~oof you need 1000 lien~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Did you get auto assigned to Mistral?
Erik (slendergiant): I got auto assigned to Vale
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I think the ~~guilds~~ Academies are region locked. You do get a free relocation though.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So we need a group region and we can make the academy.
Erik (slendergiant): There's an academy called "the bee hive"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): should it just be vale? probably.
Erik (slendergiant): probs
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Done~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I have no idea how to add friends on this stupid thing tho~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~me neither~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~requested to join BNE~~
Marisa (Weeb): oh the bnha game has some really funny dialogue between characters when they do combos
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): @everyone There's an academy for `BeaconNortheast` on the Vale region (if you get assigned to a different region you can relocate in your profile). You can search for the Academy and it shows up.

No idea how to add individual friends yet.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: wh, what game are u talking abt-
Jess (whoozica): amity arena i think?
you want fucking rwby chibi?: sou desu ne.......
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I can expel Erik lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): but I can't friend him.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: looks funky
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): nothing says United States like Korean.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Well that was a good waste of my first hour working.
Jess (whoozica): is it free?
Erik (slendergiant): ye
Jess (whoozica): ðŸ†“
you want fucking rwby chibi?: fuck yeah
you want fucking rwby chibi?: "allow RWBY to make phone calls?" i dont know why team rwby needs to make phone calls but ok
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i love having games in my phone that i only bingeplay once a month /joke
Erik (slendergiant): Oh btw I have a thing I got at RTX that gives you a Nora card so I'll throw a pic of that up in the group when I get home
you want fucking rwby chibi?: oh this is like cookie wars
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how do you select an academy
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): tab on the far right.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
you want fucking rwby chibi?: oh my god how long is the tutorial why have you doomed me
Marisa (Weeb): ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Marisa (Weeb): after 50 hours they put me in mistral
Marisa (Weeb): that was torture
Marisa (Weeb): and it explained nothing about how to play
Erik (slendergiant): Place characters on the field and hope for the best
Erik (slendergiant): That's the basic gist
Marisa (Weeb): but u gotta ~strategize~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i play another game like this so i just. place strong characters on the field and hope for the best! like erik said lmao
Georgia (Something Sensible): Full army of Pyrrhas
you want fucking rwby chibi?: also i got dropped in atlas
Marisa (Weeb): oh man luna nova is an academy
Erik (slendergiant): my downfall is having characters that are close range fighters but they get distracted by enemy characters that they don't bother with the turrets
Erik (slendergiant): and I'm just like YANG LEAVE THEM ALONE YOU'RE MY TANK
Marisa (Weeb): [bangs on door to the academy] let me in
you want fucking rwby chibi?: [also bangs on the doors] let us in
Marisa (Weeb): i just destroyed someone on pvp i feel bad
Marisa (Weeb): their raven card kept getting me tho
Marisa (Weeb): that was cool
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): All three of you are added
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like It's a shitty mobile game yeah.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~but my tolerance for crappy games is much higher when it's RWBY based~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~cough grimm eclipse~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~blaz blue~~
Marisa (Weeb): i didn't realize the play for fun was with people and i got destroyed while testing out all the emojis this is highly embarassing
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ripppp
Erik (slendergiant): I can tell getting coins is going to be annoying because I've been getting like 2-5 in my crates
Marisa (Weeb): someone sent an emoji and disconnected 3 seconds before i was going to win and i didn't get any trophies for it
Marisa (Weeb): broken game
Marisa (Weeb): i'm bloodthirsty now
Marisa (Weeb): now this person isn't doing anything. fite me.
ZombieHunter: I got Vacuo >.>
ZombieHunter: If you go to inbox <@!386874959009415170>  thereâ€™s a free 1000
you want fucking rwby chibi?: funky rwby game show me how to add friends
Marisa (Weeb): on your profile you can switch your region to vale and then serach in the academy tab
Erik (slendergiant): ~~already blew it on buffing my characters~~
Marisa (Weeb): ehhh h
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): <@184437198865563648> request sent
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): is anyone `Disastwrwolf1`?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): or `Alec759`?
Erik (slendergiant): This game is bullshit. How is my opponent able to put down like 5 characters at once?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): cheap characters?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): .....what pissed me off was that people would lose
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and then leave before the match was over
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so i could never get a crate
Erik (slendergiant): I tried leaving a game because it was glitching and then when I restarted the game it threw me back in
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): rip
Erik (slendergiant): so I just threw emotes at them until time ran out
Erik (slendergiant): It's also very buggy. I play one round and then any time after that I get an error that says try again later
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah, losing interest REAL QUICK
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I just played a game and they did absolutely nothing.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Does it not show you the card screen every time?
Erik (slendergiant): like at the end?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeah.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Or do you not get crates in fame mode?
Erik (slendergiant): it ends, freezes, and then says that the battle has ended and sends me back to the lobby
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ^
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I got that yeah.
Erik (slendergiant): and then I have to close the app and restart it to play another match
Erik (slendergiant): might be an overloaded server issue like when Pokemon Go was released and no one could play
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'll come back to it later maybe.
