Erik (Red Riot Thot): Do I give my rival a normal name or do I go with the classic "Asshole" 🤔
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Never mind. Can't use swear words
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Did y'all get a male or female Eevee?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Female.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Same
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Caught a Pikachu. Now it's like I have both games!
Marisa (Weeb): I got a boy eevee but I heard it’s random
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Maybe it gives you the opposite gender of your character? (Assuming you chose a girl and Bill chose a boy)
Marisa (Weeb): People were saying you can see the gender as soon as you start the game (it’s based on whatever eevee jumps out of the TV) so people soft resetted to get what they wanted
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh true
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok so I'm noticing in addition to money, you get pokeballs after winning battles. Is this to get you to catch pokémon to gain experience instead of battling wild pokémon?
Marisa (Weeb): I think so yeah. I just got to a point where I have to catch a ton of Pokémon because I was only catching new ones but if you have a certain number you can get free Pokémon from people
Marisa (Weeb): Just got 50 wew
Marisa (Weeb): Apparently that’s still not enough aaaa
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah it’s so you can keep catching.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eevee’s tail white section has a heart shape if she’s a girl.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yup
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Same with Pikachu
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have one of each lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): How is it that I can defeat Brock with a Bellsprout and an Eevee but I can't defeat the stupid trainer's fucking Bulbasaur
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Leech seed is a cheap fucking move
Marisa (Weeb): yeah he was good. misty was also surprisingly strong
Marisa (Weeb): oh but i turned down an electric move that probably would've make it super easy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have two pikachu ready for Misty lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Just need a fire type for that bulbasaur 😒
Marisa (Weeb): how about bug
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Hmm didn't try other than my useless Metapod...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Gotta swap a Weedle in there maybe
Marisa (Weeb): bug eat grass
bug is strong against grass. also flying i think.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah my Pidgey was doing alright until leech seed fucked him over
Marisa (Weeb): years of avoiding grass has messed me up
Marisa (Weeb): a lifetime of avoiding it and now it's fine
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I haven’t had a single fight go longer than four rounds.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m in mt moon.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just caught a pokemon by accidentally dropping my joycon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Holy shit how far are you already?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I haven’t used anyone but Eevee except for one double battle.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mt moon is right after Brock lol.
Marisa (Weeb): i'm at the SS Anne but i'm exploring before getting on it
Marisa (Weeb): o yeah there's snorlax so i'm heading back
Marisa (Weeb): HOLY FUDGE MISTER MIME WALKING AROUND IS TERRIFYING
Marisa (Weeb): mr mime, clefable, and onyx are literal nightmares
Marisa (Weeb): at least it's fairy type
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t really get Coach trainers, are they just special cause you get stuff?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Swapping my bugs did nothing because they're too weak 😑
Marisa (Weeb): ya they're like little bonuses
i like that this game doesn't excessively hold your hand like recent ones
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): HAHAHA I just walked into a house and a girl gave me a bulbasaur.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nice.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think they're to help you train your pokémon since you can't just go in the wild for hours, leveling your pokémon up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Can you re challenge team?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Idk probs not
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I can't beat this one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There better be a battling mechanic though, like a battle tower or something.
Marisa (Weeb): yeah i was like "i already have a bulbasaur lady pls"
the charmander dude won't give it to me tho
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just have to battle them until they slowly kill all of my pokemon...
Marisa (Weeb): tfw sailor shorts but no sailor skirt
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): While constant exp share and only catching is less grindy than the old games, I’ll miss battling. Eventually.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~unless I curbstomb everything.~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fucking finally
Marisa (Weeb): i love blue
Marisa (Weeb): [gary theme song plays] smell ya later
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My Eevee dodged a leech seed and got him with three tackles
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That was lucky as shit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I named my rival Gary so I'm glad Gary is named Blue lol
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH i was gonna do gary but i named him Trace because i googled it and people said his name was trace
Marisa (Weeb): watch that be someone else rip
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I tried naming him Fuckface
Marisa (Weeb): and now you're in jail
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah they banned my Trainer Club account
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~kidding~~
Marisa (Weeb): Uhh
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, I completely forget my login for Pokemon Go. Luckily I was signed it on my tablet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Guy turns into rocket grunt and asks to recruit me
> gets frustrated cause I’m refusing
> *maybe if I had a dialogue option I’d consider it*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Idk the dude I just fought had growlithe and I want.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hahahaha I got the charmander too Mawisa.
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH I WAS TRYING TO JOIN i'm pretty sure in the original you could join
Marisa (Weeb): it gave you the option
Marisa (Weeb): how'd you get the charmander??? i grinded to get 60 pokemon for it and he wouldn't let me
Marisa (Weeb): can't get squirtle either. rigged.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Where are you getting the starters?
Marisa (Weeb): people offer them to you
Marisa (Weeb): or i caught my bulbasaur in viridian forest
Marisa (Weeb): second son
Marisa (Weeb): i wanna find where you can catch wild eevees so i can make an eevee team
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 68.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So you were close.
Marisa (Weeb): though, can you can anything that isn't flareon/jolteon/vaporeon?
Marisa (Weeb): are the others in this too
Marisa (Weeb): "hey here's my team of 1 eevee and 5 sylveon"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Through Pokémon go transfer, probably.
Marisa (Weeb): are leaf glace and sylveon are in go yet?
Marisa (Weeb): my grammar is horrible now
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nah they aren’t.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Double kick is best move.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Unless it's against bug Pokémon
Marisa (Weeb): really? my double kick sucks it doesnt do anything. i rely on quick attack to destroy.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Double kick just kicked a Meowth's ass for me but did jack shit against a Kakuna
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Double kick is super effective on rock and normal.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bugs will get crushed with quick attack or bite.
Marisa (Weeb): i got rid of bite for sizzly slide
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What the fuck even is that move. Never heard of any of those.
Marisa (Weeb): new eevee move owo
Marisa (Weeb): i also got bouncy bubble but not buzzy buzz
Marisa (Weeb): good names
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There's a Meowth sleeping on top of the cave entrance to Mt. Moon
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH ain't he cute
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh it's Team Rocket's
Marisa (Weeb): he's doing his best
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The cut scenes are fantastic and make me love Eevee even more.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also I like that they’re leaning into manga canon somewhat.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I love playing with my Eevee 😭
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So Bill, is this what we're going to be doing on the ferry? 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s a 10 minute ride so you won’t do much lol.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lol gotcha
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Watch for the shake remote icon to show up, Eevee does special reactions.
Marisa (Weeb): Aww really? Tablet mode pls
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It may show up anyway.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Just different input.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): TAIL FIVE FOR DAYS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This is the icon.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh I can’t go back to mt moon.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What did you need from there?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanted to try and find an onix.
Marisa (Weeb): Never seen that
THAT not being able to go back until fly sucks
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Welp, guess i'm gonna wander Mt. Moon until I find one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Some things about the new game mechanics I enjoy are that your poisoned pokémon don't take damage when you're walking anymore and that caves are no longer as dreadful to wander through
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah! They also kept the thing where if you have a really strong bond, your Pokémon will just shrug off the poison and cancel it out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YAS Vulpix acquires.
Marisa (Weeb): O you at the daycare already
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Just about. Curbstomped misty.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Holy shit my Paras just fucked up a Geodude with a poison powder and a single absorb
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!301927856240459777> I got the squirtle too.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm wondering if you need to use a lure to get the Onyx
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You can buy them in vermillion so don’t be worried about saving them.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have one. I shall try it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Tomorrow
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because I really need to go to bed lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~What is this *bed* you speak of. Sleep if for the week lol~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): About to myself.
Marisa (Weeb): Tfw can’t Pokémon cuz you gotta teach. I tried to talk Pokémon with my student he was just like “lol”
Marisa (Weeb): 
Marisa (Weeb): what level and CP do your eevees have? i feel like mine is a little low
Marisa (Weeb): though judging it says it has AMAZING STATS. doubt.
Halim (Greg): Amazing stats refers to the IVs and not CP
Marisa (Weeb): that's why eevee and pikachu are so OP. full IVs
