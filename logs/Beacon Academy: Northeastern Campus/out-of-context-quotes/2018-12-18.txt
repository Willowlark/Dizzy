Mark (Mad Doctor): From her first day at her new school:

Audrey: "Hi, my name is Audrey, and I like anime."
Classmate: "Yeah, do you like Naruto?"
Audrey: "Not really to my taste"
Classmate: "How about Dragon Ball Z?"
Audrey: "Don't really care for it"
Classmate: "Then you're not really an anime fan"
Audrey: "Bitch, hold my beer..."

(Note that she was able to establish her nerd cred and got two kids into the Love Live fandom)
Jess (whoozica): OOF you show em Audrey!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): GOOD IM PROUD OF HER
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good for Audrey! :D
~~And I'll never understand why people think Naruto and DBZ are the factor of liking anime. Like not all anime fans watch them...~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Atta Girl!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Naruto and dbz are the two most mainstream anime to date so that’s why ppl always use those. Although I’m not a fan of either 🤷🏼‍♀️
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Trueeee ~~People just like constantly yelling I guess lol~~
