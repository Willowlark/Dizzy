Georgia (Something Sensible): Do we wanna ditch the inktober chat? Also wondering if we should do a check that people are still active?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Was always the intention to ditch inktober. Can't help lurkers.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Not like a “react to this post or you’re BANNED” but I’m curious to see how many active members we have in the course of a week, and maybe check in with anyone who doesn’t end up answering?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m mostly just spitballing because I know 2019 will bring more members for sure, so if anyone wants out, it’s good to do sooner rather than later
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): well... most people are satisfied with the size of BNE.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Now, do I think David and maybe the Jessies should be in BNE, absolutely. But BNE has settled into a position of 'friends-but-not-close-friends' and that's a thin line. Too many people, we lose that and it becomes a server half full of randoms. Too few, it becomes tighter knit but that not an option. 

I just know in discussions I've had people are happy with the size as is, and the atmo we got.
Halim(Greg)(jake)(Ent)(Not greg): eh i see no reason to worry about lurkers
Halim(Greg)(jake)(Ent)(Not greg): the active people will be active, having inactive members doesn't hurt anything and lets people get back in whenever they want
