Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And I do apologize if I implied anything to offend you as well. It was not my intention to if I did my friend.
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm not offended by anything you're implying about me 

I'm a bit frustrated for sure
Cause I'm sorry if you guys want to be democratic and talk thats fine but if thats the case, 
maybe don't have a discussion on your own, come to a conclusion, and THEN ask me about it in a pm?  
Like most of the time I don't have a problem with whatever you guys are thinking anyways, 
but doing that makes me feel like I have no real say in the matter anyways, 
especially since like
I made the admin chat for a reason 
You and Georgia can use it? 
like we all could have very easily talked in admin while the entirety of the Ethan shitshow went down? 
theres a big difference between "hey we all talked about this as a group, took a vote, and this was our result"
and "Hey georgia and I talked and want to do this,  just figured i'd check in as a courtesy"
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ffs don't use dizzy to comment at me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ooooh shit sorry.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s an auto response.
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s for Ethan’s name dropping.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): See?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ethan
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Ethan?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lol Ethan indeed.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: did you turn it off
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): “For Ethan”
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: For Ethan
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Err. I guess the quotes broke it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Or the capital. Duck.
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: for Ethan
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fuck.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ah
Dizzy: Biru says just tell him no already...
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: for Ethan
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need to disable that tho.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Anyway!
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the Ethan
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Let me clarify, Georgia and I did not discuss elsewhere. In following the chat at the time I had gotten the feeling we were going to far as a group. That’s why I made that call for everyone to ceasefire, and after that I weighed it in my head alone (on the subway even, no signal), I asked Georgia and you in DMs if you agreed to preserve Casey’s feelings over letting people own their words about her fiancée. There was no discussion, just me confirming.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We don’t use this channel much so I didn’t think of it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can see how that would make you feel we were deciding behind your back, and I’m sorry about giving you that impression. I DM’d you in the first place because I DID want your opinion.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If I didn’t, I would have wiped it myself. 😛
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So if anything, I made that call myself and confirmed with you both individually. It was unanimously agreed on so we didn’t need to discuss. Your opinion was respected, valid, and appreciated. Sorry that got lost in translation.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Agreed with the stance, maybe we should have a “Da Rulez” to ensure that this doesn’t happen again, even if it’s just a loose “no hate, no whatever” kinda deal
Georgia (Something Sensible): We can mull over that kinda thing, I’m too focused on midterms to really either way
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think making another channel was kinda redundant to what Bill said after wiping vent-support, but if you think it made an impact, then sure
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve been thinking about some kind community guidelines as well, but let’s address that at a later date. I’m a bit stretched with work and some other stuff right now.
