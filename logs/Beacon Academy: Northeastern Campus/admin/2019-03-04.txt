Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hal, it would have been appreciated if you shared your stance with the rest of us first... we’ve been admining as a group all through BNE’s existence and you going off on your own undermines that. It’s not that I disagree with you, I said so much that you need to be responsible for what you say online in my blurb during the deletion. But admin actions and “rulings” have been democratic before and changing that will change status quo around here. It’s a group of friends, not a hierarchy.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Sorry, you know me. Unpredictable and all.  
I know this isn't a hierarchy, I'm not trying to rearrange the way things run  here 
Forgive me this one time I decided to admin things to create a channel and address a problem and reaffirm something you also said without having to hide it within the hour.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t think you are Hal, promise.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s only an impression.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t believe the impression, because I know you better than that.
