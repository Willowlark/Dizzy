Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Created this so that way we can talk about any channel modifications or roles or organization whatever
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Also cause BNE is kinda large (about 30 people, and i wouldnt be surprised if it continued to grow a bit) so an admin chat would be handy
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Things on the docket to discuss: redundant channel removal, channel organization, and potential channel ideas
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Of course we put these things up to a vote later in announcements but yeah
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So on the matter of redundant channels 
The Mystic Messenger channel that only 4... 5 people? Are in 
I propose either deleting it, (since it doesnt get much use) or at least removing its restricted access 
Idk why its restricted access to begin with tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): Itâ€™s kinda not used... it was a trend there when Erik started playing it but it hasnâ€™t seen much action lately anyways
Georgia (Something Sensible): Iâ€™m good with putting it to a vote to delete
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Yeah 
I think the vote should be put in the chat itself not in announcements tho
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cause its restricted and pnly 6 people have access to it?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Of which you, bill, and I are 3
Georgia (Something Sensible): O rly itâ€™s just 6? Honestly we could just ditch it if thatâ€™s the case
Georgia (Something Sensible): I donâ€™t think Marisa or Jess or Erik will be too upset
Georgia (Something Sensible): The chat doesnâ€™t see any action nowadays
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They won't.
