Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was looking at the camera specs; two things to be aware of are your phone actually takes “bigger” pictures than that camera (that doesn’t really matter unless you’re making prints or want to zoom REALLY far in after the fact) and that camera apparently doesn’t work with newer sd cards, so don’t get a 128 big boi, it might not be compatible. 

But even with those, I think it’s so much nicer to use a camera versus a phone for photography. It makes it feel more “real” when you look through a viewfinder and such. Welcome to the camera club 📸
