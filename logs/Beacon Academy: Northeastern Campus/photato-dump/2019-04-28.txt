Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@&472064763145224227> but Nikon specifically Nikon US's 'Capture the Savings' event offers instant savings on cameras, kits and lenses   http://www.dpreview.com/news/7784202916/nikon-s-capture-the-savings-event-offers-instant-savings-on-dozens-of-cameras-lenses
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Where the $20 DSLR kits at
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You’ll receive it right after you sign your soul to the devil.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~wait the D750 is actually 1000 off at b&h, those instant savings aren’t everything~~
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Still $1700 everybody get your go fund mes up and running
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lol.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I opened a kofi that one time.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though even if the FX bodies are cheap... Nikon is moving to Z mount on the mirror less bodies and I dunno if they’ll keep releasing new FX for the dslrs...
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Could buy a car for the cost of a camera
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did you want a DSLR? For some reason I had the thought you were partial to your point and shoot.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~because of it's stupidly long zoom~~
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Point and shoot is the best I can get, I tried to get a DSLR but they’re all way above my price range
I do love the zoom tho <:fingerguns:453385855470534657> 
If I had a DSLR I don’t think I could use it properly
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Even rentals. Tokyo has rental cameras and they’re like the cost of my monthly rent
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You know I have half a dozen, admittedly older, DSLRs I'd loan you right?
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): I’d break them
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): I can’t be trusted
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My photographer friend is moving to Georgia ( <:fingerguns:453385855470534657> ) and was emptying his basement of gear so he gave me em.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You would not, I can trust you, and will trust you.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Bold of you to assume I can be trusted with more than a plastic fork
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Bold you you to tell me who to trust with what*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): how nice of you to donate pizza to the church service in our office
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i know nothing about churches
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Mirrorless cameras can take pictures of vampires right
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ~~despite owning a camera I know nothing about them~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): facts.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): if the camera has silver elsewhere in its build maybe not?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What's the model of your camera Marisa?
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): that's a good question
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i also don't know if it has silver in it but probably
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~the coolpix w300 is waterproof and probably way better than a gopro for CCE shinanigans~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): actually tell me your camera model Marisa.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i'm at work right now and my camera is under my pillow at home <:rip:378273525804433408>
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i have a gopro
