Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Photography is important to all of us...
ZombieHunter: It is. I know. What I mean is the popularity of my IG and its representation of me is specifically important for my photography and work.
ZombieHunter: You donâ€™t rely on photography. I work 2 days a week for 6 an hour. Photography now pays for my cons.
Marisa (Mawisa): i use photoshoots to pay for cons but when you're a cosplayer people don't tag you because then it seems like you're the cosplayer in the pic ;u;
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I see what you mean, with the clarification. Thank. Your making your instagram your portfolio and you want it to speak for your quality. I admit, I think your curated feed will already do that for you, over the tagged pictures section (not that many people use it), but that's an assumption so I could def be wrong, and there's no harm in trying to get both sections populated. 

Yes, I don't charge for photography and I can afford my conventions on my day job. That doesn't make it less important to me. We're just in different points in our lives, you'll soon be at that point too, probably as a pro photographer. For right now, have you considered doing an ad for the facebook groups for various cons? Those along with samples of your work should get you some good business.
