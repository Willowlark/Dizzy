Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I found so many cool places in Grand Central terminal that I wanna take pics in HNNNNNNG
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Also if u ever wanna take pics on a platform go to track 34 bc there's no columns up the middle of it and less trains go out of it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh? That’s a good idea.
Matt (mattmyers25): I feel that would make for a great shoot location for like fma or a 19th century shoot
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: There. Is a staircase I found that's way less traveled like I saw 2 ppl the whole time it's up by this amazing interior bar.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: 
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Like WTF this used to be someones office
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: That's why it's decorated this way he didn't wanna commute on trains like plebs and he had money so he got an office. In GCT.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I'm a slut for historic New York buildings
Jamie (Jamie): okay that is amazing looking and photoshoots or not i wanna go check it otu OuO
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: OwO historic building buddy??!?!
Jamie (Jamie): YIS
Matt (mattmyers25): Looks like a great place for a qrow shoot
Jamie (Jamie): okay so real talk I need to actually make plans to jump on a train some weekend so you can take me to cool as places and we can fan out about ridiculous shit together <@!289944569410224129>
Jamie (Jamie): how much do train tickets cost anyway 🤔
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: YEET 
Uhhhhh depends where u coming from 
Always travel off peak if u can
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Let me move to queens first. Then. CITY ADVENTURES
Jamie (Jamie): like my use of trains was a few times as a teen from lancaster to philly with my sister who set it all up. i am train noob major
Jamie (Jamie): by then i might have good proper finances so yes
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Listen I navigate the subway via trial and error and google maps
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Is ok I only take the train so often bc it's so much less stress than driving to city. Also stony had a train station on campus
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not photos but work in the city Anna, I need happy hour friends.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My office is boringgg
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Welllllllllll once I move to city
I will also need happy hour friends
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: OwO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Do you know the legendary art of “mingling at the bar” cause. I don’t and I need to *mingle*.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Uh. 
No but I hear it has something to do with sports
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nah, that’s not for da grrls just the office workers.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So *I* heard.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: U gotta just. Emphasize ur photog skills 
Chicks dig photog skills.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That is decidedly not true.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *then they have no taste*
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Anyways I have no idea how to hit on people or mingle
Who can we consult
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): True you of the fairer sex, I’m sure you got hit on rather than hitting on. <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Mark (Mad Doctor): This is all I got

Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Not gonna lie I can't tell when ppl have hit on me. Like. Ever. 
Friend used to have to follow me around and after was like "he was flirting with you" and I'd be like "oh I thought that was his default he just seemed nice"
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *don't get me started on if a girl hits on me I'm like this person obvs wants to be friends*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Loooooool Jess can comment on girls crushing on her.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also I’m wine drunk sooooo sorry if I’m a tad liberal with me thoughts.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I'm on a caffeine high so I feel u. 
Ok boy said talk about sports, cars, alchohol
So basically *normal conversation* 
This doesn't help
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how boring
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Yeah I mean at least we all have *riveting* conversations about the finer things in life. Like what paints u should and shouldn't use for fabric and foam.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~how many girls actually want to talk about cars and sports what~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not that I can do either.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also hi Pasquale.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Your boi a good boi.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Yeah idk women like hockey and baseball 
And. 
Vintage cars? I suppose?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Do they? If you polled this group I don’t think anyone cares about things like that?
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Pas is a good boy except he doesn't understand a damned thing about photo composition and it's killing me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hell I don’t.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Do u really think this group
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Is a good sample
Mark (Mad Doctor): Memes. I hear chicks did memes these days.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: For any statistic ever
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Yes memes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I will train Pas in photoshooting. It’s a wonderful thing to photo shoot someone you care about, cause you know their good sides.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pas would be the best photographer for you in the world cause he knows exactly what makes you beautiful~~ ❤️
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: U too kind
But pls because like. What I think looks good is not what he thinks looks good 
And 
The boy has no idea about angles and lighting. At all. It's kinda sad I wasn't aware i took my vague knowledge of thosw things as common knowledge 
But 
He will teach u how to go to bars like a normal human.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lol. Equivalent exchange. Hold me to this when I’m not wine drunk.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: U got a team of wingmen/wingwomen/wingpeople
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: As long as I don't have to hold ur beer while u do something stupid I'm down 
Bc I will probs be the one. Also doing the stupid.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Please encourage me to stupid thing.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Well considering my current stupid thing 
Is spending easter MOVING FURNITURE

Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Ironically it's for the only other Bill I know
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No no no, I want to do the stupid thing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not encourage you to.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: But. Friends do stupid things together. That's how u bond
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): LETS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I NEED 100% MORE STUPID IN MY LIFE
