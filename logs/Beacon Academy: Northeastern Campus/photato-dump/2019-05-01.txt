Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: its gonna be bad i think

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): you can still see your own likes.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: OH that makes sense then
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But it does make self analytics more difficult again.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: so it would hide on feed but not on your profile?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Helps people with bought followers get away with it too
Georgia (Something Sensible): I predict a definite increase in follower buying services

Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜® That is a neato place
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Honstly there's a lot of run down/abandoned place at my grandparents that if we ever wanted to do a Fallout shoot on location we could probs trek up there and do some photos around lol.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: OwO 
Or NieR but for NieR it's gotta be close to a road or something we can drive up to in AWD or a quad

Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I'm dead on the train tracks on a dirt road rn bc my bro is looking for bones but also I got service which is cool
