Monica (absolutezerocosplay): <@227431823062466569>  I'm glad you brought up the photographer thing. Being the cosplayer, I was not aware that tagging them in the picture itself helps them out more.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So curious Hunter, I believe you said you were using instagram for your portfolio? Instagram kinda shits on quality, and forces the resolution, why'd you choose to put it there?
ZombieHunter: It puts a collection of my things on a popular medium. People don’t really care for actual websites anymore.
ZombieHunter: It also casually and easily links people to cosplayers and a lot of people work via popularity. It’s a place people base decisions on (consider, a LOT of cosplayers discover their favorite cosplayers and photographers based on shots they find on Instagram.
ZombieHunter: I just woke up. My apologies, <@!184437198865563648>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What you apologizing for? Answering my question? XP
ZombieHunter: Lol taking my sweet ass time
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): How do you consider the tagged photo area different than your own, curated feed? It'll still have that link between you and the cosplayer, but you have control over what goes up there. Technically you could get tagged in non portfolio images right?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Considering pretty much all my non mutual followers came from wise rice over there, I know the mention in the comments does get some traction.
ZombieHunter: It’s true, but most of the time I can report or remove tag. The traction isn’t the goal.
Georgia (Something Sensible): 🤓 🍚
ZombieHunter: It’s that if someone goes on my profile, I have more photos in it than what I posted. Not clicks via the cosplayer’s profile.
Georgia (Something Sensible): To me it sounds advertise-ish and it makes sense
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s easier for people to check out the photographer through tag than to scroll through the description
Georgia (Something Sensible): Plus people will want to hire you if they’ve seen you shot with a beloved cosplayer
ZombieHunter: Again. Consider my work is all about my love of it PLUS it’s a business I want to consider going full time in.
ZombieHunter: People don’t visit sites like they used to. Instagram is something people are checking constantly. Casey goes every chance she gets.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): very true. I have google analytics on my site literally to watch myself go to it.
Georgia (Something Sensible): A website seems to make sense if you want an optimized platform for the highest quality of the photos you take
Georgia (Something Sensible): Instagram does get more traffic tho
ZombieHunter: Meanwhile instagram can do its own analytics and like Georgia said. It gets more traffic. Consider
ZombieHunter: Did you watch the fyre festival documentary?
Marisa (Mawisa): the netflix one or the hulu one? yes. :3c
ZombieHunter: The only reason it got so big was a bunch of big names on Instagram started talking about it. It became this massive curiosity. From posts. It’s a trend
ZombieHunter: While I hope not to be a fyre let down, I hope being in a platform that my friends maintain followings on helps me gain my own traction for sure.
ZombieHunter: I love photography. I super enjoy what I do. But to go to other cons and be in new places, you guys talking about me on Instagram gets me followers in places I can only dream of going to.
ZombieHunter: I recently had a follower tell me she wishes she could shoot with me and she only lives in Wisconsin
ZombieHunter: And she only found me because cosplayers mention me. You guys mention me and my work enough that she wants to work with me and enjoys my page thanks to cosplayers mentioning me. It’s a great feeling.
ZombieHunter: Websites are cool. But Instagram brings in work for me.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ``` You guys mention me and my work enough that she wants to work with me ```

Aren't you selling yourself short? She may like you entirely based on your work, not because so and so mentioned you.  Realistically she found you because of a cosplayer (lol photographer reach) but she probably stayed for your work.
ZombieHunter: It adds a piece of reliability
ZombieHunter: So and so works with him a lot. There’s consistency.
ZombieHunter: “They shoot with him a lot. Who is this guy?”
ZombieHunter: And then my own page can speak for itself.
ZombieHunter: Minus the fact that my tagged photos are all of Rebecca right now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Im sorrrryyyyyy <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
ZombieHunter: Lmfao
ZombieHunter: It’s fine. It’s what it was for. XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Consistency going to come from you shooting with the clients you've already built a relationship with.
ZombieHunter: This is true but cosplayers are willing to take a shot based on that though
ZombieHunter: My katsucon was 90% friends this year but it was still an honor to work with everyone.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Going to have to balance that you know. 😛 If you have a full roster of people who'll book you every con you'll never expand to new people.
ZombieHunter: I know. <@!471742493105324042>  booked me for this weekend 😄
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Annette~
ZombieHunter: The thing is I don’t get a lot of new people. I’m working with one other new person this weekend but I’m mostly all yours for Zenkai guys.
ZombieHunter: I have three bee shoots
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm shooting like 2 new people this weekend and I'm V excited. I get a little nervous working with new people but all works out in the end. ~~Granted they are still friends of mine or friends of a friend lol~~
ZombieHunter: I’m gonna bee the official photographer for bees
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 3 bee shoots just at zenkai? XD
ZombieHunter: Yep
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg XD
ZombieHunter: All in Saturday
ZombieHunter: On*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): SaturBee
ZombieHunter: This will bee the day we’ve waited for
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I like that, personally. But I’m shy and anti social.
ZombieHunter: This is fair
ZombieHunter: I thought I was til I learned idk how to shut up
ZombieHunter: 😃
ZombieHunter: >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Mood
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Same lol. I also mostly just shoot friends now or friends of friends cause I got so tired of being fucking stood up in the past for shoot random people booked with me -.-
ZombieHunter: I’ve learned I’m not As shy as I think in the moment
ZombieHunter: I am willing to ask for photos of strangers in passing, things like that.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee that's about all I do (if I remember and am not being awkwardly shy lol)
ZombieHunter: It’s how I met minomotu
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ayyyy!! 😄
ZombieHunter: I consider myself an anxious person I consider myself an introvert.
Marisa (Mawisa): i bet it's the applejuice
ZombieHunter: Fact: i am not
ZombieHunter: Marisa!
Marisa (Mawisa): that's me :0
ZombieHunter: No! XD
Marisa (Mawisa): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Mawisa): that stuff has a power ok it's powerful and mysterious
ZombieHunter: I bought it at Walmart
Marisa (Mawisa): cursed
i saw an employee pick up a used drug needle with their bare hands in a walmart once
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
ZombieHunter: Omg
ZombieHunter: Oh. To close up the photo conversation.
ZombieHunter: Sometimes I just have days where I sell myself short. Sometimes I believe I straight up suck.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): And that's why we're here to say Hunter stop being self depreciating and selling urself short
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Also here to say that I wouldn't have found Hunter if it wasn't for his tagged photos bc while he did put on caseys server that he was still taking shoots for CCE last year, I was like ok but still who this guy. So I went to Instagram and saw his tagged photos first bc like. What you post is indicative of what your taste is more imo but what you're tagged in is more indicative of what you provide. And I was like. Ok he's good
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Super late to that convo, was driving.
ZombieHunter: Anna has an amazing point. LOOK AT ALL OF YOU THOUGH. THANK YOU FOR BACK TAGGING ME
ZombieHunter: Everything up to jack and the one piece cosplay is new tags of photos that have been up. I haven’t even posted most of this and THAT Is so important.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I was gonna mention to matt to start doing this but wow... he's already ahead of me on doing it XD~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~rip~~
ZombieHunter: LOL
Matt (mattmyers25): ~~you have fail rebecca~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~rude :P~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): <@184437198865563648>  <@169297844874903552>  do you guys want me to do it for your pics too? Are there specific ones you want tagged?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nah. I don't really care.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mention, tag, just don't call me late for dinner.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷 I dont really care lol
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Aight 👌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Some tag me some dont. I dont care lol
ZombieHunter: Not everyone needs it. Photography is high on my priority list and cosplayers who really rely on photography I think need it though
