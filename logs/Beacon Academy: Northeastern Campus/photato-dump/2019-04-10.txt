Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee I have full res of all the photos
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~mind sharing?~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Here?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wanna see what it looks like without instagram destroying the quality.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yee lemme jump on my computer and I'll send it over.
I know sometimes the app I put it through destroys it sometimes .-.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): D: Fuuu the file is too big and won't lemme share??
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lemme try any of the others lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): just a screen cap of the actual image should be fine~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Instagram's no zooming policy kinda makes it hard to see details in images.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee instagram no like you to zoom in lol
