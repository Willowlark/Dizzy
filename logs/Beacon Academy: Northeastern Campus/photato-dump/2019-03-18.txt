ZombieHunter: mood lol sorry if anyone didnt like my story thing. it was just something i've been thinking about a lot
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I mean. 
It's true and you should say it 
Some people (me until u corrected us) didn't know that was the preferred tag method
ZombieHunter: it's my preferred method. i don't mind being in the description BUT that doesn't add the picture to my proile
ZombieHunter: profile
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I try and do both. If I ever missed tagging you physically in the photo I'm really sorry, and I'll try to be more aware from now on.
ZombieHunter: you're fine. it's just something i've been polite and messaging people BUT i hope this story and post helps overall for photographers is my goal
ZombieHunter: you guys are always very understanding
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I will try to remember to do this in the future but bare with me.. cause I am awful at tagging unless I physically see who I need to tag in the photo.. RIP üôÉ
ZombieHunter: That's fair. You can add it though later on

ZombieHunter: my IG is my portfolio so i just see this as important. i don't know how other photographers feel about it BUT i hope the way i explained it shows how important it can be to tag a photographer this way
ZombieHunter: like "this is a thing. ... i think it's important. and here's why"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee. I get ya. I can deff see how it helps show work cause not all work you do goes on your profile, so everyone tagging helps create a portfolio of everything you've done üòÉ
