ZombieHunter: Thank you guys for supporting my work though. Seriously guys
ZombieHunter: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been happier with my own work and I can‚Äôt wait to see what this year brings
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~thank you for listening to us and charging appropriately for your work~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): well. now you will be RIGHT
ZombieHunter: Yeah yeah yeah
Anna (loud and likely blonde): good
ZombieHunter: Anna‚Äôs been yelling at me. Heads up that my shoots will be going up to 45
ZombieHunter: BUT first three to book me for any con will get ten bucks off.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): bc you are charging like pocket change for what u deliver
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): everyone help me enforce hunter's new pricing

ZombieHunter: N o
ZombieHunter: Free photo shoot for whoever let‚Äôs me sleep on their floor at zenkai
Marisa (Mawisa): I‚Äôll angrily come after you and your apple juice won‚Äôt be able to stop me this time
ZombieHunter: N o
Matt (mattmyers25): I got my photos back from my qrow shoot
Matt (mattmyers25): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Raising prices is always valid. I just raised mine for Zenkai after getting newer/better equipment. Katsu was my trial run to test out camera officially. $45 is not bad at all though.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): How‚Äôd you decide the numbers? Just picked arbitrarily? I‚Äôve wondered before but I cannot figure out how to value my work.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): would base it off 1) how many hours u think its gonna take to shoot and edit based off minimum wage in ur state at LEAST and then 2) how much experience you got
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just up mine by $5 every time I get new equipment or feel I should raise them. I think when I started out I had some people tell me to start at $15 since it was low cost since new but also making a decent amount. Was a good starting point. That was back 5 years ago. I don't raise mine to much cause I don't do a ton of editing aside from blemishes and lighting, etc. I can't do special effects so that's why I still charge on the lower end.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I think I last upped mine a year ago cause Matt said I was taking time to edit out blemishes and lighting and I needed to calculate that into my cost/time. Which... he right lol.
ZombieHunter: I started at 8 a shoot Rebecca
ZombieHunter: Shannon helped me
ZombieHunter: When I started, I charged eight for the hour I used to take and was only returning like. Three photos. I wasn‚Äôt confident. I didn‚Äôt know composition
ZombieHunter: Last year, naychan was fighting with me on quality and that she would have been willing to pay sixty for a shoot with some of the photos I‚Äôd done
ZombieHunter: And while my shoots were more stagnant, this past August and onward sparked me to learn more and more.
ZombieHunter: I‚Äôve gained almost 300 followers in six months and I‚Äôm impressed with it. I don‚Äôt question my decisions anymore. And I‚Äôm able to feel like I know much more of what I‚Äôm doin Lin
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~good naychan~~
ZombieHunter: Like. I‚Äôll make one today regardless
ZombieHunter: But the shots I‚Äôve had from September to now has been
ZombieHunter: Everything now.
ZombieHunter: And I‚Äôll make a few compositions with my other photos in it
ZombieHunter: Here we go
ZombieHunter: This is my last six months ONLY
ZombieHunter: 
ZombieHunter: The more and more I think about these photos the more i think wow. I‚Äôm really changing every week and more and more I love my work and the feelings I get from images
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you're doing incredible
ZombieHunter: I feel. Incredible. Like those are just shots in my phone.
ZombieHunter: Not all the shots I‚Äôve loved.
ZombieHunter: The fall shoot isn‚Äôt here. The shoots in the basement. The love I have for my own work feels so Igbo IOU‚Äôs but I‚Äôm so happy
ZombieHunter: Like I met wish and she said Leanna talks about me work and I‚Äôm so glad
ZombieHunter: My
ZombieHunter: And like. People are trying to work with me and it feels so amazing.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ngl, i talk about you and how great your photos are and how much i love you like ALL the fucking time~~
ZombieHunter: Like emotionally I always think I‚Äôm a nobody.
ZombieHunter: Like I don‚Äôt think myself as anyone outside a friend but this reputation building as a photographer is
ZombieHunter: Like feeling this worthiness I didn‚Äôt have before?
ZombieHunter: It‚Äôs emotional. Like. I want to cry. It‚Äôs overwhelming but I wouldn‚Äôt have any of it if not for everyone who supports my work.
