Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://gfycat.com/sourcarefulbeagle ~~if you hang out with my while shooting you will learn how to direct light, source <@!386874959009415170>~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I love this gif/video. It's always so cool to me
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~pls teach me to direct light source ill wear platform shoes for ur height convenience~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gotta say, Erik's wingspan is hella convenient. Course I don't make any money to *pay* assistants so people usually yeet when they aren't also getting shots. 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I may be smol but if you ever need help with shoots Bill lemme know. I'm always willing to help~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 👍
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Watching you shoot Georgia was a good time too.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like to help cause I learn things sometimes :3
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lmao was I a mess? XD Cause I tend to be an all over the place person when shooting LOL
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'll *literally* will not shut up once I get going, so I can help anytime.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, you were coming off a buzz so you told us...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao valid XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I sure was lol. I'm pretty sure I had a buzz going for all my shoots that weekend... OOPS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Naaaaaah that fine.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I drank my way through C3p-ho and the mystic messenger boudoir.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I'm def open to talk shop if you'd like! I only saw you do that shoot but since Georgia posted it you must have done them already too. 👌
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~ok but if i get stronger i can also help hold ppl up for poses~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Anna you are welcome anytime lol
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~i just wanna support my friends. literally and emotionally~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): might I direct you to <#496327044997578762>
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~sometimes literally sew them back together~~
Anna (Blonde Banshee): lmfao im actually doing abs and arms
Anna (Blonde Banshee): gotta hold them light director things
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~also rebecca and i have vaguely similar cameras i think so imma leach her knowledge~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): As I saw from Georgia's vlog LMAO. I died laughing as ya took a sip and just kept shooting. Like what a mood. I had valid reasons to be drinking most of Zenkai though 🤷🏻‍♀️ woopsiee. And yeee I'm always down to talk editing and stuff. Learn some new things. I've been looking at new programs cause mine just allows basic editing. Nothing major like letting me add in other things. Etc. I wanna get photoshop but it expensive lol
Anna (Blonde Banshee): *the opening to georgia's vlog was comedy gold*
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ...............
Anna (Blonde Banshee): i actually.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): downgraded to the photographer package from the creative cloud
Anna (Blonde Banshee): lmk if u want my second login
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): photographer package is fairly well priced.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): yeah i was paying for full cloud cause i used to get student price
Anna (Blonde Banshee): but now.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): no
Anna (Blonde Banshee): and i hate giving adobe $30+ a month
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have the full thing cause I split with my sister, but when we stop scamming a student discount she's on her own cause I only use LR and Photoshop.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ill be honest i think if u never stop ur sub it keeps going
Anna (Blonde Banshee): although the black friday sale is epic from adobe
Anna (Blonde Banshee): like 75 % off for full year you can get
Anna (Blonde Banshee): and still pay monthly
Anna (Blonde Banshee): idk if you can get it if you already use it tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We had to change the email (my sister's student email was going to expire) to mine (which I can keep forever if I update the password) and it was dicey.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My student ID doesn't have a date on it so we got away with it.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~i did that to my personal and it kept the price wtf~~
Anna (Blonde Banshee): like i dead switched to a gmail.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): from my stonybrook.edu email. i never got an alumi one.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): *anyways* rebecca lmk ill give u my login cause it comes with 2? activations and I only use 1
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!169297844874903552> Ye. I can be a bit critical when I give advice (but just cause I care promise) but anything I can teach you I will.
