Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@227431823062466569> Pretty awesome about emailing a wedding photographer. Is weddings something you'd get into?
ZombieHunter: my parents are uh
ZombieHunter: they're finally pushing me if i wanna get into photography work
ZombieHunter: like
ZombieHunter: full business and all.
ZombieHunter: like if i wanna be a photographer for a living, they're willing to push me for the first time
ZombieHunter: i said i respect going to college. i respect working in an office to get started, but they support that photography may be the one thing i love more than anything else in terms of a passion
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You have more courage than I do, I couldn't photograph full time.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Would you go straight up wedding photographer?
ZombieHunter: probably not. but weddings are where the money is at
