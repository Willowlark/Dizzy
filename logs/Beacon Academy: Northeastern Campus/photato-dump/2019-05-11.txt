Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@227431823062466569> Have you done any research into how photogs handle print rights in the community? Someone's asked me about it and I have no idea what ways photographers handle that.
ZombieHunter: Depends on how you choose to handle it.
ZombieHunter: Some choose to self permanent rights. I know a guy who gives a three year release.
ZombieHunter: Iâ€™ve had people offer partial profits.
ZombieHunter: What are you thinking youâ€™d like to do?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm not sure. I kinda wanted ideas from what other people do and pick from what I like.
ZombieHunter: So, some cosplayers will do a percentage of profit. 
Others will do temporary rights which, depending on how much they tend to sell, can be more profitable for you.
ZombieHunter: And you can think it over again in a few years. 
Others will do permanent rights and take a one time fee which can be good.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I don't think I could be bothered to track the term of the agreement.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So one time may be best.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oof and while split profits is a thing that's got... A lot of implication on it as well.
Georgia (Something Sensible): <@227431823062466569> what IS your prints policy?
ZombieHunter: I'll part with rights for 100 for life
ZombieHunter: lol
ZombieHunter: permanent rights.
Georgia (Something Sensible): you think thatll be your permanent policy? i feel like for a cosplayer like jessica nigri or someone youd make less back
ZombieHunter: I think if I ever shot with her and she wanted to sell my photo
ZombieHunter: i'd die before she could buy the rights, <@!245270932602486784>
ZombieHunter: ðŸ˜‚
ZombieHunter: I think if I ever got bigger and I work with cosplayers I know will make hundreds off a print
ZombieHunter: I'll up the ante
ZombieHunter: but for now? 100. and tbh?
ZombieHunter: some of you would make that back in ten photos
ZombieHunter: 150 is my high end if i don't like someone ðŸ˜‚
ZombieHunter: I'll even let people presale and decide if they wanna buy the rights tbh
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thanks for the info Hunter.
ZombieHunter: ðŸ˜„ Glad I could help. I only know one photographer who does temporary rights, so. I recommend a serious trust in terms of sales cut. but otherwise, pick a price point you feel is worth your photo's rights and go with it ðŸ˜ƒ
