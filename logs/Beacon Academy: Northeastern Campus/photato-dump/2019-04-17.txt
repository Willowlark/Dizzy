Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have yours mostly done as well Bill. Just gotta edit a few more lol. ~~I didn't expect to get them done this quick as usual but I didnt feel well yesterday so neglected other things to do this since calming lol~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Girl I haven't touched half the stuff from Zenkai, sorted normiecon, and haven't even picked the edit candidates from Kogara and Sakura Sunday.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao valid XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Getting anything back in the same MONTH is impressive.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I usually do my edits from shoots when not feeling well or need a break from cleaning or homework... which is often thus is why I get stuff back so soonn XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The biggest blessing has been tablet sync for lightroom.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I do most of my editing on my ipad now, I just have to sort through the folder for the ones I want to use at my desk, and publish from there.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The bulk of the editing is on the tablet.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh nicu 😮
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Which is way easier to use on the train, which is when I get the most time to work.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Definitely the favorite.
Anna (blonde and sad): U look like u need a top hat for that bottom one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ironpenny came out pretty damn good too Rebecca, props. The bright stairs and the shaded people causes a fair bit of chaos in the metering, so getting good shots is tough.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thanks! Yee I struggled a bit in editing with how much light was reflecting off of them cause the light colored costumes but worked my way around to balance it out and not make them look like giant glowing orbs as best as I could 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I stated last night I need to remember to bring my reflector xD ~~once I find it lol~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe):

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mm. I haven’t looked in depth yet but I’m expecting when I shot under the balcony thing it’ll be nicer for Mawisa. Shot both stairs and there for here.
Anna (blonde and sad): So who wants to get a kiddie pool for uh. Science.
