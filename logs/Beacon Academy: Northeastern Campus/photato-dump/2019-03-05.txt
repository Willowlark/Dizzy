ZombieHunter: question: what is a silly memory you have of a photoshoot we've done? If we've shot together.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Me stepping on Matt's hand and us almost peeing ourselves in laughter ðŸ˜‚
Anna (loud and likely blonde): The first time we met you and I didn't realize my yang arm was full of water and I accidentally threw water at your face when I went to shake your hand at the end ðŸ’€
ZombieHunter: i literally just told my friend that story xD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Me not realizing my yang arm was full of water and slinging water at your head at the end of the shoot by accident ðŸ’€
ZombieHunter: i hate you
ZombieHunter: xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good xD 
And LMAO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): To be fair there was preemptive karma bc my wig was so heavy I fell backwards off the inner tube
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Same shoot. Great experience
ZombieHunter: LOL
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~your spare underwear through all of last konkon~~
ZombieHunter: not a photoshoot
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Technically you were doing many photoshoot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The *horse*
