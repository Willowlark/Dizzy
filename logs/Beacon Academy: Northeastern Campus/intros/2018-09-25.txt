Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Oops, just realized I never wrote one of these. Hi, I'm Annette. Also known as @cryostasis_cosplay on Instagram and CryostasisCosplay on Facebook. You have probably met me at the KonKon Christmas photoshoot or from Katsucon 2018 (if you have met me!). I mostly cosplay Kali Belladonna and Yang. Though I still have a quite a few RWBY cosplans in the future. Thank you for inviting me into the group!
