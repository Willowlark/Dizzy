Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I dunno, I'd have liked to see Bucky get it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But Bucky very much wants to be *done* with shit so I get it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i would too, but it couldve gone either way
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): rhodey gets it in the comics, as does bucky in another
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: id have liked them to go that way too but i think the comics do both? i cant rememeber
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: too many divergent storylines
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: its like canon fanfic aus
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~everyone's done everything in the comics~~

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If Rhodey gets Iron Man's suit and Cap's Shield, would he become *Captain Ironica*? <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: ugh pls i need some more addressing of rhodey's emotions next movie. well. next movie hes in.

Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: *dont u finger guns at me*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): relationship ended with nat, now hawkeyes my best friend
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it just out of the blue became a thing in Ultron then they touched on it a bit in Ragnarok, and then let it die
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: ugh that was such a STUPID PLOT POINT IN RAGNAROK
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I HATED IT
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: THAT SCENE INFURIATED ME
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think if it was serious, Bruce would have been even more devastated by Nat's death
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: especially 'does she have any family?' "yeah, us."
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lmao ok he was kinda just like "wow im sad... but... she saved the world so we chill"
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: wait shit didnt banner even ask if she had family
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: was that banner???
Erik (Red Riot Thot): one (1) angry fist pound
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAo
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: on a scale of 1-married thats like college hookup seriousness of relationship
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think it was Tony who asked "does she have any family" and Bruce said "yeah, us"
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: THATS WHO IT WAS yea ok i was wrackin my brain
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *I think*
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: either that or cap

Erik (Red Riot Thot): only important things were Thor learning about the Infinity Stones
Erik (Red Riot Thot): no I meant Age of Ultron wasn't great
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Antman and the Wasp was fantastic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): xD antman is so great
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): age of ultron was a waste of a movie

Erik (Red Riot Thot): and his running gag with Conan O'Brien is amazing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bNzAgJMYVE
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Paul Rudd is the best because he's a fucking meme.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like, he didn't try and be a serious super hero who shrinks down to ant size.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): He's the guy who *shrinks to ant size* and kicks ass while doing it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's so important that he doesn't take himself seriously.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): als grows big
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): big boi
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): smol boi
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): medium boi
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like, I hated Ant Man in the comics cause he's like "I'm a serious scientist blah blah blah". Scott Lang is like 'lol I can do WHAT'.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Best MCU Dadâ„¢*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://twitter.com/thorsbrvce/status/1128284684486610946
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he essentially turns his entire house into one big fort so he can play with his daughter while on house arrest
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he turned stairs into slides using cardboard
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): wow fuck I used to have that sweatshirt too.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): HE'S WEARING CROCS
Erik (Red Riot Thot): HOW DID I NOT NOTICE THAT
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): All I fucking need is a wig, boom. Fat thor.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): SAME COLOR I OWN
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the crocs match his outfit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LmaO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): honestly he must have been really excited to have such a comfy costume
Erik (Red Riot Thot): although, fatsuit probably wasn't comfy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): aside from the fat suit
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I didn't realize Carol was in Alias, Jessica's comics.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i didnt know that either
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): never read jessicas comics though
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CarolDanvers if you're interested in the highlights (and low points) of Cap Marvel's comic career.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): never even tried xD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): She actually gets a shit rep for a long time.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers I read some of these, mostly cause Hawkeye's protege.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): She's great.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): God I want to read this stuff but I also know once I try I'mma get hella lost and give up, like the last 5 times.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its frustrating
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and not really worth the struggle at this point. thats why theyre making like a billion movies
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): easier to digest
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ye but odds are Kate ain't making to the MCU.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~though Hawkeye's daughter is learning Archery so maybe she'll be Hawkeye too~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I could see Morgan, Hawkeye's daughter, Peter, any other young characters doing a young avengers in the MCU.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): arent they making a tv series? or did i just fabricate that in my mind
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have noooo idea lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I was so busy not getting spoiled for Endgame I'm behind.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I own All New Hawkeye actually.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's some good shit.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh they had a tv show, animated
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in 2013
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): with kate
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): young avengers
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok im not on crack, thats good
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ooof the animated stuff is still kid focused though ain't it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not really
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it just airs on kid channels cause theyre cartoons, but its not like dumbed down or anything
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): more comic relief usually
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): hmm.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I should focus on reading Jones tho.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ALSO WHAT apparently she dates Scott Lang for awhile.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ```What If?: As part of her backstory, Jessica is beaten savagely by The Avengers after attacking them while under Mind Control; when they realize this, they offer her a position as the Avengers/S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison. She declines. A one-off What If? issue (included in the series omnibus) revealed what would have happened had she accepted: she is happy, not depressed; as an outsider in Avenger's Mansion, she spots the mental problem that Scarlet Witch has before she can cause the Avengers Disassembled debacle; she marries Steve Rogers. ``` Comic books man.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SOUNDS FAKE BUT OK
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): God, I can't imagine it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): > Sees trouble
> Cap: Gotta go help them!
> Jessica: ...
> Cap: Aaare you coming?
> Jessica: Nope.
> Jessica: *sits down, crosses legs, pulls out flask*
> Jessica: I'll be right here, watching your ass as you pound em.
> Cap: Um.
> Jessica: Chop.
> Jessica: Chop.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): > Cap, tells Jessica what to do
> Jessica: you got yup, hail hydra and all that jazz.

Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: and they were like.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: uh.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: maybe just watch the movie
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There are multiple. That sounds like Hank Pym Ant Man rather than Scott Lang.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: that sounds familiar
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: probably
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: as we have established. comics go timey wimey fucky wucky
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: did a google and yes that ant man
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): `Papa Wolf: Go after Cassie and Scott will make you regret it.` Yeah I just can't imagine Scott being a dick.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Confirmed, was Hank.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: i just. i gotta say the text being formatted like that makes it like 3x more cursed at first glance.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): wow shit, you read about Scott and it's like "papa wolf good guy" and then you read Hank and it's "biopolar sometimes evil ultron? clone??? person? eaten by the soul stone?"
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: OOF
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need to get off tvtropes.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yah. Movie Ant Man is a vast improvement over the comics one. And on a related note, I was able to convince the Ant Man and the Wasp screenwriter to come talk to my nerd club next Thursday
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
