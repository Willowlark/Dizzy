Erik (Red Riot Thot): It makes sense. Peter B. Parker has seen some shit
Mark (Mad Doctor): Alright people, let's do this one last time. My name is Peter B. Parker. I was bitten by a radioactive spider for the last twenty-two years, I thought I was the one and only Spider-Man. I'm pretty sure you know the rest. What a day. You see I saved the city, worked for Mr. Stark, fell in love, got dusted by Thanos, went to Europe. I got married, saved the city some more, maybe too much...
