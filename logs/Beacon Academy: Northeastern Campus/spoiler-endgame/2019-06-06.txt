Mark (Mad Doctor): One of my students edited this. He's sixteen. https://youtu.be/9vnh0WZGBH8
Jamie (Jamie): that is actually very impressive editing skills
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Wow that's like professional quality
Jamie (Jamie): okay i went through the posted videos he's done and i will be personally upset if one day he is not in the film industry in one way or another cause he has some serious upcoming talent in what he's doing
Jamie (Jamie): is he self taught or your school have film classes he takes?
Mark (Mad Doctor): We have a film class, but it's really his passion and he does a lot on his own. He got an internship at an effects firm two years ago that turned into a part time job. He wound up doing some work on Captain Marvel
Jamie (Jamie): that is amazing damn
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'll pass along your complements
Anna [Cyborg]: Please tell this kid he's gonna go places
