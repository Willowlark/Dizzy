Erik (Red Riot Thot): Inaccurate Pop
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Not thicc enough
Mark (Mad Doctor): Looking for Fat Bastard Funko...
ZombieHunter: Somebody peed my pants.
ZombieHunter: Idk if it was old me or baby me. Or me me.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Guys I just remembered that there's gonna be TV series based off Clint, Wanda, and Loki.

Endgame might have made me cry 100 times but there's a light in the distance XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): I don't subscribe to Netflix, but im all in for Disney streaming for that reason
Mark (Mad Doctor): OK, Cap goes back in time and lives out a normal life with Peggy. But he can't interfere in the one timeline that defeats Thanos. Which means he has to let Kennedy and King and Howard Stark get assassinated. He has to let Bucky endure decades of torture. He has to watch the events of the MCU unfold and do nothing. He has to live in hiding, lest he be recognized. Peggy has to make excuses for the husband no one has met. Unless Steve adopts a new identity as "a guy who looks a lot like Cap." Maybe he becomes an actor and goes under the name Chris Evans...
Mark (Mad Doctor): What about people who lost their spouse in the first snap and remarried? Single people who diappeared, leaving their pets in the apartment? People who come back, only to find another family living in their home?  It's good that Thanos was defeated, but it's going to be a messy recovery
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm way overthinking this
ZombieHunter: O y
ZombieHunter: Mark stop@hurting me like this
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cap: "Avengers I'm trying to sneak around, but I'm DUMMY THICC. And the clap of my ass cheeks keeps alerting Hydra."
