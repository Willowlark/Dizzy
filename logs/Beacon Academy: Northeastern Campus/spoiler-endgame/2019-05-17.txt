Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have no use for this but I also have a mighty need for it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Hey so I thought about this earlier and it made me sad so now you all have to be sad, but Tony Stark's first meal after escaping Afghanistan and becoming Iron Man for the first time was a cheeseburger from Burger King so when Morgan says she wants a cheeseburger, Happy says "You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers" and there's so much more meaning behind that and now I'm sad. Happy Friday everyone
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: *why do you make me FEEL things*
