Anna [Cyborg]: So that hurt less than the first time. Also our debate as to what they say when it's 'did she have any family? ' 'yeah us' is Tony asking Steve responding
Anna [Cyborg]: I have now moved onto critique of the inaccuracies
Anna [Cyborg]: Oh. My. God. They shot it but didn't process it fully
Anna [Cyborg]: It's a hulk scene
Anna [Cyborg]: It looks like the jolly Green giant saves people from a burning high-rise b
Anna [Cyborg]: Not worth
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yup
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the link above described it and when t said "not fully rendered" I was like womp never mind
Anna [Cyborg]: It. Literally looked like jolly Green giant. 
It was. Also not a great scene
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think it was intended to introduce the audience to "Dr. Hulk," but they decided the cafe scene did the job as effectively
Anna [Cyborg]: The cafe scene was better bc you needed paul Rudd as a comedic transition for it
Anna [Cyborg]: Got the free poster tho so like. $6 was worth it
