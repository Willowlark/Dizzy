Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://twitter.com/RottenTomatoes/status/1152752745079697408?s=20
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): wait.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Mjolnir doesn't exist anymore.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: No cap brought it back rememeber
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: After Thor brought it back
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It got destroyed by Hela and the one from the past was returned along with the stones.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Did I imagine it on the floor next to him?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Rip
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wibbly wobbly timey wimey hammer
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: *time smash*
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's just a jump to the left
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Cap brought it back to its place in time
Erik (Red Riot Thot): At least that's what was implied when he yeeted back to the past with it
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: maybe they'll forge another?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm sure Peter Dinklage still has three mold for it
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Isnt it just in asgard then?
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Or did cap bring it back to like.... its creation
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: .................................directors explain
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): I mean, either way. They can find it
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): It's not gone
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: unless he dropped it in asgard back before frigga died
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: he did have to return the stone to that point so....maybe?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, in order to have events play out the same way he'd have to return it to the moment Thor left with it.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I would assume he'd return it to the point it was taken because the Thor of that reality was probably like "wtf where'd my hammer go?"
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i mean they already caused like 4 accidental extra timelines so who knows
Mark (Mad Doctor): And the Thor who lost his hammer to the other Thor would not have it broken by Hela, forcing a different outcome to Ragnarok.
This is why I get frustrated with time travel and alternate timelines. Sad at the loss of Tony Stark? Yoink him out of another timeline! It diminishes the stakes for characters we care about. But I guess comics have been dealing with that for decades.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: eh i mean i thought it was a convenient way to explain how theyre like picking and choosing which stories go on the big screen but. it does cheapen some aspects of characterization. 
it is annoying when it ruins continuity but when you have that continuity that you dont realize its like HOLY CRAP
