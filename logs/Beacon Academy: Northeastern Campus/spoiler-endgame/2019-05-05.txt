Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): fuck I miss Regular Show
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So rewatching Avengers and Fury said that they were going to make weapons because they discovered they "weren't alone" in this world (Thor). Yet Fury dealt with aliens in the 90s... ðŸ¤”
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Can't tell if that's a MIB reference or fury thought they killed them all
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No like, the whole Thor incident he said *"Last year,Â EarthÂ had a visit fromÂ another planetthat had a grudge match that leveled aÂ small town. We learned that only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously outgunned."*
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: O right in the first Thor movie
Erik (Red Riot Thot): As if that was the first time they encountered something from another world
Mark (Mad Doctor): Maybe Fury got hit by the flashy thing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): MCU MIB crossover when?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Will Smith vs Samuel L. Jackson would be a neverending feud of sassy black men
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And it would be awesome
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Reason being that the alien thing in captain marvel most likely was as heavily restricted and redacted as captain marvel's project was if not more so 
Plus for the most part it was handled outside the agency, and the avengers was only his pet project from before he really  had power in shield
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: They were aware of aliens, but as far as the government was concerned they had no idea the difference in power 
Skip forward to Thor
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Nick Fury now has the power and influence to make watching for aliens a high priority
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And Thors arrival is extremely public and clear for the US Government 
Quiet out there, and it includes civilians who are researching space
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: (Captain marvel was much more covert vs thors grudge match)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: It gives him the push he needs to convince the council to go forward with the Avengers protocol (which he hadn't been allowed to start properly with really till thor and Iron Man 2)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Also note the use of we, and not I,
Hes talking from Shields perspective, as a representative of the group explaining the situation to those who are unaware
