Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: ..... Ok but I'm here for this 
Personally I enjoyed more of the poetic tragedy of time and self sacrifice separating them n the whole moving on without the other trope but I am a sucker for angst but. Maybe he can be happy. NVM I lied this is also delicious angst. Peggy seeing young Steve again when he's cap still and. She 100% knows what's going to happen and she can't tell them. she knows how it ends. 

And. Ok now I need to know. Do their kids know who their dad is?? Do they know ???? 
DOES CAPS KIDS GET SNAPPED they would be like middle aged right ?
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Hello I have questions my mind is going a mile a minute
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I'm probs off with some of that but. There's so many *implications* of him staying in the past still in my head
