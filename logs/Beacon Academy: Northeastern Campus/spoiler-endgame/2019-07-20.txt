Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Apparently some Shit went down at sdcc between the Russo's, Chris Evans, and the MCU fanbase
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: And the Russo's did a JK Rowling 'xyz happened after the cameras were rolling' and 'originally thanos was going to go back to 2014 and decapitate Steve and bring his head back to taunt the avengers' 
* W h a t*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Russos no, that's how you get an R rated film...*
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: O man apparently. Chris Evans is. Still just in a world of hurt for what they did to cap and basically the Russo's just keep digging their grave deeper about the ending 
Kinda funny
Kinda sad
