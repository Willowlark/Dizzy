Erik (Red Riot Thot): FUCK DUDE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Hunter and I have been crying for an hour
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I didn't shed any tears but my eyes were welling up during that fucking funeral
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And when everyone came back through the portals
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I became a lesbian for a second when Peter handed the glove to Carol and all the women were there
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That was a satisfying ending to both Tony and Steve's narratives
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO HUNTER AND I WERE LIKE " WOW I WISH WE WERE PETER PARKER"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm sad because Tony was always my favorite but he got to die knowing he saved everyone
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): God I started fucking SOBBING when Steve was shown with peggy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And that's enough for me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm so upset but so satisfied
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Are you still sitting in the credits?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yep
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Trying to compose myself
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So Thor in Guardians 3?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Loki also maybe still alive? He yeeted out with the cube
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm a little upset that they gave the shield to rhodey
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Instead of bucky
ZombieHunter: God
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But otherwise I'm so satisfied
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And so sad/happy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wow no post scene
ZombieHunter: Yeah that’s been posted online a lot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Wow I'm dying
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's how much of my popcorn I actually managed to get through
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I ate my entire candy and a hotdog BEFORE the movie
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): God ok you know what I wasnt prepared for
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Black widow
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I didnt know I cared enough
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh same
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But I knew it had to be her
Erik (Red Riot Thot): She had so much less to lose
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need a very stiff drink
ZombieHunter: My soul wasn’t ready for that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What do I do with my life now
ZombieHunter: Stop staring st me Leanna
ZombieHunter: It’s creepy
ZombieHunter: 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HUNTER WHAT DO I DO WITH MY LIFE
ZombieHunter: GO HOME
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MY HEART FEELS WEIRD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Idk if I should be happy or sad
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Both
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Both is....
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...a thing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Your heart feels sappy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or had
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh I was freaking out for you when Carol got her haircut
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was like YES THAT'S LEANNA'S SHIT RIGHT THERE
Erik (Red Riot Thot): With that, the lady Avengers scene, and Valkyrie taking over as king of Asgard, I can guarantee ~~Ethan~~ people are going to give it crap for being "feminist pandering" lmao
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also Steve saying "Hail Hydra" was that supposed to be a reference when Steve said that in the comics, but like, was actually part of Hydra?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Scott: "I'M INSIDE YOU"
Georgia (Something Sensible): IM CRYING IN THE CLUB
Erik (Red Riot Thot): JOIN THE CLUB
Mark (Mad Doctor): Steve Weeping Angeled himself!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but it was so deserved
Mark (Mad Doctor): Very satisfying film.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he began by being robbed of his youth with Peggy and spent years doing his duty. It was time to retire and give him his life
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Should have fucking saw the foreshadowing when Tony said "not dying in the process would be ideal"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good endings for him and Tony. Natasha deserved better
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I thought they'd somehow get the stone and both she and Clint survive
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but he had so much more to live for
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): God ok I'm home and I'm still shook
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like I'm shaking
Erik (Red Riot Thot): y'all I went all day without drinking any liquids and I've had a few sips of blackberry moonshine and I'm FEELING IT NOW MR. KRABS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Probably from dehydration
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But wow
Erik (Red Riot Thot): OH SAME
Erik (Red Riot Thot): DEHYDRATION BUDDIES!!!!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 😄 😄 😄
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HELL YEAHDRA
Mark (Mad Doctor): My son had to get popcorn. Between the salt and dehydration, I'm dying.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hail hydration
Erik (Red Riot Thot): DEHAIL DEHYDRA
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yall
Mark (Mad Doctor): Had to see it in 3d. The only effects that seemed decent were the fields around Clint's house.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE SCOTT UTTERED THE WORDS "I'M INSIDE YOU"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): My pinup cap is literally the end of the movie. It has Peggy's hair. A 40s dress and captain Americas ...look
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm shaking
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WALKING SPOILER D:
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): NOT IF I DONT ANNOUNCE IT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But yea basicaly
Erik (Red Riot Thot): your pinup Cap is so good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WE DIDNT GET ANTMAN INSIDE THANOS...but we did get him inside tony
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I should do regular Cap because I've got the hair for it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So I'm satisified
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Please do
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): PLEASE FUCKING DO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but that suit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need to find one that doesn't look like shit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or break the bank
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I mean... true that's why I ended up doing pinup instead of the suit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Laziness
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but I might break the bank
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And also money
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but then I could join that group that works with kids
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YOU COULD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and I think that would be so much fun
Mark (Mad Doctor): On the plus side, I finally think I could cosplay Thor (Lebowski version)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I WAS DYING WHEN THEY SHOWED HIS BEER GUT
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I can't wait for the memes that say the most tragic death was Thor's physique
Mark (Mad Doctor): Infinity Moobs
Georgia (Something Sensible): Favorite lines: that is the ass of America
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): also Tony got a heartfelt moment with his dad which was wholesome as fuck
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's when I got the foreshadowing vibe. And I ship CapXCap
Erik (Red Riot Thot): can we get an Iron Woman film with Pepper?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Welp here’s another perfectly dead redhead to cosplay
Erik (Red Riot Thot): LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg pepper and tony killed me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Pepper in the suit fighting alongside Tony fucking destroyed me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And new Cap film with Sam?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They set up for so many new potential films
Mark (Mad Doctor): A series has been announced w Sam and Bucky
Georgia (Something Sensible): I screamed when Peter jumped through the portal
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): God I'm so glad because I was worried I wouldnt have anything to look forward to besides guardians
Georgia (Something Sensible): Legit screams
Erik (Red Riot Thot): HEY MR. STARK REMEMBER THAT TIME WE WERE IN SPACE///
Mark (Mad Doctor): My theater went nuts on the portal scenes
Georgia (Something Sensible): ME AS FUCK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The entire theater cheered when Peter came through
Georgia (Something Sensible): my theater went nuts over Thor’s new bod
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like scream cheer
Georgia (Something Sensible): SAME
Erik (Red Riot Thot): we cheered when everyone came through
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I heard audible gross sobbing at Tony
Mark (Mad Doctor): And when cap picked up mjollnir
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ... I cheered when the girls surrounded peter
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeS CAP WIH MJOLNIR KILLED MY THESTER
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I became a lesbian for a brief moment at that part
Mark (Mad Doctor): Same
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah there was actual sobbing at the funeral
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): CAP WITH BOTH MJOLNIR AND THE AXE THO
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like full weeping
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Hunter was LOUDLY crying next to me
Georgia (Something Sensible): I could watch the cap vs thanos smackdown all day
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And I held it together until the scene with cap and peggy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And then I just started crying like a baby
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like I didnt know I needed that
Georgia (Something Sensible): I have a new appreciation for Antwan
Erik (Red Riot Thot): GIVE ME THAT ONE. YOU GET THE LITTLE ONE
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I still need to see both Antman films
Georgia (Something Sensible): _im inside you_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Antman is great
Georgia (Something Sensible): Scott Lang is good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): guess I gotta go to FYE and buy the rest of the movies I'm missing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): God this movie was so fucking good
Georgia (Something Sensible): I love my bug bois
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need to see those and Black Panther
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestlyyyy the first half was boring to me but the second came out on fire
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and Captain Marvel
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah that's when the bathroomable moments were
Mark (Mad Doctor): I loved the character bits in the first half
Erik (Red Riot Thot): once that third hour came around...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea first half was pee time
Georgia (Something Sensible): Black widow didn’t deserve that ending tho damn
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The intro with Clint's family killed me
Mark (Mad Doctor): Still didn't explain why he wasn't in infinity war
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO MOOD MARK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Where was it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but there seemed to be a bit of a disconnect between that and him becoming ~~Ninja Jason Bourne~~ full assassin
Georgia (Something Sensible): How do you think she got so good at shooting, he spent all of infinity war teaching his daughter to shoot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ^
Mark (Mad Doctor): We need a Hawkeye prequel. Or maybe he'll be in the Widow film
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Hawkeye daughter movie when
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WHAT IF IT WAS A DADDY/DAUGHTER FILM
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like Logan
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WHOLESOME AND BADASS
Erik (Red Riot Thot): also I saw something about Scarlet Witch/VIsion series? But taking place in the 50s? I didn't read the full article
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Is vision still dead
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea, right?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Think so.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he died before the snap
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Gotcha
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but what about Loki now that he yeeted off with the cube in 2012
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I want Loki to be alive but idk
Mark (Mad Doctor): So did Loki...wow Erik you beat me to the punch
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it has potential.... it's an alternate past
Mark (Mad Doctor): The Loki series is supposed to be him messing around in history

Georgia (Something Sensible): LMAO
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yea endgame gave me new love for Antman
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bug bois are where it’s at
Erik (Red Riot Thot): funny how the theories that came immediately after Infinity War were correct
Erik (Red Riot Thot): in that they used the quantum realm and time travel
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah
Georgia (Something Sensible): Their talk about quantum made me and Noah’s brains hurt
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it was really the only logical solution
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but I really need to see the Antmans
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm happy my theory of equivalent exchange was real.... even if it wasnt as big of a deal as time travel
Georgia (Something Sensible): I knew the tony death vibe was real
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): You were riiiiiighhht
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the MCU started with him
Erik (Red Riot Thot): only made sense for him to end it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It's weird which comics they pulled from.  Kind of all over the place so it kept us in the dark enough for the end to be a surprise
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i knew cap would get his slap on thanos
Georgia (Something Sensible): i didnt expect the hammer tho
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it was a nice nod to Ultron
ZombieHunter: THE HAMMER WAS SO GOOD
ZombieHunter: and yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): when it budged for Steve
ZombieHunter: When they were trying to move it and when it like. Flinched 😂😂😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): also the "Hail Hydra" line
Erik (Red Riot Thot): from that comic
ZombieHunter: Thor’s 😐 face
Georgia (Something Sensible): YES THE HAIL HYDR
Georgia (Something Sensible): my theater screamed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It was so good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): .... I've found my captain America PJ onsie and I'm never taking it off
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This is my work attire tomorrow
Georgia (Something Sensible): i want to cosplay marvel now
Georgia (Something Sensible): does my life have room for another dead redhead
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm wearing my hoodie tomorrow
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Can we all do marvel cosplays
ZombieHunter: ONE thing bothers me
ZombieHunter: Timeline wise
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'll do captain marvel
Georgia (Something Sensible): _why did we know youd cosplay the one that radiates gay energy_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
ZombieHunter: Killing an early version
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): You know why
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh yeah killing an early version didnt kill the later one
ZombieHunter: Of nebula
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think its cause the timeline isnt linear, it splits
ZombieHunter: Okay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea that was weird for nebula
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Because they were connected
ZombieHunter: Nebula literally killed her past self.
ZombieHunter: But gamora accepted that the future nebula genuinely loves her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like their networks were connected.... I guess maybe it's like the cloud lmao
ZombieHunter: And was like. Yeah sure
ZombieHunter: TEAH THAT
ZombieHunter: That was weird
ZombieHunter: LOL
ZombieHunter: “I connected to my own WiFi and got people@killed”
ZombieHunter: “My b”
ZombieHunter: So
ZombieHunter: End game had three major casualties then
ZombieHunter: Well. The infinity war
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~👀 guys can our next Rwby sized group be marvel~~
ZombieHunter: Someone has to pull in snow
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah
Georgia (Something Sensible): that how nebula worked
ZombieHunter: Yeah
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Snow already does  gamora
Georgia (Something Sensible): /breaks neck ok im ready for our marvel group
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): more like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Georgia (Something Sensible): LOL YEAH
Georgia (Something Sensible): damn scarlet witch kicked butt too

Georgia (Something Sensible): or wasp
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~or groot~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the Groot/Rocket reunion 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Omg I got teary eyed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Rocket begging thor to help him get his family back
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Holy fuck my heart
Georgia (Something Sensible): YES
Georgia (Something Sensible): thor was kinda lame this movie
Georgia (Something Sensible): not a fan of them lame-ing him down
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea not really into thor this movie
Erik (Red Riot Thot): they Peter B. Parkered him
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but not in a good way
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But like ... not as good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like if Peter b parker wasnt hot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was hoping when he went god-mode his muscles would come back
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but alas
Erik (Red Riot Thot): all we got was braided beard
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea the entire movie i was like " isnt he a God? Cant he just... will? His muscles back?"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): why did he become comic relief after Ragnarok? T_T
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I dont know... like ragnarok was so good.. why not harness that? He was still badass in ragnarok
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So why is he like...a loser now?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he was comic relief AND badass in Ragnarok, badass in Infinity War and then just let himself go
Erik (Red Riot Thot): killing Thanos(1) wasn't satisfying and he just lost it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): which I understand, but you'd think he would have gotten himself back together once he agreed to help
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea like.... once they gave him hope?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and I'm sure they could have explained him instantly getting his physique back because he's a god
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Get your shit together man
Erik (Red Riot Thot): like once he harnessed his power and went god-mode, he could have gotten his look™ back
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): He should have
Georgia (Something Sensible): the power of a balanced diet
Georgia (Something Sensible): but yeah he was one of the heaviest hitters in infinity war
Georgia (Something Sensible): now he was like
Georgia (Something Sensible): less badass
Georgia (Something Sensible): also im sorry but captain marvel wasnt very fun either
Georgia (Something Sensible): as one person put it "shes fucked off all movie and then came back to curb stomp a whole ship"
