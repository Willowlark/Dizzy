Erik (Red Riot Thot): OKAY PLOT HOLE TIME
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Rewatching Infinity War
Erik (Red Riot Thot): How is it that in End Game, Red Skull knows Nat's father's name (when she herself never knew)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But in Infinity War, Red Skull calls Gamora "daughter of Thanos" when she had real actual parents?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Heâ€™s not required to refer to them by birth parents.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Nat never did get 'new' parents so she'd still be on the original path whereas gamora had accepted being thanos' daughter so I'm going with that explanation
