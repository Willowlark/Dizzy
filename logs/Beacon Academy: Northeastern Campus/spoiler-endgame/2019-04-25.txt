Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thanks, I hate it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wow... ouch my feels D:
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: So I think Tony's going to survive cause it fits his narrative line 
I dont think iron man is staying tho
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Tony's thing is that he created and is iron man, but the whole point of Age of Ultron, and Ironman 3 is that one day, he doesnt have to be 
Hes been set up as a father figure and mentor for Peter, and his struggles with pepper are about giving up the suit
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Thats why we don't have iron man in the movie pic, we have Tony stark (a distinction made in Iron Man 2 by nick fury)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Captain America on the other hand
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: His character and story have always been about self sacrifice
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And the length he goes to save the innocent in his mind, and Bucky as well, is ridiculous
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Hes perfectly set up for a death, and he has two good successors (winter soldier, and Falcon. Both who have taken up his mantle before)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Plus out of universe, chris Evan's has p clearly shown that hes done with the character, and captain America outside of the avengers and heroing doesnt quite work
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And while RDJ's contract is also up, Tony Stark is very much set up to be a background person and mentor 
More of a guide or Oracle(dc) like figure for the next age of heroes 
Not in the action, but on the sideline offering advice
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Captain Americas story is done, itll definitely come full circle
So is Iron Man
But Tony Stark as a character is not finished story wise imho
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I had one (1) glass of water today. Time to dehydrate myself the rest of the day so I don't have to pee during the movie
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Fucking mood
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.cnet.com/how-to/when-to-pee-during-avengers-endgame-bathroom-break/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): no plot spoilers, but has super vague mini location spoilers
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but basically says the last hour there are NO good times to pee
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Lmao I read that last night and was like " of course New Jersey title card is a good time to pee
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): No one like new jersey
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lmao
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I fucked up and never got around to seeing Captain Marvel so I feel like since she's in it, I might not understand some things
Mark (Mad Doctor): She has a good working relationship with Nick Fury.  Lots of obligations off earth. I think that should cover you for "need to know"
Mark (Mad Doctor): (Makes note to self to change lyric from "Across the river, in Jersey" to "Pee me a river in Jersey...")
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://worldwideinterweb.com/guy-who-stole-the-avengers-endgame-site-pulled-off-a-heist-that-would-make-thanos-proud/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *3 hours for me* ðŸ˜¬

Erik (Red Riot Thot): *2 hours*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -violently shaking with anticipation-
Georgia (Something Sensible): /dry heaves
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'll be seeing Maria Menounous in one hour and some picture thirty minutes after that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): End Game spoiler. Click at your own risk.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Alright Iâ€™m officially not checking this channel until the movie ends
Georgia (Something Sensible): SEE YALL ON THE FLIP SIDE
