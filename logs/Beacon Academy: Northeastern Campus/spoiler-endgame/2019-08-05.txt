Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think it would have sounded cooler without the "I am Iron Man" from the track, but other than that, this is fucking dope
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: that. is exactly my opinion too
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: like it wouldve been cool if they'd positioned the audio so that when tony actually says it, it lines up with where the words should be
thats badass tho
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *now I want the rest of the scene with the rest of the song playing*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Don't think it would have been appropriate for the actual movie because of how emotional the scene is supposed to be (and its aftermath). Not really the "Iron Man comes in to kick ass" mood like the previous movies when AC/DC starts playing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but for an edit of the scene, definitely hella badass
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: black sabbath but acoustic
