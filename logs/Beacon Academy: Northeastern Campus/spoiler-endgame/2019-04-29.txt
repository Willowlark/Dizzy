Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-endgame-spoilers-who-is-the-kid-at-the-en/1100-6466505/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I didn't even notice :O
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omfg i wondered who tf that kid was and now my heart is breaking
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fucking ouch
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh wow Captain Marvel is still in theaters. I would have thought it'd be gone by now O.o
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Gonna go see that Tuesday
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh that's a cute easter egg but oof my heart üò¶
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: so big thing about the 3 hammer strikes
its signifies a lot
its mirroring the start of iron man for one
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: 3 strikes for end of phase 3
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but i read its also apparently supposed to imply iron man isn't gone completely yet?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: so who would take up the mantle?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm betting on iron man 3 kid or his daughter
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: in a movie like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: 5 years from now or something
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There was an article mentioning that maybe the kid from Iron Man 3 (who had a cameo at his funeral) maybe could take on the role
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Makes sense
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Also I'm surprised they actually went the cap aged n passes the shield to falcon route I didn't think they actually would go that storyline
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Guys I am now thinking more about the Steve/Peggy scenes and crying. Holy fuck I love them so much and glad I got to see them together again. Ahhh
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It was such a perfect end to his arc
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It really was. I have so many feels on it. Ughh I love them so much T_T
 And ohh yeee same. I full on thought he was gonna get killed. I am so glad he didn't. Also surprised he gave the shield to Falcon (I know he becomes Cap at some point) but I was expecting it to go to Bucky next since he becomes Cap in comics at some point lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Welcome to Marvel comics where thes a million universes and they're all canon <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeeeeppp lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm still shocked I managed to not cry but a single tear. I held my shit together... somehow like I'm a cry baby.. HOW
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Guys I'm still crying over Endgame
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Endgame almost doubled Infinity War for opening weekend holy shit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): holy crap
Erik (Red Riot Thot): wow so I saw a meme post about not spoiling End Game. Checked the comments and immediately saw this
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and then another comment: *"I ruined that movie for so many people. Loved every minute of it üòÇ"*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): people are dicks wtf
Erik (Red Riot Thot): another gem from the comments of a different post: *"The most unbelievable part of this movie was people still playing fortnight five years in the post apocalyptic future"*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wtf
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i hate humanity
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): on the other hand i have a serious question
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because the part where clint turns into a literal fucking ninja cracked me up SO fucking much
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....quick question
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): does hawkeye naruto run?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -clint sees one episode of naruto-

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol nah. I'll do whatever. I got a million Genbents from the Marvel Universe I can choose from so ya'll decide and then I'll decide what the hell Imma do closer to Katsu XD
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Also we could just. NYC trip the same weekend as NYCC so it's less weird to be in the city in cosplay
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm trying to look up WWII era British officer costumes for GB Peggy but every site is like THIS IS A RENTAL COSTUME
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: That's uhhhhh first weekend October
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): *I wanna destroy NYC*
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Hulk smash Monica?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): üòÇüòÇüòÇ noooo
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Loki
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Nice
Georgia (Something Sensible): MONICA WE CAN DO THE BIT FROM RAGNAROK
Georgia (Something Sensible): "help me sister!!"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol Erik, I'll see if Trav knows any sites to buy stuff like that off of. Ooorr I can see if I can find the site I got mine from (they had a million military unifors to buy from sooo)
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Mmmmm yes
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Mark has to be Frigga he's already done Odin
Rebecca (madameterralupus): https://onlinemilitaria.net/default.asp
<@!386874959009415170> This is where I got my Peggy Uniform years ago. They should have something similar that you can get/modify for a genbent cause they have all genders and different branches
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Someone tell me to not make iron Man I'll cry when things don't work
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Also I'd have to worbla everything
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anna plz don't kill yourself over doing iron man lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Sees erik is interested in peggy
me: üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~toying with the idea~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Me as bucky <:pewish:420824457918152704>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): still
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~still would probably want to do Black Widow for GB group~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ~~well we need someone to represent the only non man now a man~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): http://onlinemilitaria.net/products/5993-UK-Army-Officer-WWI-Post-1916-and-WWII-Service-Dress-Uniform-Package/
~~only $275~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Welcome to buying military gear my friend! üòÑ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's expense and kills me lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Thats within ur sewing capabilities tho if u wanted
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Not the tailoring part wait that's a  rEPLICA AND IT COSTS THAT MUCH WHAT
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Time to go look through heritage patterns my friend
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yeee even replica/reproduced military items are expense. Imagine what the actual shit from that era costs... üëÄ
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Asgsgxjfhdg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Exactly lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: To be fair it's also probably wool fabric
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that is *not* within my sewing capabilities
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Most likely
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *Our uniforms are made in khaki wool barathea*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but lowkey, the clothes I buy for Black Widow would probs add up anyway xD
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ~~i was just going off the fabric texture LMAO woo guessed right~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: To wig or not to wig seems to be the answer
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yee most uniforms like that were wool back then. And it's awwwwful feeling
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was thinking it'd be cool to do Endgame wog but that would be very difficult to achieve.... can't bleach tips of red wog and dying roots of blonde wog would look like garbage
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Cowbutt says alchohol markers 
I say suffering
Georgia (Something Sensible): Copic markers is what silhouettecosplay did
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh alcohol markers could maybe work... just go weft by weft
Erik (Red Riot Thot): rip
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lmao
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Yep! Welcome to hell
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee I was jsut gonna mention that too Georgia lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Less suffering than long wig
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: But still
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Short wig is dense
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~remembers I gotta do that for Adam wig.. cries~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Oh no
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Is your Adam wig blonde or
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Nah it's red. I just gotta do his weird brown streaks he has
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So not as much work but ehh I've never done such a thing so... yikes XD
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I feel u could skip that honestly
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I probs could but I hate myself sooo
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Or put very few 
Good news is if you fuck up just rubbing alcohol it out
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee I'm not gonna do many. Just a few to give it his look and such.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.copicmarker.com/collections/collect
Erik (Red Riot Thot): now to choose a color <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ..i do markers for all my wigs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:rip:378273525804433408>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ask silhouette what they used lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): Wigs are such a challenge oof
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont use copics though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i use the alcohol markers from michaels
Erik (Red Riot Thot): smort
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that are like 2 dollars a piece
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I hate wigs... But also like working on them at the same time. It's a complicated relationship... I just gonna get better at them though lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): or like 1.50 or something
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh I still have that other blonde wig from when I bought two colors for my Tai 3.0 wig
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that I never returned
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and has since passed it's return date
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): coloring it is tedious
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but
Georgia (Something Sensible): O so we doin endgame outfit then?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if you color the roots to a certain stopping point and then use rubbing alcohol to drag it out towards the end it creates a good gradient
Georgia (Something Sensible): _time for chonky thor_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol if we do endgame versions Georgia's gotta do beer gut Thor XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay honestly everytime Thor was on screen during the movie we couldn't keep a straight face. It was just so funny... omggg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also never did I think they could make Chris Hemsworth... not hot.. YET they did... omg
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nope still hot LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): I like cowbuttcruchies fem thor
Georgia (Something Sensible): Definitely taking inspiration from them
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was just saying Endgame for me because I think it'd be neat. I was just gonna do generic Black Widow look
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If I do Genbent Strange I could probs ask Momochi for advice cause I know she did a version of him and it looks awesome~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Sorry my dad called uhhhhh u can also paint in the acrylic inks with a paintbrush
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Cheaper
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wanna ventilate a wig so the hairline looks natural
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ~~speakknf of that my tools come today. Georgia let's both suffer yaaaay~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): wouldn't really need the gradient since it's supposed to be grown out roots ~~even though it'd probably look hella nicer~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea gonna be real with ya'll, if you ever plan to do roots on a wig, you gotta gradient it at least a little
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Seconded
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because otherwise it looks too blunt
Erik (Red Riot Thot): noted
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and makes it look MORE like a wig
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Unless u tryna rlly go for 'i fried my hair'
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): even if its grown out roots, hair grows unevenly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so theres always a slight gradient
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: N that can be just like. Light touches with a second marker to do the gradient
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, oh good point. if you color a wig always use at LEAST two shades of marker or ink
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it gives it dimension
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Side note I gotta say I screamed In happy when black panther came back from the snappening
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh mood
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Oof mood Leanna let's not talk about how much purple is in my shinsou wig
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I lost count
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yangs wig has 7 shades of yellow and gold in it
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Need to just add some more hairline the hairy banana did not work. 

Oof mood mine is around 4 if I count the wefts' being a diff color
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: So who was disappointed btw that nebula didn't get to kill thanos at least once
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i used at least 5 of each marker
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I RLLY wanted nebula to at least get a hit in on thanos but also I guess that she just stood by while he died was justice enough
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: OH FUCK I REALIZED A THING BACK TO ENDGAME
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Dr strange tells Tony if he tells him what timeline they're in it won't happen.. because..... Either he's unsure if Tony would sacrifice himself. Or he actually can't and hes standing there knowing what happens and can't tell anyone. And. Either way. He knows he's in the right timeline. And Tony is going to die and he can't tell him 
Fuck
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Damn if doctor strange can look at his teammate knowing he's gonna die and not spoil it. Everyone can avoid spoiling it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:valid:420824413592748032>
Georgia (Something Sensible): I have so much Easter candy I really could be endgame thor
Georgia (Something Sensible): Time 2 start
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *no u don't wanna have to make another pyrrha corset*
Georgia (Something Sensible): FUCK ur rightness
Mark (Mad Doctor): Endgame Pyrrha in bathrobe, sweats, and fuzzy slippers
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): in that moment everyone became a lesbian
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP
Erik (Red Riot Thot): YUP
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Protec the cinnamon roll
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I screamed at that scene. I was like yassss bitch!! üôåüèª
Evie (Katheryne Knight): All the girls (including me) cheered in the theater
Mark (Mad Doctor): I read an article that dissed that scene, claiming it was fanservice that ignored weak female roles in Marvel's past. I have yet to meet a single person, young or old, male or female, who wasn't inspired by that moment. The Avengers were born in the sixties and have evolved since then. I think the cheers were for the present and future.
Georgia (Something Sensible): The whole Rutgers theater cheered, can confirm
Erik (Red Riot Thot): we all cheered for the Stan Lee cameo
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I loved that moment
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Like, captain marvel 100% could have gotten through the army on her own
But like ALLL THE MARVEL LADIES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am so glad my dad doesn't care about spoilers so I can verbally vent about my feelings on this movie to someone face to face XD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: talkin bout valkyrie
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~also valkyrie meets captain marvel and they fall in love when~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: also
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: valkyrie like damn. carry me off on your pegasus pls
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think the actresses said they shipped it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its super cute
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: concept wise they both match eachothers previous loves
Mark (Mad Doctor): I totally see them trashing a bar together
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Also i know everybody wants Captain marvel to end up in a gay relationship but like 
I also would really be happy if they did end up going her Captain Marvel x War Machine route 
Cause they are super cute and great in the comic
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: like 
Cap Marvel is screaming gay energy 
but that is a pairing in current MCU that I would also be perfectly happy with
Jamie (Jamie): FUCK that was a fucking emotional roller coaster
Jamie (Jamie): üò≠ üò≠ üò≠
Jamie (Jamie): But amazong fucking movie
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEA
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ITS SO GREAT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but also ow
Jamie (Jamie): That end though of the actor credits doing special credits with autographs of the OG avengers
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YO right? that was so cool
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i was still crying about steve and peggy but i was still hella appreciating that
Jamie (Jamie): Im still crying damnit
Jamie (Jamie): That was great
Jamie (Jamie): Thinking about Tony makes me cry more
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): god ok when peter hugged him
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fjkskjslaf
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FUCK
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right?? T_T Peter already lost uncle Ben. now Tony?? DAMMIT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IT WAS SO SAAAAAAAAAAAAADDD
Mark (Mad Doctor): I really want to see Far From Home now to see how Peter deals with the loss
Jamie (Jamie): Oh my god yea and potts saying they were all gon a be okay and he can rest now. My tears turned to waterfall mode
Jamie (Jamie): Also gardians galaxy 3. Is gonna include thor??
Mark (Mad Doctor): A friend of mine put his 18yo cat down last week. The last thing he told her was that she can rest now. When Pepper said that line he bawled like a baby, alarming the other theater goers
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh no, omg thats so sad
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *i didnt cry during endgame but im gonna fucking cry now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh same.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was talking to my dad about it earlier and almost started to cry
Jamie (Jamie): Worst part is this the day after watching fucking GoT last night like fuck
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Is *Far From Home* supposed to be post *Endgame*? I was reading articles asking how they were going to deal with the 5 year gap in *Far From Home*
Jamie (Jamie): Wait that makes me think cause yea none of his classmates should still be in high school
Jamie (Jamie): And they had him hig dude friend at the end but like...
Mark (Mad Doctor): According to my sources (obsessive teenage Tom Holland fans), Far From Home begins immediately after Endgame. Perhaps all of Peter's friends got snapped, too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what 5 year gap?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nvm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
