Georgia (Something Sensible): i would consider doing it, if only for the memes
Erik (slendergiant): Anyone planning on doing the school uniform? I kind of want to just scour Goodwills for a light gray blazer because it would be pretty easy to add the stripes and buttons. The only thing I'd really have to add would be the shoulder straps

Erik (slendergiant): HappyAcorn does the full pink bodysuit method for her Mina
Jess (whoozica): Oh yea! It's a viable option
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I‚Äôve thought about something lile@thay for Widowmaker and then I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs gonna look tacky‚Äù
