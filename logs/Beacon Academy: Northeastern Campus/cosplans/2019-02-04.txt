Jamie (Jamie): Im being taunted
Jamie (Jamie): Worst is that it looks done *but its not*
Jess (whoozica): its like "some finish me you coward"
Jamie (Jamie): Yes and my list for her is the longest yet alot of it is small 20-40 minute things to complete
Jamie (Jamie): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OOF
Jamie (Jamie): I mean at. Least i have all these ~~unpaid~~ days off from work this week to work on it
Jess (whoozica): god i wish that were me
Jess (whoozica): i mean i need money but...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A big mood lol
Jamie (Jamie): Its a blessing and a curse on my bank <:imdyingsquirtle:378261448838610944>
Jamie (Jamie): Also serious question i need help figuring out how to do these boot covers cause trying to do them last night i wants to cut them up and stab things violently
Marisa (Mawisa): What do you need help with on boot covers?
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~Mr. Han your assistant called she said she wants her life back~~
Something about this cosplay feels really off and I can‚Äôt figure out why
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Lack of tie?
Marisa (Mawisa): She doesn‚Äôt have a tie. Sometimes she has a lanyard
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i have no idea what you're from tbh
Marisa (Mawisa): Mystic mess!
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Marisa (Mawisa): I know the front of the wig needs that floof thing
Marisa (Mawisa): Maybe I have to be more professional
Someone enroll me in another business course and schedule some pointless meetings
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u need to look more exhausted
Marisa (Mawisa): It‚Äôs one of the Sunday Katsu costumes so that should take care of the exhaustion
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah theres too much life in ur eyes
Jamie (Jamie): <@301927856240459777> its mainly the connecting and shaping to the show itself because the leg portion is easy being just baggy tube of fabric that is gonna be held up via ribbon
Marisa (Mawisa): Yee. I‚Äôm using thermoplastic to shape the shoe and molding it over my foot if you have any plastic pellets
Jamie (Jamie): No i dont I'm trying to just use fabric over the shoe (gonna buy different ones today too if i can cause ones i have not comfy on the toes)
Jamie (Jamie): I tried the masking tape method but it did not work for me very well
Marisa (Mawisa): Oooo
Is it stretchy fabric? You could try sewing it on while wearing the shoe
Jamie (Jamie): No im using a denim since the top part isnt supposed to be skin tight otherwise this would prolly be much easier (white denim)
Jamie (Jamie): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): do u have a fabric bit for the bottom or are u doing the side side sandwich method
Jamie (Jamie): Side sandwich or drape so i can keep the sole of the shoes to avoid slipping
Jamie (Jamie): I want to eventually do them using a pleather like material later but i just need this to work for me for katsu oof
Jamie (Jamie): Would treating it like making socks work you think?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u gonna have to give up the sole bit
Anna (loud and likely blonde): or, what worked for me
Anna (loud and likely blonde): cut it like you're going to make a bottom of shoe part
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and instsead of that u glue very very carefully around the side of the tread adn just rip it off later when u wanna update
Anna (loud and likely blonde): youll end up with bagging at the toe and tight on the side if you treat it like socks
Jamie (Jamie): What glue you use? I tried gorrilla but it wasnt holding well or even getting tacky on the fabric
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~hot glue~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): honestly i use contact cement
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you can also pin it in with tiny tacks while its drying
Jamie (Jamie): Contact cement *face palms* I forgot its existence fuck
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lmfao honestly i use it for things i shouldnt
Jamie (Jamie): Lol hey if it works *it works*
Jamie (Jamie): And when i get home later gonna try using your advise and make it happen somehow
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea careful tho cause it dries yellow. so u might have to run an edge afterwards but you can just use fabric glue to glue the fabric to fabric
Anna (loud and likely blonde): would suggest putting on the shoe and re-trying duct tape method toh
Jamie (Jamie): Duct tape method?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): saran wrapping to make the shapes
Jamie (Jamie): Yea thats wjat i tried last night and dont know if i fucked it up or not but it made me feel stabby
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and counting the bottom of the shoe as a shape (that you wouldnt make in fabric but is important to cut and remove)
Anna (loud and likely blonde): put on the shoe and pants and saran wrap it 2x and then go in with small duct tape pieces
Anna (loud and likely blonde): its how i got my super annoying boot covers for grimm yang done
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~and georgia's sewing machine which was a blessing~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also, give yourself seam allowance
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): otherwise once you sew those pieces together they wont fit on the shoes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah actually give urself more than that in the rear of the shoe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like give yourself a LOT of seam alowance because you can always wake them smaller
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but not bigger
Jamie (Jamie): Yea i tend to leave too much allowance in case of any fuck up on things im trying for the first time
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so you can actually rotate your ankle. The geting the shoe in wont be as bad if you put it in via the bottom and glue it on
Jess (whoozica): white garbage bag + red duct tape üëå
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im getting lipstick in my valentino white bag vibes with that sentence
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Assistant Kang, please make sure that nothing bad happens to Elizabeth the 3rd
Erik (Red Riot Thot): frick, I might have just added another cosplay to my Katsu lineup
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh god, what did you add
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): with a week and a half left
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): üëÄ
Jess (whoozica): WHAT IS IT
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Might do James Thursday night after Darling
Anna (loud and likely blonde): jamesl ike
Anna (loud and likely blonde): what james
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because Will (White Fang) is doing Sirius and has a friend doing Remus
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Potter
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH hp
Anna (loud and likely blonde): o that james
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not james from pokemon
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LmAO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i was also thinking james from pokemon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No so it's a cosplay I already have. Just means bringing another costume lol
Jamie (Jamie): Okay guys opinion on a dress cuz it will need major adjustment to not spill bewbs everywhere but otherwise?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): who for?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): its cute but you def gonna have to restrain the bewbs
Jamie (Jamie): Not sure who it would be honestly but its like little shorts underneath and its great
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i would go for it if its comfy
Jess (whoozica): A camisole underneath could prob contain da tit
Jamie (Jamie): Thats what I'm thinking and i can cut the back of camisole so the back criss cross still looks good.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Someone i follow on twitter finished her updated cinder outfit for katsu like
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Galaxy Queen?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wtf thats so quick
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it looks funkin' good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how the fuck do some of ya'll churn out cotumes like theyre nothing
Anna (loud and likely blonde): its the homestuck running in their veins
Marisa (Mawisa): homestuck and no life
Erik (Red Riot Thot): didn't the homestucks used to pull updated costumes out of their asses the day a new one came out? during the con?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yes
Marisa (Mawisa): oh yeah
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i mean some of them like. were simple
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but they have evolved
Marisa (Mawisa): one girl made grimdark jane the day it came out during nycc, on a saturday at the con
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah i remember that
Jamie (Jamie): Homestucks have actual supernatural powers it was a great time
Anna (loud and likely blonde): honestly you had to in order to get through the series

Marisa (Mawisa): do i have photographic evidence of you in homestuck
Marisa (Mawisa): *was that you*
