Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I'm using this old Harley wig I never use to make my toga!!
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): 
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): What you all think?
Jess (whoozica): THATS PERFECT
Mark (Mad Doctor): Toga and Harley: the buddy road trip picture you know you want to see
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!229713389511901185> you want to talk to <@!301927856240459777>
Marisa (Weeb): How do you fit less than 9 cosplays at s con
Marisa (Weeb): If space is the issue you can take them to the con in a storage tote instead of a suitcase owo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s mostly changing out, putting on more make up, etc. My big issue is I HATE doing make up so much
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And having to put on an entirely different face is just
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also Storage tote OwO?
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i used to not do a lot of makeup so i'd just change in and out real fast with not a lot of issue
now i tend to. not do a lot of intricate makeup unless it's needed, and ill try to stick characters with similar faces/makeup into the same day's lineup. or i space them out enough where redoing makeup isnt that annoying
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I try to sync up make up, like A2 and Fallout cosplay both have dirty faces with blue eyes so that’ll be a good change
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s my biggest issue is sticking to characters with similar make up. 

Because of how shit ends up working out. Like Katsu was a mess because of how autograph sessions and photo shoots played out for me. 

Hoping this year they’ll be more planned out
Jess (whoozica): 👆  you could do it in a way that you can "build" on your makeup throughout the day, start with your simplist and then build and switch out things like eyebrows and stuff
Jess (whoozica): Yeaaaaa the photoshoots and meetups are so hard to plan for 😭
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like if I wanna bring my Ochako cosplay with me I’d do her the same day as Summer (cause they both have cute faisu’s OwO)
Jess (whoozica): Yea!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And my cosplans got a bit fucked up cause of moving so I’m like “Summer and Winter are my only plans what do I do for everything in between”
Jess (whoozica): ~~fall and spring~~
Jess (whoozica): Ok that was bad
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I’m tempted to buy a vault suit and do my Fallout Sole Survivor
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ~~fall, cinder~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~don’t tempt me I low key wanna do Cinder~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~but that’s more m o n e y~~
