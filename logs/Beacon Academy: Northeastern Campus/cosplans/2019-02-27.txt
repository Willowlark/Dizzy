Anna (loud and likely blonde): Would anyone. Know anyone who wants a tutorial/pattern for present mic's stupid hair because I can only find paid ones and I know I like free things
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I am making this for a commission... does $70-$80 seems too much?? ~~Calculated up to that much after looking at material costs and estimating my labor time on it.~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ii personally think thats reasonable
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like more than reasonable actually
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay. Cause like most of the materials I get from work and I can get a discount on them so the extra from that can cover more labor fees too if needed I feel?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have one (1) point of experience you can use, but I got a 3d printed gun and that ran me 120 bucks. So the fact that you have to do this as a unique thing (not reprint the original design) could even add to it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But. 100 bucks is probably safe to actually make the sale.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So ya think I should u my estimated cost more to closer to that? Like 70-80 is too low? ~~I am so bad at estimating costs lol. I feel I always under charge myself...~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea like if i were to commission that i would fully expect to be paying 100+ ngl
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okii lol. Thanks your your advice ya'll~ ðŸ˜›
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I've never priced anything myself, but give yourself the hourly rate, and hours estimate, that's you labor charge... then add cost of materials... Then you could factor in time (if it's a rush job), special requests (fee for the additional challenge, work on your part)... things like that. 

Your invoice cost is cost of materials. You do the work for free at invoice, basically. Never go below that. Your list price is when you add all those fees in. The price you actually offer can be plus minus of the list price. Drop a fee to be nice, make a little extra money if they're particularly demanding, etc etc.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *then if you're IBM you do a historical analysis using a regression model of your sales and use that to optimize your price*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You can also add some kind of markup on material cost. Like, at work we mark up material cost 20%. Probably a bit high for what you're doing but since you can get materials at a discount, definitely give them the non-discounted price *at least*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh true. That covers wasted material too.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yea I definitely am. I am writing down the materials needed at the listed price n the shelves, not what I'll get them at with my discount lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So like estimating my materials (not labor hours or etc) they already come to $52-ish dollars lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): AAAlso keep in mind that there will be a point that someone will walk. Try and guess their budget. If you really want to making the sale, paying yourself 7 dollars rather than 8 an hour may be required to keep them from walking.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh yea, good point. you should ask them what their budget is tbh
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That opens the opportunity to undersell what they have though.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Valid. Thankfully this girl doesn't have a budget it seems? Just wants to do payment plans which I am fine with.
When I take them I always ask the following... item, pictures of it, budget, when needed
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *My reccetear days are coming back to me*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Yee she has no budget. Looked again.~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Payment plan as in she doesn't get it till she pays it all off right...?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *okay good*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Learned that damn mistake years ago after a friend never fucking payed me for a damn good prop I did >.> ~~over 7 years later, still don't see that money.~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~some friend, huh~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Oh definitely. Thus is why she was kicked to the curb <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> ~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Didn't need to do that, but better than working.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Took me like, 5 minutes just to get the one on, but I got the chonky boots
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *looks sharp my dude*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): advise on some thick af socks for the first couple or dozen times you wear them tho if they're real leather
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh yeah definitely
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i may have finally worn my new timbs and may be regretting my sock choice rn
Anna (loud and likely blonde): save urself
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ooo wait i remember you saying you were tryna incorporate the purple. did u decide if you wanted to switch out the laces?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~im so focused at work guys~~
Jess (whoozica): Oo those are nice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Probably
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Gotta unlace them to see how long I need to buy them
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i need help making a potentially bad decision.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ooh I can help convince you to do it. What's up?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): do i. stick with the like *thigh high* platform combat boots i already own for mic. Or. Do i buy... these........

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Free the foreheaaaaddd
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I have a problem with blonde wigs. I have waaaaay too many. I need to do a count.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Everyone here is a blonde wig addict apparently. you can't just get one
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~I guess what they say is true, blondes have more fun~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have a problem with black wigs XD I have so many.
it used to be blonde wigs yearsss ago
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Sad part is I know I'm going to need another blonde wig this year cuz I'm planning to do BotW Zelda finally and I'm just thinking to myself, why am I like this?
