Mark (Mad Doctor): I think I missed the window between "too cold to spray paint" and "too hot and humid to spray paint"
snow ( crescentbladed ): there is no window
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If I could do everything inside I would buy the basement is off limits since that’s where my cat eats and poops.
Georgia (Something Sensible): It's better to paint cold than hot I learned from my chem teacher in high school
Georgia (Something Sensible): The heat makes it more likely for the paint to reject the surface of the prop
snow ( crescentbladed ): Good to know o:
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Good luck finding somewhere cold*
Erik (slendergiant): Paint-on plastidip and acrylic paint ftw ✌🏻
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ok well if your choices are a desert and a freezer just a heads up that the freezer is better lol
Jess (whoozica): Also don't leave spray paint in the sun cuz I think it can technically explode?
