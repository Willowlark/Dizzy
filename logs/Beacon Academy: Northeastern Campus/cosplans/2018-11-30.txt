Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think I'm done with the mask?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damnnn that looks really good Erik!! 😱
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Very nice 👌
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good job with the paint. I'll bet you fool some of the normies at konkon
Mark (Mad Doctor): Probably won't do cosplay at Pax Unplugged tomorrow, given that it's likely to rain and my DnD squad has plans for breakfast and lunch in Chinatown a few blocks away
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think imma get this to wear to Kon Kon. Now the question is  do I still do Denki or do I do Deku??
