Erik (Red Riot Thot): RIP some of the metallic red paint from my Kiri boots peeled off onto my Blake boots and I'm not sure how to get it off
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: UHHHHH this is gonna sound weird but try first using painters tape or gaffers tape or even duct tape to take it off like u would wax hair 
If that doesn't work. We keep brainstorming
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Like. Maybe even a strong lint roller
Erik (Red Riot Thot): no luck :/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): will research more tomorrow
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Rip. I'll see if I can find anything too. You might have to like. Brush something on and peel it off like flexbond. Or it might come off if you apply a bit of heat. Are they real leather boots?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I need to start working on my stuff but MOTIVATION
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it says "vegan leather" so I'mma say no lol
ZombieHunter: LOL
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: FUCK YEA JIROUS DONE
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Well I need to get her ear Jack's but idk where I can get 6.5mm stereo plugs

Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wouldn't 1/4" jacks be kind of big?
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Not really? Also I need the one with the weird spike on the end
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: 
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Also still. What freaking color is her hair. Is it blue black? Dark purple? I went with deep indego cause I'm sick of tryna color this wig
Erik (Red Riot Thot): what you have looks pretty good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but going back to the plugs, she uses them to listen to her ipod/phone which would indicate they'd be 3.5mm 
~~but you're allowed to do the cosplay however you want so just ignore me~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: See I was gonna do that bc of that logic but I dont think bulb tipped 3.5mm jacks exist? I never found any. 
Also I figured since I can't actually plug them into my phone for cute/funny pics I'd try to make them a larger size to show up better in photos 
I might just give up If I can't find them at this Best buy tho
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *someone thought this was my real hair*
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I will take that as a compliment

Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): how much is thread at jo-anns? like, more than a dollar?
we've had stockpiles and giant baskets of thread for years and it's finally running out so idk if it's cheaper to try and buy online or go to a store
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): we still have thread but it's random colors like pink and purple and blue not black/white essentials
