Anna (loud and likely blonde): https://www.arda-wigs.com/products/kryolan-color-spray
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but like. Blue black will be cute. and easily recognized via the leg engines
Marisa (Mawisa): w o a h
i wonder if it's any better than the party city stuff because that's a chonky hair spray
Anna (loud and likely blonde): it seems to be bc kryolan usually v good. i watched the tutorial and like. it appears to be less chonk more fine and obvs a little crunchy but less chonky
Marisa (Mawisa): **crunchy hair spray**
Marisa (Mawisa): crunchy rainbow hair
Anna (loud and likely blonde): well. any hairspray gonna be crunchy

idk ðŸ¤”
Marisa (Mawisa): it looks more blue in person but it comes out more black in totally unedited unfiltered pictures like that
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): V IIDA.
Marisa (Mawisa): i'd have to put gel in the braids to keep them from falling apart but if this works it'd save me from having to buy a new wig
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i feel like. u need longer braid. like the dangan ronpa? chick but like. iida would also short hair for ease of movement.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~if u flatiron the braids it helps u need less gel~~
Marisa (Mawisa): oooo yeah like toko's braids. long!
i wanna find pictures of like 50s japanese schoolgirls i feel like iida would have an old fashioned hair style like that. but then again he doesn't slick his hair back so maybe not
Marisa (Mawisa): i have a book on the history of japanese school girls but idk where it is
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ngl i was kinda sad when he never got that hair style he would look good
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like he looked good when they were all swimsuits n his hair was up in a cap?? idk his face looks good when his hair isnt in it. more serious.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Also like. is this book. in english by any chance.

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Soooooo
I just realized I can use my Borb as a prop if I cosplay Jester
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Should I try to attach the mask/hoodie permanently to the jacket?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Why not add snappers instead?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cause I can't sew xD
Marisa (Mawisa): velcro? :3c
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm that could work. Why didn't I think of that xD derp
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Rebecca I think. U have proven u can sew. 

Also u do em by hand LMAO 

But I think you don't want it permanently attached just for the convenience of being able to take off the hood
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD how and when?? I've only sewed something once and I had someone standing me over me the whole time LOL. 
And ehh I'm now wearing it over my face just letting it hang. But I may try the Velcro method yeee.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd do snaps but I'm not great at hand sewing either xD RIO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Sounds like we gotta fix this and indoctrinate u into the sewing crew
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Halp there's a BNHA pj party at toracon what would shinsou wear for PJ'S
All I can think of is like. The baggiest gray pants and a graphic tee but. What would the graphic tee look like

Anna (loud and likely blonde): take the shot, bite the bullet, join the painted face crew
