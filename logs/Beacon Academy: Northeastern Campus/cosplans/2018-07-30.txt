Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I need lavender or lilac for krolia
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Full arm with fingers
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): 
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): And to make her face lines I have ears so I can paint them
Marisa (Weeb): these guys the best for tights, you can make arm socks from them
https://www.welovecolors.com/shop/tights.htm
Marisa (Weeb): and for face paint, ben nye ~~just like homestuck~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^^^
Jess (whoozica): are they durable? i need thigh highs that will hold up in the water park for 2b i had ome from amazon last year that did the trick but i feel like that was pure luck
Marisa (Weeb): here a good site for ben nye, they have a ton of colors at a pretty good price
https://www.cosplaysupplies.com/store.php?p=ABCL
Marisa (Weeb): what do you mean by hold up, not fall down? or not change color in water? or not break?
Jess (whoozica): not tear ont he rough floor of the water park and yea staying up too XD
Marisa (Weeb): oooooooooooooooooooooooo i didn't even think about the rough floor. that's a tough.
maybe you could stick a plastic sole on the bottom of the tights, like one of these
https://www.amazon.com/Clear-Sole-Protector-Sneakers-Protection/dp/B01N57MZYW/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1532963407&sr=8-5&keywords=clear%2Bsole&dpID=41vdUXKBEbL&preST=_SX300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&th=1
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Because if they aren't on your thigh, they're liehighs*
Marisa (Weeb): to stay up you could either sew 'em to another pair of tights, or add extra elastic around the top. sock glue is super helpful but not good in water
Marisa (Weeb): ah but the plastic soles are stick-on. hm. if you go that route you may need to glue it on with some waterproof glue, which will be tricky because you need to stretch the bottom of the tight but you don't want to glue it to your foot.
steal a mannequin.
Jess (whoozica): the one i have for her right now (just regular hanes brand) are great at staying up but they are thin and will probably tear the second i walk on the rough floor, the one i had last year were durable but didnt stay up XD
Marisa (Weeb): OR make it a sandal kind of thing where there's a thin band going over the top of your foot to keep the plastic sole on
Jess (whoozica): i have other one that came this the costume maybe ill try those
Jess (whoozica): ill just bring like 40 pairs
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Thank you ♡
Marisa (Weeb): wear all 40 at the same time
Jess (whoozica): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>

Georgia (Something Sensible): Rational self: you probably shouldn't try to remake something when you fly out in less than 48 hours
Georgia (Something Sensible): Caveman brain: remake thigh armor
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): New one is on the left, it doesn't fall down at ALL so I'm hella pleased
Mark (Mad Doctor): So is there a trick to securing leg armor? My iron Man pieces fit pretty well but start to slide down my leg after a dozen steps
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): A complicated one.
