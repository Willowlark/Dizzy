Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey so like does anyone know any tutorials on doing Jirou's ear plug things? I can't find any anywhere. I was just gonna buy cheap earphones and cut the chords off and glue them to old earrings but idk
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I'm gonna get fake ear cuffs that go around my whole ear n glue em on but I haven't found a tutorial either ;-;
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Im crazy and I'm gonna try and paint them skin tone but I'll let u know if I find anything
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): My friend went the lazy route and just tucked the aux cord under her wig cap and behind the ear when she did Jirou
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Good idea 
See I'm dumb and was gonna be extra and try and make them actually retract
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Ohhh that sounds cool though if you can figure it out
Georgia (Something Sensible): maybe if you glued the output thing to one of those retractable yoyos
