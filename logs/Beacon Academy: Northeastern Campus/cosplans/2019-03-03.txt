Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I'm always down for more BnHA genderbends.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Also, Arda released a new ombre wig perfect for Summer Rose. It's $105 ðŸ™ƒ
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Granted, it's lacefront, but still ~~this is why I avoid buying from them~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): YIKES
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~so I guess I should buy that bnha girl uniform secondhand bc. Shinsou wig is at my house
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Hmm. I wonder what genderbend I should do next. I would do Kiri but I'm not ready for shirtless sleeves XD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Maybe Amajiki cuz he's my spirit animal. Any suggestions?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Oh my God pls I love Amajiki so m u c h
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Can we pull off an entire group of genderbend bnha characters? I think so. 
Everybody flop. 
Except thirteen. We need a thirteen to just. Exist as is.
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH GENDERBEND PARTY
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Well idk what heads they measuring on but my lacefront for shinsou is. VERY TIGHT
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Also JFC my bnha gym uniform came and. I ordered XL 
And. It's VERY TIGHT ON TOP
Jess (whoozica): yea the top on mine is tight too
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Hopefully. Sports bra will help
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~oh wait I'm wearing a binder IM DUMB~~
Marisa (Mawisa): ðŸ‘€
would this genderbend be school uniforms, gym uniforms, or hero uniforms?
my first instinct was 'i wanna do genderbend aoyama' but then i remembered iida has glasses so if you need an iida ðŸ‘€
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Omfg pls do iida I love him
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Idk I want the school uniforms personally
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I love so many characters. I.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Guess we should vote on school or gym
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm downto do any uniform lol. I pan to do Hero suit GB Bakugo but can do other outfits as well
Marisa (Mawisa): i karate chop the air
Marisa (Mawisa): i'd prefer school uniforms also but anything is cool
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i need to know what Shinso's hero uniform looks like before I make it~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): It's ok I already have GB mic
Marisa (Mawisa): shinso's hero outfit: revealed
Anna (loud and likely blonde): So we make the hero suits and buy them school uniforms
Mark (Mad Doctor): Iida seems like he would be really fun to cosplay
Anna (loud and likely blonde): LMFAO I am. Cry
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Iida is a delight but also. Those who wear his hero uniform. Mobility looks so limited
Marisa (Mawisa): his engines are gonna be tricky in a school uniform but i got that cool wax that blends in with my skin so that'll be really helpful
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Litty
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Or u just wear the high socks
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Mawisa would be a good Iida. You can run around and tell everyone to stop shaming UA with their shinanigans.
Marisa (Mawisa): would he have short hair as a girl or have nerdy braids
Marisa (Mawisa): school regulation hair
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm thinking bangs
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): google shows lots of braids.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Very Tonari no Kaibutsu esk.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~girl but still ripped as FUCK~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): YES
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I'm. Here for girls who can suplex me
Marisa (Mawisa): that's me
Marisa (Mawisa): deku's all might bento cover :0
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~marisa ppl ship shinso and iida we can make memes~~
Marisa (Mawisa): female bakugo would be tomo-chan
Marisa (Mawisa): do they really :0
shinso could help enforce iida's school policies it's genius
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I love how uraraka just looks like he never bothered to cut his hair
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yes they do it's cute
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I kinda ship casually
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): lol tomo.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I was gonna do a hero outfit for Todo but Iâ€™d also be down for gym uniformzzz
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Why not both ðŸ‘€
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): sounds like it's school uniform majority tho.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh yeah I guess that too
Georgia (Something Sensible): School uniform on Amazon is 50, gym uniform is 37
Marisa (Mawisa): school uniform $20 on ali
Georgia (Something Sensible): I never really trusted Ali if only cause I heard a couple stories of people getting screwed over
Georgia (Something Sensible): Is it okay?
Marisa (Mawisa): yeah i order from it constantly
Marisa (Mawisa): only ever been ripped off like, twice, and they were for really obscure wigs. one wound up getting lost in the mail and showing up 4 months later (i think I did get a refund on it), and the other the person never shipped so their shop shut down and i got a full refund. but i buy supplies from them weekly and put in hundreds of orders.
Marisa (Mawisa): check the seller has good reviews
Marisa (Mawisa): like this peep, $25 for the uniform and good seller

Marisa (Mawisa): o that's the exact seller i bought mine from
Georgia (Something Sensible): Are shipping times bad?
Marisa (Mawisa): hmm. really varies. i'd give it at least a month but i've gotten things in under a week.
Marisa (Mawisa): 2-3 weeks is the average maybe
Marisa (Mawisa): i made 14 orders for supplies on February 19th and I've gotten 2 of them so far
Georgia (Something Sensible): _how can they be cheap and not rip you off and have good shipping_
Marisa (Mawisa): china <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Marisa (Mawisa): o another package i'm tracking arrived in south jersey today it'll get here tomorrow. exciting.
Georgia (Something Sensible): what size were you marisa?

Marisa (Mawisa): yeah
Marisa (Mawisa): when is genderbend happening? :0
Georgia (Something Sensible): uhhhhhh good question
Georgia (Something Sensible): i cant say for sure until i find out my internships cries
Georgia (Something Sensible): but id do it for CCE
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): CCE would be safest bet.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~im lowkey tempted to buy the wig and gym uniform and squeeze into zenkai but BAD IDEA~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Squeeze into your schedule where.
Georgia (Something Sensible): my point exactly
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If Jess doesn't do Mina uniform you could borrow hers maybe.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): saves you money.
Jess (whoozica): What going on
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~but also you should figure out how to have a single ponytail with the two tone hair cause that would be more impressive than twintails~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Georgia wants to screw with her lineup.
Marisa (Mawisa): genderbent bnha character group
and adding another cosplay to georgia's zenkai lineup because she doesn't have enough. she's only doing 5 or so right?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Which is already plenty, you crazy person.
Marisa (Mawisa): no there's so much time for so much more i'm doing at least 5 and i'm staffing the entire day
Marisa (Mawisa): D o A l l T h e C o s t u m e s
Georgia (Something Sensible): single ponytail looks bad cause it makes my face look too round
Georgia (Something Sensible): otherwise i wouldve half dyed a white ponytail
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You wear ponytails all the time.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _and that makes my face look round_
Marisa (Mawisa): is that bad :0
Georgia (Something Sensible): ye i dont like it
Georgia (Something Sensible): itd be fixable with learning to contour but EHHH thats a skill i havent picked up
Georgia (Something Sensible): OOP i was about to buy my starfire wig but theres 15% off starting tomorrow at 9 am
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh wait only green and purple wigs

Georgia (Something Sensible): oof now the starfire bodysuit and wig have been bought
Georgia (Something Sensible): thank god i have a pair of shoes to butcher already
Georgia (Something Sensible): now i just gotta get the facepaint, sealant, and fabric
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Genderbend heros for CCE let's set it now LMFAO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~also like does Ali have the XXL uniforms cause I would like to BREATHE~~
Marisa (Mawisa): some sellers should!!
Marisa (Mawisa): omg samurai dan and jill are gonna be at cce

Anna (loud and likely blonde): Like my CC number got stolen last time
Marisa (Mawisa): WHAT
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeah

Anna (loud and likely blonde): I somehow find all the scams instead of real products

Marisa (Mawisa): oh noooo that sucks when was it?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): So like might just do the Amazon one
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Uhhhhhhh like a few years ago
Marisa (Mawisa): :0

Anna (loud and likely blonde): My purple marker ran out before I finished this wig why
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I had like two sections left
