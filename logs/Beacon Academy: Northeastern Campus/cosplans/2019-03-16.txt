Georgia (Something Sensible): Can someone quantify exactly how much of a thot you’re supposed to look like at raves
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): The amount that you wanna be
Georgia (Something Sensible): I literally have only raved maybe twice but I wanna go check it out and hang wth friends
Marisa (Mawisa): i think it grows as the night goes on. like, earlier on not so much because there may be kids present? but 2am yoo
Georgia (Something Sensible): What is the average thotiness of attendees
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause honestly I’m probably gonna pack 100 blue and red clothes ranging from catholic nun to stripper whose rent is due tomorrow
Georgia (Something Sensible): And y’all can just help me out in deciding pre-rave
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You just. Wear what you want.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There are no rules, asides from nudity.
Marisa (Mawisa): why not wear all 100 at the same time and gradually take them off throughout the rave
Georgia (Something Sensible): Maximum chance of heat exhaustion yesss
Georgia (Something Sensible): My question is less with comfort level and more with dress code lol
Marisa (Mawisa): o rave isn't like the formal ball, no dress code. there are ravers which are people who dress up just for the rave, but you can wear just about anything and stroll in however you want
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The dress code is don't be naked.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And you can be *very* flexible with that definition.
Marisa (Mawisa): and no chains and no bags because people try to bring in alcohol
Marisa (Mawisa): leave your bag in the hotel room or check it at bag check
