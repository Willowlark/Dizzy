Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): jk lol
Jess (whoozica): dont get <@!301927856240459777>  s hopes up XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): BEN NYE AND SNAZAROO
Georgia (Something Sensible): Wow those are homestuck words if I ever heard them oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ben nye is oil based, it stays on better through sweat, but if you have oily skin it fucks you, also it costs most
Georgia (Something Sensible): Snazaroo is water based so it‚Äôs easy to sweat off but it‚Äôs less oily, and less expenses
Jess (whoozica): lol imma try snazaroo
Georgia (Something Sensible): _cursed knowledge_
Jess (whoozica): what about mehron?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mehron is also oil based I believe, but it‚Äôs thicc-er then ben nye
Georgia (Something Sensible): So you need to seal it better
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ben nye powder sealant is by far the best no matter what paint you get
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tho baby powder will do a slightly shittier job if you wanna save money live better
Jess (whoozica): ohh shiii ok ü§î  i used ben nye for lilith but this is for my face so maybe ill try the snazaroo before i wreck my face with ben nye
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeeee
Georgia (Something Sensible): My homestuck flashback is strong now
Georgia (Something Sensible): _oh wait BINCH ya doin Mina? Frick my Ochako need intensifies_
Georgia (Something Sensible): Justin and I blasted through like 12 episodes last night

Jess (whoozica): then i gotta make horns so you can help me there too XD
Jess (whoozica): idk which outfit i wanna do yet either üòÖ
Georgia (Something Sensible): Someone responded to my question sticker saying Toru
Georgia (Something Sensible): _bruh how do I become invisible_
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *stop being Wise Rice cosplay*
Jess (whoozica): Loooool
Erik (slendergiant): Someone at CCE was carrying around a mannequin with a girl's UA uniform
Erik (slendergiant): *Toru was his prop*
Jess (whoozica): YEA I saw that
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): BNHA has claimed Jess and Georgia. The hold outs are dwindling in number.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): who's left lol
Jess (whoozica): I wasn't holding out lol I just needed to actually see the show first
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I'm pretty sure everyone in this chat who cosplays has been claimed already
Jess (whoozica): ~~not <@351785752197201920> ~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Tom can cosplay All Might so he and Dave can go legitimate with their butt touching.
Jess (whoozica): Hawt
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): No joke first thing on my new feed.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): pfft
Tom (tomukuncosplay): tiny allmight
Tom (tomukuncosplay): i have alot of considerations but no character really calls out to me yet
Erik (slendergiant): That was my struggle. All the characters are so good
Tom (tomukuncosplay): My considerations would be:
Deku
Kiroshima
Denki
Bakugo
Froppy
Stain?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can see Tom being Todoroki ü§î
Tom (tomukuncosplay): yeah so
Tom (tomukuncosplay): i thought the same thing lmao
Tom (tomukuncosplay): but i just cant lmaooo
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Too many emotionless characters?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): very true~~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): oof
Tom (tomukuncosplay): alright ill add him back on the end but >.>
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): You gotta do someone excitable. For a change of pace.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I mean i ahve 9S
Tom (tomukuncosplay): at least
Tom (tomukuncosplay): although im only halfway through the series
Tom (tomukuncosplay): so I'll see once i catch up
Jess (whoozica): Tom let's watch bnha rn
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Emotions ARE prohibited 9S.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I don‚Äôt think anyone here cosplays Deku yet hmmm...
Georgia (Something Sensible): GUESS KONKON IS BNHA THEN WHOOPEE
Erik (slendergiant): Rebecca does
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~re-uses outfit from last year with different wig~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): OH YEAH
Georgia (Something Sensible): There we go
Georgia (Something Sensible): I was gonna say he‚Äôs the main character that would be odd
Jess (whoozica): Rei does too!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Si! I does Deku and soon Denki~
Georgia (Something Sensible): NICU
Jess (whoozica): Whooo!
Georgia (Something Sensible): Everyone is responding to my story saying Uraraka and Denki
Georgia (Something Sensible): And idk if they‚Äôre saying Denki to be memes or if they legitimately mean it
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause he and Uraraka are my top two right now
Georgia (Something Sensible): Then prob Jirou and Todoroki
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cosplay wise
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol so are we planning to do BNHA for KonKon this year? ü§î
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think as much as we all love RWBY, it‚Äôs taken a little more of a backseat
Georgia (Something Sensible): Possibly cause we‚Äôre waiting for a new volume and BNHAs season 3 just ended I believe
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I wouldn‚Äôt personally object to doing RWBY again?
Georgia (Something Sensible): But BNHA is like the hip cool thing all the rad kids are doin
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): do what you enjoy, not the masses.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Aight I was just wondering so I can get a plan down on what to wear XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~like drugs but better~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk do we wanna put out a vote?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I‚Äôm good with either
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Doesnt matter to me. I'm the same lol. I as thinking of doing Raven but a while back I was kinda thinking BNHA christmas would be super cool and cute too XD
Jess (whoozica): Found my outfit already
Jess (whoozica): Gotta cut those arms off tho
