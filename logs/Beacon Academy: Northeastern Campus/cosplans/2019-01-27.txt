Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just get wire, form it in the shape of a bubble wand. Helps if you use a melted pot of hot glue and dip "wand" in then treat the rest like a normal bubble.  XDD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Do they hold their shape after cooling?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Of fuck I forgot to tell you <@289944569410224129> Chris said you can borrow his Jaune wig!

Anna (Cadmium): Just. Please. I beg one thing. No one sing anything from frozen at me. It has. Bad memories. Of teaching small children when that movie came out and I had hair like Ana's

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm just a perfetionist and my brain starts to go into panic mode when things aren't on point. 

I hate it. Like let me just dress as a cartoon damnit. XD
Anna (Cadmium): MOOD
Anna (Cadmium): grimm yang is NOT what I want her to be
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like my brain is vomiting and choaking itself over details cause reasons and I'm just like S T O P
Anna (Cadmium): Same same sameeee

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm making cookies for the Friday shoot btw
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I'm going to try and make a shit ton so everyone can have some
Anna (Cadmium): Don't add the lining for katsu rn. Maybe summer just had multiple cloaks
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah... but my roomate is saying it's not bad
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm just lazy
Anna (Cadmium): But also FUCKING RT STOP MAKING WHITE CLOTHING WITH A DIFF COLOR LINING
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also RT WHY DID YOU GIVE NEO WHITE HIP HUGGERS
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I can't find good brown hip huggers that fit my fat ass like
Evie (Katheryne Knight): w h y
Anna (Cadmium): Mood like yang how are you fighting in lo rise jeans
Anna (Cadmium): With a cropped jacket
Anna (Cadmium): WHERE CAN I FIT MY CHUB
Anna (Cadmium): Honestly like. I'm using jeggings from now on
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THIS IS A MOOD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): fuck. neo's. outfit
Evie (Katheryne Knight): those damn pants are made of p o l y e s t e r
Evie (Katheryne Knight): When Hunter came up to shoot me, I barely fit in them cause they hella shrank in the wash
Evie (Katheryne Knight): they barely fit me before
Evie (Katheryne Knight): and they make me SQUISH
Jess (whoozica): I have brown jeggings that are from Walmart for like $13 they'd prob work for her! They are super comfy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I've been thinging of getting Jeggings
Jess (whoozica): Like they are tight and form fitting bit stretchy too
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just invested in some. 15 bucks on amazon so it shouldn't kill me.
Jess (whoozica): 👌
Jamie (Jamie): ~~im making intestines~~
Jamie (Jamie): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Heads up: <@!386874959009415170>, <@!334090409389195266> and <@!155492347122155520> imma probs drop from that DarliFa group we in on Thursday 😩 my Ikuno wig is giving me too much trouble to style and i don't wanna cause myself anymore stress...
Anna (Cadmium): Honestly if you're not happy with ANY of it yeah you should probs drop it.
Anna (Cadmium): Not worth the pain
Jamie (Jamie): I just had a thought about how even when i finish dying this rope I have to wait for it to dry to put wire in it damnit *im impatient*
Jamie (Jamie): Also i hate that i have 2 ropes and that one is cotton the other polyester and i need 2 different dye baths done because of it lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I got it looking orrtty decent, just not 100% accurate. If I can get my hair clip in properly it's a go... if not then 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
Will see later. I stepped away from it for now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Mood. I'm seam ripping the zipper out of my old boot cover to use it as a pattern for the new boot covers. I've been at this for an hour because the stretch fabric keeps RIPPING
Anna (Cadmium): Gotta steel my nerves to sew this damn edging on.
Anna (Cadmium): And then find out how to attach this shit to me
Marisa (Mawisa): superglue
Anna (Cadmium): It has to stretch
Anna (Cadmium): I'm gonna. Probs use a buckle. I need more poly weave strap
Marisa (Mawisa): Stretchy superglue
Marisa (Mawisa): tfw you’re on a sewing machine and you thread the bobbin and the needle goes down and magically brings the bobbin thread back up with it 👌 👌 👌 
warms my heart every time it’s like watching ship wreck survivors being rescued and given warm blankets
Anna (Cadmium): This is a weird question but if I bring my sewing needles to a shop what's the chance I'll find ones like it. 
Cause I have no idea what my machine actually needs and it's not in the manual
Marisa (Mawisa): Depends on your needles and how much of an ancient eldritch leftover they are but you might have some pretty good chances as long as they aren’t handmade by the oldest surviving seamstress in the world as she sings a tune while diving 50 feet underwater without scuba gear because tradition dictates that’s how needles should be made
If they’re common needles it might not be too difficult
Marisa (Mawisa): If you take it to a regular chain store they might not help much depending on how seasoned the staff is but a sewing machine store proper would be able to help
Anna (Cadmium): It's a machine from the 90's they look like normal needles. I just can't fucking tell what any of the writing actually means
Anna (Cadmium): I need not sacrifice something to an eldritch God
Marisa (Mawisa): idk if you can’t read the writing that sounds like sewrunes
Marisa (Mawisa): they used that in Ancient Greece where to get sewing machine needles u had to vape rings of strawberry smoke outside the temple of hera on the second Tuesday of November and hope they had needles in stock
Marisa (Mawisa): Kind of like the hidden tower on neopets
Mark (Mad Doctor): I do that all the time at the hardware store. A good service person will be happy to match your needle
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~for a moment honestly thought you meant vaping~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey I did a make up test on Chris. Constructive criticism and tips to improve is SUPER appreciated. Especially if you know how I can contor his face better that would be awesome
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I did fuck up his left eye a bit
Anna (Cadmium): Idk I think it looks pretty spot on
Anna (Cadmium): Maybe contour his cheekbones a little
Anna (Cadmium): Is the facial hair drawn on or real
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's what I was thinking! I need to find a good contour pallet for pasyty people

That's his real hair 

We draw it on for cons
Anna (Cadmium): I use a too faced one but that's expensive. Try wet n wild contour duo things or the elf quads. Use a light hand and more of a cool brown for shadows and if you worry it's too dark blend it out with translucent setting powder so it's less drastic
Marisa (Mawisa): What’s the character? Qrow?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea he be Qrow
Anna (Cadmium): A v convincing qrow
Marisa (Mawisa): Lookin good ya
Agree with the cheekbones but it’s good enough that I could tell who he was without the costume
Marisa (Mawisa): Which is spot on
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thanks guys!! >\\\\<
Marisa (Mawisa): Do dollar stores sell shoe laces
Or drug stores
Or do they not sell them because druggies abuse their power
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Probably?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel like I've seen them at a dollar store or like CVS before lol
Marisa (Mawisa): Ooo I hope so
Marisa (Mawisa): Thank
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good luck~
Anna (Cadmium): *god bless past Anna for buying a big bottle of fabric glue*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Speaking of bottles I'm gonna get buzzed after I work out tonight to see if that helps with my cosplay XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm turning into Qrow help XD 
Not actually
Anna (Cadmium): LMFAO on the other hand I'm cutting out alchohol until katsu bc I wanna see if I'll lose weight. I drink like. A lot. A LOT. And beer has many calories
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Water
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Is good for u
Anna (Cadmium): I run it through beans
Anna (Cadmium): But srs like i can probs save much money not spending it on booze. 
And then I get buzzed at katsu
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Definitely
Then you can celebrate during Katsu!
Marisa (Mawisa): If I see anybody drinking anything but water at katsucon they’re gettin arrested and you’ll know if someone’s been arrested because 1.) they’ll be in JAIL and 2.) they’ll get one of these stickers from me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof
Mark (Mad Doctor): Junior detective?
Marisa (Mawisa): Assuming the Brooklyn 99 group on Friday morning doesn’t go through all of them cleaning up the convention of hardened criminals
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I honestly don't drink at cons but I might this year since Chris is officially of age to drink publicly!
Marisa (Mawisa): Jail
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh if I'm cosplay Neo at ant time you're welcome to arrest me
Anna (Cadmium): I'm 22 I can drink in an establishment that sells alchohol
Marisa (Mawisa): Selling alcohol was banned in 1918 and consumption was made illegal in January of 1920 so you’ll be hard pressed to find anywhere selling alcohol
Marisa (Mawisa): It’s been outlawed for nearly a hundred years now wow
Anna (Cadmium): * drinks industrial alchohol * you can't stop me
Anna (Cadmium): Alsoooooooo wow I hope this works with me gluing this thing
Anna (Cadmium): Cause
Anna (Cadmium): Idk when I bought this
Marisa (Mawisa): I’m telling my mom an she’s gonna tell your mom and then the PTA is gonna gossip about it
Mark (Mad Doctor): I love beer but it's not kind to the diet. Which is why I've been moving to cocktails. And prohibition doesn't count when you're more than four times older than the Scotch you drink
