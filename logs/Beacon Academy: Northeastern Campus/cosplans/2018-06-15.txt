Jess (whoozica): <@229713389511901185>  I get you on the bathing suit front. But we are our own worst critics. Comfort *is* important though. I think winter would look great as a one piece if you are not comfortable with a 2 piece! I'm sure you'd look wonderful in either 🙌
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thanks <@!351471675843411978>  ^___^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also what happened at ANext? How was it a disaster?
you want fucking rwby chibi?: photoshoots not run by georgia or i? bad
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Excuse. I ran Zenkai with Georgia. 😆
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ok ok, photoshoots not run by Anyone Of Our Group = bad
you want fucking rwby chibi?: :}
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tanks!
you want fucking rwby chibi?: 💛
you want fucking rwby chibi?: but the point still stands, the photoshoots we went to were horrendous
you want fucking rwby chibi?: the only one i went to that was good was the one i _took over_
you want fucking rwby chibi?: group photoshoots, at least
you want fucking rwby chibi?: any photo-taking with bill are generally always good
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So was it just messy or did something really bad happen? Was it like a Katsucon incident?
Jess (whoozica): I didn't go to any photoshoots at next 😮
Jess (whoozica): Oh Sept private shoots with bill
you want fucking rwby chibi?: youd have to ask g and bill(?) about the rwby shoot, but the bnha shoot i went to on friday? complete disaster
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What happened at katsu o.o
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The dude running the shoot was 15 minutes late, and we started late. And at Katsu you ONLY get an hour.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There’s a variety of details. Basically next tried to organize shoots, they failed to do so well, so everyone was confused about shoot and locations. Then the people who ended up in charge of the shoots were sloppy, which in its own is fine, everyone needs to start somewhere, but they also were unwilling to accept advice.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh right the shoot I took over.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah that shit was fucked from the start.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We didn’t even get to ships really.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): For Katsu that is
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes.... I assume this is the one by the fountain?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ANexg sounds like a similar story
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We just started so late.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!334090409389195266> yes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It was okay but it started late and the guy wanted us to wait
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not quite at Next. They had no call list, so it was pretty bad. Characters and pairing were missed all over.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh lord
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OH. And they kept fucking trying to direct people. “Nora, raise your hammer higher” THREE fucking Nora’s raise their hammer.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Jesus
Jess (whoozica): I can barely get through the day without a list how people expect to run a shoot without one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Group shoots are NOT private shoots. Take photos, and let people enjoy themselves.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The best photos from group shoots are MEMES.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YES
Jess (whoozica): ~~raise ma hammer right into yo face~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes
Jess (whoozica): Memes 🙌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The directing pissed me off. Delayed the whole shoot so you can get a shittly lit shoot in the back corner of Next.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: - host went on the fb page: "this is my first time rrunning a photoshoot!" "oh im gonna be a little late" "oh nvm i cant come at all, my cohosts will run it!" "nvm i can come again!"
- bad first location for so many people, were told to move by con staff. lost rare cosplayers in the move.
- NO shoot list. no organization. no anything. the hosts would group up for a couple seconds, point at a character and go "[characters name]! that one! go up!". no rhyme or reason. just whoever they saw/remembered existed.
- left out so many characters. didnt call up a solid 44. forgot characters _names._ 
- again, no rhyme or reason, theyd get 5 seconds into a photo and go "oh wait, [x character] go up too and we can do a [y ship/pose/fight scene/etc]!!!" did this several times. at one point they even went "oh nvm then" when they realised a character they tried to call up had left.
- i ended p shit talking the photoshoot not even 5 feet from the hosts. i dont even think they heard me. i had to g and get certain characters photos on my own bc they forgot to call up characters.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: all in all friday bnha shoot was a mess and i took over the saturday one bc the host never even showed up.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yo let me tell you about this one Persona shoot I went too where basically the Akihiko and Shinjiro took over the shoot because they were doing fan service. It was really pissing a lot of people off
you want fucking rwby chibi?: me and 3 other people managed to run the sat shoot coherently,  thank god.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): This is why I don’t run shoots
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~fucking ironic given Georgia asked me for my first private shoot after the Zenkai’2017 album went up at AnimeNext, so I technically got my break by taking a group shoot seriously~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And the rest is history~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): BUT. I didn’t stop the shoot because someone was too far to the damn right.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ngl RWBY shoots need more than an hour and a shit ton of coordination. 
Hell any shoot with a fuck ton of characters need that
you want fucking rwby chibi?: OH the friday bnha runners tried to direct shots too it was bad. there was so much wrong with that shoot ill complain about it for Days
you want fucking rwby chibi?: Oh Yeah Seriously
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Know the crowd, and know your options.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Particularly the logical order for them.
Erik (slendergiant): Katsu was a mess because they were late and then we wasted a fuck ton of time moving everyone to di the stupid AHWU intro that never went into an AHWU...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shit fam unrite
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *u rite
Evie (Katheryne Knight): What is the AHWU?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Georgia’s list is extremely well put together and makes running a shoot easy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): AHWU was STUPID DEAR GOD.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The sunday marvel DC shoot at zenkai was pretty terrible too... but I think mostly just because it was sunday and there wasnt a huge turnout
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also yea qhat even is AHWU
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I was confused 
<@!184437198865563648> ever thought thought of running the Persona shoots? XD
Erik (slendergiant): I started watching AHWU waiting for it and it never happened so now I just watch it for the unboxing shit 😂
Jess (whoozica): Me: *drops by Saturday katsu RWBY shoot* "thank God I'm not a rwby today"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But what is it XD
Erik (slendergiant): Achievement Hunter Weekly Update
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL SAME JESS
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oooooh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Meh I was having fun. I got to be Winter
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s alllll that matters to me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Pics or not I get to be my ice queen
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Trueeeee
Jess (whoozica): Whoo!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!229713389511901185>  Im not fighting Steve Vo for them, and Id rather get a group together personally. I can spend more time with people, get better photos, and socialize more. I started shooting to meet people after all.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like the shoes kill me but I love being her. 

<@!184437198865563648> damn oh well. I just feel like you’d coordinate it better. But heeeeey if ya ever wanna shoot some Purse-owner~ OwO
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): I enjoyed the ANext shoot, but I admit that's a bias. Being Hazel basically means "HOLY SHIT THERE'S ONLY ONE OF YOU!" But, you only got your shots in if you asked for them. I could do with quite a few less of the ship shots, and would much prefer action shots, or semi-faithful recreations from the show. I'm glad they let me have a solo shot with the Nora and Ghira, but that's really all I have to write home about.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: speaking  of g's shoot list i <@!245270932602486784> i gotta know yr order for stuff so i can go about making a good, solid list for bnha
Erik (slendergiant): I was surprised that there were *three* (3) Taiyangs at ANext
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): #three3
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey there was like 6 Winters at Katsu that’s a new one for men
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Saturday that is
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): Wasn't there only one Jaune at Anext?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): W a t
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s slightly upsetting but I’m sure they were happy. XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Was it Hal? XD
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): NooooOOOOooo idea.
Erik (slendergiant): Twasn't Hal
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I shot panther at Next so....
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m still not sure who I’m doing. I think I might do Sae (normal outfit) or Akechi
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Asketchy ey.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ECHkechi
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): There was only one Pyrrha too!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *was the token Pyrrha of Anext Sat*
Georgia (Something Sensible): REBECCA SAVED THE DAY
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😄 ✌

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Would a hotel have a long enough bed for Erik to Boudoir~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~no~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nothing says sexy like legs hanging off the end of the bed.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Erik (slendergiant): gosh what a mood
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I thought the thumbnail was you for a hot second~~
Jess (whoozica): lol i thought it was my friend justin XD
