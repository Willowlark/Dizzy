Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ‘€ <@!334090409389195266> I may or may not be getting a bee kigu...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BEE SQUAD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I did it. I bought stuff for a casual/raver Blake cosplay for Saturday Night of Katsu
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Still gots money for food shopping OwO
Marisa (Mawisa): Thatâ€™s a cool name. What anime is food shopping from?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The Food Anime OwO
Marisa (Mawisa): Ahh yes shokugeki no soma. Or do you mean the food anime about bread or dessert or radishes or the other one about desserts or ramen or candy or the multiple agricultural cooking shows or the one where a guy fights every boss in the world so he can cook and eat them
Marisa (Mawisa): Toriko is weird
Mark (Mad Doctor): So I'm thinking that a yellow or dark purple zentai suit, plus appropriately colored horns, might make the easiest RWBY cosplay ever. Might do it for Zenkaikon
Anna (Cadmium): ~~do it~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Everyone's planning RWBY for zenkai so I am gonna drop soemthing to do RWBY too. It feels weird not having it in my line up too lol~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Bless that RT store discount code that Erik shared with us last night, I was able to get my White Fang flag for Blake~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Don't tempted me to make Human Salem
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Do it~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Just for prosperity, how exactly would one tempt you?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Mark doing the one of the God's
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Doesn't help Chris wants to do Ozma's first incarnation
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Jaunepin?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Nooo the OG Ozma
Matt (mattmyers25): Someone should be one of the gods and dab when you approach them XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): LORD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I dab after I gain the nation's of the world to help me destroy them
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Actually I do need an opinion from friends who are more experienced in the sewing department. What kind of fabric would you recommend I use if I make Human Salem?
Marisa (Mawisa): like a wide ribbed knit? ðŸ¤”
Marisa (Mawisa): comfy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ooo i used that sort of thing for mavis, can confirm, very comfy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Is it easy to dye? Would you recommend a lining? :)
Marisa (Mawisa): Hmm depends on the fabric. Sometimes itâ€™s organic sometimes itâ€™s synthetic and impossible to dye.
Anna (Cadmium): What kind of blend are you getting? 

i only ever successfully dyed synthetics with specific synthetic brush on dyes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@!289944569410224129> I'm attempting to print some of that chainmail
Anna (Cadmium): godspeed
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof some of the links didn't print right so I had to pull them off so that'll probably fuck up somewhere
Anna (Cadmium): or it could print really weird and really cool
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it's the first layer so hopefully it won't cause too much of a problem? but since the links are printing interlocked, it may cause some fusing.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or it'll just fuck up the entire print
