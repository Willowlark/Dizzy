Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am excite!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's looking really good so far by the way!
Jamie (Jamie): I need to find something for support on the inside top. Thinking if i can find Styrofoam/light foam of some sort to hold up stronger and i can give a thicker look to the hair overall
Jamie (Jamie): Thank! I had like too many layers of hair spray coating my hanf to achieve this xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yeaa that's what happen with I did the one I did years ago XD

Jamie (Jamie): Lmao xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wasnt perfect buuuttt tt worked ü§∑

Jamie (Jamie): I wanted to cry that first lace front i get to mess with and I cant keep it pretty and over wear it
Jamie (Jamie): Like i want a lace front i cant wait to get one for heather c. When I finally get to do that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lace fronts are V nice.My first one was the Kylo wig. I like how clean they look and how well they blend in üëå Sadly though they pricey lol
Jamie (Jamie): That they are oof and they never exist even as cheap quality its just 60 or nuthin everytime i search
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My Ikuno one was only like $38 ü§î
Jamie (Jamie): Oh? Where at?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Amazon
Anna (Cadmium): Someone needs to cave and learn how to lacefront wigs. I've heard you can do that.
Marisa (Mawisa): o i've done that before. i cheated and used glue instead of ventilating because ain't no one got time for that. the process is simple tho.
Marisa (Mawisa): it's easier to make fake hairlines than to turn a regular wig into a lacefront
Anna (Cadmium): Dost thou have a youtube tutorial to link for this
Anna (Cadmium): Mm true for our uses it would make sense to just do a fake hairline
Marisa (Mawisa): arda has some neat videos
