Erik (Red Riot Thot): Should I be extra and paint my gears with anodized paint?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What is anodized
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Metallic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh, ok its "durable" metallic coating
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That shine might be too extreme for kiri, but I'm here for it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Extra is always great LmaO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I went with a Rustoleum metallic instead
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ye, that looks less extreme
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Good call
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah the other stuff is meant to go over chrome finishes
Georgia (Something Sensible): The sandpaper flew right off the bit on my dremmel
Georgia (Something Sensible): Soooo does that mean I need a more high quality dremmel?
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's the stuff I used for Iron Man
Evie (Katheryne Knight): How old is your dremmle?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Not old like probably a year
Anna (Cadmium): U might just need a new dremel head
Georgia (Something Sensible): I got a pretty cheap 15 dollar dremmel not gonna lie
Anna (Cadmium): Walmart?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Amazon üòé
Anna (Cadmium): Eh it's worth a try to replace the head
Anna (Cadmium): Ppl good with the fabric things.  Should I sew spandex with a serger
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it helps with stretch but spandex doesnt fray so you could just do a zigzag stitch
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I did my Kiri sleeves with a zigzag stitch and it was fine
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): zigzag- quicker, less thread used

serger- slow, stronger hold, stops fraying
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Pain in the ass but that's more so the fabric
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): If the dremel head flew off that just means it wasn‚Äôt on tight enough. It loosens over time from dremeling a lot
Anna (Cadmium): Bless I just don't wanna screw up and have this tear mid con
Anna (Cadmium): And I have never spandexed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): just make sure you give yourself enough seam allowance and dont sew too close to the edge otherwise you'll be fine
