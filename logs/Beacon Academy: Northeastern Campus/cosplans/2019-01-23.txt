Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!289944569410224129> do you own a Wig Grip from Arda at all? 

That's how my wig stayed on for Pyrrha. ðŸ˜ƒ
Anna (Cadmium): Nope. It's got a ton of clips under it now. I think if I increase the diameter of my head any more it won't actually get on my head now lmao
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I hiiiiighly recommend getting a wig grip. Like my wig did NOT move at all. I could dance with it on and it still wouldn't move.
Anna (Cadmium): Interesting. How does it actually stay on your head tho
Evie (Katheryne Knight): velcro :)
So you put it on like those stretchy headbands
Evie (Katheryne Knight): after you put the wig cap on
Anna (Cadmium): Wait shit I might not be able to the crown is very very fitted to my head with the wig 
Gonna need it for a Weiss wig tho
Anna (Cadmium): I shall invest in one for my next Arda order
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It owuld probably be super hlepful with Weiss's wig since she's got that side pony.
