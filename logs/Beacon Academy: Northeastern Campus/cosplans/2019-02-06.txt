Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I actually really like NYX and I realized CVS has a good bit of that brand so I may go there this weekend and get some stuff for katsu OwO~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Honestly like. CVS has good stuff. 
But Ulta is the next step up Sephora is sometimes too pricy
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *leggo*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I'm gonna head to CVS this weekend and grab new eyeliner and stuff
Jess (whoozica): Can they foundation match you at Ulta? Tom needs a heavy coverage foundation for stubble and shit but I can't foundation match him for the life of me
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Ye
Anna (loud and likely blonde): However. 
Look up some drag tutorials and you'll see they use like. Orange concealer on the 5'o clock shadow
Anna (loud and likely blonde): If it's dark. 
And then you don't need as full coverage a foundation. 

They also have testers out so he can patch test it on his neck or so to see if his skin is ok with it and if his neck is good. 

Otherwise swing by Sephora and ask them to color match and if they can give you samples of it.
Jess (whoozica): Yea we tried derma blend I think? We tested out like 6 shades but no emayched him exctly
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I should get some orange conceler since I'm going to try covering Chris's brows again
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wet n wild smells like paint thinner but works amazingly
Anna (loud and likely blonde): orange concealer basically then set with powder and then do the rest of the face
Jess (whoozica): I'm afraid to use it on him since his sister is allergic. He has nyx right now but it's too dark
Anna (loud and likely blonde): hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Anna (loud and likely blonde): he is sheet o paper pale like me right or what is his undertone
Anna (loud and likely blonde): is he pink, yellow, or olive
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sheet of paper pale XD
Jess (whoozica): I don't know üò≠
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like that description
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lemme stalk some photo
Jess (whoozica): He's not super pale
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i wanna. say hes warm undertone
Anna (loud and likely blonde): after stalking his instagram
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Maybelline fit me matte and poreless is a good foundation
Anna (loud and likely blonde): if you get color matched in one brand. Temptalia has a chart i think that cross compares across brands for the same tone
Anna (loud and likely blonde): https://www.temptalia.com/foundation-matrix/
Jess (whoozica): Oh nice! Yea I wanna say warm too. He tans like instantly in the summer but takes awhile to burn
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk how ppl get actual tones. but if he leans towards yellow and not pink, hes warm
Jess (whoozica): Ooo ok pink is cool?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea
Anna (loud and likely blonde): theres like. cool, warm, neutral, and olive
Anna (loud and likely blonde): idk how any of it really works
Jess (whoozica): Lol me neither üòÇ
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i dead use a mix of 2 fenty foundations depending on the season~~
