Marisa (Mawisa): p o c k e t s
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Fuck this fucking hair
Anna (loud and likely blonde): This bitch only half done
Matt (mattmyers25): Fuck it?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): And I have used a whole pack of wefts
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I can't say fuck it I need to finish this hair to comitt to my gay ships
Anna (loud and likely blonde): But holy hell did I not expect this to be this stressful and messy
Georgia (Something Sensible): thus dubbed "stressy"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *stressy indeed*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): On the bright side I will not need any wig cap for this hair as I strategically made it to fit over my bun
Tom (tomukuncosplay): PRESENTO MIKU
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Gift Michael is in progress indeed
ZombieHunter: Gonna cosplay Ghira but gonna kinkshame <@!289944569410224129> â€˜s other half
ZombieHunter: 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Guys I may have found the answer to all my problems when rooting wigs
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): It's a huge ass marker I can fill with whatever color I want
Matt (mattmyers25): Time to touch up and repaint qrow's sword this weekend
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): <@289944569410224129> I might need to try those cuz I want to root Evelynn's wig. I'll have to check work tomorrow.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Also I put up a bunch of polls the other day on Insta about cosplans. Can I just say I'm utterly shocked more people want to see me cosplay Velvet over Neo?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Velvet doesn't get enough love
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Tis true. I have to bully my buddy into making Coco faster ðŸ˜‚
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Use a coupon if you buy these tho they were $40 rip. You can probs buy just the empty markers for cheap it's probs the inks that make it so bleeding pricy
