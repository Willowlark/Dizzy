Monica (absolutezerocosplay): And it's August 26th
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Did you not tell the people what you’re intending?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I did, but I didn't go into full detail until after they said that they can do it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m not going to lie, I’m very sketch on the idea of trying to turn a horse into a cosplay component.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Hmm okay, would you like me to find someone else to shoot it?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I don't want you to be uncomfortable
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): But I would like you to know that I'm going to be working with the people there to ensure the utmost comfort of the horse
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *would be so much easier if the person I know's horse wasn't a baby 😩 *
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Lol yeah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Alright so. What kind of photos do you think you can get? Asides from solos of you up on the horse, assuming the horse has no issues with your costume spooking it, you can’t interact with the cosplayers swinging around weapons. The most iconic shot to get would be when Ren cuts the final blow. The horse will be too tall standing, I can’t imagine they’ll have the horse sit (iirc horses don’t sit unless injured?) and you especially can’t swing a prop knife at him and expect him to not freak out. If the horse was very familiar with the group and outfits it might be possible, but I can’t imagine he won’t be spooked from the start having never seen cosplayers before. 

I’m not trying to be a buzz kill, it’s a *super* creative idea. But beyond a few basic photos, there’s little to be done that can be done safely. A horse owner might be able to prove me wrong, and I’ll hush in that case. I don’t want you to spend the money to do this without expressing the ways I see this going sideways.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): horses most certainly can sit and lay down. xD
 i'm sure there would be an introductory period with the horse as well, probably before the actual shoot day (or you can ask about it monica) to make sure the horse isnt spooked by the costume.
But, typically if people allow photoshoots their horses are very used to new people and new surroundings. Same thing with trail ride horses. they are desensitized to a LOT.

While i understand your concerns bill. I think it's more something monica will need to talk to the owners about.
Because i don't think they would allow something that would cause anyone to be in danger in the first place.

plus, there have been horse cosplay shoots in the past, hell there have been WOLF photoshoots with scary costumes as well xD
It really just depends on the horse. Plus there's time to figure this all out with the owner and the horse.
Even just getting a few good shots on the horse, even without rnjr would be really cool.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): This is a place that does weddings and other events with their horses so they're used to a lot of people. I don't want too many action shots, if any, and I will be going up there a couple times to meet the horse and take measurements and talk with the people there to get an idea as to what they are fine with us doing. The most that our rnjr friends will do it probably crouch from afar and look like they're ready to attack, I also figured that we could get a few pictures with just the team to capture the feelings of the episode. I don't need it to be pixel for pixel accurate, I just want to do something cool and different.
snow ( crescentbladed ): Horses are really intelligent, plus the owner will know what will and won’t work. It should be fun : D
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup, speaking to the owners is the primary thing here. I’m sure they care a lot for their horse, and we don’t want to blind side them or the horse with anything. For me to go into this with the responsibility as photographer, I’d want concrete plans for the photos to be taken beforehand, which are shared with the owners so they know what we’re doing before hand. Having less RJNR involvement does clean up a portion of my concerns, I jumped the gun on that one. 😃 

I’m not strictly opposed, but I’d like to see how this develops before I take on any main role here.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I will get those concrete plans when I can, but the first step is finding out whether they'll let me do it or not. If you'd like, we can go up there together to talk to them about everything and flesh it all out.
