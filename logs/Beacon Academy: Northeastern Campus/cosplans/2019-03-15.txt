ZombieHunter: I have a 3D printer now and this changes EVERYTHING
Chris Onyx: What printer? OwO
ZombieHunter: Flash forge finder?
ZombieHunter: Small but jimmy sold it to me for 200. Very user friendly.
ZombieHunter: I leveled my build plate and started a print in 15 minutes
ZombieHunter: 😄
ZombieHunter: NOW I CAN PRINT MY OWN DAMN GAMBOL SHROUD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): damnbol shroud
Chris Onyx: Eyyyyy
Marisa (Mawisa): genderbent ochako is just
Anna (loud and likely blonde): terrifyingly accurate
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yo i know CCE is kinda far away but would it be ok if i also do Fem! bakugo for the GB group? I've been swinging around ideas and was considering doing kirishima or deku, but if i'm honest with myself the only one i'd actually want to put effort into is bakugo xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~rebecca, we can do the spiderman point meme😂~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~do it~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): life is too short to care about doubles
Anna (loud and likely blonde): plus then u can take more ship photos if u into that

Anna (loud and likely blonde): imma just dump this here
Jess (whoozica): someone with powa, pin that plz
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *billiam that u*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): In more ways than one.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Opinions, does this need helmet to be recognizable.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Pilot boi?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ye and the question mark concerns me.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): at the very least, get yourself some big wrap around sunglasses
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sunglasses doable but like, the meme is a year old now (I had this for *last* Katsu, but I (correctly) thought it'd be too hard to cosplay and shoot at the Katsu intensity) so if I need the helmet to pull it off.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Pilot boiii~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was able to recognize it without the helmet 👌🏻 but yee agreed with Erik. Sunglasses may help some.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’ll do, but am I just better off with a helmet? I originally intended to skip it so I wouldn’t have to keep track of it on top of camera gear, but I’m lazy shooting Zenkai and running the shoot so recognition is good... I can get one, amazon prime, but will it stand without?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): it will but if you wander away from the rwbys it might not. 
Good news is most helmets have a strap u can hook on something so you dont have to carry it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m mostly worried about rwbyies.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Since I’ll be in front of them yelling out a call list.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He’s way too minor to expect more than that.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): have a weiss stand near u itll hold water
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you might get mistaken as staff if u just wear the headset tho 💀
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No Weiss this time around. Georgia is Yang.
Marisa (Mawisa): find another weiss
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just don’t wanna be the guy whose got a tail strapped to his butt and is like “I’m a background Faunus”
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u will succeed we believe in u pilot boi
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Do I succeed in spending 50 bucks on a helmet or not is the question*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~whats the return period~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *returning things via mail is a pain in the ass, I buy I keep*
Marisa (Mawisa): could you get this and coat it in white fabric paint?
Marisa (Mawisa): https://www.amazon.com/Aviator-Helmet-Goggles-Set-Adult/dp/B00APP0U5A
Marisa (Mawisa): or

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): wrrrrong type of helmet.
Marisa (Mawisa): o
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd say you'd be fine without. Don't stress about it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Best way to not stress is have the option!*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yolo.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What's 50 bucks.
Marisa (Mawisa): 200 gumballs
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): those gumballs better have crack in em or something, fuck.
Marisa (Mawisa): NO THAT'S ILLEGAL
Jess (whoozica): but but thats 25 cents a piece
Jess (whoozica): a totally normal price for gumballs
Marisa (Mawisa): if you do some searching maybe you'll find one of those machines that lights up and makes fun noises
Marisa (Mawisa): can you even fit 200 in one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 50 bucks?
Marisa (Mawisa): 4 gumballs per dollar, 50 x 4 = 200. i think.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you can definitely fit 200 in one of those
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 100 gumballs isnt that much in reality
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was thinking about doing pilot boi a while back. Have you looked at water polo helmets?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): actually. 
hey bill whats the dimensions of ur head. 
*cracks knuckles* wanna bet i can make u a foam one in one night
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh shit math. I’m dumb.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bought a bike helmet already.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): bad
Anna (loud and likely blonde): BAAAAAAD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I don’t enjoy crafting, if I’m cosplaying it’s by throwing money at things~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~give me the circumference u impulse buying fuck i already own the foam~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): crafting is my crack
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i get high off prop potential
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that might just be the contact cement though
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Especially if I can remove the flip up piece? It’ll look pretty damn in line with the show.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I forgot the pic oops.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh a *bike* helmet
Anna (loud and likely blonde): not a bike helmet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YEEEE the amazon search was confusing for the same reason.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok so uhhhhh wrap a screwdriver in cloth and shove it between helmet and the pivot point of the flip up thingie it should pop off
Anna (loud and likely blonde): from personal experience of almost fucking up my own helmet.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah I think that I can manage. Trick is to do it without ruining the rest.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ye thats why u use the cloth so it doesnt scrape the shit out of it. otherwise peel back the lining (might be velcro'd in) and theres probs tabs you can push to help open it up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm wondering if the mount point under the flip piece will be ugly.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oh, that looks good
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ye. And should fit according to their measurements, which is the other concern when you've *just got so much intelligence it doesn't fit in most helmets*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~going with that~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): if it looks ugly cut a circle of foam or something and stick it on
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YOU ASSUME I have foam.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If I can't do it with my pocket knife I cannot craft it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And even that sounds like I know what I'm doing.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok then carve a piece of a laundry detergent container up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If I can't cut shit with a knife in dangerous fashion, that's the it.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok then just cover it with tape lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Now if there's anything I can't throw money at amazon for I could be sure to hit you up if so required~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i am ALWAYS down to craft for a friend hit me up fam
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~can i give advice? sure. Can i tell u how i did it? nope.~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you misunderstand, I'd throw money at you instead~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i aint a stripper, Bill.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i always wanted to have an opportunity to say that
Anna (loud and likely blonde): thank you
Anna (loud and likely blonde): in reality pls throw money at TNT and i will make the thing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Now no one suggested that. Unless you consider stripping foam core Stripping.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea im into peel porn
Anna (loud and likely blonde): my paint plate needs a good strip too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Hot stuff*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, I've felt weird about asking anyone for cosplay/craft stuff. Hypothetically, since there's only been one time where Jess made a wig for Mirio with spit and dreams. 

I'd like, rather see friends work on their own projects? Which I support? So it's a catch 22.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): let us help support u bc u support us with photatoes all the time.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~plus its not like I can turn off  the crafting. it happens~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I bought a Rin Tohsaka cosplay today guess who I'm doing at Zenkai
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): tank but I know how crunchy things get for frens and if they lost time because of some ask from me I'd be sad.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~especially if they blew up in a katsu crunch fulled breakdown~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im used to making my stuff and half of mags if that makes u feel better so i dont ration and usually i finish a few days ahead of time. if its a basic foam build im like. can do in a day
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'll bring it up if it come sup. 👌
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Bruh I will be happy to style a wig for you if you ever need one. Or attempt to make stuff ~~only cause I've never made things for other people before~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Just need you to convert BNE to persona 3 and RE cosplays*
Erik (Red Riot Thot):
