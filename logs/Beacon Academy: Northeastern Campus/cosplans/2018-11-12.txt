Georgia (Something Sensible): the city is mad expense
Georgia (Something Sensible): so you gotta pay for train or parking on top of ticket, and possibly hotel
Halim (Greg): Parking is gonna be expense
Plus tolls are crazy if you dont have EZ pass
Halim (Greg): ~~I meam theyrr still crazy with EZ Pass~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee I figure this isn't gonna be too cheap of a one day trip cause gotta calculate in gas money, ferry, food, shit might buy...D:
Halim (Greg): ~~but it's slightly cheaper and you can ignore it ~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This week and last week I have had to be really tight with my budget so not broke at the con lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah its train ticket or gas+parking that hits you, then the general expense of city food, possible metro, con ticket, annnnd yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Meanwhile I spent well over $200 just this weekend... 😑
Georgia (Something Sensible): its no geekdom con where you can shave off most expenses
Georgia (Something Sensible): e r i k
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats ok tho you have a smart boi STEM job lmao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I spent $30 this weekend cause my phone charge was being shit/broke and needed other things and immediately flipped out I was spending so much more than wanted to this week already LMFAO
Like my goal is: Spend nothing at all. 
And then my phone charge decided lol nope
Georgia (Something Sensible): i bought... new eyelash glue, more red eyeliner for my pyrrha eyebrows, and a rocket science themed bathbomb
Georgia (Something Sensible): which are all purchases i can justify lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): so i also probably spent about 25
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I needed charger, hand wipes and shit to make my eyebrows purple for next Sat XDD
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ~~cookie sale cookie sale cookie sale--~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): All things I needed so I can justify it. Just still mad I had to spend extra monies on phone charger D:
Erik (Red Riot Thot): A decent amount was for good causes tho. When I bought a bunch of books at B&N yesterday they had a thing up front where you could buy a children's book to donate so I did and then I bought stuff and donated to Extra Life sooooo
Georgia (Something Sensible): extra life is valid
Georgia (Something Sensible): so whens our BNE 24 hour stream 😂

Erik (Red Riot Thot): I bought the second set of enamel pins they put out and then I donated while watching Jeremy stream Spyro
Erik (Red Riot Thot): CAN WE PLEASE?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yea I forgot: I also treated myself to some RWBY/RT merch cause Evie bought stuff from me :X WOOPS  but that didn't affect my budget for this week so still goooooodd~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMFAO YO BNE YT CHANNEL LETS DO IT XD
Halim (Greg): ~~I spent over 100 dollars on jeans today~~

Erik (Red Riot Thot): Big booty energy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What's your size?
Halim (Greg): 32W 32L
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof that's something I need to do. Is buy jeans... I only have 2 now cause my one pair got thin in the crotch from my apparent *thicc* ass thighs T_T
Halim (Greg): I've added 2 inches to my waist line in the last year and its resulted in me buy new Jean's
Halim (Greg): But even those got ass tears in them so I needed more today
Georgia (Something Sensible): i still need to replace my jeans that had the pocket ripped off them
Georgia (Something Sensible): the chalkholder on the chalkboard snagged on a pocket and BOOM RIP

Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah they were old jeans tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): so it ok
Georgia (Something Sensible): they died a good death
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I started gettong ass holes at the pockets of my one pair of jeans. But they're small so I just sewed them up lol
Halim (Greg): Yeah no my ass murdered my jeans may they rest in PEACE
Halim (Greg): I had a lowkey funeral for them
Halim (Greg): And the 1 flannel that also died
Halim (Greg): 4 Jean's, 1 flannel. It was a sad day yesterdsy
Georgia (Something Sensible): howd a flannel die?
Halim (Greg): It's a really old flannel that was killed when I let somebody borrow it for a show
Halim (Greg): They slipped got caught on something and tore out the back like crazy
