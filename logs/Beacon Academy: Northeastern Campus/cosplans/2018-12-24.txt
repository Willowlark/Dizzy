Which one would be best for Persephone?? I was thinking the dark pink.
Georgia (Something Sensible): dark pink
Georgia (Something Sensible): i use paradise mehron and its really reliable
Georgia (Something Sensible): plus powder sealant will lighten it ever so slightly
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhm! I have it in black to use when I wear my automail hand and I really like it. (Also borrowed it from you and it was V nice!)
And oh I didn't think of that but that's good. I was planning to use powder sealant too cause don't like the spray stuff XD Does powder keep it from rubbing off and such well enough?
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i always trust powder more than the spray stuff
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~homestuck taught me as much~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): though the BEST method, in my experience, is the powder sealant, and then a quick spritz of hairspray on the outside
Georgia (Something Sensible): ive stayed golden all day with that pro strat
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~ I'm glad we have so many homestucks I am learn body paint things from here xD~~
And oh really?? Even in the face? It doesn't get sticky? 😯
Georgia (Something Sensible): _even da face_
Georgia (Something Sensible): _even in spray_
Georgia (Something Sensible): ben nye final seal powder
Georgia (Something Sensible): that saved my life in homestuck
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Interesting 😯 lol and noted! Thank. 👌🏻
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i was sweating buckets at 1 homestuck photoshoot outside in 90 degree weather with a HOODIE
Georgia (Something Sensible): and with terezi came up to me and dabbed me with her final seal
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~and i went "im gay"~~ and then the make up didnt budge
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof D: and bless cosplayers helping  each other out 💕
Georgia (Something Sensible): ye so i would hinge a lot of bets on that final seal
Georgia (Something Sensible): i still have a bit left in my tub of it
Georgia (Something Sensible): its lasted me my whole homestuck phase and then some
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'll make sure to add it to my cart <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Georgia (Something Sensible): also as payment for this body paint knowledge
Georgia (Something Sensible): we better get some hella cute hera and persephone pics
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hell yessss!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Damn that's some long lasting body sealing juice
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Body sealing juice xDD
Georgia (Something Sensible): if its powder, then is it really juice
Georgia (Something Sensible): or is it like... cocaine
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Body cocaine 👌🏻
Tom (tomukuncosplay): It's like flour that you put on the table before you roll the dough 🤔 🤔
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): "What's you seal your paint with?"
"Oh just some body cocaine"
😂
Tom (tomukuncosplay): https://i.imgur.com/rnNm1YG.gifv
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Everything can be juice if you will it to be. Even solids.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Jotting notes down for future reference
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): My suit for darling came in today
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I ordered like less than two weeks ago
Matt (mattmyers25): Very nice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 👌🏻
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Did you do custom sizing?
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Ya
I'm lowkey worried
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Its concerningly fast
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I'll try it on later
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah that's crazy fast
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): where did you get it from
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Zentaizone? Same place as erik
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Actually 2 weeks id how long mine took lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ordered Nov 29, received Dec 13
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I said less than 2 weeks lol 
I guess if yours took 2 weeks that's sensible
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Maybe orders were slowing down since Christmas was getting closer?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok so my spidersuit should be coming next week sometime...hopefully
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Big 👌🏻
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I know the shape looks funky, I gotta work on it some more later lol~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Cosplay tip:
If any of you guys ever need to use gliter for anything and dont want to deal with fall out, Mod podge "glass" gloss is revolutionary. It still shows the glitter shine through without dulling it, but also puts a coating over the top so that no glitter falls off at all.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~save yourself from craft herpes~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I wonder if that would work on metallic spray paint too~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ it will
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i've used it for that before as well
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the only thing is that it tends to crack if whatever its on bends a lot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because the metallic silver I used on my new spaulder wipes off and leaves silver residue everywhere and I tried giving it a glossy clear coat and it ruined the metallic finish and just looked glossy gray
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh no, it won't take away the metallic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i used it on my yang boots the first time i made them and the gold shined through
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i had to reapply paint from scuffing them and havent put another coat of mod podge over them since.. but thats because every single time i wear those boots they get majorly scuffed up so it's not worth the extra step
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but for a spaulder that never touches the ground it'll be good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'll have to do some tests
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My spaulder has been sitting on my dad's workbench, untouched for weeks lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I still have so much to do for Tai... and Kiri... and Goro... fuck me~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i would also recommend clear car enamel
Erik (Red Riot Thot): As an alternative to the mod podge?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mhm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its more durable
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Noted
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I used that for my predator spaulder, i mean the paint i used under it was "brushed metal" so not like extremely metallic but still it shows through, and the enamel didnt fade it
