Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yess!!! 🙌
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It’s a beautiful abomination 😍
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Needs more SFF.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Shitty Fucking Flannel
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh wait.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You ARE wearing it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): welp.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't know how this can be more of disaster.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was watching a movie and they showed hot pink fur lined crocs and just... Erik you need fur lined crocs now for Kiri I think XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is everyone kinda basing their christmas outfits off of their hero suit designs or...?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Georgia was reusing Weiss iirc.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I mean, scrooge definitely isnt anywhere close to bakugous hero outfit xD but I thought it was funny
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmmm okay lol. I like the lights and christmas tree idea I have going I just feel I need more detail to it XD feel its a bit boring. I thought maybe painting ornaments on the onesie along with the tree leaf look. And I'm going to add a star to my head soo
Jamie (Jamie): Due to budget my mina went from full on reindeer style to ugly Christmas sweater so i mean xD
Jamie (Jamie): Its great though since the sweater i have is a high as fuck llama
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao ya'll... were all gonna be such fashion disaster XD
Matt (mattmyers25): I'll be santa hughes
Jamie (Jamie): 
Jamie (Jamie): Its basically denki
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Matt if you wanna be a macademia nut with us I am sure I could find you a chara to be >.> hehe~~
Matt (mattmyers25): No
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol my pink alien friend wearing my sweater?? XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): Guys, she-ra and catra, as Yang and blake <@!170686358535274497> <@!334090409389195266>
Halim (Greg) (jake): FUCK
Halim (Greg) (jake): THATS GOOD SHIT
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): What is easier to put on as lettering ? Felt or should I do a glitter glue ? Cause I'm doing a Christmas sweater for toga
Georgia (Something Sensible): felt would probably show up more clear on photos
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Both will take a while to dry (glue more so) but if you want it to look fairly clean I'd go with felt. You can also do iron letters if you want to save even more time lol
you want fucking rwby chibi?: 👀
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also if you did use glitter glue at all anywhere else, I'd opted for glitter fabric paint instead. It'll show up better, plus won't be an issue if wash it
you want fucking rwby chibi?: <@!245270932602486784> https://jinxed-gamer.tumblr.com/post/180509881957/blake-jaune-is-stealing-your-tuna-again-where
Marisa (Weeb): miccostumes black friday stuff has shipped OwO
Marisa (Weeb): is it true that fabric has gotten a lot more expensive? because of government tariffs and whatnot or such
I've considered buying fabric here before I go back because good quality stuff can be obtained for relatively cheap but I know I'll be short on luggage space and idk if it'd be worth mailing stuff back. are fabric prices horribly atrocious now?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee my miccostumes stuff has shipped  as well~! I can't wait to e my rwby girls again and bnha bois~ ~~I went back yesterday and got the boys winter uniform since I need it for katsu sooo XD~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And as for fabric prices hmmm I'm not sure. I haven't been to a fabric store in a few months XD. I know <@!386874959009415170> went fabric shopping the other day, maybe he knows and can tell ya if he thinks they were higher in price??
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't know what topical fabric prices are so I am of no help
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just remeber the velvet I got was like $10/foot
Jess (whoozica): ~~i think you mean yard?~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~maybe?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): velvet is EXPENSIVE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like 26-30 a yard
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *We don't buy and trade Faunus here*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yup
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No it was $30/yard but I reduced the fraction
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I only bought 2 feet
Jess (whoozica): oooo ye velvet spence
Erik (Red Riot Thot): V soft tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ya'll are talking about the fabric and my mind is still racing from Bill's little joke and all I can think of is bougie Velvet in like high name brand clothes XDD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~speaking of which, i really need to use the yards of velvet i bought like 4 years ago 😰 ~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So you mean, Coco taking Velvet shopping.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👌 Yes
Marisa (Weeb): wait yeah was this velvet per yard or per foot because if per yard that's super cheap
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Lol now I wanna do this goofy cosplay fuck XD someone be Coco~~
Marisa (Weeb): ooo in feet
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): <@!386874959009415170> you should have said something about the fabric! The red velvet I bought was 9$ a yard
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It was kind of a spur of the moment decision
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Smh boi
Marisa (Weeb): if I can get stuff for katarina for less than $8 a yard that'll be nice. $10 is do-able. anything more.... hhhhhh......
i could buy the stuff here for less but then shipping
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Chris’s P5 Protag outfit shipped Y E E T

If Kamina were there and yoko's in a suit
Halim (Greg) (jake): How much do you wanna bet his extra as would where a very revealing dress
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Can we NOT talk about how kamina isnt there because that is something I’m STILL not over
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Spoilllllersssss
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Nah, he'd just be shirtless with a very extravagant bow tie
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That mans is worse then sun is with clothes I wouldn’t be surprised if he showed up in his pants and a tie 😂
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): SAME THOUGHT
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oh yeah he'd def be shirtless lezzbehonest
Matt (mattmyers25): My hiro formal outfit is done
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ayyyy!!!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Are you doing his horns or pope hat?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): YASSS!!
Matt (mattmyers25): Pope hat. It is going to look the what was worn at the beginning
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That’s what I figured, I’m just a sucker for klaxasaur hiro
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Matt if you decide you wanna do the horns lemme know >.> ~~
Matt (mattmyers25): The uniform is bought as well. Though, why can't anyone ever out pockets in a cosplay?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😛 my uniform has pockets~ Hehe. And it's a dress <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Matt (mattmyers25): And why? <@169297844874903552>
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): NOW YA KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE A GIRL
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WE NEVER HAVE POCKETS
Matt (mattmyers25): Tbh, you guys do I have make shift 1
Rebecca (madameterralupus): When I discovered my Ichigo uniform has pockets in the dress I was like OMG it's a fucking miracle XDD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I mean, there’s always your prison pocket
Matt (mattmyers25): Also, I may do the horns. I'm on the fence because of unemployment
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~wiggles eyebrows, ya sis here can help ya make them~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MEG I LITERALLY JUST SAID PRISON POCKET OUT LOUD TO SOMEONE HERE AT WORK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i looked back

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): at the same time
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wow
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): GLAD WERE ON THE SAME PAGE 🤣😂
Matt (mattmyers25): Tbh, I was thinking about the bra pocket and the the prison one lol
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Remember the good old days when you could fit your phone in your bra? Those were simplistic times
Matt (mattmyers25): We maybe going back to those times. Samsung is working on making a flippqble smartphone
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They already exist in asia.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m intrigued but I’m an Apple hoe and I don’t like Samsung software
Halim (Greg) (jake): Idk about you I can still fit my phone in my bra
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I fit my phone in the boob area of my Red Riding Hood dress. Fit quite nicely
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I hate both of you
Halim (Greg) (jake): <:gay_heart:378261402089160705>
Matt (mattmyers25): Now now be nice to meg
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Although I CAN fit a bowl and grinder in my bra so that’s an accomplishment I’m proud of
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): omg
Matt (mattmyers25): Oh my
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It’s all about placement 👌🏻
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~nips that could cut diamonds~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Theoretically I could put my phone in my bra
Georgia (Something Sensible): But I don’t wanna torture my bra like that
Georgia (Something Sensible): _it already suffers holding the weight of the world_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO big mood
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~also crying bc nier~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel like I am the only girl in our generation who never put their phone in their bra XD
I did it once in high school to see and was like ew this is annoying, never again XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): 😏
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Crying Because neir or because of Neir boobies?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's a reference.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nier is about the booty, not the bobbies.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I used to when flip jones we’re a thing. But since I’ve had a smart phone I’ve always just put my phone in the waste band of my pants
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay I used to do that all the time too and it worked for a while until it fell down into my fucking pant legs XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Legging my friend
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Leggings
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 you right XD probs better and tighter than sweats which is what I wore when did it lmao
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh I have leggings with POCKETS
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s the true pinnacle of human advancement
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): THATS TOO MUCH POWER
Georgia (Something Sensible): Gym leggings 👌👌👌👌

Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://giphy.com/gifs/zIwIWQx12YNEI
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like right now I have my Galaxy leggings on and they got hella pockets
Georgia (Something Sensible): I can put TWO of my phones in there
Jess (whoozica): if i put it in my bra at all i put it in between them and hold it that that little cross piece inbetween the 2 cups
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m currently wearing legging with fake pockets
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😮 leggings with pockets?? ~~need~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): And they were only 12 DOLLA, 10/10 would recommend
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~they’re also from hot topic~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): damn, 12 dolla... what deal 😮
Halim (Greg) (jake): Ya know what has great pockets? 
Jeans
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): false hal
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): NOT WOMENS JEANS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not womens jeans
Georgia (Something Sensible): Jeans don’t expand when I decide to eat half the dining hall
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Hal you should know this
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You own women’s jeans
Jess (whoozica): yea and i cant wear them to work either XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): You can wear leggings to work?
Halim (Greg) (jake): I do own women's Jean's
Halim (Greg) (jake): It's really sad
Jess (whoozica): legggings i can get away with somehow
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That sounds backwards but I’d just role with it
Jess (whoozica): my boss is so old i think he doesnt understand the concept
Halim (Greg) (jake): My butt looks great but ar what cost
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): POCKETS ARE THE COST
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the cost of pockets apparently
Matt (mattmyers25): Hal is there something you aren't telling us
Matt (mattmyers25): Also, I know a few women that like men's stuff. Because  its comfy and for pockets
Halim (Greg) (jake): I'm a bisexual man with a great ass
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): <@!334090409389195266> were on like the same wavelength today it’s wild
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): stop sharing my brain, we arent oscar, meg
Halim (Greg) (jake): I thought it was commander knowledge that I wear women's clothes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mens stuff rocks~ Honestly I shop that section more than womens XDD
Halim (Greg) (jake): People need to direct me put of the womens section of clothing
Georgia (Something Sensible): I bought a men’s flannel at target yesterday
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I don’t wear men’s clothing but I do shop in the little boys department so idk if that’s any better 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): Fuck the boyfriend flannel i got MY OWN
Georgia (Something Sensible): Well men’s clothing doesn’t work for everything
Halim (Greg) (jake): Half my flannels are womens flannels
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like “men’s” shirts are plain as fuck but have you seEN THE BOYS SECTION AT KOHLS
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): RIGHT
Georgia (Something Sensible): _a treasure trove of graphic tees_
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): THATS WHERE I FIND THE BEST MARVEL TSHIRTS
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao  mens graphic tee's are pretty aight! If you go to the right place that is lol.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): AND THEY ONLY 5$ AT WALMART
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like Target, JCP and Kohls got some dope mens graphic tees~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Well Walmart I try to avoid cause they shady but targét tho
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@!245270932602486784> this may be a weird question, but they fit your bobbies? xD i never shopped the boys area because i thought they wouldnt fit
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): They’re made bigger so they fit
Jess (whoozica): "young mens" at kohls is lit
Georgia (Something Sensible): XL my friend
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also shoulders translate to boobs
Georgia (Something Sensible): The room that men’s clothes have for shoulders fits hobbies
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ok sign me up, im going boys clothes shopping~~
Jess (whoozica): tom doesnt fit in a typical mens small so young mens/boys is where its at
Matt (mattmyers25): Don't go to 
Walmart after midnight
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): BUT ITS SO MUCH FUN
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats when the weirdos come out
Rebecca (madameterralupus): See I think I could fit into a boys XL cause people my size do... but like they feel really small when I try them on D: ~~I didnt think I was that big lmao~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its super interesting
Matt (mattmyers25): You haven't to a ghetto  Walmart
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): My Walmart is pretty empty after midnight tbh
Halim (Greg) (jake): Is there such thing as a not ghetto walmart
Jess (whoozica): boys L-XL fit me pretty well
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I was there after midnight almost every night the week leading up to katsu last year. It was a time
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): those fancy green walmarts
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Also on the topic of mens clothes does anyone else agree that mens boxer briefs are hella comfy??~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): The Walmart’s of Texas aren’t ghetto I just feel like there’s gonna be a duel in the parking lot
Halim (Greg) (jake): See that's still ghetto
Georgia (Something Sensible): Men’s boxer briefs are pretty lit, I’ve used some as period panties not gonna lie
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~I’ve never worn boxer briefs because I’m a slut for booty shorts~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): For when ya just wanna BLEED COMFORTABLY
Jess (whoozica): i almost bought a women's shirt for 125 and found the same one in boys for 15
Georgia (Something Sensible): wow thats tank
Halim (Greg) (jake): It's just white ghetto
Georgia (Something Sensible): Are you saying McCree Overwatch is white ghetto
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I may or may not use them all the time cause damn they comfy. Woops~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause that’s the vibe I get from Texas walmarts
Georgia (Something Sensible): Leanna why
Georgia (Something Sensible): IS ASHE ALSO
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~redneck is white ghetto~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have named all the Walmarts in my local area... is that bad XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): *look* at him
Georgia (Something Sensible): Redneck and cowboy are very different
Georgia (Something Sensible): My father? More cowboy than redneck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cowboy is like.. high end redneck
Rebecca (madameterralupus): As a person who has both "cowboy" and "redneck" relatives... yes they are very different XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like gucci redneck
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ehhhhhhh they’re like love and hate. Theyre is a fine line decorating them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Gucci Redneck... OMG
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cowboy is like domesticated redneck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): refined redneck
Matt (mattmyers25): I'll get the banjos
Georgia (Something Sensible): Rednecks will always yeehaw, cowboys know there is a time and a place for them
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Cowboy is classy, redneck is boxed wine
Jess (whoozica): def a difference
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i like your revision, meg xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): toilet wine XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): The difference was important 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cowboys - take care of themselves/appearance, and belongings. 
Rednecks - Are basically raccoons...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): raccoons are better than that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Dont hate me for that XD I have family members that fit both sooo XDD~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how dare you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): YOU RIGHT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LEAVE ROCKET OUT OF THIS
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Aight so what is a god comparision hmmm?? XDD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mistakes.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): rednecks are the crushed dunkin donut cups that you see in walmart parking lots
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BILL
Rebecca (madameterralupus): VALID
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IMSDGfds
Rebecca (madameterralupus): and omgbill XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM ScREAM LAUGHiGN
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I mean.... thinking of the rednecks I know... he isnt wrong lmao~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i honestly can't stop laughing, hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooly crap
Jess (whoozica): rednecks own trucks that they rig together with duck tape and clothes hangers and a prayer, cowboys have nice truck that they take care of properly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and a prayer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So... Georgia is a cowboy.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I AM
Georgia (Something Sensible): I have thE BOOTS TOO
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): So toga came today and guys!
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): It has pockets!!!!
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Functioning pockets !
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): 
Matt (mattmyers25): Looks good
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cute!
Jess (whoozica): BLESS
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Thank you guys!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Are we still talking about Cowboys cause u m p h
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *cause umph* <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Jess (whoozica): See? No one says that about rednecks
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah cause Rednecks are...eeeeeeeeeeehhhhh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cowboys are 👌👌👌👌
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like Nisha from borderlands? SHE CAN STEP ON ME

McCree? U M P H
Halim (Greg) (jake): Another big difference: 
Being a cowboy was a respectable profession. 
Being a redneck is a disrespectful ass
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^^^^^^^
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That’s the best distinction yet
Rebecca (madameterralupus): No one says umph about rednecks... other than other rednecks XD
Jess (whoozica): ~~scooter? From borderlands? Not so much~~
Halim (Greg) (jake): By definition A cowboy earns a living and can be a daddy by definition. Plus they usually are good at tying things up, have riding crops and a whole plethora of other expertise 
A redneck has none of these things by definition
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Cowboys, you say?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’ve got snake but it’s not in my boot 😏
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *The rootinest tootinest* 😏
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): So toga bangs are done
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cute!!
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Did soft buns for a test
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also damn I just ordered Weiss from Miccostumes on Friday... and it arrived today 😮 that was really fast
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I put the tails upside down so they can wrap better so when I get to cons or wherever I can just do the buns each time
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Damn!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Bunzzzz
