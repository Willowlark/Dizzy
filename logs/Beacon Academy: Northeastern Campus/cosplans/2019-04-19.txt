Anna (blonde and sad): Although every con I've gone to there's always 50 yangs, slightly less Blake's, maybe 10 Ruby's and then like 3 weiss' which made it odd to find out how few ppl I know that do ruby?
Anna (blonde and sad): We just need to acquire friends that already do ruby problem solved
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): kidnap wish from NC
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think the proportion has changed over time. I remember a greater percentage of Weiss and Ruby a few years ago. May change again

I know a local store that sells all sorts of industrial parts but not any chain store off hand, I can ask my mother when she gets done work and she’ll know better than I do
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): The one bobbin is a sad mood
Anna (blonde and sad): no i think they're metal ones. ill ask my mom what the machine model is hang on
Anna (blonde and sad): i went up the hill im not at the studio house
yes two houses one property confusion abounds
Anna (blonde and sad): we are willing for road trip for parts
Anna (blonde and sad): love supporting local stores
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Usually metal and plastic bobbins are interchangeable unless it’s a weirdly specific machine with exact specifications wherein one minor slip breaks the whole thing rip
Anna (blonde and sad): *fear*
Anna (blonde and sad): our lord and sewing machine savior marisa has spoken
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): I am but a lowly peasant with common knowledge I shall ask the true master upon her return
