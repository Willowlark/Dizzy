*remembers fear of cosplay commitment*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^S AME
Emerling: dont call me out like this billium
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Only problem with the glitter for dinner site is that they have super small Asian sizes so be careful careful if you want to buy one
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Giving credit where credit is do my boi.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There go my dreams of being a rwby cheer girl, aw fooey.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa that's the issue I've noticed. Is they are small asian sizes and half the time not even my damn thigh fits into stuff from asian sites XD .... RIO
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): For the cheer outfits though they seem to run pretty large which also benefits me cause I'm not Asian skinny lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Who the hell is other than them though?! XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): People who need to eat more.
Jamie (Jamie): Frick it, pleated skirts are my specialty at this point I'll make the outfit myself and cheaper haha
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): You'll also be able to choose your own words lol
snow ( crescentbladed ): ‘Dead’
Jamie (Jamie): Yea that too so i can do summet and do "dead mom" per the usual
snow ( crescentbladed ): LOL
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh boy XD
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 😂
snow ( crescentbladed ): I kinda wanna do summer and have hers just be ‘withered rose’
snow ( crescentbladed ): only dreams now
Jamie (Jamie): Oh dead 🔚or 🔜dead mom?
Jamie (Jamie): Oooh thats good too i like how its more subtle haha

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay do I look like Monika to you? XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I still need to play that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But it does reduce the plans.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I need to cosplay Monika 
But finding time to is a different story
you want fucking rwby chibi?: oh worm
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh also I kinda need an opinion. Should I get green contacts for Pyrrha? I have naturally greenish eyes hat would work, but idk I kinda want that deep emerald green she has but I also have green contacts I used for my Sakura Haruno cosplay and I don’t feel like buying more.
Georgia (Something Sensible): what the sakura contacts look like
snow ( crescentbladed ): _I made my first circle skirt ayy_
