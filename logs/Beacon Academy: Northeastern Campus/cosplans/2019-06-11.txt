Rebecca (madameterralupus): I saw that too and got excited however gonna price compare to others before buying any from them. Prices are hella marked up like yikes... but apparently you can use a coupon on them and if order is over $50 shipping if free ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Still gonna compared though even with that in mind lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): cosplaysupplies.com is already free shipping
Erik (Red Riot Thot): learned that because I bought from Yaya Han because her list price is cheaper, but hers doesn't include free shipping
Erik (Red Riot Thot): so unless you can use like a 40%+ coupon on it at Michaels, not worth
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa pretty much...
Anna [Cyborg]: Dickblick sells it! Same price as usual suppliers apparently
Anna [Cyborg]: Plus it's couponable and dickblick usually does the bulk discount
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Waaaaaaaa
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): There was one of those where I used to live

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Took one of my normie friends to anext on Sunday and immediately upon entering he said he wanted to cosplay. 

And by the end of the day he had a list of at least 4 cosplays he wants to do. 

Conventions are a powerful force and should not be reckoned with.

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The genuine excitement is wholesome

Anna [Cyborg]: Hey so if anyone is in a thrift store and sees mens pants or a large skirt in that olivey brownish fabric that's used for military uniforms PLS lmk I will venmo u on the spot I just don't wanna spend $60 on fabric to match to this coat
Anna [Cyborg]: I have made a small error
Anna [Cyborg]: And uh. Turns out USMC fabric is about $30/yd
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Have you looked on re-enactor sites? You might be able to find something there. Although unsure how much you want to spend...
Matt (mattmyers25): Military surplus stores are a great place to look at well
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ That too
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just knock down a Marine and take their clothes. It'll be fun.
