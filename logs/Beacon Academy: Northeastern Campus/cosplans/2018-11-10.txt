Marisa (Weeb): are there any online shops in north america that sell cosboard
Marisa (Weeb): also 11/11 is both pocky day and a huge sale day in china so you can find good deals on aliexpress
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think I recall reading that cosboard goes by a different brand name in the states
Jess (whoozica): ~~whats cosboard?~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): This stuff. A little like worbla, a little like foam, I think.  Not easy to find here or cheap. I read about it when I first started looking into making props. https://m.facebook.com/AnimePopMall/posts/1373535832754438:0

Erik (Red Riot Thot): Remaking Tai's vambrace. Do I put worbla under it to keep its shape?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You're making it out of leather yea? I don't know if the Worbla will stick well to it..
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'd be adhering it with contact cement after shaping it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ah okay. I'd say give it a shot? XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): You can wet mold it too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But if the leather is too thin you might be better off just contact cementing to worbla
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Worbla doesn’t adhere well to contact cement <@!386874959009415170>
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): In my experience hot glue works best with worbla
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Noted
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Was that trying with the shiny side or the rough side?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I haven’t had good results with either side with contact cement
