Rebecca (madameterralupus): New trens: wear your cosplay wigs with the tag still attached!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Taiyang: I was wearing the tags before it was cool.
Yang: Daaaaaaad, stop trying to be hip.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yea speaking of wigs, my new Sun wig came today apparently! Might do a quick test tomorrow? 🤗
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Salem wig came in the other day 🙌  it's only the fourth time I'm doing this....
Erik (slendergiant): ^ that's a mood (as I'm constantly adjusting Taiyang wig 4.0)
Erik (slendergiant): *although Salem is significantly more work...*
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): oh its work alright XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🍌🍌🍌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So much happier with this wig! 🤗
Now to finish The gauntlets... and try to do a prop within a little over a month lol
Jess (whoozica): KYOOOTT you can does it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): AYYYYYYYYY you look so cute
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thanks!! 🤗💕
Jess (whoozica): does anyone know how to get volume in bangs on a wig? like so the poof up a lil?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): tease them and heat style the roots upward
Jess (whoozica): do you put any product in it?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): got2b glue hairspray usually will help
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but it gives that shiny crunchy effect so what ive been doing lately is using water based tacky glue because it dries clear and matte and it washes out with water
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and it holds better than hairspray. so basically i take a TINY bit on my finger and rub my fingers together and use it like a hair gel
Jess (whoozica): yea! i was trying the got2b but it made it look greasy XD made ill try the glue then! i might have some allready so tat would be coo
Jess (whoozica): thankies!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no prob!
