Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@184437198865563648> <@245270932602486784> <@351471675843411978> <@351785752197201920> SO I think I found a place that would work for a location Nier shoot....and also various other cosplays. Its called the art factory in Paterson nj. It's a warehouse setting studio. 

Pretty sure wed have to pay to go. But it might be something we could look into as a group. Similar to the chestnut hill shoot!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bless you.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Absolutely worth looking into.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~hears the word warehouse setting and immediately goes to look it up cause I've been looking for a place like this to shoot some of my costumes lol~~ 🙏
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cost may be worth it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): If you guys want examples of photos shot there, someone I went to school with takes a lot of her photos there. @thecommercialkid on insta. 
Itll give you a good idea of what kind of photos we can get
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I believe it's similar to a movie set. I think they have a bunch of different backdrops
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I looked it up on google and it looks pretty nice 😮 It looks fancy but also still very warehouse-y which is awesome
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.instagram.com/p/BpIF5pTA5tJ/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=v96n5yzn0145
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That could pretty well. I wonder if there’s a big open room with piping above it. That’s my vision.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ya'll go there and do Neir for photos... I tag along and do FMA 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.instagram.com/p/BjAyVdoH76B/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=elig6i203ryu
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeaaaah that’s pretty close.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Theres also a room with industrial looking pillars
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But the floor is wood so it kinda throws off the vibe
Marisa (Weeb): photoshop floor into nothingness
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This will be looked into.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEET
Rebecca (madameterralupus): > Buys ticker for anyc 
> Me: Welp now to figure out da fuq imma wear to it 🤔  And I have no clue what would be best suited lmfao
Jess (whoozica): 😮😮😮😮
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is an excellent idea of what to wear at anyc!! Thanks <@!301927856240459777> 😝
Marisa (Weeb): I’m here to help

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Pj kiri?
Erik (slendergiant): Definitely
Erik (slendergiant): Y'all, my Little Red Riot Hood costume came in... it actually *"fits"*
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <:lenny:456549338026344489> "fits" eh?
Erik (slendergiant): Meaning, *"I can close it in the back"*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > me ,writing down information about the sunflower we shoot we planned:
> Erik: Taiyang
> Leanna: Penny--
> Leanna: *Yang*.
> Rebecca: Weiss
> *What am I even*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Weiss? 🤔
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can't even.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pretty brain dead today, but I'm trying to do *something* productive.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Organizing my shoot idea board seemed like a palatable idea.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO WEISS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): At least Penny made sense, I was just flipping through social media and saw your costest...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Weiss I have *no idea*.
Erik (slendergiant): *FOR THE MEMES*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Art Factory is 100 dollars per person <@!334090409389195266> <@!245270932602486784> <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> . That's also implies the stage you want can be reserved away from you. To reserve a specific stage it's 1,000, but that's not per person. They seem to expect if you drop 1,000 it's a group of 10 or more, hence flat rate.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://myfactorystores.com/product-category/film-photo/
Jess (whoozica): Big. Oof.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You do get to make use of the whole facility for the whole day though.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Unless someone reserves a stage exclusively.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The website is shitty for info.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Website is *utter* crap.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not that I'm writing it off quite yet.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's a cool space.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm going to talk to my old boss about it. He had connections and might be able to help us get a discount
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Leanna playing the *game* like a boss.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'll call probably monday and suss out actual details.
Jess (whoozica): Yea see about that cuz $100 is alot for a few hours for me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, considering it's a full day recent and they have like, 12 sets...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Consider it a day trip. I bet costume changes will be doable.
Jess (whoozica): ~~100 is alot for a day trip for me too~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~same here~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But we'll see what we can do.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): None of us (except danger master Leanna) have a collection of rundown buildings we can break into for the aesthetic.
Jess (whoozica): Not the kinda that fir warehouse at least
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That reminds me, what was the name of that place you went that was fallout like <@!334090409389195266> ?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm updating my ideas and plans board.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Letchworth village
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): There was one room that was kinda warehouse aesthetic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Lemme find a video
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Nvm video wont send so heres some screenshots lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Theres also a "garage" next to this area that has BIGA WAREHOUSE VIBES but it's really dark in there because of lack of windows. So that would be hard to shoot unless we brought lighting
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's the MOOD tho.
