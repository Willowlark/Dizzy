Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I got more elastic for arm ribbons and I'm assuming this was returned at one point because it was priced down for a dollar and is just wrapped in paper with a price tag slapped on it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So yeet, saving dollars
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Time to hot glue things to my arms
Matt (mattmyers25): Sounds painful
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> Eriiikkkk
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's low temp, I'll be fine
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Don't hurt burn yourself <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also are you wrapping the elastic around your arm and then gluing velcro to attach it? Or what're you doing to make the arm wraps? üòÆ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Curious cause I need to figure something better out for mine
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I made two bands, one to go around my forearm and one on my wrist. Then gonna wrap more spiraling and crisscrossing both ways and gluing where they cross
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And then I'll go the other way
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh. So you gluing it all as one piece and just slip it on as that? üòÆ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ye
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh oki üòÆ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's basically how I did the other one for mu first Blake but that one I used velcro and it kept peeling
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was thinking of using elastic too but was just gonna wrap and tuck it, probs wouldn't stay though. My current one is thick material so doesn't stay well or look god XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's the bane of every Blake cosplayer's existence
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That and her damned symbol on everything XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh yeah. I always trace the symbol but cutting out a stencil is always a pain
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh noicu! :o
And yea after doing my boots I've kept that stencil for bigger versions and then have a tiny one for gambol shroud xD still annoying to put on things lol

Anna (loud and likely blonde): This isn't even crunch I just don't wanna pack
Anna (loud and likely blonde): YES SO CLOSE
Anna (loud and likely blonde): U CAN DO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wouldn't have to glue them though if the damn liquid stitch had worked... >.>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I üáß üçÉ
Anna (loud and likely blonde): U should try the iron on fuse stuff instead of liquid stitch in the future
Anna (loud and likely blonde): It's like. Tape. U put between n iron
