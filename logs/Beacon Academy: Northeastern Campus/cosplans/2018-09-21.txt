Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>  I got Arda points to use and they are having a sale this weekend so imma order my Denki wig~ Wooo!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!169297844874903552> hey before you do that, I know a wig seller that had a Denki wig with his little style already!!!!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): https://www.kasouwig.com/my-hero-academia-kaminari-denki-short-layered-golden-wig_p1287.html
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Youâ€™d need to style it a little but these wigs are top quality
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Iâ€™ve never bought a wig I didnâ€™t like from them
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I think itâ€™s also available in the LA Warehouse too
Erik (slendergiant): Wow that looks great and for that price??? Holy shit
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep
And I promise itâ€™s good quality
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Itâ€™s where I got my Neo wig and Chrisâ€™s Torchwick. It might need styled but the fibers are kinda already working in your favor
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I also got my Levy McGarden wig there too
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I highly recommend Kasou for character specific wigs
Erik (slendergiant): Ok so my shitty Amazon wig for Kiri is supposed to come today and if that doesn't work out I'm buying this: https://www.kasouwig.com/my-hero-academia-kirishima-eijiro-short-red-spiky-cosplay-wig-ka042_p1249.html
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP! Only thing you might need to do is style t, but as I said, the fibers kinda already work in your favor
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So it wonâ€™t come spiked but it will be EASY to spike it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like my Neo wig only needed minor styling
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): dude i fucking wish kasou had a neo wig when i did neo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yours looks incredible
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh thank you!! I'll have to check that out ðŸ¤—
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!334090409389195266> ITS NOT TOO LATE

<@!169297844874903552> I definitely would! Youâ€™d save your Arda points for something you might later!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): owo ....does anyone have red converse i can borrow? >.>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): No ðŸ˜¦ Iâ€™m sorry >_<
Jess (whoozica): no ðŸ˜¦ if you're up in the sussex county area though woodstock vibes in frankford? i think it is sells them for like 10-20 a pair

Jess (whoozica): YAS they have alot of good stuff
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So now that I am on my computer I can look at that wig you linked me better <@!229713389511901185> . It is deff a better style (won't have to cut it much) and color than the one I am planning to get from Arda (since one I want is out of stock). Only thing that makes me sad is they said it doesn't come with the lightning stripe ðŸ˜¦ But I was gonna have to add that in anyways lol.
Erik (slendergiant): *"We cut a black cardboard into lightning shape and **sticked it** on the hair with **UHU** glue, it's very easy to do :D"*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Can I use *UwU* glue instead?! Sorry had to. I know I am lame XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Went with the Kasaou wig for Denki. Colored and not having to hopefully do much styling intrigued me. My order for Arda was gonna be about the same soo XDD Why not try out a new company~ (I did order black weft from Arda though for the lightning bolt)
