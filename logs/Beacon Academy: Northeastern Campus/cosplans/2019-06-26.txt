Rebecca (madameterralupus): So those of you who use alcohol markers for wigs... whats the best brand to use, how many do you normally use... Just any advice would be grateful. I am trying to add some brown roots and streaks to my Adam wig but the marker doesnt seem to be doing much unless at main roots...
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Get darker color than what you are going for. The Michael's alcohol marker singles  work for me.
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): I used like 20 for my yang wig
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): In like 6 different shades of yellows and oranges
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I feel I need to get black.. cause I got our darkest brown and its not doing much D:
And oof... thats a lot of markers and money. Fuuuuccckk lol
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Well yang is also an atrocity of a giant wig
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): You'll prob need like 5
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Maybbeeee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol valid. Ya think black would look okay for Adam? O.o I know it technically brown but i dont think we have a darker brown than the one I got now
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea black might be your beat bet. Ummm also is the marker your using dry by any chance??
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Try dunking it in rubbing alcohol
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): And you can also use a paintbrush and rubbing alcohol to drag the colors down the hair from the roots
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Nope cause it marked my hand up lol. And hmm okay I will give that a shot tomorrow. Might help cause getting it into the long streaks is where it's like uhhh. 
Thank you for the helpful advice!! ðŸ˜ƒ
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Ye I hope it helps!
Anna [Cyborg]: You can also just use an alchohol based ink and a paintbrush and just buy a big copic refill or one from liquitex
Godspeed Rebecca
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh okay! If the method Leanna gave me doesnt work tomorrow I'll see about getting the supplies for that Thurs and try that :)
Thank you!!
Anna [Cyborg]: You're just rooting a wig right? 
You could also use sharpie bc it won't be the whole wig
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Im mainly doing the roots but would like to get a few of the weft streaks colored too. Since his brown spread through out his hair in places
Anna [Cyborg]: Yeah worst case you can use sharpie
Anna [Cyborg]: Good luck friend
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm I shall see what I can  do lol. Thanks for the advice guys! ðŸ˜ƒ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Otakon is in a month and I'm really praying my Makoto Niijima cosplay gets here in time
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Black would probably work <@169297844874903552> . I colored in bits of my Scarlet wig with black Sharpie and it helped it blend with the dark brown undercut parts
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh okay! Ill try to remember to get black then tomorrow at work. Thanks!!
Anna [Cyborg]: i fucked up and my boots for rtx are supposed to arrive july 3rd
Anna [Cyborg]: lets hope i can somehow make covers for them in like 1 day
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Uh oh... I assume thats when the con is/super close to it?
Anna [Cyborg]: yeaaaaaa my flight is uh. the 4th....
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof
Anna [Cyborg]: i fucked up
Anna [Cyborg]: i have a backup plan but i wanted to use these specific shoes 
anna why
Anna [Cyborg]: at least it left the UK
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have Adam scene kid hair ðŸ˜‚ ~~I feel it's fitting~~
Anna [Cyborg]: its definitely fitting
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I cut the other side too thinking it'd look okay.. it does... fuck. But I can style it to fix it~~
