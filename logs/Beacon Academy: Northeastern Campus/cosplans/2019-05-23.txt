Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: U stannin real hard man
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: But also. Lmk if I should buy that hard copy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Gonna be honest, the printing of it is very low quality and the content is probably under your skill level. I mostly got it to support her and got the physical copy because I prefer it to a PDF
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but the print job looks like it was just printed off a home printer
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Aw that's sad I hope she didn't send it to a printer and get that in return
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I'll probs buy the PDF version to support her but also I kinda skipped intro level skills in cosplay and went straight to complex stuff so I'd still probs learn stuff
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Wait is it like. An Amazon book? Like an amazon print? Or is she listed as the distributor
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Go to her website to buy the ebook version
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://zonbisworkshop.com/shop
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Simplicity patterns go on sale tomorrow  (till most likely Sunday)  at Joanne's, says Ivy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
