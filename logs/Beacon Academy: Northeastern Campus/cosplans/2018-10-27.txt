meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): HELP
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I pulled a bulbasaur Halloween costume out of my ass in two hours tonight for a Halloween party tomorrow. Do I wear my hair in space buns (the emulate his ears, keep my hair off my neck while dancing and drunk etc) or wear my hair wavy like I do for poison ivy????
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think the space buns would look super cute!
Casey (Raining_Jellyfish): buns!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also yes, keeping hair up and off neck when dancing/drunk ðŸ‘Œ
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Honestly thatâ€™s the biggest thing. I like my hair better down but I donâ€™t want to have to deal with it in a hot club
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. Well maybe you could start off with it down but then tie it up into buns as you get more active?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yeahh that wonâ€™t happen. It takes like 30 Bobby pins to get my hair into buns and thatâ€™s not something Iâ€™ll be able to do properly once intoxicated
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof. That's a hell of a lot of bobby pins XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I got ALOT of hair ðŸ˜‚
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): oof that sounds like a painn
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Itâ€™s not bad once itâ€™s up, and it only takes about 20min to do
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel that. When my hair was long it was a hell of a lot to deal with cause it's so thick XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I was a gymnast for 15 years so Iâ€™m used to having a lot of Bobbi pins in my hair. They donâ€™t really bother me anymore
Marisa (Weeb): "this costume isn't wrinkled at all except for the spots that are super wrinkled"
my brain's flawless reasoning to try and avoid ironing 6 hours before i have to wake up for an event because my friend wants to go insanely early
