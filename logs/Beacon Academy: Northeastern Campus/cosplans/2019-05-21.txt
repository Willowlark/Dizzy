Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh uh I still have to sew the sleeves on, hand sew the lining into it because it's too slippery to do the 3 layers on my machine
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And I need to add the bottom white stripe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And then top stitch
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof hand sewing
