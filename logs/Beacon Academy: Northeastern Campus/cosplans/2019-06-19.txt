Anna [Cyborg]: I anticipate we wouldn't be able to shoot this till like. At least september anyways unless y'all planned it for a con y'all are attending
Jamie (Jamie): The curse of that white Cape, it gets stained more than dirt along edge and it kinda dies oof
Anna [Cyborg]: Damn. if we got more summer backstory i'd say it might be worth doing the cape in like. something we could spray with the hydrophobic spray
Jamie (Jamie): i mean potentially still good idea i mean waterproofing cape would be a genuine idea anyway to protect it and would be functional
