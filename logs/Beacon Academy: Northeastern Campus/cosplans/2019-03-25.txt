Georgia (Something Sensible): OOP THERE YOU GO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u think i could do it by hand???
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i am prepared for the suffering
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but i just dont know if its a good idea to do thin bits like that
Marisa (Mawisa): Appliqu√© it?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): either cut it out by hand in iron on vinyl
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OR
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lmao....here this is gonna be worse but it'll look phenomenal
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): use puff paint to draw the design on.....then embroider over it

Anna (loud and likely blonde): but like its not embroidered in the model soooo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it'll look fucking great
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but idk

Anna (loud and likely blonde): the bird boi in crit role? or am i butchering that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh no Corvo from Dishonored

Bird boy from CR I believe was Vax
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I think...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *oof we gonna buy all the bias tape arent we*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also I think Chris might learn how to sew
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I told him Corvo might not be great for beginners but I also told him to go for it because honestly taking on something above your skill level helps you learn so much more
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's what I did for Nora
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): sometimes you gotta just go ham and learn a whole new skill set
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what the fuck, go for it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm gonna be ordering worbla soon to start Ozmas armor, If you buy more than one sheet the prices goes down per piece. 
So, if anyone wants to order with me let me know!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh I may hit ya up on that lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea let me know! i'll prob place the order some time with week, so i'm just gauging interest before i do it!
Georgia (Something Sensible): HOW MUCH YA GETTIN I just murdered my last sheet on Pyrrha‚Äôs sword
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'm getting a large sheet (possibly jumbo depending on interest)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not sure which one to get yet, but i'll basically go with any of these 3
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): black is better for smooth finish, pearly is more like thibra, and finest is the regular yellow one
Georgia (Something Sensible): I usually do finest, black is a little softer which is nice for molding but idk I like my worbla as hard as possible
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i bet you do
Georgia (Something Sensible): I usually get a jumbo sheet but I could get a large if that‚Äôs what da group wants
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I usually get black cause I'm lazy and don't wanna have to fight to smooth it much with wood glue xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye i usually do jumbo too, but i figured that might be overkill
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): up to ya'll tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm not picky though so can do whatever lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea black has been my saving grace with smoothness
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but its a pain in the ass to stick to itself sometimes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): if it makes u feel better?????? the person who won second place in the cosplay contest learned how to use a sewing machine for her costumes. She pulled two master level kimono/hakama/all that stuff out immediatley after learning to use a sewing machine
