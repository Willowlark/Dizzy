Georgia (Something Sensible): THERE IS A TRICK YES
Georgia (Something Sensible): so heres what worked for me this time around
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats the inside of the thigh piece
Georgia (Something Sensible): that white inside the front, thats velcro, and that attaches to velcro thats sewn into my socks in the corresponding part
Georgia (Something Sensible): that holds it up FOR THE MOST PART
Georgia (Something Sensible): so i added in that black band of elastic into the middle
Georgia (Something Sensible): and that acts as, essentially, a makeshift "garter" to keep it tight on my thigh
Georgia (Something Sensible): i took down party decorations for a solid 20 mins and the thigh pieces didnt budge
Evie (Katheryne Knight): youll have to send me that shit cause boi i'm not going to know what th hell i[m doing when I mae my own XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): i had to make them the first time over to really learn what i was doing lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah me and Chris have a battle plan tho.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Since we‚Äôll probably be redoing his Jaune armor to be more sturdy at the same time XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Fiendishly clever. Thanks! I was thinking something with magnets, but this looks like it will work much better
Georgia (Something Sensible): the trick is fighting gravity at the end of the day lmao
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Basically XD
Erik (slendergiant): LOOK WHAT CAME TODAY
