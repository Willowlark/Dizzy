Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its its own site
Jess (whoozica): avasdemon.com
Marisa (Weeb): that's what i thought
it been many years, i thought it'd be cool if i could bookmark it with the rest of my webtoons
Marisa (Weeb): hey amazon i have a question
why
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO a secret cosplay?? 
Also yeaa the exact wig I need for Peresephone was being discountinued too~ and it was just enough to hit over the mark to get a free factory wig~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: avas demon is so good ive been reading for years
you want fucking rwby chibi?: f yr looking for webcomic reccomendations i have a ton that i read or am planning to read
Marisa (Weeb): yes pls
mainly on webtoons because they have a super easy bookmarking system
but i also read stuff on other sites. it just gets a bit tedious because i have to remember to check each one
Marisa (Weeb): these are the featured comics i'm following on webtoons, plus also aerial magic and phantom paradise that are cut out of the frame and on hiatus
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i read a lot of things that have their own websites aha;; but theyre still good tho
Marisa (Weeb): ~~homestuck~~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: hhhhhhhhhhh
Marisa (Weeb): do you follow any of kosmic's comics??
you want fucking rwby chibi?: l isten. i finished that one.
Marisa (Weeb): nasty red dogs / feast for a king
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i dont think so? at least it doesnt ring a bell o:
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i should add them to my list tho >o>
Marisa (Weeb): they are uh VERY nsfw at points
so be cautious
but the story is good. feast for a king is nearly as confusing as homestuck at this point
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ooooo
you want fucking rwby chibi?: im chill wrt nsfw so üëå
you want fucking rwby chibi?: uhhh some of my favs rn are: monster pop!, paranatural, and long exposure, and one of my alters is begging me to read monsterkind !

Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): just felt... generic? Airhead girl, guy who has crush on her, oh no big secret that could affect their will they or wont they...
