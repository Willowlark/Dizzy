Georgia (Something Sensible): Are ya workin on DA BOOT?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Nah, shirt
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh hella looks like I‚Äôm working for a while now
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I‚Äôm making a new Pyrrha neckpiece that doesn‚Äôt actually try to murder me
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): about time.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeaaaah my neckpiece is from my first draft of Pyrrha
Georgia (Something Sensible): And not only is it annoying as fuck, but it‚Äôs more inaccurate
Georgia (Something Sensible): It‚Äôs shorter then Pyrrha‚Äôs actual neckpiece goes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Not to mention that commission I did gave me a new pattern for building Pyrrha‚Äôs neckpiece to be comfier
Matt (mattmyers25): The commissioner that is making my qrow sword, is making ruby's weapon and that folds. Pics of that to come when its finished
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh my it seems I have accidentally been productive
Georgia (Something Sensible): Neckpiece is drying now then I just gotta weather and glue the gem
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I finished trim around bottom of the shirt! Just have to do the collar bits now
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Going to also try to finish boot tomorrow since my mom is kicking me out of the garage so she can put her car there if it snows this weekend
Marisa (Mawisa): does anyone know what craft stores sell reasonably priced resin molds
I bought a bunch but they were eaten by the house and are currently MIA

similarly, if I mold half a circle and then stick it on top of another half a circle while it's drying, they'll dry together into one piece right?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I actually have no experience with resin oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): YA GURL CAN BREATHE NOW THO
Georgia (Something Sensible): Left is old, right is new
Marisa (Mawisa): e x p a n d n e c k
Marisa (Mawisa): my resin experience is limited to gems that get stuck on other things, but this time i need bigger 3d pieces that stand alone
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Whatcha making? üòÆ
Marisa (Mawisa): me? :0
earrings and a hairpiece and a brooch
i'm also missing grommets for my shoes and fasteners for my multiple cravats
Marisa (Mawisa): i ordered them and they arrived at the house while i was in japan but they were separated from the other stuff
Marisa (Mawisa): and then the house consumed them
Anna (Cadmium): <@301927856240459777> in theory it should work otherwise epoxy the halves together
Marisa (Mawisa): oooh yeah i didn't think of that!
epoxy sandwich
Anna (Cadmium): Not tasty but effective
Marisa (Mawisa): cronch
Anna (Cadmium): I am peeling flexbond off my hands but
Anna (Cadmium): All my Athyrra crown needs is paint and the chain n gems glued on
Anna (Cadmium): I gave up on magnets and just made it a solid piece
Anna (Cadmium): I'll just glue it to my forehead
Anna (Cadmium): It's fine
Marisa (Mawisa): it's fine
Anna (Cadmium): I've reached the stage in cosplay where everything is glued to me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): elastic?
Marisa (Mawisa): get that liquid latex
Anna (Cadmium): Nah the way it has to sit on my head has no room. I could. Maybe put some pins in and hope it stays on my wig but the wig is getting gelled on me
Anna (Cadmium): I have spirit gum
Anna (Cadmium): Whoevers in the same hotel room as me pls don't judge me gluing bark on my legs on Saturday I beg u
Anna (Cadmium): I am a hoarder of adhesives
Marisa (Mawisa): i'll only judge if you're in the hallway peeling bark off the decorative hall plants while you glue it to your leg
Anna (Cadmium): Oh no I come with my own bark
Anna (Cadmium): Its ethically sourced from my backyard in the dead of winter
Anna (Cadmium): The actual deer antler on my belt was also ethically sourced
Marisa (Mawisa): *you karate chopped a deer*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *How deer you!*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üò© I just remembered I need to remake a piece of Raven's gauntlets cause I lost a piece at chestnut hill.. fuuuu
Marisa (Mawisa): did it fall off?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think I laid it down inside and we all left and I forgot to put it back in my bag.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have the gauntlets in 2 pieces , arm piece and top of hand covers. I lost one of the hand covers :\
Marisa (Mawisa): i dont need this for a car oops
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What are you buyingm
Marisa (Mawisa): Plastidip
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Lmao
Mark (Mad Doctor): They make a variety of colors. I buy mine at the auto parts store up the street, and it's in the touch-up paint section
Anna (Cadmium): howwwww is it cheaper at auto stores 
its got a 4x markup here i swear. Home depot and lowes has it for like $5 a can or less and its nearly $20 at an auto shop\
Marisa (Mawisa): $5 on amazon owo
Marisa (Mawisa): But it‚Äôs an add on
Anna (Cadmium): rip. 
u gettin plastidip or flexidip
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's $7 at my auto shop, $6 at Walmart. I can walk to the former, and I'll pay a buck to not have to go to Walmart
Anna (Cadmium): wow. 
im jelly. its $9 for autozone and almost $12 at napa
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Walmart has it cheaper
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And more colors than Home Depot
Anna (Cadmium): $6 for walmart and i think i got it for $5 at home depot..... ~~dont tell my dad i use his contractor acct for points~~
Anna (Cadmium): spandex sewers, help. 
Advice for cutting a big hole into something
Georgia (Something Sensible): Define hole
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like are you putting another fabric in said hole
Georgia (Something Sensible): Or do you need there to just be a gap in the spandex
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I'm just imagining a sewer system made of spandex.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *I'll show myself out*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i read this as "spandex skewers"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and was like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "i mean... ig uess you could call a needle a that"
Marisa (Mawisa): i'm a sewer i live under the streets with 4 turtles and a rat
Anna (Cadmium): like
Anna (Cadmium): the grimm yang hole
Anna (Cadmium): ma whole tummy gotta be out
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~in feburary`~
Anna (Cadmium): but its getting sewn to the corset at the same time
Anna (Cadmium): ~~im at work i do drainage systems leave me aloneeeee~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Can‚Äôt thou provide a visual
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like fanart
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): are you gonna do a mesh panel?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): or just tummy OUT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): "Tummy out" - New phrase instead of dicks out lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "this is more of a tummy out look"
Anna (Cadmium): tummy out bc my luck with mesh is ba
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MOOD, mesh is sewing satan
Anna (Cadmium): ill probably redo this shit at a later date if i really love her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): though it might lose its shape if you dont have the mesh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): gotta be EXTRA careful about where you cut the  corset
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but id say personally from where you are with it currently to draw out the part you want to cut out with chalk or something
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): then sew around that, like topstiching
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THEN cut it out with seam allowance
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and fold the seam allowance inward
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): then sew around it again
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THEN add the red
Anna (Cadmium): oki
Anna (Cadmium): i was gonna honestly. glue on the red on the underside
Anna (Cadmium): because i sTILL DONT HAVE MY MACHINE
Anna (Cadmium): im literally gonna have to hand sew it. but its ok honestly the thing is so tight on me it should hold shape
Anna (Cadmium): if not ill just redo the fuckin corset by allstar or rtx
Anna (Cadmium): or ill make it a bodysuit bc like this is excessive
Jess (whoozica): *looks at grimm yang*
all i can see is a bathing suit
Jess (whoozica): like a one peice with a built in bra
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you might need to cut our a smaller hole than the art, just cause if you cut out that big of a hole the corst will lose its ability to keep its shape
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): unless you add boning around the hole
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if you dont have your machine thats kinda hard to do
Anna (Cadmium): yeah honestly i shouldve just sewn it myself but like was running out of time
Anna (Cadmium): and yea its gonna be smaller its like. 6" wide at most bc i want to keep like. skin in
Anna (Cadmium): i just wanna sew my own damn body suit but this is not my skill level rn
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, good, then i think it SHOULD theoretically be fine
Georgia (Something Sensible): see through mesh might do you some good
Anna (Cadmium): to be honest i would rip it tryna put it on
Anna (Cadmium): the rest of the costume isnt exactly not sharp....
Georgia (Something Sensible): the problem would be getting the hole to stay.... hole-y
Georgia (Something Sensible): so youd need maybe duck canvas to reinforce it
Anna (Cadmium): eh itll. get there. 
Oh wait i do have duck somewhere
Georgia (Something Sensible): <@!351471675843411978> prob has experience with her heart shape on noras spandex shirt
Anna (Cadmium): WAIT SHIT I HAVE RED DUCK
Anna (Cadmium): somewhere i think.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): She‚Äôs currently dreaming of CCE, check back later.
Jess (whoozica): ha haha ~~i use card stock to help it hold shape~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): card stock, duck canvas, all is fair in love and cosplay
Anna (Cadmium): im just gonna. hot glue
Anna (Cadmium): lets talk about how half my pyro costume came from a literal recycle bin
Jess (whoozica): with the bathing suit is just sewed around the shape, and uses fray stop
Jess (whoozica): in my experience bathing suits hold up really well to cut outs XD
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i wonder if i can worbla around it~~
Anna (Cadmium): fack i gotta mail that out
Anna (Cadmium): fem ironwood has been added to my con schedule ~~someone tell me why i hate myself~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): iron tiddy

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~her name should definitely be Jackie Irontitty, it just makes *sense* <:lenny:456549338026344489> ~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~also do it~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~if Jackie Irontitty is named after her robotic tits, does that confirm James Ironwood has got a robotic dong?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~iron**wood**~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Ironwood: "Here's your new arm Yang."
Ironwood: "I added a personal feature I'm quite fond of in my... robot appendages."
Ironwood: "Or rather."
Ironwood: "*Glynda* is quite fond of."
Yang: "Uh."
Ironwood: "Say hi to your girlfriend for me!"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omfg
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yang, on the airship home from the siege of Salem's Castle: "Oh Ironwood, I gotta thank you for that feature of yours."
Ironwood: "Oh yes, your welcome Yang."
Yang: "Ever use the turbo?"
Ironwood: "The what now"
Yang: "Ooooh you don't know... I'll tell you when you're older."
Yang: "I'm sure you can get Glynda to *come around* to it."
Anna (Cadmium): ~~why am i reading this i HC glynda as a lesbian~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~my favorite trope is James 'the importance of female friendship' Ironwood who is too dense to notice every girl around him is gay~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Never seen that trope.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I just needed a ship
Anna (Cadmium): i. i just read. a lot of fanfic
Anna (Cadmium): and i guess all the ironqrow shippers talk to each other
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): EEEEYUP
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Though I've never read ironqrow so that could be it.
Anna (Cadmium): ~~its my second fave ship after bees~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i have a lot of feelings~~
Jess (whoozica): <@334090409389195266>  thank you for dressform üôè I in you my life
