Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey anyone know of waterproof paint for the skin? I might be doing a future cosplay where I have to paint my skin a light purple, and I kinda wanna do it for next years Colossalcon.
Marisa (Weeb): Do you have an air brush, and/or will your head be going into the water?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Head won’t be going underwater and im planning on getting an airbrush!
Marisa (Weeb): nice! The only foolproof water-safe makeup that I know of uses airbrushes, though it's still ike $60+ for a container of it because it's theatrical makeup. airbrushes make really nice makeup tho

if your head isn't going in the water a cheap alternative is to get ben nye for your head and use bodysocks for the rest of your body. see if you can find waterproof tights that don't change color too much when wet and wear them over your legs and arms then just paint your head
Marisa (Weeb): ~~the ol' reliable homestuck method~~
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): <@!229713389511901185> proaiir body paint claims to be waterproof and there’s a lot of good reviews. I’m using them for colossal and might be getting an airbrush as well O:
Evie (Katheryne Knight): BLESS
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cause I might be doing this
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): YES DO IT!! I’m doing lapis and I think that waterproof paint plus a TON of sealer should keep it on for a while ( I’m also making arm socks tho so it’s just my neck/chest/face but I Lowkey want an underwater shoot. we’ll see how that goes. )
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna be my pirate queen from the Shantae games I love her. 
And it fits the summer/waterpark thing
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Either her or the title character Shantae
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I was hesitant on it but fuck it people will have to put up with my tummy
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Girl no ones gonna be thinking about that, you’ll look amazing!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thank you >\\<
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): np >:3 everyone should cosplay who they want~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): HELL YE
