Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oof bald tho.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): bill, do cardin
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yatsuhashi isn't bald
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Buzzed black hair
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Honestly probably wouldn't even really need to do a wig since the outfit and and weapon are more of his defining features
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But yeah do Cardin so you can beat me up when I do Jaune
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Meh. Yatsu is meh. If anyone cfvy it’d be Fox. 

Cardin’s another villain tho lol.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fox would be cool too!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Do Flint with Marisa's Neon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But Fox is still a mostly solo act, cause cfvy sporadic at things.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cardin you wouldn’t even really need a wig for
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hes also not really a villain, hes just a bully
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~he's an arc villain~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): is he though? hes just mean lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~a Jaune arc villain~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Does anyone *like* him.

Mark (Mad Doctor): <@334090409389195266> I have access to an authentic WWI uniform (that seems like it would be right for a male version of Peggy Carter, given that home guard wore older uniforms). It would fit a small man
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): How small 👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): We got someone who wants to do peggy with me but hes like average sized man
Mark (Mad Doctor): Like it might fit audrey (5'4" or so)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Damn. Prob wont fit him, but thank you!!
