Jess (whoozica): https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-14d8d72f97c5a8dde91117b63d503a2e
snow ( crescentbladed ): I would call the color ‘Roman torchwicks hair’
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): bruh, im at work and im cracking up alone in my office. someone just came in to ask me a question and i literally had to wipe away tears and hold in laughter.
snow ( crescentbladed ): _heh_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I see burnt orange as well. 

Jess, don't call me out like that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I still remember when Georgia was dying her Weiss fabric and showing me the bottles of dye. I was like "when did blue get so many variants".
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omfg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Jess (whoozica): IIRC blue has the most possible shades of any color
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd believe it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm exaggerating a little bit for the joke, but I was unable to tell the difference between adjustments in the dye pot.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm *really* bad at that, which is why working on the white balance in shots is miserable. How much of one color to add to another to get the color I actually want without making a completely new color.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (White balance is two scales, one blue to red which is the temperature of the light, and then the tint which is *green to purple*. That apparently makes white.)
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ((Also amusing, white balance is actually finding the grey point of an image, not the white. Knowing the neutral lets images represent the full spectrum of light and dark))
you want fucking rwby chibi?: im late but it looks like a red-orange/burnt orange (or like the colour called "maraschino" on that one image) but you could probably get away with red
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You want the white balance to make anything in the same tone as "V" accurate. Everything else falls into place.
Jess (whoozica): that v. interesting
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~is it I'm just babbling about camera theory~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~yea i know i just wanted to make the joke~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'll hush now
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i dont know what youre saying (bc i dont know anything) but im proud of you and it sounds neat
Dizzy: https://i.imgur.com/hXuK1cP.png
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): !hush
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Beautiful
Jess (whoozica): *resist urge to talk about color receptors*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you may have made a V joke but you still don't love him~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~actually what wasnt my intention BUT it was a photography joke so... also yes i do fu~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I couldn't hear you over the sound of you giving your undying love to Ray~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Jess (whoozica): ~~fight me biru~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'd win, lets be real~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I've mastered Snorlax-fu~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~we'll see about that~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): ~~What have you done~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~which one of us are you talking too?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you've seen that meme haven't you?~~
Erik (slendergiant): Found my Taiyang swimsuit https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-gzGHyyML._SL1000_.jpg

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *plz*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): some shades to go with
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Do iittt xD
Also in regards to the talk about Darling swimsuit colors... I'm painting the stripe on my Ichigo suit and imma just do red. Cause looks red to me 🤷🏻‍♀️
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): catch me mixing red and orange for hours until i get the exact shade ...~~ and probably not mixing enough and having to do it all over again a second time~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Exactly how many of you are doing Franxx at colossal east?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sounds like you have enough for a group thing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd bet Meg is doing 02.
Jess (whoozica): there is one
Jess (whoozica): a meetup i mean
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ethan has a group group going i think
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like besides the gathering
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): AH, cool. You got the numbers for it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he told me to do either kokoro or miku so i assume thats why
Erik (slendergiant): I'm not sure if Meg is going to Colossal... So far I know it's me, Ethan, Leanna, and Rebecca doing Darling
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): casey too
Erik (slendergiant): oh right yeah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Meg is, I do believe.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ What Erik said. Those are the only people I know doing Darling lol
snow ( crescentbladed ): Ur all gonna look rlly _darling_
snow ( crescentbladed ): ok I’ll leav
Erik (slendergiant): and according to FB *maybe* Dynamic Duchess
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You still have a decent number. You already are coordinating though so carry on.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Meg is going to East p sure
I plan on doing darling if I have somebody to pair with when I go -looks at Georgia who has yet to watch it-
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I think there's a lack of strong powerful redheads there~~ (Zero 2 is more pink and Meg has claim on it lol)
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Meg is definitely going lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I meant as far as Georgia cosplaying Franxx.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Meg going.
Erik (slendergiant): *~~meg~~ zero two the lightish red head*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): georgia should do miku, shes red headed xD
snow ( crescentbladed ): u sure it isn’t orange hair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GET OUTA HERELMao
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Well I mean to be Franxx,  I'm pretty sure I won't be grouping with Ethan for Franxx, (the man doesn't like me)  so there are a lot of potential pairs Georgia and I could do
I'd probably say kokoro Mitsu for us, especially since I'm already doing Mitsu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEEE DO IT
snow ( crescentbladed ): ~~should I do summer or ruby~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Why not both :o
Erik (slendergiant): I think Miku's hair is more of a *honey mist auburn*
snow ( crescentbladed ): >.....>
