Matt (mattmyers25): I want to make juniors bat. I was told to use Eva foam. Is there another material I could use for it?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Worbla!

*Disclaimer, the most I've ever crafted is foldering a box out of paper, with guide lines*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Maybe 2" pink insulation sheets with a wooden dowel as a core? Why not a whiffle bat though?
Matt (mattmyers25): I didn't think of that. I would just need to create the bottom part of the that then
