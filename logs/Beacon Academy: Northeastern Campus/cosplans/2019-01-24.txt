Georgia (Something Sensible): I put my to do list in chart form because visual organizer YEET
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): I have basically all of A2 left orz

Georgia (Something Sensible): _gotta make pyrrhas neckbeard_

It's too much work to do now with school back in session. I still have liek the majority to do... ~~I also never thought how to attach it to the pole soo oops. That puts me back some too.~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Jess (whoozica): hawt
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üëå
Rebecca (madameterralupus): She's beautiful
Anna (Cadmium): can we do a beacon uniform group one time
Rebecca (madameterralupus): PLEASE
Anna (Cadmium): i just want to have an easy to move in outfit pls
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've been wanting to do the uniform for a while but keep holding off on it lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): My initial Katso cosplays all require the full bushy neckbeard. While I hate to see Katsu end, I'm really looking forward to shaving on Sunday morning
Anna (Cadmium): lmfao leaving the hotel theyre gonna be like. who is this
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My one friend the other year started the weekend off with a full beard and shaved it to a different style each day until was finally clean shaven on Sunday. I was like... dude WHAT XD
Anna (Cadmium): thats commitment
Anna (Cadmium): ~~says the person who shaved half her head for a one time costume~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omggg
Anna (Cadmium): dont do that kids
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~almost committed to getting gwens hairstyle~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah, I think facial hair is for me what makeup is for a lot of other cosplayers.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Deff not. I've debated cutting my hair to have bangs so I can cosplay Velma w/o my wig but then I remembered growing out bangs is a biiittccch. So I was like lol nope! ~~plus i hate looking back at me w/ bangs. I was bad.~~
Anna (Cadmium): id say so you seem much less attached to your beard than others
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey pretty much has "the Gwen" already. She will eventually join the SouderGwen Army
Mark (Mad Doctor): These days, my default is the goatee. Buy beards and moustaches are such an easy way to establish a character (like Jacques or Tony Stark)
Anna (Cadmium): Yeah. Actually i'd say your facial hair is how we feel about colored contacts
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's a good analogy
