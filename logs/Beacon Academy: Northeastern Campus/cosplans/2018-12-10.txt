Rebecca (madameterralupus): Balake~ ðŸ˜¸
Gonna wear my own jeans with it at cons cause these pants suck and I need to fix the jacket cause sleeves don't give me much movement but other than that all fits pretty nicely! ðŸ¤—
Georgia (Something Sensible): friendos, anyone with experience with shaping garments, im doing some cosplay research for a particular cosplan, and need to make a more defined waistline. Should i be getting a corset, or another type of shapewear?
Georgia (Something Sensible): and if any particular recommendations exist those are appreciated too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what shape are you trying to achieve'
Georgia (Something Sensible): just a more exagerrated bust-waist-hip ratio
Georgia (Something Sensible): not like _jessica rabbit_ but more pronounced than i would have normally
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the best way to get that shape is to get a corset, BUT the problem with corsets is seasoning them and like they're really uncomfy until you get used to it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also a  "waist trainer" is way more comfy, its made of like scuba material and boning
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but you wont get as dramatic of an effect
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but you also dont need to season it either
Georgia (Something Sensible): cosplay is truly struggle oof
