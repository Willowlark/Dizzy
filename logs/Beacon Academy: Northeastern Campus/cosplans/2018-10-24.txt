Evie (Katheryne Knight): Tamaki is a GOOD BOI
Georgia (Something Sensible): someone messaged me complimenting my pyrrha from CCE
Georgia (Something Sensible): the one where i just wore a pyrrha wig and flannel
Georgia (Something Sensible): _this guy would be shook to know that i cosplay full pyrrha_
Georgia (Something Sensible): update: hes asking my permission for him to use a cosplay picture of me, because when he does Volume 4 Jaune he wants to give everyone the feels by taping a picture of Pyrrha to the back of his shield
Georgia (Something Sensible): people are interesting but i guess i dont mind lol
Marisa (Weeb): ohhhhhh golly that's a little odd. makes sense but also bit odd.
Jess (whoozica): ü§î
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ü§î Just tape a picture of actual Pyrrha on....?
Erik (slendergiant): At least he asked ü§∑
Georgia (Something Sensible): he said he would use a screenshot but a cosplayer would give a more real effect
Georgia (Something Sensible): i get it
Georgia (Something Sensible): quirky, but i get it lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahhh
Georgia (Something Sensible): somewhere in the world, a stranger will be carrying my picture for feels purposes
Georgia (Something Sensible): _whack stuff yo_
Marisa (Weeb): yeah it makes sense it just seems strange to ask someone you don't know but it's likely he doesn't know any pyrrhas
Georgia (Something Sensible): pyrrha cosplayers get more rare as we get farther from her death üò¨
Georgia (Something Sensible): like at RTX i know meg and gen and me were the big pyrrhas
Erik (slendergiant): *The Big 3*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~That react is perfect now lol~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah other than that i only remember the pyrrha thats like 6 foot that i think is a goddess
Georgia (Something Sensible): and the pyrrha that was with @thetrashcave i think is their instagram
Georgia (Something Sensible): otherwise i dont remember any more OOPS
Georgia (Something Sensible): and compare that to the like.... 30 rubys i see at every rwby shoot
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh and crimsoncrayoncosplay, i forgot her cause she was winter the day i was pyrrha
Georgia (Something Sensible): so thats like... 6
Georgia (Something Sensible): total
Erik (slendergiant): LITTLE RED RIOT HOOD READY TO PARTY HARDY
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can't wait to see this full outfit in person on Sat üòÇ
Erik (slendergiant): I'm lowkey very excited for it üòÇ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good! Ye should always be excited for a new costume no matter what it is üòù
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Also I am glad I won't be the only one showing a shit ton of leg and maybe some ass, that is if I could find my bottoms for Harley ugh~~
Erik (slendergiant): Yo my leg game is seeing as hell in this
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna be Pyrrha again but I need to get more foam to make her armor because I almost passed out at RTX. That‚Äôs why I dipped from the Friday photoshoot early. >_<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF MY CREATIVITY CAME BACK LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN HELP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HUGE MOOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): last night i decided to say  "fuck it" and design a huge elaborate star butterfly for katsucon and now it's the only thing i can think about
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I‚Äôm gonna do it. Ima try and do Pyrrha‚Äôs Crown tonight because I hate myself OwO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): DO IT DO IT DO IT
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/anakin-rjLINlGpJYvvO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Tempted to duct tape myself and actually pattern the rest of it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): do it, because if you do it then that gives me the incentive to also duct tape myself to finish penny >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we can be tape pals
Erik (slendergiant): So my new Taiyang shirt base is arriving today. Thinking about going to Joann's after work to pick out new fabric for the collar and trim! I decided I'm not going to splice another collar to this one like I did last time. I'm probably just going to cover it with the new fabric. Also going to add little snaps to the collar to make the leather piece that goes around it detachable so I can actually put it in the washing machine and not have to hand wash it
Marisa (Weeb): y'all i'm bout to make a **purchase**
Marisa (Weeb): i found a gift card
Jess (whoozica): üòÆ
Jess (whoozica): what buyin?
Marisa (Weeb): ben nye in what i think is my skin color ~~no grey just yet~~ because i think i'm almost out
thermoplastic pellets, modeling wax, a cheap contour palette to mess with, a 128gb sd card
2 meters of faux suede, 3 types of resin molds, horsehair braid, and some shoe sole inserts
Marisa (Weeb): oh fudge i might need new resin too
Marisa (Weeb): i'll wait for black friday to get the wig i need but i think this stuff maxes out the gift card
Jess (whoozica): dang fancy
Marisa (Weeb): i've decided to torture myself and make shoes from absolute scratch because just making covers wasn't enough
Marisa (Weeb): also do you think it's possible to put pockets in a hoop skirt without throwing off its balance üëÄ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Marisa (Weeb): that is the best thing i've ever heard
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): using historical accuate patterns you can make pockets meant for hoop skirts o3o
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH i figured something in history have to give but all i knew about was the giant breadbasket things people would tie around their hips
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): pockets were their own layer xD i think we need to start doing that again since womens pants never have fucking pockets
Marisa (Weeb): bless
Marisa (Weeb): roll up to the con like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMfAO
Marisa (Weeb): I have $20 on my gift card left. Do I wait and get a fancy wig on sale for like $30-40 or do I do what I always do and buy two cheap $10 wigs to combine into something vaguely passable
Jess (whoozica): wait and save you time and frustration
Marisa (Weeb): what about equal amounts of frustration for half the price
Marisa (Weeb): yeah i found the perfect awful wig i can throw in a bucket for a week, douse in powder, and then mutilate
Jess (whoozica): mawisa plz
Jess (whoozica): although i guess i shouldnt talk I buy alot of cheap wigs too
Jess (whoozica): Only "higher end" ones we have are all <@!351785752197201920> s
Jess (whoozica): ~~call out post~~
Marisa (Weeb): call out post for nice hair
Jess (whoozica): its ok what i save in wigs i can make up for in conacts now *mwhahaha*
Tom (tomukuncosplay): *flips hair in slow motion* "So you've finally noticed..."
Jess (whoozica): ~~it was the first thing i noticed, actually~~
Marisa (Weeb): senpai..........................................................
Erik (slendergiant): New base shirt for Taiyang and it has some really nice texture
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Wanted to measure my head for Pyrrha. Instead feels hella good in this wig and forgets what I‚Äôm doing
Georgia (Something Sensible): MMMM BEAUTY AND GRACE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THANK
Erik (slendergiant): So I've been looking for fabrics with some texture for my Taiyang shirt and I came across this corduroy that I thought looked kind of neat, but 1) I'm not 100% sure, and 2) I think the color is a bit off (like, too bright). Thoughts?
Georgia (Something Sensible): The white for underneath and red for the armband?
Erik (slendergiant): The base is like a tan/beige. The corduroy would be for the collar and trim along the bottom
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hmmm I see what you mean by it being a little vibrant
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think it all comes down to how it looks paired with the base shirt
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah imo it‚Äôs a little bright but it COULD work
Erik (slendergiant): ~~the fabric underneath *is* the base shirt~~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~well, it's fabric from the base shirt because I removed one of the pockets as a swatch~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ye I mean it‚Äôll look different wearing it versus compared with the square ya got lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause it‚Äôs such a tiny bit of orange anyways
Georgia (Something Sensible): IMO go a little less vibrant but choosing that one wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world
Erik (slendergiant): üëåüèª
Erik (slendergiant): There was another fabric that the color was much better but there wasn't too much special about the texture
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is that corduroy? Because that seems so Tai
Evie (Katheryne Knight):
