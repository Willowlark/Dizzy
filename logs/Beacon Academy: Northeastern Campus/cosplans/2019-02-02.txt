Erik (Red Riot Thot): So the fabric I got for Tai's arm bandanna honestly would have been the perfect color for the trim on the shirt. It just doesn't have the contrasting texture I was looking for
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Gonna dye the brown with a purple color to get the right shade
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEEE
Jess (whoozica): Damn looks awesome!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): coming out fantastic
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Aaahhh yess Leanna!!
Jess (whoozica): <@301927856240459777>  Tom has these you can borrow for Ray, they aren't technically dress pants, but you might be able to fake it by ironing a line down the middle üòÇ they are 28 x 30 men's
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Speaking of MM...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): FUCK ECHO GIRL
Jess (whoozica): God what a mood

Georgia (Something Sensible): <@!289944569410224129> how do I BREK the CHAINS
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wire cutters?
Jamie (Jamie): Anyone have knowledge on best way to make button hole like holes in fabric?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i used wire cutters on mine. or. u could probs use the cutting disc thing on le dremel
Anna (loud and likely blonde): uhhhhhhhhh. use the buttonhole setting on ur machine and pray
Anna (loud and likely blonde): <@!334090409389195266>  sewing question ur assistance needed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I second using the button hole setting and praying
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Drinking first helps
Jamie (Jamie): Uhhhh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): If you dont wanna do that then you can cut a slit in the fabric and hand sew around the hole to prevent fraying
Jamie (Jamie): 
Jamie (Jamie): I might do the hand sew thing just cause fuck im putting rope in the holes and not buttons anyway
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea if it's not hella visible hand sewing easier
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Buttonholes suck
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I am drained from work and read that as "buttholes suck" <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> ~~
Jamie (Jamie): Lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:lenny:456549338026344489>

Jess (whoozica): No probs fren. OH NO sew machine whyyyy?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): have u tried turning it off and then turning it on again
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but rlly pls work machine
Marisa (Mawisa): maybe i overworked it and it did a karoshi. my poor machine rip

Jamie (Jamie): I'm not sure what im doing for the formal except pick a dress and match it to a wig i can claim cosplay with
Marisa (Mawisa): yeah i have a ton of dresses so i'm not worried about having nothing to wear, but i like having canon outfits so that'll be the last thing i try. there is a really nice red dress i've wanted to wear forever though.
Marisa (Mawisa): one time a trash bag of brand new prom dresses was dumped on our doorstep and we don't know why or where it came from so we just kept it
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): The one for Miria?

Anyone looking for anything clothes wise I'm going to the rich white area of CT and going to Goodwill for a dress tonight
Anna (loud and likely blonde): O wait I committed to Weiss cause boy is borrowing Evie's boys wig
Marisa (Mawisa): the only formal rwby dress i have is pyrrha and i look bad as her. could possibly do formal neon? i think i'm bringing PJ neon for the pajama party if that's still a thing

Jamie (Jamie): I like to think im pretty good at it that dress i mentioned earlier was 3 bucks. My difficulty is i find the nice finds but they are made for the sticks that i am not
Anna (loud and likely blonde): M O O D
Anna (loud and likely blonde): at 5'7" and like 180lbs I am also not a stick why are pretty dresses and nice pants so hard to find
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~but when I find em they're perf~~
Jamie (Jamie): I think i found a really nice fluffy purple one time for 5 bucks and the size was like 3 too small. And other time it fits but it doesnt fit the chest and i go god damnit
Anna (loud and likely blonde): One time I bought a dress so I could take it in by like 4 sizes LMAO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): OH WAIT ughhhhh i have a really nice black and tan mermaid dress but it hella wouldn't look like Weiss would wear it. 
Maybe mag can wear it for Blake.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I still have my senior prom dress don't judge me
Jamie (Jamie): I did that once and then never followed through with taking it in and it sat in a box forever
Anna (loud and likely blonde): F
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh same anna, I still have both my prom dresses xD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): TBH let's be glad I wasn't into cosplay in high school I would have worn a wig to prom
