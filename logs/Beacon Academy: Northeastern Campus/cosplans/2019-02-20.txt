Erik (Red Riot Thot): Spent a good portion of last night and this morning looking for boots for cosplay... targeted advertising at its finest
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Welp, they're expensive af
Anna (loud and likely blonde): What kinda boot you looking for?
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Good boots usually are. I learned my lesson never to trust $15 Payless boots again.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeah it's honestly worth the splurge. For cosplay boots though I don't spend more than $50
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Unless they were originally $300 and are at Goodwill for $52 then my little thrifting fingers can't resist
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): My Todoroki boots on Saturday we're awful. I was wobbling like a new born Doe by the end of my photoshoot 😭
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Also fuck heels in general. Only thing I like about them is when I get to tower or some men.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, I've learned that finding good men's boots is a lot more difficult than women's. We don't have a lot of these "$50 boots" of which you speak. Also a lot less selection. I looked up a specific brand that I found on Ebay and they had like 80-90 different men's boots and over 300 women's boots
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like y'all can actually get boots at Payless. The only boots they have for men are hiking boots
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or faux Timbs
Jess (whoozica): Tom buys women's boots
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): True facts tho. Men's boots are almost all function and not fashion. I think the only variety of shoe men have a wider selection in is sneakers.
Jess (whoozica): But he's feet are on the smol side
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was actually looking at women's boots on Amazon lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Not a great selection in the size 12-13 range
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And <@471742493105324042> I completely agree
Jess (whoozica): Yeaaaaa he's a woman's 11
Jess (whoozica): So he can get away with it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Valid. 
Wait actually I have this. Random set of boots that are like size 12 that are mens and my brother doesn't fit so we tryna get rid of
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Oh <@386874959009415170> finding larger size women's shoes is a nightmare. I'm a size 10 (men's 8) and most stores stock very limited selection of sizes 8 and up.
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Try payless
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ;-; I got tiny feet for my height so all the shoes are sold out
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): They going out of business and have pretty quality sales rn
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Anyway, I'm looking for punky boots like this
Anna (loud and likely blonde): What
What do you mean Payless is going out of business
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): That's been the word in the streets
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh yeah, payless filed for bankruptcy so get your cheapo shoes while you can
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Yeah they got a BOGO sale goin on right now
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Any time I go to Ross or TJMaxx the size 6, 7, and 8 will have like an entire row of shoes. Meanwhile 9, 10, 11 will have half a row or less.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Need to stock up on their Airwalks
Jess (whoozica): Tom browses the women's clearance racks and seems to make out pretty well, he got some really nice ones at Target and I was jelly cuz my size was all sold out
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I'd say look at like. Alternative or rave sites for punky shoes around the next holiday
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestly I take what my mom cleans out of her closet lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I have no suggestions
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Give me ur size 8 shoes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I have tiny feet for a 5'7" human
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I don't have until the next holiday~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~need these for V2 Blake~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~in a month~~
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Sometimes you gotta go to a shady website and sell your soul
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): You can find them
Anna (loud and likely blonde): No use PayPal
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Ah shit you right
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): I've just been using some antiquated blood contracts
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Uhhhhh I'll let u Kno when my bro responds if he has the unworn punk boots cause none of us fit in then
Jess (whoozica): What is your size Erik?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): like 10.5-11 men's, 12-13 women's
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm checking out shoes.com and bless up because they have a 25% off code which makes a lot of these boots like $60
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.shoes.com/pi/pleas/jb/pleas241447_135692_jb.jpg
Erik (Red Riot Thot): there we go
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's Blake-y right?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): ooooof
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): you're already tall enough, stop trying to be taller!!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.shoes.com/pi/zotau/lg/zotau339272_185345_lg.jpg
Erik (Red Riot Thot): what the actual fuck are these
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *who the fuck left a 5 star review*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ***Great if you got flat feet**
I wanted a new look, something to give me that edge, sort of like a rockstar. I saw these boots and I knew it was something I had to have. After getting them, all I can say is that people can't stop commenting about them. they say 'nice shoes'.*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm pretty sure they were being sarcastic
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or this might be a troll review
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): that has to be a joke lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh bless up, Honey found me a coupon that gets me 30% off shoes.com
Marisa (Mawisa): wow nice shoes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The more I look, the more I think I'm just going to use my canvas boots but upturned. They may not be a high as I'd like, but honestly, those higher leather combat boots look uncomfy as fuck
Anna (loud and likely blonde): That's probs your best bet. Plus you said they're comfy right
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Uhhhhh so this happened
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tokoyami is that you?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lmfaoooo I do love my birb boi
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~if only I had the will power to wear a full head mask at cons again
Anna (loud and likely blonde): If only I had the willpower to wear a full head mask at cons again
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Lol let's not talk about cosplaying Tokoyami cause I've been high key considering it XDD~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~are birds still furries?~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~do it I'll help make the head if u want~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Uhhhhhhh yes
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~if i cosplay tokoyami no one will creep~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Also why did no one tell me that was a choker not tokoyamis neck
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I swear to god. I knew someone was gonna say something about furries when I said that....~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): no theyre downies
Georgia (Something Sensible): _i dated a furry before_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Apparently there's also Shellies now?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Either that or my brother is lying
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Shellies?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like... turtles and shit?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Like. Crabs. And clams
Georgia (Something Sensible): _what the fuck_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Interesting...
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I guess turtles too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I knew of scalies. But Shellies?? O.o
Anna (loud and likely blonde): What's a frog considered
Anna (loud and likely blonde): It doesn't have scales or fur or feathers
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *phibies*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I don't know how that word makes me feel
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Anyways *FUCK PRESENT MICS HAIR JFC*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I can't believe I just googled type of furries LOL!!
Georgia (Something Sensible): phibies sounds like youre saying titties but us p and b instead
Georgia (Something Sensible): pibbies
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Titties but like. U saying it as mineta
Georgia (Something Sensible): _i wanna see their phibbies_
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Hawt phib :/
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Good gracious
Georgia (Something Sensible): HAWT PHIB
Georgia (Something Sensible): good yes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Frogs are aquatic... so according to this wiki they'd be "Cetacean"
Georgia (Something Sensible): i only accept flirtatious advances if that phrase is used
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I stand corrected. Frogs are indeed scalies. It includes reptiles and amphibians.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Wow that's unfortunate
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Wait do scalies yiff or is it a different term
Georgia (Something Sensible): frogs make a kind of mrp sound
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They *croak*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): No I mean
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *yiff*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I know
Anna (loud and likely blonde): So what if you croak while croaking
Georgia (Something Sensible): they FUCK
Anna (loud and likely blonde): What if it's a furry and a scaley what is that called
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Is it yiffing or croaking
Georgia (Something Sensible): an abomination
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~opens incognito tab and searches "furry nomenclature"~*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I'm laughing too hard rn I think imma cough up a lung
Georgia (Something Sensible): the last time i spoke to my ex, she was drunkenly trying to take her shirt off at katsu two years ago
Georgia (Something Sensible): dont make this the reason i have to message her again LOL
Anna (loud and likely blonde): There are way more furries than just your ex don't worry
Georgia (Something Sensible): what a comforting thought
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think
Anna (loud and likely blonde): We shall consult the bronies before we have to involve your. Apparently exhibitionist ex
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ooof. No exes will be texted tonight. We got this shit on our own lol.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I used to have one on speed dial but she lost her US number when she went back to the UAE
Georgia (Something Sensible): "hey i know we ended on bad terms but... can you tell me what a furry fucking a scaly is called"
Georgia (Something Sensible): what a wild text that would be
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Jack is my go to furry
Rebecca (madameterralupus): omgg
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Read: 11:36 PM
Georgia (Something Sensible): some people text exes when theyre drunk and lonely
Georgia (Something Sensible): _i do it stone cold sober and asking about furries_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): The burning questions in life
Erik (Red Riot Thot): APPARENTLY NON-FURRIES ARE REFERRED TO AS "STEVES"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://dogpatch.press/2016/11/07/guide-to-furry-terms/
Georgia (Something Sensible): minecraft was made by furries CONFIRMED
Georgia (Something Sensible): i knew a murrsuit was a fursuit with a fuck hole
Mark (Mad Doctor): This is the best conversation I have ever woken up to
Evie (Katheryne Knight): What did I walk in to
Mark (Mad Doctor): I find it funny that the terms that bind furry and cosplay fandoms are "post-con depression" and "con crud." Some things are universal, I guess
Jamie (Jamie): I kinda want to do this sometime but no idea when lol
Jamie (Jamie): 
Jamie (Jamie): (This is from the webtoon "internet explorer" on webtoons)
Marisa (Mawisa): like, zoinks saitama
Jamie (Jamie): Yes
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Moth-chan is mega cute
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I kinda wanna cosplay Internet Explorer-chan (by the same artist as Moth-chan)
Matt (mattmyers25): Must refrain from tech jokes
Jamie (Jamie): no please all the tech jokes
Matt (mattmyers25): Will she freeze randomly?
Jamie (Jamie): I mean there is a strip where someone finally uses her and she totally freezes up trying to process the request lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Katsu just ended and I am already planning my next costume... why am I like thiiisss~~
Matt (mattmyers25): We are all like this
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I want to do a new RWBY but idk whooo lol~~
Marisa (Mawisa): do reese
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ehhhh. She cute but not really on my list XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe someday if I run out of ideas XD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Well what were you thinking? Someone from a recent season? Old?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): They tryna assemble all mothmen at katsu next year just a heads up 👀
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Been lately debating on the following: Fem! Adam, Yang vol 1, and Summer Rose
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I'd still want to see you do fem! Adam. I definitely think you'd make a pretty Summer. Yang would be interesting, probably something you could just buy somewhere pretty easily.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~haha sorry I'm not helping you be decisive cuz I like all those ideas~~
Jamie (Jamie): ~~moth chan temptation grows stronger~~
Jamie (Jamie): ~~would a moth chan in a group of mothmen be their queen, princess, or baby maker~~
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~baby maker, haha omg <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> ~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂 I feel like Adam needs to be next cause even though everyone hates him everyone seems to want me to be him?? XD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Yeah I think everyone wants you to do fem! Adam for memes and picture possiblities
Matt (mattmyers25): Then you can have leanna and and a Blake stab you
Jamie (Jamie): ~~DP~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao. Yes. Good. Only person allowed to do so is Leanna and Wish XD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~also cuz no one wants to risk approach some of the lot who cosplay him for pictures~~
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I know my Matt wants to cosplay him and I'm always like "Whyyyyy?!" He says part of him wants the strong reaction 😂
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I mean we could always use more non psycho adams
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I've decided I am going to remake my gambol shroud... what am I going to do with the old one..? Break it. >:D
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 🐝 🐝 🐝 🐝
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 🗡
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): BEEEEESSSSSS
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Legit. Gonna use it to retrace main base... then gonna fucking snap the shit out of it  for Bee stabbing usage XD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): If he's does follow through with Adam like likely going to be for CCE. I'm prolly then going to do vol 6 Yang so I can 🔪🔪🔪
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol free usage to all Bees of my soon to be broken gambol shroud to stab all Adams with~
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Idk why all my cosplans with Matt other than Kali and Ghira end up being violent. Like he's mentioned wanting to do Junior knowing I cosplay Yang.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD Violent couple cosplays legggooo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Don't worry. Im kinda the same. I have like a list of duo cosplays I wanna do with a future SO that are angst and violent. LMFAO~~
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~I'd need more lovey dovey ideas he'd actually agree to~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): I wanna Rebecca's Tinder profile where she requests a non-abusive partner willing to cosplay an abusive partner...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMAO
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was thinking it would be cool to have an app that facilitates meetups for cosplayers. You'd enter your name/contact info, fandoms/characters cosplayed, location, and range you'd be willing to travel to events or shoots.  Then the app would alert you to like-minded cosplayers in your area
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ooohh that would be cool 😮
