Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Restarted Summers cape but I'm following the pattern this time
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So it actually lays properly
Mark (Mad Doctor): Breastplate nearing completion!
Anna (the Yang who dipped blake): u give me hope.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ok, question for all you worbla fans out there: Audrey wants me to make a choker that consists of two parallel rings that go around her neck with support pieces that hold them apart.  How flexible is worbla (two sheets thick around a thin craft foam core) once it is heated and worked. If I make the rings like a torch, going 90% of the way around her neck, will she be able to squeeze her neck in by pulling the pieces apart, or will the worbla snap and break?  Or should I only finish the rings at about 2/3 of the way around her neck, using more flexible foam to secure it in place?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Worbla stretches pretty good, especially with a thin foam base
Georgia (Something Sensible): That‚Äôs how my Pyrrha neckpiece works!
Anna (Cadmium): if she was gonna put it on by moving the pieces apart like opening a slinky/up down instead of pulling it apart like on the same axis worbla would be okay. I found it fatigues if you have all the forces going on a very small area though so really how thin is this necklace?
Mark (Mad Doctor): The two rings are only about a centimeter wide each. Maybe I'll just set it around her neck and make her wear it until katsu
Jess (whoozica): does anyone have any ideas on how i could go about making this without worbla or 3d printing?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): WOOD
Jess (whoozica): ~~or wood~~ üò≠
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or foam with an aluminum rod for stability
Jess (whoozica): im wondering if that while "only attached by two little points" thing is like even possible without falling apart
Jess (whoozica): i might be able to pull it off with wood if i can request help from my dad ü§î
Erik (Red Riot Thot): for the blade you could have an aluminum flat bar sandwiched between foam
Erik (Red Riot Thot): for the hilt part.... not so sure lol
Jess (whoozica): hmmm ~~how does one cut aluminum?~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): easily
Erik (Red Riot Thot): you can cut it with a hack saw
Jess (whoozica): ooooo <@!351785752197201920>  do we have a hack saw? XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the stuff I'm talking about is only 1/16" thick
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or 1/8"
Jess (whoozica): what about this?

Tom (tomukuncosplay): I think so
Georgia (Something Sensible): I would ask zeikani, I think she made one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ooooh no I'm talking about this
Georgia (Something Sensible): Granted it was Worbla but she might have some pro strats
