Anna [Cyborg]: Does anyone have experience attaching boot covers to boots without making them look horrible
i need to add a white stripe up some boots
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Permanently attach or temporary?
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): If permanently get yer self a thimble because sewing stuff to shoes is ow. You could also use hot glue depending on the shoe material 
If temporary is easy
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh god I blanked and thought someone in my work slack was asking about boot covers.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need more coffee.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This is not slack.
Anna [Cyborg]: its like a big white stripe up a boot like. voltron style. and a toe cover. i  just dont wanna paint on the boot cause  i like them lmao.

and a tread glued on the bottom
