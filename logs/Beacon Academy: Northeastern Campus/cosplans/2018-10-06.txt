Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yooo your Suki looks so good!!!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What have I stumbled upon....
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This is just like a random file folder that was in my costume box
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): With photos printed on ... regular white printer paper... I'm fucking laughing
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!334090409389195266> I want to low key cosplay Suki
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Help XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): DO IT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Aaaaah
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I still have my ayu backpack from my first cosplay <@184437198865563648>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 😍
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <@334090409389195266>  you're Thor right?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Or wait...
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Hmmm
Tom (tomukuncosplay): It's hard to tell, I'm a failure
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm loki
Tom (tomukuncosplay): FAK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BOI
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Shit wait I've seen that cosplay too!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Rippp
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Regardless you should NOT be mortified! It looks great 👌👌👌👌
Tom (tomukuncosplay): For some reason the lighting is making it super hard for me to determine facessss agggghhh
Tom (tomukuncosplay): It's dat sweet Tech fashion show lighting
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO they tried so hard
Tom (tomukuncosplay): **Every year**, it was such a big deal. Poor Pali lost years of his life over stress from that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): He really did, poor man.
Jess (whoozica): The year they did the power rangers that man sang the power rangers song everyday in varying amounts of enthusiasm
Tom (tomukuncosplay): go.....go.....po...wer.......rang.....ers......
Jess (whoozica): I think he drive himself nuts with how often it was stuck in his head 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): He would scream it at least once a day
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I am going to try and pull together Shinoa Hiragi from Katsu and I plan to make her scythe. I usually make all my props out of wood but that'd be hella heavy if I did it that way XD So imma use EVA foam for the blade and such... only issue is idk what glue works on that type of foam that won't melt it. I haven't used EVA foam before 😩 
Anyone use this material before and know what does and doesn't work??
Erik (slendergiant): Contact cement
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thank you!!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If no one responded I was gonna message you cause you made your Gambol Shroud out of EVA foam yea? XD
Jess (whoozica): 🤔 contact cenemt works for everyone for me, magnilds held together with mostly contact cement
Jess (whoozica): That and hot glue
Jess (whoozica): You have to apply it to both things you are trying to stick together, wait for it to dry, and then stick it
Erik (slendergiant): I think you can also use super glue on EVA
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I plan to do the pole base out of PVC pipe so can get the funky shape to it. The blade part is what im hoping to do out of EVA so it can be light weight and I can sand it into shape easily lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol also I showed this to my dad the other night and he was like why can't you ever make anything normal XD
Erik (slendergiant): This part you're going to want to make out of wood. You're going to need something sturdy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was planning on doing that all out of PVC to get that funky shape but do you not think it'd hold up even if the blade is EVA foam? 😮
Erik (slendergiant): Or make it out of foam and add aluminum supports inside (like my Gambol Shroud sheath)
Jess (whoozica): Damn gurl
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I also thought of doing the base pol out of wood and having my dad help me get the shape and maybe put nails in them for supports like he did with my Gunchuck barrels
Tom (tomukuncosplay): could add a clear support here too
Tom (tomukuncosplay): no idea what material tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): .Ohhh that's a smart idea 😮
Tom (tomukuncosplay): if anyone knows any clear strongmaterial to fill in my logic lmao
Erik (slendergiant): Probably acrylic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Acrylic is HEAAAAVY
Erik (slendergiant): If you only have a small piece as that little support it shouldn't be too bad
Mark (Mad Doctor): A clear plexiglass 1/4" dowell might do the trick
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I can see what my coworkers at work suggest for it too. The one seems pretty knowledge in weird stuff like that XD. I think I close with him Thurs 🤔
Erik (slendergiant): Got my new Kiri wig. They even sent me a wig cap that matches the color 👌🏻
Mark (Mad Doctor): Nice
Jess (whoozica): Nicuuuu what company?
Erik (slendergiant): Kasou
Jess (whoozica): That's awesome
Erik (slendergiant): 
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Hey just read your messages about the scythe <@!169297844874903552>  you can heat form pvc pipe!!!! It’s a slow going process but it’s very easy to do!! All you need is a heat gun, the pvc pipe would hold up really well and still be light and durable!!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh I'll have to look into trying that!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thanks!!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So I think Toga is happening for Zenkai
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Idk what to do for Chris’s Shigaraki make up
Jess (whoozica): YES GOOD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We need a Dani
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *Dabi
Jess (whoozica): liquid latex? anndd cottom maybe?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Maybe. I’m thinking just cover his eyebrows and do some heavy contouring
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I need to play around with techniques
Jess (whoozica): I dont really know anything about effects make up but i know a friend of a friend who uses that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I can’t do anything too heavy only because I don’t want to torture Chris and honestly it isn’t too too intensive
Jess (whoozica): is he open to body paint? cuz i think you coulod pull it off with just that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s what I was gonna do
Jess (whoozica): you can does it! i think with a few shaes of purple and black yohu should be good
