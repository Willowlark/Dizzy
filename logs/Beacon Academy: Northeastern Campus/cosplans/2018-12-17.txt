Marisa (Mawisa): Throwin in a reminder to check Katsu‚Äôs prop and cosplay guidelines to make sure all the cool stuff you‚Äôre planning will be allowed on the con floor

And take into consideration elevator door width and crowds, you may have to assemble parts of your costume on the con floor rather than the hotel room if you can‚Äôt get into an elevator (I had to do that with crescent rose when the elevators were crowded and that is 5‚Äôx5‚Äô
Jess (whoozica): üëå
Marisa (Mawisa): I think 5‚Äô is the maximum height for Katsu. If it‚Äôs not 5‚Äô then it‚Äôs five and a half or six feet but their website will say what it is for sure
Matt (mattmyers25): This will be interesting with my qrow sword lol
Jess (whoozica): Ooo I should check then, magnhild is 5'6"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I gatta check the guidlines then for Strelitzia‚Äò spear
Marisa (Mawisa): They‚Äôre really starting to crack down on cosplay props. At least, we are at Zenkaikon and the lady who runs zenkai‚Äôs cosplay unit also does Katsu‚Äôs I‚Äôm fairly certain, so I presume they‚Äôre cracking down on it there too
Jess (whoozica): Hmm I don't see a home limit on the site
Marisa (Mawisa): I was on coco chasing duty at zenkai because every time a coco cosplayer walked by the boss would be like ‚Äúgo make sure they prop checked their mini gun‚Äù
Marisa (Mawisa): Lemme see
Jess (whoozica): https://www.katsucon.org/faqs/attendee-policies/#props
you want fucking rwby chibi?: good thing the sword im Hoping to bring should be under 2-3 feet
Marisa (Mawisa): You right. That‚Äôs really weird.
Marisa (Mawisa): There definitely used to be a size restriction. Maybe everyone kept breaking it and they got fed up.
Marisa (Mawisa): For Zenkaikon if anyone is already making props, ours is definitely a 6‚Äô limit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Well i'm fucked for Kiri...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't think shirtless sleeves will suffice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~~but there definitely have been shirtless dudes there I'm sure...~~*
Marisa (Mawisa): üôÄ ~~yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve seen shirtless dudes~~
What about a muscle shirt?
Marisa (Mawisa): Instant mega abs and abides by the rules
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i see people with just. bandaids on their nipples all the time at katsu what
Marisa (Mawisa): If it‚Äôs outside technically that‚Äôs ‚Äúoutside‚Äù Katsu and OK, I see a bunch of lewd stuff happening outdoors
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think you'll be fine as Kiri Erik. I've seen guys do shirtless costumes before and didn't get in trouble.
Also lol welp better go check height limit so I'm safe with my scythe for Shinoa will pass lol
Marisa (Mawisa): It also says the shirtless thing is the Gaylord‚Äôs wish not the con‚Äôs <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Mawisa): Karen in housekeeping might pass out due to your shirtless ness but Sakura in line management will be fine
Jess (whoozica): Ok I just got really confused cuz my mom's name is Karen and she is in housekeeping
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But with it being exclusively con-goers and no outside people, there won't be any middle aged moms to piss off with our inappropriate attire, so it would only be the hotel staff that would care
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wow Jess, I didn't know your mom worked at the Gaylord
Jess (whoozica): Lmao I mean not at the Gaylord but
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~it was a joke lol hard to type sarcasm~~
Matt (mattmyers25): But no one prop checked me last year so
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ You did get stopped for your rifle though XD
Marisa (Mawisa): We gotta keep Erik away from Jess‚Äôs mom and everything will be fine
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *italics are great for sarcasm*
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i use two backslashes (//) at the end of a sentence and i stole that from my bf
Jess (whoozica): ~~i knew it was sarcasm I'm just awkward~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm just going to post this everytime I try to be sarcastic
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://youtu.be/Fb7qK8jor-A
Marisa (Mawisa): Today‚Äôs cons are so tame. Remember yaoi paddles.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~yes~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Rebecca‚Äôs dark yaoi paddling past: revealed
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Lolllll
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Guys
I have an urge to get swole and cosplay Bakugo
Marisa (Mawisa): Don‚Äôt let your memes be dreams
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It might happen
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I wanna be best anger
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i might have bought a spidergwen zentai suit immediately after seeing the spiderverse movie, might be bringing her to katsu~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~GOOD~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): on that note, how are ardas undercut wigs?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~don't read the comics, it'll ruin the love~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@!334090409389195266> I only have experience with the Kyle undercut wig which is probably too short for Gwen, but it's still pretty nice. I'm sure the Jess would work just fine
Jess (whoozica): hello? XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jess im gonna have to scalp you for my gwen cosplay
Jess (whoozica): shit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1409/1418/products/49551d01-c24f-44de-a4c1-f0ff8e9f2877.jpg?v=1542731161
Jess (whoozica): well if thats the way it gotta be
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1409/1418/products/a95ac052-6da8-4abb-b23b-685c86949be6.jpg?v=1542731161
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I would say either of those two would be your best options and then just cut to length
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeaaa i was looking at those, do you have pictures of the kyle? is that the one you use for goro?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I use the Kyle for Scarlet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH right i forgot you  did scarlet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): RIP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok yea, that looks like it could work, thank you!  i was mostly worried about how the undercut part lays, but it looks pretty good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I can take some pics when I get home
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh! that would be great! thank you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So if Jamie and Jason don't do Trigun to Zenkai should I fill in my random empty spot with that Dinosaur Grimm I was going to try to do? ~~Since I got that skull from work~~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: my wigs came in uvu
you want fucking rwby chibi?: two weeks ago and my parents hid the box from me in attempt to give them to me for christmas instead <:blake_perish:405597356797591552>
you want fucking rwby chibi?: as if i Dont need to style them for katsucon :^)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): MY CONTACTS WERE DELIVERED <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO what costumes are the wigs for? And yayy!
you want fucking rwby chibi?: alex oxenfree and catra!! the base wig for alex bc i already had the ponytail, and just. everything i need for catra's hair (which means +wefts for the lighter coloured parts so i gotta glue/sew those in some time before i style i
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh cute! üòÑ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need to watch She-Ra cause the characters seem super cool. Catra looks really cool lol
you want fucking rwby chibi?: its so fucking gay
you want fucking rwby chibi?: its fantastic
Jess (whoozica): Ooo I gotta watch that too it's on my list üëå
you want fucking rwby chibi?: yessssss
you want fucking rwby chibi?: get into she-ra and help me convince georgia to cosplay adora /j
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Georgia (Something Sensible): I liked the first epi, I‚Äôll marathon it over break
you want fucking rwby chibi?: \:D
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay another question on EVA foam, what glue is best to hold pieces of it together? ü§î
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Contact cement
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Heat seal first
Mark (Mad Doctor): Agreed.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thank and noted!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is it dumb of me to put an entirely new armor build on my list for Katsu?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What kind of armor?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh whatcha planning? üòÆ
Mark (Mad Doctor): This guy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh!! üôå
Erik (Red Riot Thot): O o f
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Think you can hang that out in 8 weeks?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Katsu is 8 weeks away? O.o~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): How hard could it be? üòÅ
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Oooh <@386567060026556417> lemme be your Loki
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'll be happy/proud/disappointed to have you as my son
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): If your looking for a glue to use on foam definitely barge contact cement!! The only thing that I haven‚Äôt been able to glue with barge is worbla. Although in my experinace hot glue works best with worbla because of the heat
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Noted! Thank! üòÑ
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): No problem!! Just be careful when working with it inside. Wear a respirator or work in a ventilated area, because I‚Äôve passed out twice in the past month from barge fumes üòÖ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol noted. I'll try to work on it in my garage then instead of the basement XD ~~Don't need my dad yelling at me for stinking up the house either lol~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Good idea!! Pls learn from my mistakes üòÇ
Mark (Mad Doctor): So that's where all my brain cells went. Good news, Alcohol, you're off the hook!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): BIG MOOD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I'll also just have to dig out the big industrial heater if we still have it so I don't freeze in the garage. But I think freezing is less concerning than barge fumes XDD~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): *donkey voice* LAYERS
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yeaaa my dad said I can't use heater cause of fumes. Could explode house ~~didnt think of that~~ So layers it is! *Time to become and onion~*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): One of my contacts is the *wrong prescription*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They sent me a -3.50 instead of a -3.75 so I don't know how much of a difference it'll really make but like, it's my non-astigmatic eye...
Jess (whoozica): It shouldn't make too much of a difference
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ^
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Still gonna complain
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I double checked my order and it was right
Jess (whoozica): Yea def tell them about it, but it should still be usable
you want fucking rwby chibi?: the only time i wore 2 contacts of diff prescripts was one -7.00 and one -6.00, and all i got was a headache. i Assume bc theyre an Entire Step difference but ya
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Jess (whoozica): And you said they wouldn't do anything üòè
Erik (Red Riot Thot): From far away they don't look too different
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also since it's blue on brown it looks more green
Jess (whoozica): Were they free? üòÆ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No, I bought 2 pair
Jess (whoozica): Aw ok well I think they look nice and they will probably show up well in pics at least
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
you want fucking rwby chibi?: oh funky
Jess (whoozica): Oooo those are awesome
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I am making this fucking scythe way more complicated then it needs to be XD I saw we had glow in the dark lime green paint so I was like oh that'd be neat but we only had it in tiny bottles. So I just spent 15 minutes running around the store with Mark (my coworker) looking at all the glow in the dark paint options we had XD 
It doesn't need to be glow in the dark... but I *want* it to be cause damn that'd be cool looking
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I also almost bought a can of glow in the dark spray paint for $20 so I could do this glow in the dark thing... but was told no cause that's to pricey for how little I need lol. Bless good coworkers who help you watch your money and not spend it on ridiculous things üëå ~~
