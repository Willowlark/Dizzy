Hello zonbi
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): are there any examples anywhere of the contents? like a preview?
it such an expensive book :0
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://youtu.be/AurVZjMgeoo
Erik (Red Riot Thot): She just posted some progress updates but that gives you an idea
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but considering she wrote it, took all the photos for it, formatted it, and had it independently published makes it seem like a fair price
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm sure editing and publishing costs are what is driving the cost
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): tru
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And she probably only gets to keep a fraction of it
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: i think she said something about  a pdf in a video but idk i could be wrong
