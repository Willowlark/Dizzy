Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Ok but that's so smart

Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~unless your chris~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So Joanns has dance/swim solid knit fabric
Evie (Katheryne Knight): in the perfect colors
Evie (Katheryne Knight): it's 10 bucks a yard though fuckin ouch
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: But lol I forgot they had like. Canon art bathing suits or something. I was just gonna wear a black bikini for Jirou If I wear her in the park
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Uhhhhh there's. A coupon rn
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: At least u only need like 1.5 yards
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh shit yeah you're right.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They don't have it at my store though, so I'd have to get two yards since that's the limit for shipping.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Honestly with a coupon that's worth it. Otherwise like actually check Amazon
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I got my silver spandex there lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's probalbly what I'd do
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I also need Peachskin for my Summer cape, and eventually to remake Chris's Qrow cape
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Capes are so annoying tbh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They are...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): IT sucks cause they aren't hard
Evie (Katheryne Knight): just tedious as fuck
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: And so much fabric
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that too, and if you want a good cape, you have to invest in good fabric.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): which costs money
Evie (Katheryne Knight): cause you need like 8 yards
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I gotta make what I thought was a cape and no. Turns out it's a long jacket that the guy NEVER uses the sleeves on
Evie (Katheryne Knight): and I need a lining, so I need 16 yards total. 8 for the main part, and 8 for th elining.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Jfc
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I wanted to die making that stupid cape
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Whelp. Memorial day sales this weekend?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): but it was worth it
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: What's the secret to not dying bc I'mma kill myself doing Black Jack bc his stupid coat
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Um... basically I was crunched for time so I just plowed through it until it was done 2 days befor eleaving for Katsu
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: So the answer is 'nearly die'
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Basically.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They are so tedious...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ugh
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): So I'm painting my sailor Uranus shoes <they are white and need to be navy blue > how does one go about that ? What is some good techniques and materials I would need?:)
