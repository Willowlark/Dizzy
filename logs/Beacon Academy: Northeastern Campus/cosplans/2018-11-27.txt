It came in an amazon box and I was like what I didn't ordered anything from there O.o and then bam suprise Weiss~! XD
Also interesting though that Blake didn't come with it and is being shipped via a different carrier 🤔  Must be coming from different warehouses lol
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Yeah they have different warehouses, but the ones I bought came in very quickly too
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Yeah alot of amazon carriers have micc stuff I've seen it on their website

Halim (Greg) (jake): You are terrifying 
You can do flips in heels?? To much power in one person
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~well see what 2019 brings~~
Halim (Greg) (jake): ~~do it~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~I do flips in heels a lot when I’m drunk so like that means I can do it sober right???~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Probably not.

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Gatta find me a Roman to seduce along the way
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The video of the gif Bill sent is better 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgxZP5upA8Y
Halim (Greg) (jake): Oh lord
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it is.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Tbh the hardest part of cosplaying neo for me is going to be the not talking part because I am a LOUD GORL
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): True.
Halim (Greg) (jake): Your much more of a Black Star(soul eater) than a Neapolitan as far as volume goes
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ACCURATE
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): LOUD AND OBLIVIOUS
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Girl I talk all the time as Neo because trying to find a sign that doesn’t cramp your hand is a bitch
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like
I gave up after 30 minutes of having that damn white board cause my hand was C R A M P I N G
Mark (Mad Doctor): Neo: Charades Champ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And trying to glue a flat surface to a dowel rod is a binch
Halim (Greg) (jake): plus if you consider meghans spelling skills , her whiteboard would be much confusing
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I know that I just don’t feel like dealing with the assholes that are all “your neo your not supposed to talk” because the amount of times shitty fanboys have given me shit for cursing while in Pyrrha is enumerable
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh I ignore those people
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ,...
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WOW FUCK YOU HAL
Halim (Greg) (jake): ❤
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): People seriously just say that?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): the cursing thing?
Jess (whoozica): Wow people are assholes
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): normally I’d just tell them to fuck off at that point but it’s still disheartening to hear
Mark (Mad Doctor): "I'm not that kind of Pyrrha's, fuckface"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I don’t talk during shoots but I talk when I’m with friends 

I’ve also been considering trying to learn sign language 

Wait people give you shit for cursing as Pyrrha what the nani
Jess (whoozica): People can be so weird with cosplays I stg
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It happened a couple times at katsu and a few times when I was first starting to cosplay Pyrrha
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also when people tell you you shouldn’t be talking as Neo, flip them off
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And I’m just like YOU REALIZE IM NOT ACTUALLY HER RIGHT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's fucking *amazing*, how hard it is to not be an asshole? I'm shy with new people and I know fucking better.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s sign language for “fuck you” XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah people give me shit for not fucking them while I'm dressed as Tai. It's such a pain
Jess (whoozica): Don't worry..   I won't talk... To you
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ERIK I SWEAR TO GOD
Jess (whoozica): ERIK 😂
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I think someone gave shit to Chris for it drinking as Qrow and it’s like “he’s underage my dude” XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): his flask is filled with good ol W A T E R
Jess (whoozica): What is wrong with people
Halim (Greg) (jake): Apparently when you cosplay tai your supposed to be ok with people calling you "daddy"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m just tired of the “your personality better fits (insert character here)” if I wanted to cosplay them DO YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE?!???
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yo I’ve gotten you’re too fat for x characters all the time

Sorry ya’ll are cowards for thicc women
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YO THICC THIGHS SAVE FUCKING LIVES
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): If you disagree your just too weak 💁🏼‍♀️
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Sorry my hips bulge out of my POLYESTER PANTS
Jess (whoozica): WHAT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes when I cosplay Pyrrha I get “FUCK YEH T H I C C”
Mark (Mad Doctor): "What makes you think you can cosplay Penny, meat-bag?"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like make up your mind????
Jess (whoozica): What the fuck is wrong with people
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *You shouldn't cosplay Blake because you don't have actual cat ears*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): DO YOU WANT THICC OR NOT 

Actually scratch that you’re gonna get THICC cause I honestly have tried getting rid of this flab and I’m tired

Halim (Greg) (jake): ~~ok but what flab though~~
~~I'm sorry but so many of yall talk about bein flab or something~~
~~but like if yall got rid of as much as you talk about I'd be concerned~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Boi did you not see my bikini like I got double gut 

But that’s what happens when you lose 100lbs so
Jess (whoozica): I have a pouch of extra skin that I usually refer to as my "flab"
Jess (whoozica): YEA that's what mines from too not 100 but ye

Jess (whoozica): YEAH
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Lower intestines DONT NEED THOSE
Jess (whoozica): YEET them away
Halim (Greg) (jake): I've had a roll all my life
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): FUCK A SPLEAN
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THAT DOES ANYWAY
Halim (Greg) (jake): and I was a literal twig
Jess (whoozica): YE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Let me yeet my uterus I’m not gonna use it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It brings me pain
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Nothing but pain
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And emotions I don’t ask for
Jess (whoozica): Fucking mood
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): BIG BOG MOOD
Jess (whoozica): Literally pl
Jess (whoozica): So many moods plz take them from me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like being Bipolar 2 is hard enough with E S T R O G E N E
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And your Uterus being all like “IM GONNA MAIE YOU HURT AND IM GONNA BULDGE LIKE A BINCH”
Jess (whoozica): Fuck hormones

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Let me cosplay
Let me have fun with Chris
IN P E A C E
Let me wear a bikini without the bottoms never fitting right
Jess (whoozica): No extra skin we can just chop that off
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Slice it like the grape that had surgery
Jess (whoozica): You know what? No bodies
Jess (whoozica): Who needs a corporol form anyway
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I read that as a car pool form~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Jess (whoozica): I don't need that either
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Halim (Greg) (jake): I read it as corporal form 
Like the military rank
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ I did too XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): can't find a gif of Morgana transforming.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _how do people critique you for saying fuck as pyrrha_
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean I’ve always gotten away with it but also Jen Brown said fuck at RTX
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It’s “un Pyrrha-like” because I use my real hair for her ppl think I’m just like her in personality. And I’m just like???? Have one convo with me and you’ll realize how wrong that actually is
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WAT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But like your natural hair looks great for Pyrrha and I WISH I could do that with my hair for cosplay?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like fuck them
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It boggles my mind when nerd bois say I’m just like her. Like if you think so you have NOT being paying attention at all 😂
Jess (whoozica): even saying that to someone is so objectifying
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you might  LOOK just like her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): What cosplay has taught me is that ppl have a VERY hard time separating the cosplay from the cosplayer
Jess (whoozica): "I aint yo waifu"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): personality-wise, no
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I AM NOT YOUR RED HEAD ANIME WAIFU
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): LEAF ME ALONE
Jess (whoozica): FOR REAL
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Literally the main reason my last relationship failed ~~besides the distance~~ was that he put waayyyyyyy too much of jaune and Pyrrha into our actual relationship and I wasn’t about that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Won’t lie when I was younger I had trouble but older me has no problem.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah the comments of “you ARE Pyrrha” are kinda weird
Georgia (Something Sensible): I know people are well intentioned but
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ehhhh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like Chris and I love being in characer but we aren’t Winter and Qrow or Neo and Torchwick irl
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It’s an unsettling compliment
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah it’s unsettling
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I’m glad I’m not Winter irl 
She’s got metal rods up her ass
Halim (Greg) (jake): I can never get over how 'you ruined arkos for him'
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I love her but damn woman relax
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YALL ARE REAL PPL WHO JUST HAPPEN TO LIKE THE SAME SHIPS AND CAN ACT THEM OUT WELL
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I guess yeah I overlap some traits with Pyrrha but simplifying me down to inaccurately depict me as a character is weirdddd
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg poor morningmist people have been calling her ice princess and shit
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah like when people actually treat me as Winter it’s like “bruh”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like that’s just weird
Jess (whoozica): yea people can def take it way to far
Georgia (Something Sensible): You may be a Schneester but Gen is still Gen, not Winter
Georgia (Something Sensible): I also love the “you look just like her” cause I know those are well intentioned too but I stare at the 3D models like _o rly_
Jess (whoozica): yea i mean, can you *really* looks just like anime character?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Overlaping traits with a character is fine! That’s usually what draws you into the character but being simplified to a 2D fictional character isn’t what it’s cracked up to be
Halim (Greg) (jake): I mean theres that chick who strives to look exactly like Barby
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): “You look just like her” I sure fucking hope so this makeup took 2 hrs
Jess (whoozica): yea thats the part that creeps me out
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I love having major big dick energy when I can part a crowd with my unintentional death glare
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But I’m not like that 24/7
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): FUCKING GOALS GIRL
Jess (whoozica): yea like end of day you are a real person
Evie (Katheryne Knight): RTX was a fucking experience
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I literally parted the crowd because according to HearlessAquarius I have a death stare
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): THATS GOOD ACTING
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hats off to ya
Halim (Greg) (jake): That's that good shit
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): A TRAIT YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THATS MY MAJOR I HOPE IM DOING OKAY
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I went to@school for this shit gotta put it to use
Georgia (Something Sensible): Death Glares 101
Halim (Greg) (jake): A MOOD (it's only my minor but still)
Jess (whoozica): im terrible at acting and have no idea how to be in character like half the time whooo
Georgia (Something Sensible): If you aren’t exploiting your major for cosplay then are you really using all your resources to cosplay
Georgia (Something Sensible): Jess you just smack people with your hammer and love tom, that’s like 99% of the way there
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): drink, get happy, nora.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you're fine jess jess.
Jess (whoozica): nora doesnt drink D: das illegal
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also were I more into the costume bit, the acting aspects would be a highlight to me.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I love being Neo too
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I get to be a mischiviois lil shit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm really bad at getting into character unless it's scripted
Jess (whoozica): na noras not too hard really, 2b is hard though cuz i feel like i have to act SUPER SERIOUS all the time
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mood I couldn’t keep Weiss together for two minutes in character
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I can’t wait to cosplay Futaba and hide behind Chris
Jess (whoozica): the happy  peppy characters are easier as long as im not half asleep
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like with Tai, I basically just smile and throw finger guns ~~which he doesn't even really do in the actual show~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But like, I can't always come up with puns and dad jokes on the spot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ he should~~
Jess (whoozica): YE like when i cosplay seven i just meme and thats it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *A G R E E D*
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s why it’s always good to have that ONE THING to do when people catch you off guard
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like the finger guns thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): For Pyrrha I just smile and wave
Jess (whoozica): oh true i usually try to have one of those
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): do ya'll have a character that youre just like 100% comfortable in though? like you dont feel like you have to do much to be  "in character" ~~or is that just me~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): My go to thing for Pyrrha is whenever ppl are doing introductions I wave a give a “helllllllo again!” But other then that I’m not good at acting out as her charcter
Georgia (Something Sensible): Uhhh Pyrrha I don’t have to do too much
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's a bit on Pyrrha though.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Part of cosplaying Pyrrha was because I’d cosplay Weiss and be “HELLO!!!” And then smite myself for being so OOC
Halim (Greg) (jake): Not in rwby
Jess (whoozica): 🤔
Halim (Greg) (jake): I've acted as characters in shows where I didnt have to change much
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye, i just mean in general xD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m comfortable as Pyrrha but not because I know I can act as her but because I’m so proud of that stupid fucking costume and because wearing her makes me feel confident as fuck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like for me its yang
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that’s how Winter is
Halim (Greg) (jake): Specifically algernon from the importance of being ernest
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And Neo I just feel good in despite the hip squish
Georgia (Something Sensible): I can do Volume 1-3 Yang pretty well cause she’s a meme-y lesbian but after the feels. I can’t relate
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’ve always been really comfortable in 02 because she’s the character I’ve connected with most on a personal level but I’ve only worn her twice so idk
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Pyrrha felt good cause I got compliments on my corset and I’m like “WAT”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah Pyrrha is a power cosplay
Jess (whoozica): I only cosplayed v for like 10 seconds but i feel pretty good in him
Georgia (Something Sensible): People see that you’re already suffering with the corset and leg armor and decide they can’t mess with you
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I worked hard on outfit
God bless Meghan for saving me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): On the armor
Jess (whoozica): "im shy and artsy, plz dont yell at me"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Time to do my own for next time
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YOU GOTS THIS GURL
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *meanwhile, a slight tap on the shoulder and she falls over*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): IM@EXCORED BUT SCARED BUT BLESS BASED ERIK FOR WORBLA
Georgia (Something Sensible): FALSE I could do a cartwheel in my version 2 corset
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I can’t do a cartwheel at all TTuTT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Someone teach me XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Cartwheels in cosplay is fun 😊
Georgia (Something Sensible): _that is the only thing I maintained from 3 years of gymnastics_
Georgia (Something Sensible): And jumping on trampolines lmaooo
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): GIRL I GOT YOU I CAN TEACH YOU
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna learn how to do cartwheels so I can be Neo proper

PLEASE
Halim (Greg) (jake): Meghan is going to teach us all how to gymnastic
Jess (whoozica): i cant say i identify wholly with one character, its more like i play up one aspect of my self for a charcter, but that seems to teach me more about myself
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i took gymnastics for 3 years too xD THE ONLY THING I CAN STILL DO THOUGH is one of those easy as fuck bar flippy things
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s the one thing I hate about myself is im clumsy
Jess (whoozica): oh me too gurl it ok
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i cant even do a cartwheel anymore
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I did gymnastics for 15 yrs and while I don’t have much to show for it I don’t regret any of it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its FUUUUUUUN
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i regret quitting
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yo I’d take classes if they had so@e
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’d like to get more flexible
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like maybe it would help me tone
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Just know if you put your child in competitive gymnastics they WILL come out with a fucked up body and a fucked up emotional state 👏🏻
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m letting my child do what they want

Since my child is a fuzzy child with toebeans
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I love toebeans
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She’s already a gymnast at age 16
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I bet she’s doing great
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She’s a little wobbly but she’s still pretty great
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shes doing her best
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She really is
Halim (Greg) (jake): What a mood
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): My little cousin is 8 and they have her on the Olympic track. She’s got potential but at the same time I’m like RIP her emotional state
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And her back
Mark (Mad Doctor): Coat for Gen:Lock arrived.  Asian sizes make me feel so damn fat. This is snug on me and it's a 3XL (I wear XL in American)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it looks good though! what character is this for?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the david tenant one? ~~i forget which ones which~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): The Doctor, voiced by David Tennant, and pretty much based on him. He's the recruiter/trainer for the young heroes. I saw him in two of the trailers and fell in love
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The show hasn't even come out yet and I already want to cosplay the one girl xD i can't remember her name or anything though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): when does the show come out? xD
Mark (Mad Doctor): January
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im a little behind on this
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thank you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The blonde girl! That's the one I wanted to be from the preview I saw lol. She seems cute
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the one with the bunny ears?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Looks easy enough, even for a close like me.  <@169297844874903552> Audrey loves her, too. She's voiced by Maisie Williams
Evie (Katheryne Knight): NOICE
you want fucking rwby chibi?: personally i kinda enjoy being held to the standard of "wow you really are [character i cosplay]!" bc it makes me v happy but thats not gonna stop me from saying fuck In cosplay lmao
(probs bc i typically identify with a majority of chars i cosplay but hey ☆)
Jess (whoozica): I think it can depend on how the person says it too
Mark (Mad Doctor): If I couldn't say fuck in cosplay...I'd be stuck cosplaying Neo.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep I’m fine with it usually cause people usually use it as “wow I really embrace the character well.” 

I think I’ve had t said to me in a negative light once but I brush it off
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Most people I’ve met in person usually don’t give me issues. It’s on the internet issues arise
Matt (mattmyers25): Head piece for hiro is done by a friend
Evie (Katheryne Knight): NICE
