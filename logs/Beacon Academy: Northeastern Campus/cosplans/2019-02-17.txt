Mark (Mad Doctor): <@334090409389195266> I used this stuff to adhere my eyepatch. It's surgical glue apparently. Needs to cure 10 minutes like contact cement, but no fumes (important for masks and eyepatches) and it held all night. A little pricey but I think my little bottle will last for years
Anna (loud and likely blonde): How easy is it to remove? I now have a terrible relationship with spirit gum
Mark (Mad Doctor): Came off with cold water. And I still have both eyebrows
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Ohhhhhh EXCELLENT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OHH I better purchase some of that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Thank you <@386567060026556417>
