Marisa (Weeb): remember when craft foam was like $0.30 cents apiece at walmart
and now it's like $500 for 2 sheets online
is this because of cosplay inflation
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You can get a 40 x 60in role of craft foam at Micheals for 8.99$
Marisa (Weeb): omg really?? that is good.
i need a math textbook
is that still good savings compared to driving around to every walmart and buying 40x60" equivalent of tiny paper-sized foam sheets
Erik (Red Riot Thot): how much are the paper-sized foam sheet?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You can use Coupons on it so I’ll usually wait until I have a couple 50% off joann coupons (micheals also takes competitors coupons) and I’ll get a couple of roles at ounce
Marisa (Weeb): paper-sized foam sheets are pretty cheap, like less than a dollar each usually, but they're hard to find
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah I'd say go for the roll
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It’s usually 50¢ per 8 1/2 x 14 piece
Erik (Red Riot Thot): then you're able to cut longer pieces as needed
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Idk of the price is all that different but I get it so that my foamwork doesn’t have seams
Marisa (Weeb): yeah that's convenient. i mostly use foam for really small stuff so the paper sized ones work but it's a pain finding them
Marisa (Weeb): and there's a lot of waste
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Every Micheals and joanns has craft foam
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It’s not a popular material so it’s often hidden but they always have it
Marisa (Weeb): jo-ann's foam expensive ; A ;
Marisa (Weeb): i can't find the big roll on michaels' website but they have decent prices for unpopular colors
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.michaels.com/black-foam-roll-by-creatology/10466090.html
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Might not be the same because I remember it being the price Meg mentioned
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’ve never bought it online but in the store it’s usually on the shelf above the craft foam squares
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ☝
Marisa (Weeb): i'm laughing the picture on that link looks so tiny
Marisa (Weeb): it's like a dog toy
