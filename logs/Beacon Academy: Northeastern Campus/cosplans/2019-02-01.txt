Georgia (Something Sensible): this hero suit dropped down 10 dollars in price this week üëÄ
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i rlly want one tho~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *goes to gym in said outfit*
Jamie (Jamie): Tmw pins decide you should make literal the statement made with *blood* sweat and tears and your working with white fabric
Jess (whoozica): üò≠
Jamie (Jamie): ~~i saved the fabric before it could be a problem luckily~~
Jamie (Jamie): But also ouch
Jess (whoozica): That was almost me last night too
Anna (loud and likely blonde): hydrogen peroxide takes out the blood btw
Jamie (Jamie): Good to know
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~dont judge me i was very accident prone when i was on track~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): still got scars from my shoes rip.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): basically as long as you dont wash it with hot water or dry it with heat you can get blood out. 
if u do heat it like cooks the little hemoglobins or something.
Jess (whoozica): ~~i mean I know that cuz I got tired of ruining undies~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): honestly the hydrogen peroxide never helped undies for me
Jess (whoozica): Yo really?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah i just. say fuck it and throw em in the wash
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~no one lookin at em so idc~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh!!! also uhhhhh what is it. i think baking soda vinegar can help get out blood from fabric if its being particularly stubborn
Jess (whoozica): Yea baking soda and vinegar is good for alot of stuff
Jess (whoozica): We use to get baked on food of off dinnerware
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Casey posted this and like, I so relate but also can‚Äôt tell how I feel
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I totally stand by paying photographers for their skills but I hate when photographers message me like ‚Äúhey look at what we could do!‚Äù and try to set it all up before telling me rates
Anna (loud and likely blonde): it basically boils down to etiquitte
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like. down for paying ppl for their skills 100% as any rational person is. but like someone commented on fb saying that if you approach someone like that you should probably say that you were "wondering if we could shoot and if you're interested we can discuss rates"
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like to be more up front with it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: think about it this way
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: how would you feel if somebody asked if you'd like to meet up and do something you both enjoy
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: then immidiately went ok so heres how you can pay me for it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah its totally a communication thing. 
and it makes you feel shitty for saying no (as the cosplayer)
Jess (whoozica): You guys can hang out with me for $10 an hour
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel that if a photographer expresses interest in doing a shoot with you, they should say "Hey, I would love to do a shoot with you. These are my rates, let me know if you're interested" or "These are my normal rates, but if you are short on cash, we can discuss pricing".
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But typically it should be the cosplayer seeking out the photographer
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ^^^
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i mean if you're a photog looking for work i dont see why you cant approach ppl and ask if you're clear. or, 'do you know anyone who is looking for photographers for XYZ con i still have space, here's my rates and a link to my portfolio'
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or the photographer seeking general clients, not specifically targeting certain people
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: theres nothing wrong with approaching people
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like it's important to be upfront about rates
Anna (loud and likely blonde): absolutely
Jess (whoozica): yea theres nothing wrong with marketing yourself you just need to be upfront
Mark (Mad Doctor): It is. The original message to Casey was ambiguous. A reasonable person would not assume they were selling services
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That like asking "Hey do you want my car?" "Yeah sure" "Great, it's $5000"
Jess (whoozica): "Ill take you out for dinner"
*at dinner*
"you pay"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ^
Jamie (Jamie): Finally some progress i can feel good about woot
Jamie (Jamie): 
Jess (whoozica): pretty!
Jamie (Jamie): Fun fact none of this is finished like its all partially donw even skirt still needs closed off and zippered
Jess (whoozica): thats fine
Jess (whoozica): just stand agaisnt a wall all day
Jamie (Jamie): And thank ovo

Jamie (Jamie): Thaaank its long time cosplan of nostaglia

Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I doubt Casey has to pay for shoots much.
Jamie (Jamie): Anyone else feel that love hate relationship with sewing one sleeves?
Jamie (Jamie): <:imdyingsquirtle:378261448838610944>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): yeet
Jess (whoozica): Just hate
