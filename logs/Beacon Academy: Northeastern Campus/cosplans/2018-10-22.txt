Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What I described was basting
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I have no idea what easing is
Jess (whoozica): Ok. I'mma wing it!
Georgia (Something Sensible): what kinda garment you sewing?
Jess (whoozica): Like just a regular Japanese school uniform
Jess (whoozica): No poofy sleeve
Georgia (Something Sensible): hmmm i guess a regular stitch would prob suffice
Jess (whoozica): 👌
Erik (slendergiant): I thought basting was when you poured meat juice over meat while it's cooking 🤔
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): .... maybe it is
Erik (slendergiant): But it absolutely is also what you described as well. I'm just being an ass 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH OK GOOD BECAYSE I WAS DOUBTING MYSELF LMAO
Marisa (Weeb): oo an ease stitch is to make stuff curvier/more fitting without darts. u basically sew an area and slightly gather it by tugging on the thread, and then sew the area next to that flat. like poofy sleeves but on a way smaller scale
Jess (whoozica): 😮 oooo that makes sense
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yoo it's looking really good so far!! 🤗
