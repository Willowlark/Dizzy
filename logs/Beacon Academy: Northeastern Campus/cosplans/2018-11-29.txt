Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It looks good!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): good dead mom
Erik (Red Riot Thot): New mask!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): ooooh!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YAAAAASS ERIK
Jess (whoozica): YEET look gud
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Yassss
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): *casually looks for stuff for a Jinn cosplay before finishing her Katsucon cosplays*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I slept on it and I hate my cape and I‚Äôm gonna remake it before Katsu OwO

I‚Äôm just gonna wait until A.) I move in and B.) I have money for fabric
Jamie (Jamie): Do we have a sat rwby meet up going sat of katsu? Someone was asking if one existed yet
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I think Saturday rwby shoot is supposed to be the Katsu official, which isn't announced.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I know Georgia/Jess/Tom/Marisa have no RWBY in their lineups saturday too.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same
Marisa (Weeb): ye katsu has that bad habit of not releasing their official photoshoot schedule until they release the whole schedule.
I don't think i'm gonna RWBY at all for Katsu because I'm trying this weird new thing where I wear season-appropriate costumes (no more sweltering hot fur outfits in the middle of summer or swimsuits in winter, freaky) and Ruby's the only good winter rwby outfit I have but I already wore her at katsucon once
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *once*
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Because when you do 9+ *(plus!)* costumes a con you also can't repeat any.
Marisa (Weeb): ya i have a thing about wearing costumes to a con i've already worn them to idk why <:lenny:456549338026344489>
it's pretty awful i should stop it *but i have too many new costumes to stop now*
Marisa (Weeb): i can't wait to start making stuff again i'm very excited for katarina and ray
Marisa (Weeb): japanese secondhand stores are great for costumes and would probably even be worth using a shipping proxy for when back in the US
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~don't mind me, just bragging on your behalf of your insane cosplay talents
Marisa (Weeb): what talents
i can bend my fingers pretty far back
Marisa (Weeb): i think 5 costumes is a little excessive for friday though i might need to rethink it
Marisa (Weeb): wait it's 4 now i forgot maki was moved to thursday we good
Rebecca (madameterralupus): .~. I dunno if imma do Denki for KonKon cause time but I still wanna do BNHA and idk what to do D:
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): deku
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): do you have any christmas-y stuff that you could wear?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cause you could potentially do any character
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have wigs for Deku and Aizawa. Maybe others. I'd have to look. As for clothes I'm sure I have something but would still need to buy stuff... I just worry I won't have time to decorate the onsie I was planning on getting cause it won't be here till Sunday/Monday if I get it üòÖ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ you did whip together a gym uniform in like record breaking time~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Konkon is short for KonKrunch.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lmao you right but next week is the week before finals so oof~~
snow ( karma chameleon ): my Christmas outfit for froppy came in I‚Äôm pretty much set for konkon. I‚Äôm not doing any rwby to katsu I think .-.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Froppy needs extra bundles of layers or otherwise she'll go into hibernation mode
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hm. I have a last minute non-BNHA Old Guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Cosplay for KonKon. Now I need to make it Holiday-ish
snow ( karma chameleon ): hibernation mode sounds delightful after my seven day work week
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I'm so excited to see how christmasy everyone is gonna be
