Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also I’m highly tempted to purchase my Toga cosplay with this paycheck
Tom (tomukuncosplay): What's your power?
**IGETHARD**

I’m gonna be swamped but it would be nice to be comfortable at some point XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): What’s your line up look like now?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So far, Summer Rose, Neo 3.0, Winter, Ann Takamaki
ZombieHunter: more shoots more shoots more shoots
ZombieHunter: >:)
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Summer with my STRQ group, Neo 3.0 hopefully for the 3.0 group, Winter because I can’t not be her, and Chris and I wanna do Ann and Ryuji 
I kinda wanna do Ochako in the evenings because she’s comfy.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Idk if Chris is getting Deku together XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~I hope he at least does the school uniform~~
Marisa (Weeb): there's a bnha pj party right? might bring tsuyu and try PJ that if my wig is intact
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof might try and do PJ Ochako or PJ Toga
Evie (Katheryne Knight): omg I already have cute ideas for Ochako
Marisa (Weeb): who goin to zenkaikon
Marisa (Weeb): same people as katsu?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'll be at Zenkai since I am local lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): almost everyone.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Zenkai and Katsu are our big ones.
Marisa (Weeb): i think i have more solid plans for zenkai than katsu atm
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep I’ll be at Zenkai
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yo saaame
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Zenkai besides maybe Ruby or Pyrrha is gonna be Villains con XD
Marisa (Weeb): i'll be staffing and i think i'm going to be assigned security, so i need my staff shirt visible while cosplaying.
so I think i have 3 costumes for all 3 days of staffing. natsumi from sgt frog (gonna have the frogs hanging from my arms and legs like scared children), jaehee from mystic mess (if the t-shirt looks decent under the suit if not i'll scrap this idea), and possibly holo from spice and wolf/selkie from fire emblem (or anything i can stick a tail and ears onto).
Marisa (Weeb): or a maid with a waist apron tied over the shirt
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I know I’m bringing Neo (3.0 or regular), MAYBE Larxene from KH, Ruby Rose, Winter, and Toga
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ...Do I need to start planning for Katsu already...?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh speaking of planning anyone wanna do a League if Villains cosplay with Chris and I? We’re gonna be Shigaraki and Toga so we need basically everyone else.
Marisa (Weeb): ~~I wanna do la brava but am too big and she isn’t a league member hnn~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~do it anyway~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wouldn't miss Zenkai for anything
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Saaaame
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shit it’s where Chris and I first met basically when we were just friends
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I won’t miss Katsu either cause ya out anniversary con.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Two cons I could never miss are katsu and zenkai

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i love katsu, but its stressful as fuck
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We almost did Mag this year, but decided to go with the one everyone's going to.
snow ( karma chameleon ): U damn skippy it is
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If it was just photos you can do it at Mag, but miss out on everyone? That'd be sucky.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Colossal is a magical place where nerds all drink, get confident, and just enjoy being. In hot tubs, half naked, kinda drunk.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That... admittedly sounds *terrible*, but it's magic.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): i need to go to a colossal
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It does sound like magic
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Though me drunk is one hell of a ride
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont think ive ever worn less in public and not cared, colossal surely is a magical place
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): right?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I had a whole glass of sake over the weekend in DC and that shit hits hard thank god we took the subway
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I feel great and then the crash happens
