Mark (Mad Doctor): Finished my first pieces of Iron Man armor. Could be better. A lot better. The paint is chipping like crazy over the seams. I don't think PlastiDip bonds very well over silicone. Oh, well. In miniatures painting, we have a "three foot" rule: if your mini looks good from three feet away, it's good. I'll apply the same standard to cosplay, only scaling it up to thirty feet.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Hmm could try bullseye shellac spray finisher too
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was thinking of something like that. I'm a little worried that a finish might dull the cool metallic shine I have now
Tom (tomukuncosplay): The shellac seems to be decent in my experience at least
Tom (tomukuncosplay): It's shiny
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thanks for the info. I'll give it a try
