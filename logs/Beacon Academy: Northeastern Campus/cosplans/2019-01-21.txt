Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thanks guys >\\\\\<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay bad idea time

I wanna do Team CRME as KDA XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): +Neo
Erik (Red Riot Thot): New spaulder, new vambrace, new shirt

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yasss! It's looking good so far! ðŸ˜„
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thanks!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Very classy <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yooooooooo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): You did amazing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That shine the collar and trim has really makes it pop
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I'm hoping the blue contacts from Honeycolor get here soon. As of a week ago they were still in Malaysia and haven't had any updates since so probably being held up in customs again lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I love the shine
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Once it's all done you should do a "glow up" side by side
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's a deeper burgundy than I would have liked (it looks more like his V3 model here) but I couldn't find anything that was more V4 color accurate and still have a contrasting texture
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I plan to!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): IT LOOKS SO GOOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Sometimes things look better when they're not 100%screen accurate
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And with the bandana, there's really no need to redo it other than I want a less bright red
Anna (Cadmium): Someone remind me to just. Use stencils next time
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Looks great though
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh that looks awesome!
Anna (Cadmium): Thank.
