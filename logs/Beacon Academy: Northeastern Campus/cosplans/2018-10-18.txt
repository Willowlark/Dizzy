Erik (slendergiant): Unless it has to be the 18th in Rooster Teeth Land aka Austin, TX
Erik (slendergiant): In which case I'll take a nap and wake up in an hour
Marisa (Weeb): they wait for the last possible time zone to hit the 18th
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Might possibly be the case

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): has anyone worked with chiffon? is it a pain in the ass?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): for context: Im trying to decide if i want to do an art nouveau Star Butterfly (wing form) or if i want to just stick to the cartoony look for it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO that'd be really pretty!!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEA, like hannah alexander inspired
Marisa (Weeb): Chiffon sucks but go for it. Itâ€™s better than satin
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WELP that was my next question, SO i guess CHIFFON IT IS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it can't be worse than velvet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): can it?
Marisa (Weeb): Ohohoho satin is the worst
Marisa (Weeb): Satan
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Marisa (Weeb): Frays like no tomorrow
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cause its slippery? or is it the fraying? cause like THE FALLOUT OF VELVET MADE ME WANT TO DIE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh fraying YE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fraying is the devil
Marisa (Weeb): Oh yeah the slippery ness too heh. Also the shiny kind makes for awful photos
Marisa (Weeb): Also poking holes in satin accidentally can mess up the whole thing bluh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i just realized, the first cosplay i ever made was a satin lolita chobits dress
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ..maybe thats why i have the patience of a saint when it comes to sewing
Jess (whoozica): on of the first things i made was satin too and oof yea pics are bad
Marisa (Weeb): let me be with yooooooooooou
Marisa (Weeb): i'm going to be singing that all night now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): surprisingly the chobits dress wasn't awful in pics
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was shiny as fuck though so i dont know HOW
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Chiffon SUCKS BUT ITS SO NICE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I recommend cutting it with Pinking Sheers yo reduce fray as much as possible
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh shit, good rec
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i forgot to get a pair of those. I should do that before i forget
Jess (whoozica): ðŸ˜® whats pinking sheers?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay so Pinking Sheers are good to cut fabrics that are fray
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they look like those fancy scrapbooking scissors
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that cut like zigzags
Jess (whoozica): OHH i think i have those
Jess (whoozica): when we moved in there was sewing supplies in the house I didnt sew at the time though so i got rid of alot
Jess (whoozica): there was like 2 decent sized boxes of clothing patterns that i got rid of and boy do i regret that

Erik (slendergiant): Something I aspire to get on his level with ðŸ˜‚
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Little red riot hood is you dipping your toes in
Erik (slendergiant): No, that's trial by fire
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Look wading in gives you enough time to back out
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Just dive in head first
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Itâ€™s more fun that way

Matt (mattmyers25): !lewd

Jess (whoozica): literally everyone elses PJs are cute af
Jess (whoozica): OOOO tough decsison
Jess (whoozica): id say, if you have enough other "pyrrha" stuff then red
Erik (slendergiant): Rooster Teeth: "Pyrrha's dead. No one cares about her anymore and *we* surely don't..."
FNDM: "WE FUCKING DO"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed with Jess. Also red colored eyes are more vampirey lol
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Red contacts are better for the Vampire effect
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Iâ€™ll prob bring both and see witch I like better
Erik (slendergiant): *witch*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Iâ€™m in concrunch my spelling doesnâ€™t count
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh frens I need an opinion! 
So, do you think sheâ€™s wearing white pants, or black. Knee-thigh high boots or low boots? 
Cause if Iâ€™m not gonna get 3.0 Winter at some point soon Iâ€™m just gonna guess
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd say white pants, knee/thigh boots
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): White pants definitely
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Boots probably have some high tech armor
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Bach does seem to have a thing for robo legs.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think white pants would look better, but going off of weiss' design, if they match winter would have black pants
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Black would make Winter look more spec ops than leadership. Depends on the mood you want.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I say white pants
