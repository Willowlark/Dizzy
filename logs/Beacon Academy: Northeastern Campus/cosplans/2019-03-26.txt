Rebecca (madameterralupus): These deal with it glasses... I fucking can't 😂😂 I need to get my own pair now
Mark (Mad Doctor): That was one of the nicer Adams I've met, and we kept dragging the poor dear out to be abused by bumblebees
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ye they were pretty chill. RIP them though us murdering them any time Blakes were there XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i feel that. that adam. knew exactly what they were walking into with a rwby shoot dressed as adam with the face brand
Anna (loud and likely blonde): where can i look at all these lovely pictures of my friens at the rwby shoot idk where they were posted
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): zenkai rwby event on fb
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Someone yelled a negative remark during the solo Adam call and I got annoyed with that.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): aww :c no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): leave them alone
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Adam terrible yes but the cosplayer is not.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hope saying “no negative remarks” isn’t a requirement going forward.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they were really nice and just there for the fun of it. don't associate the cosplayer with the character
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ugh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's a mega yikes. I didn't hear that but that's really shitty.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): But yea agreed dont associate cosplayer with chara
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like geez
Mark (Mad Doctor): Eh, when I did Jacques I kind of expected it. I certainly didn't take negativity personally
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~like what if we dress specifically as the villain in order to take pictures of the hero's killing us like~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee but sadly some people could let it affect them.
Matt (mattmyers25): I experienced that as Qrow at Katsu
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeeee.... it wasn’t like a wave a comments thank god.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): :/ wtf were people saying to you at katsu
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You did Matt? >.>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wtf where was I.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Vic related?
Matt (mattmyers25): You were next to me
Matt (mattmyers25): And yes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh I remember now.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wtf
Mark (Mad Doctor): I saw a Qrow cosplayer with a sign that read "My VA is a dick" to stay ahead of those comments
Rebecca (madameterralupus): But that wasn't all that bad. He just kidna came up and started talking about hwo oh your chara's VA is gone as wel kept walking and ignored ~~cause i didnt wanna get in drama~~  He wasnt really saying your chara or you is abd cause of that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And yeee I saw that with a Tamaki too.
Matt (mattmyers25): True but someone later on said something to me. It was before my night shoot on Friday
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ah I wasnt there then
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That poor Adam cosplayer. That's why they kinda seemed so distant. I complimented their cosplay, and they seemed timid?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~someone get that Adam a con parent stat~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That may be why they didn't hang with the rest of the group 

They seemed quiet but this seemed like a sad sort of thing
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like it wasn't the sort of "I'm introverted" quiet
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm I was gonna try to chat to them but I didnt know where they were sometimes when back in the hole waiting to go out for pics
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 😥
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea they kinda stood on the side away from everyone
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i felt kinda bad cause it seemed like everyone was blowing them off simply because ADAM
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which shitty
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~we need to assimilate them into friendship~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i complimented their cosplay as i passed by
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but like you said they kind were timid/sad
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I tried smiling at them whenever I could because they seemed a bit awkward. Not sure if Salem smiling scared them away or not XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee I kinda regret my own personal shy-ness cause I saw them around the con most of the day and thought they looked really good as Adam, also thought their makeup was good but I always get too shy to talk to people I don't know. I never know how they'll react so I just stay quiet and then regret it later >.<
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~we need a "you tried" star emoji~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): sameee social anxiety ftw
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *billiam*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we need u
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah I complimented her scar while she was up.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gotta watch out for any Adam's in the future. ~~Even if the vast majority of Adam cosplayers in the past were lowkey creepy~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But that was the person, not the cosplay.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also like that scar takes serious effort to make happen?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd love to shoot a unmasked Adam just for those close ups.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Deff. I want to try to do it at some point but it intimidates me so much.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So like mega props to that Adam cosplyer cause that makeup looked hella nice
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There was one at Katsu who was litty too.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My roommate wants to do Adam and have the scar
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yesss
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> Why is shipping on things so damned expensive... I went to buy a pair or Adam horns Ive been looking at so I have them for CCE... and the shipping is $20. Holy shiittt
Anna (loud and likely blonde): F

Rebecca (madameterralupus): They were 3d printed ones
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we have a hunter
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but also like ill make u some if u want i wanna try some new foam making techniques
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like they weren't badly priced until I saw shipping and I was like lol noopppee too much XD

Anna (loud and likely blonde): if u want foams
Anna (loud and likely blonde): or if u wanna try the 3d modeling
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I may hit ya up if I can't figure something out lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Chris could have printed them for much cheaper! I'm sure he would have done it for you!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I haven't bought them XD I may see what I can make them out of at home. If I can't figure something out I may hit him up OwO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): BNE is slowly accumulating cosplay machinery. It appears we now have 2 ppl with 3d printers in their midsts.... eventually I will own an embroidery machine. i swear. 
Erik has power tools it seems.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): someone needs to get a cricut
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i might get one
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ive been thinking about it for like 2 years
Anna (loud and likely blonde): OwO

Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): <@334090409389195266> I feel you, cutting the htv for Kali by hand was awful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): right? Big Nope Energy
Marisa (Mawisa): i have like 15 embroidery machines
Marisa (Mawisa): but they old
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Just shakey ass hands with an xacto blade for eternity. Might be worth the $300/$400 investment in a cricut
Marisa (Mawisa): the installation for the software to run the embroidery machines i have are on floppy disks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): omg
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~my friend had to order a desktop computer for her machine~~ but like.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i just used a computer with a mouse that had a ball in it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): mawisa u gotta. be the embroidery gal
Marisa (Mawisa): i'll combine all the machines into one giant voltron machine
Anna (loud and likely blonde): if bne supply file and coin can u print
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I'll be the wood gal since we have a bunch of saws and sanders for wood XD~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): YEET
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea i have no room for sanding stuff like wood
Marisa (Mawisa): mmmmmmaybe 🤔 i don't have a computer with a floppy disk drive but maybe i can find the software online on their website or somethin
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u can just get an external floppy disk drive i think
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but you might either have the files online
Anna (loud and likely blonde): or you have to accept u need a dinosaur of a computer
Marisa (Mawisa): woah those exist <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): sorry we already got rid of ours
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea i would give you ours but it was scuzzy ports so
Marisa (Mawisa): i couldn't accept such a gift tis too much
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~it was purple~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have a scroll saw and a drill. That's the extent of my power tools lol
Marisa (Mawisa): ah, a girl of gaming, i see
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if i could get my brother into cosplay he has a whole workshop with tools and shit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but he doesnt give a fuck about cosplay unless im making it for him ~~RIP~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My dad has a radial arm saw, jigsaw, and a power sander
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I also have 3D modeling software if you hit someone else up to print for you
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i have. 
Knives.

Anna (loud and likely blonde): anyone got a serger

Anna (loud and likely blonde): 0w0
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it big pain in the ass to use NGL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but it handy
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i mean arent all sergers
Anna (loud and likely blonde): thread snapping is a curse
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): rethreading is hell
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like you better be satisfied with using the same color thread for everything
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fucking yikes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): honestly. my mom taught me
Anna (loud and likely blonde): just snip the thread and tie it to the next color
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and pull it through
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): heck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nless you
Anna (loud and likely blonde): did i just teach a thing??
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes you did
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yesssssss
Anna (loud and likely blonde): less suffering
Marisa (Mawisa): i get so confused when switching machines because on a sewing machine you can't sew nothing and you can just pull the threads through but on a serger you have to sew nothing or there won't be enough thread and it'll get unthreaded when you start serging again
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh thats a mood, i often forget
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and then im like FUcK
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~get urself a sad machine where it wants to sew nothing
Anna (loud and likely blonde): has anyone tried this
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no but im going to for bills mirio wig

Anna (loud and likely blonde): ummmmmm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): without spemding like a fuckton of moneys
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i had an idea
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but it was while not sober so idk if its a good idea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lets hear it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): well it started with buying shitty lacefront wigs off amazon and cutting up 2 of them to be able to fit my head but idk how bills head fits in normal wigs
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like if its too big or nah
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but basically i was gonna. fake a hairline. via fake ventillating
Anna (loud and likely blonde): aka glue to mesh
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and then sew mesh to wig
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and then add to entire hairline
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think you like killing yourself too much
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): masochistic almost
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i crave death every moment
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i can tell
Anna (loud and likely blonde): thank
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i try to keep the aura ominous
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but also i was gonna try to avoid actually ventillating at all costs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats a fucking mood
Anna (loud and likely blonde): basically if the hairline is wrong. some weft. and sewing them in backwards like ponytail wig
Anna (loud and likely blonde): or we could just bleach bill's hair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): bill its time to go blonde
Anna (loud and likely blonde): hes a guy it grows fast
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~BILL GO BLONDE WITH ME~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Whoops caps
Anna (loud and likely blonde): OH i remember. i was gonna make a foam version of the banana
Anna (loud and likely blonde): basically like. so its perma attached to wog
Marisa (Mawisa): o i've done that for a hairline on a cheap wig. is good idea
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’d be a terrible blonde. There was a bit a year ago or something about Georgia turning everyone blonde too.
Marisa (Mawisa): i'm an atrocious blonde u saw how i looked in terra. but u can do it 🌟 u can pull it off. we'll color ur eyebrows
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You looked beautiful as Terra Baka.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): join the hoard of blondes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): <@!334090409389195266> honestly i have an amazon lacefront that i do not like thats pretty much platinum if u wanna try to make bill into a blonde bae
Anna (loud and likely blonde): my head. barely fits in it with my hair down.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof its super small?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe not, but i appreciate the offer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im prob gonna start with a rufio from arda and do a glued hairline
Marisa (Mawisa): i got them roma genes so can't pull off blonde

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean valid
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i basically only buy amazon wigs so mood
