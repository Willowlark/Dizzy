Erik (slendergiant): Yes
Marisa (Weeb): thank u for your input it will be highly considered
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Why not both ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è lol
Marisa (Weeb): 6 months ago i said "I'll only need 2 or 3 cosplays maybe since i'm here temporarily"

Marisa (Weeb): 11 here in japan i have like ten billion at home
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Both
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Better yet, all 3

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm wondering if they'd be okay with a Jock!Qrow
Evie (Katheryne Knight): In reference to the cheer grou because I'm WAY far behind on this chat XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): I can totally see Qrow in a varsity letter sweater. I'd call him Bro Qrow
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I was gonna get a custom jacket with ‚ÄúTEAM STRQ‚Äù on the back with the beacon emblem on it somewhere
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Qrow would have to not be drunk at practice to get a varsity letter.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The man can fight dangerously well when I inebriated I don‚Äôt wanna know how he fights sober
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Hey, at least it's not steroids...yeah, I'm looking at you, Hazel"
Erik (slendergiant): Ooh varsity jackets with their initial as the letter! That would be awesome!
Marisa (Weeb): ye i think a varsity jacket suits qrow better than a varsity sweater
