Georgia (Something Sensible): OG PYRRHA THO WHAT A BEAUT

Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think I like Pyrrha's actual design better, but the original hair better
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh i like the rivet detail on her armor
Erik (Red Riot Thot): also
Georgia (Something Sensible): We deserved Pyrrha with her hair down dammit
Georgia (Something Sensible): Her old design looks more futuristic
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~is this just gonna be accidental OG design group~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I like how Jaune's emblem is on her concept design  👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that emblem at the top looks like they tried to mash them together somehow
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~georgia do OG pyrrha~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): join us in suffering
Georgia (Something Sensible): My Starfire wig IS pretty versatile...
Georgia (Something Sensible): Curse these damn internships for not getting back to me
Georgia (Something Sensible): I need to know which state I’ll be in for the summer lmao
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause RTX would be fun, even if a lot of peeps aren’t going this year
Anna (loud and likely blonde): just means we gotta go next year too. 
Next year is the 10th RTX? I think?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i actually have a cherry red wig, long haired (mid upper back?) with bangs if u want it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Otakon not RTX~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~RTX isn't worth the vacation days compared to other cons~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): unfortunate i have already purchased RTX tix plus the liklihood of my bosses closing the office the friday after july 4th reduces the vacation days i need
Georgia (Something Sensible): If I go to NASA I can do boooooth assuming they give me two days off
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ill. go to otakon next year or something
Georgia (Something Sensible): A lot of the RTX peeps are going to japan this summer apparently
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lmfao i think i saw that
Georgia (Something Sensible): Vincent and then
Anna (loud and likely blonde): its like weeb birthright i suppose
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk if Chris and gen are on that train, but they also mentioned not going
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh or i can just. drive down friday night and do 2 days of otakon
Georgia (Something Sensible): I don’t think DE crew has mentioned anything about it?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah a lotta peeps ain’t goin
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~my father is gonna kill me im at 199K on this car already~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i need to stop trying to do all the days of a con and just go to weekend days
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~and stop making 3 new costumes each con~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): seems like an off year for RTX idk honestly a break is a good idea.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but also i never been to TX so im goin
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~only reason im prob going is to give arryn her robe~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and also i have points for free hotel and cheap flight
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~not to hang out with me?~~ jk but like nice cheap flight
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ofc to hang with you too~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): fuck how do i have my RTX lineup set ALREADY ITS MARCH
Mark (Mad Doctor): I don't even have my Zenkai lineup set...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't feel as bad now feeling like I took forever figuring out my Zenkai line up since at least 2 of ya have no clue what wearing yet XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Part of it is the people running the Marvel shoot still haven't picked a time.  They're hoping that a perfect time and place will appear  that they can use.  Right now, they're trudging towards Saturday at 2:00, when RWBY, Star Wars, and one other big shoot are happening.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof D:
Anna (loud and likely blonde): amazing. 
So anyways if i deviate or add to my lineup of Grimm Yang, GB Ironwood, and OG Yang, someone hit me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh ye! I did the velcro on the collar of my Deku jacket to attach the mask/hood and aayyy it works! 🙌
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So far Zenkai is Toga and Winter. 

Idk who to do for Sunday...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My poor Summer cape got a horrid stain on it that won't come out no matter how much oxy clean I use so I need to make a new cape before wearing her again.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh no where and pics :-:
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It's on the back at the very bottom 

I'll picks when I get home ^^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also I want to remake it out if a softer, less wrinkly material
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So it's not a huge loss
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u might be able to just shorten it if its at the bottom otherwise lemme see what weird methods ive used to get stains out  
or at least save the red lining for onw
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Actually....
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shortening the bottom might not be a bad idea
Anna (loud and likely blonde): less tripping hazard lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and hemming it a lil shorter for now means u can wear her to zenkai
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Id literally be cutting like... An inch or two off so it's not that bad
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also less to iron because L O R D
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cotton can suck my ass
Anna (loud and likely blonde): mood
Anna (loud and likely blonde): honestly i need to just buy a $20 steamer
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You not doing castlevania for Zenkai?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Plans fell through. It's too tight right now and it didn't help that Zenkai was earlier this year 

My roommate is trying to finish Oscar's second outfit right now so she wasn't going to get Alucard done and Chris doesn't have the funds for Trevor
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Justified, Zenkai is way too soon this year.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like if it was in May this would be easier
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But I'm still coming down from Katsu
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I'm just gonna start on Otakon plans since I plan on pulling out Jeanne D'arc and a remake of Pyrrha
Evie (Katheryne Knight): RIP me XD
Marisa (Mawisa): Fate? OwO
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): So far Zenkai is just Salem 😂😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Salem con.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Gotta find that lamp*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Still surprised no one did moth salem
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I would but...it would be kinda weird
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Also I would need to make a lamp
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~or just have friends who happen to like prop making~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): hi
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~take one of ur old salem wigs and put the hair tentacles up front like antennae~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@301927856240459777> Yes OwO
