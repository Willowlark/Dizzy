Evie (Katheryne Knight): DID SOMEONE SAY VOLTRON
Marisa (Weeb): TWO DAYS TIL SEASON 6
Evie (Katheryne Knight): GET HYPE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): IM SO HYPE
Jess (whoozica): 🙌
Marisa (Weeb): before watching voltron: man why everyone cosplay pidge
after watching voltron *i wanna cosplay pidge*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): M E
Evie (Katheryne Knight): As I cosplay Allura
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Marisa (Weeb): some people are already cosplaying characters from the sneak preview trailer that were shown for like .2 seconds
Marisa (Weeb): YOOOOOOO
Jess (whoozica): ~~im still thinking about this damn lotor cosplay and how above my skill level it is~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I forgot the pink marks and I didn’t have my ears big fak it XD
Marisa (Weeb): u can do it do it do it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You got this!
Marisa (Weeb): if you're scared of the paint it's ok the homestucks shall help
Jess (whoozica): Nah that's the least of my worries 😂
Jess (whoozica): I'mma put it on my idea list but I'm not positive if I can swing it 😂
Marisa (Weeb): peer pressure
Marisa (Weeb): ~~do the old version of him~~
Marisa (Weeb): 
Jess (whoozica): Omg yas 😂
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): <@169297844874903552>  yeah it would be great if you could see if they have a black horse, make sure it'd be okay around smoke bombs lol and I think I'm just gonna make the human part since it doesn't have human legs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I shall see lol. I mean last I was told they have 4 horses so bound to hopefully have a black one XD
I'll keep ya updated lmfao
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 👌👌
you want fucking rwby chibi?: everymoby an their cousin wants to cosplay pidge its just a fact a life lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And I am sure if they do have one they'd let us use it but we'd prob have to shoot at their house lol. And I'd make them stay around to help keep it control just in case lol.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don’t think a horse is going to like smoke bombs.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Btw you can probably use horse chalk paint to do the grim parts unless you wanna just edit photos later on xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh that'd be smart 😮 I forgot about that stuff
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I used to do horse riding stuff and every year they had a costume contest where you had to dress up with your horse partner xD we used that paint stuff all the time. It looks really cool and shows up really nice on black horses!! So its definitely something to consider :3
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'll deff make a note of it in case the person I know does end up having a black horse lol. It'd make it easier too than having to edit in post lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea! Even if you still need to edit, it makes it much easier to follow a guideline!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I was gonna make bridle attachments for a more real look, and I don't really mean smoke *bombs* I just mean like something that emits smoke for a creepy effect, either ways it's up to whether they have the horse and whether it would be okay or not lol I'll go from there
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I shall try to ask this week lol. If I don't letya know by Saturday yell at me to ask XD
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): <@229713389511901185> voltron ♡♡♡
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Me: *Talking to person I know with horses* 
Them: What's  up??
Me: Oh nothing just cosplan talking.. BY THE WAY CAN WE BORROW YOUR HORSES?! XDDD 

** Jk jk I haven't asked yet
Matt (mattmyers25): Don't
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Why not?! XD
Matt (mattmyers25): I know things
Rebecca (madameterralupus): >.> *deep breath* BOI I SWEAR
Matt (mattmyers25): XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Mock up is a mess and needs tweaking
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It looks really good!! 😄
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But it’s a step forward ^_^
Thank you!
Georgia (Something Sensible): OOOO GOOD JOB
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THANK
It needs some heavy tweaking but that’s what a mock up is for ^_^
Mark (Mad Doctor): Fun fact: every cinematic Marvel hero spends 47% of their screen time in three-point stance
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://tenor.com/view/deadpool-superhero-landing-good-job-gif-5750552
Evie (Katheryne Knight): There was a whole vid Chris showed me that showed how impossible the 3 point landing is UNLESS you’re Iron Man really. It was super cool!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wish I remembered who did it
snow ( crescentbladed ): I’m gonna make everyone do it for the marvel meetup, prep ur knees
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But I’m Loki what do 
I ain’t no hero OwO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if we all fall down, we better get a photo of us all on the floor
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’ll just dab or Slav squat
Evie (Katheryne Knight): With the “OwO What’s This” hat on
Mark (Mad Doctor): If I fall down in armor, I'mma gonna be a helpless baby turtle on its back
snow ( crescentbladed ): SNAPS PICS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats hilarious and i hope we get photos of it ...~~ before helping you up of course~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Of course
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I may or may not help you. Depends on how Loki I feel XD
snow ( crescentbladed ): I don’t even know who’s coming to my meetup at thIS POINT
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s at Katsu rightv
snow ( crescentbladed ): yus!! It’ll be Friday ^^
Erik (slendergiant): <@!229713389511901185> was it this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u429Qgvoxw4
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think we need a film with slow motion badass walking
Evie (Katheryne Knight): What time? Or is that tentative? I wanna know so I can plan my stuff around it! 
<@!386874959009415170> YES
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have so much I plan on doing for Katsu RIP me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Saaaaameee
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like between Loki, Persona, and RWBY I’m gonna die
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And maybe Voltron
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Or whatever else my bf and I get into before Katsu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): katsu will kill us all
snow ( crescentbladed ): I’m hoping to make it official at 3 pm
snow ( crescentbladed ): ~~doesn’t even know where to stay but I’ll at least be there Friday~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!229713389511901185> are you... *low key* worried about it?
snow ( crescentbladed ): is that heimdall u got
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!184437198865563648> S H U S H
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also im thinkin is making Katsu a villains con
snow ( crescentbladed ): >:3 ohh?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah other than Winter I’m bringing Neo, debuting Loki, and I might try to do Cinder and Goro Akechi from Persona 5
snow ( crescentbladed ): YASSSS do it! Villains are so fun
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh shit I wanna do Pyrrha again as well heck 

Look save me from myself
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ya'll getting your Katsu plans settled and I still barely know what I'm doing for Colossal East in a few months 😂
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I might be going and I think I’m just gonna do Juvia, Yuno, and maybe Pyrrha. Winter is a given
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): GO.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm slowly starting to get a line up down... I'm thinking Genbent Sun Wukong, Swimsuit Raven Branwen, Junko Enoshima, Max (camp Camp) and not sure what else or if I'll add anything else 🤷🏻‍♀️
snow ( crescentbladed ): if I can go Imma roob to CE (‘:
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If I can’t do Yuno I might do Monika 
Swimsuit Winter might happen
snow ( crescentbladed ): _swimsuit winter should happen_
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m so self conscious aaaaaaaah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you lose that pretty quick at colossal.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Bweeeeeeh
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Something about the bars being in the hot tubs.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Erik (slendergiant): OWO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): or the bars on every corner of the con center.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): or the bars.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ÓwÒ
snow ( crescentbladed ): don’t forget the bars
Evie (Katheryne Knight): H e c k
Erik (slendergiant): https://orig00.deviantart.net/3baf/f/2017/064/3/9/owo_intensifies_by_rikadoh-db197ad.gif
snow ( crescentbladed ): we will support u, friends boost friends confidence
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Or, in the less alcoholic stand point, you're in a water park with 400 minimum other people in wigs and heavy makeup. You get the 'among friends' feel despite it being a water park.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Sounds like my kind of con
snow ( crescentbladed ): _vacation cooon_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I ain't pretty exactly a ball of confidence either, but I don't dread it for a reason. 😃
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just hate how bathing suits squish my flab and also I have shoulders that can kill a man that looks bulky compared to my more feminine body... so I’m nervous to dona bathing suit cosplay compared to my other friends
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (either only applies to ball of confidence, of course)
snow ( crescentbladed ): I have no confidence but I still wanna have fun and work on that oWO plus size cosplayer woes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Just get me from the leggy down
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): pisshaw. Winter schnee is badass no matter the outfit.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Winter Schnee is fine covering up XD
snow ( crescentbladed ): ^^^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): besides what if the bird is watching
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like 
E w XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I think he'll be quite happy to~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But make the base outfit more covered up. I'm just saying don't expect to not be in the water. I did that last year, it did not stick.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I want to do Mojojos design but that requires her hair being in the bun and I dont wanna ruin my wig
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also I’m gonna gym so I might not respond!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gotta get those Pyrrha Gains.
Mark (Mad Doctor): My own gym work is going to be neutralized in the coming week as I stuff my face to deal with the stress of visiting parents and in-laws
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly if I can gain a little more muscle by RTX I’ll be happy

Oof good luck there <@!386567060026556417>
Georgia (Something Sensible): DID SOMEONE SAY PYRRHA GAINS
Georgia (Something Sensible): speaking of colossal plans, I'll probably do Pyrrha and Ladybugswimsuit!Marinette
Georgia (Something Sensible): Not 100% sure about the other days
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'm gonna be making a penny swimsuit for CE 😄
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have every intention of seeing if we can nier it up again. ~~Not that I directly do anything for that but!~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also mavis from hotel transylvania xD, and 2B again ~~possibly yang too but we shall see~~
Erik (slendergiant): Taiyang, Goro, and maybe Blake?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Erik, you have too much bellabooty for that. The pools will run red with blood. xP
Erik (slendergiant): <:pewish:420824457918152704>
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~from nosebleeds or people trying to kill each other over the bellabooty~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats horrifying
Erik (slendergiant): yes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): is it not accurate.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Saturday is probably my RWBY day, I'll prob submit a photoshoot for that day if there isn't one already lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): right, I was going to tell you after the Next disaster taking over formally might be for the best.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah someone has an event for the colossal RWBY shoot but it's not like... maintained
Georgia (Something Sensible): GOSH Anext was a disaster
Georgia (Something Sensible): The worst is that we offered them to use the organized shoot list and they said no so they entirely skipped over characters 😤😤😤
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): preeeeeaching to the choir.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can't find the colossal one.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!386874959009415170> yess bring Genbent Blake! We can do Genbent Black Sun together 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's a serious undertaking. You must tame the bellabooty, so the pools remain blood free and clear for the rest of the con.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you will also have no support, as Neptune will be busy whistling awkwardly at the entrance trying to pass of his fear as forgetting his wristband into the park.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao xD
I'm really hoping <@!386624706612297729> can deff go and be Fem! Neptune with me for some sea monkey shenanigans
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): don't monkey around too much.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙊
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yes, cover mouth before puke. Already in the seamonkey spirit.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg xD
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean I don't wanna be a shoot-hoarding glutton
Georgia (Something Sensible): _but the shoots are bad_
Georgia (Something Sensible): _and people refuse to get help_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): link the shoot event for CCE, I want to see if it's the same girl as last year.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also didn't know what she was doing, but she was very open to advice and I helped her out.
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://www.facebook.com/events/1584917518302918/?ti=ia
Georgia (Something Sensible): It's listed as 6 pm
Georgia (Something Sensible): Which is weird
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'm marked interested already shit~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): everything is TBD.
Georgia (Something Sensible): It's listed for Friday too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hell, if you made another one you could probably just supercede this.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ah, the hoster is from the Fate crew.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't know them, but Fate fandom does stuff. ~~But they're a sucky community so fuck em~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): I'll probably make a Saturday event just to be safe
Georgia (Something Sensible): When the RWBY shoots suck (Katsucon... AnimeNEXT...) it tends to really ruin the experience
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): don't need one both days at colossal. No cares.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): as in just saturday is a good idea.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ye and I prob wont cosplay RWBY on Friday anyways
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think Hal and I were pondering Hak and Yona
snow ( crescentbladed ): ~~yas rwby shoot on Saturday would be nice~~
