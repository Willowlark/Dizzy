Rebecca (madameterralupus): üòÆ Do people cosplay to this event? ~~I've always wanted to go but this is my first year actually being able to~~
Erik (slendergiant): Yes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Welp guess imma spend my two days off from classes seeing what HP cosplay I can pull together XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I feel there are a couple I could pull off quickly but rip I have no house merch other than Ravenclaw lmfao~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): 99% of them will be in Harry Potter garb. Ginny Liz did an amazing Peeves a few years back and pelted people with marshmallows. This year may be a little more open, given the loss of the licensing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): If I go I'll be breaking out lily again
Jess (whoozica): ~~your lily is so cute~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh thank you! XD

Jess (whoozica): I wanna work on cosplay but I'm sitting here like "if I buy wigs, that technically working on cosplay right?"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes
Erik (slendergiant): YESSS <@334090409389195266> LET'S DO LILY AND JAMES AGAIN
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ I'll be your child?? XD
Jess (whoozica): I seriously had plans to cut out patterns tonight but I got home and remembered I had to re-do my bookshelves cuz I allready had started that the other day so I felt like I should do cosplay till I did that üòÖ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol and now you're just like nah I am tired?
Jess (whoozica): Ye kinda üòÇ
Jess (whoozica): Maybe I'll brew some coffee and power thru
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay so like yo, those actually going to Chestnut Hill this weekend... anyone got a Gryffindor tie and maybe sweater I can borrow for the day?? ü§î
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!386874959009415170> , you're a Gryffindor yea? You have either of these I could borrow for the day, if not using? ^^ lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yo what day are you going? Saturday?

Rebecca (madameterralupus): üçª Gotta get some drankksss
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I probably will only do Saturday cause work Friday üò≠
Jess (whoozica): Does anyone else find that when they use a pair their "size" is alot bigger than their dress size they buy in the store? The pattern directions out me at like a 10 when my dress size is a 4 üòµ
Jess (whoozica): I always go big tho, cuz I can always down size the garment later
Marisa (Weeb): I find that a lot of patterns have different size charts and I never know which to buy ; u ;
If you have old clothing that fit you really well but you don‚Äôt need anymore they can be used to draft patterns
Marisa (Weeb): Though the same is true for clothes. Why are clothes never the same size.
Jess (whoozica): Sizing sucks butts üòÇ
Marisa (Weeb): Wrap yourself in plastic cling wrap and duct tape

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am glad you started to watch the show~
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Me too I'm in love ! Like so much!! Plus you all look fun cosplaying! I've known who toga was from reading her manga story
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): But I cant wait to see her in the anime ‚ô°

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cause Chris wants to do Iida‚Äôs Hero outfit and I wanna do Ochako‚Äôs or Momo‚Äôs

Jess (whoozica): the problem with working on cosplay after work is you wake up the next morning wanting to continue, but instead you have to go to work
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WOW THATS A MOOD
