Jess (whoozica): <@245270932602486784> or anyone else  do you have any spare medium to light blue fabric? Maybe like 1.5 - 2 yards, something like cotton or even broadcloth?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I‚Äôll check for ya in a hot minute
Jess (whoozica): Thank fren üôè
Anna (Cadmium): Does anyone need an incredible amount of gold spandex. I have like 2-3 yards for no reason whatsoever.
Anna (Cadmium): Better question. How would I go about sewing a vault suit. Should I make it out of heavy spandex or something else?
Georgia (Something Sensible): i used heavy spandex
Georgia (Something Sensible): it makes for a very comfy vault suiting experience lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): and then i had a very VERY thick gold spandex hybrid for the gold detailing
Anna (Cadmium): Sounds good. 
Turns out my yard and garage and the stream and swamp and neighbors yard looks exactly like the wasteland SO I must use this scenery to my advantage. Also a vault suit looks super comfortable. 
Yeah I was thinking about using either iron on gold or something with interfacing for the gold
Anna (Cadmium): Thank
Anna (Cadmium): So if anyone ever wants to do wasteland stuff in NY lmk cause I got 20 acres of wasteland looking property. And a swamp.
Georgia (Something Sensible): oof youre speakin my language

Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Ooooh good shoot locations is always good news.
Anna (Cadmium): And if for some reason you do anything Cloverfield or a quiet place themed or the monster from there. 
My house is actually next to where they filmed it. They filmed a quiet place at the starkdale farm next to my house lmao
So like u can't get better than that
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): We‚Äôve been on the hunt for Nier locations foreverrrr
Georgia (Something Sensible): are you for realz
Georgia (Something Sensible): not that i had any quiet place cosplays in the works but thats just a bamf location to shoot at
Anna (Cadmium): I have not played nier what kinda location is that calling for
Anna (Cadmium): Yes they closed the road for 6 weeks and set fireworks off at 4AM on a weekday
Georgia (Something Sensible): post apocalyptic but the kind of apocalyptic where all the humans lowkey spontaneously disappeared, buildings collapsed, and everything has overgrown shrubbery
Anna (Cadmium): Sooooooooo like abandoned places?
Georgia (Something Sensible): shrubbery being the most important
Georgia (Something Sensible): YE
Georgia (Something Sensible): basically fallout but with more greenery
Anna (Cadmium): Hmmmmmmmmmmmm I'll see what I know about. Abandoned aviation factory has too much graffiti. Maybe an  abandoned insane asylum
Anna (Cadmium): I will look. I know ppl that find these places 
Otherwise like. I might know a few. They would be a lil bit of a drive but if it's a good enough spot like. Good scenery is important
Anna (Cadmium): If only the Catholic college which is definitely a money laundering operation didn't buy the asylum it would be great to shoot at
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Aviation facility sounds lit.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): My dream shot is upward, seeing the ceiling which has pipeline like in a factory running across t.
Anna (Cadmium): Hmmmmmmmmmmmm I'll see what I can do
Anna (Cadmium): I wonder if my friend would let me borrow her German Shepard for fallout pics
Anna (Cadmium): The aviation facility is on Long island and to be fair I've never seen it in daylight. I'll see what I can do. It does have a LOT of graffiti
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Hmmm
Anna (Cadmium): What about flushing park? Like the site of the old world's fair.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): That has amusement park feels doesn‚Äôt it? That‚Äôd be choice.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I‚Äôm not much of an urban explorer, j need to learn.
Anna (Cadmium): Or Coney island really early. They still have lots of stuff from it's heyday and it's less populated in the cold obviously
Anna (Cadmium): And maybe uhhhhh. Jones beach boardwalk. There's a lot of old stuff there that's dilapidated. Once again you gotta go in the off season
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Sounds like I need my trusty shoot planning board.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Did they ever reopen fairytale forest? Because if not.... that would be really cool
Anna (Cadmium): Lol I drive a lot so I find things
Anna (Cadmium): We need a map with pin locations and notes on whats there
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We have the BNE map that was made a bit ago. Maybe we could add them to that??
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think bill has a running list
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But nothing that SCREAMS nier automata
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea we do. I do a lot of urban exploring with my one friend so I have a few locations under my belt
Jess (whoozica): They are working on fairy tale forest now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Damn
Georgia (Something Sensible): oof my wallet is crying, i have now bought my ann wig, ann socks, A2 tights, lux/gwen wig, and more foam
Georgia (Something Sensible): the katsuCRONCH is real
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A big mood. I forgot how much I still need to buy for my stuff and my wallet lately has been crying too lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): even putting in the good work hours, every year, katsu crunch murders me
Georgia (Something Sensible): i still have... some pyrrha upgrades, to buy pyrrha pajamas, finish my fallout prop, make A2, and that it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I thought I was all set with rewearing old costumes and wearing costumes I just got but I totally forgot about things like shoes XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And oh shit... I totally forgot about PJ's for the pj party... D:
Georgia (Something Sensible): im goin to both pj parties cause my favorite part of con is to socialize
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I plan to do both as well if possible.
Georgia (Something Sensible): so ill do rwby 8-10 and the BNHA 11-whenever i sleep in the hallway i guess
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Probably only going to the BNHA PJ party because eyebrows and eyeliner
Georgia (Something Sensible): whats everyone wearing for the formal ball üëÄ
Georgia (Something Sensible): cause i just realized i need a pink dress too oof
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I may just redo Raven from last year and scramble together stuff from own wardrobe for Denki. 
I may only do one though. Will see how I feel lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): o wait i might have one
Rebecca (madameterralupus): As for formal: Idk...I'd do Denki to join everyone else in BNHA buuutt don't wanna do a suit XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): _dress denki_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Don't tempt me dammit lol~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): In all honesty though most voted for Blake buuuttt imma probs do Shinoa cause that flapper dress is pretty üòç
Georgia (Something Sensible): how is "shinoa" pronounced because my mind has been reading it like "quinoa"
Georgia (Something Sensible): like sheen-wa
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Shin - O - Ah
Georgia (Something Sensible): AH ok that clears that up
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like that XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like sheen-wa though XDD
Jess (whoozica): <@!245270932602486784>  would my nora dress work?
Jess (whoozica): you can borrow it if so that way you can save some $$$ it needs a small repair but i should be able to do that real quick
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> and <@!289944569410224129> I‚Äôve got a running list of ideas from last year. We can get together and revamp that.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I‚Äôd like to get some ideas going.
