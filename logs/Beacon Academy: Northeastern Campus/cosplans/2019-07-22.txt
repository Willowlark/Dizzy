Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!289944569410224129> Didn't you find a good spot for Fallout stuff?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: indeed but which type were u looking for
i got swamps, railroads, ~~something thats totally basically trespassing but not if u dont get caught~~ and uh. my entire backyard/garage/basement looks like a settlement workshop
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Aiming for the urban look really. Someone asked me if I had any spots since I posted a picture of Georgia's cosplay.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i mean i know a couple abandoned houses and one place thats like.... uh... u know how in FO4 you can break into multiple hospitals
i know a place like that
Harlem valley state asylum, now its surrounding the Harlem Valley - Wingdale train station on metro north
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: also know the abandoned aviation factory here on LI but idk if that would be a trek
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: its like industrial, but also got lots o graffiti
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i'll ask my friend matt whos coming to cce, he knows a crapton of places in NY, long island, and CT
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: ~~basically urban fallout isnt easy bc vandals~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nah you good I'm trying to find some of the places on google maps.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Lawrence Aviation Drive, Port Jefferson Station, NY is the aviation factory
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: you gotta like. walk there through a paved trail i think
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That seems most promising.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The asylum probably has fences and shit ~~and I'm a bitch so breaking and entering is teh spook~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The train station isn't abandoned right?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: ill ask matt for pics from that. it did have a ton of graffiti
yea see the asylum would be like. pics outside it or on the about face of it so u arent on the school side
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: LOL no it got bought by a christian college.
its a looooong story i'd have to tell in person but the train station is very much active ~~we just dont have a large population~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): True, train stations are sometimes really nice and also empty.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: some parts of the asylum is owned by Olivet university (assholes) buuuuut there;s a handful of buildings (inside... questionable) and an overpass loading thing (abandoned still) that you can use as backgrounds etc that are owned by the train im pretty sure
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: plus free parking at the train
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: https://www.google.com/maps/@41.637809,-73.5710389,3a,75y,258.93h,83.46t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sVOa6T1cvHKiO2Isfom_y2w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: theres uh. no streetview data down the road its on but facing the station thats the best google maps i can give lmao
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: trains only run like. every hour i think. 
~~the town has a population density of 175 persons/sq mile~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): mood my local station is even less frequent.
