Jamie (Jamie): i feel like somewhere on it to have it look like a cape or similar is stuck would also add to the look maybe?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh yee that's a good idea
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also so I was thinking... I got a binch of plain white shirts at work the other day on sale. I only plan to tie dye a few so unsure what to do with others UNTIL I realized I also have a pain red wig I've never done anything with/have no plans for soooo I was thinking... Radical Ed from Cowboy Bebop cosplay??? I planned on it years ago but dropped it but OwO
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I'll pretend to be munching on a cape. Like. A shredded one. Little bits of it 

And YES DO ED I LOVE COWBOY BEBOP
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I might do it :3 It'd be super easy and Cowboy Bebop is awesome~
