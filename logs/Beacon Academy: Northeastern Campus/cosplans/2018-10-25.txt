Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Me, trying to figure out Star Butterfly's arm situation like:
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg üòÇ
Georgia (Something Sensible): LIMBS LMAO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just be like Rocket Raccoon... and take a random limb :p
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): TEMPTING
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yo, anyone here not need their limbs anymore?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~gives my right arm and left leg so can accurately cosplay Ed Elric~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...YO I JUST HAD A BRAIN BLAST LIKE JIMMY FUCKING NEUTRON
my yang arm looks pretty solid on its own, SO IF I MADE 4 MORE OF THOSE and covered them in a skin colored armsock
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): THEN THEY WOULD MOVE LIKE ARMS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WELP. ok goodbye money
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol. Sounds like a lot of work but yea that could work üòÆ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): worbla GET IN MY ARSENAL
Georgia (Something Sensible): You could like... resin cast your arms and make them out of worbla
Erik (slendergiant): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): raid a local Nordstrom‚Äôs and steal the mannequins arms
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ i actually was gonna see if i could get mannequin arms
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but theyre super expensive
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WHY
Georgia (Something Sensible): But then you could only pose the joints
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its just an ARM
Georgia (Something Sensible): STEAL THEM
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no one will notice if i walk out with 4 extra arms
Georgia (Something Sensible): RUN OUT NORDSTROMS CARRYING FOUR ARMS
Georgia (Something Sensible): they‚Äôd be too shocked to stop you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hit up local stores that are closing for them maybe? Often times places closing at the end try to sell off stuff like that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): any sears closings??
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think they were closing at some point
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sears is like... slowing getting there lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Bon Ton? Idk if they are all completely closed or not yet though. I know mine is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if any of you guys end up at a closing store, let this girl know
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cause i need me some LIMBS
Georgia (Something Sensible): Whats the Stevens universe character with extra arms

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Alexandrite, Opal, Sardonyx all have extra arms
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BLESS
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ye look up tutorials for them
Georgia (Something Sensible): And maybe that one symmetry skin lol
Mak (hollyjollymak): Alexandrite was fun because she had an extra mouth!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And yea Sugilite is one too.

Georgia (Something Sensible): IF I FIND ONE ILL SEND HER TO YOU
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like you have a Yukio cosplayer knock on the door like ‚Äúuhhh wezrez said to come here?‚Äù
Mak (hollyjollymak): If you do that I will be forever indebted to you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao, I feel like I am always out of the loop with cosplay communities.. ~~probs cause I just don't socialize XD yay anxietyyy~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bill started talking to labinnak by saying ‚Äúdo you know georgia‚Äù
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Georgia (Something Sensible): At this point I know every ex-Homestuck and RWBY person
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sometimes those categories overlap üëÄ
Mak (hollyjollymak): All of the homestucks went to adventure zone! The person running the adventure zone meetups is someone from all the homestuck ones! I'm still in hell!
Georgia (Something Sensible): That‚Äôs uhhhh cancerously?
Mak (hollyjollymak): Yup!
Georgia (Something Sensible): The old terepy
Georgia (Something Sensible): AHA yeah she was revolutionary
Mak (hollyjollymak): She has like.... war stories
Georgia (Something Sensible): She made convention photoshoots so much more streamlined
Georgia (Something Sensible): I have like an organizational crush on her
Georgia (Something Sensible): I BELIEVE IT
Mak (hollyjollymak): She seems like a god walking amongst mortals
Mak (hollyjollymak): If I stand too close to her during the group photos I feel a bit of radiant light off of her
Georgia (Something Sensible): _you breathe the same air as her_
Mak (hollyjollymak): *[faints]*
Jess (whoozica): Hewwo I did not read all this chat but I am extremely slowly making my way through the adventure zone <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>

you want fucking rwby chibi?: last animenext? i think it was last year.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Hi need to clarify, I saw mangoloo at CCE two years ago, Georgia wasn‚Äôt at the con, I was messaging her that ‚Äúliterally the only thing I could talk to Casey about is knowing you‚Äù. Enough alcohol and a chance encounter had me actually live the meme. 

It‚Äôs true, we had nothing else to talk about. (Ironically even this year when she, jake Casey and I wandered for a few hours)

I do not use Do you know Georgia as an introduction normally.
Erik (slendergiant): New intro line: *"Excuse me, but do you have time to talk about our savior Wezrez Cosplays?"*
you want fucking rwby chibi?: "hey, u heard of the wise rice?"
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I had said Georgia in attempt to not sound like a raving ~~lunatic~~ fanboy, and to her credit Casey recognized the Niamey instantly. So our little wise rice truly is famoose.
Marisa (Weeb): ‚ÄúHave you heard of h t t p colon slash slash w w w dot Instagram dot com slash user slash wezrez‚Äù
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~besides at that point I assumed a nerd like me would never be so involved in the community to spend time with the famoose rtx people~~

~~even if it‚Äôs only cause I know Georgia ~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> I am totes going to want pics of Staryatta FYI.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ask and ye shall receive üòé
