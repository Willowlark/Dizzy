Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~ <@!334090409389195266>  you remember you have photos from that shoot right?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I did tell you you did right?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea I have those too xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SOON BILLIAM
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The shot from Georgia's blog was too cute not to share though xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Vlog*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Just making sure.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cause that's nightmare worthy, not telling someone about the photos for months.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): XD no no I have them you're good
Erik (slendergiant): Ok, so I want to make a story post calling for people who might want to be interested in doing the my GB Team NDGO for Katsu... How terrible would it be for me to temporarily block certain people from my story that I really would not want to potentially join?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think it's fair.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'm not one of them right~~
Erik (slendergiant): No lol
Erik (slendergiant): Did you want to join?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): well, to shoot it.
Jess (whoozica): id say do it itll avoid awkward conversations D:
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): do it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, save you the trouble of lying your way through it.
Erik (slendergiant): now next question, should I hold off on any new stories and let my current ones expire so they don't potentially notice they suddenly can't view my stories? 😅
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): When in doubt, blame instagram!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "it must be a bug"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HUH, weird.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Most people aren't super observant. Then on top of that, people aren't going to want to bring it up with you.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Social Anxiety and all that.
Erik (slendergiant): true
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Unless they want to tell you how hot you are, then suddenly they get over it entirely~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 🙄
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But that's neither here nor there.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm terribly curious who you're worried about joining tho... 🦁
Erik (slendergiant): no one in BNE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I figured as much boyo.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Knowledge is power, and if a trusted friend sees a problem it's good to know about it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Me: "I'm not going to do photos at Katsu, cause crowded and soul sapping"
> Everyone: "Look at this cool idea I'm premiering at KatsU"
> Me, already holding camera: "Fuck"
Jess (whoozica): YEET
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): You could also just say you already have somebody for it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): ~~I know lying is bad but it gets rid of part of the dilemma~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): guys, help, what kind of flower is this?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Jess (whoozica): I believe its a lily?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~am disappointed that was not a sunflower~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BLESS THANK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it is a lily
Jess (whoozica): ~~omg my mom actually managed to teach me something about flowers~~
Jess (whoozica): also if you have a kitty they are poisonous to them, fun fact
Erik (slendergiant): more like "not-so-fun fact"
Jess (whoozica): TRU
Erik (slendergiant): my sister didn't realize that and her bf gave her lilies and she had to take them to her classroom so the cat wouldn't get into them and die
Jess (whoozica): AWWW 😭
Jess (whoozica): yea poinsettias too!
Mark (Mad Doctor): I am Iron Crotch. The under-suit came today and I wanted to test my snuggest piece. Working on the chest piece this week. After that, forearms, biceps, and spalders and the rough armor is done.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): #adulting
Georgia (Something Sensible): _the true most powerful avenger_
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wait until I assert dominance
Erik (slendergiant): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): He's secretly proud
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Pffft
