Rebecca (madameterralupus): I gotta watch my money so this is the best I can find for a vault suit that looks good to me and in my price range. Buuutt the top is separate from the pants?? Think i can modify it/sew them together and still get in it okay to make it all one suit as it's to be??

Georgia (Something Sensible): Zonbi used the one from miccostumes and it looked really good
Georgia (Something Sensible): Dunno how that compares to the amazon one
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is the same one XD Just on their amazon site instead lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Did they modify it at all to not be two separate pieces or? üòÆ
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think they‚Äôre separate
Georgia (Something Sensible): With a utility belt tho I imagine it‚Äôs not that different
Georgia (Something Sensible): Just gotta be careful about raising hands
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmmm okay. I guess whenever I order it I can see what it looks like on as two separate pieces and modify it if I don't like it lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Ok but. Ease of peeing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Valid lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Also u could just like. Do the shirt garter thing   so ur top stays down
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A shirt garter?? Naniii... Oo
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Uhhhhh lemme find a pic
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: 
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: This like one type
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351> Interested lol
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): entering a channel out of context be like
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: There's like six types but like they good for making it so ur dress shirts don't ride uo
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: mARISA CAN U SEND CAT TOE BEAN PICTURES PLS
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): I WOULD BUT SHE'S SLEEPIN AND HER PAWS ARE FACE DOWN NOW
BUT SHE TURNS IN HER SLEEP I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON HER
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: B L E S S
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): her beans are fantastic they're multicolored, change from dark pink to light pink
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've heard the shirt garter things are very uncomfortable
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and if you're wearing it under tight pants, they'd definitely be visible
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Hook and eye attachments it is 
Although if u wear the garter closer to your hip like a rock climbing harness it's easier and shows less
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ok moving Gender Bendgers conversation here
Erik (Red Riot Thot): suggestions for what to do for con-legal pistols for Black Widow? I know rules are usually orange tip and no moving parts (e.g. trigger)
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd get a 3D printed prop of her pistol cause there's no moving parts there's and you can just add in an orange tip. They'll be able to tell it's not real cause both those factors and upon looking at it at weapons check ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean it'll look real hopefully for costume sake and probabaly but the orange tip is the main key factor ya need. That'll help make it not worry some lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I always make my orange tips removable too for photos üëåüèª
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I pushed the orange tip into the barrel of my resident evil revolver oops.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Gotta get an earplug or something to stick in it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee ear plugs or a Woden dowel piece painted orange works too.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Lol paint.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I dunno if anyone was seriously considering this for Ota but their weapons policy is basically non-functioning nerf and water guns
Erik (Red Riot Thot): so get a couple water pistols, break off the trigger, and paint
Georgia (Something Sensible): There‚Äôs those rubber ones!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That could work lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): found some on Amazon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): why is the 2-pack more expensive than buying two singles? lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That... makes no sense... da fuq
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://smile.amazon.com/BladesUSA-Rubber-Training-Black-Painting/dp/B00CHKIMRY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=rubber+pistol&qid=1556557540&s=gateway&sr=8-3
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I like the rubber gun idea. Would have nicer weight to it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ordered a cap shield and electromagnetic harness thing so itll stick to my back, actually wasnt too expensive for both??????? so here's to hoping they both are good....
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeet
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üòÆ <@!334090409389195266> do you have a link for those things?? Mostly the harness lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): harness is kinda expensive, but i feel like i can use it for other things. shield was cheap cause i bought it second hand on ebay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.ebay.com/itm/CATTOYS-Electromagnetic-Leather-Belt-Iron-piece-kit-for-Captain-America-Shield/142818627532
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh shit that's cool
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, like could also be good for pyrrha, not that im doing pyrrha... but
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Bless üôèüèª thank you Leanna!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if yall pyrrha's wanna use it üëÄ
Georgia (Something Sensible): Magnets?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): electromagnets  <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Damn son that‚Äôs 60 bucks
Georgia (Something Sensible): I stuck a magnet in my corset for like 5
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): valid
Georgia (Something Sensible): And it says electromagnets but those look like regular magnets
Georgia (Something Sensible): _dont let the physics words swindle you_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it has battery pack tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol some of us are lazy Georgia and rather spend more money than do more work ~~I.e. me...~~

Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): What do you mean?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Erik is short.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Right Erik? Like, 5 4 or somethin.
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): 5, 4. sometimes 3.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): erik should be antman
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I should be the ant that is also his friend
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That he rides or whatever
Georgia (Something Sensible): What i mean is that‚Äôs a lot of magnet for a piece of foam
Georgia (Something Sensible): That plate would do well for an actual metal ~~vibranium~~ shield
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh the shield is metal
Erik (Red Riot Thot): what kind of metal?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): if it's aluminum or stainless it won't work
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no idea, whatever marvel decided to make it out of, prob aluminum. but the magnet thing comes with a plate that you attach to it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oooooh ok coolio
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye it comes with a metal disc that you put inside the shield
Erik (Red Riot Thot): wait you got like, an actual prop replica? üòÆ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea its one of the ones they released during infinity war or something, someone was selling it for 30 dollars on ebay,
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the ones with the leather straps on the inside
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): shit dude that's cheap as fuck
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's actually a steal
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea fam, the paint looks a little beat up but i can tfix it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like not bad beat up, but like some scratches
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like probably a kid owned it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.ebay.com/itm/Avengers-Infinity-War-Black-Widow-Electric-Staff-Baton-Stick-Weapon-Cosplay-Prop/232732257709?hash=item362fec6dad:g:y3YAAOSwsLBbC9NB
Erik (Red Riot Thot): would be cool if they lit up
Erik (Red Riot Thot): then the price would be worth
Erik (Red Riot Thot): otherwise I could probs make that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof that expensive
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): Ouch
Could make that out of pvc and tape yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I wanna look into what they use for lightsabers because I could fill it with blue lighting inside, and give it a light black coat of paint. Enough to make it look black normally, but light enough the lights could shine through
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Andrew is looking into lights for Shield Hero, fyi.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): He also new to them.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've done like nothing today except look up lightsaber tutorials to adapt for electro batons
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Kind of want to do her Age of Ultron look with the glowing blue bits
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I was looking into Dr. Strange outfits and oof I found one I really like detail wise but it's $400+ <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Guess I'll be saving up to do that and buy pieces slowly... but that's not even the wig, boots or etc. Just the cape, belts and main tunic pieces lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): here's at least a cheap cape that you might be able to use
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://smile.amazon.com/Deluxe-Halloween-Costume-Accessories-STC11510-54/dp/B0041RQ3HC/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=doctor+strange+costume&qid=1556569477&s=gateway&sr=8-10
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmmm that could work but I'd have to do the details to it. I'll probs just save up for the one I am looking at cause it does come with a good chunk of things for the price
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't need it tll Katsu sooo got plenty of time to save up for it lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I feel this with Loki outfits they are all expensive
Mark (Mad Doctor): I saw a Dr Strange cosplay where they used the former rug from the convention center to make the lining of the cape
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF

Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *mag is actually like afraid of fursuiters so im outta ppl on that one*
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: who do we know thats short
Mark (Mad Doctor): Was looking at mature Marvel women that I could genderbend. The pickings are slim. Basically Frigga and the Ancient One, neither of which really appeals. There's always Yondu as Mary Poppins...

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): unless it's ok to invite her here
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shes in ny
Georgia (Something Sensible): GendervengERS ASSEMBLE

Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: we can even just make a discord group chat
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): true
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: discord group chat assemble?
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): can we set nicknames in a group chat?
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ...........................................................................................brb lemme check
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think so?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): That group could get large, might want to make an event page.
Marisa („ÅäÂâç„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ≠ª„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Çã): if not nicknames you'll need a spreadsheet of everyone like we did for konkon
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): No you cannot.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: yep no
Georgia (Something Sensible): Event page is nice but doesn‚Äôt leave any room for discussion
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Also discord DMs have a person cap of 10.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *separete discord server?*

Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Though true, I did say I was trying to back off big groups after Katsu didn't I.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm basing mine off Widow's Ultron outfit
