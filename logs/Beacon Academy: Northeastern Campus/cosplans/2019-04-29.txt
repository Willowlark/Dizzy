Rebecca (madameterralupus): I gotta watch my money so this is the best I can find for a vault suit that looks good to me and in my price range. Buuutt the top is separate from the pants?? Think i can modify it/sew them together and still get in it okay to make it all one suit as it's to be??
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DZM4GJK/?coliid=I1DT4JWSRKNNZX&colid=3LEU8NVFUHTAR&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it&th=1&psc=1
Georgia (Something Sensible): Zonbi used the one from miccostumes and it looked really good
Georgia (Something Sensible): Dunno how that compares to the amazon one
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is the same one XD Just on their amazon site instead lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Did they modify it at all to not be two separate pieces or? 😮
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think they’re separate
Georgia (Something Sensible): With a utility belt tho I imagine it’s not that different
Georgia (Something Sensible): Just gotta be careful about raising hands
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmmm okay. I guess whenever I order it I can see what it looks like on as two separate pieces and modify it if I don't like it lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Ok but. Ease of peeing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Valid lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Also u could just like. Do the shirt garter thing   so ur top stays down
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A shirt garter?? Naniii... Oo
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Uhhhhh lemme find a pic
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: 
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: This like one type
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351> Interested lol
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): entering a channel out of context be like
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: There's like six types but like they good for making it so ur dress shirts don't ride uo
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: mARISA CAN U SEND CAT TOE BEAN PICTURES PLS
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): I WOULD BUT SHE'S SLEEPIN AND HER PAWS ARE FACE DOWN NOW
BUT SHE TURNS IN HER SLEEP I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON HER
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: B L E S S
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): her beans are fantastic they're multicolored, change from dark pink to light pink
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've heard the shirt garter things are very uncomfortable
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and if you're wearing it under tight pants, they'd definitely be visible
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Hook and eye attachments it is 
Although if u wear the garter closer to your hip like a rock climbing harness it's easier and shows less
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ok moving Gender Bendgers conversation here
Erik (Red Riot Thot): suggestions for what to do for con-legal pistols for Black Widow? I know rules are usually orange tip and no moving parts (e.g. trigger)
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd get a 3D printed prop of her pistol cause there's no moving parts there's and you can just add in an orange tip. They'll be able to tell it's not real cause both those factors and upon looking at it at weapons check 🤷🏻‍♀️
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean it'll look real hopefully for costume sake and probabaly but the orange tip is the main key factor ya need. That'll help make it not worry some lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I always make my orange tips removable too for photos 👌🏻
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I pushed the orange tip into the barrel of my resident evil revolver oops.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gotta get an earplug or something to stick in it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee ear plugs or a Woden dowel piece painted orange works too.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lol paint.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I dunno if anyone was seriously considering this for Ota but their weapons policy is basically non-functioning nerf and water guns
Erik (Red Riot Thot): so get a couple water pistols, break off the trigger, and paint
Georgia (Something Sensible): There’s those rubber ones!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That could work lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): found some on Amazon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): why is the 2-pack more expensive than buying two singles? lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That... makes no sense... da fuq
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://smile.amazon.com/BladesUSA-Rubber-Training-Black-Painting/dp/B00CHKIMRY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=rubber+pistol&qid=1556557540&s=gateway&sr=8-3
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I like the rubber gun idea. Would have nicer weight to it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ordered a cap shield and electromagnetic harness thing so itll stick to my back, actually wasnt too expensive for both??????? so here's to hoping they both are good....
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeet
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😮 <@!334090409389195266> do you have a link for those things?? Mostly the harness lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): harness is kinda expensive, but i feel like i can use it for other things. shield was cheap cause i bought it second hand on ebay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://www.ebay.com/itm/CATTOYS-Electromagnetic-Leather-Belt-Iron-piece-kit-for-Captain-America-Shield/142818627532
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh shit that's cool
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, like could also be good for pyrrha, not that im doing pyrrha... but
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Bless 🙏🏻 thank you Leanna!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if yall pyrrha's wanna use it 👀
Georgia (Something Sensible): Magnets?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): electromagnets  <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Damn son that’s 60 bucks
Georgia (Something Sensible): I stuck a magnet in my corset for like 5
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): valid
Georgia (Something Sensible): And it says electromagnets but those look like regular magnets
Georgia (Something Sensible): _dont let the physics words swindle you_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it has battery pack tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol some of us are lazy Georgia and rather spend more money than do more work ~~I.e. me...~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.ebay.com/itm/Avengers-4-Endgame-Shoes-Black-Widow-Leather-Boots-Natasha-Romanoff-Props-Cos/153466065444?var=453420958859&hash=item23bb4a5224:m:mFx9-Z1DCzAiS-_o6c30-zA
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *THEY HAVE MY SIZE
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙌🏻
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *I CAN BE TOL*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Even toller?? 😱
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What do you mean?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Erik is short.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Right Erik? Like, 5 4 or somethin.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): 5, 4. sometimes 3.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): erik should be antman
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I should be the ant that is also his friend
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That he rides or whatever
Georgia (Something Sensible): What i mean is that’s a lot of magnet for a piece of foam
Georgia (Something Sensible): That plate would do well for an actual metal ~~vibranium~~ shield
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh the shield is metal
Erik (Red Riot Thot): what kind of metal?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): if it's aluminum or stainless it won't work
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): no idea, whatever marvel decided to make it out of, prob aluminum. but the magnet thing comes with a plate that you attach to it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oooooh ok coolio
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye it comes with a metal disc that you put inside the shield
Erik (Red Riot Thot): wait you got like, an actual prop replica? 😮
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea its one of the ones they released during infinity war or something, someone was selling it for 30 dollars on ebay,
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the ones with the leather straps on the inside
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): shit dude that's cheap as fuck
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's actually a steal
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea fam, the paint looks a little beat up but i can tfix it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like not bad beat up, but like some scratches
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like probably a kid owned it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.ebay.com/itm/Avengers-Infinity-War-Black-Widow-Electric-Staff-Baton-Stick-Weapon-Cosplay-Prop/232732257709?hash=item362fec6dad:g:y3YAAOSwsLBbC9NB
Erik (Red Riot Thot): would be cool if they lit up
Erik (Red Riot Thot): then the price would be worth
Erik (Red Riot Thot): otherwise I could probs make that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof that expensive
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Ouch
Could make that out of pvc and tape yeah
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I wanna look into what they use for lightsabers because I could fill it with blue lighting inside, and give it a light black coat of paint. Enough to make it look black normally, but light enough the lights could shine through
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Andrew is looking into lights for Shield Hero, fyi.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He also new to them.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've done like nothing today except look up lightsaber tutorials to adapt for electro batons
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Kind of want to do her Age of Ultron look with the glowing blue bits
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I was looking into Dr. Strange outfits and oof I found one I really like detail wise but it's $400+ <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Guess I'll be saving up to do that and buy pieces slowly... but that's not even the wig, boots or etc. Just the cape, belts and main tunic pieces lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): here's at least a cheap cape that you might be able to use
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://smile.amazon.com/Deluxe-Halloween-Costume-Accessories-STC11510-54/dp/B0041RQ3HC/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=doctor+strange+costume&qid=1556569477&s=gateway&sr=8-10
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmmm that could work but I'd have to do the details to it. I'll probs just save up for the one I am looking at cause it does come with a good chunk of things for the price
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't need it tll Katsu sooo got plenty of time to save up for it lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I feel this with Loki outfits they are all expensive
Mark (Mad Doctor): I saw a Dr Strange cosplay where they used the former rug from the convention center to make the lining of the cape
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: everyone: guess my secret cosplay
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: me: -in this group- OH BOY I BET I CAN GET IT
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: OwO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ XD Same I keep wanting to reply but then I'm like that's not far cause I know LOL

Georgia (Something Sensible): I should’ve been clearer with the last hint lol
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: nah dont
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: did we set a deadline. and did i miss this while driving
Erik (Red Riot Thot): someone thought my genderbend was going to be Shazam and I was like bruh it wouldn't be a genderbend
Erik (Red Riot Thot): his first guess was "something gay af"
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: surprisingly not
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think by next Katsu at latest
Georgia (Something Sensible): /cracks knuckles TIME TO FIND A VALKYRIE MAN
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ...........gfdi mag wanted to do that but that is not a bend
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *worst case we get a standard valkyrie
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: pleassee
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: you need to find thors true love
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: a raccoon girl
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *mag is actually like afraid of fursuiters so im outta ppl on that one*
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: who do we know thats short
Mark (Mad Doctor): Was looking at mature Marvel women that I could genderbend. The pickings are slim. Basically Frigga and the Ancient One, neither of which really appeals. There's always Yondu as Mary Poppins...
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ah yes
Georgia (Something Sensible): _we must find a furry lady_
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i'm literally making a raccoon girl now for animenext but i am not a furry for a record

Georgia (Something Sensible): Wait I thought rebecca was lookin at strange
Georgia (Something Sensible): So mawisa can be ~~furry~~ rocket

Georgia (Something Sensible): Mawisa how do you feel about furry ears and a tactical vest
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause that’s _basically_ what you need

Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): just. things laying around y'know
Georgia (Something Sensible): _tactical vest?_

Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: and furry ears and tail
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ok now im judging how many tactical vests do yall have
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): oh the story behind the tactical vests gets *deep*
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): involving literal murder
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ....

Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): when they were not wearing the vests
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ah. estate sale. got it

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): literally just me the cosplay
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I found cycling pants and a cycling shirt to use
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Looked up how to attach EL wire to clothing but it might not work right with stretchy clothes...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Maggie, emberarendele, wants to join the GB avengers
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Please
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: help i wanna make the whole bucky
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: YES GET HER IN ON THIS
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: i love her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we should maybe make a smaller group chat so others can join in?
Georgia (Something Sensible): that might be smart yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): unless it's ok to invite her here
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shes in ny
Georgia (Something Sensible): GendervengERS ASSEMBLE
Georgia (Something Sensible): I would make a separate group chat anyways in case we recruit more people tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): Which, we probably will
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: we can even just make a discord group chat
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): true
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: discord group chat assemble?
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): can we set nicknames in a group chat?
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ...........................................................................................brb lemme check
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think so?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That group could get large, might want to make an event page.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): if not nicknames you'll need a spreadsheet of everyone like we did for konkon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No you cannot.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: yep no
Georgia (Something Sensible): Event page is nice but doesn’t leave any room for discussion
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also discord DMs have a person cap of 10.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *separete discord server?*
Georgia (Something Sensible): Make a new server for gendervengers?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): do we wanna try to get mostly single characters?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so we end up with like full team
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Instagram group chat?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Uhmmm I would say make an attempt but I wouldn’t bar any duplicates
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Georgia (Something Sensible): Instagram group chats are hell to talk in tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): They also have a cap
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 15 person cap.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: TIL you can have group chats on instagram
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: i mean even 15 is a lot for a group
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: a cosplay group
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You're learning all sorts of things today
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: I really am its great
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): How many people outside BNE do you actually have, before you jump the gun...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we can just make a new server
Georgia (Something Sensible): Only one right now but COULD BE MORE LATER
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maggie, and probably topher if maggie joins
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: VALKRIE??
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh I know who they are.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but theres been a lot of excitement about it
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): o yeah that is a big group, what con was this being planned for?
it'd require like at least an hour just for our own genderbend meetup
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: idk i wanna do photos in NYC but this isn't something you would wear to ANYC so unless we're planning like..... katsu....
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ~~and fuck NYCC~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~do people still stick to anime for anime cons?~~
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): is anyone going to shikkaricon?
Georgia (Something Sensible): What the fuck is anime
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): anime is life
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): MOOD GEORGIA
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i have to quit this server i can not BELIEVE those words were just uttered
Georgia (Something Sensible): :3c
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: party at my place bring the booze
Georgia (Something Sensible): Katsu is probably the goal tbh
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: jk marisa ily
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tho a group shoot in NYC would be LITTY
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: katsu as the goal, NYC photos later that summer?
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: i have a reason hear me out
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): there's a con in philly in october but it's "new" - returning after like 6 years of nothing
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i love anime my soul is physically injured aegrshtjdkfjhgf
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: theres a big ass building going up next to grand central terminal and it will be much more completed than it currently is so less orange construction material in the background
and stark tower is located where the metlife building is in nyc which is right next to grand central
Georgia (Something Sensible): O baby
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m sold on Katsu
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean I’ll have thor hopefully done sooner but I’m sold
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): no walking around nyc with fake guns tho
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hammers tho
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: thats fine tho honestly we dont *need* props and.

Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: srs who has a 'gun' prop besides bucky really
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): widow
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: she does have other props tho doesnt she have the wrist things and the batons
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hawkeye has bow/sword
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): rocket has.... rocket launcher? 🤔
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: i feel bow would be okay with no string and a safety color
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: rocket has.... *that guy's leg*
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i hope we find a t'challa that'd be sweet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omg i hope so
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: maybe maggie knows someone even
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: someone set up that server
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: OH ALSO NO KNIVES IN NYC
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ye I'm planning to make the batons
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: its like a 4" rule to begin with
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ,...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I carry a pocket knife in the city all the time.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: as long as its not assisted open and under 4"
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: its safe
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: but im pretty sure hunting style knives like the mcu ppl use is not
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ah.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Am I shooting this.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: so anyways what movie is everyone doin them from or what cause i was debating sewing the winter soldier bucky actually
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: me n skirts n dresses is a hard mix so im gonna. pants
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): would you like to bill?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): are you interested?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I'm going to be involved one way or the other, I hate being out of the loop~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: or u want in on the other side of the camera cause.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'd say everyone just do whatever outfit they want rather than try to coordinate something
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though true, I did say I was trying to back off big groups after Katsu didn't I.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm basing mine off Widow's Ultron outfit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://discord.gg/WHk6hk
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Which conveniently is on TV right now
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *bengers*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Why is Ultron literally just robotic James Spader
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: u know i never did see that movie
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Can I join it not doing anything.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): sure?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I mean my dumb ass’ll go to whatever event this happens at con or not cause that’s what I do so~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Emotional Support Billiam is always doing something
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Snrk.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): random civilian caught up in the battle cosplay
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: Tired NYC buildings department employee Bill
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: or pop on a blonde wig n Pepper Pots
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bill is Jarvis confirmed
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He’s dead.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And has no body.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And is dead.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Do the original Jarvis lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Besides Erik pointed out Jessica Jones is a thing and I’m already a snarky, overly inquisitive, bourbon drinking bitch.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also that would be hella comfy cosplay
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Trick is would it look like a genderbend Jessica Jones or me in a scarf.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): gotta get the black leather jacket
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and put some makeup under your eyes so you look exhausted and dead inside
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and the scarf
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also alcohol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I already have a black leather jacket. <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): there you go! youre already almost there
