Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm four episodes into Goblin Slayer. Way darker and more interesting than I anticipated. Adding titular character to my cosplans
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Goblin slayer verrrry dark yes.
Mark (Mad Doctor): From the cover I was expecting a light fantasy romp...holy shit! No one told me Gygax was DMing this game!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™d call it more of a Tuckerâ€™s Kobolds.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I like Goblin Slayer. Once you get past THAT scene it turns into a dark fantasy romp with a character who is basically the Doom Guy and a cleric who is done with his shit XD 

Which... Is relatable.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Berserk > Goblin Slayer, for dark fantasy series imo. Couldn't really get in GS. Maybe trying the anime over the manga was my mistake. But the main character does have a great design I will admit.
Mark (Mad Doctor): The armor is intricate, but it looks easy to break down into small, manageable steps. Maybe for next year's Katsu
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Funny enough I helped a GS cosplayer during Katsu badge pickup this year. Dude was nice. I felt bad he didn't have anyone helping him.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Jamie (Jamie): My nephew has expressed he wants to be deku for next zenkaikon ðŸ‘€

Jamie (Jamie): Nah thats my sisters job lol it will be perfect

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Aahhh yesss

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thank you!!
Marisa (Mawisa): oo u found the secret zenkai staircase :3c
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YES IT WAS LOVELY
