Jess (whoozica): My eye doctor gave me a perscription for contacts without astigmatism so I could order colored contacts (without paying $60-$80) I am so happy
Jess (whoozica): She also gave me a pair of blue for free but they have no perscription
Georgia (Something Sensible): owo coolio
Georgia (Something Sensible): fake eye colors are always the bomb dot com
Erik (slendergiant): Unless looking for unnatural colors with a script. Can't find red anywhere
Jess (whoozica): I saw some on honey color ðŸ˜® unless it's hard even with a script?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I think it depends on your script
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I cant get prescription contacts because my script without astigmatism is too weak so I have to just get planos
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Otherwise, like you, astigmatism contacts are like 60-80$
Jess (whoozica): Yea astigmatism contacts are ridiculousl
