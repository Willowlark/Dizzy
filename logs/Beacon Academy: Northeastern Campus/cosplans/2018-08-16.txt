Matt (mattmyers25): Umm because planning. Friday would work for me
you want fucking rwby chibi?: tbf i dont have the money for new cosplays for katsu so im just using what i have or am aiming to finish before then. so technically ive decided for katsu already
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ I plan to try and do that cause doing new costumes and why I am so tight on money all the time T_T But I know that won't happen fully cause I have no self control lmfao. If it fails for katsu at least aiming to do so for most of the years cons lol.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: my self control is lack of funds since i barely have money to exist period
you want fucking rwby chibi?: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
