Jess (whoozica): New problem: sewing machine in coldest room of house üò≠
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Solution: space heater
Jess (whoozica): Must find
Marisa (Weeb): Solution: sew so much you overheat the machine and generate your own heat source
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Jess (whoozica): Omg üòÇ I resorted to cutting more patterns cuz I didn't do them all last night
Georgia (Something Sensible): does anyone not yet own a dremmel? i lost the accessories to mine and cant get more without buying an entirely new dremmel
Georgia (Something Sensible): so would anyone want it lol
Erik (slendergiant): You can't get accessories for a dremel?
Georgia (Something Sensible): are they standard? i wanna make sure they fit the dremmel i have
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A8DXKXS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have that one
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I bought tom dremel accessories for his birthday, you can get them.
Erik (slendergiant): https://www.homedepot.com/p/Dremel-Rotary-Tool-Accessory-Kit-130-Piece-713-01/206360400
Georgia (Something Sensible): all dremmel accessories fit on all tools?
Georgia (Something Sensible): i did not know this
Georgia (Something Sensible): ‚ú® the more you know ‚ú®
ZombieHunter: Since the lock is adjustable, yes
ZombieHunter: They‚Äôre once size fits most.
ZombieHunter: I buy cheap tools are harbor freight
ZombieHunter: At
Georgia (Something Sensible): owo amazon has the kit erik linked for 17 buckaroos
Erik (slendergiant): There might be different shaft sizes which require the appropriately sized grippy part, but the grippy parts all should fit into the tool itself
Georgia (Something Sensible): the grippy part being the metal?
ZombieHunter: I saw a notification that just said shaft sizes and I thought it was nsfw
Marisa (Weeb): woah woah woah. nsfw chat
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://www.amazon.com/Dremel-709-02-110-Piece-All-Purpose-Accessory/dp/B00OAXKJO0/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid=1539744856&sr=8-14&keywords=Rotary+Tool+Accessory+Kit
ZombieHunter: Marisa gets me
Georgia (Something Sensible): does that look like itll work?
Georgia (Something Sensible): i mean i dont see why not
Georgia (Something Sensible): im not a power tools perSON IM A FAKER FOR COSPLAY PURPOSES CRIES
ZombieHunter: The base in most dremels are the same
ZombieHunter: You screw it tighter to grip the pieces.
ZombieHunter: Georgia do you twist the end to tighten onto the tips?
Georgia (Something Sensible): yup!
ZombieHunter: Then anything goes for the most part
Georgia (Something Sensible): kk i trust yall but ill double check with my dad in the morning
Georgia (Something Sensible): if he says so then it GOTTA be true
Marisa (Weeb): what are dremels used for?
ZombieHunter: Sanding and shaping
Georgia (Something Sensible): i just wish i hadnt been a doof and misplaced my accessories beforehand
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^^
Georgia (Something Sensible): i use it for mostly sanding
Erik (slendergiant): The Grippy Part‚Ñ¢
Marisa (Weeb): ooo like small bits?
Marisa (Weeb): makes sense
ZombieHunter: I‚Äôve used it for polishing maybe once
ZombieHunter: Thank you erik. Exactly this
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/95c5e78c-a622-42d2-8542-40959c4b3d6a.jpg._CB314275082_.jpg
Georgia (Something Sensible): so the rod screws off and it leaves the cylinder part
Georgia (Something Sensible): to my recollection
Georgia (Something Sensible): altho its 3 dollars cheaper just to get a new dremmel with all the pieces
Georgia (Something Sensible): whats up with that LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): so i guess my previous point stands, does anyone want a dremmel, ill give you some of my accessories üòÇ
ZombieHunter: Georgia are there more accessories in the full dremel?
Georgia (Something Sensible): theres 100 accessories in the full one
ZombieHunter: Since eventually you will have to replace the sanding bits and things too
Georgia (Something Sensible): i just happened to misplace all of them
Georgia (Something Sensible): honestlyyyy i only need the sanding ones too which is a shame
Georgia (Something Sensible): im just worried ill waste money buying bits that dont fit oof
ZombieHunter: I have had 3 different ones
ZombieHunter: They all fit. Especially when they know dremel is the name brand
ZombieHunter: They‚Äôll try to go by those standards so people@can still use the parts
Georgia (Something Sensible): im trying to find it for the "WEN" brand i us, a kit with just accessories
Georgia (Something Sensible): all i see is buying the dremmel again with all the accessories
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats some whack marketing
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think for now ill be on the same side and order another dremmel (hinging on what my dad says in the morning)
ZombieHunter: Georgia
Georgia (Something Sensible): mostly cause i have a deadline LOL
ZombieHunter: 
ZombieHunter: If you go to the question part
Georgia (Something Sensible): AHA
Georgia (Something Sensible): SUPER SLEUTH HUNTER thank you <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
ZombieHunter: Gdi Georgia
