Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Swimsuit for Raven came in. Thanks to my mom for having a black cover up wrap I can use to tie in the black color lol.
Should I add a design to the top? ðŸ¤” or just leave it plain?
Imma have her necklaces on so idk if that'd be enough to make the top part for stylistic lol.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): hmmm I think a design on the top would be cool
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also not sure how I feel about this top showing my scar fully ðŸ¤” ðŸ˜«
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If I did a design I was thinking something like feathers (obvs painted on lol, no wet feathers here)
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): there are beach cover ups that look like shirts too
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): if that makes you feel better
Matt (mattmyers25): Feathers everywhere
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): but I think Raven would be the kind of gal to show off scars
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You know what they say, chicks dig scars.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): And what Monica said.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Own it girl. ðŸ˜„
Matt (mattmyers25): I agree with Monica
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): "you wanna know how I got these scars?"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): "Taiyang said I 'tore his heart out'. So I showed up him what that would *really* look like."
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is true. Maybe keeping it showing would be fitting to the character... I just get nervous showing it off cause I still get really self conscious about it for some reason >.<
Erik (slendergiant): <@!288513265661902858>  <@143910209738244096>  looking like it would probs be Friday of Katsu. Are you strong maybes or can I start opening it up to other people?
Emerling: Im not entirely sure ill be able to do it :/
Erik (slendergiant): that's a'ight
