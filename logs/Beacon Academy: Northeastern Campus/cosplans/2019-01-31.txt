Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, I'm guessing I need to adjust my tension settings. Do I tighten or loosen?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Never mind. Found an answer
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Wait what was the answer I get this too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): L√∂√∂ps br√∂ther
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Uggghhhh Tai's vest is taking way longer than it should be because I've been spending most of the time ripping seams

Erik (Red Riot Thot): *V E S T*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh yo those seams look TIGHT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Good shit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It was worth the pain
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It only kind of doesn't fit right üëçüèª
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh no
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh no but it looks good. Does it fit too big or too small? üòÆ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It fits except the part at the neck bulges out
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But it's in the back so it's not super important
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Interesting ü§î
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Does it bulge out very much?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And true, it's the back so won't be too noticeable
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Maybe like an inch or so?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahh that's not too bad
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I could add a dart if I wanted to, but not tonight
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Honestly you might want to keep the extra bulge make sure it doesn't like. Hella impact your ability to raise your arms if you were to take it in
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's true
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i made my athena vest not have a bulge in the back and i cant lift my arms above my chin
