Anna (Cadmium): I call this. Broke stenciling
Mark (Mad Doctor): Gungnir has been worbla-ed. To smooth out some of the rough edges, is it better to heat it and mold it with fingers, or to sand it?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've only used worbla a few times but in my limited experience I'd say heat and mold
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Heat then mold.  Maybe sand a bit then if needed
