Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Okay, I need advisement. I have a (real) leather jacket I love (see story). Thereâ€™s a couple spots on it that basically squeak when you rub them. Iâ€™ve never treated it, out of fear of damaging it, but I canâ€™t help thinking I need to treat it to solve that problem.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yâ€™all work with leather sometimes, what do I use that doesnâ€™t dye/damage my jacket?
Jess (whoozica): Vinegar and water I think
