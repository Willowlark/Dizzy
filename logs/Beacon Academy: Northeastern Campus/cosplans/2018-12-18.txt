Jess (whoozica): Ohhh that would be sweet if but yea pricey
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We found some options so I may go back and get one of them eventually but for now got just a basic lime green lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And yea $20 for it was deff pricey XD I was like oof
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I thought we had contact cement at work but we don't. Only rubber. Is that good to use on EVA or no? Idk the difference and nor did my coworker lol.
Jess (whoozica): On my experience not works the same I used rubber cement on magnhild
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Jess (whoozica): If you wanna use specifically contact cement you can get it at home Depot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I would recommend contact cement
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Rubber cement can be pulled apart
Jess (whoozica): If you go to the adhesives aisle in home Depot or lowes, the company "weldward" makes it among others
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm okay. I'll just make a trip to Home Depot or Lowes this week then. I thought we had it and was gonna try to save some monies with my discount buuuttt we didn't 😦 I was gonna get it ad try but waited just to be safe, glad I did lol.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): i dont know why i had a breif thought that contact sement was for putting contacts in
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They have little bottles or cans. I recommend the can because it'll last longer. My bottle started drying up on me
Tom (tomukuncosplay): dont... dont do that
Jess (whoozica): Yea that orib not a good idea tom
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LOL TOM OMG.
And noted! I remember you saying your dried up. Ill make sure to get the can then. Thanks!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yo, I always carry a bottle of eye drops for my contacts at cons and also a bottle of super glue and I'm paranoid one day I might mix them up somehow 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Jess (whoozica): OMG pls no
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ooooh no that was my canned plastidip

Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@334090409389195266> that's what the Kyle looks like where the undercut begins
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Are the divers on the undercut really densely packed? Cause I might wanna cut them shorter but I dont want the wafts to show
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Fibers*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Are the divers on the undercut really densely packed? Cause I might wanna cut them shorter but I dont want the wafts to show
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Fibers*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I personally would not recommend cutting them much shorter
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You're not gonna get that buzz cut look if that's what you're aiming for
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oof ye alright I'll just have to work with it then
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Thank you for the photos! Very helpful
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's pretty dense right where they merge, but it evens out as it gets further out
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'll figure something out definitely. But itll definitely work for what I'm going for. Just gotta have faith in my wig skills xD
