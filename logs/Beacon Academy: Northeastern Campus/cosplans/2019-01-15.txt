Anna (Cadmium): Yeah to be fair the backstory was better than the game.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP
I like Nisha
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's like it... And Jack's whole deal
Anna (Cadmium): i need to remake the armor bits for nisha for Mag..... hers were cardboard and duct tape
Anna (Cadmium): ok actually wilhelm was my fave and it was incredibly depressing to me that the more you played as him and worked down his skill tree that he turned more and more robot and his voice changed too
Anna (Cadmium): ~~fucking steam tho i lost my saves~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna be Nisha badly but I'm utterly horrified to do the cell shading
Jess (whoozica): Don't be! You actually have alot of freedom with it
Anna (Cadmium): *slides in* HELLO
Jess (whoozica): I was thinking about eventually upgrading Lilith to the Borderlands 2/presequel look
Anna (Cadmium): although i will say. getting drunk definitely helps your cell shading
Jess (whoozica): Oh yea. Mine was done while drinking tok
Anna (Cadmium): the only thing to fear with nisha is sweating your ass off in a coat with one arm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~getting drunk helps most cosplay making ive found~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~90% of my Cosplay work is done whole drinking~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~same~~
Anna (Cadmium): alcoholics over here
Jess (whoozica): Glad I'm not the only one üòÇ
Anna (Cadmium): literally my entire rwbylands has been while drinking
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it like... boosts my creativity? and motivation???
Anna (Cadmium): it boosts the 'fuck it this is good enough'
Jess (whoozica): I'm not as scared to try new stuff or unorthodox techniques
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Jess (whoozica): Yea it helps me not take everything so damn seriously
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shit I should drink some wine before working on a cosolay
Erik (Red Riot Thot): same...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Or what is your recommendation for the alcohols. I'm a lightweight so it goes theough me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I remember getting drunk and doing engineering homework once
Anna (Cadmium): seriously though im like. tryna get cel shading up to the unachievable level casey and krista have.
Anna (Cadmium): its getting there
Georgia (Something Sensible): /takes notes
Anna (Cadmium): <@!229713389511901185> hard cider

Anna (Cadmium): ye. Or citizen cider (the red ones only)
Anna (Cadmium): NOT Redds apple ale
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hmm
Well we have a whole thing at the apartment soooooooooo
Anna (Cadmium): hard cider is delicious
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof Redd's is garbage
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If Chris didn't clean it out -___-
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Redd's isnhoeeivle
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the green apple one isn't bad, but the regular def is
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *is horrible
Anna (Cadmium): its beer
Anna (Cadmium): redds is apple beer
Anna (Cadmium): its a disgrace
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Magner's is a good cider brand. I like the pear cider

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hit me with that vodka
Anna (Cadmium): Brooklyn Republic
Anna (Cadmium): not the cheapest, but the most smooth
Anna (Cadmium): the lemon lychee is heavenly
Jess (whoozica): Something without an ass load of alcohol content. Like beer, cider, spiked seltzer you don't wanna be drinking wine or anything hard if you're a lightweight. Or make your own drinks with hard stuff but cut the alcohol down (I do this) I am quite often a lightweight as well
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I drink any vodka 
Vodka is my stuff 
I usually don't drink that unless I'm aiming to have a good time
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hard cider and wine are kinda my chill drinks
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mcfreaking love vodka

Jess (whoozica): Purastill?
Jess (whoozica): yea its sold in NY
Anna (Cadmium): interesting. sounds like death
Anna (Cadmium): anyways if u catch me almost vomiting after wig styling its the hairspray smells exactly like pinnacle plain
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think more so she was interested in it? A few years ago she made her own and gave them out as presents. So I got her the real stuff this year and hers compared pretty well to the real thing
