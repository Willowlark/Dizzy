Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need to buy more bobbins so I don't have to keep wasting thread switching my colors...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh someone else has that problem too? XD
Jess (whoozica): Mood
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Bernina makes a machine with a bobbin that's almost twice as large as normal and like. Goals. But. My wallet would KILL ME I cannot afford a Bernina
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My machine requires a certain type of bobbin and I have to see if they're readily available at Joann's
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Any sewing repair places near you? Might be a better bet
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's the SA156 bobbin. Joann's has them. Just gotta remember to buy some next time I go
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ...... How does one check their bobbin and needle types btw
Marisa (Mawisa): Check the manual or just use trial and error
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ^
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My manual says explicitly to use that certain type otherwise my machine won't work and could cause injury
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Needles I just look for the ones that say compatible with Brother machines
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~u assume this manual from 1994 lists that~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Wait shit it's in the least logical place I found a NUMBER
Anna (loud and likely blonde): No bobbin listed but. Needles found
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *progress*

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Noice!!
Anna (loud and likely blonde): THANK
Anna (loud and likely blonde): word of advice to others attempting. 
There is literally no way in the manga that thing stays on his face. Suggest elastic straps over back of head and top
Erik (Red Riot Thot): When you realize it's almost midnight and your sewwing machine is probably disturbing your parents trying to sleep so you resort to manually cranking your sewing machine to finish what you're working on
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I'm sorry I keep reacting F to your messages but like. 
Press f to pay respects
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *one (1) hand cramp later...*

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): homestuck
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *no*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): listen i survived without ever homestuck cosplaying
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theres still time
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *no*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *u either get me as ur Adora or a homestuck*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *and i know u want an Adora*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): adora
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i didnt even read homestuck
Marisa (Mawisa): homestuck?
Marisa (Mawisa): pinged by homestuck
Marisa (Mawisa): bne group read of homestuck
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *leanna have i just been ASSUMING you've read homestuck what*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how did you let me do this
Marisa (Mawisa): its a fair assumption
assume everyone has read homestuck until proven otherwise
that's how the us court system operates
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): doxx the homestucks!
Marisa (Mawisa): he's just jealous he hasn't read it yet
Anna (loud and likely blonde): to be fair im like. schrodingers homestuck. I read all of it but do i remember any of it? Questionable.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): to be fair. i wish i could be hella jeff bc that was the best thing to ever come out of homestuck
Marisa (Mawisa): do you remember why jade has narcolepsy
i remember there was a reason behind it but not why. and she lost it later in the series? i think? because condy or something was using her or idk
Jamie (Jamie): Main thing i remember clearly is being dissapointed by the ending cause...cop out and loose strings glaore
Marisa (Mawisa): yyeah that was rushed
and we still don't have the second chapter of the game
Marisa (Mawisa): i think the ending and the game got messed up because the kickstarter money was all stolen
Marisa (Mawisa): and caused hussie lots of stress
Jamie (Jamie): Oof didnt know it got stolen big yikes
Marisa (Mawisa): oh yeah!!
Marisa (Mawisa): that's why the game was YEARS late and only one part is out
Jamie (Jamie): That was hella lot of money too
Marisa (Mawisa): the people behind King's Quest were supposed to make the game, but they took it and used it towards a new king's quest instead while all they made for hussie was an empty room and some sprites.
Jamie (Jamie): Tell me he sued the hell out of them
Marisa (Mawisa): so hussie salvaged whatever money he could and learned how to make a video game himself, and with his most trusted people and WhatPumpkin's support they began making the game themselves
Marisa (Mawisa): i think they tried
Marisa (Mawisa): lemme find
Jamie (Jamie): I do recall now hearing he was doing it himself now that i think on it
Marisa (Mawisa): remember when the kickstarter became the #1 funded thing of all time because it reached $2.4 million
good times
Jamie (Jamie): Yea that was honestly amazing lol
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): <@289944569410224129> Those glasses are perfect for Wicke from Pokemon Sun and Moon.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): OH SHE CUTE
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that is a tiddies out outfit though
Marisa (Mawisa): here's the original post that brought the scandal to light
https://web.archive.org/web/20150704220422/http://ipgd.tumblr.com/post/123230861032/im-sure-that-everyone-has-noticed-by-now-that-the
Marisa (Mawisa): oo i know someone who cosplays a perfect wicke i could ask her how she did her glasses if you're doin' wicke
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I have a very similar pair cuz I intend to cosplay her ~~still haven't done it yet 2 years later lmao~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~mood~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): lol nah i dont need to make the glasses i just need mah prescription and like however much those cost. 
I need. to order red half frames. and. the site just HASNT RESTOCKED THEM
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Oof. That's rough buddy. But I know that feel
Anna (loud and likely blonde): U n me. cries in lack of vision
Marisa (Mawisa): if i remember correctly i think hussie was unable to sue them because of something in the contract between them, and the legal fees would eat up all the rest of the money that should've gone into the game, and the lawsuit would last years
Jamie (Jamie): Yikes that really sucks and prolly a good example of why you always read every bit of those sort of contracts
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yikes

Also I never finishes Homestuck. I got to where the Gigapause started and never picked it back up when it ended.
Jamie (Jamie): I forget when i dropped it but it was like a year after the end I was told it actually ended and decided to binge through what i had missed
Marisa (Mawisa): have you seen the game content? what's out so far is really good. it's just a shame it's taking so long.
Marisa (Mawisa): and all the fans left during the gigapause when the drama was happening
Marisa (Mawisa): i saw some hiveswap cosplayers at katsu tho!
