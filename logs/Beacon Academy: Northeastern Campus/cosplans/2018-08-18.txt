Rebecca (madameterralupus): Which garment? Her main base or?
Jess (whoozica): I think it's a hakama? I got a similar outfit to hers for another cosplay but I think that's what it's called
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm not 100% sure. The wiki just says a dress is what she wears. But mine is like a kimono style top and skirt. With the corset obi wrap
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ever slow progress but we getting there 👌🏻
Tom (tomukuncosplay): NICU,where are you doing the wood work?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's mostly my dad doing the wood work cause I'm bad at working with wood, he's done it for years. But we do it all in our workshop in the basement 🤗
