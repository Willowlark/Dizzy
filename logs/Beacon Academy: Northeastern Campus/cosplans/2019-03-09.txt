Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Also I kinda want to color the roots to have some brown in it like his hair. What do ya'll suggest as the easiest method?~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Let me channel my inner Leanna hang on
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Channel your inner Leanna XDD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): She's gonna say root it with alchohol markers
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof. I wonder if we have them at work ~~I think we do?~~ 
Do they bleed easily? I'm scared of it bleeding and messing something up XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeah artist loft and copics and prismacolor are all alchohol markers 
And no not unless you clean it with isopropyl alchohol will it come off.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahh okay. We got shit like that. Also checked our site and we do. I just couldn't recall what brands were LOL. And ooohh okay. I just worry XD I may try that out then 🤔
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Plus you can control where you put it easily
Anna (loud and likely blonde): MOOD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Probs won't do that for a while though lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Idk when I plan to wear or finish this costume XD Just kinda buying pieces as I can lol.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u can also if you wanna test it rub eyeshadow or contour powder  in the roots
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Apparently a way to make lacefront look more real is if u eyeshadow the roots so I tested it once n it works on other wig parts too
