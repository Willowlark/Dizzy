Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oops the dye from the feathers bled when washing it xD thankfully this is the inside... but it did go through to the other side a little... oh well ðŸ˜…
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oh no!
Erik (slendergiant): oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): baTTLE DAMAGE
Erik (slendergiant): singe marks
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yup, battle damage is cool.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thankfully it's not as bad as this on the other side. But yea I'm thinking i could just call it like battle damage or dirt from fighting xD 
Also thank god it's black and not another color. Cause still goes with the color scheme she has ðŸ˜«
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Aaaaah SHIT. you know fought NGDO?

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If you get NDGO Erik I sooooo want <@143910209738244096> â€˜s SSSN.
Erik (slendergiant): Meg told me once that if I got a GB NDGO together, she'd try to get a full GB SSSN together as well xD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): FUCK YES.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This realization in part from listening to the OST for the fight; and that I kinda highkey want to dabble with fight choreography. At first for fun, then for better action stills, and then if Iâ€™m already doing the sequence for the best stills... why not record it?
Erik (slendergiant): Bill's next venture: cosplay music videos
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Yo
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): If you wanna do fight choreography hmu
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeAH THATD BE COOL
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): I used to do it all the time as part of my demonstration team
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Its rough to design in costumes but its super fun
