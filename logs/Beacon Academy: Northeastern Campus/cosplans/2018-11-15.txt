Jess (whoozica): oo i also need to know this
Halim (Greg): ~~one of us one of us~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ i mean stars butterfly form kinda looks like the god tier homestucks so...~~
Halim (Greg): Anybody else remember that awkward time when Hetalia was so big that people started to get into Homestuck because they were tired of all the Hetalia
but then Homestuck became so big that it annoyed people and they went back to Hetalia 
and then there was a lowkey highkey fandom war between the two
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): unfortunately i was a sideliner for that mess
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i literally witnessed it happen like a fly on the wall
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I was one of those people lmao.~~
Jess (whoozica): i wasnt into cosplay yet XD
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): same
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was into Hetalia first then jumped into the fandom of Homestuck for a small bit cause my friends at the time were all into it as well XD
Halim (Greg): it wasn't super a cosplay thing more like  tumblr
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That was probably when I was just getting into cosplay because the people I knew were big into Homestuck and/or Hetalia
Halim (Greg): ~~I sat in both camps and was like lol wheres the popcorn~~
Halim (Greg): ~~just like to watch the world burn~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): circa 2014ish I'm guessing?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i somehow havent seen a single episode of hetalia or read any homestuck... how did i escape that time period like that
Halim (Greg): a little earlier
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol. You got lucky Leanna?? Looking back at all that stuff at the time I'm like...OOF

Jess (whoozica): ME TOO LEANNA
Jess (whoozica): oh wait thats not true
Jess (whoozica): i tried to start homestuck once
