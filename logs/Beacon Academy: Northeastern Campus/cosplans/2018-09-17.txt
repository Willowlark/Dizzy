Rebecca (madameterralupus): Do em aaallll~!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The school uniform is on sale 
Oh I will! Just idk who@to do first
meghan (meghan): I‚Äôd say do one of the students first, that way you can just buy the school uniform and switch out the wigs for multiple cosplays!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That‚Äôs the plan kinda. So then it‚Äôs down to Momo, Ochako, and Tsu
Erik (slendergiant): ‚òùüèª
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm that'd be a smart idea.  üòÉ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The uniform is on sale on Miccostumes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So I might buy it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think you'd make a hella good Momo~ (Although you'd be perf at all of em tbh üòõ )
meghan (meghan): Well put it this way, do you want to deal with an easy wig, a stupid hair bow or a ponytail wig?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I LOVE MOMO AND TODAMOMO IS MY GODDAMN SHIP. 

Kasou has pre-styled wigs for all 3 girls

Rebecca (madameterralupus): *a stupid hairbow* I love the description of Froppy's hair. I mean it is accurate XD
meghan (meghan): I originally planned on cosplaying tsu so I bought all the materials and figured out the logistics of making her wig and I can tell you ITS A STUPID HAIR BOW üòÇ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I know people who have done the hair thing. Half the reason I‚Äôm like ‚Äúidk about Tsu as much as I love her‚Äù
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm XD Her hair is what's holding me back from cosplaying her too. Cause oof what the hell is that XD
meghan (meghan): It‚Äôs a relatively simple process just HELLA time consuming
Jess (whoozica): low key wanna do mina but body paint and full scleras and being blind is not appealing to me üò≠
meghan (meghan): PLS DO MINA
meghan (meghan): a goal of mine is to one point have a full bakusquad but no one ever wants to be Mina and Sero üò≠
