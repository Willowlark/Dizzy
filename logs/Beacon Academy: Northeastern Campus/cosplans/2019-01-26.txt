Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Get petroleum jelly and put it on the skin around your hairline
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Otherwise itll dye your skin
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Especially important for black dye
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also on your ears
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Might go for a very dark brown instead of black
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Still, dark colors stain like a bitch
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Truth
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Schwartzkoff is a good brand
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): You can get it at walmart, works really well and doesnt damage tour hair a lot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>

Jess (whoozica): Yea we're doing MysMe Sunday morning-ish were all doing characters from Ray's route
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~isn’t Jumin... not in Ray’s route?~~
Jess (whoozica): Mmmm not really? Like he is but he takes more of a side roll in that route, doesn't really interact with Tom's or Marisa's characters
Jess (whoozica): MysMe is a mess 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That may make photos non canon.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~fuck it tho~~
Jess (whoozica): I'm sure people would still be hype to see the four of us like walking around as a group tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Katsu’s white marble walls are perfect for Jumin solos. Wear him anyway, we can get you new photos for your bumble.
Jess (whoozica): OoOo yYEA the Gaylord is Rich boi heaven
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But isn't Jaehee still Jumin's assistant regardless?
Marisa (Mawisa): i'm cosplaying ray and jaehee lol
