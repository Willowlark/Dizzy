Georgia (Something Sensible): Henlo friends where can I find a good Spider-Man suit that doesn’t look cheap and bad
Georgia (Something Sensible): For REASONS 👀
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like actual main Spider-Man . Not another Spidey person?
Mark (Mad Doctor): We did Zentaizone. They always do good work. Is this a Noah thing...?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s what the eyes means yes.
Georgia (Something Sensible): INDEED he said he would wear it AND do a photoshoot if he or I didn’t pay for it
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I’m just gonna give the money to other people ;3c
Georgia (Something Sensible): _loopholes_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s a weird stipulation.
Georgia (Something Sensible): He doesn’t wanna pay for it (duh it’s not his hobby) and he doesn’t want me to pay for it (idk how to rationalize that one)
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not that you’ve been recently but a cosplayer paying for a shoot isn’t exactly weird.
Mark (Mad Doctor): If he plans on wearing the mask for longer than 20 minutes at a time, Audrey recommends the eyes that are permeable. Hers weren't, and she had trouble w fog. A fellow Spidey gave the tip
Mark (Mad Doctor): She also wished she had removeable gloves for cell phone use.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s just a mood.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh not the shoot, the cosplay
Georgia (Something Sensible): He wants the suit sans facemask so he can go full Andrew Garfield
Georgia (Something Sensible): _i was like tom Holland better but ok_
Mark (Mad Doctor): Only fair if you're gwen
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~so he’s suggesting you should make it? your time is more valuable than the cost of the zentai~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh yeah he saw I was shopping for Gwen suits so he went “you know what”
Georgia (Something Sensible): He assumes I’m not crafty enough to find a loophole and yet, loophole found
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s. Not a loophole. You’re still spending your money on it.
Georgia (Something Sensible): If I give someone 20 dollars and then they conveniently drop it in my kofi, the ownership changed to them
Georgia (Something Sensible): 👉😎👉
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cunning as a fox with a degree in Cunning Sudies from Cunning University
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~your kofi account is still yours~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I get what shes doing lol..
Rebecca (madameterralupus): . ~~Although you could just get it for him for a big bday gift or xmas gift??~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): No good. Action is his reward
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Hey someone borrow a crisp 20 from Georgia and accidentally drop it in her kofi
Georgia (Something Sensible): So we can _convert him_
Erik (Red Riot Thot): New Tai wig. Not super happy with the color, but it was the best one that wasn't on backorder. But I love the waves and the ease of messy styling I can do
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ooo I like!
Georgia (Something Sensible): Arda magnum?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Arda Hansel in Champagne
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like it too! 😮 I think it looks pretty good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I guess I'm used to the more bleach blonde look, but it'll probably look better with everything together
Matt (mattmyers25): I like it. It is a good color
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh I love that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Gonna order new contacts probably tomorrow
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The shading of the fibers gives it dimension
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Hopefully they work this time 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Agreed Leanna
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Looks rlly nice and easily tousled.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 Should I wear Sun, Holo or a Macadamia Nut on Fri of Zenkai??
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I kinda want to do Sun but worried it be too cold lol~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Yes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I am assuming your yes means do all... and lol no XD~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If it help, the BNHA shoot is Friday, soooo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 Hmmm.. I shall keep this in mind lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I mean I didn't get any Denki pics soo would be smart to wear him again~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): What IS everyone thinkin for Zenkai
Marisa (Mawisa): emma becuz i can wear my staff shirt over her and she was the most popular thing i wore at katsu

Jess (whoozica): i have noooo clue
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Probably Kiri on Friday and Blake on Saturday. Maybe I'll do Tai during the day on Friday if it's chilly
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Gonna do Starbucks at some point
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Thinking of pulling out ozpin again and might do kaminari or kiri depending on if I get my wig in time and i can make it look good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im really gonna try to get ozmas tunic and pants done
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and will prob bring penny
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not sure about anything else
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m getting a lot of love on Instagram for Starfire so I’m pretty heavily considering that for Friday
Georgia (Something Sensible): Saturday I’ll likely do Weiss, and pull our Pyrrha for the formal cause I miss dat bitch
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sunday is idk, I wanna do spidergwen but I don’t think it’s financially smart
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So far...
Fri: ??
Sat: Blake Season 4
Sun: Ed Elric
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Trying not to do anything new cause I need to save monies. So rewearing old stuff and just fixing that up.~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ochako was fun at the formal to be a meme tho 🤔 idk
Georgia (Something Sensible): What a mood
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wanna make something new cause my con schedule is so unsure
Georgia (Something Sensible): But I needs to be relatively easy and not much more than 100 bucks
Anna (loud and likely blonde): hey uhhhhhh so cosplay halp pls. 
anyone good with electronics or like. disassembling stuff. 
If i took apart a megaphone and shortened the funnel part do you think it would still amplify noise
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): It should, mabey not as much though
Anna (loud and likely blonde): excellent. I am not looking for clarity but more like. amplify loud
Georgia (Something Sensible): Noah says it should still work but not as well
Anna (loud and likely blonde): litty.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~because i was 2 points away from failing electronics so this is gonna be fun~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): guys
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what fabric do you think realistically Ozmas tan undershirt would be?

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): http://lipstickgiraffe.tumblr.com/post/182916005822/soldieroflandbozmas-task
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Probs just some simple form of cotton?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): rebecca i dead typed the exact same thing and never hit enter im dying.

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Great minds think alike?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): <3
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~broke~~ great minds think alike
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im gonna go with a thin textured linen
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i went to buy fabric for just blakes robe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but ended up:

Anna (loud and likely blonde): leannaaaaaaaa im going crazy imma make grimm penny for rtx so i only have to bring one red and black dress to texas
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LmAO youre gonna make another grimm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): bless your soul
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i meannnnnn i can reuse like. half my stuffs. Plus im already sewing a black and red penny dress for Steam penny so i may as well reuse it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~you're making ozma and like gurllllll all that detail????~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~oh true i forgot about steampenny~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~im also making my life difficult with ozma by not going light on the detail... even if the tunic will be covered by armor later~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea like i can reuse the grimm nails and basically all just spikes and accessories. im just gonna make a separate shirt for grimm penny
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~mood~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~silhouettecosplay style~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~YES~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm still so upset I didn't get a photo with them as Tai... She and sennedjem were my inspiration for redoing Tai. My revamp still isn't on their level (not that I expect it to be) but it was still inspiring to try to put more care and effort into my work
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I walked past them after changing from Tai into Kirishima and was like FUCK
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Silhouettecosplay is honestly Raven goals for me ❤
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like dammnnn 👌
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i met them as penny and they got really excited over the lights it was really fucking wholesome
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so now im like "gotta make silhouette and sennedjem proud"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~maybe next time I'll attempt a shirt from scratch~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~but having a mannequin would probably be necessary~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): would a female mannequin still work if I could get one that adjusts to my measurements?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i recommend making a duct tape one
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): female mannequins have tiddies
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah that's the only issue...
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~excuse to get swole for pecks~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): help me make a duct tape body form sometime? 😅
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea i gotchu fam
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): duct tape mannequin making party
Anna (loud and likely blonde): would also suggest getting a coat rack to put it on
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh count me in for making a duct tape mannequin cause I've been meaning to do that lol.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I will help tape ppl bc i made my mom buy me an adjustable mannequin for xmas lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i have ... a lot of mannequins, but i also will help tape people
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~also if you want an adjustable female mannequin, I have been able to find several on facebook marketplace and other online garage sale apps for extremely cheap. i have 2 adjustable ones now and 1 standard one and one plush one that you can stick pins into for draping~~
ZombieHunter: I need a boy one
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i have been looking for one for you actually
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): God, I hope I have enough room to set aside money for a dressform from my tax return. I need one so bad so I can finally build up the courage to start Rosalina and other gown cosplans
Anna (loud and likely blonde): we shall help scour the interwebs
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I saw the cricut recently put out the holo vinyl in iron on form so I was like I need to start soon ~~I've only been sitting on this fabric for a year~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i want a cricut so bad
Anna (loud and likely blonde): SO BAD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Cuz I want to go all out and do those star at the train of her dress like in Smash.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): And omg mood
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Too bad they're like $200-$400
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ordered new contacts for Tai and Blake ~~hopefully they work this time~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i feel so bad yall struggle with contacts so bad
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I spent an extra $1.40 for faster shipping so I can be disappointed quicker <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the yellow ones for Blake I'm not too worried about because I feel they'll look good with brown eyes regardless because they're in that similar color range. It's always the blue I'm worried about, but the customer review photos seem to look pretty good
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Jess's brown looked amazing.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): agreed
Marisa (Mawisa): so anime
Erik (Red Riot Thot): much brown
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <@!351471675843411978> what brown ones did you get? 👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i need brown for ozma
Jess (whoozica): oh uhhh they were from honeycolor i forget the name ill try to find out for you though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thank! <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Jess (whoozica): https://honeycolor.com/max-elegance-tri-tone-brown
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thank you!!!!!!!
Jess (whoozica): No prob 👍 I got the blue ones too but they area little too dark
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~my megaphone has been ordered~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): as well as 200 metal spikes
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): The gold ones of that series are pretty great too. That's what I used for my original Kali lenses. They're a bit on the understated side, if you want more not bright yellow eyes. Retired them cuz they ran out of my prescription last I checked and I want my eyes to pop a bit more as Kali.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): That feel when you're still exhausted from Katsu but you need to start on this beast of a queen bitch for Zenkaikon
