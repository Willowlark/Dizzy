Rebecca (madameterralupus): Someone recommended me something a while back that was like plastidip but was harder/not as flexible? What was the name of it again? Someone I know is looking for something liek it but I cant recall the name of the product >.<
Anna [Cyborg]: Is it in a spray can?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I dont really know XD
I just recall it being not as flexible like plastidip. More sturdy or whatever. But I assume t would be if basically like plastidip?
Anna [Cyborg]: Uhhh I know flexseal makes a sprayable one
Anna [Cyborg]: It's way thicker than plasti or flexidip
Anna [Cyborg]: I've decided my next investment will be an embroidery machine if in the near future anyone needs things embroidered.
