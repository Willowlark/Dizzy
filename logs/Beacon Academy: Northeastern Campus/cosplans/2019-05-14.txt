Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need to find a liner for it but oof they so damn expensive... may see if I can borrow instead >.>
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Try a hardhat liner?
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: It'll have suspension in it. U might have to like. Hot glue the buckles tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Idk if it'll work or fit properly lol. I can look into it though if can't borrow one lol
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: oh also. ebay.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: so due to me taking a joke too far once again. im debating making an escalator waifu cosplay. just so i can walk up to ppl with huge trailing cosplay and go 'ur cape looks tasty'
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: This is a terrible idea and it's happening
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Thank you all for putting up with me
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I have a design already
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Escalator waifu cosplay... omg XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I love it
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Going like. For a Toga vibe with the yandere. 
Im gonna make a skirt that looks like escalator steps and make a cropped jacket out of clear plastic and put all the hazard stickers on it. And make the cuffs of the sleeves look like the black hand rail thing. 
Walking around with a knife and fork
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I guess silver hair or something
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Or like. Caution yellow maybe. Make a belt out of caution tape
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: This is happening
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Idk when tho
