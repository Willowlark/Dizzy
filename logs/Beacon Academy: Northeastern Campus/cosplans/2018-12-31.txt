Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I decided I want to do a costume with no deadline that I can work on little by little thing year when feeling down, stressed or etc. A person I know did this, kind of like a therapy costume. But I can't decide if I want to do Azula from ATLA or a Pyrrha remake 🤔
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~I vote Pyrrha remake but I’m bias~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm gonna try and gave Pyrrha again for Zenkai
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My will to make has revived thanks to my crafty roomie
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also got new fabric to make Summers cape again and I now know what I'm doing!!!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Once again my roommate is a blessing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Last time I did Pyrrha she was rushed and was my first time using worbla. Thus is why it came out so bad lol. So I think if I took her under as this therapy costume thing I wanna do and took my time it'd come out a lot better. 🤔
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeet
