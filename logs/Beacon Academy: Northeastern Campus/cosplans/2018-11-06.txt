Possibly Ochako and maybe Sherry Birkin

Evie (Katheryne Knight): PJ Winter redux

Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~Id do Bishamon but I don’t have her outfit~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ooooh, expand the noragami circle.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m really trying to avoid doing anything new new that I don’t already own and haven’t worn it that I’m currently making
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Good idea.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They still need a Yukine too.
Jess (whoozica): https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01EKTQA8C?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_pd_title

These are the pants but apparently the 1 stripe isn't available in the jacket anymore 😭
Jess (whoozica): It was so hard to find a single stripe track suit
Marisa (Weeb): every single cosplayer i know here tapes their face. i see in the changing rooms that everybody puts tape on before makeup and after the wig net. it goes from their cheek/jawline to the top of their wig net. is that just a japan thing or do US cosplayers use tape too?
Marisa (Weeb): i want to try it but that seems a bit unhealthy to have your skin pulled back all day
Jamie (Jamie): I've seen that before but mostly notice it with the asian cosplayers. I have been tempted to try it just to get the mature slim lady face for some character compared to my usual baby face lol
Jess (whoozica): I feel like I'd just get my hair stuck in the tape
Marisa (Weeb): oo that's why it goes after the wig cap!

that's interesting, I wonder how it got started and became such a common thing. i guess just normal makeup trends.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: o:
Jess (whoozica): I have sideburns 😭
Marisa (Weeb): tape your sideburns for *maximum cosplay*
Marisa (Weeb): tape everything. just wrap yourself up as a mummy for *maximum cosplay*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I agree with Jess I feel I'd get my hair stuck in it. Even with the wig cap on xD 
Also feel after time so much pulling of the skin is gonna make your skin sag/wrinkle more when older 🤔
Jess (whoozica): Yea right? That's what I was thinking
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH that's what I was curious about! i'm sure they use special skin tape but some people really pull back a lot i get worried
Jess (whoozica): Ok so I got my pink contacts in and they came with it her pink contacts for free, the ones I got are opaque (bot over the pupil or anything though( and the free ones were more of the mesh type. I have light green eyes to so the mesh ones just look brown from a distance cuz the oink and green kinda just mix together
you want fucking rwby chibi?: funky
Jess (whoozica): I'm glad I went with the full color ones tho cuz I was debating whether to get those or the mesh ones in the first place
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I think for Kon Kon iI'm going tp do Denki Kaminari in a reindeer onsie 🤔 
Idk what else would be fitting for him to wear XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You need to have Christmas lights wrapped around you because electricity
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg yes. Catch me buying up ALL the christmas lights at work lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay so reindeer onsie with christmas lights XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Pls
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Imma do it now XD
But if imma have christmas lights do I stick with reindeer or do something tree related? (if can find anything)
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *Let's get lit* XD
you want fucking rwby chibi?: hfhfhfhfhhf
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i could put ornaments in my hair as deku bc,,, green hair=tree-like,,,
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I cant decide between aizawa and denki
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You should do Aizawa and get one of those big ass stockings to wear in place of his sleeping bag XD
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Jfc that would be ridiculous 
I love it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): My only problem with aizawa is I'd need to buy a wig too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): i could lend you the wig i was using for him 😮
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Mmmmmm tempting 
Imma get back to you on that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I think I'm gonna do bakugo as scrooge
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Perfect
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I didnt realize how close it was this year so, no time to make anything. I'll just buy a scrooge outfit LOL
you want fucking rwby chibi?: im probably gonna do something like this but make it more xmas-y
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i, need deku shoes tho bc i dont think my red converse will really. do it anymore
$$$ \:'D
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I was thinking of making a Christmas version of bakuhoes hero suit to wear under the matching sweater Erik and I are going to get. Should I make his granades??? I wanna do his real hero suit eventually anyway so I’d be able to use them for that as well
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Use ornaments
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Makr his grenades but use tree ornament balls
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ayyyy hal same thought
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I hate both of you that’s an awful idea
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Don’t tempt me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Make them either look like ornament maybe or decorate them with ornaments to look like a tree since green 🤔
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Wait
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): What if
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ayyy leanna same pageed
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Present fists
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): YES
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Christmas baubles was what I was thinking as well 😂
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Wait so I'm thinking
Erik (Red Riot Thot): BUT PRESENTS ARE GOOD TOO
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Delibird x Bakugou
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): What does that mean
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Delibird is a pokemon that carrys e's gifts
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): That usually explode
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Since I'm not doing bare chest anymore, I think I'm still going to do my Christmas wreath gears idea
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Also when you guys say ornaments do you mean like have one giant Christmas ornament on each fist or a bunch of small ones out together??
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): A bunch of small ones for his little grenades
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): And then either presents or big ones for fists
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): YOU COULD DO BELLS TOO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was thinking one giant one. Or since his are originally green doing a bunch of small ones to make it look like a tree.So kinda both
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I’m going to go through my moms Christmas decorations and see what I can steal. The goal is to spend as little money on this as possible. I’m hoping to only have to buy the wig, pants and sweater
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I hope to do the same, spend as little as possible. Although for my plan I only have the wig so far 😅 Hopefully I can find some cheap supplies at work to make it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ok so separate topic but 
<@327835140216586242>  <@386874959009415170>  
When are we all getting together with zombievriska in what I hope is a kirisquad in that disgusting flannel
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I have my Christmas colored fairy lights from last year if anyone wants to use them!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I also still have my light up candy cane too if anyone wants to use it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cause I just need my paycheck and I'm buying it
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I know zombie is planning a whole outfit for it at katsu
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Mine's arriving Thursday <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I get paid on Friday and I’m going to the mall after I get my hair done 👌🏻👌🏻
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@288513265661902858> would you believe they didn't put those shirts out on the floor at the two (2) locations I went to?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): They weren’t on the floor at zombies store either, she had to order it online
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I guess your store is the only one bold enough to put those out on display 😂
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Apparently 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The guy I asked was like "I'm pretty sure I've seen those in the back, but we haven't entered them into our system yet so I can't get it for you"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Rude
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): That's rood
