Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I cant find it~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh fuck I'm an idiot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Nanotips
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Not micro
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Gotta look into those for my flight suit
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Was going to just stitch some conductive thread into the fingertips otherwise
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It works pretty well but it takes a while to dry and it smells REALLY bad when applying
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I have a mighty fucking need
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): WOW nanotios are completely sold out.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nanotips.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Fuck me.
Marisa (Mawisa): Try AnyGlove itâ€™s pretty similar
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Twenty bucks hmmu
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://www.facebook.com/groups/katsucon2017photos/permalink/2267872640161666/ did you guys in the katsu franxx group see this? Maybe you can borrow the ones you're missing from them.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Welp, guess I know what I'm wearing Thursday now
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *oh* I misread it, I thought they had everyone except Zero Two, Nana and Ichigo.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Which in hindsight makes no sense.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lol yeah, they're looking for people for their group. Zero Two and Ichigo make sense since they're the more commonly cosplayed. The girl who's organizing it is doing Nana which is neato because I don't think I've seen anyone cosplay her before
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~*Now I finally have a use for the uniform I bought lol*~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~tempted to actually buy the darlifra uniform thats been in my cart for over 2 months~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~do it~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~buy it a couple sizes bigger and then stuff it with a pillow for baby bump~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ˜‚ ~~ shit dude, you right i better~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): "I got pregnant because I've always dreamed of a large, loving family"
"I got pregnant for the cosplay potential"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omfg ðŸ˜‚
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~no one can deny how cute a kid cosplaying with their parents is~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey can
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): found a darlifra uniform in my size on ebay for 20 bucks LMAO guess im doing kokoro
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~it even comes with the socks with the garters xD~~
Jess (whoozica): damn good buy
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need to make the sock garters still
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): just saved myself like 40 dollars
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEET
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I decided to start making my Katsu lineup graphic but I actually have a lot so it feels so cluttered xD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): sounds about right.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh mood, i am avoiding making mine because of that fact
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's something I should probably work on but idk what I am doing Thursday still. And still on the fence about Wukong for Sunday XD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): who needs line up posts <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Jess (whoozica): i dont know that im doing thursday
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was debating on doing Veronica again but ðŸ¤·
Jess (whoozica): i might so mysmess with marisa cuz im trash ~~even though we are doing that sunday~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Was she doing mymess then?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I just remember Maki.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I can keep track of almost anyone's lineup except Marisa's~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Lol I'd see about joining that DarliFa Thurs group too but they already got an Ichigo. Woops~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): doesn't hurt to ask.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~It'd save me an extra costume to pack lol! Wonder if I have a wig that could work for Ikuno or Miku. Hmm~~
Jess (whoozica): oh maybe she is idk i can barely keep track of myself
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@!169297844874903552> do Ikuno so then you don't have to take your glasses off lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Honestly that's a reason why it's tempting XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~A cosplay I can see in?! A fucking miracle.~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Maybe I'll make my lineup post as a set and do one day per image lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I often forget you can post multiple images in one post
Matt (mattmyers25): Do they need a hiro for the darling group Thursday?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye
Matt (mattmyers25): I could be hiro
