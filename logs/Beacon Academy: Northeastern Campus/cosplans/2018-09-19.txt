Mark (Mad Doctor): Neptune and Sun would wear Crocs ironically. Jaune because they're practical, and Ya g because she DGAF

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "they're so light and incredible for combat!"

Mark (Mad Doctor): Ren would wear them to the shower only, and he would arrange them neatly in the show rack at the foot of his bed
