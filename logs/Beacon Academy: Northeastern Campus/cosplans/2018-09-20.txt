Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shit Iâ€™m hella tempted to try and do Pyrrha 3.0...
It just depends on if I wanna save that for like...another big con or something.
Might just work on it little by little and then have it ready when itâ€™s ready.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I saw the finished design and I nneeeeeeed it so we can cry about it together gen
Evie (Katheryne Knight): PLease
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I think itâ€™s going to be one of those things I work on little by little and it will be done when itâ€™s done. 

Like if I even TRY to start t now Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to regret it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Especially since I havenâ€™t rebuilt normal Pyrrha yet
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And Iâ€™m working on Summer and wanting to do other cosplays
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Iâ€™m prob going to work on it slowly as well, Iâ€™m making my first bunnysuit for ausa so Iâ€™m hoping Iâ€™ll be able to alter the pattern Iâ€™m using for that to be able to make Pyrrha.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): But that armor has me DROOLING
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I need to still do Bunnysuit Winter...and oof hopefilly I can get Cheerleader Winter in
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also being in My Hero Hell now I want to cosplah all of that

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh also I want to do Fantasy Yaoyorozu because UMPH
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That. Fucking. Outfit. Slays. Me.

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): SO MUCH YES TO ALL OF THESE THINGS
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): idk if Iâ€™ll start working on 3.0 Pyrrha until after katsu because I want to take my time with her
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Have I mentioned I love Momo and the episode with her and Todoroki killed me on how much I relate to her so ducking michb

Basically me girl. Iâ€™m starting her after Katsu ~~unless he releases a full body winter~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): if she turns out well then I may try to enter her into my first competition
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Iâ€™m praying he does full body winter
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~what does Pyrrha have against real pants tho~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): FUCK PANTS

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~and now you have it~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~isn't that nice~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof temoted to change my KoFi goal to this.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The gun and the fact that she has some kinda tony stark machine in her spear hole are the best details.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But people already donated to Loki and I feel bad
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn even I'm tempted to cosplay this version of her lol :O
But I gotta redo her normal version first lmfao
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof same but like
I hate myself and Iâ€™d rather do this XD 
Cause RIFLE
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I am LIVING for hair down Pyrrha
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The leg armor and shoes are the same really, you've already got that part Meg.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Nope Iâ€™m making new one
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hair down is a nice touch cause oof fuck ponytail wigs XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah they are definitely different
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): The small differences would drive me CRAZY
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Does that start a new counter or go off the old one? ðŸ˜†
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): FUCK
Erik (slendergiant): d-d-d-DAYUM
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Guess it'll depend on how much use you get out of the variant.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Itâ€™s new so I know Iâ€™ll wear it a lot
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly I feel you Meghan
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Iâ€™m the same way
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Iâ€™ve worn Pyrrha almost 20times so far
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The small differences throw me off
Itâ€™s almost the same build but slightly more detailed
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Exactly**
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): But I do really like that the kneecaps are smaller
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Thatâ€™ll make walking in the armor a little easier
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^*^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cause that would be fucking nice
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): RIGHT
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I may actually be able to sit in this set of armor
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ya know 
You could make it so that the knee comes a lil higher so you could sit. Thatâ€™s what happened for me XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Iâ€™m NOT remaking her old armor again so nope
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Mood tho
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Iâ€™ll live ðŸ˜‚
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I need to remake that damn corset ugh
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I have to fix it up in some areas but Iâ€™m not complete remaking it
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): The armor that is
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thatâ€™s totally fair
Erik (slendergiant): Unrelated question: Anyone have experience with dental veneers for cosplay?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yes
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I bought a pair for kiri and I hated them
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): What are you looking to use them for
Erik (slendergiant): Kiri ðŸ˜‚
Jess (whoozica): like fangs?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Full mouth set for kiri
Erik (slendergiant): https://tinsleytransfers.com/cannibal-teeth-fx/
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He has shark teeth
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Is it supposed to be like, a corset/bunnysuit?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Cause that doesn't sound comfortable. More than corsets usually don't sound comfortable.
Jess (whoozica): ooo ok i only have fangs
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I bought these and they look good but you canâ€™t smile in them
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They look annoying ðŸ˜¦
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And kiri is ALWAYS smiling
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like idk if I could stand that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And I know I gotta figure out gangs for Toga XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Another thing Iâ€™ve seen ppl do but I havenâ€™t tried yet it buying a teeth marker. Then you just draw on your teeth to make them look pointed
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah also it doesn't seem like you can talk easily with them in as well so I was debating whether they'd be worth it or not
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah that requires too much work  lol
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Thatâ€™s what this person does for kiri
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm I've seen people use tooth paint to make the shark teeth look. Not sure how well it is but probs deff more comfortable lol
Jess (whoozica): you just need regualr fangs for toga right <@!229713389511901185> ?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I also have vampire fangs that I used for zero two and they were really easy to wear/talk in so I may wear those the next time Iâ€™m kiri
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah cause she had lil fangs
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!351471675843411978>
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): If your buying fangs is reccomend not buy over the size 13mm otherwise itâ€™s hard to close your mouth
Jess (whoozica): <@!351785752197201920>  link a gurl
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cause eventually Chris and I are gonna do a LoV squad
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YOHEE Cosplay 13mm Vampire Teeth Dentures Halloween Party Props Fangs https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZZ7NGNJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_907OBbYD9CSEZ
Jess (whoozica): the ones tom and i have you make a lil mold for your teeth and then you can reuse them with no adhesive
Evie (Katheryne Knight): AWESOME!!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ugh Iâ€™m stoked to get my Ochako cosplay in tomorrow
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Iâ€™ll be sure to try and take some selfies
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I canâ€™t wait to be my lil bean
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And I have the school uniform now so I can buy a Momo wig and do Momo and get Chris to be Todoroki with me XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh i have those fangs for mavis ðŸ˜‚
Jess (whoozica): I think  they are Scarecrow brand
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have the scarecrow brand fangs. I haven't ever used them though but will be this weekend, molding them tonight finally after having them for like 5 fucking years XDD Hoping they work okay lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay Iâ€™ll have to remember that. Cause thereâ€™s other characters with fangs I wanna do
Jess (whoozica): they work great for us!
Jess (whoozica): the molding paste doesn't taste too great so try to not get it on your tounge XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Noted!!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I hear they are pretty good lol. And oof good to know, I'll try my best not to XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also talking about BNHA I might be selling some wigs soon so hopefully I can also get my school uniform too~ <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I got mine off Amazon Prime. Same with the Ochako wig. There were good reviews for both items which is nice, and it was only 80 bucks total 

I ordered a size up from what I usually order because Chinese sizing. Hoping it works out ^_*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Imma probs get mine from Miccostumes since I get most of my costumes there (and Jamie plans to get her's there too so we can match pretty well lol).
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Nice!
I like MicCostumes. I got my Rinoa Heartilly cosplay there. It fits like a glove
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I ordered medium too
Jess (whoozica): yea miccostumes is pretty good! everything we have from them we like
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanted to get my Juvia cosplah from there and then they discontunued it
Jess (whoozica): ðŸ˜­
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah we got the lil heart container fangs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ooof that sucks. I've had pretty good luck with them. I just hate that some of the costumes I want from them they don't have in my size or been sold out recently ðŸ˜­ Hopefully soon that changes.
I also really dig HelloCosplay ðŸ‘Œ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜© Welp went to go look at buying my wig for Denki and the one I wanted is on backorder now... Dammit.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah Hellocosplay is good too!
Marisa (Weeb): oh i use tooth black, it's like nail polish for your teeth i love it. it's minty and you can drink in them and even eat if you're super careful. even if it does come off while eating, just wipe your teeth with a napkin to dry them off and reapply it.

you can also make pointy teeth out of some fake nails and/or thermoplastic
Marisa (Weeb): don't use the tooth black wax stuff from a halloween store it's absolute junk
Marisa (Weeb): i recommend this
https://www.amazon.com/Mehron-Makeup-Special-Effects-Halloween/dp/B001TK55PU?th=1
Marisa (Weeb): or there's a better one but i can't remember the company and i haven't seen it sold in ages, but a makeup booth was selling it at last year's katsucon
Georgia (Something Sensible): I hate to say such a sin word in this chat
Georgia (Something Sensible): But homestuck tutorials exist for a lot of the troll teeth
Georgia (Something Sensible): That might be a good resource
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ham stSTEAK
