Erik (Red Riot Thot): Pirate Blake vibes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YES.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Genderbent pirate Blake with the heterochromatic eyes is definitely a future cosplan
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Every gym I've been to has rules on what you can wear there tho.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): like, no heels on the treadmill.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OH I WANNA DO the OG blake design when you do that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, I know I said I was gonna use my canvas boots, but I just said fuck it and bought new boots
Erik (Red Riot Thot): NOT THE $450 ONES THOUGH
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The these ones: https://www.shoes.com/demonia-bolt-330-mid-calf-combat-boot/860924/1911413
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and bless Honey for getting me 30% off so they were only like $62
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): those are niiiiiiiiice
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, I wanted to justify my purchase by buying something I could wear normally as well so I'll at least get more use out of them
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Also, bought a new jacket because the one I got, while very nice and soft and comfy, it's basically hoodie material and I'm nervous about painting on it. So I got one that already has the black waistband and is basically a windbreaker which should be easier to paint the emblem on: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JHYNH97/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ohh that looks sportier too
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yo those are nice boots 
and yeah that one also means you wont have to paint the waistband either
Erik (Red Riot Thot): exactly
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was going to use fabric markers for that so it doesn't get hard but that would have been really fucking tedious, probably would require a shit ton of markers, and then have the possibility of it running if it gets wet
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you def wanna put the windbreaker fabric in like an embroidery hoop/something to hold it taut though for the paint. I fucked up a jacket by not doing that.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): not sure if I'd be able to because it's like, the entire length of the jacket on the side
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'll just have to be extra careful
Anna (loud and likely blonde): or the ghetto version aka pinning it around a strip of cardboard
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that couuld work
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oof. dats a lot
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah and it's even less on her because she's got the crop top
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): She's a walking adidas ad.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *athleisure, it says. Athleisure.*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): gotta be comfy when you're running from an abusive ex
Anna (loud and likely blonde): at this point we all need to find one specific crafting skill/machine to use to help each other.
Whos gonna get the cricut and whos gonna get into silkscreening
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~wears athletic wear with high heeled knee high boots~*
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~that's what I was calling out before~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~red bottomed heeled boots.~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Didn't Jamie work for a silk screening place? lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that bitch is wearing louboutins with her addidas wear
Erik (Red Riot Thot): PURPLE BOTTOMED
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im now realizing the color setting on my monitor may be off
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): blue too low
Erik (Red Riot Thot): also it's a very bright purple so that may be why
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it's like, Barney purple
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I may buy new laces to incorporate that color into my boots
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you could also paint it on the inside of the heel, the whole half inch that shows
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was thinking that too lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but like, there's no point
Jess (whoozica): you could color the whole bottom part like this:
Marisa (Mawisa): omg does anyone remember when those amazon boots were the source of some mild Facebook con drama
