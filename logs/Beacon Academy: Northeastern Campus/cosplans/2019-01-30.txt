Jamie (Jamie): Thank you anime for the wonders of clashing colors with character outfits. But also visual is coming along nice i think ~~(need to redo obi though cuz finally remembered how i did it last time and this is not it)~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anime Velam
Jamie (Jamie): Lol yes xD
Jamie (Jamie): In other news tonight i finish by attempting to get the smaller rope of polyester to be as red as that thicc rope instead of *pink*
Jamie (Jamie): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): You gotta use like a dye that's way darker and use like 3x what you need
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Alternatively. Use liquitex acrulic ink. I've seen ppl dye wigs with that stuff
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *intestines*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Liquitex acrylic ink might also work I've seen people dye wigs with that
Anna (loud and likely blonde): It's like a $7 bottle you can water down
Jamie (Jamie): Yea this is second time around using rit i might pour all of whats left in this time and that a bir over half the bottle or more
Anna (loud and likely blonde): My pyrrha wig was the struggle youre in rn
Jamie (Jamie): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Synthetics are a PAIN to dye, to be honest
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeah use crimson
Anna (loud and likely blonde): That one for some reason lends more to pink than red I used the exact same dye
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Took the whole bottle and a long time and only came out pink. Wig came out red but I swear you can tell it was white originally
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Also how hot is the dye bath
Jamie (Jamie): I mean it just tried to boil over so.....
Jamie (Jamie): Oops
Jamie (Jamie): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeaa I was worried about that. Try the lower end of the temp range they give u on the bottle
Jamie (Jamie): So hotter than not better? Like i did prolly lower last time so im just going fuck it a little here
Jamie (Jamie): Honestly i. Think it boiled over cuz too much soap
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Idk I had better luck with it just within the range for temp and for longer.
Jamie (Jamie): Ima see what happens here cuz its got almost the whole bottle in there now and uh yea worst case I buy new rope and start over lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Bought a new corset and shirt for Summer
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): 🤔
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~why is his profile private~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That kind of thing is best done with friends. Not people asking popular cosplayers to join them.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and followers are not friends~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): followers are food
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~friends can be followers but followers are not automatically friends~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): friendship and following on instagram are not the same thing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I know of at least one cosplayer I quite like, have shot with before, and enjoy seeing at cons. But I don't follow them cause they post *excessively* and I find that clogs my feed.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah like you can make friends over instagram but liking posts is not the same as befriending them
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): assuredly. ~~Though if you've never met in person and haven't done more than pleasantries I don't think internet friendships are possible~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I'm a shy introvert, the Hashtag Worst ™ combo.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): if i have an online friendship its through discord tbh
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): mm. Instagram followers just can't be trusted man.

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yikes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hard pass
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What did you end up telling him?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I told him I'm not comfortable anyone else wearing it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:valid:420824413592748032>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Look if any of you ask to borrow my costume stuff: Sure! Good ahead~! I trust ya'll
But a stranger ask: Oof no... I don't trust what they'd do to it and unsure of so many things 😬
Marisa (Mawisa): people can break costumes even without wearing them. imagine the danger with someone else wearing them.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeeee
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I doubt it'd even fit him
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it's a long boi
Marisa (Mawisa): a girl i know worked for months and spent a ton of money on a costume for otakon and it got broken on the way to the con when someone walked into her. she was so devastated 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes 😱
Jess (whoozica): OO NO 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa I am always cool with friends borrowing my stuff if it fits them and props too. Cause I know they'll handle it with care and return it to me. Someone I don't know.. ya can't be too sure of that though
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Tb my friends take care of my props when borrowed more than I do XD~~
Marisa (Mawisa): refused to even come to the con the rest of the weekend. we had to drag her out and try to cheer her up with distractions. i don't know what the costume was because it was a big secret cosplay she wanted to reveal and i didn't want to ask and upset her afterwards but i know it had moving wings.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww 😦 That sucks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think the only time someone broke something of mine was Otakon 2014? Somehow Mark (not the one in here lol) dropped my scissor blade and the handle cracked over my shoe when it hit it XD He felt so bad. I thought it was funny and now I have a forever memory on it cause you can see where it happened LOL
Marisa (Mawisa): OH NO
Marisa (Mawisa): <:rip:378273525804433408> ✂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Everytime I make a new Scissor blade for someone my dad says I should jsut sell them my old one and I'm like nooo but the scar it hasss XDD
Marisa (Mawisa): battle scars
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea!!
Mark (Mad Doctor): The first time Audrey cosplayed Ruby at Zenkai, someone stepped on her scythe. I asked "does someone have glue?" and like a dozen people pulled tubes and glue guns out of their bags. Gotta love the community sometimes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cosplayers got each others backs in crisis 👌
Anna (loud and likely blonde): first time at toracon a homestuck walked downstairs to where a bunch of cosplayers were sititng and she just shouts. "COSPLAYERS. DOES ANYONE HAVE HOT GLUE?" and legit four people whipped out hot glue guns. 
a karkat dual wielded got2B glued hairspray
Marisa (Mawisa): homestuck to the rescue!
a kanaya cosplayer helped superglue clay to my face i will never forget her kindness
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Also, I totally jacked some of them armor PDFs as well Anna if that's okay!~~
