Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh shit, yes thank you that should probably work

Erik (slendergiant): I had friends do a presentation on this shit in class one time. They coated a piece of loose leaf with it and dunked it in a bucket of water and it was completely dry
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -adds this to every cosplay i've ever made- ðŸ‘€
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "now you're impermeable"
Mark (Mad Doctor): On a scale of one to " fekkin' stupid", what do y'all think of this idea for securing leg armor to thighs and calves:
1. Create a belt with a securely fastened rare earth magnet within. I was going to use webbing straps and duct tape. Mark contact points where body routinely touches armor. 
2. Epoxy large fender steel washers to inside of armor at contact points.
3. Voila!
Seems like it would work. Am I missing something?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): it sounds like your making a magnet garter belt. But a few of those terms went over my head.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yep, magnet garter belts it is. Should I worry about such powerful magnets so close to my body?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!245270932602486784> since you have the one on Pyrrha's back.
Erik (slendergiant): As long as you don't have them close to your credit cards or electronics I think you should be fine

Mark (Mad Doctor): Thanks. Seriously, these suckers are powerful. I bought 1" round ones and I think I may have gone for overkill as usual
Erik (slendergiant): when it comes to keeping things attached to your body, overkill doesn't exist
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah you just have to worry about skin getting pinched and hurting your electronics
Georgia (Something Sensible): Otherwise the magnetic fields are okay
Matt (mattmyers25): Can you use magnets to hold a sword?
Matt (mattmyers25): Like qrows
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yup.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The Sage I shot at Otakon had his sword mounted that way.
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I just ordered mama body paint and wig!! One step closer to being krolia :)
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Cant wait for cce
Jess (whoozica): <@169297844874903552>  do you know why the garment Raven wears is called?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay ): Isnt it a knock off gi dress mix
