Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I would love to do bahumbug toga‚ô°
Georgia (Something Sensible): tho in that vote, people were allowed to vote for both
Georgia (Something Sensible): which made it a little wonky
Georgia (Something Sensible): i could throw up another poll, this time people can vote only one way?
Georgia (Something Sensible): alternatively, we could just cosplay whatever
Georgia (Something Sensible): tho im a slut for coordinating with friends SO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): While I'm all for coordinating costumes, I think letting people do whatever they want might be a good idea
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah like im split, i could do Pyrrha or I could do Ochako easily
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~its the same outfit tbh im just gonna do a wig change because fabric is expensive and no one will recognize my outfit from last year~~

i know you can sweat certain types off but thats abt all
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah you can sweat water-based ones off

Georgia (Something Sensible): oil based ones dont really get sweat off tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): they just clog your pores like HELL
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Hope you like blackheads
Jess (whoozica): I think I got water based to try
Georgia (Something Sensible): one could say that water based paints are for winter cons and oil based are for summer
Georgia (Something Sensible): to minimize skin damage
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~water based is traditionally cheaper~~
