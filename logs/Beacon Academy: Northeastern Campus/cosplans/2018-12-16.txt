Matt (mattmyers25): My hiro top is here
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hehe it looks so silly without the rest@of the uniform üòÇ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Chef hiro
Jamie (Jamie): Ah <@433313354744987648> dont remind me I need to make a pillow top uniform for my girl
Marisa (Mawisa): Ahh the classic party in the front, business in the back coat
What part do you need help with?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Those who use EVA foam. What size thickness of foam would ya'll recommend to make this? üòÆ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): (The main blade part that is. Handle and fancy pieces sticking out I already got ideas on how to do, so they won't be EVA lol)
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): personally i don't like using foam for blades
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): if i do i get thin foam and use it as a center for something else
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): <@301927856240459777> I doubt wanna fuck it up. Like how to do It and it be in one piece
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Dont*
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Study cardboard
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Strudy
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): like look at how <@!245270932602486784> did her pyrrha sword 
Foam underneath, then covered with worbla
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm so like still use EVA foam as base or another type of foam?
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): yeah it can work cause they layer well
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That'd also be smart cause I plan to do the crazy stick out pieces in worbla lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Solid! Do you suggest a certain thickness of EVA to start with? ~~I'm new to EVA so am lost when comes to it lol~~
Marisa (Mawisa): <@!433313354744987648> 
If you need a pattern you could probably modify the pattern for a waistcoat with tails, and add a collar and long sleeves.
or you might not even need the tail patterns since in that picture it looks like the tail just goes straight down and doesn't curve at all? does it billow dramatically? (I've only read a few volumes of the manga and that was over 10 years ago sorry.) the real costume in that image looks very baggy whereas the anime it looks more form-fitting so maybe you could put some darts in the back around your waist.
or a plain zip-up jacket pattern would work but shorten the front and extend the back. as long as you iron everything as you make it and after sewing it together, the lining will stick to the outer fabric so don't worry about it laying strangely. You could bond them together but it's an extra step and not really necessary, especially if you want it to be swishy or billowing. 

without a pattern, how to do it depends on how many seams you want. You could do the tail separately from the top (that way only the collar and tail need to be lined and you can save fabric), and that makes it easier to experiment, but there'd be a visible waist seam. If you want the tail to come around the front then you'd need 4 front panels. Or if you want the tail to only be around back then you could get away with only 2 front panels. I personally think the four front panels look more accurate and will fit you better since you can make it more form-fitting, like this person did (it also looks like theirs is designed to billow), but it's also more work.

do you have a mannequin? if you do I'd recommend making a mock-up on that first, but if not and you're still super uncertain then see if you can get a friend to help make a mock-up on yourself with some cheap fabric.
Marisa (Mawisa): are there multiple tails? I can't tell, on a figurine he has one but in some reference images he has two?
Marisa (Mawisa): in another figure he has two tails tytyktyjhgfd but i think that's a different form or something
Marisa (Mawisa): i'm not too certain what's going on with the jacket at all sorry but if you need help with the hakama hmu
Marisa (Mawisa): if you don't have or can't find a base pattern to start drafting from, these might be helpful:

Marisa (Mawisa): wait. the back is pretty similar to Yang's vol 4 jacket right? someone who's made that may be able to assist
Georgia (Something Sensible): <@!169297844874903552> yeah im a fan of the EVA foam base with worbla on the outside
Georgia (Something Sensible): ive chucked my props across the room before and theyve been okay ;3c
Georgia (Something Sensible): i can show you how i did everything after finals are over lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): if you really want pure EVA foam tho, you want 3/8"
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EJPGG4/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats the type i use, just floor mats lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): and for smaller raised details, id use this
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KDMQB4Y/?coliid=I298W9JQ8GP4WO&colid=20G9TMPJUTBJ7&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it
Georgia (Something Sensible): and for really flat details, id use the craft store really thin EVA foam
Georgia (Something Sensible): like i said, i can be of more help when physics finals are over lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thank! üôå I appreciate
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): <@301927856240459777> It's just straight down no tails. No dress form but my love is going to try to fit it on me cause that's what we did with raven branwen shirt cause we made it from a big button up. All your info is so helpful ! I wanna to try to attempt the make because the outfit is 120$ but I found pants wide leg on amazon for 20$ so why not try saving money
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Its like a trench coat but with the square stomach
Matt (mattmyers25): Here is my costest of hiro
