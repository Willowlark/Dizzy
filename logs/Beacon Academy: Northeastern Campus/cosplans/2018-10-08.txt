Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have to change out the clip cause it's too big and an obvs wrong color but Oof it's done... this was a annoying to do lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also gotta touch up some edges showing white
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Eyyyy niceee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thank! 😃
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Ok I need help deciding on something. I’m doing a halloweenesque Pyrrha outfit on Thursday, for the gloves: short, long or one of each?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): one of each.
Erik (slendergiant): long
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Long
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Long
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Either way they’re going to be fingerless because I ain’t got time to take them off every few minutes to use my phone
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Short
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YOU CANT CHANGE YOUR VOTE
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I DIDNT KNOW THEY WERE GONNA BE FINGERLESS
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Sorry should have stipulated that first
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~quietly deletes earlier vote so i never changed my vote~~
Erik (slendergiant): How short is short?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Stop at my wrist bone
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Bones?
Erik (slendergiant): If the fingerless bits are like this, I'd say short: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1403/7603/products/Protext-fingerless-sleeve-black_grande.png?v=1470008612
Erik (slendergiant): If this fingerless bits are like this, I'd say short: https://image.dhgate.com/albu_271386126_00-1.0x0/1-pcs-oprea-sexy-girls-black-fingerless-gloves.jpg
Erik (slendergiant): But like, if they're like this, these'd be cute: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1403/7603/products/Protext-fingerless-sleeve-black_grande.png?v=1470008612
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ^^^ very good point

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *and they say thigh highs is a science*
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Hmmmmm

Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Hmmm 
Long
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): if it's borderline goth, it's gotta be hot topic.
Jess (whoozica): nah hot topic does reliably sell them anymore 😂
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I know they have gloves, tights and thigh highs but when I was there last week they didn’t have a shirt or anything
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Amazon prime
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Hal
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IM BROKE
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): The shirt would cost the same just hijack somebodys prime
Jess (whoozica): id let you borrow mine if we lived closer 😭
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): This outfit is an amalgamation of a discarded Halloween outfit I made last year and my everyday wardrobe
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Ooo what about spirit halloweeen
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): They have a bunch of random fishnet and lace things
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): They mayyyy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Or Spencer's? They might have something like that
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I just don’t want to spend a lot (if any) money
Jess (whoozica): yea specers would prob have them, but ya money
Jess (whoozica): mines from a thrist shop but thats not too helpful
Jess (whoozica): i think the gloves will look cute no mater which way you do it
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): What if I bought fish net tights, cut the feet off and cut a hole in the crotch and wear it as a shirt 😂
Jess (whoozica): I WAS GONNA SAY THAT
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I KNINDA WANNA KNOW IF THIS WOULD WORK 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jul/21/tokyo-womens-thighs-advertising-video ~~and if you need money...~~

Erik (slendergiant): Check your local dollar stores? They might have some Halloweeny stuff
Jess (whoozica): 🤔  does fabric paint work on spandex?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes but it will probably crack when stretched
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^^
Georgia (Something Sensible): yes, not super well, but with a small enough surface area and enough coats, you can do it
Georgia (Something Sensible): preferably wear the garment and have someone paint the design on while you wear it
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats what i did for my ladybug suit
Georgia (Something Sensible): its awkward but it WORKS
Erik (slendergiant): That's what I did with my Blake jammers (lycra, not spandex, but similar concept)
Jess (whoozica): you think i could pull is off for mina? or should i attempt to sew patches of purple spandex on?
Georgia (Something Sensible): sewing patches of spandex is annoying cause its all flippy floppy fabric
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd say paint would work better. I feel if you'd sew them on they areas stitched would pull or so
Georgia (Something Sensible): id say wear the suit and let tom paint on the bits
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed with Georgia lol
Jess (whoozica): 👌
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): gonna need a lot of patience
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lmao
Jess (whoozica): sweet id perfer to do that anyway
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah you cant touch stuff while the suit dries lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <:mew_face:498919883766235137>
Jess (whoozica): das ok, he paint my entire arm for me whenever i cosplay lilith
Jess (whoozica): why are shoes so spence I swear the most expensive part of any cosplay is the shoes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right?? Like half the time the shoes are just as expensive if not more expensive then the outfit
Jess (whoozica): tagently if anyone has mid calf to full calf purple rain boots in size 6.5-7.5 and they dont want them, hmu
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Try checking thrift stores or a place like Ollies, TJ Maxx.... they might have them! That's wear I found boots I've needed like that before~
Jess (whoozica): 🙌
Jess (whoozica): yea i was thinking of that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ikd if ya'll have Ollie's in your area but they always have rainboots around this time of year (at least here they do) 😃
Jess (whoozica): Ive never heard of them 😮
Jess (whoozica): ooo nearest one is about an hour
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Huh I wonder if they are just based around my area? O.o Weird lol
Jess (whoozica): its in middletown, NY which used to be my main shopping area (i.e. mall) when i lived at my parents
Jess (whoozica): OH but we do have an ocean state job lot in toen i should check there

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if you get rain boots in any color you can use angelus leather paint to paint them purple
Jess (whoozica): you'e an angel

Jess (whoozica): ~~you guys know or anything that paints suede?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): real suede? or like suede feeling?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cause angelus works for suede leather

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): rip, not sure if it'd work
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i can test it when i get home
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i have fake suede laying around i think
Jess (whoozica): well this is for a different project so the paint is still useful for mina!
Jess (whoozica): I think georgia may have used it on her weiss shoes now that im thinking about it 🤔  I ask her alter!
Georgia (Something Sensible): i had patent leather shoes for weiss
Georgia (Something Sensible): and i used leather paint that micheals had
