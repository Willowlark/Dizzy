Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Truth. I never shop at craft stores without a coupon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I line when the cashiers are like "Oh here let ne scan this coupon and you'll get 20% off!" And I'm like fucking sweet dude thanks
Matt (mattmyers25): I hate when I get something I can use a coupon on and it's on sale
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): <@386874959009415170> On days when I cashier I try to be like that. Expect to Karens who are entitled and demand all the discounts. Then you get nothing, good day.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fucking Karens
Jess (whoozica): ~~das my mom's name~~ 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Except Mrs. Whoozica
Jess (whoozica): I send her all the memes with her name on them
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I just tried to picks the generic middle age lady name. I get plenty of entitled Susans and Barbaras, ect
Jess (whoozica): LOL it's fine she cursed me with typical name also
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I have the curse of an old school name so every old person I meet is like "Did your parents name you after the girl from Mickey Mouse Club???"
Jess (whoozica): The struggle is real
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have the curse of spelling my name with a K
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Oof. I feel that. I'm always missing letters. I'll get Anette or Annet or Anette
Matt (mattmyers25): My gfs name is michell
Matt (mattmyers25): Not Michelle
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I think the worst is as a kid the insurance company somehow screwed up so bad they put Amet on my card <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Mawisa): lies her name is michi that's totally her real name
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I have the curse of an Arab name
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm just lucky I got my grandmas name as my first name instead of my grandfather's
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I feel that, my family is Polish, so I could have gotten worse. Most people just stare into the void upon seeing my dad's first name.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: My grandfathers name starts with an R sound that isn't a part of the english language lol
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Haha. My dad's name starts with a W. It doesn't make a W sound.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: eyy
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: living our best lives
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I saw talk of being nice and giving coupons without being asked. I do that on occasion. Depends on how the people act towards me. Like if they ride nah. But if they are nice, etc and aren't already got one planned I sometimes do.
Jamie (Jamie): Best coupon story i have is my friend worked at Joannes and she helped me when checking out to turn a total of 90 down to only 45 bucks 😍
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof. I wish I could be that nice but I'd get in serious trouble if I gave more than allowed customers discounts 😭
Jamie (Jamie): So i forgot i followed an account whos designs rival that of Hannah alexander
Jamie (Jamie): 
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): <@169297844874903552> I give nice customers whatever coupons/discounts are available for the day if they don't already have it, so I don't get in trouble. Like I've had a few customers talk BnHA or RWBY with me and I'm like okay you're getting discounts.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): My direct management is also pretty flexible about coupons. It's more corporate that's not.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lol wow we don't have cool customers like that xD~~ I usually if they ask give them what I can without getting in trouble.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Also <@386624706612297729> I love sunsetdragon
Jamie (Jamie): 
Jamie (Jamie): A freaking beautiful flounder design even 😍
Jamie (Jamie): Hey i see a familiar name in those likes haha 👀
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I literally has a customer one day come in and ask me how to make Garbo for some occasion, I think it was his mom's birthday? He didn't say Garbo, but I figured it out through context clues (mainly the RT shirt and asking about gluing things to trash bags).
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Also <@386624706612297729> I love her Pokemon designs. But of the Disney ones I think this is my favorite
Jamie (Jamie): Its all sp pretty and cute 😭😍😭😍

Georgia (Something Sensible): does this color work? cause their other yellow is like yang yellow and their orange is like the color of my yang socks
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Hnnnnnnyes. It's easier to get face paint that color too ngl
Georgia (Something Sensible): ye its a little more yellow than i want but all starfire cosplayers go for different shades it seems
Georgia (Something Sensible): some just dust orange on their actual skin tone, some go for straight yellow, some go for dark orange
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think all are supported by the comics at some point or another
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): alright this comparison looks pretty spot on
Jess (whoozica): Just rub some bad fake tan on
Georgia (Something Sensible): and then panic when it doesnt come off for yang LOL
Jess (whoozica): It's fine
