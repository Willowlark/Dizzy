Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey anyone know good material for a cape that will have a lining in it? I want to do cotton knit but it’s like $20 per yard and I’d rather not break the bank >_<
Mak (hollyjollymak): I know Casa Collection satin is really good quality, and if you can get it on sale (which Joanns does *all the time*) it shouldn't be too expensive
Mak (hollyjollymak): That's what I've used to make my capes in the past
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ooooh okay! I’ll look into that! ^_^
