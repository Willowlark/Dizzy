Georgia (Something Sensible): its actually kinda hard to find the ugliest, shiniest version of Pyrrhas pajamas what the fuck
Georgia (Something Sensible): if anyone is an amazon searching mastermind and finds them hmu but in the meantime im only finding mens pajamas and theyre not even that close
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I found something but they're probably hella out of your price range

Georgia (Something Sensible): well the ugliness mostly comes from the color
Georgia (Something Sensible): if they were like, red and cute i would be inclined to say they were nice

Georgia (Something Sensible): like _dehydrated pee pee_

Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ooh good finds. Those $19 ones could work

Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Marisa (Mawisa): could use a nice bath in some gold leather paint
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): that looks more brown what the fuck
Marisa (Mawisa): she was being a hazard and blinding too many folks. it started messing with airplane sensors so they asked her to tone it down.
Georgia (Something Sensible): i could do with a sleek brown
Marisa (Mawisa): that sounds like the name of the paint color someone buys when they bought a messed up house with the intention of flipping it and they just ripped out the carpet and paid a fortune to get hardwood floors put into the master bedroom and they think some nice contrastive colors on the bottom wall paneling will really make the whole room pop but first they gotta tear down the wall of the closet to make the room bigger and more appealing to house hunters
Mark (Mad Doctor): That last post made me think someone new jouned the server
Marisa (Mawisa): Itâ€™s a welcome post for the spirit of Christmas cheer
Erik (Red Riot Thot):
