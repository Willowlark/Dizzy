Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): Si
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I jsut realized... these are fairly heavy. RIP my head and wig. Idk how imma attach them. I was gonna do clips but my mom thinks a headband. Idk what would be best
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: headband and put them back a little further on yourh ead than you would normally
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: otherwise if you dont care you can literally hot glue them into the wig
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: like part the hair and just. splort
Rebecca (madameterralupus): D: lol look I love hot glue.. but omg WHAT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XDD
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: mist did that to her Rayla horns lmfao
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh üòÆ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Interesting lol
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Wait no
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: OR you can put like. cam screws into the horns and put them through the wig n have something flat on the underside of the wig
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Ye
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Screw them
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: like the kinpatsu ponytail method except removable
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm I shall look into that. Probs the best idea cause they fairly  hefty
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Or you can use a headband underneath the wig and cut two slits in the wefts
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): It will hold the wig and the horns in place
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): I did it for ava from avas demon
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Like a stretchy headband
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): And feel the horns through the wig
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Feed
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: ohhhh if you put them in the right place u might not even have to cut holes 
seconding all this cause my grimm yang wig i used clips and it was hell
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: do not use clips
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: *do not*
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I shall see about doing one of those. Sounds smarter. I was gonna do clips but uhh.... feel theyd break off lol
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: you will also manage to smack it and throw one across the room by accident
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG
Rebecca (madameterralupus): horns said : *yeet*
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
