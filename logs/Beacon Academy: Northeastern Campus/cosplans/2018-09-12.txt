Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Oh lordy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): RIP to my second long black wig... it is now a tangled frizzy mess too ðŸ˜« had to go order a cheap amazon one for the sunflower shoot this weekend that can get here in time lol
Jess (whoozica): Oh no! Just too tangled?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa ðŸ˜« I tied the back up and it's like all knotted around the hair tie from being in the water lol
Jess (whoozica): ðŸ˜­ Tom and I use a combination of the wet brush, and mane and tail detangler to detangle our wig but idk if would be enough
Jess (whoozica): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I might try that out eventually. I managed to get it untangled before when it was bad but don't think it was this bad XD
Thanks for the suggestion!!
Jess (whoozica): Yea no prob! Long wigs are a pain ðŸ˜­
