Erik (slendergiant): The struggle of buying cosplays online is deciding which size to get...
Jess (whoozica): YEET
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If you're getting from a site based in Asia always go a size bigger than you normally wear I say. Cause often times they run small.
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): -ALWAYS- go bigger.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I always go bigger. Even if the measurements add up.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ deff
Erik (slendergiant): it's especially hard for me because of my height...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I usually fluctuate from small to medium, but the issue is that all manufacturers are different
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh yea I get that height thing lol
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): I try to make sure if it's a US sizing chart first. But many factories fit their samples to their own workers. So it's just safer to go larger/taller.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like when I actually have expendable money I wanna buy a Yuno Gasai and Monika cosplay but I’ll have to keep sizing in mind cause I’m getting r from Amazon.
Erik (slendergiant): based on the sizing, if I go by me height, I'd need a 3XL, but by my waist/chest I'm a medium... RIP
Jess (whoozica): 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): RIP... that sucks :/
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I would say take it in but it depends on the costume >.<
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): ^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also like...certain things are a butt to take in
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Do they have options for custom measurements?? You could always do that.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like PLEATED SKIRTS
Erik (slendergiant): https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B7KQTWF/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2VQBHKCW3PEOX&psc=1
Erik (slendergiant): It's this sexy uniform 😏
Jess (whoozica): Since it's shorts I would worry about height too much
Erik (slendergiant): I'm more concerned about the sleeves
Erik (slendergiant): I might just go XL and see how it is and if I need to go bigger or smaller I can try to exchange it
snow ( crescentbladed ): I’d go xlarge
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): I'd clarify their return policy before buying, but you're probably safe since it's Amazon.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm this is true. You can always see about doing that. I'm sure the size you need will be fine. Often times too the sleeves are pretty long on costumes
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): When do you need it by?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Wait, ok so i was looking up the female version this morning, ebay has sellers that are about the same price and ship dates that take "custom sizing"
Erik (slendergiant): Otakon
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you MIGHT wanna go that route
Erik (slendergiant): I'll look into that as well
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): Otakon is first or second week August?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because youre SUPER tall and skinny, so if you get any asian size the sleeves will be WAY too short no matter which one you pick
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof that’s gonna be fun. If you can I’d get custom if you can
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): Because you're safe. But if it gets to crunch time, lemme know and I'll give you my DHL Express account number.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i ordered a few things in sizes large and xlarge from asian stores in the past and the sleeves were even too short on me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and im ..small
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *damn I wish I ordered costumes and the sleeves were too small for me xD they always too long for me*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I always try to go with custom size even then it can be awkward
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): I remember we were designing jackets for the company I was with a couple of years ago, and their shoulders were set two or three inches lower.
snow ( crescentbladed ): _i need to just make stuff myself bc nothing ever fits Perfectly_
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): Couldn't even t-pose
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like my Neo cosplay. Pants fit but are right AF and the jacket was kinda big
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): NO T POSING?!! BLASPHEMY
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): If we tried, the seams at the shoulders just ripped.
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): It was baaaaaaad
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Making stuff can be a pain too >.<
Like my Winter jacket needs darts even though I made it so it would fit my body
snow ( crescentbladed ): _evil darts_
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also finding fabric that looks nice and is nice to work with is a struggle
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I hate cotton
snow ( crescentbladed ): your jacket still looks awesome tho,,
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I hate it so much
snow ( crescentbladed ): FINDING FABRIC IS HARD
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): A buddy of mine's mom is a seamstress if anyone needs to go that route.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thank you >\\\\<
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): Lel
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I need to dye fabric because my Joann’s sucks and didn’t have stretchy dark brown fabric I could use for Pyrrhas gloves so I have to dye the fabric I chose
snow ( crescentbladed ): I’ve always just ordered fabric online bc my Joann’s is Rlly Shitty
snow ( crescentbladed ): dying works too thO
snow ( crescentbladed ): I have a really big desire to try and make Lapis lazuli’s dress when I get home. wish me luCK
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oooh have fun! I’m sure t will look amazing!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Pyrrha’s corset is gonna kill me. Why did I decide to do faux leather
snow ( crescentbladed ): IDK but I appreciate ur support
snow ( crescentbladed ): I BELIEVE IN U
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ima die OwO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ripperoni Peoperoni
snow ( crescentbladed ): then you’ll just be canon tho
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Press F to pay respects 

F A C K
snow ( crescentbladed ): _aggressively spams F_
snow ( crescentbladed ): It’ll be a bitch to make but it’s gonna look DOPE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THAT WAS MY MENTALITY XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I literally said “I’m gonna hate myself but damn will it look good”
snow ( crescentbladed ): XDD blood sweat and tears but it’s WORTH
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Then I’m gonna try and make Cinder out of red velvet for Katsu R I P ME
snow ( crescentbladed ): That’s also gonna look really good owo I wanna try and do raven for katsu on Saturday!!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Shit I wanna do raven too and have Chris be Tai
Heck
snow ( crescentbladed ): S O MANY COSPLANS!!!! ~~do it~~
snow ( crescentbladed ): I will never not enable u both
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ezcosplay had a jacket that fit me, so they run american sizes. If that helps,
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Please enable me it makes me have more things to do and distract me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): EZCOSPLAY IS A GODSEND
Evie (Katheryne Knight): and they have high quality stuff really
Erik (slendergiant): <@!229713389511901185> not sure how crafty Chris is, but if he does Tai, let me know if he needs help with anything!
Erik (slendergiant): I originally looked at EX cosplay for Goro but wasn't sure how long they take and also the prices were more but I guess because it's good quality?
snow ( crescentbladed ): I’m probably gonna end up ordering ilia from ezcosplay
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!386874959009415170> he’s better at making things. I’m the seamstress in the relationship XD 

I think they have Ilia for a good price <@!266718984571846656>
snow ( crescentbladed ): Yasss I saw they have her outfit. I’ll more than likely end up getting it x’D atlas girls 5ever
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *cough*iplanondoingblakejoinmyharem*cough*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): **cough** *Erik has claim to all booty fueled harems here* **cough**
snow ( crescentbladed ): :333 catmeleon
snow ( crescentbladed ): I will join ur harem gen
Erik (slendergiant): I wish you could buy individual pieces of the costumes because I'd love the Tai shirt and vest they have, but literally that's all I like about their Tai cosplay
snow ( crescentbladed ): My friend bought her tai cosplay from there and I think it’s rlly cute XD
Erik (slendergiant): I just don't like the colors
snow ( crescentbladed ): yeah they’re a lil off
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I don’t think it’s terrible thankfully
snow ( crescentbladed ): it’s not!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It relieves me because that gives me one less costume to worry about since I’d be making Raven. 
Why do I do this XD
snow ( crescentbladed ): Yeee I wanna make raven but I’m also just. _how tho_
Erik (slendergiant): So the EZ cosplay darlifra uniform is about as much as the one on ebay with custom sizing so I'll probably just go with EZ cosplay
Erik (slendergiant): I've honestly been toying at the idea of a GB Raven
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Go with EZ it will probably be better quality anyway
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just bought my Raven cosplay... made it a lot simpler. I'm helping Heather make hers from pre-made stuff so I could help you too if ya want <@!266718984571846656>  😛
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^i know where you got yours from too. I have it saved on my Etsy
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We're going to need to hire an Oscar to sweep up after all these Ravens.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I was thinking ofnjuat buying the obi, but I’m a tryhard XD
snow ( crescentbladed ): Actually about that.. don’t order from her Etsy
snow ( crescentbladed ): She deleted it
snow ( crescentbladed ): my friend bought her raven outfit 3 months ago, never got it or a refund, person deleted, still trying to get a refund thru etsy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Wait the person deleted it?
snow ( crescentbladed ): yeah she deleted her whole etsy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I enjoy mine mostly cause it saved me time.. but it was a hell of a lot of money for what I got, and I am missing some  details to the outfit I felt should've been added but weren't so I gotta do them myself :\
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If I felt more confident in my abilities I’d commission it from you
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *for
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But fuuuuck I can barely work on my own shit
snow ( crescentbladed ): I just hope my friend gets a refund from that girl xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ I hope your friend does too. That really sucks O.o
snow ( crescentbladed ): Yeahhh.. and she deleted right after trying to contact her
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Was she doing shady stuff?
snow ( crescentbladed ): Not until she deleted and refused to issue a refund
snow ( crescentbladed ): so we made a case with Etsy
snow ( crescentbladed ): she has two days to comply or Etsy will just refund it for us
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Dang.. that's really rude, and dumb of that girl. At least she'll get her money back from etsy. Hopefully she doesn't reply just cause of that so she can finally get money back...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof...
snow ( crescentbladed ): my friends really upset about it xD but I’m just glad she’ll get her money back.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ugh that’s so shitty
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I know when I ordered it the girl was pretty bad a t replying. I was worried I wouldn't get it in time. Her excuse was I am working on several things and pregnant... like okay I get that buuuttt don't take on so much then?? O.o
snow ( crescentbladed ): even if Etsy has to refund it and that girl will be in debt with etsy
snow ( crescentbladed ): yeah like she coulda messaged us and just explained :/ but she just deleted and never talked to us when we asked after 3 months
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa that's really crappy... like wow
snow ( crescentbladed ): definitely not the way to go about things. I think she thought she would get away with just keeping the money.
snow ( crescentbladed ): I’m grateful that Etsy has been rlly helpful bc it’s a lOT oF money to lose
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm yea. Deff not getting away with it lol. I am glad the people running these sites are helpful when it comes to people getting scammed
snow ( crescentbladed ): YEAH omg I was so scared we got fucked over and stolen from
