Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Like way to assume. Not even a "Hey would you like to be part of this?"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea how about asking politely if you are interested
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yikes. 
~~is that like a backhanded compliment? Like they like your cosplay enough but instead of being nice and asking they just assume?~~
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I mean maybe they just really like that cosplay. But I basically took it as, "Yeah She-ra, whatever. Make sure you bring this cosplay I want to see you in."
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Like there are way nicer ways to ask someone if they want to join a group with sounding like you're demeaning it.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yikes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like no?? You cosplay whatever you want
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Right? Like my CCE from what I've got planned already is gonna be packed, I ain't taking demands üòÇ
