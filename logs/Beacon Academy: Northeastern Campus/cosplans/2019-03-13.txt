Jess (whoozica): Oooo thank you! I ended going with a tear drop shape bit I will look at these too
Marisa (Mawisa): For the same price as that gem you can buy the gem mold and make infinite gems :3c
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Cosplaycassie did some gems for Raven and Salem but it looks like she took her shop down and only sells prints now 😕 but that first link is probably where I'll get mine once I get tired of the ones I had bought from cosplaycassie lol
Marisa (Mawisa): I have the exact molds to do it and all the materials except pigment. I only have blue pigment but if I can get other colors I could make them.
Marisa (Mawisa): Actually could do it with acrylic paint, that’s what it looks like they use in that top link. Would come out much nicer with proper pigment though.
Marisa (Mawisa): now that we have plastic cups I’m gonna make some gems today actually does anyone have any requests
Anna (loud and likely blonde): If u have acrylic inks u can probs do it n they would be translucent too
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I can has Navy blue or deep red?

Marisa (Mawisa): What shape u want
Marisa (Mawisa): Here’s pictures of the stuff I did for Katsu with some of the shapes I have
Marisa (Mawisa): They’re small, like fingernail sized
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Whatever u feel like
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Just not hearts or stars basucally
Marisa (Mawisa): Dang it I was gonna do exclusively hearts and stars for you <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Nah typhlosion ain't that cute
