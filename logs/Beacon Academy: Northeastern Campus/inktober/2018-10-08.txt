Jess (whoozica): Jess? Drawing Mystic Messenger fan art again? Just about as likley as you'd guess. Prompt: Exhausted
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I worked on cosplayâ€¦ I havenâ€™t drawn in 3 days and I feel so guilty!! I have an hour and a half break in between classes tomorrow tho so Iâ€™ll try to catch up then
Erik (slendergiant): You got this! And even though you're behind, you're still doing more than your initial goal!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Gahhh! Thanks Erik, time just got away from me this weekend
Erik (slendergiant): That's understandable
Erik (slendergiant): I need to continue just doing these pencil/paper/outline drawings because they're hella faster and I had no time to do anything cosplay related until tonight
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Youâ€™ve colored ALOT of them on the compooper, take a break and give yourself time to do other things!
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): The reason I didnâ€™t have time to draw this weekend was cause I was finally working on cosplay stuff. I got a lot done but I still have a lot to do over the next two weeks
Jess (whoozica): That's ok! Also if you want you could commit to just a few days a week instead of everyday! I think the point is just to improve and form a habit I wasnt going to do today's but I've had the idea since the first day so I really didn't wanna skip ðŸ˜‚
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I missed the past few days but I donâ€™t want to loose my momentum and just fizzle out? If I donâ€™t post anything tomorrow everyone yell at me
Jess (whoozica): Nooooo I couldnt do dat!
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I still need to todays
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): GIRL YELL AT ME

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Much appreciated
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): needs more bold.
Erik (slendergiant): Tomorrow's prompt on the official list is "star" so depending what direction you take that in, it could be very easy ðŸ˜‚
Jess (whoozica): TRUE
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Hmmmmmmm ðŸ¤”

Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Done
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): **kiri would defiantly let Baku out the star on the top of the tree**
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I misplaced my nice pen and now i cant finish my inktober for today :c
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): What makes a pen nice? Does it say please and thank you
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): it offers messages of support while drawing
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Aww how kind
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): so that you don't get discouraged by self doubt until after its done
Erik (slendergiant): Pen is nice
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Fun fact: I apparently own a nice 48 set of water color brush pens
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Second fun fact: i have no idea how to use watercolor anything
Erik (slendergiant): Is that for the potions prompt?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ye
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): final fun fact 
if you're striving to use only 1 piece of paper for as much of inktober as possible 
watercolor pens are not a good idea
Erik (slendergiant): You mean, you *didn't* draw the potion's seller whose potions are too strong?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): cause they bleed through
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I can't draw people well lol
Jess (whoozica): Day 8 Prompt: Star ~~fire~~
Jess (whoozica): Coloring is kind uneven but turned out better than I expected so whoo
