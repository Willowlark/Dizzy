Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The best art happens on post its ....and then you regret using a post it.....
Jess (whoozica): YES 😭
Jess (whoozica): then you try to re draw it bigger on paper and NOPE it looks like butt
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEP
Erik (slendergiant): Part of me just wants to do everything by hand and leave it as just the outline, but another part of me wants to take the time and effort to sketch it by hand, scan it to my computer, and do the outlining digitally ~~and then torture myself coloring it too~~ because boy do I need practice with digital inking
Jess (whoozica): yea i feel you i might scan and try to color too
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): <@!386874959009415170>  why not do half and half? Give yourself a break that way, alternate days between regular sketch’s and full colors compooper ones?
Erik (slendergiant): That's not a bad idea
Erik (slendergiant): I can do full color ones for the ones I'm *really* happy with
Erik (slendergiant): By "compooper" do you mean "computer"?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): No I wrote compooper on purpose
Jess (whoozica): so apparently the inktober listing that "lunar" is from is from a company promoting their game "when the night comes" which is a supernatural dating sim? but its not out yet. Like wow ok ~~also sign me tf up~~
