Marisa (Weeb): Hey guys remember Inktober? Haha me neither.
Erik (slendergiant): I tried to keep up with it. But it just took too much time and I have other shit I need to do 😕
Jess (whoozica): inktober? doint know her
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im impressed i even did one full week
Marisa (Weeb): i've been doing it but it's all in my school notes
Jess (whoozica): i did 10 days! then i channeled the energy into cosplay instead whoops
Marisa (Weeb): and they just random scribbles
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): marisa you are stronger than all of us
Erik (slendergiant): I did 10...
Erik (slendergiant): Granted I did those 2 comics as well, but I didn't count them towards Inktober, nor did I post them to my art account because I want to redo them digitally
Marisa (Weeb): ~~comics count as one drawing for each panel 8) ~~
Marisa (Weeb): I was not fully listening to that lecture on curriculum development.
Marisa (Weeb): I just have a note written here that says "they died at a young age. The tomogotchi, not my daughters."
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I wish I learned to draw as a kid.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I tried, I just failed.
Marisa (Weeb): u can still learn ⭐
someone sent me a picture of a picture i drew them 1 year ago and it SUCKS
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I debated on catching up everyday I just didn't have the energy to do so. Or time 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I spent most of high school trying to learn to draw.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It never clicked.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just don't have the talent for it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): drawing is hard
Erik (slendergiant): I used to draw *all the time* as a kid and I wanted to be an artist when I grew up, and my mom, the art major, was like, "No you don't..."
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I have half a dozen sketchbooks and an abandoned Deviantart as testament to the fact~~
Erik (slendergiant): What you lack in drawing skills you make up for in photography skills, which is still art
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cept I don't think I'm that great.
Jess (whoozica): i dabble in many forms of art and master none <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FUck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the majestic water droplets
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well that's like, the first hit my non cosplay stuff has gotten in a month.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thanks.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I did like that one in particular, cause of the water droplets.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): not that I've done any photography in the last month and a half.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Granted, it's been a stressful month or so.
Marisa (Weeb): wow that's a great wolf cosplay
