Marisa (Weeb): [throws all prompts out the window] today i did this at a classmate’s request
Erik (slendergiant): Anyone remember this?
Jess (whoozica): this looks familiar but ic an put my finger on it XD 🤔
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Courage?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I hated that show as a kid though, idk.
Jess (whoozica): that show used to scare me 😭  <@!351785752197201920>  watched it tho!
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Courage was the bestttt
terrifying but amazing
Erik (slendergiant): I think everyone was equally traumatized by *"Return the slaaaaaaab"*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Courage was such a good show but did creep me out a bit when I was little. It was weird XD
Tom (tomukuncosplay): YE BOOI
Jess (whoozica): Ok so I was pretty stumped with the prompt "chicken" 😂 so eventually I thought about the pool game chicken where people get on each other's shoulders and like wrestle? So I was trying to find references to follow for posing to draw four characters doing that but instead I stumbled across a game they play in South Korea where you hop on one leg and try to knock over you opponent with your knee and since Mystic Messenger is a Korean game It fit perfect!  I totally cheated and used colored pencils but I didn't wanna sit till I got home to color it in with markers 😅
Jess (whoozica): Also plz ignore my mitten hands 😖
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Better than mine mitten hands!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~new game, everyone link the Deviantart account you had in HS/Middle school~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww that's cute!!
And lmfao hard pass on that game...
Jess (whoozica): I roughed the hands in with pencil, completely forgot about them and then accidently inked over the mitten and figured I'd just let it go and not make them worse 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): who needs hands anyway?
Jess (whoozica): Srsly, oh I forgot to mention that the game is called chicken fight so I'm still on the prompt!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "Family" 
Went with a found family trope xD
Erik (slendergiant): I love it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cute~!
