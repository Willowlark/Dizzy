Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.facebook.com/events/585433065201852/ Hello @everyone  I know AnimeNext isn't a BNE popular con but do me a favorite and pad the invite list with some interested peeps.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.facebook.com/events/1284091351747654/ I'm helping my buddy start running FE shoots too, so if you like FE (or want to pad the interested list) 👌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I wanna try to go again this year but we shall see. It's close to my vacations lol~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hopefully this year it don't rain if I do go 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea if i go this year it has to not rain again because that fucking sucked
Georgia (Something Sensible): Luckily that con center doesn’t get crowding problems at least
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ( speaking of anext:  i have at least one* space in my room if anyone might need lodging-- im staying at the sheraton thurs-sun, altho im not in charge of the room, a friend is )
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Fire Emblem? 😮 Maybe this is the con I finally cosplay Camilla in some form
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm already doing Ota and CCE. I can't do ANext XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): So frustrated waiting on this internship applications thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): I could end up at all cons or none over the summer
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i might be able to do one day at Anext....
Georgia (Something Sensible): And the nasa stipend is 5000 but if I work for the university I get 11 an hour SO
Georgia (Something Sensible): Comeeee animenextttt
Georgia (Something Sensible): That con was like 30 mins from me before they had to upgrade the venue
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was halfway between me and you georgia
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LmaO
Georgia (Something Sensible): GOSH the red dock could’ve been our meeting spot
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean I appreciate the switch cause it was getting crowded
Georgia (Something Sensible): But the convenience was nice
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i'm still salt about AC, but ye it needed a bigger venue~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): if it rains lets all just go to somewhere n take pics
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~that means i gotta buy a badge~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <.<
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i go to anext to go to the boardwalk
Marisa (Mawisa): aww yeah i miss the red dock
but it's much nicer having it be ~~closer to me~~ in AC and not spread across 4 buildings, and not having to walk over a highway between panels
Anna (loud and likely blonde): pls dont turn into a hood ornament for panels
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yikes i remember that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ve been going to aNext since high school. Even if it’s not perfect it just feels like home.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): AC really blew it for me ngl
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i do not like it there at all
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i go because tradition
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like i force myself to go now
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im feeling a lil like that for toracon and NYCC. NYCC very much so mood
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s how I felt last year but I had a such a good weekend shooting?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): really? in the rain?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): tiny umbrella
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s a very Squad focused con for us too like Zenkai.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i was so upset last year
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Only rained Saturday night and actually that did make the Star guardians shoot meh, but I could handle that now.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it rained more than just the night, we got soaked trying to walk to the boardwalk
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and soaked on the way back
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It started at like 4?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My evening for shooting ends at 7 cause sundown so it’s kinda night lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh thats true
ZombieHunter: <@!184437198865563648>  I'm gonna ask if they want people to notify them of shoots as well - the better you contact the staff, the more you're likely to have some standing against staff
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Can just wait for the official announcement on their scheduled shoots.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): S'long as you don't need to be inside in a pinch like Zenkai, meeting up outside is out of the way and staff doesn't care.
ZombieHunter: for the most part, yes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wouldn't normally put a photoshoot in a traffic area like Zenkai.
ZombieHunter: if theres any issues, as always, message me
ZombieHunter: i know head of safety there too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thank you, will do.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (Is it Kiwi? I feel like I've seen her at Next too)
ZombieHunter: lol she's on staff there
ZombieHunter: but i think Jaren should be head at Anext
ZombieHunter: i'll double check. last year's head moved to california
ZombieHunter: i know most of safety though at animenext
ZombieHunter: and as always, i'll be in the reg room running the volunteer's office
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah. Generally I find it easier to wait until there's a need to add more stress on someone's plate. Cons and photoshoots go hand in hand, so it's not like it's a special request. The need for management comes when the shoot interferes with the con. I like to keep the two good and separate as a default, so the staff doesn't even have to think about it.
ZombieHunter: letting staff know also means no one has a reason to yell at you guys
ZombieHunter: they don't have to do anything, it's just a good idea to always have a contact.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And what better than the head of volunteers? 😛
ZombieHunter: i hate you
Marisa (Mawisa): do you know if they still have staff applications open? yesterday someone was asking me to be an interpreter for them and then Jim asked me to help but they didn't say about staff sign ups
ZombieHunter: xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Really thanks for the offer Hunter. Will keep in mind.
ZombieHunter: applications ended in January or so
ZombieHunter: but I can double check? Worst case, next year is a good option :3
Marisa (Mawisa): i'll ask jim because they were saying they needed help this year which is why they asked me
ZombieHunter: anext is my home so >.> i'm always super busy there 
and worst case, ask jim for Dylan's e-mail?
ZombieHunter: or hold on
ZombieHunter: https://www.animenext.org/information/contact-ushttps://www.animenext.org/information/contact-us
ZombieHunter: click HR and send something to Dylan - tell him Jim recommended you and also mention you worked under Kiwi
Marisa (Mawisa): i'm not sure if i want to be a full staff member since others want me to enter the cosplay contest with them and there's stuff i wanna do, but they said they were really in need
ZombieHunter: that SHOULD be enough to help?
ZombieHunter: i don't know if cosplay contest does groups
Marisa (Mawisa): it wasn't just jim there was someone else who asked first but i can't remember their name
ZombieHunter: i don't think they do......
ZombieHunter: kitty/>
ZombieHunter: ?
Marisa (Mawisa): we arent entering as a group
ZombieHunter: okay well
Marisa (Mawisa): just entering together for fun, separately
ZombieHunter: don't tell me more about cosplay contest
ZombieHunter: >.>
ZombieHunter: i know the entire hall team
ZombieHunter: like all the judges
Marisa (Mawisa): i do too?
ZombieHunter: the judges?
Marisa (Mawisa): most of them yeah I staffed cosplay at zenkaikon and helped run the contest
ZombieHunter: Seiba, Eric, Val
ZombieHunter: and.....
ZombieHunter: Patty xD
Marisa (Mawisa): ye?
ZombieHunter: seiba wasn't at zenkai
ZombieHunter: neither was eric
Marisa (Mawisa): i know 'em, i've been at cons for 10+ years
Marisa (Mawisa): i've at least met 'em
ZombieHunter: >.> i live with one
ZombieHunter: xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ya'll have to have met a dozen times before BNE was even a thing, jesus.
ZombieHunter: jules says not to share much wit hher
ZombieHunter: not likely <@!184437198865563648>
ZombieHunter: unless she knows jasmine
ZombieHunter: which
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): How many other people have been staffing 10 years.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean you and Marisa.
ZombieHunter: i didn't like meeting people until recently
Marisa (Mawisa): i only staff since 2012 i was attendee before :3c
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *only*
ZombieHunter: I started staffing in 2015 or 16
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Didn't you staff like three weekends in a row leading up to Ota?
ZombieHunter: but i've been a volunteer at anext since 2010
ZombieHunter: or 09
ZombieHunter: i don't remember anymore
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah the years blur together.
ZombieHunter: I'm going with before i was engaged so
ZombieHunter: xD
ZombieHunter: but Nai knew me from anext but kiwi is trying to get me to run volunteers at Zenkai next
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what happens if you move to VA tho :c
ZombieHunter: I'd still come to anext
ZombieHunter: lol
Marisa (Mawisa): zenkai is understaffing and they're cutting our budget for more staff and a lot of people are unhappy
ZombieHunter: lol tbh anext if they keep rolling this way
ZombieHunter: i give it maybe 3 years
ZombieHunter: anext is in a boiling pot of hot water right now
Marisa (Mawisa): i worked more than ever before this year which is why i'm hesitant to take up their offer for animenext, even if i do work with famous guests
ZombieHunter: otakon staff is fun
ZombieHunter: i do DLRP
Marisa (Mawisa): they've tried to get me to do ota but that's too far, i prefer to staff closer cons
ZombieHunter: DRLP**
Marisa (Mawisa): further ones are vacations! ⛱
ZombieHunter: i don't mind as long as housing stays free
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Next is going to have to address the constant distaste for AC when they're contract with the con center goes up.
ZombieHunter: Unfortunately that isn't an issue for them
ZombieHunter: the thing is there IS nowhere else togo
ZombieHunter: there is nothing big enough to hold anext
ZombieHunter: this is the only option
ZombieHunter: or go under
ZombieHunter: which it still likely will do
ZombieHunter: because they are a hot steamy mess in the upper levels
Mark (Mad Doctor): No casinos have space to hold it?
ZombieHunter: Not for all the things we do
ZombieHunter: And not for all the people who are underage
Marisa (Mawisa): can't have it in a casino because cons like to be family friendly and casinos have many 21+ areas
ZombieHunter: ^^^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can't remember the quote for it but look forward to Leanna and Georgia climbing on each other's shoulders in a trench coat to (attempt to) usurp me as the Alpha Leo at CCE probably. 

Cause I'm the Alpha Leo now. It was a thing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *and since I can't eat pretzels anymore...*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@&378262258335088650> muhahaha
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 🔪
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Audrey and Lissy can join you. *I shall not be defeated though*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~just force it onto a college campus instead of a casino~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): 🔪🔪🔪🔪
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 🔫
