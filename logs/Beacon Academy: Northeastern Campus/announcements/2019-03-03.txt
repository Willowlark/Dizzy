Mark (Mad Doctor): Great shots, but check spelling on the caption to Marisa's shoot 🌽
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~there’s nothing wrong with Corn~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The character is called Corn a lot as shorthand. Memes you know. Besides. I can’t imagine anyone ever used the gallery caption to find someone.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Live and learn. Thought it was an insidious autocorrect intrusion, like the way it tries to come out Gen:Lick every time I try to type it
