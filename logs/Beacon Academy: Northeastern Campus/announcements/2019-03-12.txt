Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~in like 3 months but idk what con she lives in florida~~ I can probs ask her to stream it ðŸ‘€
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF YEAH SHE SHOULD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): she wants to do it gameshow style where she puts up a real and a fake message and ppl gotta poll in to which they think is real
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's a great idea.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): winner who guessed everything right gets a pikachu plush with "worlds Okayest DM" or ppl who got the most right get stickers
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but yes we are collecting creepy/weird/gross/unsolicited comments and messages.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof I'm tempted

We blur info if u want
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It's not creepy but like Nani the fuck asked you XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Ill take it

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like it's just something you shouldn't do

There is a difference between constructive criticism and being nitpicky. Also like... Why comment?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also if you wouldn't mind blurring out some of the stuff only.causw I'm afraid he'll end up.seeomh.the panel XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yea no worries
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i wish i had that screencap of the person saying on georgias photo basically to lose weight to do the cosplay perfectly. *shudder*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF YIKES
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wish i still had all those screen caps of those people who came out of the woodwork when I did Neo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like "More like Tyrian cosplaying Neo ðŸ˜¬"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like WHAT KIND OF INSULT????
Anna (loud and likely blonde): WHOM S T
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And gems like 

"Please stop cosplaying"
Mark (Mad Doctor): And I'm sure there is a wealth of racist, sexist, ableist comments that boil down to: "you're not exactly like the character so you shouldn't cosplay them." By that standard, Carolina Ravassa was the only qualified cosplayer at Katsu
