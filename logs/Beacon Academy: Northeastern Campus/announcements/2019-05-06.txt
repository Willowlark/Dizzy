Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): @everyone Laser tag at fireball mountain is May 18th, 25 dollars per person, 2pm to 4pm. We can effectively have up to 29 people in the group. Can I get a headcount of who FROM BNE is going, and if we have anyone who wants to bring a friend we can deal with that after the fact. I need a final headcount by next monday. Once we have the final head count, I'll confirm the monetary total for the whole thing and ask for the split (dunno if there's any other fee involved, tax, how the deposit plays out, etc). Again, to be clear, if you are not committed by Monday I'm not telling the place you are coming.
✋ if you are going
1⃣ if you want to bring a plus one
2⃣ If you want to bring two people,
and so on with the numbers.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I may be bringing a plus one  it I don't think they can get off work~~

Monica (absolutezerocosplay): still don't know if I'll be able to get off
