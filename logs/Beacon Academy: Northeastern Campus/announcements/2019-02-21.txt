Jamie (Jamie): Oof hope they dont do the strings again like it was pretty but not what wanted
Marisa (Mawisa): they did the strings because people requested more formal and 'proper' songs. it was looser in previous years and a lot of people complained the songs weren't befitting of a formal dance (maybe too loose, they did play the chicken dance once). when you send feedback, be specific! provide examples of the songs you wanna hear and they'll take it into consideration.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: It felt like They went from one extreme to the other last year
