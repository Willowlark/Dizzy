Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): @everyone So Me and my Dad like to drink fancy bourbons. This is hard to come by sometimes, so we always keep an eye out. In PA, they do a drawing system for bottles which can only be entered by PA residents. I am not a PA resident, but some of you are *soooo....* If anyone in PA is willing to enter the lottery for me, I'd pay you back if you get picked and greatly appreciate it. 🙏 The entry period is next week. 

the details are here. I can't make an account (obviously) so you may need to navigate how to enter yourself but me love you long time?https://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LotteryProductsTermsAndConditionsView?storeId=10051&catalogId=10051
