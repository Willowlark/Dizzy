Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Speaking of new servers.... <@&472064763145224227> I’ve been debating this forever but I’ve wanted to see about making a photographer discord. For general photography talk, tips, tricks, editing, advice etc; then for photo critique and advice. I’ve drafted the server but have hesitated twice to go live on it... thinking starting it as friends of friends. 

Was also keeping it open to people who want to do critiques and learn about photogs, but I imagine if it takes off at all it’ll be more photog. 

Thoughts?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh that sounds neato 😮
