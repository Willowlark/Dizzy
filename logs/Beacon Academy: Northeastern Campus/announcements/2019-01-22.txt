Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We talked last week about doing a meetup of sorts at Knoebels amusement park... I looked up the contact info for the people we'd have to ask for permission, but are people committed to the idea, be it BNE only like chestnut hill or something more? I'd assume we'd aim for a date in spring, or early summer. (I just hate setting things up and finding out I did it for nothing, so I wanna be sure)
