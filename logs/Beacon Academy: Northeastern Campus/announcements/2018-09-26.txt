Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thats it! I knew it was Green something XD I couldnt find it in my messages though. Thank~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~itâ€™s funny cause I ran into Monica after Zenkai 2017 at her job XD~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Itâ€™s probably more accurate to use New Brunswick for mine during the year lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also it looks like Zenkai is the dead middle of all of us tbh
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Hence why many of us met there.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Zenkai is super close for me thatâ€™s why I love it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's more PA biased though.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Throwback to when Animenext was in somerset and nearby people, unlike when it's in AC.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yes
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There's like, a cosplayer belt.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): and the move to AC *literally* took Animenext off the center of that line, to an empty corner of Jersey.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~you were never at the old location okay~~

Jess (whoozica): The place isn't even a con center anymore they couldn't move it back if they wanted
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~right <@!245270932602486784> <@!386874959009415170> ~~
Jess (whoozica): Technically I have been there
Jess (whoozica): Just not for anext
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I was there for a career thing, it's not the same.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): cannot be compared.
Jess (whoozica): ~~still doesn't matter~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *Strong feelings*
