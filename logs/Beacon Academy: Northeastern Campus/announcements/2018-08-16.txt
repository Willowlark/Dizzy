Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): (she's a crazy boss)
Marisa (Weeb): They have the asexuals run the 18+ cosplay events and yet the behind the scenes staff commentary is still wilder than what the attendees say
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Oof
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I got a new job!:D
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): yay!

Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Haha
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Noice~
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): They are giving me a dollar more than panera
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): And after 60 days I'll get a raise and then if I work good they can randomly give me another and they give me stocks and 401k
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): So just gotta wait for her to call and then I can put in my 2 weeks at Panera cause I wanna have checks coming in until wawa is stable income
