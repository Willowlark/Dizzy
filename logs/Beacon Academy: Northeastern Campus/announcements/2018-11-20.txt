Georgia (Something Sensible): POLL TIME!: @everyone Black Friday is coming up, so a lot of people use that as an opportunity to get gifts for people. Would anyone be interested in doing Secret Santa for the New Years Eve party this year? (for people like Casey who might not be able to attend, you can mail your gift to my house and we'll mail yours to you, that way you can still participate!)
Georgia (Something Sensible): Please react ðŸŽ… if interested
