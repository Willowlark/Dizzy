Jess (whoozica): Happy Pi Day ya nerds
Marisa (Mawisa): and Happy White Day 🍫
Marisa (Mawisa): ~~it's come to my attention that some of you need more anime and don't know what white day is~~
~~it's basically valentines day, but on valentine's day only girls give chocolate, so on white day guys give chocolate to girls~~
~~feel free to give me chocolate if you wish to experience this wonderful cultural holiday~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Dominos has a chocolate dessert doesn't it~~
Marisa (Mawisa): never refrigerate that stuff it gets so nasty
