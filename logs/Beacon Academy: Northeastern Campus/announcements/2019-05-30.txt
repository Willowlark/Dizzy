Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I request this picture. Really tiny on the back cover if NOTHING ELSE
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its going to be the cover
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I don't think u understand that I will dead do an oil painting of the stupidest picture in order to capture our fuckery in the best possible light 
One day im just gonna paint. The worst image ever.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): this one might come close
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): or maybe the one that looks like im aggressively humping eriks head while he sleeps
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oil paint that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh wait <@!289944569410224129>  i realize how unspecific i was, your final bee submission isnt due for a long time, you just need to submit a couple examples of your art to the artist application (doesn't have to be bee related) and then our mods are gonna go through applications and narrow it down to like 60 artists
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Oh yeah no I mean my art style is so different now I don't wanna submit something I could do 2 years ago that I can't pull off now. It was just gonna be some erasermic for prelimn
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: ........ Send me the pic of you humping the head
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok good you were picking up what i was putting down without me saying anything
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): excellent
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i love smart people
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i was SCARED because i had to explain what a "theme" was to another mod
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): üòè

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Ssgdggdhfjj
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Also I'm sorry you. Had to. Explain a THEME? Pls tell me it's just they know multiple languages and English wasn't their first
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!334090409389195266> would you be cool if I submitted on of the Xmas Bees from KonKon if Britt is kay with me submitting the image? üòÉ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea go for it!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And yes Anna I later found out they are Italian so I felt bad for getting annoyed but like I got fucking scared for a second
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Nah like. To be fair they could have mentioned English was not their first language when asking what a theme was cause over internet u don't know people 
Fuck y'all I just looked at what I used to be able to paint digitally and. 
Now my skill has lapsed.
