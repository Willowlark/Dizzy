Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m thinkin Middle School Prom
Jess (whoozica): Your middle school had a prom?
Matt (mattmyers25): We had middle school dances
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Jess (whoozica): I had dances but not proms
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Between Zenkai and next are like, three smol cons. If you're planning on going to any of them, react approriately.
📚 Kogaracon, at a small college in north eastern Jersey, free, has almost nothing asides from a handful of small panels and a cosplay contest. Campus is pretty for photos though. April 13th.
💮 Sakura sunday, in phili. Smol cost (10 bucks I think?). Lots of japanese cultural stuff, cosplayers, maybe the trees will actually be in bloom. April 14th.
🏰 Castle point. Two day, 27-28th of April. Basically a dealers hall and thats it. Hoboken. Not alot of picture options outside parking garages and such. ~~Geekdoom but better (typo accidentally but running with it)~~
💣 Geekdom, three day may 24-26th. Some shitty con center in northern phili. Has no good photos, and a dealers hall. Nothing in the way of panels. All of the nier voice actors tho.
Marisa (Mawisa): cpac was good when I could go to bother Kat but she’s since graduated so no point in going to flush her out ;u;
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cpac is in seacaucus now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): meadowlands expo center
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yeah.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but yea the only cool photo spot is the glass bridge
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but..... thats always packed because *only good photo spot*
Marisa (Mawisa): ヘぇー
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sakura Sunday for sure. Been debating CPAC but unsure. Heard it was meh?? And Geekdom depends on who all goes/if have monies cause vacay soon around
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thy Geekdom is right next to Valley Forge national park. IMO it's one of the prettiest places in the Philadelphia suburbs, and it's free. Depends on good weather, though
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also how all plans to go to Anext..? 🤔 ~~I wanna go but it's right between my 2 vacays lol~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~anext is too expensive for what it is now, so i'm still on the fence about it. havent had fun since it moved to AC~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~if the weather is nice i think it'd be fun to just go to the boardwalk... but.... its been bad the last couple years~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yeee it was pretty pricey last year for  badge. ~~Honestly prob could have ghosted it.~~
Jess (whoozica): I go to anext but ill be leaving saturday night this yr
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Boardwalk and beach pics is main reason I wanna go lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): just afraid of spending the money again only for it to POUR
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeeee
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if i do go im not buying a badge >.>
Jess (whoozica): i allready bought 3 day badge
