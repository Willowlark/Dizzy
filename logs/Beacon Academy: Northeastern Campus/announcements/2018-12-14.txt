Georgia (Something Sensible): question: i have the opportunity to get a website for my cosplay stuffs, do i get the domain "wezrez" or "wezrezcosplay"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Can you get both and then whichever you decide on, the other can redirect to the primary one? Or do you only plan on paying for one domain?
Georgia (Something Sensible): i only really wanted to pay for one lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If only one, I'd go with wezrez.com because it's easier to say/remember
Georgia (Something Sensible): though noahs making the same argument that you are
Georgia (Something Sensible): dman
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like that's a common practice, claim a bunch of similar domains so whatever people go to search, it'll redirect to the main one
Jess (whoozica): Ye that's pretty common
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel like its so imcomplete tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): like if you were "joes plumbing" you wouldnt have a website saying just "joes"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): True, but if you ever produce content other than cosplay, you have wezrez as your brand name
Georgia (Something Sensible): THATS THE SECOND ARGUMENT NOAH  GAVE ME
Georgia (Something Sensible): WHERES THE MIC is he feeding you prompts
Jess (whoozica): Well no but the idea is to "catch" as many people as you can like Facebook owns facbook.com also so that if you spell it wrong you still get where your going
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The name "wezrez" is unique to you, whereas "Joe's" is just super common and unspecific
Georgia (Something Sensible): actually the twitter name "wezrez" is somehow taken
Georgia (Something Sensible): how bout that
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): wezrez.com is better
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): for the aforementioned reasons
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): cosplay is redundant ngl
Jess (whoozica): I'd say either do both, or just wezrez
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Simplicity is key in marketing
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ^
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): the easier you make it the better
Georgia (Something Sensible): i guessssss
Georgia (Something Sensible): ill buy both then
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like just wezrez.com
It's simpler and easier to remember.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This just in.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): BNE.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Beacon Northeast.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ALSO *Breaking and Entering*
Matt (mattmyers25): I would say use wezrezcosplay.com
The reason for that is because people will be able to find you easier. I follow a few cosplayers that have use cosplay in there url for their website if they have one. Plus,you dont hslf to worry about someone taking the url and pretending it is you
