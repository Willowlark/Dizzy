Georgia (Something Sensible): Konkon is far away (two months almost exactly) but we gotta have time to make stuff so weâ€™re not crunching. Do we wanna do RWBY or BNHA or something else for Konkon? React to vote, RWBY is <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> , BNHA is ðŸ¤›, something else is ðŸ¤”. You can vote for multiple, and if you vote something else, plz list it below as an idea
