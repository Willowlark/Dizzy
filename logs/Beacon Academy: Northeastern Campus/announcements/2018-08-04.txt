Erik (slendergiant): GONNA GO THIS YEAR EVEN THOUGH IT'S ON A THURSDAY
you want fucking rwby chibi?: whenmst
Erik (slendergiant): And I have to drive 40 minutes
Erik (slendergiant): 10/25
Matt (mattmyers25): Can we create a poll to drum up interest?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The problem is not interest, itâ€™s where to go.
Matt (mattmyers25): True. We would half to trt and find a spot on the middle
Matt (mattmyers25): In
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Weâ€™re fairly spread out so itâ€™d be tough to do with many of us working/in classes that day. May need local groups.
Matt (mattmyers25): This is true
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's a school night for us, so we'll be going to the AMC in Plymouth Meeting again. Last year <@258332980622131220>  <@337060220054274049> and <@327835140216586242> were there, along with Brendan and Tyler
Erik (slendergiant): I think the closest one to me was like, Valley Forge but I'd probably be down to driving extra to Plymouth Meeting
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): We went to Wayne last year, but should likely coordinate with Georgias neck of the woods.
Matt (mattmyers25): <@245270932602486784>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This can be planned after RTX folks.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Con goers are busy as hell.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): (Really need to ditch Way e, my Jaune hoodie made me the most in cosplay person there. (This predates Tom and Jess cosplaying Renora))
Matt (mattmyers25): Agreed
Georgia (Something Sensible): I'll be in New Brunswick! There's a theater 10 mins from college
Georgia (Something Sensible): And New Brunswick has good food afterwards
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also class ends for me by 4 on Thursdays so I can go to night events lol
