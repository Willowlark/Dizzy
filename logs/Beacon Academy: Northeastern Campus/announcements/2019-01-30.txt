Anna (loud and likely blonde): is there a place i can dump a bunch of foam armor patterns
Anna (loud and likely blonde): theyre pdf's
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cosplans?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Probs best place
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): @everyone 

Potential weekends for Fireball Mountain outdoor laser tag, saturday sunday pairs:
May 4th/May 5th 
May 18th/May 19th.
Lemme know if there's a con a large group of us are going to that I somehow missed in that range.  You can mark down for multiple days if they both meet your preferences.
4âƒ£ May 4th
5âƒ£ May 5th
8âƒ£ May 18th
9âƒ£ May 19th
ZombieHunter: Unfortunately May is also finals month and very iffy
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You want to suggest something? I looked at April, but asides from the first weekend (where it'll still be colder) there's Kogaracon/Sakura Sunday, Easter weekend, and then CPAC.
Georgia (Something Sensible): laughs at CPAC
Georgia (Something Sensible): for the good of the group, i would suggest later may or early june but that makes it less likely that i can attend
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 18th or 19th seems like a good time cause most finals should be done by then
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's my thought.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I say aim for that time and if not everyone can attend we can always do another trip later in the summer?
ZombieHunter: Agreed.
ZombieHunter: Early June is ANEXT and colossalcon. But from what I can tell, there is almost nothing in August this year??
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My birthday but that doesn't matter.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, Ota moved to July.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Shh it does too!~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fireball Mountain for Bill's birthday. Let's go
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They do birthday parties but also I prefer drinking and fire.
Georgia (Something Sensible): july, do you mean PARTY MONTH
Georgia (Something Sensible): reiley and i both turn 21
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm cool with whatever as long as it's not June  7th and 8th
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's animenext so you have nothing to worry about.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cause I might be having my own birthday party then
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
OOOH I should just go to ANext and have a con birthday
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also yes, Georgia will throw a party the week before my birthday and exhaust the lot of you.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~unless im in another state oof~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): then we party last weekend in august probably
Georgia (Something Sensible): or a "congrats on the internship" party idk
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's your choice ain't it.
Georgia (Something Sensible): well yeah EITHER WAY theres gonna be SOMETHIN
Georgia (Something Sensible): either an internship party mid may, an actual party late july, or a make up party late agugust
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Anyway, Georgia throwing parties aside.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): S'long as we can get enough people, 25 bucks isn't that much for 90 minutes of play. The gas'll cost more.
