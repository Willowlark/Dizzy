ZombieHunter: @everyone  who wants a channel just for animal pics to make everyone feel better on bad days?
Marisa (Weeb): how did i hear the notification for this ping if i didn't have discord open and my phone is on silent ðŸ¤” 
pictures of animals will surely help me solve this mystery
ZombieHunter: <@!266718984571846656>  fight me
snow ( karma chameleon ): later
ZombieHunter: Boooo
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Probably better as a vent and support thing.
ZombieHunter: I figure itâ€™ll help for when thereâ€™s no one to talk to
