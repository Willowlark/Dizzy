Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My GP has basically started a webcam doctors office. Its for simple stuff obviously, but you schedule online and donâ€™t have to leave home. Sheâ€™s been live for awhile and I feel like some of you may love that idea. Thatâ€™s the info on it. Thereâ€™s on demand appointments too. 

Caviat: you have to be in Jersey.
