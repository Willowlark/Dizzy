I'm going to tell them 10 people, cause that's 9 if Hunter and Heathers' +1s come through, 10 if <@!387456543421104150>  gets off work, and we were supposed to have 10 as a minimum with the reservation and I don't want to tell them we have less.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): if <@!433313354744987648> and <@227431823062466569> could confirm the +1s are coming for sure I'd appreciate it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™m going to start a Facebook DM so people can add plus ones...
ZombieHunter: My plus one declined, but Iâ€™m gonna look for a new one lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): holy shit I can't believe I actually managed to sign my name with my mouse
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SAMe LMAO i was entirely too impressed with myself too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): same
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I have off!!!
