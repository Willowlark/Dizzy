Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): you've got a real sense of style there <@!169297844874903552> . I know you don't have adobe, but do you use anything for post?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I use picasa 3? I think that's what it's called. I want to get better software to edit but probs won't be able to till after college ðŸ˜…
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): does your college offer anything?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Rowan gave us access to a whole bunch of programs.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Not that I know of ðŸ¤·
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): hmmu hmmu.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I might look into it and see. But I haven't heard that they do :\
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): that aside, if you're only doing limited post that's pretty awesome cause nothing underexposed and such. I always end almost a stop lower than I'd like, and I hate it.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Your camera do raw?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think it does?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I honestly don't know too much on my camera cause I planned to get a better one much sooner than I have been able to so I didn't spend much time learning it's capabilities.... it was mostly bought to be a vlog/youtubing camera (which i don't do either of anymore) LMFAO ðŸ˜… I should probs pull the book out someday and read up on it more since don't think I'll be getting a new camera to take it over anytime soon XDD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://petapixel.com/2018/08/29/nikons-new-d3500-is-its-lightest-and-friendliest-dslr-ever/ Speaking of new cameras... That's the Nikon entry level they just updated.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just seeing the photos now, <@169297844874903552>  Great job!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thank you!! ðŸ¤—
