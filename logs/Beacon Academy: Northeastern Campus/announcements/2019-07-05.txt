Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I'm extremely digging Blake's new hair. She looks much more like her momma now 😭💖💖💖
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Blake wins new outfit wars.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): she has 7, possibly 8 zippers, a few of which are super long. blake is a zipper.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I'm waiting until we see the actual models we see in the show but I'm shocked. Blake and Weiss are my initial favorites so far.
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): all those zippers and not a single pocket. monty is sobbing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Weiss is kinda a mess, but seeing the model itself might help.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I like her new hair a lot is what's getting me. Braids are cute, CUTE.
ZombieHunter: LOL but nothing on summer sorry <@!155492347122155520>
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Yang still has to have a slightly irritating asymmetrical thing going with her socks. As is tradition I guess
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Like I like the boot short + thigh high side more. I'm not sure what's happening on the other one
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i think it's like a this thing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Does Yang have a second ember ceilcia again?
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): It's honestly reminding me of those cargo pants that zip into short. Tai? Is that your influence???
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Yeah it looks like she has 2 again
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): u and i are on the same wavelength
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I'm thanking the heavens Yang still has he lovely locks tho. Blake was the best choice to lop off her hair. Looking more like Kali is a bonus :3
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~ah yes the getting over your ex traditionnof chopping your hair~~

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I love Wiess's new outfit she's taking after Winter
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Bye everyone I'm.gonna try making it

Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Honestly I really am hoping if Winter comes back she and Weiss are in their new badass outfits. Here to put their father in his place like bad bitches 😎
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That wold be a dream but knowing RT she's gonna be sent off to Vacuo or soemthing
Matt (lastbetatestercosplay): <@229713389511901185> speaking of winter, do you want to get the flag signed by her va at otakon?
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): <@229713389511901185> We can only pick a God and pray for the return of our Ice Empresses in a lot new outfit.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Also I just realized something. Blake is not exposing any belly, that's what I call character development.
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): ~~also that means I feel comfortable cosplaying her 😭~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yessss.... I hate showing my stomach in her costumes right now cause oof 😦 I'm glad the belly is concealed finally lol
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Ugh, exactly. Less Bella-belly more Bellabooty, am I right?
