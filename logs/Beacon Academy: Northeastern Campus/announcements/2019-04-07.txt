Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Weird mood, posting a gallery of myself feels more narcissistic than posting 3 galleries in a row of my own work. But.

Also weird mood, doing the 'follow X in instagram here' format for my own instagram on a gallery page. I've done like... 200 galleries maybe and I've never been solo in one. Usually it's 'look at Tom and Jess, also I'm over here somewhere.'
Anna (blonde and sad): This is wholesome
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Why am I at the end just astral planeing? ðŸ˜‚
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Cause it was shot by Erik so I donâ€™t want to put it with the other photos for crediting purposes XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That was another blind shot. Just aimed the camera at him and snapped it without even looking at it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Lol
