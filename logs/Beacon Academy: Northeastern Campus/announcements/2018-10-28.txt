Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): @everyone Heyyyy everyone its time for a tiebreaker!!! Last time we voted, it was a 9 to 9 tie for BNHA versus RWBY for the purpose of a KonKon group. 
Following the theme,
 if you vote BNHA please react ðŸ‘Š . 
If you vote RWBY, please react <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> . 
If you are in favor of just all hanging and not having a particular group them vote ðŸ¤· 
While I understand we all enjoy both shows, please only vote for one, as it ensure the tiebreak hopefully!!!
Mark (Mad Doctor): If the weather holds true to last year, I may have to go fursuit.
And set it on fire for warmth
