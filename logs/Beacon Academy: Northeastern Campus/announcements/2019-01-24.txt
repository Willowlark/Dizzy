Erik (Red Riot Thot): $10 for that keychain
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *cos-play*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~to be fair, thats what i thought it was when i first started cosplaying~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i'd ad the dash~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cos-play is for when you are tired of sin-play or tangent-play
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that is a high level joke im floored
Mark (Mad Doctor): The other route was something Bill Cosby related and that shit ain't funny anymore
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): good call
Anna (Cadmium): is sin-play what happened with the dungeon porn
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OwO I want them pants. And that hoodie

Anna (Cadmium): https://store.roosterteeth.com/collections/rwby/products/rwby-beacon-academy-banner <@!245270932602486784>  new decoration for ur basement
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ours is better
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): it is.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if anyone is curious about the ruby purse size
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *our banner was also a better deal*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): truth.
Jess (whoozica): OH MAN DAS A GOOD SIZE
Jess (whoozica): OOF
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 60" x 36" banner for $37.50 vs 60" x 19" for $24.95
Jess (whoozica): ughhh its just the type of low key fandom i like to display <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And based on what little I know about purses (which is basically nothing) $60 seems reasonable?
Jess (whoozica): yea its not.  im a cheapo so i dont like pending mroe then 30 but my last 2 purses ive had were for free soooooo?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I like this minimalist geek thing going on
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Jess (whoozica): i like dat llok
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~yo but <@!289944569410224129>  if you think a jacket like I linked could be dyed a good white, I might by up for buying one and commissioning that~~

~~Schnee Private Security~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nothing can be dyed white, you gotta find it in white. however a leather jacket thats not white can be painted white
Anna (Cadmium): nah you would have to bleach it so its not really possible. painting a whole leather jacket white would be a lot and could crack easily however
Anna (Cadmium): so basically fake leather, or gotta buy a white military jacket
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Back to impossible.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've never seen a white one.
Anna (Cadmium): theres gotta be one somewhere.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Military style. Never seen a white leather jacket in an appropriate style.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~sure but not in my size~~ <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Jess (whoozica): for men? yea its gonna be hard
Anna (Cadmium): ~~theres gotta be one somewhere~~ but theyre probs called like utility jackets
Jess (whoozica): or bomber jackets maybe
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't like bomber jackets look.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've been looking on Amazon and can't find anything decent
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and the closest thing is like $150
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah I’ve searched before. It’s a crapshoot.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hence the wishful thinking.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There were some white denim jackets but that's not really what you're going for
Jess (whoozica): ~~mens clothing options are pretty shit~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oof
Erik (Red Riot Thot): BIG MOOD

Jess (whoozica): do you wanna wear somthing other than jeans, slacks, t-shirts, button downs, or flannels? ha good luck
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I found that. It's pretty cool looking but it has one (1) sketchy review and not Prime eligible
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *so buyer beware*

Erik (Red Riot Thot): Anyone wanting to hear more about it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): #NewProfilePic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what a shit head
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): and he's going to Katsu??
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm gonna be on high alert
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Allegedly
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): oof I hope not
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Celeste said she was in contact with two conventions informing them about him. Not sure if Katsu was one of them
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But she mentioned he's supposedly going to Katsu
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): she didn't specify
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): at least not yet, haven't finished the videos
Anna (Cadmium): hhhhhhhhgh watched them. i hate ppl so much. protection squad for young ppl at cons assemble
Mark (Mad Doctor): So I was just wondering if Audrey is old enough to be on her own at Katsu. After watching the videos, I'm back in the Nope camp
Mark (Mad Doctor): Insane Overprotective Dad Man, standing by!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Correction: Is the con safe for Audrey to be on her own. I'm sure she's fine, it's these asshats who ruin cons for the rest of us who are the problem.
Anna (Cadmium): other cons not katsu, sure but rn like if shit like this is going down id say no just cause of shit going down. I mean. it makes sense you're worried but do you mean 'on her own' like without you or only her by herself
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'll let her hang with friends, but I want to make sure she can get in touch with me at all times. She has religious objections to a charged cell phone
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So... An idea I had been tossing around with Tom and Jess in another chat... Google maps gives you the ability to share your location with friends.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cross platform, real time updates.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Was discussing trying it at a con to keep track of friends.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Theres a Find my IPhone app too
Georgia (Something Sensible): its pretty accurate even within buildings
Anna (Cadmium): lmao buy her a battery pack phone case
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's not android compatible.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ik im just throwin out options
Anna (Cadmium): or an anker. I suggest Anker actually. theyre my fave brand of external battery.
Mark (Mad Doctor): She has lost three chargers this year alone...
Georgia (Something Sensible): what about those tiles that you can put on your keys
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Anker good shit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tiles work via bluetooth, they have a short range.
Anna (Cadmium): ..........keep it specifically for the con lmao 
put a nerdy sticker on it she wont lose it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Sew battery pack into props*
Anna (Cadmium): theres only one option guys.
Anna (Cadmium): 
Anna (Cadmium): im teaching you all how to use radio codes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): heh.
Mark (Mad Doctor): She's a smart kid. She knows that if she gets into trouble, she just has to make noise at a con and a posse will form
Anna (Cadmium): 10-4
Georgia (Something Sensible): _yeah itll be BNE and were gonna be there to buy merch and kick ass_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *weird kotori con clapping circle of safety*
Georgia (Something Sensible): *** and we already went to the dealers hall***
Jess (whoozica): Yea Audery is smart, and she isn't going to be whooed by some smooth talking boi either
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yup yup.
Mark (Mad Doctor): ...and we're all out of funds to buy merch
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 👀
Georgia (Something Sensible): /sobs about all the money ive spent while also beating up con creepers
Jess (whoozica): If anyone tried to touch Audrey is will stone them
Anna (Cadmium): cover him in tears so hes marked
Marisa (Mawisa): “Maroon alpha to all. 10-6 there is a caramelldansen conga line in front of reg and I am unable to proceed. Over.”
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I actually heard the walkie talkie beeps after reading that
Anna (Cadmium): no etiquitte is "Maroon alpha to IC"
"Go"
"Please be advised there is a 10-14 in front of reg."
"10-4 can you be more specific"
Marisa (Mawisa): Ok we’re gonna need a crash course

Marisa (Mawisa): I’ve been watching too much airforceproud95 on YouTube but his air traffic controlling isn’t perfect
Anna (Cadmium): "There is a caramelldansen conga in front of reg and i cannot proeed."
"10-4 can you please tell me your 10-35"
"North of Registration desk. by the Hatsune Miku sign."
"10-4, please advise on situation"
Anna (Cadmium): ~~im a fuckign loser who used to work radio comms for security~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~for 3 years~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *- looks up radio code-*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *... please tell me your Major Crime Alert*
Anna (Cadmium): 10-4 is yes 10-5 is repeat 10-6 is radio silence
Mark (Mad Doctor): Every kid who grew up in the 70's knew CB radio code
Anna (Cadmium): ~~kids these days dont even know what a floppy disk is besides a save button so~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You mean those 3D printed save buttons?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hell, I used to have a Commodore 64 with a cassette drive
