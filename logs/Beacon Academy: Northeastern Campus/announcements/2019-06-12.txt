Erik (Red Riot Thot): Based on what I saw from the apps, I'd say submit it under cosplayers because there's a field for crediting cosplayers. The artist one seems to be more for drawing art. But I'll let Lee give their input
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Wow, look at these amazing cosplayers <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
