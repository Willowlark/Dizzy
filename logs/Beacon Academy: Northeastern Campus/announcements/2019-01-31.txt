Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): @everyone the majority for fireball mountain is May 18th. As mentioned before there’s a 100 dollar deposit that goes down on this, non refundable so this is the “I’m committing to going May 18th” post. I’m not worried about actually splitting the bill anytime soon, I just don’t want to put 100 in and have everyone bail. (As for later in the summer, it’ll be pretty easy to book another day with them closer to August as that’s the middle of con season.)
🔫 for one (1) laser tag adventure
