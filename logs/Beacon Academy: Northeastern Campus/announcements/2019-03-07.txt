ZombieHunter: Hi I invited everyone I could on my phone to a new fb group for cosplay and photoshoot opportunities
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have a full time job and photography is my hobby... I don't like when people act like I have all the time in the world to work on photos.
Mark (Mad Doctor): What shoot/con is that for?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The group Hunter added everyone to has a monthly shoot as their goal; that's the policy on the photographers at each monthly meetup.
Marisa (Mawisa): is the group open to everyone
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): closed group, Hunter added everyone he could. If you didn't show up on his phone I can add you.
Marisa (Mawisa): o is ok
we arenâ€™t Facebook friends so I wouldnâ€™t show up
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~doxx Marisa for friendship goooo~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~25% off joannes coupon on the app excluding clearance and doorbusters rn~~
