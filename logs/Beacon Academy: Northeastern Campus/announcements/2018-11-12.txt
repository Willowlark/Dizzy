Erik (Red Riot Thot): Buy an Echo, get a Dot for free... Trying to convince myself I don't actually need it

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ooooh.
Matt (mattmyers25): Um car repair bills, you dont need it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I haven’t looked into Alexa much but the idea is something I like.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh I think that price is only for Prime btw
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, I also like the idea. Not sure what other uses I'd have for it other than playing music atm, but once I move out I definitely want to invest in some smart home things that it could be linked to. It'll probably be on sale again in the future so I think I'll hold off for now. Unless it goes even cheaper during Black Friday/Cyber Monday
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Alternatively this!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that seems more useful... tbh
ZombieHunter: FOR ANYONE NOT AWARE

After the long 24 hours that was the RWBY PJ party, I will be setting up a print shop with various cosplayer's photos I've taken in order to fundraise for my top surgery! 😄 

It would be SUPER helpful if people voted in my poll on IG pretty please >.>
ZombieHunter: i'm trying to find good places to buy 8x10s because they're EXPENSIVE >.>
ZombieHunter: I might do both. I'm not sure yet ;_;
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *~~ i has voted and if said prints involve some of my cutie friends I deff will at some point try to buy some~~
ZombieHunter: both Caseys, Georgia, and Leanna are in
ZombieHunter: I'm still messaging cosplayers I've shot with in order to get their permission :3
ZombieHunter: I'm not sure if anyone follows 7thlotus, but she's in. White Fang Cosplays is also in
ZombieHunter: hi meg i see you
