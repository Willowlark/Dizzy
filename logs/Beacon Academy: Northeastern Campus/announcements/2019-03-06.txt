Georgia (Something Sensible): quick someone give me a superhero that can reverse time
Mark (Mad Doctor): Superman, in the original movie
Jamie (Jamie): the flash, assuming just traveling time counts
Georgia (Something Sensible): nah gotta reverse time
Georgia (Something Sensible): im writing an article for how superheros break physics
Georgia (Something Sensible): essentially lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): dr strange?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i mean the flash regularly breaks physics with his time travel
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: anybody using the time stone
Jamie (Jamie): this is true specially in flashpoint
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah the flash fucks physics
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: real talk the flash's super power utilizes the speed force which is basically "go so fast you can warp all physics however you want"
Georgia (Something Sensible): The Flash: The Flash carried 532,000 people to safety 35 miles away during a nuclear explosion in Korea. He accomplished this is 0.00001 microseconds. He travelled 1,860,000,000,000,000,000 miles per second. The speed limit of the universe is 86,282 miles per second.
Georgia (Something Sensible): The flash is the BIGGEST PROBLEM CHILD
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: which actually ngl
Jamie (Jamie): but also # 5 in umbrella academy kinda does the time things as well and can seemingly take others with him if try hard enough
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: if you consider the theorizes on tachions or whatever there called
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: makes sense
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tachyon?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the theoretical particle that moves faster than light
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and in theory can also technically go back in time by doing so
Jamie (Jamie): the CW flash talks about those alot don't they? feel like only reason the word seems familiar to me a person not knowledgeable in sciences at all
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah cause they're basically  the closest scientific way of describing how the flash can move through time without complete bs
Georgia (Something Sensible): though techyons take a hammer to at least like 10 different laws of physics
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they're purely theoretical at this time
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah theres no many popular theories for travelling faster than the speed of light
Georgia (Something Sensible): theres more traction right now for there to be "pockets" that people can slip between
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~kinda like ravens portals~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): which would technically allow someone to cover distance at "faster than the speed of light"
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats now star trek explains away that one
Jamie (Jamie): on the subject though of heros messing with time though not a "superhero" max from life is strange
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh YEAH she's perfect
Georgia (Something Sensible): the principle im trying to demonstrate the theory that time acts like an arrow, and can never reverse
Jamie (Jamie): like even got some physical side effects going on with her for messing with times flow
Mark (Mad Doctor): The last few X-Men movies were heavy on time travel, but I don't think they gave a rationale
Georgia (Something Sensible): though nothing prevents us from jumping forward...
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah xmen too
Jamie (Jamie): number 5 from umbrella academy would be perfect for showing forward is easy while backward is tricky
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: wait wait
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Doctor Manhattan
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: literally
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the best fuck you physics hero ever
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah im trying to make the case relatively straightforward
Georgia (Something Sensible): superman flying around the world to make events "un-happen" is probably the best example
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: thats definitely the easiest to be like "yeah no thats not how it works"
Georgia (Something Sensible): oooo this is a tough one
Georgia (Something Sensible): conservation of energy/momentum
Georgia (Something Sensible): are there any superheros that just kinda crap out energy with no apparent source?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the flash
Jamie (Jamie): ...superman? tho i guess earths son is that
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: superman powers via sun
Jamie (Jamie): yea thought so
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: most have some form of explanation
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its usually mystical energy x
Georgia (Something Sensible): Phoenix? xmen?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: phoenix is technically a giant mass of energy thats built up throughout the universe (ie heat) with a conscious
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I mean, for conservation of momentum, you could use the "Superman turning the world around" example again because if he actually stopped the world turning on a dime everyone would fly off from the sudden stop in rotation
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^ used that for the principle of time being only one direction
Georgia (Something Sensible): Uhh Thor's hammer fucks momentum pretty well?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: thats why  when the x men split it between them they only have partial pieces of its matter
Erik (Red Riot Thot): isn't Mjolnir fixed in space and everything else moves around it?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or am I thinking of something else
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: depends on which one
Georgia (Something Sensible): technically the universe is infinite so any point could be a "fixed center"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): fuck
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: you want to deal with momentum or energy  in general
Georgia (Something Sensible): Antman and the Hulk?
Georgia (Something Sensible): did they ever explain how the could make their masses change without density shifts?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like Antman could work somehow
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Hulk has limtted strength technically and its based on the absorption of radiation proportional to his anger i think
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: antman fucks mass and density 100%
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Antman in the movies calls on 'pym particles' that can change the space between electrons in atoms
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: basically expanding the atoms in every molecule etc to allow physical size to increase
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: without changing the mass
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: at least thats what it claims
Georgia (Something Sensible): antman actually had its own science advisor wow
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: however antman shrinks to sizes smaller than electrons
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: like in antman and wasp
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: AND he grows to a giant size, and his weight and strenght seems to grow proportionally
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: plus his weight decreases significantly when he shrinks
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: cause he can ride ants
Georgia (Something Sensible): and he even goes to the quantum realm
Georgia (Something Sensible): which is its own mindfuck
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: meaning while they claim mass is consistent and conserved
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: in practice it definitely is not
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah, i think in principle he should have the same strength regardless of his size
Georgia (Something Sensible): google asks an interview question about what you would do if you shrunk down and put in a blender with 30 seconds to think
Georgia (Something Sensible): the simple answer is that you can just jump out because you have the same density, and thereby, the same jumping power, as your normal size
Georgia (Something Sensible): woooooooo science
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i mean you also should also break then blender when your dropped
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: cause if your shrunk down like antman (theory) style
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: imagine if a 180 pound wait hit something
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: with less than a square centimeter of area upon contact
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah all that force on such a small mass would shatter it
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think theyre assuming youre just gently placed in there
Georgia (Something Sensible): so the circumstances start from the second you find yourself in the blender
Georgia (Something Sensible): but i guess you could just punch the glass out too?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: probably
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the amount of damage a person with the same mass and density at teeny size would do is crazy
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: theoretically you could probably just stomp and break the whole thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): for superheros that use an aspect of fire, do the movies ever address how their bodies dont melt from the heat?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they're bodies are usually different in someway so they can withstand higher heat
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: most of them usually still have max temperatures
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its a lot of "on the molecular level... they've changed somehow" without much more
Mark (Mad Doctor): I remember a character from a superhero rpg that had fire powers and regeneration but no immunity from their own powers. They were messed up, to put it mildly
