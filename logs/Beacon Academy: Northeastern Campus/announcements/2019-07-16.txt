Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Second question, does anyone have space in their CCE room for wishcircuit and her friend Vivian. 
Vivian is tiny and quiet and the nicest person I've ever met, she likes video games and drawing. 

And wish is my best friend who some of you met at katsu orrrr RTX. 

I can vouch for both of them.
