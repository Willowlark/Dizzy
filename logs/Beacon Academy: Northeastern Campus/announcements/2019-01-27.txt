Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): @everyone Laser Tag at fireball mountain, call for interest. It is outdoor laser tag, you pay 25 dollars for an hour and a half of play time. We'd have to give them an estimate player count when we book the group session, so react
<:fingerguns:453385855470534657> for interested
🛑 for not
I'd expect to book this either spring or summer, on some weekend there isn't a con, given it outdoors. I'mma spitball late March, last weekend which is right after Zenkai? We'll pick three dates to decide on after we have a good number (they prefer your group is at least 10 people, though the guy on the phone said they make exceptions if you're one or two short.)

ZombieHunter: Depends when in March
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ill be in midterm hell in late March so it depends for me too
ZombieHunter: I have pax going on. April is better
Erik (Red Riot Thot): March'll be cooooooold
ZombieHunter: I have jack all in April
Marisa (Mawisa): Is this a cosplay event?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ooookay, ignore the date choice for now and just reply for interest.
Anna (Cadmium): End of May?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I didn't ask about cosplay, but I think we'd want a different scenario for cosplay. If you have 30+ people you can reserve a private field, while with the 10~15 group I'm expecting you play with other groups/walk ons.
Anna (Cadmium): I don't think. Cosplay would be a good idea for this
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But also that.
Anna (Cadmium): Unless u wanna go military versions of ya stuff but long hair plus Lazer tag is bad
Georgia (Something Sensible): sweat+wig=<:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Leanna's wig tangles around her neck and kills her*
Anna (Cadmium): Not even sweat just lazer tag stuff has lots of Velcro on it
Marisa (Mawisa): I wanna fight people in ruffles and giant petticoats
Marisa (Mawisa): Draw blood in a maid uniform
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Maybe if this goes well, we see the fields and gear, the people are nice there, we can talk about running a private event for cosplayers with a reserved field.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But for now no cosplay.
Marisa (Mawisa): If you cant shot me in heels and at least half a fur suit I won’t recognize you as my murderer
Marisa (Mawisa): [loli voice] “die, onii-chan”
That’s how laser tag goes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They resechedule in the case of rain, no charge.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I forgot to ask that but it in the FAQ.
