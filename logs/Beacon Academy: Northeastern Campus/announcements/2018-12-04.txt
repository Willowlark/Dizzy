Marisa (Weeb): crawls out of a hole
i like ruby and neon more than pyrrha because i hate how i look as pyrrha. neon is more an indoor costume because it's very hard to skate outdoors. if i'm outside especially in winter then ruby is better.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Your Pyrrha is good!
Marisa (Weeb): nah
Georgia (Something Sensible): Anyone interested in the BNHA panel at Zenkaikon, here's the info: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17obBnOMQXAxLlRk5WX3TMKv_xsY8qymbJUIFCCAwrUQ/edit
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me and Autumn and another of Autumns friends are hosting, and the top 9 submissions make it to the panel
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~but because im one of the judges for submissions hey at least you have a bias in me already lol~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): it says all the students of 1-A but honestly submitting for the villains couldnt hurt either
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm tempted since Chris does a baller Shiggy impression and I love being Toga
Erik (Red Riot Thot): having hero and villain interaction in a panel would be highly amusing
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im also like idk what my line up for Zenkai is 

Like I know I'm doing Toga, Winter, possibly Mina, and Ruby but idk when 

Maaaaybe Sypha from Castlevania since my roommate wants to do a trio
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have ochako, hera, a secret cosplay owo, and possibly some rwby chucked in there
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna do Mina since Chris wants to be Kiri and my roommate already does Bakugo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We have half a bakusquad right there
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But b o d y p a i n t
Georgia (Something Sensible): bodypaint is good for yooou
Georgia (Something Sensible): good for the soul
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I need to get a good palette so I can start practicing
Georgia (Something Sensible): honestly with body paint you just need that single color of whatever you need to be
Georgia (Something Sensible): and then a decent catch all contour palette
Georgia (Something Sensible): if you dont contour in body paint, it gets rid of a lot of your natural highlights and angles in your face
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~answering as Kirishima~*

**Favorite hobbies?**
*Hanging out with Bakugou*

**Best part of UA?**
*Being in the same class as Bakugou*

**Worst part of UA**
*When Bakugou is on probation :c*

**Favorite battle?**
*When I sacrificed myself for Bakugou and got turned into a meatball*
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel like maybe kirishima represses that last one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *but he got to be manly and protecc his boi*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Only thing I know of I want to do for Zenkai is Season 4 Blake. Everything else is up in the air XD
Jamie (Jamie): Mina is my for sure plan for zenkai and then the forever wip cosplay that seems will never get done at current financial rate lol my poor phantom thief lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Hey, so, I just learned that you can block comments that contain certain words so like, if you're tired of people calling you certain names in your comments, you can set it so neither you nor your followers can see said comments
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Figured it might be useful to some of y'all, especially the lady folk
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~did you block people from calling you Daddy~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I don't have need of it because no one ever comments on my posts~~
