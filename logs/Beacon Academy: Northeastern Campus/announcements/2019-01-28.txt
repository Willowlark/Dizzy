Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YO fireball mountain called me back. They LEGIT. They have a field with 35 buildings, a 2 story fort, woods, WWII trenches, the works. You play for an hour and a half in 10~15 minute sessions. They somehow have kill streak counters that can turn into drone strikes, respawn points, and assuming another group plays the day we do we can do BNE versus Scrubs. They won't put us with 9 year olds, period. It's a 100 dollar non refundable deposit for the res. We can book anytime in the year once we've chosen a date.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh, and they have different missions parameters, going from 'kill opponents' to 'protect VIP for 10 minutes'.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You do different missions on different fields as you keep playing.
