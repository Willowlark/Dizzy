Erik (Red Riot Thot): So idk how many of you listen to Judah and the Lion, but they just dropped their new album and it touches on their own experiences with mental illness and I know that's something some of y'all struggle with
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've been listening to it all day and it's pretty good but I haven't really sat down to listen to the lyrics too much, but some of them that I've caught some of the lyrics of are pretty powerful
Erik (Red Riot Thot): worth a listen
