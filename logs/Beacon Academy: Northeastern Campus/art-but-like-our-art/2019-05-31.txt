Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Shsggdhfgi reasons I need to clean up my art skills. What I could accomplish three years ago:

Jamie (Jamie): ~~anna is high tier god of art ~~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i feel that
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Anna is that angry pingu making art
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: The answer is years of practice my friend
Years and years of practice. We talking like. I've had the same box of colored pencils since 5th grade I just keep buying individual prismacolors when I run one down
you want fucking rwby chibi?: damn
Jamie (Jamie): And then one stop practicing and returns to art and questions if ever had the skills of old
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: YES THAT
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Like I'm p sure I lost my skills in a few mediums
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i just draw whenever my brain lets me have the Motivation brain cell AND the Inspiration brain cell at the same time, and i complain about art at All times
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: But it's hard to casually oil paint. I have a great painting of the Lincoln memorial still tho 

Ok that is also one hell of a mood
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: And it's usually whatever my hyperfocus is on
you want fucking rwby chibi?: like currently: all day ive been trying to complete 3 weeks worth of a month-long daily challenge and im dying inside
you want fucking rwby chibi?: Mood mood mood on the hyperfocus
you want fucking rwby chibi?: nearly all i can draw rn is danny phantom
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: But that's awesome
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I fucking love Danny phantom
you want fucking rwby chibi?: adhd says im Not Allowed to draw anything else
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Depression tells me I must sew or draw present mic and that's all
you want fucking rwby chibi?: dp's been my like. special interest for Years, n its also what started me on the path to my "current" art style
you want fucking rwby chibi?: <:valid:420824413592748032>
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I can see that. Honestly I used to reference it but idk what mine is most like these days but also. DP is the SHIT
you want fucking rwby chibi?: <http://fentonworkz.tumblr.com/tagged/phanniemay19> <:whelp:423360567084843009>
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I think I started experimenting with less sketch more clean lines when I was doing DP stuff actually now that I think about it 

O hello little link I I'll click u when wifi
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Tumblr eat data
you want fucking rwby chibi?: nice,,
i started messing around with shapes bc of dp and got the like. soft, round faces i have now from doing that

ive posted more art today/this month than i have in like. the past 6 months
tumblr stinkie.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I know up on Tumblr and post like. One thing. Then vanish into the void
you want fucking rwby chibi?: im stuck in the hellvoid that is tumblr
you want fucking rwby chibi?: even if im afraid of posting art half the time because of art theft
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: All my followers probs are just dead blogs but the effort of unfollowing and following my current interested is. A lot. But I don't wanna lose my old stuff.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Yeah I just. I should just turn it into cosplay stuff and art at this point. My old theme was so old the creator stopped running support on it three years ago
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I'm afraid of art theft too so I don't post either. It sucks.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i had the unfortunate experience of art(?) theft a few years ago when i posted an rvb meme that got like. SUPER popular within hours? and then got reposted to literally any site you could think of. 
and my dumb 18yo ass forgot to put a watermark on it. so trying to track reposts down and either ask for it to be removed or credited was even more of a nightmare
i had someone (who reposted from ifunny _back_ onto tumblr) backtalk to me that i "shouldnt be upset people want to share it" bc "thats what happens when you post stuff on the internet". i dont even remember if they took it down or not
you want fucking rwby chibi?: and since then it like. fucked with me and when i Do post art the watermark is huge and noticable bc i dont want that to happen again,
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Incredible
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Usually I just sign my stuff like right up against the lineart where it's important
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: But that sucks major ass and I also would be hesitant to post if that happened
you want fucking rwby chibi?: thats fair. i have a different way of watermarking every time i art practically tbh
yeahh :<
you want fucking rwby chibi?: it has like. 4k? notes last i checked. but i moved tumblr accounts a few months back so at least i dont have to see it appear in my notes every other day anymore
