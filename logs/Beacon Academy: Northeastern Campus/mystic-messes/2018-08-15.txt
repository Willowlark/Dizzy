Marisa (Weeb): jess u should try jaehee's route it's a trip <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): if you ever need more hourglasses to unlock additional routes i can help u get more hourglasses (legally through in-game means nothing shady)
but it will require grinding and you'll need a supply of them to get started
Erik (slendergiant): Marisa the Hourglass Dealerâ„¢
Marisa (Weeb): all about the DLC grind
Marisa (Weeb): you can get like 100 or so in under an hour maybe

Jess (whoozica): ðŸ™Œ
Jess (whoozica): get dem shower selfies
Erik (slendergiant): I am not creative when it comes to naming my characters
Jess (whoozica): it works!
Erik (slendergiant): Howmstever, it sometimes gets confusing when they say "Erika" and "Rika" in the same sentence xD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~it won't be confusing in the end~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also it's not about creative, it's nice to have a name that still feels close to yours while being genderswapped.
Jess (whoozica): oh yea i could see that
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): What's the closest name to Bill?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Bulma?
