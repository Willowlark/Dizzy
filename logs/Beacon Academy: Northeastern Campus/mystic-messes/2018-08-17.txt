Marisa (Weeb): If you miss a chat it’ll go on without you, it’s fine. Just don’t miss too many (like half in a day) or it’ll lead to a bad end
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): Nice 4th wall breaks 😂
Marisa (Weeb): *theyre real the rfa is real and they are our friends*
Erik (slendergiant): I got the Yoosung route
Jess (whoozica): WHOA
Jess (whoozica): yoosungs route to pretty good thou! it gets intense later on 👌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Why does everyone end up in the Yoosung route? 😂
Jess (whoozica): ~~not I~~
Jess (whoozica): its hard to be mean to him? ~~its hard to be mean period~~
Erik (slendergiant): It really is. Just let the poor boy enjoy his LOLOL
Erik (slendergiant): Howmstever, it is also fun to tease him with Seven...
Jess (whoozica): YEA too true, poor boi.
Jess (whoozica): yoosungs route is pretty emotional actually, more so than zens id say
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So is Erika also tall.jpg? Cause I bet Yoosung would be salty being shorter.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Or is he usually shorter than MC?
Jess (whoozica): i mean yoosung is like 5'6"?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's pretty short for a dude.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and given immature personality, he'd be salty about it.
Erik (slendergiant): According to some pictures I just spoiled for myself, MC comes up to about his nose
Jess (whoozica): yea mc isnt taller than any of the bois
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~dont do that you haven't seen the good stuff yet~~
Jess (whoozica): https://pm1.narvii.com/6565/0227fab140f8655575e573ed413fad472e67c1d0_hq.jpg
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I thought Jumin was taller.
Jess (whoozica): nah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Erik: Whose the blonde?~~
Jess (whoozica): he knows who she is!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh wait, they talk about her.
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah like, Day 1 xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): pfft
Erik (slendergiant): I thought V would be taller
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Isn't Yoosung's route like 90% "You aren't Rika, I like Rika"
Erik (slendergiant): Even though I'm not a big fan of Jumin, I kind of want to cosplay him so I can carry around a fluffy white cat xD
Jess (whoozica): i feel like these are a little off depending on weather you round up or down witht he conversion. cuz the panel said rika was 5'3"
Erik (slendergiant): ELIZABETH THE 3RD, MY ONE TRUE LOVE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I should have bet cash money*
Jess (whoozica): YES
Jess (whoozica): zens route made me a jumin fan
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think Erik could pull off Zen too, if he wanted.
Jess (whoozica): your opinions of the characters will change the more routes you do
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Welcome to MM hell~~
Erik (slendergiant): I also kind of wanted to do Zen too but I feel like the red contacts would be very key
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's all plain clothes which is Jess's excuse why she can cosplay 5 at the drop of a hat.
Jess (whoozica): alot of zens dont have them but yea i agree
Erik (slendergiant): TBH I'd cosplay any of the boys except Yoosung
Jess (whoozica): youd make a good V too but you dont see him much in the main story
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Erik for cosplaying Jaehee~~
Jess (whoozica): yea yoosungs are hard to find apparently opps
Erik (slendergiant): Nah, I'll do nun Seven
Jess (whoozica): YES PLZ
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I figure you'd have fun with Seven's trollyness.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It'd be like tapping into dad Taiyang mode and letting it run wild.
Erik (slendergiant): basically
Jess (whoozica): ~~V is RFA dad~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm talking about when Erik acts like Taiyang with the puns and finger guns.
Jess (whoozica): ye i know lol
Jess (whoozica): if you wanna try on my 707 stuff just let me know, all the stuff is large on me so it might fit you too! ill be getting a new wig eventually lols
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and if you get the jacket yourself, you can wear it to work all the time as a secret sign of your addiction!
Jess (whoozica): people just think its an umbreon jacket
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If only they knew.
Erik (slendergiant): lol
Jess (whoozica): my one co worker described it as "trendy"
Erik (slendergiant): 👌🏻
Jess (whoozica): and i was like "ah yes i am always at the forfront of fashion"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm covering from someone doing a series of data loads. It's like 5 commands I have to run and check they were loaded correctly.

One is called tineye.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You know what *I* read it as?
Jess (whoozica): SPOILERS BILLIAM
Erik (slendergiant): isn't that a reverse image search site?
Jess (whoozica): but also <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (slendergiant): whatever the reference is, I probably didn't get there yet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I never said a spoiler Jess.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I believe so.
Jess (whoozica): the reference is a spoiler tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The utility is claim verification, so it analyzes images.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Shots*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Fired*
Jess (whoozica): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Not with Seven, but close*
Erik (slendergiant): 😂
Jess (whoozica): this is for erik since he wanted seven first XD
