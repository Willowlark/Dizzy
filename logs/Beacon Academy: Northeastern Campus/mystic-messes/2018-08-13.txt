Erik (slendergiant): 707 winning my heart right now
Jess (whoozica): He's the fandom favorite! Precious dork ♥️
Jess (whoozica): Did you start with casual story? Or deep story?
Erik (slendergiant): Casual
Jess (whoozica): So in casual story you can only pick from jaehee, yoosung and zen. 707 and jumin are deep story.
Erik (slendergiant): Boooo
Erik (slendergiant): I did casual because it's *free*
Jess (whoozica): Yea, you don't wanna jump to deep without doing a few casual routes first anyway cuz you'll be lost later on in the game
Jess (whoozica): 707 has the deepest route so you def don't wanna do him first anyway or you'll be like "wat now"
Erik (slendergiant): Lol
Erik (slendergiant): How many times have you played this?
Erik (slendergiant): Or do I not want to know?
Jess (whoozica): I have played 6 routes 👌 all except jaehees including "another story" which adds two more characters you don't see much in the OG routes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She’s grade A trash.
Jess (whoozica): 😶
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): A real mess, if you will.
