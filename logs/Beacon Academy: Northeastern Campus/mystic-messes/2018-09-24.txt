Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Story skit: Mystic Messenger in real life:
Just 10 seconds of mystic messenger cosplayers sitting on a couch texting, with loud dings coming from their phones because they’re texting each other.
Erik (slendergiant): **Yoosung cosplayer:** *Wow, I can't wait to see you in person*
**MC cosplayer:** *Just look up lol*
Jess (whoozica): 👌
Erik (slendergiant): *[Embarrassed Yoosung emoji]*

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Your kidnapping play photoshoot from Ota is pretty much done. Need to do a last pass on my laptop, but finished it on the subway.
Jess (whoozica): ❤
Marisa (Weeb): You wanna do that scenario as a masquerade skit? <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): There was a super sweet one piece skit on Saturday that had a cool curtain reveal and that would be cool with mystic messenger
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I would have no part in masquerade skit, but I mean, you could steal the idea.
Marisa (Weeb): Eeeeeehhhhh!!?!??!!!!!?
