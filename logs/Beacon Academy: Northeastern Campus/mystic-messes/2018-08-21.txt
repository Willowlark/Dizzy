Erik (slendergiant): 
Jess (whoozica): HA
Erik (slendergiant): And yeah, you're right. Yoosung's stiry is getting pretty emotional
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *urge to make pun that’s also a poke at knowledge you may or may not have yet rising*
Jess (whoozica): Awww yeeee it's what day 9 now? What he up too? 😏
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I* don't know.
Jess (whoozica): I'm not asking you 😂
Erik (slendergiant): Day 8
Jess (whoozica): Ooo ok I forget exactly happens on which days
Erik (slendergiant): Today we found out Rika had a mental illness and then V went to visit Yoosung to apologize
Jess (whoozica): YEET
Jess (whoozica): Did they hug? I like when they hug
Erik (slendergiant): Yes!
Jess (whoozica): Blessed image
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You like when two hot men hug?
Jess (whoozica): BIRU PLZ
Jess (whoozica): It's completely wholesome and heartwarming
Erik (slendergiant): 
Jess (whoozica): There it is! Blessed image™
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): V: "..."
V: "I'm hugging you, right Yoosung? Not MC?"
Yoosung: "*sniffle* what?"
V: "Sorry... you're just so small, I got... momentarily confused."
Yoosung: "..."
V: "I'm blind."
Erik (slendergiant): *spoilers*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Is that what he actually says?*
Jess (whoozica): Lmao yea that's what he says totally
Erik (slendergiant): Well, they didn't reveal he was blind so I'm assuming that's a spoiler...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Isn't... that in his character bio?
Jess (whoozica): Maybe he no read the character bio
Erik (slendergiant): Where's the character bio?
Jess (whoozica): Like the wiki I guess? There's also like the little character image thingies in the opening but V doesn't have one in the main game
Jess (whoozica): ~~i don't even remember if they are in the opening~~
Erik (slendergiant): I just went back to the story part and it totally went over my head when Yoosung said "what's with the cane and the sunglasses" 😅
Jess (whoozica): Oh yea! Hehe
Jess (whoozica): That's just his aesthetic 😎
Marisa (Weeb): i found jumin

Marisa (Weeb): no ye V being blind is totally a spoiler <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): because i think only seven knows? or maybe not even seven. jumin is shocked when he finds out and gets really mad.
Marisa (Weeb): maybe only certain routes?
Erik (slendergiant): They haven't explicitly said anything yet. Yoosung just asked about the cane and sunglasses and then at the end said "what's wrong with your eyes? Are you hurt?"
Jess (whoozica): Yea I can't remember what's revealed on what routes so I'mma just wait for Erik to be like "omg this thing"
Marisa (Weeb): ahh yoosung.
Marisa (Weeb): rfa appreciation
