Marisa (Mawisa): :0
Marisa (Mawisa): mountain dew chan would have to be changed to be that sports drink modelled after girl's sweat/urine
they sell it in a vending machine on the first floor of the akiba donki store
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~~wait, what~~*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *oh that would energize me*

*to put the gun to my head*
Marisa (Mawisa): there's a very common sports drink everywhere called Pocari Sweat but people drink that all the time, it's in every machine everywhere
but there's one in akihabara that i'm trying to find a picture of that sells weird drinks
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i tried that one once. wtf is it even for
Marisa (Mawisa): athletes and people who run and stuff. replenishes electrolytes
Marisa (Mawisa): it's just poorly named
Marisa (Mawisa): i can't find a picture but i can tell you exactly where the machine is it's been there for years
Marisa (Mawisa): i can't find it rip but there was a vending machine by my house that sold bottles of soup broth and they had to rennovate it because tourists who didn't speak japanese would keep buying from it thinking it was soda
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Where'd you get that?
at the soup ~~store~~ vending machine.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): god i want to visit japan. but like. i am an english speaking idiot
Marisa (Mawisa): take me with u i help
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *No* we just got you back.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ill bring her back i promise
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~mag and I wanna japan we take u with us~~
Marisa (Mawisa): this building here where it says "IN"
go in there
turn immediately left as soon as you walk in
bam. anime girl sweat/urine-inspired water vending machine.
Marisa (Mawisa): enter on the left side though, the right side has a bunch of nail art booths and other vending machines
Marisa (Mawisa): dont forget to take selfies
Marisa (Mawisa): across the river is another group of vending machines that sell regular cookies and crackers, but what you get is random because they're covered in wrappers with either horror stories or very explicit nsfw stories printed on them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LOL Japan is wild
Marisa (Mawisa): or u can buy fake beetles
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...w-why
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Mawisa): just in case. u thirsty. u hungry. u want a beetle.
Marisa (Mawisa): some highway rest stops have pokemon vending machines!! they're cute
Marisa (Mawisa): u get a literal doll
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ooohh!! ðŸ˜®
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~is japan just SCP wonderland~~
Marisa (Mawisa): lots o vending machines
a lot of restaurants won't even take your order you have to order through a vending machine outside or next to the door. most ramen or donburi restaurants have them and you just give the staff the paper from the vending machine so you don't have to talk it's great
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I would love that. Cause I don't like most human interaction lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wow this is great i hate ordering things in person
Marisa (Mawisa): dont go into a fancier restaurant tho
the waitstaff don't check up on you, you have to call them over

some restaurants have a button that summon them, and a lot of anime cafes now have ipads that do all the ordering and waiter summoning. but mom and pop places you gotta shout "EXCUSE ME" to get their attention

there's nothing like a table of americans uncomfortable sitting around because they feel it's rude to shout and call the waiter over, but the waiter will never come by otherwise so they starve to death
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I would like that though. They don't bother me unless I ask them to. Good.~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): to be fair. I would be like. talking to myself in order to meet my brain's quota of words that come out my mouth
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Americans
afraid to be rude

now thats something to see
Marisa (Mawisa): you could go to a maid/butler cafe
they're way expensive and they charge an entry fee + you pay for each half hour you're there
but they play games with you and write cute stuff on your food in ketchup
Marisa (Mawisa): omg don't go to a host club though my old neighbor loved them and she would spend like $3000 a night going to host clubs
