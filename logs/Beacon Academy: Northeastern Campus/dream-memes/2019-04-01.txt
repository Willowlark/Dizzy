Anna (Blonde Banshee): hnnnng love those beans
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nah i dont like tea either
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): except like dunkin chai tea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): which isnt even tea tea anymore
Anna (Blonde Banshee): dunkin chai is an  unattainable happiness in a cup
Anna (Blonde Banshee): like.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): best beverage dunkin makes hands fuckin down
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its so fucking good
Anna (Blonde Banshee): and im counting their iced teas and that orange juice slushy thing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats the sole reason im a dunkin stan in the coffee wars
Anna (Blonde Banshee): I HAVE NO COFFEE LOYALTY
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that chai tea is unbeatable

Anna (Blonde Banshee): ok FIRST OFF
Anna (Blonde Banshee): i stan starbucks beverages pretty hard 
and
Anna (Blonde Banshee): no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'll kill you, kurtis. thats so incorrect. xD
Anna (Blonde Banshee): they are both so good but. the dunkin one is. special
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Understandable xD
Anna (Blonde Banshee): idk how they sweeten it and make it not disgusting
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): And haven't had dunkins in a while I'll have to recheck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im not going to pay an extra like 2 dollars for an adequate chai tea from starbs
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ok when was th last time u had one leanna
Anna (Blonde Banshee): cause they changed the recipe
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): when i could have a cheaper, larger, ***special*** chai tea from dunkin
Anna (Blonde Banshee): its much less sweet so its like 8x better than their original at starbs
Anna (Blonde Banshee): the dunkin one. has a different mouthfeel and weight to the liquid
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i had a starbucks one at geekdom
Anna (Blonde Banshee): the starbucks one, while delicious. is latte density
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i had a dunkin one last week
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and like ....nah fam im never paying extra for an okay at best chai from starbs again
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): however, starbucks has some lit baked goods
