Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Erik (slendergiant): Yup
Jess (whoozica): Yeet
Erik (slendergiant): Hence why I want to get business cards with my info so when they ask for pictures I can just hand them one. I WANT TO SEE THEM
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~You assume people read business cards~~
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Fact is the only people who read business cards are people who make them and want other people to read theirs. It's like a group guilt thing, if you don't read the other people's you'll never get yours read.
Erik (slendergiant): I mean, I usually read them
Erik (slendergiant): How else would I have know that one photographer worked with the famous Mangoloo cosplay?
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): > he appears behind you
> "I don't know much about RWBY."
> "But I know Mangoloo cosplay."
> *heavy breathing*
Jess (whoozica): i have them but i get about 20 pics taken and remeber to give a card like 3 times opps
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~20 is a good number you know~~
Erik (slendergiant): > sees Lainy and me dressed as Summer and Tai
> "Wow great Ruby Rose and... whoever you're cosplaying!"
Jess (whoozica): OOF
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): "Are you cosplaying Mangoloo?"
Erik (slendergiant): > "Here's my business card"
> flips it over to see a picture of Casey on the back
> Me: "Wow, there she is..."
> "OMG I forgot I had that on there!"
Erik (slendergiant): That guy was such a piece of shit ğŸ˜‚
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): oof. I need to establish a universal 'high sign' ya'll can give so I shuffle you out from weirdos under photographer pretenses.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm never sure if I should.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): or like, the safe word lol.
Jess (whoozica): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (slendergiant): Make the safe word *"mangoloo"*
Jess (whoozica): OMG
Erik (slendergiant): Just point off to the distance and be like "Oh look, there's Mangoloo!"
Jess (whoozica): and then run
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~oh look there's instagram famous wise rice cosplay~~
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): But also legitimately, if peeps don't want to be mean I can be under pretext of being professional. I just don't speak for anyone, so having the sign to cut off creep fan or weird photog is important.
