Evie (Katheryne Knight): DONT TEMPT MEEEEE
Marisa (Weeb): *do it*
Marisa (Weeb): peer pressure

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Actually <@!245270932602486784> you did Terezi right? 
If you ever wanna pull that out again I’ll GLADLY do Vriska with you.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: <:eyeslowkey:439577597983064084> <:eyeslowkey:439577597983064084> <:eyeslowkey:439577597983064084>

you want fucking rwby chibi?: oh nah i just wanna see georgia do terezi again lmao
you want fucking rwby chibi?: i have a vriska cosplay but i never wore it anywhere and i dont remember where my horns are anyway
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not the homestuck, anything but the homestuck. 😆
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me? TEREZI?
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ll never forgive them for breaking up the impromptu meeting Sunday of Zenkai year before last, with you Gen, Mark, Audrey.
Marisa (Weeb): did you walk around the whole con in the blindfold
Marisa (Weeb): we can make a lot of cupcakes for troll cosplays. with the frosting that turns your tongue a different color so we have canon tongue colors.
Jamie (Jamie): I'm kinda actually wanting homestuck group to be a thing partially to scare people because of how bad a name homestucks have now.  But also and mostly cuz fuck yes.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: id do homestuck cosplay again but its mostly the Interacting With The Fandom part that scares me tbh
~~theres a handful that i know that are ok but i dont know how the fandom as a whole like time travelled back to 2012-2013~~
Marisa (Weeb): Maybe it’ll be a nostalgia thing for people who’ve grown up. Like “WOAHyoure from that comic I read when I was 10!”
They’d be a lot older now
Marisa (Weeb): Only one way for sure to know how people react <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Trust me <@!170686358535274497> I honestly wouldn't go to any photoshoots/big gatherings I'd just pal around with some stucks. There's a person in the Homestuck fandom that's kinda well known for Snowman that is...probably the most problematic, disgusting human on the planet, and I'd rather not interact with her.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: thats valid as hell
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like, if I ever went to a Katsu one I'd be safe because she's not going to Katsu anymore, but Zenkai is OUT.
Marisa (Weeb): Seriously? :0
Oh noooo. Ive never heard of that. Are they long term problematic or recent?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Uuuuh idk if you know them because they think they are popular but they really aren't. They are like...one of the only Snowman cosplayers out there.
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah snowman cosplayers are rare. I’ve likely seen them around
Erik (slendergiant): I had to look up who Snowman was but I think I know who you're talking about about...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You provabl do <@!386874959009415170>
Erik (slendergiant): I think I've only met her a few times because she was friends with someone I went to college with who is also a very toxic person. So I don't know her *too* well to make any judgments, but she gave off bad vibes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeaaaaah she’s toxic with a capital T
Erik (slendergiant): **Toxic**™
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Not the Brittany Spears kind
Erik (slendergiant): https://pics.me.me/let-us-mourn-he-with-a-traditional-ballad-britney-spears-25071948.png
