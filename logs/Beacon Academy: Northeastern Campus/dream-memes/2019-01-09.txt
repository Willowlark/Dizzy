Anna (Cadmium): of those series
Anna (Cadmium): actually its worse cause i saw only the third lotr cause i got dragged to the theater

Mark (Mad Doctor): This folk/punk band from NY college days always reminded me a little of Weezer
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rT6lOhVa8LM
Anna (Cadmium): ok thats impressive
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They're super long soo XD When I watched them we had to break each movie up into separate days lol
Jess (whoozica): I have one seen 2 harry potters
Anna (Cadmium): team "somehow missed all intro movies into nerd culture" unite!
Anna (Cadmium): at this point its not worth seeing <@!351471675843411978>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ books are better anyway if you want to actually get into harry potter but ....idk the hype is mostly passed
Jess (whoozica): which is getting weird now cuz toms mom seems to think i love harry potter all of a sudden and im afraid thats gonna be all my christmas gifts for years to come
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omfg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Rebecca (madameterralupus): To be fair though, most people have seen Harry Potter... I've only seen 2 of them. Half of the third D:
Been meaning to finally watch them but keep forgetting T_T I enjoy what I've seen just was banned form them growing up sooo kinda out of that nerd loop lol
Jess (whoozica): she got me a hedwig plushie? and like thats fine cuz i like owls but i hope this isnt a new trend
Anna (Cadmium): i feel that HP is where a lot of ppl stop in their nerd venture and dont ever continue on to other nerd series.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what made her think you like harry potter?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): XD
Jess (whoozica): i have NO idea
Anna (Cadmium): lol maybe shes just like. This one likes nerd shit HP is a safe bet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im fucking laughing so hard
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "she does that cosplay thing right? isnt that harry potter?"
Jess (whoozica): yea thats the only thing i can think?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like Harry Potter stuff but don't know enough as most fans do. Most I learned from watching the few movies I have (and some bits of others on tv) or friends XD.... I guess im a fraud when it comes to that fandom XD Some day I wil get aroudn to actually watching them. Just need to find the time D:
Jess (whoozica): maybe she saw me comment on my friiends post from when she went to the harry potter museum in england but i even prefaced the comment with "im not even into HP but..."
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"If thou doth wish to destroy my chainmail
Rupture this link as I depart thy presence
Gaze as I breaketh, I shall soon be unclothed
Lying upon the earth
I hath become undone"*
Anna (Cadmium): to be fair. with the way JK rowling is goign mabye its worth never finishing the series lmao.
Anna (Cadmium): are we all just frauds
Anna (Cadmium): i also only saw Alien: Covenant
Jess (whoozica): i havent seen any of them!
Anna (Cadmium): ~~and none of the others~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The Wizarding World franchise is heading into a steep decline and it makes me sad
Anna (Cadmium): i didnt even want to see it, it was just like $5 tuesday movies
Anna (Cadmium): they squeezed it for too much money its going downhill <@!386874959009415170>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jk rowling is .....doing some weird shit too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): There's a lot of nerdy stuff I wanted to get into growing up but my mom was kinda anal about things being "evil" and shit. So wasn't allowed. I had to sneak my way around into reading or watching them XD (She gets it from her mother. Still is a bit that way but better now, plus I'm an adult sooo)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The last Fantastic Beasts movie was full of plot holes and continuity errors
Erik (Red Riot Thot): All fan service
Anna (Cadmium): its like. no longer beating a dead horse its more like archaeologists are uncovering the remains of a severely abused equine.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Did  you read the Pottermore tweet about how wizards used to go to the bathroom before they decided to use muggle plumbing?*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what the fuck
Anna (Cadmium): "we shit on the floor like bears"
Anna (Cadmium): um. no honey
Jess (whoozica): I was pretty sheltered as a kid i guess youd say? not intentionally by my parents i just wasnt exposed to much cuz we never really went anywhere and i only had like 2 friends
Erik (Red Riot Thot): For those that didn't, basically they just pissed and shat themselves and magicked the mess away
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao what?! That's so gross XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thank Gof for muggle plumbing
Mark (Mad Doctor): So, last night, Audrey and I went to see "Beautiful: The Carole King Story." It's set in the world of pop music production in the 50s and 60s, but at one point, a character clearly said "Hewwo?" Audrey lost her shit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 50/60's weeb!
Anna (Cadmium): to be fair i would also lose my shit

Jess (whoozica): i saw it in school?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omfg xD really?
Mark (Mad Doctor): When you know the parody better than the original.

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I keep meaning to see Space Balls. I'm surprised I haven't. I was supposed to at one point but never got around to it..? ðŸ¤·
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shrek is incredible though
Jess (whoozica): yea i cant remember what class we watched it in one of the students brought it in and the teacher was like "sure w/e"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats incredible
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Those teachers are the best XD
Jess (whoozica): you know it was prob my music teacher in middle school
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i was literally just thinking about how my music teacher in middle school played the sound of music
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and how thats the only thing i remember from that class
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): literally nothing else
Jess (whoozica): mine was like an ex hippie and taught us all 60s and 70s music
Jess (whoozica): he was coo
