Marisa (Mawisa): Just wait until you see my frustration with the violin
Marisa (Mawisa): It’s so bad the camera lighting changed color
Marisa (Mawisa): If I can’t figure out how to properly play (this thing is cheap and can’t hold a tune which is part of the problem) I’ll just walk around as Ray doing what I did in my insta story. Chicks dig that dramatic angsty violin screech.
Jess (whoozica): YES
Jess (whoozica): thats like legit all you need to do
Jess (whoozica): the fact that you have the violin is allready gonna be impressive
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Jess will fall for you*
Marisa (Mawisa): If anybody creeps on you as MC I’ll come up and play off-tune in their ear
Marisa (Mawisa): 🕺
Jess (whoozica): YES
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I like that last second eye roll after the flute 👌👌

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not a clue, i dont really deal with her often enough for it to affect me either way
Georgia (Something Sensible): make a recovery post "HAHAH NEITHER ITS BEES"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i was just looking at the responses and i saw that and was like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "oh dear"
Jess (whoozica): oh ok well then i guess thats ok

Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey came out to us in fifth grade. She said something like "I just find the boys in my grade gross." We told her we were happy she trusted us enough to tell us, but the fact that fifth grade boys are gross has little to do with anyone's gender identity
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 5th grade boys are gross regardless
Mark (Mad Doctor): Like a universal constant
Jess (whoozica): I've had crushes on boys since i was like 5 yrs old im furiously straight it shows 😭
Erik (Red Riot Thot): As a middle school boy, even *I* didn't want to hang out with middle school boys lol
Anna (Cadmium): ~~when do they stop being gross I grew up in a rural place and i went to engineering school so i dont know~~
Jess (whoozica): i mean most of the boys were icky but like there was ussually one boy that wasnt XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): like by 8th grade my best friends were the 3 girls in my class lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~that was me~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *who had friends in middle school*
Anna (Cadmium): thats okay i think ppl knew before i did cause i looked at a twilight poster and said that kristen stewart was hot
Jess (whoozica): ~~tru tho~~
Anna (Cadmium): and like okay she was aesthetically pleasing but also. i did say hot
Anna (Cadmium): ~~who had friends in middle school indeed~~
Jess (whoozica): i was never actually friends wth boys till like high school tho
Jess (whoozica): ~~cuz they was mean to me~~
~~or ignored my existence~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I had aggressive crushes on my female "best friends"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but didnt realize it until highschool
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and then i was like "oh shit das gay"
Jess (whoozica): das gay!
