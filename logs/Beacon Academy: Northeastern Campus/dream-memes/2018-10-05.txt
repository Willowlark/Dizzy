Marisa (Weeb): Minetas room has creep shots of all the girls wow
Marisa (Weeb): Midoriya has SO MANY framed pictures of all might. Not posters but like internet screenshots printed and framed.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol a mood
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also lol where are you?? O.o Some BNHA event?
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah they’ve got a museum open until Monday and it’s a holiday weekend so I was like “go now before school”
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh that sounds really neat!
Marisa (Weeb): He has a straight up photo album because his framed pictures aren’t enough
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ME XD
Marisa (Weeb): It’s where cosplay events are usually held so it’s super weird not seeing any cosplayers today
Marisa (Weeb): Todoroki’s wish is to eat more soba
Marisa (Weeb): 
Marisa (Weeb): All Might going into Midoriya’s room for a fatherly talk and its just too unnerving having pictures and posters and pillows and figures of yourself staring at him from literally everywhere. There’s a really sweet Tsuyu figure coming out soon for $180 though

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~more like one~~
Erik (slendergiant): Ruby's a main character?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): What’s character development
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~tbh I’ve always liked Weiss and Blake more sooooooooooo~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~Oh and JNPR~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~And everyone else~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^~~same~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ruby is least likely to get character development, but also the one best suited to not get any.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): As the main character and genki girl, her being able to be everyone else's rock as they ~~suffer~~ go through their characters arcs does make sense. She's *special* because she's the one who never gives up hope.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly like I like Ruby but she’s not my favorie if that makes sense
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im only cosplaying her because one of my best friends wants so@wine to be her Ruby to her Oscar
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And I volunteered
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cause she’s one of my best friends
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And I’m a slut for having fun XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~That however implies that RT can write a character arc for anyone~`
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fuck.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I reshare a meme I know <@!229713389511901185> will appreciate, until I realize I got it from her facebook post.
Marisa (Weeb): what's a sheetz it sounds bad
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YO is there one of these for Coffee?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sheetz is like wawa/quickchek/7-11 but better.
Marisa (Weeb): not in the tumblr post it came from
Marisa (Weeb): what's a quickchek
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): FALSE
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Wawa is better than sheetz
Erik (slendergiant): like a Wawa but their ordering system uses Times New Roman
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nah. Sheetz (they have booze and way more stuff) > Quickchek (subs) > idc between 7/11 and Wawa.
Marisa (Weeb): japan's 7/11 is the best but wawa is far superior to US 7/11
Marisa (Weeb): sheetz selling alcohol automatically ranks it bottom
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): wait you put quickcheck over wawa?
Erik (slendergiant): ~~Sheetz in PA don't sell alcohol??? At least the ones I've been to???~~
Marisa (Weeb): although every conbini in japan has an alcohol  aisle
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): sales of Alcohol depend on state laws
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): not store specific
Erik (slendergiant): ~fuck PA~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I thought the PA ones do.
Erik (slendergiant): I know in NY you can get alcohol at fucking CVS
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You can get alcohol in NY *anywhere*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pretty great.
Marisa (Weeb): maybe it varies by county?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Jersey getting a liquor license is impossible but if you have one you can sell. IE, there are two quickcheks built on properties with a license, so they sell booze.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): One is next town over.
Erik (slendergiant): We've only just started getting beer and wine in some of our grocery stores. Not sure if any laws passed recently that more are following suit or what the actual current laws are
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): PA also has stupid liquor laws.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They have a lottery to get pappy van winkle.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *speaking of*
Jess (whoozica): WAIT
Jess (whoozica): what QC sells alcohol biru?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Netcong.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Netcong is where I get my lunch from.
Georgia (Something Sensible): My college campus alone has 3 Starbucks, 2 Dunkins, and a Starbucks truck
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s more Starbucks than all your county WHOA
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): #theboonies
Georgia (Something Sensible): Poor deprived rednecks
Georgia (Something Sensible): At least you get Dunkin’
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You calling me a *redneck*?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m calling Sussex county a redneck!
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Sussex by definition is redneck
Georgia (Something Sensible): At Rutgers, I’m the only truck in the parking lot, in Sussex, that’s the only car that exists lol
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): no matter what state its in, sussex is always the redneck county
Georgia (Something Sensible): _even in england_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the "north jersey" subsect on that map bill made should just be called  "rednecks"
