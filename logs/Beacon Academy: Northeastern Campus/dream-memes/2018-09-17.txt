Marisa (Weeb): Look at this dog.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ROUNDBOI
Erik (slendergiant): That's a dog?

Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Marisa (Weeb): *what are you suffering from*
the world may never know
Erik (slendergiant): That's why I just ignore all calls that I don't know
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This one has been calling constantly.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There was a thing on the voicemail for getting on a do not call list, so I answered this time.
Erik (slendergiant): If it's important, they'll leave a voicemail. If it's a spam number and they keep calling I block them
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I tried blocking it, still went through.
Erik (slendergiant): Weird
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm just going to accept, then scream at the person who picks up.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like a *psychopath*.
Erik (slendergiant): I'll often look up the number afterward and see if it's posted to a spam call list
Erik (slendergiant): The ones I *know* are spam are the ones that are the same area code and first 3 digits of my own number
Erik (slendergiant): Those I immediately reject within .25 seconds
Erik (slendergiant): > Unknown number calls
> Goes to voicemail
> Was a recruiter I was playing phone tag with about a month ago and never heard back from
> "This position opened back up and I was wondering if you were still available for consideration. Give me a call back"
> Calls back
> Gets voicemail and starts new game of phone tag
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof. Good luck on getting in contact with them!
Erik (slendergiant): thanks. I added her to my contacts so I know to answer next time 👌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm that's a smart move. Hopefully you hear back from her soon.
