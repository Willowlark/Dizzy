Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof
you want fucking rwby chibi?: oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I do not match up to what this is saying of my sign XD I'm like always early. ~~Twice now I stopped at a Starbucks to chill a bit before arriving to your house lol~~
Jess (whoozica): I don't match either, I'm late, I'm still commin
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Lol I'm always late
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I would like to petition to have mine changed to â€œshows up casually ~~with Starbucks~~ â€œ
Georgia (Something Sensible): leo is pretty accurate
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have no excuse
Georgia (Something Sensible): i must go through an alternate dimension that makes me late when i drive
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I feel that on a spiritual level
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I have my car clock set 8 minutes fast because it makes me show up relatively closer to on time
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Thatâ€™s assuming you werenâ€™t already that late BEFORE you got in your car
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Yeah it only kinda works
Georgia (Something Sensible): well if you see youre already 8 minutes later than you thought you were, youd probably drive faster
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): As soon as I get in the car I'm usually 100% will arrive when intended
Georgia (Something Sensible): its not a stupid idea if it works
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Mine's inaccurate. It should be "shows up 15 minutes early but waits in the car for ten minutes before going in"
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I just need to get to said csr
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I do that sometimes lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): ive given to setting my bedside clock 15 minutes earlier because if i wake up late, it takes 15 mins to get anywhere on campus
Georgia (Something Sensible): somehow it works because i have that jolt of OH FUCK before i realize
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Jess (whoozica): ðŸ˜­
Jess (whoozica): Why didn't you guys tell me I was a jerk?
