Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I CAN'T WAIT FOR ROXAS AND VENTUS TO MEET
Evie (Katheryne Knight): LORD IM NERVOIS IF IT HAPPENS
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Roxas is literally what happens when you fuse sora and ventus
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Actually I'm lowkey worried that roxas is going to merge into ventus
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im pretty sure they explained why Roxas looks like Ventus
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Because Sora has 8 people inside him like idk he knows himself anymore
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): "The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus's heart entered Sora's body, and that Roxas's birth allowed Ventus to influence his appearance."
