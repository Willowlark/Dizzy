"Bill Clark (25) has ignored the meeting request he just received on slack by opening instagram for desktop. He watches the two stories posted by people he doesn't care about, then closed the tab and opens Facebook. Seeing no posts and being out of social networks, he closes that tab and reopens instagram, hoping in the last 10 seconds someone has posted something else to keep his interest.

More at 11."
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "Erik Bjorken (25) continues to abuse his use of the company 3D printer and with his boss being absent today, he has the freedom to print as he pleases. He is actually being somewhat productive aside of that, but didn't really start doing any actual work until about 2 hours and 7 minutes *after* clocking in."

Erik (Red Riot Thot): "December 18, 2018, 10:30am: Leanna Malure (23) comes to the realization that William Clark (25) and Erik Bjorken (25) are the same age. She is utterly baffled and needs a moment to recuperate after such a mind-blowing discovery."
