Jamie (Jamie): Least we aint alone in such things
Jamie (Jamie): Anyone else do that and have ten alarms set as well?
Marisa (Mawisa): all at once or within 2/3 minutes of each other with increasing frequency?
Jamie (Jamie): 5-10 minute intervals xD
Marisa (Mawisa): my school used to give out alarm clocks as prizes for stuff every year. i have one that yells at you. after that there was one that launches a tiny helicopter in the air and won't turn off unless you physically get up and put the copter back on the dock.
Jamie (Jamie): Its reason most night during the week i sleep in my own room and not with jason lol
Jamie (Jamie): Oh yea that heli one i kinda have wanted before xD

Marisa (Mawisa): omg yours has a cat
Jamie (Jamie): I should be leaving for work by 8 30 buuut I instead rush out and make it to work exactly on time if not a minute or 2 past
Jamie (Jamie): Yes my phone is cat theme i love it
Jess (whoozica): im always like 5 mins late but no ones cares
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i have one alarm... but then i lay in bed and look at memes and social media for 20 mins
Jamie (Jamie): Jason is weird to me cause he wakes up and can dress and walk right out the door imediately while im dragging myself to coffee
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....20 mins was too low... its usually closer to 30
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): When I started working I had a vintage bell alarm clock and a digital clock I would set every day.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I've eliminated the bell clock, and wake up the digital one.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): A year and a half in the making.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I find dedicated alarm clocks work better imo.
Jamie (Jamie): Most of my alarms I'm pretty sure just get snoozed in my dreams like i sleep snooze and in my dream i've slapped a screaming person to shut up or something lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): First alarm is set for 6, second alarm is set for 6:10 (with automatic light now), I get up, shower, eat breakfast, make lunch, go back to bed until 7:20, then snooze twice for 5 minutes until 7:30, then get back up, get dressed, and finish getting ready. Leave for work by 7:40ish
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have a very convoluted morning routine üòÇ
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Woooah
Tom (tomukuncosplay): You go back to bed?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): That's nuts
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Mine is.. do everything the night before and wake up with 8minutes to leave and zoom
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BIG SAME
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats how i have 30 mins to look at memes
Jamie (Jamie): I remember in school my mum occasionally found me after my morning shower in a towel past out on the bathroom floor cause young me was like fuckit I'm tired floor is now bed
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I *would* just wake up later if it wasn't for the fact that that's basically the only time I can shower in the morning
Jamie (Jamie): This brings the inguiry of evening shower instead? Sleep more?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I can't do evening showers because I wake up and feel gross anyway
Jess (whoozica): I do morning showers in the summer, but in the winter ive been doing evening showers cuz my bedroom is cold as shit and i wake up and really dont wanna get wet
Marisa (Mawisa): every day i scroll down to see if Time Chronicles‚Ñ¢ has updated and every day i am let down

Marisa (Mawisa): YEAH WOOOO
Marisa (Mawisa): THE RETURN IS IMMINENT
Marisa (Mawisa): WOOOOOOOO
Jamie (Jamie): 
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Ditto to Erik, I need a morning shower.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I can be done with my morning routine in about 20-30 minutes.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I get up an hour before the train, the train 10 minutes away, which leaves me the 20 minutes to snooze my alarm.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): NGl, through school I thought snooze buttons were stupid, cause why not just keep sleeping. I find it's easier to get up if I snooze one or two times.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *Wake not the sleeping dragon*
Jamie (Jamie): https://youtu.be/I8LzAVmBxYw
