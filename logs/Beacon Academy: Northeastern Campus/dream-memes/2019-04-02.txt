Mark (Mad Doctor): Just got this from Chris! My school already divides students into houses. We even name prefects (my house, Washington, may break w ten years of tradition and name two female prefects next year, instead of one of each gender). In my homeroom, three out of ten students had never read a HP book or seen a movie. *They're too young...*
