Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): IM WHEEZING
Georgia (Something Sensible): I FOUND AN SD CARD IN MY DRAWER AT HOME
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): this IS ALL THATS ON IT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Fucking Bakguo looks like coconut head
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hamsteaakkk
Georgia (Something Sensible): _just homestuck_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's the special homestuck sd card. Only homestuck can be on there
Georgia (Something Sensible): its from a digital camera i got like 6 years ago
Georgia (Something Sensible): ... huh you know id probably get better vlogs off that camera
Georgia (Something Sensible): now thats a thought
Georgia (Something Sensible): its just been sitting in my drawer for years
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Probably not.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Modern phones have impressive quality.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): A camera from 6 years ago may give you worse quality, and thatâ€™s just with pictures. Video technology will be even worse.
Georgia (Something Sensible): so a camera from 6 years ago is basically worthless
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah, you know, thats about when everyone had a camera in their phone
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Use it as a prop?
Georgia (Something Sensible): what should i do with it o.o
Georgia (Something Sensible): it was probably expensive i feel bad
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean you could probs use it for some video but may not be the best quality now a days
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Prop for Max, if you ever do her again.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Recycle it after checking the tech specs to be sure my theory is right.
Georgia (Something Sensible): omg it was like 200 dollars back in the day ðŸ˜¢
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thatâ€™s... not much.
Marisa (Mawisa): blessed hd card
Georgia (Something Sensible): das a lotta money to me, i remember my mom got this as a christmas gift
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Cyber-shot-DSC-W690-Digital-3-0-inch/dp/B006K554I2?th=1
Georgia (Something Sensible): dats the camera
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Still a decent amount ðŸ¤· ~~lol but then again anything over 100 is yikes to me kinda~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah those little digital cameras have become pretty moot nowadays then havent they?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It'd prob not be the best quality now a days but you could still use it for video some if don't want to use phone or whatever. I am sure it's still a passable quality. Maybe film some stuff and compare to your phone?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 200 for a camera is cheap these days. My intro level Nikon was 6 to 8 on Black Friday deals.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The sensor is 16mp, which is somewhat better than your phone.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It also has 10x zoom.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): However video would but 720p rather than 1080p.
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel so bad, my mom got me this expensive gift forever ago and now its not really worth anything to me ðŸ˜­
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel like a wasteful rich kid
Georgia (Something Sensible): i mean it got a LOT of use when i was younger but like
Georgia (Something Sensible): ahhhh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol don't worry Georgia. I do the same with electronics XD
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Zoom probably only reason to use it over phone.
Georgia (Something Sensible): to spy on people <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Electronics get old and become obsolete.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My parents got me an xbox one year cause I really wanted one... I like...never play it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It happens.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Itâ€™s called Mooreâ€™s law.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~im gonna hold onto it for now because it still sparks joy for me to think about~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Sure, that.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Have a camera isnâ€™t a bad thing.
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i just get frustrated with how much junk i have in my room that i dont use
Georgia (Something Sensible): but like, then i come to items like these where im like ðŸ˜­
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I need to get rid of my portable dvd player... who uses that anymore. I got a damn computer lol~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^ my family took one we had to some tech thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): we use consoles to play dvds for the most part
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You barely have time to breath this semester.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): estimate what you use and what you donâ€™t after you remember what free time is like.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): To help clear out stuff hording up space imma see that if I don't use it within this year... it's gotta go.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like my 3ds... I cant even tell ya that last time I touched that ðŸ¤·

Georgia (Something Sensible): ðŸ™Œ
Marisa (Mawisa): Achievement Unlocked: <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
