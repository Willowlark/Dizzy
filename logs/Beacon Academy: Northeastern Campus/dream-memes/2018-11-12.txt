Marisa (Weeb): How many times has that happened to poor clerks 
“Hi yes I’d like a refund these didn’t work” puts a box of used condoms on the counter
Halim (Greg): Ew
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I would scream.... gross
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Weeb): Burn the store down. No other choice.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): ☝
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yep
Halim (Greg): idk
Halim (Greg): you could freeze the store
Halim (Greg): put the whole thing on ice
Marisa (Weeb): “Look sephiroth naruto deku ichigo Smith. That’s the store that got burned down because of your existence.”
Georgia (Something Sensible): these are just hilarious hearing other peoples experiences
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is that my future son you just named Marisa? 😱
Halim (Greg): ~~also imagine todoroki getting icy hot condoms so he can try and have a normal, evenly temperatured peen when sex~~
Marisa (Weeb): Yes he called me and said to tell you hi
Georgia (Something Sensible): why do these exist
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~other than fulfilling todoroki fantasies~~
Halim (Greg): ~~small dicks need something to spice them up~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): lets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, set the peen on fire
Marisa (Weeb): Also you’re out of eggs and he needs someone to pick him up from band practice
Georgia (Something Sensible): brilliant marketing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): While we on the topic of condoms... why do flavored and glow in the dark exist like... 🤔
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Flavored I can get but glow in the dark? XD
Marisa (Weeb): People are Sin
Halim (Greg): flavored ones: blowjobs
Glow in the dark: Helps with aim
Marisa (Weeb): I don’t understand lewd stuff do people just pelt rocks or darts at condoms
Halim (Greg): yes
Tom (tomukuncosplay): yes
Halim (Greg): specifically nerf darts
Marisa (Weeb): Nice. That should be a sport. Adult sport not for children.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *let me light up that pussy!* -puts on glow in the dark condom-
Georgia (Something Sensible): DONT SLAM GLOW IN THE DARK
Georgia (Something Sensible): THEY ARE HILARIOUS
Georgia (Something Sensible): LIGHTSABER PEEN IS G9
Halim (Greg): you don't want to accidentally tear the condom
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lol really? It can't be that bright though to help with aim too much 🤔
Halim (Greg): i've never had a glow in the dark condom work
Georgia (Something Sensible): rebecca i own many glow in the dark condoms come to my place 😏
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Halim (Greg): i have been thoroughly disappointed by them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👀
Marisa (Weeb): Throw more stuff at it
Georgia (Something Sensible): flavored isnt great
Georgia (Something Sensible): i stand by that
Georgia (Something Sensible): also side note why isnt this convo in NSFW
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cause we all adults here so meh
Tom (tomukuncosplay): :3
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): glow in the dark condoms are for lightsaber duels and nothing else
Halim (Greg): Flavored is a great idea
until you realize flavored condoms really just means flavored lube
and there is no such thing as good tasting lube
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We only made nsfw cause Audrey and she isn't in here anymore
Halim (Greg): _I SEE YOUR SCHWARTZ IS AS BIG AS MINE__
Georgia (Something Sensible): agreed
Halim (Greg): yeah everyone is of age so as long as it isn't visual content then like
Georgia (Something Sensible): flavored condoms should just be flavored lube
Halim (Greg): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Tom (tomukuncosplay): todoroki was lost somewhere in this conversation
Georgia (Something Sensible): todoroki will be found again do not worry
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I'll pass on flavored anything cause I hate blowjobs so xD~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Halim (Greg): ~~a nice dick tastes better than flavored lube anyways~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): all quirks in the bedromo makes things complicated
Georgia (Something Sensible): whoa what
Georgia (Something Sensible): dick does not tasTE GOOD WHOS CANDY PEEN HAVE YOU LICKED
Georgia (Something Sensible): not ALL quirks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Dick tastes like over cooked rubbery chicken.... and I'll stand by that forever 🤢
Georgia (Something Sensible): w h a t
Halim (Greg): 1. I didn't say it tasted good 
2. I said its better than flavored lube
Georgia (Something Sensible): what dick are yall contacting
Tom (tomukuncosplay): like Urakakaka Bakugo Deku(well i guess he could just NOT use all for one)
Georgia (Something Sensible): o tru
Georgia (Something Sensible): its just skin taste
Halim (Greg): also
Halim (Greg): like anything
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~a nasty ass one apparently lmfao~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): deku texas smashes that booty into the mattress oof terrifying
Halim (Greg): just like how some vaginas smell/taste better
Halim (Greg): some dicks do too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need to go to bed but this convo is too funny and interesting xD
Halim (Greg): take it from somebody who's tried both <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Georgia (Something Sensible): as have i <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Georgia (Something Sensible): never again tho
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~has only experienced one and from one single person. RIP~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I have nothing more to contribute but i wanna finger guns <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Georgia (Something Sensible): tom ur valid
Halim (Greg): everyone can finger guns
Georgia (Something Sensible): there is NOTHING wrong with that rebecca
Marisa (Weeb): I’m scared
Halim (Greg): this is also true
Tom (tomukuncosplay): understandable marisa
Georgia (Something Sensible): marisa ill hold ur hand do not fear
Tom (tomukuncosplay): also me too rebecca your fine
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Glad I'm not the only one wooo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Tbh sex is meh too me. But then again I was with someone who wanted it and foreplay *all the time* so kinda hate it 🤷🏻‍♀️
Halim (Greg): anyways 
blowjobs are fun, and I stand by that condoms and lube ruin them (note i say this from the giving side, not the recieving)
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): tbh I've never felt comfortable with the idea of giving a blowjob because it literally makes me want to throw up so haven't even tried lol we found nice middle ground
Georgia (Something Sensible): compromise is nice
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sister Gabe is a 👏🏻 good 👏🏻 man
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think condoms and lube also ruin them, unless the person has dry mouth
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have heard HORROR STORIES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👀
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): all it takes is finding the right person that won't push you to do things you don't want to do
Georgia (Something Sensible): And lockjaw, that too
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): oof
Halim (Greg): Exactly Monica, thats the most important part
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): my jaw is already fucked up enough
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Someone told me once about someone we knew who didn't know how to give one/was there first so it was all teeth 😱
Halim (Greg): oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): 😬
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like RIP
Halim (Greg): its not fun
Georgia (Something Sensible): i mean i dont entirely blame them, you see peen, youre like "what the fuck do i do with this"
Georgia (Something Sensible): but teeth, ouch
Georgia (Something Sensible): i cringed and i dont even have a peen
Halim (Greg): i mean yeah 
also sometimes when small mouth and thick peen
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Same lol like Oof ouch
Halim (Greg): teeth are inevitable so you best just give up
Halim (Greg): yes live testimony
Rebecca (madameterralupus): "Small mouth, thick peen" coming to a theatre near you soon ... why  is that was came to my mind 😂
Halim (Greg): do you mean
Georgia (Something Sensible): new jackbox answer, definitely a winner
Halim (Greg): cumming to a theatre near you?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao yes. Way better
Halim (Greg): Anyways
Marisa (Weeb): This conversation has been brought to you by
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): tru
Georgia (Something Sensible): how could there be any other sponsor
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Soongebob promoting the message just makes it all the better
Halim (Greg): The take aways of tonight:
Icyhot condoms are a bad idea
Flavored condoms are a bad idea and just make blowjobs worse 
Glow in the dark condoms are fun as long as they fit and work
Please no teeth on peen 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY (courtesy of Monica)
"all it takes is finding the right person that won't push you to do things you don't want to do"
A beautiful and important message we all need to remember. Don't stay with people who push you to do things you don't want
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): soongebob 😂
Marisa (Weeb): Say all of that in the voice of sponge
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): too late Rebecca!!!

Tom (tomukuncosplay): cept i was pretty grumpy and had a headache oof
Marisa (Weeb): Oof maybe it was from the motion in the city
Georgia (Something Sensible): i couldve first met tom as anger!tom
Halim (Greg): ~~casual reminder that many of us have run into eachother at cons long before meeting again at later cons only to discover we had already met or were in the save vicinity long ago~~
Marisa (Weeb): At Otakon I ran into a Nepeta cosplayer on the steps and she was like “didn’t I see you two years ago at another event” I was like wHAT
Marisa (Weeb): I can’t even recognize myself how did you recognize me with a different wig and skin color

Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!288513265661902858> that happened to me with a Fem!Roman. We cosplayed Yu-Gi-Oh back in 2011 and totally didn’t know that it was us until later
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like she brought up an old photo and I was like “WAIT YOU WERE THAT MEI VALENTINE COSPLAYER I WAS THE SHITTY YAMI BAKURA”

Erik (Red Riot Thot): welp, there goes my afternoon productivity
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s for the good of me being able to say “on a scale of ___ to Bakugo’s mood, how bad is...”
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd say highest Good Mood is Deku? 🤔
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe All Might
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): all might is definitely bext mood
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): best

Jess (whoozica): on  a scale of bakugo to deku's mom, how much do you love deku?

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): True, I did say students.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm splitting it into three groups to make it easier: happy, neutral, and edgy characters. It's making it a lot easier lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bubble sort!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I got a degree to make things do that.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is what I came up with as a base. I open the floor for discussion.
