Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, so one thing that pisses me off about Amazon is when you're looking for something and it shows a price range like $3.99-$25.99 but literally nothing is $3.99
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ god yes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you open it and even though it says 3.99-24.99 somehow theyre all 45 dollars
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Price varies by size*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and then they're all on the higher price side
Jess (whoozica): YEA i hate that too
Anna (Cadmium): and its that one lucky bitch who fits in a size XXS who gets their stuff for $4
