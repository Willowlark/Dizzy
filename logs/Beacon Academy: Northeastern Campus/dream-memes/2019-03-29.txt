Jess (whoozica): my mom gets hype over every cosplay i do its pretty adorable
Jamie (Jamie): my mum doesnt hype but when she tells people about my costumes and sewing she honestly makes me want to hide cause she makes it sound so much better than i feel they are honestly
Jess (whoozica): like i didnt start cosplaying till i moved out cuz i thought they would think its weird but they dont at all and i wasted years of cosplay potential
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~mood~~
Jamie (Jamie): well i guess she does take photos every chance she gets when she sees me in costume lol

Anna (Blonde Banshee): but then like. fishents with noface
Jess (whoozica): leanna was your mom the one complaining on sunday at cce?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nah but she probably would have
Marisa (Mawisa): I like how ‚Äúfishnets with no face‚Äù implies that no face is an accessory and that the fishnets are the main costume
Anna (Blonde Banshee): is that not how cosplay works
Anna (Blonde Banshee): Erik can wear crocs too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i wore fishnets with ozma, so yea basically the fishnets were the entire cosplay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and ozma was just an add on
Anna (Blonde Banshee): WAIT HIGH HEEL CROCS
