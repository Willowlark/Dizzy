Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't agree with a lot of these...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but here's this
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Tyrian is more so a chaotic evil.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I agree
Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): Si
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And Roman isn't really lawful evil either
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Valid
Erik (Red Riot Thot): since he literally breaks laws
Rebecca (madameterralupus): YA
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and I wouldn't call Jacques neutral
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or Ozpin good
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And Tai is good. Not Neutral lol. I'd switch him and uhh Klein (?)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): All valid thoughts and agree lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): In what universe is Ironwood not lawful good? He's the foil to Qrow's Chaotic good
Mark (Mad Doctor): I don't like this game of Dream Daddy
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Yea ironwood is lawful good and Klein is neutral good. Oz is chaotic good
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: If we still consider him good
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oz might be true neutral or LN, trying to impassively move chess pieces towards a desired outcome
Mark (Mad Doctor): Roman is loaded with CN energy. As loyal henchman, I'd put Watts at LE. Jacques likes order but he does not seem to adhere to any set of principles. He goes in my NE bucket
Mark (Mad Doctor): Tai is like the paragon of goodness, the anti-Jacques. He's my pick for NG
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh yeah those are all wrong.
