Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): For anyone who wants to be disgustingly cute. ~~Facebook has no idea what to advertise me huh~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Why put your partner. That’s pretty dreading. 
Why not put your enemy so you can walk on their face.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also suggested was pets of family members.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You right tho.

Georgia (Something Sensible): It was very interesting

Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I fucking need that pan pin 😂😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): This is gonna sound dumb but is a Sapphic™️ different from a Lesbian™️
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause Sapphos was a poet from Lesbos so I would be inclined to say they’re synonymous
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I think its anyone who's attracted to girls
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But I could be wrong
Jess (whoozica): Dictionary says they are synomous
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Touché 💁
Anna (Cadmium): The alliteration is appealing tho
Mark (Mad Doctor): I believe Sapphic refers to a relationship that takes six years to develop in which one partner has feline characteristics and an abusive ex
Anna (Cadmium): Yikes
Mark (Mad Doctor): Oddly specific
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot):
