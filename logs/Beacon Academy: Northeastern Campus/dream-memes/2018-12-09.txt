meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I hate the internet, look what someone did
Jess (whoozica): Yooo wtf?! üò≠
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He sent it to me all proud like he though I would appreciate it???
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Da fuq
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh my god
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): And I‚Äôm just like PLS DONT POST THAT ANYWHERE
Jess (whoozica): This is just like a random follower of yours?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He‚Äôs someone I talk to kinda regularly so I‚Äôm pretty surprised and a little disgusted
Georgia (Something Sensible): is that photoshop or an ACTUAL posting what the fuck
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He said he made it in photoshop
Georgia (Something Sensible): ok well whew small bullet dodged that you dont have to jump through hoops to take it down
Jess (whoozica): UGH why are people like this üò≠
Georgia (Something Sensible): but yeah i would express to him that you really dont like it and say that you dont want it posted anywhere
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I asked him not to post it anywhere and I haven‚Äôt gotten a response back yet üòì
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wow, I'm really sorry someone did that to you. Is there a world where someone would be flattered by that gesture?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I DONT KNOW WHY HE THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE THIS???
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Like that pic is from a bts I did with Mel when we did our cinder/Pyrrha shoot at katsu but I don‚Äôt want ppl thinking I do porn
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea why anyone would think anyone would like that is beyond me. Like Im sorry what??
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Some people just don't think before they act... üôÑ
Matt (mattmyers25): Um that is weird as shit
Georgia (Something Sensible): too many people think that becase cosplayers cosplay that theyre more open to sharing their bodies/images of them than they really are
Jess (whoozica): Literally "thanks I hate it"
Georgia (Something Sensible): its... a problem
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's beyond fucked up
Georgia (Something Sensible): its really insulting, yeah
Georgia (Something Sensible): its forcing a label on meg that she clearly doesnt want
Georgia (Something Sensible): and most people, for that matter, wouldnt want
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Like yes I‚Äôve done lees shoots before, but those were clothed, with friends and nothing I wasn‚Äôt ok doing. But this kinda implies it‚Äôs taken to the next level and that I‚Äôm NOT comfortable with
Georgia (Something Sensible): not to mention, your cosplay isnt so far removed from your usual physical appearance
Georgia (Something Sensible): so its not very anonymous
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That kinda makes it worse tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): so someone else spreading that shit around on the internet really jeopardizes you, and shows very little respect for you
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Because it‚Äôs MORE recognizable
Georgia (Something Sensible): or, theyre just stupid
Georgia (Something Sensible): probably a combo of both
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Why do people suck üòë
Georgia (Something Sensible): glad you put your foot down tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): people need to learn that things like that arent ok
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He promised not to post it anywhere, hope he‚Äôs truthful üòì
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hopefully he keeps his word...
Jess (whoozica): Fuckin better
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I don‚Äôt fucking care you should never have made it to begin with
Georgia (Something Sensible): you said it makes your uncomfortable too?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yuppp
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh WHAT ryan knows that person
Georgia (Something Sensible): they were in his team SSSN shoot
Jess (whoozica): Umm???
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~also three hours is a bit much~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yeah, this is the first time he‚Äôs done something like this. Like he was one of the few ‚Äúfanboys‚Äù I genuinely liked
Georgia (Something Sensible): likeD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): PAST TENSE NOW
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Like WHAT REACTION DID YOU EXPECT FROM THIS
Georgia (Something Sensible): "haha thanks i love for it to be implied that i do porn thank you"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): RIGHT LIKE WTF
Jess (whoozica): "oh wow I love being falsley represented!"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): like there‚Äôs nothing wrong with female sex workers, I‚Äôm not dissing what they do but that isn‚Äôt something I want associated with me and it‚Äôs not something I want to ever do
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah like if you wanted to be shown doing sex work, then youd be doing sex work like
Georgia (Something Sensible): w h a t
Jess (whoozica): Exactly like wtf
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WOW WHAT A COMCEPT
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WHOD HAVE THUNK
Jess (whoozica): Ughh üòî I'm sorry that happened to you, that's bs, he'd better not post it anywhere
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh shit that was the Sage from the SSSN shoot?????
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah! thats why im surprised!
Georgia (Something Sensible): usually none of us shoot with wackadoodles
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I legit just woke up from a nap, checked insta and this is what I found. Makes me wanna go back to sleep
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What a cunt
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It‚Äôs so uncharacteristic of every other interaction I‚Äôve had with him so I was VERY shocked when o saw it
Jess (whoozica): And seriously... 3 hours?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WHY WOULD YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT
Georgia (Something Sensible): i think most people could do that in mspaint in 10 minutes
Jess (whoozica): Like?? Ok first why wouldn't you ask first? Esspcially if it was going to take you that long
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That should have taken like 20 minutes tops
Jess (whoozica): Yea seriously Il
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But it *should* have teken **zero** minutes
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): He messaged me this morning telling me he had an ‚Äúedit idea‚Äù he wanted to make for me and asked if i would be ok with him playing around in photoshop I was EXCITED and said yes. This is NOT what I expected to come from if
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because he didn't have done it to begin with
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats like a lie by omission
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Yupppp
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel like that paricular type of idea needed more clarity
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's why any time someone makes a request of me, I ask for details before I consent
Jess (whoozica): Yea you were prob expecting like some bad ass effects or something
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like "hey can you draw something for me?" ... "possibly? What is it you want?"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I know him so I figured it was either going to be for Pyrrha or zero two. I trusted him so I didn‚Äôt think I needed to ask for details
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Now I know
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Trust = ***destroyed***
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): SAY GOODBYE TO THAT
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Props to you for handling it so calmly. That must have been difficult to not tear him a new one
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Honestly I‚Äôm more disappointed then upset
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Great, now I sound like my mother üòÇ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The ol' "I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed in you" mom line
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): HOW DARE HE MAKE ME USE THAT
Jess (whoozica): Pro mom strats
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IM NOT READY FOR KIDS
Georgia (Something Sensible): i feel like you cant win
Georgia (Something Sensible): like either people assume youre like pyrrha so you wont curse
Georgia (Something Sensible): or they assume youre not like pyrrha so you wanna be in porn
Georgia (Something Sensible): there is no winning
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I‚Äôve given up  caring tbh ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I don‚Äôt plan on cosplaying her for a while because I‚Äôve got a lot of other stuff I want to do so I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôll help separate me from her in peoples minds
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): What the fuck
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): That's so disgusting
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Also 3 hours is bullshit you can do the same work with paint in 10 minutes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WOAH OKAH UM THATS NOT OKAY??? 
WHY WOULD THEY THINK THIS IS OKAY
I also think I know this person oof yikes
Mark (Mad Doctor): I hope you guys appreciate. This took me three hours
Evie (Katheryne Knight): A R T
