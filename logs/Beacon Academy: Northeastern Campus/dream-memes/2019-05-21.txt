Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): for a couple years I felt compelled to finish it but with the things people have been saying about how it ends I don't regret not finishing it lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): If youre not invested after a few seasons, it's not worth it to finish out of a sense of obligation. Was hoping for a season 6 RWBY, but got the Cliffs Notes version of it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna watch it and make my own judgement tbh
