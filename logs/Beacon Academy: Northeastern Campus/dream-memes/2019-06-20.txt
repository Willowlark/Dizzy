Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): I thought so!!
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Did you hear they're making an hbo series
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): That actually looks like it's going to follow the books closer
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm excited!!
Mark (Mad Doctor): I really do hope it's good, though tbh i felt like the books got a little bit worse with each volume. Pullman made his point really well early on, then just got increasingly polemical and ham-handed. I don't think I'm going to check out the newest book
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): To be fair I never finished the series for that reason
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): But the first couple were very good
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): And that movie butchered it completely
Mark (Mad Doctor): Agreed. I adore Lyra
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Saaaame
Mark (Mad Doctor): I seem to recall dressing as Lee Scoresby once for Halloween. Don't think I even knew the word "cospkay" back thhem
