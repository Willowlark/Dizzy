Marisa (Weeb): i have come to the conclusion that megumin would win in a rikka vs megumin battle but the dab would win in a t pose vs dab battle.
reasoning:

megumin's powers are real and rikka's are imaginary.

the T pose is good short-term defense against frontal threats but leaves the back open, has little maneuvering room for offense aside from pure intimidation (which is why it's best utilized by tall muscly people), and one's arms will get tired easily. the dab, on the other hand, can switch arms if one is getting tired, limits your frontal vision but gives you greater side and back vision, and allows you to jab someone with your elbow for an offensive blow.
