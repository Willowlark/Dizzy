Marisa (Weeb): I met Baked Go boy today. He‚Äôs so edgy that girls were sneaking selfies pointing and laughing at him.

Georgia (Something Sensible): Thanos' snap is indicative of his political leanings
Georgia (Something Sensible): THIS IS MY HYPOTHESIS hear me out
Georgia (Something Sensible): So his snap, if it killed a pregnant woman's baby, but not her, means he believes a fetus is a person
Erik (slendergiant): üçø
Georgia (Something Sensible): meaning he probably doesnt believe in abortion
Georgia (Something Sensible): but if a pregnant woman's fate is tied to her baby
Georgia (Something Sensible): then that means he believes the person isnt a person until theyve been birthed, that means he believes that a fetus doesnt have autonomy
Georgia (Something Sensible): meaning he would probably be pro-choice
Georgia (Something Sensible): we didnt see any pregnant women in infinity war so we will ACTUALLY probably never know
Georgia (Something Sensible): these are my thoughts, please and thank
Mark (Mad Doctor): This is why I always lived eating lunch with my science major friends
