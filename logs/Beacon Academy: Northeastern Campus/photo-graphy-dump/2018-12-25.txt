Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Congrats!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lol I had to look~~ but yes! And thank :3
I'm so excited to take nicer photos now 😭🙌🏻 I can't wait to experiment with it too.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 70-300 will be a change of pace for portrait work. That’s a telephoto zoom.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Was there another lens with the kit?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea it came with 3 other lenses. I can't recall exactly without looking ~~can look again tomorrow~~ but one was a telephoto lens and one was a wide angle lens
