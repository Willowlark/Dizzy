Mark (Mad Doctor): <@245270932602486784> <@184437198865563648> I almost forgot about a photo Georgia took of me at CH College with one of Bill's cameras. I had climbed a tree, and was planning on doing an "Elf on the SHELF/Schnee in a Tree" holiday meme with it. If the photo is still out there, I'd love a copy before the 25th. Thanks!
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah! It’s in the folder of pics I took and never got around to editing, I’ll play with the lighting and drop it in this chat!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Many thanks!
