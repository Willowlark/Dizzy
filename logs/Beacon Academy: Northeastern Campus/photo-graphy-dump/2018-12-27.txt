Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Recommendation: turn off automatic app updates in google play/ App store.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~time for Vero~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...excuse me WHat
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Actually wish I knew how to spark a movement to another plaform, cause facebook has made *so* many poor choices.
Jess (whoozica): LMAO WHAT
Jess (whoozica): instagram wtf
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Instagram: "We hear you like swiping left, so we made you swipe left for your content"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i hate this
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thanks, I hate it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like this is going to be another reason why people shift to Twitter
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Which is unfortunate because I hate Twitter
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ugh. I hate twitter's interface tho.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): THANK YOU
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And the character limit...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): twitter is horrible
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~no more caption writing tho~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): please no
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That and twitter lacks stories. I do love my ~~shit~~storyposting.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Same
Jess (whoozica): i dont care for twitter either
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~how can i do shitty story humor with NO STORIES~~
Jess (whoozica): how does insta manage to handle stories better then the actual app
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I get more story views than post likes, I mean, I need those~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): SAME
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 160 story views vs 100 post likes
Jess (whoozica): lol i dont even look at my story views, if i do i get stage fright
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 50~60 to 30~40.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Though I've been posting so infrequently recently, my posts get extra reach.
Marisa (Mawisa): my story views have gone up recently, i got 30 today~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ðŸ™Œ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Some people have been reporting that their Instagrams went back to normal after switching to the side swiping... maybe they've already gotten so much backlash they revoked the update xD
Jess (whoozica): i turned off autoupdae
Jess (whoozica): i dont want that shit XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): Itâ€™s a shame that social media is so not user friendly sometimes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like what the heck why canâ€™t they just give chronological posting
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ðŸ’°
Georgia (Something Sensible): But donâ€™t they lose money from people quitting using the app too?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Most people are sheep.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Occasionally they *really* fuck up, and turn more people away than not.
Jess (whoozica): WAKE UP SHEEPLE
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): but more often than not you don't lose enough to make a difference.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Check out @instagramâ€™s Tweet: https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1078335326991667205?s=09
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *"Due to a bug"*
Jess (whoozica): "this is someething we were gonna release, but then we got scared cuz you all hated it"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Is it a bug or a feature, we do not know
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "Do To A BuG"
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): "It's not a bug, it's a feature" takes on new meaning.
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Meet our new Vice President in Charge of Marketing, Steve Bug. He'll be leaving tomorrow."
