Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Uhngg I found out my coworker is a photog and I really wanna ask about doing photos together sometime but I'm nerviiiii D: ~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): What's the worst that could happen, they say no?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol valid. I guess I'm mostly like nervi cause they seem to just do fashion so unsure if that's all they shoot? Meanwhile I'm over here like eyy wanna shoot some crazy costumes ðŸ˜‚
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's a yes or no question.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Just do it. 'I like your photography, I do some cosplay and if you'd be willing I'd like to do some photos with you'.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Literally the only thing I had to counter with was if they don't shoot people, but you've already proven that wrong.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol next time I work with him (Idk when that is cause we like barely work together anymore ðŸ˜¦ ) I'll just wiggle over like eyy and try to ask. 
He does shoot people. It's most like nice pics you'd see in fashion magazines is all I can think of to describe it XD
