Erik (Red Riot Thot): Good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it's what it deserves
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I think it's an old post (don't think Adobe announced a price hike) but here's some stuff if you don't want to pay Adobe.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I've never heard of paint dot net as lightroom replacement tho`~
Marisa (Mawisa): omg so many people say it is but it isnâ€™t. I think they just equate free photo software = free editing software
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok yea i just looked at paint.net
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats 100% not equivalent to lightroom
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HOWEVER, the mobile app for lightroom is not bad at all
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and if you pay 5 dollars a month you get all the features from the PC version
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the app adobe photoshop fix is also really helpful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): my holy grail for quick photo editing. Free adobe apps (pay for more features, but not necessary) 

But for people who do it professionally, like bill, hunter, or rebecca (idk if anyone else is a photog in here, sorry if i missed you) paint dot net is 100% not going to cut it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like with the apps you can even do composites if you practice enough
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they are really pretty great for just being app versions of the full program
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thereâ€™s the @ photogs for atting everyone.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I use Lightroom CC (mobile) on my ipad. I've done entire galleries that way.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's a fantastic app, and syncs with the desktop version.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ oh rip i forgot we had that~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's a little weird using Lightroom classic and Lightroom creative cloud features together, but works for my purposes. I just ignore the cloud exists if I don't need that specific part. There's an adobe photographer bundle of lightroom and photoshop which is fairly cheap (I split the big boy subscription with my sister who does real arting).
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Lightroom mobile, quality, lightroom, still a bit clunky but quality. Biggest problem is the lightroom library system is proprietary, so if you switch from lightroom you lose all organization and edits. (Edits are recorded as the list of things you did, not changing the file itself. So lightroom reapplies them every time you view an image).
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I've yet to see a tool truly compete with lightroom. There was one that just released an expansion to try and expand the lightroom market, but it's not there yet.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea i agree
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Luminar 3.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): nothing really competes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh i tried that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): didnt like it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): my friend has it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I looked into it a bit, it didn't look good enough to attempt a jump.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its not as user friendly as lightroom is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and harder to achieve the right  Lookâ„¢
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I wouldn't call lightroom user friendly butttt~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): XP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean i think it is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but it might be just because im used to it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's a lot for someone new.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Learning the keyboard shortcuts is a god send.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): true
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm surprised I've never sent a string of ,....-=====--===,,-==-,..===---
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): before.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also I don't even use everything lightroom has. Tone curve confuses me, presets seem like too much work.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 90% of my photos only get basic panel adjustments.
Anna (Cadmium): honestly if anyone needs photoshop lmk i dont think they ever took away my student discount (unless its $35ish a month normally) and im the only one who uses it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You can only use creative cloud subscriptions on two computers at a time.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's bullcrap.
Anna (Cadmium): yeah i only have one computer
Anna (Cadmium): ~~is poor~~
Anna (Cadmium): my mom refuses to upgrade from cs4
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I just mean you canâ€™t share it to more than one person. Like me and sister split all our logins get cleared if a third computer logs in to the account.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Super annoying.
Anna (Cadmium): oh yeah its bs. honestly had they just made a harder to pirate software like.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.ebay.com/itm/Adobe-Photoshop-CS6-Extended/173735923953?hash=item287377d0f1:g:L0AAAOSwDEBcOTXq:rk:3:pf:1&frcectupt=true
Erik (Red Riot Thot): In case anyone's interested... because I kind of am
Anna (Cadmium): that seems sus
Anna (Cadmium): 0 reviews on that seller
Anna (Cadmium): sorry, zero ratings one review
Jess (whoozica): if u but CS6 it comes with one product ket for mac and one for windows so you could theoretically split it with a friend of a different operation system. thats what me and my brother did
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh shit they reviewed their own listnig xD
Anna (Cadmium): yeah also thats mad cheap like. too good to be true.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just want a hard copy of PS that I can use forever ðŸ™ƒ
Anna (Cadmium): i feel that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But fuck Adobe
Anna (Cadmium): careful though
Anna (Cadmium): my CS4 helped tank my old mac
Anna (Cadmium): the software is getting so relatively old that the newer systems  + chips dont like it 
or at least thats what im told
Anna (Cadmium): honestly idk why i pay for my cloud sub still i dont use it. i used to paint digitally
Jess (whoozica): https://www.ecrater.com/p/31842124/adobe-photoshop-cs6-extended-win?keywords=photoshop+cs6
Jess (whoozica): mahbe?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): my freshman year roommate let me install CS5 on my laptop and it was great but then that laptop got old and slow as shit so I got a new one and couldn't transfer the software over
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So now I use my old copy of Elements ðŸ˜›
Anna (Cadmium): o man wait i def have a pirated version of CS5 if you think you can copy it off my spare pc
Anna (Cadmium): i think
Anna (Cadmium): ~~it might just be pirated SAI~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but honestly, fuck subscription services
Jess (whoozica): for real thp
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *he says as his Solidworks subscription is about to renew in a month*
Anna (Cadmium): maybe dont buy that guitar then
Marisa (Mawisa): You can download CS2 from adobeâ€™s website for free
Jess (whoozica): i used cs2 foreverthe funny part is its not even that much different
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Paint tool Sai is nice for vectors! I did a few of those in college.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Jess (whoozica): "we highly encourage you to pay us" XD
Jess (whoozica): but yea there is  an inherent risk when using old software
Marisa (Mawisa): Whatâ€™s the risk? is it being called out
Jess (whoozica): it might just not wrok cuz the software is too old and unsupported
Marisa (Mawisa): yolo ðŸŽ‰ 
Iâ€™ve never had an issue with it yet
Anna (Cadmium): ~~cs3 tanked my mac and that was a 2012 laptop~~
Anna (Cadmium): just be careful
Marisa (Mawisa): What did it do?
Anna (Cadmium): it slowed it down incredibly, something to do with pathways was getting messed up, and i think that also when my drivers went weird. 
Also i lost my entire brush library for no reason.
Marisa (Mawisa): oo spooky
