Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need some opinions @everyone . Alot of you saw that print of Erik at New Years; 13x19. I have a bunch of that paper still, came with the printer I got on rebate and ngl, photos look AMAZING printed like that. Not every photo would work (IE anything cropped won't be quite big enough for that size print) but on a photo by photo basis of anything I return I could check if it'll print well. 

So since I have the materials and the photos look so good that way I was thinking about offering that for basically cost of production. Post my usual gallery, and by request of the person in question I can make a print of a return (assuming it meets size/ratio criteria). While I'm looking at the pricing (currently 6 bucks/two ko-fis would cover the ink and paper costs, no idea about mail costs yet were I to do that) what I really need to know is do people... want that? Like, a 13x19 print of themselves? I imagine you could do them as like, gifts? ~~I'm just not the type to put a 13x19 picture of myself on the wall and I need to make sure that's not the norm~~

TLDR: Would you pay money for a 13x19 print of a photo you've chosen I've done of you? 
ðŸ“¸ Yes
ðŸ’¸  No
