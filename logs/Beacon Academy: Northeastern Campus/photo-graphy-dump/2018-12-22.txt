ZombieHunter: makes sense
Georgia (Something Sensible): its an hour from my house
Georgia (Something Sensible): hunter you could come over friday to set up

Georgia (Something Sensible): no plans fleshed out yet, just spitballing still
Georgia (Something Sensible): i am more south of you when not going to skool lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Works for me. Just let me know what's happening at some point lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): ye i gotta tackle new years first, but SOMETHINGS happening the 12th
Georgia (Something Sensible): idk what yet
Georgia (Something Sensible): but it seems we will all be up to something
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Also depending, I may make one someone near me tag along if free and that's okay since it's a haul from my house to yours. I get a little iffy traveling too far alone still XD~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): lemme toss a poll in announcements
Marisa (Mawisa): I wanted to go to Kotori because itâ€™s 10 minutes from my house but Iâ€™m afraid of buying a ticket in case a plane is delayed
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Arenâ€™t the tickets cheap as heck?
Marisa (Mawisa): Theyâ€™ve been going up in price. Like $35 or so.
Marisa (Mawisa): Iâ€™ve been to every kotoricon except this yearâ€™s <:rip:378273525804433408>
Marisa (Mawisa): $35 is a lot of money to me
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah $36.89 per badge pre reg only
Which isnâ€™t bad for a con price with how expensive those are getting recently but thatâ€™s also almost 2 weeks of food budget and if a flight gets delayed then I canâ€™t attend the con owo
