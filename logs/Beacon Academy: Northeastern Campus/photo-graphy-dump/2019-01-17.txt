Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): New record for most expensive photog as goes to!
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hmmmm 3 Years and charging 200 is sketchy to me. However, I'm not in the photography business so I can't really say.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I don‚Äôt charge, but the average for these tends to be 75 for an hour, 8-10 prints.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I‚Äôve never seen anyone hit 300 before.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I know some wedding photographers charge a lot, or photographers that have been working for years charge that much, so that's why 200 for that same amount is sketch to me as a cosplayer.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~Though I was shopping for light equipment the other night and boy oh boy does that cost bank~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Cosplay photography is pretty cheap? I believe?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But I also have friends and other photographers I worked with who do that kind of work this person does for 10x less. Most cosplayers are 14-35yr olds who are working minimum wage-14 an hour and get payed bi-weekly. They're going to go with a cheaper option.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): But cosplay photogs also put limits on like ‚Äú5-10 photos edited‚Äù to offset the post time they‚Äôd need.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~according the comments he booked up~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): oh ?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Well good for him at least.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Ye. Still, lot of cash.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I couldn't afford that.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~I'm so happy I get payed the friday of Katsu~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Mood.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): It doesn‚Äôt even say how long his shoots are.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My one friend always has me set for 30 minutes, but we always run an hour XD
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Tis why I almost never do 30 minutes, I WANT to bullshit and hang out as part of a shoot while still getting photas.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): S A M E
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im way more chillax when it comes to shoots>
However if I'm working iwth a photographer that's booked up, I'm not gonna waste their time.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like if you have a shoot after a shoot, I'm gonna meet you early, and still have fun, but also be selfaware that you're booked up and have a scheduel.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I try to make sure I'm super respectful to photographers.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ‚ù§Ô∏è
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Yeah... I‚Äôve had it go where nothing gets done cause the shoot devolved into memes and chatting and I get annoyed because I want to shoot, but I couldn‚Äôt do all business either. I started this for the social aspect. #makingfriendsoutofcollegeishard
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's why I started cosplay XD
I love to dress up as my fav characters and meme
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If it weren't for cosplay I would n't be living with Chris or Jay right now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'd probably still be stuck in York.
Marisa (Mawisa): the problem is they're charging regular photography rates for cosplayers, who are used to heavily discounted rates because everyone is supposed to be doing it for fun. Outside of a con those would be normal prices for pictures. con photo prices have really been rising a lot tho
Jess (whoozica): Yea those are like wedding rates. But with a wedding you get like hundreds of pics back and you're the only two people they are worried about being happy all day
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And wedding photos don't *have* to make you look like a movie poster
Jess (whoozica): Yea üòÇ that too.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): True that.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Mine sure don't. A breeze blew up during the first photos, and in her effort to keep her veil from blowing away, the newly minted Mrs Mad Doctor stabbed me in the eye with her thumb. I look swollen and pained in all subsequent photos. No photographer skill is gonna remove that
Jess (whoozica): Oh no! üò≠
Mark (Mad Doctor): Still, for $300, I expect Ryan Reynolds to be waiting in the wings to serve as my body double
Jess (whoozica): he doesnt even state how long the shoots are?
Marisa (Mawisa): for 3 pictures i'd assume like 15 minutes <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Jess (whoozica): yea i mean good for him? and like cool for all those people that can spend that much but whooooo not me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah uuuuh I got rent and bills
Mark (Mad Doctor): One shoot pays for a night at the Gaylord. Good work if you can get it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): three shoots and Katsu pays for itself
Jess (whoozica): yea ssly and you still have pretty much the whole weekend
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): He may burn alot of time on post production tho.
Jess (whoozica): oh im sure he does
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): https://petapixel.com/2019/01/17/this-dog-is-a-talented-skateboarding-cameraman/ <@!334090409389195266> the go proing dog.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): A GOOD BOY
