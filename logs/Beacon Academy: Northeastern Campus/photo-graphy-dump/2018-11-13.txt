Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hmm.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So I just saw an article about a guy evaluating use the new Ipad pro as a primary workstation for photography.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I... can't really imagine using a tablet OS for that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lightroom mobile (and I'd guess photoshop) is pretty feature filled, they have the apple pencil so you can draw on the image, and there are some apps that can copy images from and tether cameras...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I dunno, I don't feel like it *work*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thoughts?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'd rather have a bigger screen to work from
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): well.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): the new ipad is 12.9 inches.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Which, at least as far as I'm concerned, is *gigantic* for a tablet. How do you even hold that.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (my laptop is 13")
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Jeez
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can
Erik (Red Riot Thot): At that point it's just a laptop without a keyboard... that you can probably hook a keyboard up to via bluetooth...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can't really complain about the size when it's basically what I got.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You can.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): but tablet OS.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and no external hard drive access.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So it's cloud storage or on device.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://petapixel.com/2018/11/13/i-bought-the-new-ipad-pro-so-you-dont-have-to/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```And for a similar price point, you are already into 13” Macbook territory.```
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```technically you get more storage with the iPad, and that new processor supposedly is nothing to laugh at. But what you lose is RAM, and a FULL operating system```
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That would be the article I read.
