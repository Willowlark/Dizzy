Marisa (Weeb): OH NO

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have a flickr but like never use it. I dont think I can even get into it anymore XD
I just upload all my stuff to my FB and then save it on my computer too
Marisa (Weeb): I have a lot of emails Iâ€™ll just make more Flickr accounts <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): idea: we break into a starbucks in the wee hours of the night
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Why break in
Marisa (Weeb): it's more thrilling
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^
Marisa (Weeb): we use light stands and flashes because we can't turn the store lights on, so that when the cops show up they turn the lights on and shout "FREEZE!" and we scatter like cockroaches
my sister's run from the cops with broken legs before we can ask her to give us pointers
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Dont worry I know how to turn on the lights if we sneak in
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Im an employee so if the cops come i can be like "no we supposed to be here for reallsies
Marisa (Weeb): [starbucks voice] "good evening officers"
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): "Welcome to Starbucks how may I help you"
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cops: "Your under a rest for trespassing"
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): "You want a ristretto espresso? What size"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): That mans in Treble
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://gizmodo.com/flickr-is-going-to-delete-a-bunch-of-photos-back-up-you-1830177165 So like. Fake news?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Really goes to show why you should never trust an individual source and always cross check articles.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): (Flickr is stopping uploading of photos if you are on the free tier with 1,000+ photos, not deleting your photos)
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah when I was reading about it yesterday I tried looking for articles directly from Flickr
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): didn't see there's a 30% pro accounts for the month.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~cause tbh it's too much work to switch from Flickr soooo~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://petapixel.com/2018/11/02/why-flickr-limiting-free-users-to-1000-photos-is-a-smart-move/ Interesting take on it.
