ZombieHunter: <@!334090409389195266> call the store and say something
ZombieHunter: Like. Tell them photo desk is unprofessional
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://photofocus.com/2018/11/01/flickr-to-end-1-tb-of-free-storage-limit-free-accounts-to-1000-photos/
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~my site's images are pulled via flickr hosting~~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: wtf
Erik (Red Riot Thot): rude
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Merry christmas, I have to deal with that before the new year.
Jess (whoozica): What the fuuuuccck
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have no idea how I'm going to though, cause the plugin I use is *just* for flickr galleries and hosting images myself will be complicated, alot of work to update my 150+ galleries, and probably expensive.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That's a massive reduction... like holy shit
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 20,000 50mb files to 1,000.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): who the fuck thought that was a good idea?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The people who bought out flickr? After Verizon bought them out?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Flickr's been sort of dead in the water for a long time.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 1TB is *ridiculously* generous in the current market for cloud storage.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They're putting more perks for pro member ships, so they're trying to get people to switch.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have 6k photos on Flickr as is.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Correction, I only have *124* galleries.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/01/changing-flickr-free-accounts-1000-photos/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```we spoke to all knew about how many photos they had shot in the past few days, but few knew how much storage those photos consume without doing tricky math.```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): absolute bullshit.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I get that maybe not every photo is the same size, but like, figuring out maybe an average size and multiplying it by number of photos is not *tricky math*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Or like, when you plug your card in, it literally tells you how much space you've used
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Anyway, you fall in the minority of free users who have more than 1000 photos on their accounts
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, so alot of people export for web resolution. Which means they don't need to be wider than 1,000 pixels, as that fits comfortably on the screen.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I do.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My photos are consistently around 600kb.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I use about 4gb.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I *just* figured that out.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Triiiiccckkkyyyy, oooo that was hard.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): apparently I created an account in 2012 and never used it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeaaaah I had some older account when I was first acclimating.
