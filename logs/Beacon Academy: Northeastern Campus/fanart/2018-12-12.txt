Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!334090409389195266> you mentioned you first cosplayed a Chobits? A friend of mine gave me some vintage clamp art books, this one is all Chi. Dunno if youâ€™d want to see it sometime.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ˜® YES
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Very pretty art.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i love chobits art
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Wasnâ€™t it a bishoujo series...? I never saw it, but I know sheâ€™s a robot and the main dudes... property? Not knocking it, Iâ€™m just unsure what the whole story is about.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if im 100% honest i dont remember
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was like... one of my first animes ever
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Itâ€™s heckin old. Classic clamp.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™m guessing there was more to it than pretty girl who wants to serve you though, cause I doubt thatâ€™s of interest to a woman and Clamp is way better than that.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats how it started you were supposed to believe that shes just a robot that was made to serve her master
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but she has a mind of her own
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and memories
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she acts like a child, and her owner notices right away and kinda backs off and treats her as though shes a child, teaches her how to be a human
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lot of weird , uncomfy gimmicky stuff
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like she didnt know underwear was a thing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and didnt know not to just undress in front of people
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but its all like VERY innocent, so not like fan servicey, at least from what i remember
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but then theres like a huge over arching plot with her having a sister and her memories slowly coming back and stuff
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Hmm. Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve been curious about before over the years, but never went into.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But, the art book is downright beautiful so.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it was one of the only animes i ever actually watched all the way to the end
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so it was super interesting
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i usually fall off after like the first 5 episodes, anime never captivates me
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *well itâ€™s a mistake so*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): fuck dude, you're right
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Take it from me, an expert.
