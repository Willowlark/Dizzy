Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://www.facebook.com/groups/RWBYRepublicIsTheGreatest/permalink/2755062257897336?sfns=mo I appreciate uraraka being black widow rather than Peggy, Uraraka is supposed to be a hero like deku Bakugo etc. ~~still gets no screen time but sheâ€™s not a one movie love interest~~

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Most of them are well assigned.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thor!iida a stretch tho.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah that was like the only one that I don't get

Jess (whoozica): Bucky todoroki ðŸ™Œ
Mark (Mad Doctor): Kirishima was my favorite casting
Anna (loud and likely blonde): am cry at hawkeye shinsou. 
Thor iida is def a stretch but monoma fits. a little too well as loki. Idk who i would have made thor instead though
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm with Erik, Kaminari.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Monoma good Loki.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u know to be fair. thor was an idiot in the first movie
Anna (loud and likely blonde): otherwise the only one i can think of is Mirio.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh shit yeah that'd be a good one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): also fits because ||Thor lost his poper at one point||
Anna (loud and likely blonde): o shit yea i didnt even think of that
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~oh god wait im dying that shinsou is hawkeye bc hawkeye gets mind controlled and now its backwards~~
