you want fucking rwby chibi?: i want to read that but i heard in the beginning its hard to follow
Jess (whoozica): oooo nicuuu
Jess (whoozica): yea ill agree with that
Erik (slendergiant): I will also agree to that
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): http://kumafromtaiwan.tumblr.com/post/175479533071/more-pages-under-the-cut-more-chapter-45 this is the right link, whoops.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): also yes, *incredibly* hard to follow.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): great art.
Erik (slendergiant): especially if you don't realize there are more panels under the photo area...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I've done that.
Erik (slendergiant): for the longest time I was only reading the first 10 or so panels (because I think that's Tumblr's upload limit) and didn't realize there were more in the text portion of the post. I was like "Oh, I guess they're here now and so-and-so did this thing..."
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah. I've reread multiple times because of that.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Doesn't make MUCH more sense after you read everything, but it helps.
Erik (slendergiant): ugh I think I have to reread it anyway because I don't even remember what was happening anymore
Jess (whoozica): shit got cray thats all i know
