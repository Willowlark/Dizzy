Marisa (Mawisa): the new manga art style looks really familiar but i can't find any of the artist's past works. but it really reminds me of something. idk what.
Marisa (Mawisa): why so familiar hhhhhh
Marisa (Mawisa): search results show this may be their first published manga? ðŸ¤” but to make it in shounen jump on your first publication is pretty big...

Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Wasn't the manga originally a fan art that RT found and was like yes we like dis be our manga boi
Marisa (Mawisa): maybe?
the anthology definitely was because anthologies are entirely fan-made but published officially
the first manga was drawn by a professional though who had several published works and was a known name in the industry. the pictures i posted just now are from a new serialization that just began last month but I *searched* and found practically nothing about the author. maybe if I buy the magazine there'll be a little blurb about them but it's questionable.
Marisa (Mawisa): even japanese fans are like "woah who dis"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay but P y r r h a
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She looks gorgeous
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Sheâ€™s a literal ray of sunshine I love her
