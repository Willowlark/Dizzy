Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Jaun is a thug man.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): nicu.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I like how it's still comparatively simple while not looking like a self insert character.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): why is 3.0 Jaune so *hawt* though.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Also his sleeves have armor and I'm about that.
Dishwasher1910: since everyone is asking, the thing on the back is the carrying case for the sword, which also transforms into the a Roman-like shield, or a great sword ( with a little slit at the top for the blade to go in to initiate the transformation.) Think God eater https://t.co/zniWG3a52j
