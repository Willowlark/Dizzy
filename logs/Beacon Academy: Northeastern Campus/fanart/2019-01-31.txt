Mark (Mad Doctor): Was planning in wearing Jacques to Otakon this year. Fully prepared to be slapee this time
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I sure hope not. You aren't Jacques.
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's very kind of you!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Of course! Just cause we cosplay certain characters doesn't make us THE character.

I sure as hell am not Winter IRL. I'm a smol bean that would rather be left alone and cant take charge.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah. I just remember being the slapper more than the slappee at Zenkai. Next season will be payback time. And I will cheer when Weiss leaves Jacques and Shitley as crying wrecks, and of course be a memeworthy good sport when people want photos of it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm down for meme photos again
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Vernal: *Can I call you Mommy*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~bold of you to assume she doesnt already~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~raven would want to be called daddy tbh~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~You right~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~where do you think yang got "call me sir" from~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Raven would have had to been home for Yang to pick it up from her~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~hereditary daddy kink?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And a Yang to round off that set
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀 i have everything for that cosplay except the gun
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~Let's do ittt. I kinda wanna do the Blake design lol~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I think I have a nerf gun that looks similar~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~yea i was gonna say i could just paint a nerf gun xD~~
Matt (mattmyers25): Yang's gun is a AA12 shotgun
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~so not a nerf gun
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol okay so let's go get exactly that XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Go real or go homeee? XD
Matt (mattmyers25): Nope. Fully automatic shotgun
Anna (loud and likely blonde): do those bullets even go in that gun
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i can def make that gun out of foam tho
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Technically two different guns, but.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It'd work for it though lol
Matt (mattmyers25): True lol

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Aw shit I already know I'm going to buy that and find it lackluster.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm excited
Jamie (Jamie): So it would def be fun to do a tactical group cosplay and i would be able to have so much fun making the prop items i would probs do ruby cause I love my red heads
Jamie (Jamie): I hope they release tactical jnpr next 👀
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The best part of RWBY fanartists is they always seem to draw LOTS of RWBY, not just one character. ❤
