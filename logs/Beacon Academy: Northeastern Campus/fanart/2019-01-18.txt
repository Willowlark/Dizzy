Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Anna (Cadmium): I love dishwasher posts like. Heart wrenching stuff. And then. Mojojoj just. Sharks
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *SHARKS YOU SAY?*
Anna (Cadmium): ~~when are you gonna make yourself some shark teeth for kiri Erik~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~probably never because it's a pain in the ass~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Don't you just use the tooth paint to get the effect?~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I nixed that because it was even more of a pain
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof really?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was gonna ask how well it worked after you tried it out for a bit cause I need sharp teeth for Soul. Guess not that well XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You have to keep your teeth dry the entire time you're applying it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Big oof. That's annoying...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And like, even the moisture from breathing affects it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes. Hard pass on that lol

Erik (Red Riot Thot): nah that's ok
Erik (Red Riot Thot): thanks tho
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): photoshop exists too if youre super inclimed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but its really not that big of a detail
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like if it were the only thing that distinguished him from other characters then i could see the need for them, but hes clearly identifiable without... plus its REALLY annoying to wear even just for photos ~~hence why i didnt wear mine for mavis~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i just enjoy suffering which is how im gonna make like. anglerfish teeth for grimm yang
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats gonna be sick though
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): try not to drool xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ye I'd definitely go the photoshop route
Anna (Cadmium): imma make them like. hopefully hook into the spot above my canines or maybe i can find a mouthguard to stick em to. 
Hopefully no drool bc i had braces for like 4 years and wore a mouthguard for 6 for sports
Jess (whoozica): i think you can but moutgaurds at the store but i heard thry are bulky
Jess (whoozica): i have fangs that came with like molding past so the fit exactly over my canines, the stay in and they arnt annoying at all
Anna (Cadmium): eh i mean im used to them. maybe i can use my broken retainer to stick em to
Jess (whoozica): ooo there you go!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Assuming it was shared already but her you go anyways
