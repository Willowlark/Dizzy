Evie (Katheryne Knight): I WANNA DO THAT SO BADLY
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I think Pyrrha looks good, but palette swap Jaune is too dark.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Jess likes redhead Jaune apparently tho.
Jess (whoozica): ~~pallet swap jaune is sexy~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I do too
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I like redhead Jaune
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Copper colored chest plate tho? It looks like, rusted.
Jess (whoozica): nah bra rust is redder
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): still rusty.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Redhead Jaune tho
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Erik (slendergiant): I love pallete swap Jaune. I love the burgundy pants and bronze armor. Very Gryffindor-y
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I am clearly outnumbered by redhead lovers.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): ~~i don't really like either oops~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i love redheads, but i don't like this jaune color scheme, i think his pants shouldve been brown and hoodie red...maybe a lighter gold too for the armor??~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ye, like, nothing personal to redheads, just weird color choices here.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Hair isn't the problem.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I can get behind Leannaâ€™s point.
