Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 2B + Nora + Sole Survivor.
Jess (whoozica): yea i was thinking that looks like 2bs top
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and thigh slit.
Jess (whoozica): no really getting any fallout vibes tho
Jess (whoozica): maybe in the hammer
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hair style feels kinda fallout.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im getting full destiny vibes
Jess (whoozica): yea i was thinking more destiny with the outfit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): as in Jess's Destiny? :owo:
Jess (whoozica): but that top is 2b-y
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 2b x destiny
Matt (mattmyers25): He did a nora in halo looking armor
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah same, 2b and destiny
Tom (tomukuncosplay): NICU
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Someone commented it's got some of Ren to it, which I thought the same.
Jess (whoozica): yea like the mar bands and the skirt style and the lotus-y motiff
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yee that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 💔
Jess (whoozica): y heart brek tho?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Welp. Guess he isn't doing Pyrrha.
Erik (slendergiant): She ded
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): RIP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): she still dead LMaO
Matt (mattmyers25): Maybe jaune will have elements of pyrrha on him
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, I knew she was dead in his canon, but he could still do the design.
Matt (mattmyers25): Also, I hope he does strq
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): give summer a design please
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shes dead too though so probs not
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): :c
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Summers fine wym
Jess (whoozica): wait nora dead in his canon?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pyrrha.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): not Nora.
Jess (whoozica): oooo ok
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Maybe if enough people complain at him to do the design...*
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): does he do commission work? Might be able to commission him rather than complain about him
Matt (mattmyers25): He has a patreon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Patreon isn't commission.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): commission into his own canon though? i
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): No lol
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Just the design
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm on it, though most of the stuff he posts ends up in public space so...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WOw
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): I MEAN HE ISNT WRONG
Matt (mattmyers25): If you join he patreon, you can help decide what he does next
Matt (mattmyers25): And shots fired
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): His commissions would likely be hella pricy if he does them
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Worth it tho
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): And usually artists ask if they can post it publically before doing so
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea i also feel like he probably would take a commsion for a 3.0 design if he wasnt planning on doing it for that character
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He doesn't post to patreon exclusively very often.
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Yeah!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it'd probably have to be something unrelated to 3.0 for him to do a commission
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BUT i feel like hes going to do pyrrha at some point anyway
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Getting Georgia on the 3.0 JNPR boat is one of my trump cards for Renora 3.0, work with me Bach~~
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Yeah it’s just kinda weird people are yelling at him what to do
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mm. I wouldn't want him to force a design either tho. If he doesn't have the vision for it, so be it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Exactly
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You might be right too Leanna, while he's a *very* big fan of people using the 3.0 lore he's come up with, changing that lore might be too much for him.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Commission or not.
Jess (whoozica): commission someone to make the cosplay for me and ill wear it 😏
Jess (whoozica): you severly over estimate my skills if you think i could make that
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Doesn’t hurt to ask him, but it’s important to respect HIS art and what he doesn’t or does want to do
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You *under* estimate your skills tho.
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): catch me using the female ironwood art he did
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~someone else replied to this and now I'm getting a bunch of @'s I don't care about I hate twitter~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m gonna become a patron of his and beg for a 3.0 Winter I will sacrifice my soul for this.
Erik (slendergiant): Go big and beg for 3.0 Snowbirds
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Can’t hurt to try
