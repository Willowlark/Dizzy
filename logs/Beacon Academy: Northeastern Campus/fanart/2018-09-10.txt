Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wish I had a way to filter retweets...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I could probably write code for Dizzy to do this rather than a webhook *buuttttt* who has the time.
Erik (slendergiant): could you link the bot to his Tumblr instead? It's the same content as Twitter minus the other random posts
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Does tumblr have webhooks? It has RSS, but that'd require building on Dizzy.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also I think he posts more to twitter, right? iirc twitter is the one he consistently uses.
Erik (slendergiant): It doesn't have the WIPs but I think it has all the same final version
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://twitter.com/Dishwasher1910/status/1039177622461140992 IT'S YOUR BOI
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also may have found a filter in twitter advanced search.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If we stop getting posts, I broke it.
Jess (whoozica): WHOA
Jess (whoozica): NOW THATS SOME GOOD SHIT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Erik's boudoir shoot is when?~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): WOOO NICE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh fucking rip.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): How much you want to bet the cross she has is the one Qrow wears? And the way Qrow wears it is supposed to be traditionally for mourning a loss.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bach is a sick boi.
Jess (whoozica): qrows is crooked though
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): riiiight, I'm saying he took hers and made it crooked, because that's a way of mourning a death apparently.
Jess (whoozica): OOOO ok
Erik (slendergiant): except he's already wearing it in the team photo
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): aaaah, kk.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Bach is technically in fanon, even if he's going to ascend at somepoint~~

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I didn't just add my own account to the search to test it still works~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Having spent years studying Scandinavia in the Middle Ages, I was always a little skeptical of the "tilted cross=mourning" interpretation, since the symbol is as rare as crows teeth in medieval art. So I looked it up in a dictionary of Christian symbols. It does indeed represent sadness *because it represents the cross Jesus carried on his way to his own execution.* Looks like the death flags are flying once again over Drunkle Qrow
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Does that mean Qrow is walking towards his own death?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~volume 6, 13 episodes of everyone talking on Qrow's death bed as his liver cancer kills him~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): "It was...worth it."
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Only fight scene: Ruby v Male Nurse enforcing visiting hours.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Male nurse played by Pilot Boi™️
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > ~~Pilot~~ Nurse boi sees Weiss
> "You! I left my old job for you!"
> Weiss: "... whoever you are, get this girl's uncle a better room."
> "I'm not breaking any more rules for you kid, I lost my ship after that."
> Weiss: "Why are you still here?"
> "..."
> *Pilot boi goes to scam a bigger room for Qrow*
