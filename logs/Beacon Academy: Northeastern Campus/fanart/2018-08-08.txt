Mark (Mad Doctor): Is her name Persephone in canon? Because that adds a whole new layer of symbolism
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Nah
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): _wants summer rose designs but she doesn’t even have a canon one yet_
Erik (slendergiant): She's based on Pinocchio
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): how do I sell my soul for summer screentime
Mark (Mad Doctor): I know she's Pinocchio, but Persephone was the one who split the year between the land of the living and Hades.  Could Dishwasher be telling us something? (Note Pinocchio also had a few "rebirth" episodes in his story, being expelled from Monstro the whale and become a real boy)
Erik (slendergiant): I mean, Ozpin is a wizard with the ability to change humans into birds... robot into human should be a piece of cake
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): pls
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont think she'll ever become human, but she'll definitely be "reborn" in a rebuilt robot kind of way
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): even the 3.0 art she has exposed robot arms o3o which is super cool
Mark (Mad Doctor): The wings remind me of Mercy's from OW
