Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh same

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Late to convo but yea can we please get black colored merch for blake?? I want to wear my girls merch but I hateeee light colored clothing so much...
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): This isn’t a real rwby shirt is it? Because it’s wrong
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): The last character should be like | not ー
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol it is. I don't have that one but I have the Blake one
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): How can Rooster Teeth be selling merchandise that’s wrong, that’s so cringey <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> 
All they had to do was get one proof reader 
I bet the ruby one is wrong too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): RIP
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): IT IS ITS DOUBLE WRONG IT HAS TWO MISTAKES
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What are they even to say? Their names...?
Matt (mattmyers25): How it is wrong?
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Yeah it’s their names
Erik knows what he’s talking about
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): 
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): The lines should be | not ー
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh. Is Blake's wrong too?
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): No Blake and Yang are the only two that are spelled right because they don’t have a ー in their name. It’s used to make syllables longer like Ruby rose  is ルビーローズ and Schnee is シュニー。
When written horizontally it’s fine, but when written vertically it looks like the number one so the line is supposed to follow the text and be vertical
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): So it should be
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): ル
ビ

ロ

ズ
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): シ
ュ

Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's like the opposite of the English t-shirts in Asia

Mark (Mad Doctor): We once had a Japanese exchange student stay with us. His underwear had "Puffy Boy" printed on it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg 😱
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): oh puffy was a great band!!
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): puffy was even popular here, was he here when puffy had their own cartoon show?
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): like mid-early 2000s i think
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is that what it's for?? Puffy ami yumi? XD
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): maybe!!!! puffy ami yumi was just called Puffy in japan, they had to add their names in the US because there was already a band here named puffy i think
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Interesting 😮
