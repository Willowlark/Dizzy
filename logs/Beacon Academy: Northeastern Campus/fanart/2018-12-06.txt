Erik (Red Riot Thot): FUCKING OUCH
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): By 2020 he'll have 'subconsciously' animated an episode.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Since he does concept art for RT, maybe his stuff will become canon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~I hope not though because it's all too sad~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): His writing isn't amazing, but his ideas, woo.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I need.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They better be rwby crossovers.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I can't tell if he means doing waifus from games exclusive to each console, or if he plans on making each console into a waifu...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```*The series takes place in a world known as Gamindustri. It is a world ruled by four goddesses that are the personifications of game consoles*```
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ah, gotcha
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~Xbox-chan better be hot~~

Erik (Red Riot Thot): NOW THAT'S XBOX CHAN
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): something == reaction
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IT GOR BETTER
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Basically the girls are goddesses of their nation, and they get a 'cpu' form which is powered by the number of fans of their console.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): LOOK AT HER
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So each of Nintendo, Xbox, and Sony have a girl, with Sega (the games creators) creating their own nation.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Vert (Xbox) is dignified publicly, a fan of very long game sessions (like, days), and obsessed with her lack of a little sister.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): (Because xbox has no mobile console)
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Haha. Neptune is a troll.

Jamie (Jamie): *still want to cosplay*
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The entire series is tongue in cheek, they make fun of gaming, pop culture, everything.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's... admittedly not the most deep series (there are no men), but the comedy is fun for awhile.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): IM LOOKING THIS IP THR SECONC I GET HOME
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I haven't played the original JRPGs, but they have DOZENS of spin offs which I've played a few of, and they had an anime.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh no, this has a dozen games.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ah yes. Xbox has the most processing power, which is why her bobbies are huge. The classic os tan rule is memory/processing power == cup size.
Jamie (Jamie): 
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~which is why Wii (Blanc) is flat chested~~
Jamie (Jamie): Found my ps4 i need to play the games

Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was interested in watching the anime but it was put out by Funimation... which is no longer available on VRV... ~~guess I have to start a free trial for Funimation now~~
