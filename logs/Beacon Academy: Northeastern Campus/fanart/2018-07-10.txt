Evie (Katheryne Knight): Jess is right I’ve seen it happen multiple times so be careful.
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): another thing just happened where a company bought art from an artist to use in a comic, and the contract apparently gave them ALL rights to the art so they sold the design to hot topic and it got made into a shirt, and now the artist is getting NO money
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): people LOVE screwing over artists so be careful
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh yeah that sounds sketch as hell.
