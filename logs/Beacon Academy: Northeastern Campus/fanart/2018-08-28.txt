Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm betting Winter tbh.
Erik (slendergiant): whoops sorry for caps
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The face shape looks older.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If it’s Winter I’ll scream that means they have matching scars now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also if it’s winter FULL BODY PLZ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~so I can cosplay it~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He's only doing continued designs for cosplayers, Mangoloo inspired him.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~which is why he should do Pyrrha for fucks sake~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^^
Erik (slendergiant): *-checks comments to see if there's any discussion yet-*
Erik (slendergiant): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Evie (Katheryne Knight): okay look

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Lkke
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): heeee will.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Guess I’m dropping something for Katsu because you bet your butt I’m gonna die making 3.0 Winter
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also like I wanna know how she fits into the 3.0 stor
Matt (mattmyers25): If it is winter, does this mean we will get all of strq drawn?

Evie (Katheryne Knight): IM HYPERVENTALAGING
Matt (mattmyers25): <@229713389511901185> start planning
Evie (Katheryne Knight): F UUUU
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Just sayin if he does Qrow I’ll have to invest in a male dressform XD
Matt (mattmyers25): I am already planning to do qrow if he does do him.
You know you want to cosplay 3.0 winter
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I probably will do 3.0 Winter if Dishwasher does it
It's just it means I'll have to hold off on revamping Pyrrha for Zenkaikon or Colossalcon
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OG Colossal?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep. ^_^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~east is better~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I already have a room for the OG though
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My friend got two, and put her one friend in charge of the room, so me and Chris are staying with them.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I plan on possibly doing CCE if I'm able to get a room. Unless I magically can go to RTX
