Rebecca (madameterralupus): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Having read spider Gwen... she is decidedly not enough of a mess in this picture*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 100%
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~is this armpit fetish?~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What makes you say that?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): only armpits visible
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Knowing sakimi, if she did more than the portrait it’d be a swimsuit cut suit or something.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): “Older spin on spider Gwen”
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *swimsuit with a hood?*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Aesthetic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~we all know arm socks are attractive. We’re rensexual~~
Jess (whoozica): dont you know shoulders are a sexual organ?
Jess (whoozica): thats why we couldn't wear spaghetti straps in highschool
Anna (Cadmium): ~~why are the boobs divided like that thats not how spandex works~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Sakimi doesn't know the titty work, have you seen some of that art~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~no~~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~show me the terrible art~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *speaking of shoulders...*

Anna (Cadmium): Oh THEYRE the one who did the 'adult RWBY' where none of the clothes or anatomy is remotely physically possible
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the art is stunning in terms of color and shading, but physically none of them make sense
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they draw like a male comic artist
Anna (Cadmium): thats not how legs work
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but with better coloring
Anna (Cadmium): they draw like whats his face rob litchfield??
Anna (Cadmium): liefeld
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They're straight up pin ups, no if ands or buts.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~the RWBY ones are pretty nice except for Weiss, Weiss just looks weird~~
Anna (Cadmium): look at ruby's legs
Mark (Mad Doctor): There's so much I like about their art--color and lighting--but their knowledge of anatomy seems largely theoretical
Anna (Cadmium): https://www.deviantart.com/sakimichan/art/Adult-RWBY-series-Ruby-Rose-pinup-760832617
Anna (Cadmium): thats not how legs work
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they pointy
Anna (Cadmium): thats not how legs work at all
Anna (Cadmium): her legs are 2/3 of her body
Erik (Red Riot Thot): her thigh alone is as long as her torso and head
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~"she's got legs, she knows how to use em"~~
Anna (Cadmium): her above knee legs arent even the same size
Mark (Mad Doctor): When your weapon is a giant scythe, every day is Leg Day
Anna (Cadmium): rlly its core day
Anna (Cadmium): ~~pole vault taught me that~~
Anna (Cadmium): one leg is in perspective one is perpendicular to the viewing angle they should be different lengths but they arent
Erik (Red Riot Thot): most people are too focused on the ~~tiddies~~ detailed shading to notice or care
Anna (Cadmium): its like a monet. far away at a glance its great. up close its a mess
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The comments are gold though
Jess (whoozica): OH GOD
Anna (Cadmium): Sometimes I wish I was Jared, 16, who never learned how to read
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *19
Anna (Cadmium): valid
