Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Tom (tomukuncosplay): **I burn plays in the background**
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Holy shit, I have a mighty need to cosplay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Short hair yang is so good....
Erik (slendergiant): And would be hella more manageable

Rebecca (madameterralupus): ğŸ˜‚ I just saw and was about to share as well lol!
These are super cool and I'd totes do a crossover of this  ğŸ˜®
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): http://the-awkward-jnpr-roomies.tumblr.com/post/98217211501/ren-gets-me-every-time
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Reasons I am lame: My first thought was 'this floor plan has no restroom for guests, how strange'.
Jess (whoozica): ~~get these single beds outa here~~
Erik (slendergiant): my dorm senior year was apartment style like that and any time my roommate would throw parties in the common area and people had to use the bathroom in our room while I was trying to sleep was always awkward and annoying
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): They establish they were originally split by gender and then when everyone hooked up they switched.
Jess (whoozica): HELL YEA
Erik (slendergiant): what happens when the boy/girl ratio is 3:1? ğŸ¤”
Erik (slendergiant): or vice versa
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): afaik most colleges still keep the roommates to single gender. 

That said, in my graduate school year Rowan started doing mixed gender housing. I question how many rooms had to be changed later due to breakups, but.
Erik (slendergiant): oh I thought we were talking about Beacon ğŸ˜…
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): Beacon they only *have* one room.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): There are no split rooms.
Erik (slendergiant): this is true
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): That floor plan is none canon.
Jess (whoozica): someone but team jnpr a new tv plz
Erik (slendergiant): just forget everything I said. my brain is fried from this week
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): <:valid:420824413592748032>
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): But still amusing. Beacon may be a higher education, exclusive school, but teenagers do stupid shit and they let the likes of *Yang* in. Can't imagine the rooming hasn't cause problems.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ğŸ‘€ 'scuse me?
Jess (whoozica): "heard you were talking shit"
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): If Yang didn't throw a party at some point I'd be disappointed.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): As would Qrow.
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~As would her memetic sex god father~~
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): nooooOOOOPPPPPPPEEEEEEEE
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Why is there two tho
Bill ğŸ“· (tlt_wm): eyes.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I love this >:3
