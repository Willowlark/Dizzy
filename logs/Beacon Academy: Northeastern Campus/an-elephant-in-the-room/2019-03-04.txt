Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: SO 
This past week there was basically a server wide shitting on Ethan  in vent support 
And it was decided that we would restart the channel to prevent casey, his current fiance from seeing it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I personally am going to take the stance of not doing that again
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: If you put something in vent-support, we aren't going to do a giant mass wipe of the entire channel,
partially cause its suspect AF
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but if you really are feeling that way, to the point of openly discussing it for hundreds and hundreds of messages with everybody in the server
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its on you to take care of your own tracks and delete the messages if you feel bad, or its on you to stick with what you say
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I know what I'm putting here isn't going to be popular and yall can be upset with me about it. 
But just pretending things are fine for casey, or always talking behind her back, isn't going to improve her situation, and its just gonna be creating a hotbed of secret shade
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: also idk if this chat is open to other people messaging
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i don't know how settings work i just made it so casey didn't have permission to be in it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: fixed it i think...?
Chris Onyx: I can reply
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ok

Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: "SO

Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Basically
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: if everybody doesn't like Ethan, and you all want to vent about it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: go for it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Reseting channels to prevent casey from seeing it isn't happening again
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: if you feel like you want to put something in Vent-support
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: you should feel fine doing so, this is a safe space
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: if you want to remove it, thats some you need to do
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: As admins of the server, there is some level of making sure stuff that can hurt other people doesn't stay up
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: (for example if somebody went off on a racist rant, we might delete that)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but you need to also be able to own what you say, and if you don't feel up to it, don't say it. I'm not going to have vent support be a place where everyone can complain and then we're hiding those complaints from other server members (in this case, Casey)
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: If you're worried about hurting her feelings, think before you speak
Anna (loud and likely blonde): im just lurking i can read everything though even if i leave so i think you got it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i figured most people are lurking on this one
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i mean im just clearing notifications~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah and most people will come to this when they want to clear theres
Chris Onyx: TL:DR;
From this point forward everyone will be individually responsible for moderating what is said in the chats, they will not be cleared to avoid offense

If you worry you will offend someone from a topic, it is entirely your discretion to stick to it or delete those messages
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah basically
Chris Onyx: Racism and other bullshit excluded tho
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yep
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ty Chris for helping me consolidate my constant mess of wondering thoughts into an understandable summary
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm leaving this chat up for now if anyone wants to comment
Mark (Mad Doctor): We've done without community guidelines in the past, but it's a Good Thing to reflect on how we interract in this group.  I think we can all agree that traditionally defined hate speech is right out. When it comes to talking about other people (like if I wanted to kvetch about an irritating student), it might be best to remember that marriage therapy guideline: don't say "this is what I don't like about you," say "when you do this, I feel X". I think that's a key difference from Callout culture, and it invites a dialogue and reconciliation
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I think we covered this when we made the call in the first place. We prioritized Caseyâ€™s feelings that one time, but the message is clear; nothing you say online is truly private. Weâ€™ve all seen and shared enough screen caps and blackball posts to know that. 

This server has never really had rules, and this isnâ€™t some shift to admins making rules, to be clear. Weâ€™re all friends and work together. Us unlucky ducks just get to deal with giving everyone colors and managing all the channels. If there comes a time we want to start making some rules, weâ€™ll do so together. Halâ€™s expressing just that, we make our own choices and we have to own the consequences of them.
Mark (Mad Doctor): To be clear, I wasn't suggesting rules, but rather a more constructive way to frame gripes
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah 
I'm not trying to set any rules here, and I know I come off rough a lot
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, what you said is incredibly insightful Mark.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Never frame as a comment on another person, frame as how you feel and let them think about how their actions have consequences.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~when will you learn WHEN will youLEARN your actions have consequences~~

All jokes aside, I agree with mark on this one. We should all probably work on forming better, healthier ways to air grievances, especially when it comes to other people. Lesson learned. But I think we can all agree on this and move on!
