Erik (Red Riot Thot): OMG MARK
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I dunno if any of you remember a couple weeks ago me posting to my story about this little cat that kept coming to the bed and breakfast where my sister had her wedding
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Her maid of honor messaged me tonight saying that the cat we adopted looks *incredibly* similar based on photos she took of the wedding cat
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I looked at the photos *I* took of wedding cat
Erik (Red Riot Thot): All the markings are the same. I remembered that the wedding cat had the same quirks and behaviors that ours does (kind of squinty eyes, lifting its front paws as it walks, rubbing his face on your hand, etc...)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Even has the same collar
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜±
Erik (Red Riot Thot): We fucking adopted the cat that crashed my sister's wedding and I'm screaming
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahhh thats so cool and cute!!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's fate that ya'll got him~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is some Hallmark movie bullshit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao honestly XD
Anna [Cyborg]: Not saying you have a familiar 
But you have a familiar
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Needless to say, we now have a name for him which is Stirling, named after the b&b we stayed in for the reception
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahh that sounds wonderful! ðŸ¤—
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good choice
