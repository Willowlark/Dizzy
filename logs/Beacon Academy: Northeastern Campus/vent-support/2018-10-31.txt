Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof I wish work would allow me to dress up but nope that’s unprofessional...

I wish I had a job where I could just sit and my desk, decorate it, dress up for Halloween at work, etc. maybe dye my hair whatever I want. 

Bleh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I really REALLY wouldn’t mind a desk job if I could make the same pay tbh but idk where to start looking
Jess (whoozica): Kinda resetting not wearing something, but i woke up with only 10 mins to get ready, and ive been feeling pretty sick, im in my my office all day alone since my coworker is out, and no ones really dresses up here. Its like an unspoken rule we arnt really allowed too, but i usually do something low key at elast
Marisa (Weeb): I literally can’t figure out where I live there’s a huge festival that sprung up while I was in school
Marisa (Weeb): I wonder how long the food vendors are gonna be there because they are loudly irasshaimase-ing
Marisa (Weeb): I am now sitting at an outdoor restaurant that popped up next to my apartment.
Jess (whoozica): but that means you found you apartment right? XD
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH ITS BEHIND THE CHOCOLATE BANANA STALL WITH STARS ON THE BANANAS
Marisa (Weeb): 
Jess (whoozica): thats beautiful
Marisa (Weeb): Ok so like. I knew about this festival ahead of time, it would’ve been impossible not to with how decorative the town is. But I didn’t know what it was. And I accidentally thought it was a sake festival because the kanji are similar and I wasn’t paying attention. So for the last month I thought they were gonna close down the street because everyone was going to be drunk.
Marisa (Weeb): I thought it said 酒 but it says 酉
Jess (whoozica): 😮 so whats the festival for?
Marisa (Weeb): It’s big. It’s called “tori no ichi” ~~I LEGIT THOUGHT ALL MONTH IT WAS SOMETHING CALLED ALCOHOL CITY MAN KANJI ARE WEIRD~~ and it’ll be held all month? Or at least three times this month. They sell rakes and I bought one for $30 because it rakes in the good fortune. Also my rake’s got a boar on it and I’m a boar child :3c
It’s basically LOTS of luck aaaand now someone’s drumming outside and it’s almost midnight
Marisa (Weeb): Man imagine if this was a Halloween festival
Marisa (Weeb): Ootori shine that’s where I live!! Pls no dox
Marisa (Weeb): People were lining up but a prayer costs $50+ today. People spend BIG BUCKS at this festival. Here’s what the main shrine gate looks like right now
Marisa (Weeb): 
Jess (whoozica): :O! thats so coo
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So production screwed up something on some cables and my boss asked me to ask our customer if it was still acceptable to send 😑
Marisa (Weeb): “It’s fine right? It’s fine. Take it.”
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea so today's been taking a turn for the worst. I think imma just go home, mess with cosplay stuff. Screw going out and doing anything Halloweeny. As the day goes on I just keep getting in a more bitter mood :X
Jess (whoozica): 😦 sorry to hear that, take it easy and relax
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Boss called and asked for my answer regarding taking over the quality role and I said no. Then he called back to ask if I was sure 😂
Jess (whoozica): "are you sure you're sure?"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *inserts john cena are you sure about that meme here*
Marisa (Weeb): "how about now"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Basically making sure I knew that there was a 10k pay increase I'm turning down I guess
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm most likely. He's probabaly like what turning down a pay increase? But little does he know... lol
Matt (mattmyers25): I want a pay a increase
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): mm.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think we all do Matt XD
