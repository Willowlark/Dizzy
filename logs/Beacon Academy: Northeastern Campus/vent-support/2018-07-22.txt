Rebecca (madameterralupus): Today's starting out great... My boss messed up the schedule so I opened the store an hour later -.-; 
And I turned away a customer cause I thought it was right until called my boss... WELP
Erik (slendergiant): Gotta have a chat with my boss tomorrow because I'm missing almost an entire day's pay from my last pay check ðŸ™ƒ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof that blows ðŸ˜«
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Hopefully itâ€™s just a mix up and theyâ€™ll fix it /:
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Chrisâ€™s new Qrow wig is pissing me off I had to use tacky glue to get it to hold
Erik (slendergiant): *yikes*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It looks okay now I just wish it didnâ€™t look so stiff and meh
Erik (slendergiant): The struggle for good short wigs is real hence why I'm going on version 4.0 for Taiyang
Erik (slendergiant): And especially for Qrow with that funky hairdo
