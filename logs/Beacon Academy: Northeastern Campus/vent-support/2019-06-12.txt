Jamie (Jamie): I feel like if one tells their significant other that class caused light anxiety attack after (cause ethics class and basically looking into who we are) they maybe should show some care even just a moments cuddle before continuing what needs done. Not saying "so?" And not a hint of understanding or care that anything not good occurred since im not outwardly upset right now
Jamie (Jamie): This is why i have a cat though, lily is completely ready to give all cuddles i need
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙁 yea... they should sit down and talk to you, see what's wrong, give comfort vocally and physically. Not just ignore it. I'm sorry...
Jamie (Jamie): Sadly used it with him now, my status is best decribed as complicated roommate thing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙁 I'm sorry... if you want to dm me privately and chat about things toonyou always can. I'm sorry bb. That sucks...
Jamie (Jamie): My focus is just finish school and financial stability and go from there 👌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sounds like a good plan. You got this bb!
Anna [Cyborg]: :( I am also here for u frien 
I've taken ethics also if u need to talk stuff on that note n vent cause it is indeed one hell of a subject
Jamie (Jamie): So fun choking on the taste and smell of chemical citrus when i walk downstairs in the morning. The level of too fucking much was reached and passed
