Mark (Mad Doctor): For some reason, the jockiest kids at my school view (but don't follow) my insta. I see them pop up in my stories. Some are cool and I think are genuinely interested in my odd hobbies. As for the others, I have no clue what their interest is. If they're looking to make fun of a nerdy teacher...well, snarking on social media about what other people are doing for fun seems pretty sad.
