Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm ready for inventory to be over ðŸ˜« I've been folding and going through T-shirt a for 2 hrs now...
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Oof. Inventory is the worst. Hope you get through it soon.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The day I make sure I have my shit together to not wake up later than needed and miss this one class I have missed for the past... week and a half... (?) we don't need to go in cause the quiz is online.. WELP.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Client messaged me at 2am last night. *I... wasn't working then.*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): are they like, international? or could they just not wait until the morning?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nope. It was just a status update.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): And she's local.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ah gotcha
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If she's that worried about deadlines, she should tell me what those deadlines are so I can take them seriously...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But if you dodge my questions about those deadlines, I sure as hell ain't working stupid hours per week.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Outlook won't connect. Guess I can't send or receive any work-related emails today Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): lucky.
Mark (Mad Doctor): The number of students who need to talk with me after class is directly proportional to how badly I have to pee
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Handle it college professor style.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Leave anyway.
Mark (Mad Doctor): If they were just seeking attention and validation, I would, but these were all pretty relevant questions
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~is that what my professors thought about me~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So my boss told us all to shut down our computers doke he resets our servers and whatnot... but literally all of my work requires using a computer... so I guess I'm just not working today?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh never mind. Server's back up
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 4 seats between me and the next nearest person near me.... and you gotta sit right next to me >.< Whyyy... just let me hide in the far back corner like a hermit. I don't want others around meeee
