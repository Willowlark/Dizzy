Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Oof. Inventory is the worst. Hope you get through it soon.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The day I make sure I have my shit together to not wake up later than needed and miss this one class I have missed for the past... week and a half... (?) we don't need to go in cause the quiz is online.. WELP.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Client messaged me at 2am last night. *I... wasn't working then.*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): are they like, international? or could they just not wait until the morning?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nope. It was just a status update.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): And she's local.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ah gotcha
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If she's that worried about deadlines, she should tell me what those deadlines are so I can take them seriously...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): But if you dodge my questions about those deadlines, I sure as hell ain't working stupid hours per week.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Outlook won't connect. Guess I can't send or receive any work-related emails today Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): lucky.
Mark (Mad Doctor): The number of students who need to talk with me after class is directly proportional to how badly I have to pee
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Handle it college professor style.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Leave anyway.
Mark (Mad Doctor): If they were just seeking attention and validation, I would, but these were all pretty relevant questions
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~is that what my professors thought about me~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So my boss told us all to shut down our computers doke he resets our servers and whatnot... but literally all of my work requires using a computer... so I guess I'm just not working today?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh never mind. Server's back up
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 4 seats between me and the next nearest person near me.... and you gotta sit right next to me >.< Whyyy... just let me hide in the far back corner like a hermit. I don't want others around meeee

Because I'm not a cartoon and my clothes do not abide by the laws of anime
Evie (Katheryne Knight):

Jess (whoozica): that person is cancelled
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Who.... Cares????
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It's not a big deal but it grinds my gears 

It's like when my friend got told her nose was wrong for the character she was cosplaying
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): why are they so...specific
Marisa (Mawisa): You can see eyes and mouth in the pic though canâ€™t you?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I literally said after that "because that's the way the costume wanted to behave that day" XD
Jess (whoozica): "why did u not recreat this image exactly the way is it?! AHHHHH"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Do people not know how hard it is sometimes to recreate a photo... it's never gonna be perfect... like damn calm down people
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I'm a potato what do you expect from me XD

Rebecca (madameterralupus): People are too picky...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): people need to fucking relax
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its just cosplay, and it looks good the way it is, it doesnt need to be 100% perfect match to the show
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP

Mark (Mad Doctor): Dude has literally not cosplayed yet. How often have we seen critics who have zero clue about what we do?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Look at game critics half the time they can't play games
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Although <@!229713389511901185> even if he's clogging up your comments, that's still giving that post a boost because people are commenting on it lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Truuuuu also he doesn't seem to know what PMimg means soooo
Marisa (Mawisa): Omg how old is this guy
Marisa (Mawisa): He sounds like a kid but any kid would know what a pm is
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's like half the reason I'm not going to take up an offer to be in their YouTube stuff. Also they have no portfolio.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Zeros2Heroes has a portfolio and he's a chill dude all around 

This guy?? Nothing. Has 4 insta posts.
Mark (Mad Doctor): *pretty sure no one over the age of 14 wants to cosplay Anakin Skywalker*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Unless it's Clone Wars Anakin
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good point.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The only acceptable incarnation of Anakin
Georgia (Something Sensible): Only THOTS would criticize cosplay like that
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~but also fuck that guy~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i survived my site visits but im now enraged because of  that person being a perfectionist gatekeeper. gtfo
