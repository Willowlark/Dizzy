ZombieHunter: So over this Vic crap.
Mark (Mad Doctor): At the very least he needs to take a long break from conventions and fandoms.
ZombieHunter: Agreed.
ZombieHunter: Iâ€™m listening to a few convention staff groups talking about banning him because they do actually have reports on him. Bleh.
Mark (Mad Doctor): One if my dad's favorite expressions is "When in a hole, stop digging." Vic and the governor of Virginia could learn from my dad
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I'm over it too. It was bound to happen though. 

I'm just wondering if RT is gonna kick him off the voice cast
Matt (mattmyers25): Problem is if they do that, then they need a replacement or write his character out of the show
Matt (mattmyers25): I wonder how many volumes are left for him. Like if they write him out, I want it done well and not half assed
Evie (Katheryne Knight): D. C. Douglas would be a decent replavement in my opinion
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah
Of course my trash ass wants some snowbird interaction before he gets the hook but that's me

It's sad cause I LOVE Qrow. I just wish he had a not trashy VA
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like people who know me know how much I love Qrow. XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): "He's with Glynda..."
ZombieHunter: LMFAO
ZombieHunter: Mark thank you for that.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lord help me... family just walked in and brother already pissy...~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ooooooof
Jess (whoozica): Give him a Snickers
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Drink an alcohol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~already got one. May need more...~~
