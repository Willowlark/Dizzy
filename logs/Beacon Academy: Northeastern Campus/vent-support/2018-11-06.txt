Rebecca (madameterralupus): Welpnothing I love more than getting a shower whilst walking to class 😫 I'm so freaking cold and tired of this rain...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anyone else ever get to anxious to politely ask to also use a outlet in a public place??
I need to charge my laptop to work on homework whilst I eat lunch but I'm too nervy to ask if I can plug it into the outlet they are sitting next to D:
Georgia (Something Sensible): I just say fuck it and barrel in
Georgia (Something Sensible): If they needed it then they would be using it ya know?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was half tempted to plug it in when they went to the bathroom... cause oof socializing with strangers no thanks
I mean they are using the one but not both >.>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeee so it’s fine they only usin one
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> He leaving. Time to take control of the plug. No awkward socializing for me!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I need to learn to get better at socializing with strangers, not be so anxious but fuck it~~
Jess (whoozica): It ussualy help me to reverse the situation in my head and then im like "oh yea thats like a totally normal thing i wouldn't think twice about someone asking"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao both me and an older lady jumped for the plug. Thankfully she was nice and let me plug my laptop in before she sat down 🙏 
And mhmm this is true. I'll have to think about that next time.I always just worry imma come off weird, cause I get nervous and stumble over my words a lot XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yea random note: I'm giving that Bob Evans from Saturday a review for their shitty ass hostess >.>
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Jess (whoozica): DO IT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I really wish I had spoken up to her. She was a true bitch, stereotyping us/treating us like children. I was tel my mom about her and even my mom was like that's uncalled for. She's like Bob Evans isn't just for old people.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😈 Review for that Bob Evans has been posted. RIP bitchy hostess lady.. you need to have an attitude check
