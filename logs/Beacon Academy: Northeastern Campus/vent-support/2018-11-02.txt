Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you are one half of irl anime couple~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~you come up on google search for yatori~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~that's how good you look~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): girl you goals.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *tfw someone says Happy Friday and it's about to lead into announcing there's some new problem that has to be fixed*
Mark (Mad Doctor): So, in the week before Homecoming, we have "Spirit Week," where each day student dress accordingly to a theme chosen by the seniors. Wednesday is "High School Stereotype" day. Seniors dress like jocks, Juniors like preppies, sophomores like hippies, and freshmen like...wait for it...nerds. Am I wrong to be offended?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I think I’d want to be the nerd group
Georgia (Something Sensible): I see where the seniors were coming from “haha freshmen suck so they’re nerds”
Georgia (Something Sensible): My high school didn’t really like nerds so that’s sadly the common stereotype
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~which is weird cause I get to college and say I’m a nerd and everyone’s like “me too”~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): I just vented to a bunch of administrators. I compared it to "Dress like a Latinx Day." Well, how do they dress? There are so many funny representations on the media I can use as a guide...
The first three categories are not inherently hurtful, nor do they isolate any current groups of students. Add to the fact that at our sports crazy school, nerds are already on the margins
Erik (Red Riot Thot): We had theme days too. My junior year we were nerds
Jess (whoozica): yea i think there def a bad connotation being portrayed there with the freshmen being nerds since they are both kinda labeled as "losers"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hippie also feels like a negative connotation...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel like it should be hipster, not hippie anyway. Not as many hippies nowadays
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Unless that's the better term for "stoner"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Honestly I think the freshmen got the best theme anyway? Wear all your nerd merch and embrace it
Jess (whoozica): wheres the "goths?"
Jess (whoozica): the real problem here is that all 4 grades should be nerds cuz everyone's a nerd about something
Mark (Mad Doctor): We have the "art crowd," who overlap with nerds quite a lot. But even then, none really embraces the crunchy granola stereotype.  A lot of my nerd club are freshmen. I asked them on discord how they were planning to dress. No answers yet. I'm sure a lot of kids will wear Batman shirts, but they were actually encouraged to wear the pocket protector/taped glasses/sweater vest and bow tie look. To me, that sends a message to the real nerds that "this is how we see you."
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I agree with Erik... Nerd culture is way more mainstream now.
Jess (whoozica): yea totally, I think it would be cooler if everyone just wore some type of fandom t-shirt. cuz like i feel like I've never even seen someone who looks like "stereotypical" nerd?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Pocket Protectors is an insult yeah... and I know you've had troubles in the school before with Nerd bashing... But at the same time own nerd culture. No one should be ashamed to show their nerdy side.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everyone is supposed to do it right? So even the jocks are supposed to fandom up...
Jess (whoozica): jocks ARE nerds XD they just nerd out about sports
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): TRUE
Jess (whoozica): in highschool I had and (ex) friend who made fun of me for dating "nerds" while wearing harry potter merch and geeking out over disney everyday LIKE HALLO U ARE NERD TOO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, if it was Tech (our HS) no one would have done it anyway cause school spirit was rock bottom.
Jess (whoozica): YEET
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you might have some more spirit cause private school tho.
Mark (Mad Doctor): The thing is, most kids don't equate nerd with fandom. To them, "nerd" remains defined as "socially awkward"
Jess (whoozica): yea you're right 😦
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): but on the other side of the coin we're add-ults who have had time to grow into our nerdiness. Kids are going to find it much harder to own their nerd.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And I think you have the best understanding of the modern teenager out of all of us.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Add to that the fact that my nerd herd suffers disproportionately from anxiety and depression
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So owning it is harder...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well they could always not do spirit week. ~~I expect that's the majority of people anyway~~
Jess (whoozica): yea they have alot working against them 😦 I'm glad they have you to support and advocate for and with them
Mark (Mad Doctor): From a similar day two years ago. It hangs in the hall
Jess (whoozica): damn they all stole my glasses what the heck
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Personally, I don't take any offense in it. That's how we all dressed for our nerd theme day. No one had issue with it. We didn't look too deep into it and just had fun with it. Most of us were all nerds in some capacity and I think since we knew it was an over-exaggerated stereotype that didn't reflect the reality of nerd culture, no one made a big deal of it.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But that's just my experience
Mark (Mad Doctor): It feels different here to me because this is such a preppy/jock school, and nerds are already at the margins of the culture. They wouldn't think of doing a LGBTQ day, an Italian day, or an Asian day, because those stereotypes are universally regarded as offensive. They actually had a "white trash" ten years ago, and the people who planned it were shocked when some found it  offensive.  The very idea of a stereotype is to reduce a group of people to a cariacture so you don't have to deal with them as individuals.
Jess (whoozica): " The very idea of a stereotype is to reduce a group of people to a cariacture so you don't have to deal with them as individuals." Im gonna borrow that from you at some point, that is so good
Georgia (Something Sensible): It must feel different as a student too
Georgia (Something Sensible): When you’re a teen and see that and think “oh yeah, of course nerds are the bottom of the totem pole”
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm also offended by "pajama day" next Monday
Not really. I'm gonna wear my TARDIS bathrobe
Jess (whoozica): I WANT PJ DAY SO BAD but we arent even allowed to wear jeans RIP
Mark (Mad Doctor): Last year, Audrey's division did "Dress like your favorite character day" which I think is brilliant. But I might be biased
Georgia (Something Sensible): In college every day is pj day lol
