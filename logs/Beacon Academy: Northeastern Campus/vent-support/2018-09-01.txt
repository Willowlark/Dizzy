Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I talked to my mom the other day about my laptop acting up. She apparently talked to my dad tonight about it when I was at work.... a blessing as finally hit me 🙏🏻 he got 3 year insurance on it and it's still good till October. So we are going to send it in to get fixed and if they can't fix it I'll get a new one 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): HUZZAH!
Erik (slendergiant): Yo those insurance plans can really help. My first laptop was part of a scholarship and had 4 year service warranty on it. Had to use it twice. But it was nice because they just sent someone to my house to fix it right there
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm! I am glad my dad is smart and thought to get insurance on it and one for so long 🙏 It's really coming in handy with this issue lol. And oof I wish they'd send someone to my house to fix it, one downfall of this is I got to send it away to be fixed so imma be out of a computer till then <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> (will just have to use the old one meh)
Georgia (Something Sensible): So we have sales and service receptionists at my work
Georgia (Something Sensible): And today's the first day I'm doing service because we had no one else to cover
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I find out the weekly service receptionist hasn't been scanning receipts
Georgia (Something Sensible): So there's like 200 papers that need scanning
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gotta earn that paycheck.
Georgia (Something Sensible): You're not wrong
Georgia (Something Sensible): _but that just means the weekday service receptionist hasn't been earning hers_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gooooing to point that out?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk if I rat her out she's gonna get yelled at
Georgia (Something Sensible): I'm kinda neutral to her as a person
