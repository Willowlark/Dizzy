Heather (batgoddesscosplay): It's good to have a job you like ♡ I'm sorry your other one isnt working out
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷🏻‍♀️ it is but thankfully I enjoy my other job and can fall back on that one. Plus more room to grow/climb up the ladder at that one then the other. Lol. 
Also decided I've giving my two weeks this weekend and not next. Ya girl wants out sooon xD
