Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I'm trying to set up a Venmo account and when I went to add my phone number, it said there was already an account attached to it so then I figured I'd try to sign in with my phone and it wanted to send an email verification to the email it's attached to. They only show the first and last letters of the email address and I don't have an email that begins and ends with those letters...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ...That's kind of odd. Guess someone set up an account and threw in a random phone number that happened to be yours. Maybe you can contact the company to un-link that phone number somehow so you can connect it to your account.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Got it sorted out. Had to send them a screenshot of my phone statement to prove I owned that number lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Well at least ya got it sorted out ðŸ‘Œ
