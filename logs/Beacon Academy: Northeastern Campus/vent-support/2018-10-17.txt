Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ah I see now why this conversation was started...
Georgia (Something Sensible): I didn’t think I was big enough to have to give someone a “I don’t date fans” talk
Georgia (Something Sensible): But hey 4K may be the threshold for that!
Marisa (Weeb): "this person with 4000+ followers might be interested in *me*! the person they've never met or spoken to ever and know nothing about!"
Jess (whoozica): The classic
Georgia (Something Sensible): Marisa you’re my boyfriend now if anyone asks
Georgia (Something Sensible): The trade off is that Marisa will defend from the oddballs and in return I will wear maximum Yona cosplay
Marisa (Weeb): GOOD TRADEOFF
more yona pls
i've been practicing high kicks i'll kick anyone in the throat
Marisa (Weeb): if anyone needs a pic of your bf show them this
https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UnrealisticFeistyFirecrest-small.gif
Georgia (Something Sensible): “If you have a BF what does he look like” *shows anime boi*
Marisa (Weeb): And if anyone needs a GF I’ll mail you one of these bad boys
Georgia (Something Sensible): EXCELLENT
Erik (slendergiant): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ;;
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 20 gfriends... thats a lot lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Well, he's a tol boi.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's a lot of rotating periods though, lots of mood swings.

 Unless you get lucky and they all sync up
Georgia (Something Sensible): or really UNLUCKY
Georgia (Something Sensible): lmao 20 people on high amounts of hormones at once? d e a t h
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YIKES
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): TRUE
Matt (mattmyers25): Imagine all of that in 1 building, in college
Georgia (Something Sensible): you just described a dorm
Erik (slendergiant): You just described a sorority house
Georgia (Something Sensible): TRUE
ZombieHunter: End me
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Y’all the weirdos are comin our
Mark (Mad Doctor): That one is entering yikes territory
Erik (slendergiant): like what the fuck? 😂
Jess (whoozica): Im sorry, WHAT?!
Jess (whoozica): who does this? like "wow that girl is cute, i think ill send her a reall creepy-almost poem like message to woe her"
Georgia (Something Sensible): IK what does it even MEAN
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): instablock
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everyone needs to liberally apply the block account button.
Jess (whoozica): block him for sure but like WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. I feel like im in english class trying to decode old english
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): pretty sure it's gore.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): skin tears asunder?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): creep.
Georgia (Something Sensible): does that mean til i die
Georgia (Something Sensible): is he professing undying love without even meeting me? oh lordy
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Whhhhhhhatttttt
Jess (whoozica): would you love me if all your skin fell off and no one loved you?
Jess (whoozica): when all your skin falls off and no one loves you, only then will you be able to see that i am the man of your dreams
Georgia (Something Sensible): a very interesting proposal indeed
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): 
Jess (whoozica): lmaooooo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMFaO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ERIK
Erik (slendergiant): Wow Google Translate has really come a long way
Georgia (Something Sensible): LMAO THANKS ERIK
Georgia (Something Sensible): so true so true
Tom (tomukuncosplay): OMG YES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao that translation
Mark (Mad Doctor): I love that Google translate tool. I can think of a million applications
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Wow I didn’t know there was a fuckboy translator
Jess (whoozica): ye i understand i was thinking about starting a ko-fi but like idk
Jess (whoozica): i realize this looks totally out of context but yeaa continuation of Gen's convo from spoliers <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have a KoFi, but no one supports it 
Either I’m not pushing hard enough or I’m not producing enough content and I always get super stress which causes me to not work on stuff XD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s a never ending cycle
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But you’re pretty well known so I think you’ll be fine ^^_
Jess (whoozica): awww thanks ❤ i mean i guess theres no harm in opening it? like theres nothing to lose
Jess (whoozica): i get like overly motivated for a lil while and then like nothin for months
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THATS M E
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s SUPER ME
Erik (slendergiant): I don't really plan on monetizing my cosplay because I'm fortunate that I can comfortably fund my projects on my own, but like, I have a link in my Linktree to donate to the AFSP so if people want to throw money at me, I'd just send them there
Jess (whoozica): yea I get that, like i think im just feeling the financial effects con season took and im like "oof"
snow ( karma chameleon ): I feel like it’s kinda hard to expect any money from people as a cosplayer
Erik (slendergiant): I once actually had someone message me saying they wanted to support me financially somehow and I think I forgot to respond because I wasn't really sure what to say. Like, thanks but I really don't need your money? Put it towards someone or something else who needs it more
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Same boat, I don't need Kofi funds, and I'm blessed that way. People have asked me before about paying me tho, and my attitude was do what you want, I'm not asking and I won't, so Kofi lets them do they're own thing.
Jess (whoozica): OH YEA def, trust me i wont be expecting anything
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Maybe I’m just looking at everything the wrong way
snow ( karma chameleon ): I think it’s fine to have a ko-fi and plug it but too many people expect to finish cosplays / get stuff that way and it isn’t realistic despite what u might see
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's not reliable income.
Jess (whoozica): i mean theres 2 ways too look at it i think?: This is an art and the arts deserve to be supported and you are doing this for fun so money is unessesary
snow ( karma chameleon ): then again I just personally don’t understand patreon n that kinda stuff, I would never do patreon
snow ( karma chameleon ): I like kofi bc it’s almost like a tipping service xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): which is the 3rd way to look at it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If people want to do something, it's an option that's not sticking singles in a camera bag (cough <@!301927856240459777>)
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’ve always done cosplay for fun, not for a business
Erik (slendergiant): That actually makes a lot of sense if you look at it more as a tipping service
snow ( karma chameleon ): RIGHT
snow ( karma chameleon ): like I don’t expect people to support me but if they want to that’s cool beans’
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Patreon... makes it a job? Like, if you want to do a cosplay, and your fans are like 'eh, you should do this cosplay instead' you feel swayed to satisfy your supporters.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fuck em. Do your own thing.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Kofi goals slide to that category, you're stuck promising someone you'll do something, which can make it feel like work.
Jess (whoozica): yea like if i had a ko-fi it would be more of a tipping kinda thing? but ALSO if i DO open one none of yall i know aint swimming it it better donate ok?
snow ( karma chameleon ): patreon also seems hard to keep up with? Like you promise photoshoot, u gotta pay for the photo shoots and costumes n stuff, are u even making that much through it to support ur own patreon?
Jess (whoozica): yea pateron is big scary
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah patreon seems to make it more of a job because you need to keep up with the content you promise your patrons
Jess (whoozica): im still on the edge with ko-fi
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's an interesting question. I'd love to see a statistic on how much you need from Patreon to support your work.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): DO IT
Jess (whoozica): PERSONALLY that is
snow ( karma chameleon ): patreon seems dumb but that’s just me
snow ( karma chameleon ): SAME BILL
snow ( karma chameleon ): SAME
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Seriously, you open it, you mention it exists, then you can forget it exists.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~thats what happened to me~~
Jess (whoozica): i think patreon works for the right type of person, i just dont want the presure
snow ( karma chameleon ): Too many people aspire to get a patreon and get big and turn their cosplaying into a Big Thing which is fine but..... there’s also cosplaying for fun and not worrying about it paying ur bills
Jess (whoozica): ye!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Plus fame is more trouble than it's worth imo.
snow ( karma chameleon ): o i bet it is
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i started a patreon, it lasted one day and then i promptly deleted it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): hard pass
Erik (slendergiant): Also if you make enough through patreon I'm sure you'd have to claim that on your taxes which might be another hassle (unless Patreon takes care of that for you?)
snow ( karma chameleon ): omg leanna
snow ( karma chameleon ): Mood
snow ( karma chameleon ): Patreon also takes out money for itself
Erik (slendergiant): I made a patreon to support someone on patreon and then saw "Ooh I can switch to a creator profile that easily?" And did... and then switched back because I realized I'd never use it for that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cosplay is a weird thing to back anyway...
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’ve never made one and never will ~~even tho my gf asked me to~~
snow ( karma chameleon ): RIGHT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Unless you do it for the sake of getting paid...
snow ( karma chameleon ): is it salty to say I don’t get people who expect to have cosplay as their only career
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I guess it's possible there'll be people who just want to give... you money, every month... to afford your dress up hobby?
snow ( karma chameleon ): ugh that’s WEIRD
snow ( karma chameleon ): SUBSCRIBE TO MY HOBBY UWU
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have a kofi and it's in my linktree on my profile but I never promote it cause I don't like asking for money. It just feels weird to me to be like hey guys gimme money so I can do more costumes. If someone finds it and drops some in there cool I guess but eh. Also I began cosplaying when it was something you did for fun and you funded on your own sooo i stick to that logic lol.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, I back a few artists (Bach for one) but I wouldn't want to back a cosplayer I follow. They're both content creators, I'm not sure where the difference is in my head.
snow ( karma chameleon ): I have a kofi and I was gonna promo it today XD but I got straight up asked to by someone so idk what’s happening anymore
snow ( karma chameleon ): I feel like there’s a difference
snow ( karma chameleon ): making MAYBE 200 a month on patreon ain’t shit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I can't pin what the difference is though.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm like I debated on promo-ing my kofi some but eh again just feels weird to me personally. I'd prefer to fund myself. The only "help" I'll take to fund my cosplays is my parents getting me stuff for holidays lol
snow ( karma chameleon ): there’s more diverse content with art, unless a cosplayer is doing new costumes every single month
Jess (whoozica): pateron is "pay me to make stuff" ko-fi is "throw me a few bucks if you feel like it no pressure, its just to help me offset costs a teeny bit" the whole concept is "buying someone a coffee" so i think that makes it more friendly
snow ( karma chameleon ): Valid!
snow ( karma chameleon ): I like kofi as a tipping service
snow ( karma chameleon ): plus it isn’t subscription
snow ( karma chameleon ): You can give one kofi and that’s that
Jess (whoozica): ye
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm see that part of kofi I don't mind. I think what bugs me most is a lot of people I follow are like ahh donate donate to help me make this costume, buy this thing for my SO or other odd things... they make like actually begging for money and I'm like bruhhh
snow ( karma chameleon ): I see a lot of people begging for money all the time and I don’t really understand besides the fact they don’t want to get a job
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GONNA BE REAL SALTY FOR A SEC... i personally hate ...when cosplayers randomly push their wishlists
snow ( karma chameleon ): VALID
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That one I never got.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "HI I MADE A HUGE LIST OF ITEMS I WANT BUT WONT SPEND MY OWN MONEY ON, PLEASE BUY THEM FOR ME :D"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I want this, buy it for me. why? cause I'm cute.
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m dying I love u all and ur salt
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -posts tiddy pic- "my wishlist is in my linktree"
snow ( karma chameleon ): JDKSNKFNDKENDKDN
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Only time I push my wishlists is when someone like family/friends are like whatcha want for bday or Christmas xD 
Which is a valid and reasonable time to push it and I do so privately cause yeaaa
snow ( karma chameleon ): Don’t forget my wishlist is full of stuff I don’t wanna buy so you should uwu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMaO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): To be fair.
snow ( karma chameleon ): sometimes I’m just. So tempted to be like GET A JOOOOOOB and that’s mean
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sex sells.
Erik (slendergiant): I have a cosplay wishlist but it's basically my "save for later, but in an organized way" list
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^thats valid
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i do too
snow ( karma chameleon ): I have a gamora list that I gotta work on
Jess (whoozica): my mom just asked what i want for christmas and im like "uhhh, leather paint, a black bodysuit, a dark blue cape??"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i think the difference is the  intent with it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you want to be successful making money on cosplay, it's going to be via lewd shoots. At that point, the type of people following you will buy stuff.
snow ( karma chameleon ): u just gotta be aware ur supporters are perverts
Erik (slendergiant): ^
Jess (whoozica): i have a wishlist but it private
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have a list of craft supplies and cosplay items. I just have it saved for me personally so I know what I want to buy at some point in life. Or like I said share when he like whatcha want for this holiday? XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fame isn't a good thing~
snow ( karma chameleon ): depends what for
Erik (slendergiant): *"Thanks for buying me this lingerie set clearly because you want to see me wearing it"*
snow ( karma chameleon ): I wanna be a famous mystery machine
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The mindless horde in your follower count is not your friends~
Jess (whoozica): "what do you want for chistmas?"
"uhhh joanns and amazon gcs?"
snow ( karma chameleon ): wise words from bill, ur follower count isn’t ur life or ur friends
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh, was that an option for you Erik? <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Taiyang boudoir when.
Erik (slendergiant): I mean, that might be the way to get me to do Red Riot Hood
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the cat's out of the bag, someone wants a bellabooty shoot
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Only time I would may have people donate is to follow a boudoir account... but it's probs never gonna happen and if I do ever do... let's be honest only friends will ever be able to follow it cause ewww randos 😂
snow ( karma chameleon ): Subscribe to my one million dollar patreon tier for a saucy bellabooty shoot!!!!!1!!1111!!!!!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I like something I saw recently for boudoir, they used a private account so they could keep the people they *do know* out.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So no awkward grandma finding your boudoir photos.
snow ( karma chameleon ): Honestly if I did that, it’s going on my regular account. I have no fucks to give
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I never thought of using private account like that, so it was interesting.
Jess (whoozica): thats how id have to do it if i did
Erik (slendergiant): ~~or 3rd party sites posting them other places~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^^ what I plan to do if I ever do it. Like it would be private so randos have to be allowed in and family can't find lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Repeat after me, *anything* you put online for even a *moment* is forever online.
snow ( karma chameleon ): VALID
Jess (whoozica): *makes private boudoir account*
*only lets you guys in*
snow ( karma chameleon ): lmfao and people wonder why I don’t use my real name online..
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's valid Jess jess.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There is no anonymity, and you can be held accountable for anything you say or do. People forget that thinking 'trolling is normal, and no one knows whose who there' but you should treat interacting online the same way as you would in person.
Jess (whoozica): so awkwardly?
snow ( karma chameleon ): I just don’t use my name so jobs can’t find me 👌
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If you wouldn't share or say it to the person/group/entity, don't do it online.
Jess (whoozica): 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Spontaneous lecture over.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): >Bill says what you put online lasts forever which is valid
> me: lol maybe those darlifa arcade photos should go on a private account since some are kinda odd to be public 😂
snow ( karma chameleon ): much appreciated lecture
snow ( karma chameleon ): HAHAHAHAHA
snow ( karma chameleon ): I enjoyed this conversation, it’s nice to know I’m not the only one who feels this way about patreon shit
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof 
I kinda feel a like a shitty person...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you are not.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): so.
Jess (whoozica): NO NOT ALLOWED
Erik (slendergiant): Yes, please let's forget that Darlifra shoot happened . It was so bad xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂😂 it was hilarious but awkward
Erik (slendergiant): ~~although I think that couple are still waiting on their pictures~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Leanna was the one who suggested the awkward poses lmfao~~
And yeaa
snow ( karma chameleon ): Listen I still haven’t gotten cce photos back either
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): People can do whatever they choose. My not backing patreons for cosplay doesn't mean there isn't a really nice person out there who supports cosplay genuinely. Some people use Patreon for lewd stuff and enjoy that, others are looking for serious supporters and strive to different goals. 

Stereotypes are just that, stereotypes.
snow ( karma chameleon ): Also sh don’t judge me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol we no judge girl, take your time 💕
snow ( karma chameleon ): MAYBE IF U SUBSCRIBE TO MY PATREON ITD BE FASTER
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@!229713389511901185> why you feel that way?
Erik (slendergiant): I support the one (1) creator I support on Patreon because I genuinely like her as a creator and as a person, ~~but also because it's neat being in her Discord...~~
snow ( karma chameleon ): I wanna kno who 👀
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Whomst do you support? 😦
Erik (slendergiant): Zonbie's Workshop
snow ( karma chameleon ): ooooooOo!!!!!!!
Erik (slendergiant): GRACE IS SUCH A GOOFY SWEETHEART AND I LOVE HER
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’ve been thinking about supporting one cosplayer who is also in a wheelchair and I love her but I’m also not Financially Stable
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh, I'm in a patreon exclusive discord but I just muted it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If there's more than 50 people in a server I just kinda give up.
snow ( karma chameleon ): _war flashbacks_
Erik (slendergiant): there's like, less than 40 in hers and not super active but occasionally she pops in to comment on progress pictures of things her supporters have made which I admire a lot about her
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's nice, yeah.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just get... I don't want to say overwhelmed, but overwhelmed with tons of users and channels. I don't have a clear entry point, no idea who the regulars are, and I don't know where to lurk to learn.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's much harder to lurk on discord than irc.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's more like it's not worth the effort to get involved in that community.
Jess (whoozica): <@!229713389511901185>  you are a great cosplayer, If you want to make a patreon I think you should go for it, i think what people were referring too only addresses only a portion of cosplayers, you are always working hard at both cosplay and you're regular job/life you have a great variety of cosplays and a personality people will find fun and and want to support as a person (like erik was just saying)
Erik (slendergiant): and going back to what Bill said about "sex sells" it's unfortunately true, and while I don't mean to sound like I'm slut-shaming, but people like Jess Nigri (who *is* a very talented creator, don't get me wrong) but a lot of her stuff is really popular because tiddies and another thing I admire about Zonbi is that she doesn't use her body like that? Like, a lot of her builds are full body armor that shows literally zero skin
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So you're a genuine supporter of the human, not the titty.
Erik (slendergiant): Correct
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Continue being a role model for the fuckbois of the world to learn from.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't think it's *right* that sex sells, but... Men are stupid.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Especially the classic anime fan stereotype.
Erik (slendergiant): Ugh, *men*... 😒
Jess (whoozica): *looks up zonbi*
oh... goals af
Georgia (Something Sensible): Are we still talking patreon or am I too late
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): On and off.
snow ( karma chameleon ): I absolutely believe there are cosplayers out there who use patreon for the right reason and that’s valid
Georgia (Something Sensible): I agree Kofi is a tipping service, and patreon is more subscribing to regular content. Wishlists I usually post as an alternative to kofi? So if people are worried I’ll spend the money on DRUGS then they know it’s actually for foam
Jess (whoozica): damnit georiga i KNEW it
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cowbutt crunchies uses patreon to distribute tutorials and all the proceeds go to cat shelters
snow ( karma chameleon ): AW
Georgia (Something Sensible): HAHA U GOT Me I do all the drugs
snow ( karma chameleon ): ur confusing drugs for _druuUUUuuuUuuuUuugs_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): drogas
snow ( karma chameleon ): khal drogo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): khal drogas
snow ( karma chameleon ): insta wise rice is on that khal drogas
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tru facts
Georgia (Something Sensible): But yeah idk sometimes people want to see specific things too
Georgia (Something Sensible): and I’m like whatever my dudes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like if someone paid for materials for 3.0 Pyrrha because they wanted to see me do it that much, I’d be like, cool beans
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like someone bought me a 50 dollar airbrush kit off my wishlist anonymously for my birthday
Georgia (Something Sensible): It wasn’t that I wasn’t gonna buy it myself but they were just so hype to see cosplay progress that they bought it for me
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tho I agree, it’s annoying when people are like “I wanna cosplay this thing, everyone pay for it for me”
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but you also dont have a wishlist with the intent to plug it every few days
snow ( karma chameleon ): You can tell the difference between someone genuine and someone who KEEPS begging for money
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): with a phot of yourself going "lost my job but i still wanna make content for ya'll."
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ye what snow said
Georgia (Something Sensible): “Lost my job but still spending $600 to fly cross country for con!!!!! Hahaha!!!”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tru facts
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "i am jobless and about to lose my home, heres a list of 500 items i need for cosplay"
Georgia (Something Sensible): That being said, I have no problem with patreon, I’m kinda miffed it has such a sexy reputation
Georgia (Something Sensible): “My grandma needs open heart surgery, transfer me 300 dollars for a cosplay for her funeral!”
snow ( karma chameleon ): LOL
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fun fact Georgia, you're big enough you have creepo fans, so... You may end up with someone trying to buy you cosplays because they want to see you in them.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im honestly CACKLING
Georgia (Something Sensible): They can only buy me cosplays that are on my wishlist, which are cosplays I’d want anyways  😎
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like if someone gets me a virgin killer sweater I’ll just wear it..... over a full body neon pink zentai suit 😂
snow ( karma chameleon ): NDWLNDKDNDKD now that’s the quality content I’d sign up for
Georgia (Something Sensible): Subscribe to my patreon for me trolling the shit out of perverts
Erik (slendergiant): HOLY SHIT YES
Georgia (Something Sensible): Which again, I have no problem with people doing Virgin killer, it’s just not me
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s kinda like, you do cosplay your way, I’ll do cosplay my way
Georgia (Something Sensible): The only thing that irritates me is if people ask me to do boudoir when I clearly don’t want to
Georgia (Something Sensible): Or vice versa
Georgia (Something Sensible): Moral of the story: ✨ let people cosplay the way they want to as long as they’re not hurting anyone ✨
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ preach
Jess (whoozica): YES THAT
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also follow up thought, making money off of cosplay is included as an acceptable form of cosplay
Georgia (Something Sensible): Some people get like 400 dollars a month for patreon like damn you go
snow ( karma chameleon ): I know one cosplayer sorta in the community who gets 2000
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s 2000 a month for 12 months, 24,000 dollars
Georgia (Something Sensible): From just shipping out prints and patreon rewards for a couple hours
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s pretty damn good 👌
snow ( karma chameleon ): Agreed, some people can make it work for sure
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just guess I feel shitty cause like I don’t wanna come off like I’m begging for money for my KoFi but I feel I am?

And like...I don’t wanna sound like a greedy fuck. But I guess I am?

Idk I guess I’m just trying to make something happen that’s just not meant to happen.
Jess (whoozica): Nah, I don't think you come off like that at all
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nope. Until you post 20 stories about your patreon tiers every day you aren’t begging.
