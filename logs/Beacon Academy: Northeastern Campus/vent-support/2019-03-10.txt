Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay that's cool.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If you're part of the group and they just didn't message you that low.

Anna (loud and likely blonde): Did you put it on delicate? It'll prob stay on but not well ;-;
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I haven't washed it yet. Usually always do my costume stuff on delicate anyways. But like wtf?? It's stuff for fabric to permanently hold shit and like...?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was so confused when I read that on it. Like uhhh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yet... looking at it on the site it says machine washable. O.o
Rebecca (madameterralupus): NANI... Idk. Maybe it's water soluble on things that aren't fabric just was worded weird. We shall see when I wash it tomorrow. LOL
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Bizzare. It sounds like it's water based not water soluble but like. Still put it on delicate then
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Does it say just "water soluble" or "water soluble until dry"?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think it just said water soluble but can't recall. I will look again when I go into the basement in a bit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay yea it says until dry. So I should be good then. Phew
