Mark (Mad Doctor): So last year at J1, Audrey's Penny cosplay won a prize in their contest. The prize was a spot in the commercial they're running on the Cartoon Network for this year's con. We never heard back, and I assumed that was because the staff had their hands full with the move to a new venue. However, five minutes ago, I get a text that they're shooting the spot THIS SUNDAY from 10-4. Nice to give us notice...
Jess (whoozica): Are you kidding?! 😭
Mark (Mad Doctor): Audrey says screw them. I'm inclined to agree.
Jess (whoozica): Seriously less than one weeks notice is not enough
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Def screw em. That’s just sketchy.
Mark (Mad Doctor): The con is only 3.5 weeks away. They had a year
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeaah thats pretty lame not gonna lie
Mark (Mad Doctor): BNE comes first
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof yea that is cutting it close. Like wayy too close. Sheesh... <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): But hell yea for fam coming first~ ❤
Marisa (Weeb): Yee J1 is a little sketch. Before they were an actual con they ran “anime experiences” and one was in a massage parlor. The game room was like 3 different massage rooms with a TV and controllers crammed inside that could fit maaaaybe three people if two sat on the bed and one stood up.
Erik (slendergiant): so someone called regarding a position I applied to and left a voicemail. I called them back and got their voicemail and am still waiting for them to call me back
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Such is a phone tag.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What kind of position?
Erik (slendergiant): Like a junior mechanical engineering type position. The job description isn't super detailed but it seems to be something I'd definitely be qualified for
Erik (slendergiant): It's a contract position though but honestly I'll even take that if it means getting the hell out of here
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): A lot of places are doing contract to hire. Easier than hiring and firing.
