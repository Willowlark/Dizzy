ZombieHunter: Warning: self harm and depression 

||i don’t know what’s wrong with me and I’m yelling at all the wrong people. I got home from a snack with family and laid down in my bed just to start crying uncontrollably. Like I want to hurt myself or worse and I. I don’t know where else to go right now. I just know I’m not okay. ||
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: <@169297844874903552> I might have some of the zenkai stuff if it actually added to my drop box. Is it somewhere in your trash by accident?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ...shouldnt be and I hope not cause I mass emptied it hte other night >.<

Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷 Gonna try all I can. Im just like huh thats whack...
ZombieHunter: Things that happened today: 
was accused of bullying someone on Instagram. 
Ate all@the food. 
Cried for 30 minutes straight but also shrugged when people asked if I’ll@be okay and laughed 
Screamed at people cuz I don’t know how to tell them I need them to help me be stable 
And possibly lose some sanity.
ZombieHunter: I’m not having a good day
ZombieHunter: You know. The creepy smile
ZombieHunter: Like you’ve had enough and you smile at stuff and it makes you twitch a little all day like in cartoons
ZombieHunter: That’s me. Right now.

Rebecca (madameterralupus): So my moms office hired a tax guy to do stuff.... He's been kinda problematic so while I am running the opffice I am keeping tabs to see if he acts any worse when they are all out of the office. So far... YUP. He hasn't showed up at all and now called saying going to work from home... hmmm
Matt (lastbetatestercosplay): I can take his place and be the better employee lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao probably. You at least know to dress properly for an office job where you see clients, and actually come into work on time and just... in general lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like... Hell this isnt even my real jopb and I know how to dress and show up on time. I was actually early this morning lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂 My Nana just called the office looking to talk to my mom... She didnt even recognize it was me. ~~Nor did I let her know cause didnt wanna be on the phone forever.~~
