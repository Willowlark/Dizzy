Evie (Katheryne Knight): I came into work at 8:30 when I was suppose to be in at 9:30 and I couldn’t leave because they are repaving the entire parking lot around my bank O O P S
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Its dead fam 
There’s gonna be tops 20 people coming into the bank through the day.
Jess (whoozica): easy day then? 😮
Erik (slendergiant): either that or an incredibly long day. slow days can be the worst
Jess (whoozica): oh yea i feel that
snow ( crescentbladed ): slow days are torture imo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I’m doing things but I look at the clock and it’s like WELP ONLY 20 minutes have passed >.<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay I’m taking deep breaths.
I will find some good in this day
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m derermined
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gen right now:
Evie (Katheryne Knight): HAHAAAA ACTUALLY
Evie (Katheryne Knight): HIM YELKING AT WINTER HAD ME DYING
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She could learn a thing or two
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): MOOD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okat I’ve been ranting and raving in two chats. One I shouldn’t have been. No more negativity for the day.
Erik (slendergiant): I completely forgot about Chibi... so naturally I took 4 minutes of company time to watch it just now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good xD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I only watched the skit that RT put out on their Twitter with Kline
Jess (whoozica): ~~Opps me too~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Eh, rant and rave. It's that good kind of ranting which you just need to *say* at it feels better.
Erik (slendergiant): mind = blown
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I love the nods to fairy tales like omg
Jess (whoozica): OK so I need to know if I'm the only one with this problem. You guys know how alot of earbuds now get inserted into your ear canal with that rubber piece? ok so my ear canals are so small they ALWAYS push the ear bud out, even with the ones you can adjust the size on. I just bought a pair rip-off apple ear buds cuz they dont go into your ear very far but even those are a little big, luckily they can sit in my ear on their own.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I feel this. I only use the Apple earphones because they fit my ears correctly >.<
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i have the same problem, even apple ones pop out of my ears
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): very annoying
Jess (whoozica): YEA ok thank you
Jess (whoozica): i was thinking i was some kind of weirdo
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): small ear crew
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The ones that go in my ears ALWAYS FALL OUT WHEN I LISTEN TO MUSIC
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I can’t work out without music and they fall out while I’m running and aaaaAAAAAHH
Jess (whoozica): toms always telling me the rubber ones are Elite™ and im like "not if they just fall out"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof call out XD jk
Erik (slendergiant): I use Skullcandy earbuds. They stay in for the most part except if I'm working out but that's from excessive motion and sweat
Erik (slendergiant): but I hate headphones because they give me headaches
Erik (slendergiant): #struggle
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the ones i find that work...ok are the ugly ones with the earband that kind of wrap around your ear? lmao
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I use Apple because Apple only works with Apple and the mic works with my phone. Any other time I have earphones with a mic where they aren’t Apple it doesn’t work.

Oh also sorry to change but I blocked that creepy dude that was reposting all my shit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GOOD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I said fuck it and did it
Jess (whoozica): oh good, i was starting to be lik 👀
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And reported his account cause all it is is reposting. 

I need to stop being nice to creepers.
Jess (whoozica): i feel you ~~i got a completely unsolicited dick pic yesterday~~ like ive never even talked to the prson
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I don’t care if t gives a person “credit” it really doesn’t. 

OH GOD GIRL WHATS HIS NUMBER ILL GIVE HIM HELL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): EW?? whos ass are we kicking??
Jess (whoozica): yea no that was creepy.

Hes from another country juding by his profile but i blocked him instantly
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh one of those™
Jess (whoozica): yeeeee exactly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YIKES
Jess (whoozica): im just glad its no one i actually knew cuz that would be even more awkward™
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~why would someone you associate with be that stupid~~
Jess (whoozica): i dont think they would 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~rephrase: why would you associate with them~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I got a lot of creepy messages on my Katheryne Knight profile on FB (not my page) 
I’m thinking of deleting it because I’m getting tired of the constant “hi” and “hey sexy” I’m getting
Jess (whoozica): ughhhh 🙄
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I have I’m in a relationship but doesn’t stop a lot of people
Erik (slendergiant): ugh, *men* 😒
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Men™
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Erik does get alot of unsolicited comments about his bellabooty*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Not normal guys. Men™
Erik (slendergiant): but in all seriousness I'm really sorry you guys have that shit to deal with :/
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna say it’s okay cause in the end the guys that do that are bottom feeders, but at the same time it’s not okay because it goes from being scary to hella annoying
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like take the fucking hint
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have yet to get any hey sexy or creepy messages... thank god but I did have a guy on my FB and deviant art a few years ago bugging me with his foot fetish thing >.< like ummmm...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): UMMMM GROSS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIKES HARDEST PASS
Evie (Katheryne Knight): MAJOR OOF
Jess (whoozica): OH GOSH NO
Erik (slendergiant): webbed toes, the gold mine of the foot fetish community
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD right??

No thanks byyyyeeee! He even creeped on my SO at the time too 0.o
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lmfao... I guess so Erik xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): holy CRAP
Jess (whoozica): thats terrifying D:
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I honk I put up with it for a year on deviantart and then when we found my Facebook page I was like umm no thanks byeee
Jess (whoozica): oh no yea that is not okay
Jess (whoozica): i mean none of it is ok
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So much nope
