Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I dont usually vent about coworkers but
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): For fucks sake 
How useless can you be
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof 
I feel this
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A big mood. I have that same feeling with some of my coworkers
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Like
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): You've worked here since october
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): And basically the only thing you've ever worked on is the pos for drive throug
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): HOW THE HELL DK YOU STILL NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS OR WHERE TO FIND ANYTHING
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I know for me i still don't know our system and riles and regulations to a tee at my job but like

Jesus
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I'm on the bar making drinks and have to go over and correct the way drinks are being rung up, or show her how to find them for basically every other car
Like it's not complicated 
Espresso drinks are under the espresso tab, teas are below teas 
Theres a tab that says syrup and if you hit it, you can find all the syrups
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay yeah I could learn that shit in a week
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like Nani
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Like I understand somethings are hard to find
And some businesses have really weird POS systems (looking at insomnia cookies. Like for real it's a cookie shop you dont need your POS to be so complicated)
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): But like 
Ours is very straight forward 
Drinks are organized by type on the bottom tab (brewed, espresso, blended, teas, other) 
And customizations are on the right in a similar way
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Also like it's been almost 2 months and this is almost the only thing she has worked with 
Youd think she'd be able to find where the big name drinks are without a problem
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Like I get it, the coconut mocha macchiato is hard to find and only 1 person orders it every now and then
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): But the caramel macchiatos that have there own line in the espresso page? That like at least 100 people order every day?
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Like come on
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that's annoying as fuck
Evie (Katheryne Knight): How much longer is your shift
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): FUCKIN ANGIE
