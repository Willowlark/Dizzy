Jamie (Jamie): Slight rage over talking with jasons mum about bringing my dog here to live (of which i have discussed plenty with Jason) a d her multiple times making suggestions of givign him to a rescue or assuming he is in anyway a violent dog because he has pit in him. Like fucking hell i get your worry for your damn allergies but fuck off trying to assume he is a mean dog
Jamie (Jamie): Also saying we should have him just live out in the pole barn and not inside. That doubled my fuck off energy
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wtf... Yo Mr. Miller is a big ole fucking love bug. He would never hurt a soul. He's only ever injured me cause he got excited jumping cause he wanted to give me *love*. I've never seen that dog be violent. Only wanting love, attention and to be close to someone
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And yea live out in a barn? What... that's so mean
Jamie (Jamie): And she didnt seem to get i was saying that is barely better than assholes that leave dog outside on chains and in cages.
Jamie (Jamie): Yea miller is the biggest baby of dog I have ever known. The main issue is gonna be if him and suki get along or not. Not is he gonna hurt anyone
Jamie (Jamie): If he hurts someone...i aint crying if its her. Not saying its right but my spitey side is not caring
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhm yea this is true. I don't see why eh wouldn't though. He didn't bother the cats soo.
Hopefully all is good and she stops being such a pain about it. I'd say as long as Jason is cool with it is all that should matter since it's his (and your) house
Anna (blonde and sad): ugh pit prejudice is fuckin bullshit.
Georgia (Something Sensible): tru my dad had one as a kid and said he was a lazy loving dog
Anna (blonde and sad): pits are just huge babies
Anna (blonde and sad): i hope he gets along with suki
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea my bro has a pit and she's such a baby. Always wanting to snuggle and give licks. It's his mastiff that needs to be worried about ~~that things the vicious one~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like pits or those with put in them arent vicious unless you make them be. With the right training they're big ole babies.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): People just aren't looking at the right pits when judging... they only see what they want
Jamie (Jamie): Yea pretty much miller to a T is a big baby who when gets over excited runs away and comes back holding his blankie in his mouth like...wow much scary
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeeepp ^
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He jumps sometimes and can cause injuries but he doesn't mean too. It's just cause he is super excited to see you. ~~plus I smol and he about a big as me so easily able to get tossled around by his love lol~~
Jamie (Jamie): Yea thats about his biggest threat is he wants to love and give hugs and when not prepared he is 80-90 lbs of said loving lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. Also why is Jason's mom having a say in this anyways? It's ya'lls house...
Jamie (Jamie): I know and yea she put money in it but she has her own damn side and seems to forget that the rest of the house is Jason's not hers
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh so she lives there with you guys??
Jamie (Jamie): God I give her respect and such because its his mom but if I didnt need to I would honestly just be like fuck off most of the time to her
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. I don't blame you. Ya'll adults. She needs to stay out of your business.. :\
Jamie (Jamie): Yea and i reiterate has her own side like full house with kitche. And full bath
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And ohh. Well that's good. I am assuming it's like... not connected? Or like is a duplex like set up?
Jamie (Jamie): Like its weird to complain about not having to clean but like she cleans and suddenly we know where nothing is anymore. One she constantly does is moving the shoes from where we put them and puts them in our rooms like no shoes go where shoes go damnit
Jamie (Jamie): No connected via a door that i think we should make a thicker door with a bolt on our side
Jamie (Jamie): But its his mum and he is hesitant to do it despite his own complaints
Jamie (Jamie): I swear if this thing we have doesnt work out and i leave it will be full blame to me being tired of her
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hopefully she doesn't bother ya'll too much. But yea like if ya'll have your own side... she shouldn't be sticking her nose in your business or what ya'll doing in your side of the house.  And oof yea that's nice she does that but can be problematic. My dad does the same when cleaning and it's super annoying... 
And oof well hopefully things can get settled out. Sounds like it's a bit of a pain with her at times. I agree... maybe figure something out to keep her and her opinions in her section of the house and keep her from overtaking you guys and how ya'll live. ANd aww well hopefully things stay working out. Ya'll seem great and happy. But yea >~< I don't blame ya. SO's parents can be a pain at times... I had my fair share of head butts in the past
Jamie (Jamie): Of i get full satisfaction when she tries to push her ideals of decor on our side and he quite literally says fuck off and puts dragons everywhere
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I guess she doesn't like Jason's decorating? lol
Jamie (Jamie): Its hilarious how much you can tell she doesnt like his style of decor and would rather it be more home and gardens in her opinion
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He's an adult woman. He helped pay for the place! Ain't your section of the house. He wants to do dragons let the man do dragons and shit.
And oh boy.
Jamie (Jamie): Yea just the home and gardens thing is a good idea on why my personality clashes with hers alot and her ideas
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel like the word home and gardens and Jason jsut greatly clashes LOL. Like him having a typical basic home with cute family sayings, flowrs and shit?? Pffftt XD
Jamie (Jamie): Oh god work feels like a sauna today. And its not even summer heat yet
Matt (mattmyers25): I made a mistake. I research flights to London and I can fly there for 500 bucks
Matt (mattmyers25): Why do I half to be poor
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Boy you got enough planned for this year. You don't need to be going to London lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am literally going to pull my hair out. I am so tired of my fucking parents right now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel like I am just being bitched at about everything anymore
