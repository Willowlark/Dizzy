Jamie (Jamie): Okay i genuinely hate working food service. Not even a pride thing far from it. I did it for so long and got out for a reason. Like both nights i fought tearing up so far cause its fucking me up so much mentally being back in it
Jamie (Jamie): It might be partial the night shift but i know i do not want to deal with the heavy crowds either of day shift
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Valid reason I hope the maid job happens instead cause bad work environment mentally isn't worth the money
