Rebecca (madameterralupus): Well we were to be in Nashville by now but flights been delayed cause some stewardess seat was loose by a door and they needed to fix it for our safety?? So we got boarded, taxi-ed our, realized it, came back and sat, had to board off and waiting to get on another plane... our flight was to leave at 6:30...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also the flight after us to FL got delayed to 12:30am...YiKeS
