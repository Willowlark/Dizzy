Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Plus wear and tear on car that will put you down the hole
Matt (mattmyers25): I'm suppose to be leaving at 2 today because the office is closed. My boss tells me I may not be getting out at 2
Matt (mattmyers25): And she dumps a shit ton of work on my desk at 1 to do
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh lovely...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Did she only tell that and do that to you?
Matt (mattmyers25): And she was out most of the morning
Matt (mattmyers25): And 3 other things. One is emailing 67 people individually invoices
Matt (mattmyers25): The girl who does it is off today
Matt (mattmyers25): I'm here until 230
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: Hey random dudes who both stared at my car and then leaned out the window to holler something at me, I can't hear you and now I'm paranoid there's something wrong with my vehicle
