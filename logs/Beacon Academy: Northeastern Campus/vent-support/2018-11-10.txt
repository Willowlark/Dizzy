Marisa (Weeb): oh no the dumb cosplay thing i ordered had a problem so they e-mailed me for clarification.
how do i make this e-mail sound as minimally awkward and as courteous as possible without being overly formal
they already know I can't be a native speaker by my name so if I just keigo back at them it can't be too bad right
Marisa (Weeb): i woke up early to make a detour before school but i just spent 90% of my time drafting that weird e-mail aertgrhrgfd i hope they got the info they wanted. it was just my phone number which they said had the wrong number of digits but there's never been an issue with it before? so i threw an extra 0 in the front, that sometimes helps.
Marisa (Weeb): And now I think my hot water heater is busted there’s a blinking light on it aaaaa
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah there’s no hot water hdjdicgan good thing I did dishes last night
Jess (whoozica): Oooo nooo <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Weeb): I’m hoping this is a building problem and not a me problem because if it’s the latter I’ll spend the next three months with no hot water <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Jess (whoozica): Mawisa nooooøø
Marisa (Weeb): Cosplay company dude got back to me that my phone number is fine now so at least I can cosplay <:lenny:456549338026344489> 
I tried googling the water heater issue and everything said “call the gas company they’ll fix it.” If nothing changes by Monday I guess I’ll try contacting the company in charge of my apartment.
Jess (whoozica): Can't you contact the landlord?
Marisa (Weeb): That’d be the company I rent through, probably. I don’t know the landlord but I know the person in charge of us renters
Jess (whoozica): Call Dem!
Marisa (Weeb): And the train is packed like sardines wow today is great
It’s the weekend so nothing can be done ;u; everything important closes even hospitals close on the weekends
Jess (whoozica): Nuuuuuu! 😭
Jess (whoozica): Are you gonna be ok?
Marisa (Weeb): <:rip:378273525804433408>
Marisa (Weeb): Oh this next train is much better
Marisa (Weeb): Cold showers are so cold this is like jewish camp in the mountains all over again
Marisa (Weeb): except I’m not hitchhiking at 1am yet
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I hope you get your hot water fixed soon 😱
Marisa (Weeb): thank 😱  knowing me it'll never come back on if it's a personal issue that doesn't affect the whole building <:lenny:456549338026344489>
