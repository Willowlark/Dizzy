Georgia (Something Sensible): But the closet is for the gays :V
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestly she may even think itâ€™s gross to be gay idk
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sheâ€™s pretty damn conservative
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ugh Idk how youâ€™re standing this 
But you are
Hang in there girl
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): She the invincible girl.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~But bitch needs a reality check and who better than tournament champion of mistral~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestly between physics and the gym and friends, Iâ€™m not at the dorm often
Georgia (Something Sensible): Plus the other suitemates are on my side
Georgia (Something Sensible): They just didnâ€™t have this problem with Sarah last year cause her roommate was never there
Georgia (Something Sensible): She was a party girl that slept in other peoples dorms
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): As long as you are able to live your college life, okay. But go to bat if sheâ€™s ruining your day consistently.
Matt (mattmyers25): Sounds like Sarah needs to get the stick out of her ass and realize the world doesn't revolve around her
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah Iâ€™ll probably bring it up
Georgia (Something Sensible): If I sit on the fact that it annoys me itâ€™s only gonna get worse
Matt (mattmyers25): Hope the meeting goes well tonight and you get the results you want
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!245270932602486784> my friend shared these on her instastory.... i think your roommate needs these ðŸ˜‚ knocks two things out at once lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): OOOO NICU
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey does anyone know how to connect your FB page to insta? I logged back onto Facebook, and now I canâ€™t get t to connect to my page. Just my profile
Erik (slendergiant): I think you might need a business account to link to a page
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Iâ€™ve never had to do that before
Evie (Katheryne Knight): O.o
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I think you have to go to insta and click on open facebook?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Thanks how I get from insta to facebook
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 
Erik (slendergiant): Oh wait yeah you can. Go to linked accounts and link Facebook. Tap on it and it should let you select where to share it on Facebook
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof how do o get to linked accounts again?
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): 
Erik (slendergiant): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): FAK IM JUST DUMB IGNORE ME
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thank
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Tells you how often I did it
Erik (slendergiant): So low key, work has been very dull for me. Like, I don't really have any important pressing projects to work on at the moment? Mostly just have a decent amount of documents to update but they're not really hot at the moment. Right now I'm trying to declutter my desk and I'm finally getting around to filing a shit ton of purchase orders I forgot to file when I was taking care of that while our customer service person was out on vacation... back in June...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): dull can be as bad as busy...
Jess (whoozica): i feel you, my job is either super busy or super not busy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Iâ€™ve been hella stressed at my job. I donâ€™t like working here anymore. The only people who kept the workplace fresh left, and the new person doesnâ€™t like to help on the teller side. So Iâ€™m by myself today because my other co-worker is at an all day training.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And just everyone is kinda miserable
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): id rather be busy than bored all day, the boredom of my job is what kills me too
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh no
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Only issue is Iâ€™ve only had the job for 6 months so I donâ€™t want to go leaving t already 

But through this job Iâ€™m realizing that while Iâ€™m good at customer service, itâ€™s beginning to put a lot of strain on me
Erik (slendergiant): The boredom is definitely taking a toll. Like, as much as I hate this company, I still feel guilty for basically getting paid to fuck around on my computer all day?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That, but then you have to justify every hour of the day as billable to the client or non billable.
Erik (slendergiant): Like yesterday after lunch I basically spent the rest of the day designing those business cards
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah that's even worse for you
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I've gotten rather good at being good and descriptive to make sure my days look busy.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Cause billable good, non billable bad.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Just laid out a plan for the last quarter though, and there's some concrete (finally) work items in there.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So when people aren't pinging me with random requests (like, over 50% of my day to day) I have something to fall back on.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I honestly wish I could be on the computer all day but they donâ€™t let tellers have access to anything at my job.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like Iâ€™m on my phone, but I canâ€™t update my website or do anything on it
Jess (whoozica): yea i bs alot of my day, for example, right now im looking at real estate listing for no reason
Georgia (Something Sensible): Tales of my roommate continue: she came back from breakfast and put this MEGA big mango on the windowsill
Jess (whoozica): take it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Push it out the window.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Iâ€™m so tempted to write owo on it
Georgia (Something Sensible): SO tempted
Erik (slendergiant): MangOwO
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Fucking DO IT
Erik (slendergiant): Or...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Tell her your allergic to it or it's blocking your view xD see how she reacts
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Get her one of these.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Omg thats it
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Tell her your allergic. 
She throws it out
Open back pack
Eat mango
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Georgia have you given her a snickers yet
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg I havenâ€™t
Georgia (Something Sensible): Thatâ€™s so passive aggressive tho I love it lmao
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *bows*
Erik (slendergiant): https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cf/84/3f/cf843f00c15ef9f2117a69a0c726f827.jpg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HOLY sHIT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Jess (whoozica): lmaooooo
Georgia (Something Sensible): Her mom was over yesterday and honestly that was the shortest angriest lady
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
YEET HER OUT OF THERE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oooooof
Fuuuuuuck that
Georgia (Something Sensible): O man the kid in front of me smells so bad Iâ€™m getting real nauseous
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ðŸ’©
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like Iâ€™m tryna hide my nose in my flannel ðŸ˜‚
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Good luck girly.
Georgia (Something Sensible): College bois..........plz
Georgia (Something Sensible): This is worse than con funk
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Never understood how people could not shower daily.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Does it smell like poop or pee because I had a kid like that in high school
Georgia (Something Sensible): Just like.... sour
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ugh
Yeah they need to shower
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sour sweat ewww
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like if they are justcomong from the gym I get it but like...other than that fucking clean yourself
Erik (slendergiant): I'd rather be late to class than skip showering in the morning
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wish others felt the same as you Erik lmao
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~Iâ€™d skip class rather than leave the dorm without one~~
Erik (slendergiant): Like once I accidentally overslept and woke up 10 minutes before class and I still managed to shower and get to class on time
Jess (whoozica): might be their clothes too, if you leave your clothes in the washer too long after they're done they can get a sour smell
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): WOW, not only is a stink bomb in class; heâ€™s one of those assholes who leaves his clothes in the community washer for hours.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ugh
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Next he'll kick puppies for fun.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I ran outside for fresh air and Iâ€™ve never been happier to smell a college campus
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh man.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): There were these trees at Rowan that bloomed in the spring.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): They lined the road through the campus, and most people had to walk past them at some point during the day.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~They smelled like jizz.~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I never understood why Rowan didn't cut them down, it was kinda gross.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ohhhhh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theres a church near my apartment that has a TON of those trees
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OKAY MY STIPID COLLEGE OLANETED TREES LILE THAY TOO WHERE I LIVED
Evie (Katheryne Knight): THEY SMELL LIKE SEWAGE AND I HATE IT
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Seriously, who decides to plant a tree like that? ðŸ˜†
Jess (whoozica): wonder what they are called
Erik (slendergiant): Is it these? https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1491579534415-4534256493_e442928981_b.jpeg?resize=800:*
Erik (slendergiant): https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qk97b3/trees-smell-like-vomit-jizz-barf-semen-spring
Jess (whoozica): LMAO THAT TITLE
Erik (slendergiant): RIGHT?
Erik (slendergiant): I Googled "smelly trees on college campuses" and that's what came up
Jess (whoozica): do it grow pears?
Jess (whoozica): they probably dont cost much and colleges are like "het these are pretty, order a fuckton"
Erik (slendergiant): They're apparently an invasive species
Jess (whoozica): of course
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Invasive to my nostrils.
Jess (whoozica): surprised i dont have any in my yard, the previous owners planted so many invasive things
