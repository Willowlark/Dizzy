Anna [Cyborg]: o shit its arda? I wanna see if my recovery skills are still good. 
Gimme gimme its worth a try
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): if its too damaged you could also cut it short for vol 7 blake
Anna [Cyborg]: ~~judging by those raven pics it might barely be salvageable for a mens wig but i wanna try a new method of wig recovery~~
Anna [Cyborg]: specifically for smoothing hella friz and for untangling knots.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I got one of the other many wigs already cut for Vol 7 Blake ðŸ‘Œ This ones pretty bad. Ill bring it next time I see ya Anna. You can do whatever with it. Tes ya magic lol.
Anna [Cyborg]: yeet. Imma see if i cant get one of these bad bois to help. i feel it might help fix super ruined wigs. https://www.amazon.com/Annie-Straightening-Comb-Teeth-Copper/dp/B008LEOHYC/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=hot%2Bcombs%2Bfine%2Bteeth&qid=1562776774&s=gateway&sr=8-4&th=1
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh ðŸ˜®
Anna [Cyborg]: ye cause like? i repair my frizz ends via straightener and a comb but i only have 2 hands so why not combine the two?
Anna [Cyborg]: if it works it might be a game changer for me
Anna [Cyborg]: Hi i wanna die this project im on? 
they want us to be in a GoTo meeting. every morning
Anna [Cyborg]: every. single. morning.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's normal.
Anna [Cyborg]: ehhhhhh not for these guys apparently
also like its supposed to be like someone from every industry on the project so idk how this is even gonna work
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): *It's not*
Anna [Cyborg]: coordination meetings my ass more like let the HVAC and plumbing and sheetmetal guys duke it out
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The official IBM term is 'going down the rabbit hole'.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Two people on a call of two dozen having a detailed discussion about something irrelevant to the rest of the call which makes everyone one else zone out.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Then nothing gets done and the 'everyone gives a 1 minute update' meeting that's supposed to be 15 minutes takes 45.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Thankfully I left that project in the new year, and my new project is smaller so everyone's in the loop ~~and they know to leave me alone on my work~~.
Anna [Cyborg]: that sounds like a blissful result
at least theres one guy conducting it all
