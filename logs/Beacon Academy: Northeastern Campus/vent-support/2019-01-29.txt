Jamie (Jamie): Okay i want to pipe up quick cause though i understand the reasons people got upset over the recent community drama involving snowthesaltqueen (and saying nothing on theyre person just the situation) but i would like to point out there was an actual convo in this discord wanting to take photos i think it was of strq in a graveyard to be the dead summer thing. And no it is not different just because the dangan had booty out a little bit. Also not the first time it been done Look through goth photoshoots and enjoy. 
Thanks for coming to my ted talk. Words for thought.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea it's absolutely fine to take pictures in a graveyard. You just have to be respectful and careful. Her taking pictures in the graveyard is not what people are stressing about. It's how she seemed to go about it and is reacting comments on it ~~Idk the full thing, that's just what I've read and seen at least. There could be other drama around it. But idk and idc cause oof too much for me XD~~

> He messages me an issue, I tell him my best guess and how to check if I'm right
> He messages me again, ignoring the instructions and trying to reexplain the problem like I didn't understand
> *Assuming he's intelligent*, I tell him I have no other answers for him, he has to debug himself.
> *M e s s a g e s me again*, to once again explain the *same* problem and asks for a conference call to discuss.
> ...
> Fine. It's my job.
> Get on call.
> He SHOWS me the problem.
> I ask if he did the first thing I told him to do.
> He shows me that he did something else entirely instead cause he wasn't paying attention.
