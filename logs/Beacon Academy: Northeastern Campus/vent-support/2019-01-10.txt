Rebecca (madameterralupus): So this person I'm kinda friends with/mutuals with on instagram dm'ed me about the hot dog Snapchat filter I threw up on my close friends list story (I have her on there cause we chat from time to time and have followed each other a while.) but she's like if this is the kind of content I'm to expect on close friends, please take me off. And then was like it's fine but this is so cursed... 
I'm just like are you upset, offended or something by a stupid Snapchat filter that you want removed from that list? I'm so confused...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sounds like a weirdo.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like she sounded upset/offended in the first message but now seems like she was just joking. I'm just like...??? What...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): People are weird on insta
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Indeed. Now I'm just here like do I remove her from close friends..??  🤷🏻‍♀️
Georgia (Something Sensible): Do it cause she’s weird
Georgia (Something Sensible): Weird people don’t need to be on close friends lol
Anna (Cadmium): i finally got an appointment for the fluffy boi

Jess (whoozica): 😦 at least youll be able to finally find out whats wrong and hopefully get some help for him
Anna (Cadmium): i hope so. im also sick of having to wash stuff he's peed on (how does one cat hold that much liquid. how. )
ZombieHunter: Today in Chinese food
ZombieHunter: Someone stole a credit card and ordered food with us. 
For delivery 
The cop came before that could happen 
We sent the cop to the delivery address. 😂😂😂
Jess (whoozica): give the food to the cop instead
ZombieHunter: Right
ZombieHunter: Only thing satisfying is how stupid that was. Crime with an address for the culprit.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Lmaoooo

Anna (Cadmium): AAAAAAAAAAAAAA HOLY CRAP
I am so pissed rn
we got a survey and ive been doing all this work assuming the fucking elevations they gave us were like. relatively close too reality. 
~~There appears to be a 74' difference between their assumed datum and reality.~~
Anna (Cadmium): and they DIDNT MARK THE REFERENCE POINT
Anna (Cadmium): SO WE HAVE NO GODDAMN IDEA
Jess (whoozica): 74'?!
Anna (Cadmium): INDEED.
Jess (whoozica): HOW DID THIS HAPPEN
Anna (Cadmium): *we were supposed to have 75% submission by tomorrow*
Anna (Cadmium): *and the fucking surveyor isnt answering*
Anna (Cadmium): *and the fucking county sewer data is the as-built from '86 so its not even in current datum*
Jess (whoozica): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Anna (Cadmium): oh no my cosplay partner messaged me saying she might not be able to make it to katsu
Anna (Cadmium): *BRUH IM STAYING AT YOUR HOUSE FOR KATSU*
