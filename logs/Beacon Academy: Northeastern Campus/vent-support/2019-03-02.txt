Jamie (Jamie): fucking RT site still pisses me off not letting me be able to login via computer like password reset link never actual send and i have yet to hear back from my direct email to the account support email its a whole lot of BS
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Why dont you just connect it to your Facebook
Jamie (Jamie): at least my phone account randomly is reconnected so i can watch stuff if i want with my first
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: And log in with that?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: You can connect your Facebook through the RT app too 
Cause that's what I did when I had log in problems
Jamie (Jamie): cause my account is paying for the one im paying for ~~and i dont feel like dealing with doing new payment and figuring out how to cancel the old
Jamie (Jamie): i might about to feel annoyed af cause of the email showing up when i went to checkout in the store via my phone
Jamie (Jamie): its not the email that should be connected to the account basically lol 🙃 👺
Jamie (Jamie): yea im def shutting it down stopping payments and such and redo it all cause i just wanted access to the 5% discount and site and app are being dicks about my being logged in
Jamie (Jamie): like the app has me signed into first so went to store via app to get the 5% off get to check out says need to log in and i can't use the discount
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thanks guys

It's rough because I haven't dealt with a death like this in years and there is a lot to unpack here on top of that

Thank you for the support ❤️
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Everything you're feeling is valid dw we're here for you. ❤️
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Social anxiety is: hiding when your neighbor knocks you door. ~~ I didn't feel like socializing okay...~~
Jess (whoozica): OH that happened to is this morning! Some kids knocked on our door to ask to shovel and we hid
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Idk what he wanted and I don't care. Leave me alonnneee. Plus he'll keep chatting to me forever...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://youtu.be/9hv0M4mnrE8
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Relevant comedy bit because it's accurate AF
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol 100% me. I fucking hid in the corner until he left. He even went to the backdoor?! Like excuse me sir. Leave me alone, come back later or another day. I had enough socializing for the day XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lmao also a sword is relatable. I've done that before tbh o.o~~
Marisa (Mawisa): He went to the back door??
Maybe something was wrong but in that case he shoulda left a note
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea cause I saw him coming back up the driveway and my dog went to bark.
And lol who knows. Usually he wants to discuss stupid stuff
