Rebecca (madameterralupus): .... I already know where this is gonna go... and just *no thanks*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I *KNOW*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Insurance salesmen are the worst these days. 😛
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hi beautiful
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me name is gerog
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao Georgia XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): 😉
Rebecca (madameterralupus): High key tempted to accept it and respond with just simply *hard pass* XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): SEND THE YIKES HARD PASS PICTURE
Matt (mattmyers25): Its a trap
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am extremely tempted now XD
Jess (whoozica): OMG I have to show you guys this screenshot my friend sent me from dating app she uses
Jess (whoozica): 
Erik (slendergiant): That was the proper way to respond
Rebecca (madameterralupus): People on tinder are extremely weird XD
I was using it for a bit after my break up to see what types of people are out there. Like 99% are so fucking weird XD I only found 1 decent person (who I am friends with now)... but like yo oof... people are *WEIRD*. Like just nope... *yikes hard pass* 😂
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): What I learned is that tinder is good for nothing but awkward conversations and bad dates
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:valid:420824413592748032>
Georgia (Something Sensible): and memes?
Erik (slendergiant): My sister just got engaged and they met on Tinder ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Tbh tinder is not good for people like me who take things slow, and is pretty picky XD I matched with people but never met up with them except one and rarely chatted... cause even though i matched they all were still big nopes XDD
I was mostly on there to experiment and see what type of fish are in the sea and it was just wayy to over whelming when people were like wanna meet up? XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:valid:420824413592748032> I have heard a lot of people met on tinder, and get married. Those are the lucky people. They found the good ones out of the millions of bad XDD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): For ppl who are open and easily connect with ppl the app is great. But I can’t connect well with ppl unless I already have an established friendship with them so for me the app was hopeless 😅
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^^ AGREED
Georgia (Something Sensible): alternatives to tinder, standing on a box in a crowded place and just yelling "who wants to go on a date"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XDDD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ^^^^^ THAT
Jess (whoozica): Yea, it works for some people for sure. I don't have any personal experience with them but yea I don't think it'd work for me
Erik (slendergiant): And then a bunch of guys also stand on boxes and whip their junk out in reply
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ditto to Meg. Can’t imagine dating anyone I’m not already friends with.
Jess (whoozica): So true erik
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah, the friendship has to be established for me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean the one guy I am friends with now I debated on trying to go out with  a while back but Matt says I can't date him 😂 Also not really that into him lol. 
And mhmm agreed. I feel like friending them before dating helps a lot cause you get to know them better, as well as your friends.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I believe I saw that bumble is the most popular dating app right now. The one where women make the first move.
Georgia (Something Sensible): a lot of people are that way with the friendships thing
Erik (slendergiant): That's what I was using
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You grow into the romantic feelings as you become better friends.
Jess (whoozica): Honestly if some dude was like "let's meet up" I'd be like sure I'll bring 10 of my closest friends and. Tazer cuz I'm paranoid af
Erik (slendergiant): Mostly for the hell of it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^^ Honestly me.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~you mean im not supposed to bring BNE with me?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You *could*.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol honestly me Jess. I went on a "date" (kinda) and I had let Matt know beforehand just to be safe since was near his area XDD
Jess (whoozica): Yea for sure, gotta be safe 👌
Georgia (Something Sensible): /puts wigs on friends "ok now hide here and look casual and spy on the date"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Never tried the app world really. Made an account once, but I didn’t like the whole “pick and choose who you like”. Not a video game.
Erik (slendergiant): This is my profile. Not sure how I'm not getting matches 🤷🏻‍♂️
Matt (mattmyers25): YOU CANT DATE MOODY. HE IS MY DOCS SON. I FORBIT IT
Matt (mattmyers25): YOU CANT DATE MOODY. HE IS MY DOCS SON. I FORBIT IT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMFAO MATT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mood.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): (Y)
Jess (whoozica): This is da bumbl Erik?
Erik (slendergiant): Ye
Georgia (Something Sensible): wow eriks thats an awesome profile
Georgia (Something Sensible): why havent you gotten more matches lol
Jess (whoozica): Yea I think so too 👌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This just in: You can't date me unless brother approves XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): you got that nerdy fun aesthetic but because youre an engineer women know you can be serious
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *apparently*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I cant stop laughing because your crotch is so huge in the top bar
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LMFAO
Jess (whoozica): NICE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Swipe (whichever direction you swipe for yes)
Georgia (Something Sensible): you WANNA TRY WORDING THAT AGAIN 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): NO<:lenny:456549338026344489>
Matt (mattmyers25): Didn't notice that and now I do
Erik (slendergiant): *NORMALLY* it looks like this, but I had to scroll down to show my actual profile blerb
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Erik: *I knew. And I made sure to leave it there too. <:lenny:456549338026344489>*
Georgia (Something Sensible): wait so do the women make profiles too tho
Erik (slendergiant): Yeah
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ERIK THAT IS A GOOD ASS PIC OF YOU
Georgia (Something Sensible): ive always wanted the experience of making a tinder but i dont wanna use it,
Erik (slendergiant): THANKS, BILLIAM TOOK IT
Matt (mattmyers25): Dont do it, its a trap
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): SNAPS FOR BILLIAM
Georgia (Something Sensible): OMG _is that a sonic screwdriver in your pocket or are you just happy to-- oh no you actually... oh ok
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee cause this is mine. I redownloaded to pull what bullshit I had up 😂
How does one profile?!
Erik (slendergiant): But yeah Bumble is basically Tinder but women make the first move
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You did say you want to use one of the Galaxy sweatshirt photos for a tinder. 🤣
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have such good photos for a tinder because billiam is the best
Georgia (Something Sensible): WASTED POTENTIAL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~I'm the odd one out here, I used tinder for awhile and I liked talking and meeting people xD it's not thhhhaaat bad~~
Erik (slendergiant): So you shook m can't get unsolicited dick pics unless you talk to them first
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have no problem with you wasting that potential.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lets see if people are still weird on these apps or not. Even though I know the answer is yes~~
Jess (whoozica): Real odd one out here. Never use done at all <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Honestly I gave up on using tinder for dating and making friends XDD I.e. the one I have now lmfao
Georgia (Something Sensible): make tom make a tinder just so you can swipe right and get the real deal
Georgia (Something Sensible): then promptly delete to avoid the peen
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): See I’m just never actually interested in ppl, dating isn’t my thing and I’ve never been good at it. Can’t we just be friends ~~that’s sometimes fuck but whatever~~
Jess (whoozica): I make both of us profiles and swipe right on each other
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > swipes right on Tom
> lowers phone
> Tom
> jump on Tom
> <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Erik (slendergiant): https://youtu.be/8E4WrtMuPWo
Erik (slendergiant): While we're on the subject...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Bumble makes sense. Kinda takes the douchebag factor out.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There’s a trend with some where they suggest you friends of friends on Facebook.
Jess (whoozica): If anyone makes a dating profile you should let me help cuz I'll never get the experience otherwise
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s confusing to me.
Georgia (Something Sensible): dating is fun cause you always have someone to take to eat places
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~but also screw thats true~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): but also talk about feelings!
Georgia (Something Sensible): I SECOND WHAT JESS SAID
Georgia (Something Sensible): were making a tinder creation committee
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): But like I can do that with friends and **NOT** have to talk about feelings with 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): o see talking about feelings is fun
Georgia (Something Sensible): i like hearing how other people experience the world
Jess (whoozica): YEA
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): NOT FOR ME
Georgia (Something Sensible): FEELINGS ARE FUN NOT SCARY I SWEAR
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): WHAT ARE FEELINGS
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I don’t have those
Jess (whoozica): Meg nooooo come talk about feelings ♥️
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): *promptly runs in opposite direction*
Georgia (Something Sensible): jess ill talk about feelings with you <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>

Jess (whoozica): YEA

Georgia (Something Sensible): happiness is still a feeling <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Lust is a feeling too~~

Georgia (Something Sensible): we've soiled the meg name
Georgia (Something Sensible): reverse motivation sounds better
Georgia (Something Sensible): speaking of soiled names, at least 5 people have tagged me in flannel posts today and my weak ass didnt wear one cause it was too warm

On fridays I run a series of batch data uploads/processes/training. It's usually me running 5 commands in a row, which take 2~4 hours and I don't have to do shit during that time.

HOWEVER one of the services we use APPARENTLY completely changed their API last weekend which means our software can NO LONGER COMMUNICATE with it.There was an email sent to the team about this, telling them how to migrate over to the NEW API.

But did we do that *during the week? NOOOOOO.* We don't tell anyone who can do the migration it even *NEEDS TO BE DONE* until I'm in the middle of doing the weekly upload and *it stops working.*
Jess (whoozica): OOF
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YOU FUCKING
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WHO ANSWERS A QUESTION THAT IS EITHER 'this option, or that option' WITH
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ***THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER***
