Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Tom (tomukuncosplay): send a knowing lenny to them
Tom (tomukuncosplay): follow back is a good idea xD
Tom (tomukuncosplay): that'd be amusing
Georgia (Something Sensible): I could harness the power of 4K followers to just spam them with shit
Georgia (Something Sensible): _infinite possibilities_
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nothing malignant of course, they’re probably like 10, but damn it would be funny to spam all their photos with like poop emojis
Jess (whoozica): "wow you look really familiar" 🤔
