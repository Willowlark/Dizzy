meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Mild kiribaku rant incoming because I haven’t yelled about them recently and I have a lot of feelings. I’ve never been the one to find solace in a character before but by god do kirishima and bakugou make me happy. Yes I know they’re fictional characters and yes I know that they’re relationship isn’t cannon and will most likely never be cannon but they mean the fucking world to me. There friendship is more then just a title, they literally balance one another- yin and yang style. Kirishima brings katsuki’s inflated head down to size, keeps him in check and most importantly taught him it’s ok to be human. Where as bakugou builds kirishima up and is the literal blinding light that allows him to fight off his demons. They are the product of what happens when an unstoppable force meets an unbreakable object. Idgf that’ll they’ll never been canonically together, but you have to actually be blind to think that either of them would have accomplished HALF of what they have become without the other. Bakugou has had so much character development throughout the manga, and do to the influence of his teachers and the rest of class 1-A he prob would have *eventually* come to those changes over time anyway- but kirishima has been THE driving force behind him encouraging him along the way. And bakugous words of encouragement were literally THE motivating factor that lead to kirishima being able to unlock “unbreakable”. Idk where I was really going with this, I’ve just been having a rough week and been thinking about these losers a lot. I just love bakugou and kirishima and tbh I’m not even mad at Horikoshi about all the god damn queer baiting. Thanks for coming to my ted talk, merry Christmas
ZombieHunter: Me with bees.
Marisa (Mawisa): Sounds like the title of an autobiography
