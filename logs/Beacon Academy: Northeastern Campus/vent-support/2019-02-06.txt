Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I still don't have my sched for next week buuutt my one coworker said that if I got scheduled and she's not working one of those days she'd pick it up for me T_T Bless her!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): speaking of the unpopular opinions that show up in RWBY facebook groups...
Anna (loud and likely blonde): someone make a 'keep the decision to fire vic mignogna from rooster teeth' petition
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Y I k e s
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Speaking of he did a Livestream the other day. Basically a pity party
Matt (mattmyers25): I feel bad for vic's family. Like his wife and kids.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He has a wife?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I thought he was like... Divorced multiple times
Rebecca (madameterralupus): SO. Idk if they are married but he's been with a woman for years
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think they are at least engaged
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh I didn't know that
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yikes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): last I recall
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I dont think he has kids though
Marisa (Mawisa): ye i don't think they have kids
he is (or was?) married to an actress at one point
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I mean she might have had suspicions and like. been unable to do anything
Matt (mattmyers25): But still, she is a victim. She may of not really of know of everything else going on, but now she may be caught up in all of this
Weird I thought he had kids.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee. I've seen and I think met her (?) but don't recall her name
Marisa (Mawisa): Michele Specht
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes HER
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I was looking it up. We found it at the same time XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wow shes good looking
Marisa (Mawisa): she was on star trek
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea she was in the Star Trek series he did with Todd
Matt (mattmyers25): Always remember, when cases like this show up, there are victims on both sides of the coin. We can lash out against he accuser, but never bash the whole family. They may not of been aware of what's going on. Wait,until it becomes clear if they had knowledge of events before lashing out
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ Valid
Marisa (Mawisa): im just curious why this is getting big now. all of this has been known about vic and public info for 10+ years, but companies are only taking serious action now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Same. Like I've heard accusations for years of how he acted with fans, staff, etc...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wonder what made the scale finally tip and have everything errupt?
Marisa (Mawisa): ^
Marisa (Mawisa): ANN did a pretty good writeup on the topic, and aside from "it blew up on twitter" there's no other reason it seems. but it's blown up on social media before and gotten no reaction.
Marisa (Mawisa): https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2019-01-30/far-from-perfect-fans-recount-unwanted-affection-from-voice-actor-vic-mignogna/.142212
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Cause he was Broly in the DBZ movie I think that's why it blew the fuck up now. And with the Me Too movement being strong now, victims now a ctually have a platform to speak on. 

His time was coming.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also the fact that other VAs started coming about about him too
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^^
Marisa (Mawisa): o yeah the movie was definitely a catalyst that got conversation going
other VAs have been talking down on him for years, he's always bashed at otakon's voice actors after dark
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah but now with Me Too being huge they can actually be open on social media as well
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Not sure what the movies got to do with it but yeaa with the me too movement it helps bring stuff out more in discussion of the world
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like more so than ever
Marisa (Mawisa): i think it was just people getting together and talking like "hey vic is in this movie. remember what a creep he is?" and then people in the theater overhearing and going "hey yeah we've seen him be creepy too!" and it just grew
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly I'm glad he's finally getting his.just due. I like the stuff he voices buy I hate him as a person.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Got to meet him twice. It was at least something I can cross off my bucket list now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Gotta repaint my sword though XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Some people's  NDE s probably expired or they left the company and saw people talking and probs figured now is the time to speak up
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Plus all the ppl he was creeps to that didnt think of it at the time are old enough to speak up
Marisa (Mawisa): yeah at a convention it can be easy to get carried away and not realize what's happening. a lot of times when he'd be creepy towards someone in public, people would cheer.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes. When you're 13-14 sometimes you don't know any better. He wasn't too touvhy with me (probably cause I was dressed as Winter and taller than him in heels so I was radiating some Big Dick Energy. Also Chris was right there.)  but I know he's been creepy to some friends of mine.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i saw him briefly. but. any emotion i might have had was just radiating disgust at his fashion choices
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof where is the lie
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Then again my fashion choices will probably be the same when I'm his age. I'll stop giving a fuck XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh no
Anna (loud and likely blonde): his pants
Marisa (Mawisa): were they leather pants
Marisa (Mawisa): have you seen the leather pants video
Anna (loud and likely blonde): no they were worse
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *yes ive seen leather pants do you think im that out of touch*
Marisa (Mawisa): ok phew i had to make sure
Marisa (Mawisa): i worry
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok but vic's pants. wer like. lavender dip dyed acid wash denim bellbottoms
Anna (loud and likely blonde): with cross lacing all the way up the side
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like they were actually so ugly idt the 2000's wanted them back
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *oh and they were lo rise*
Matt (mattmyers25): I saw a post about never forget what he did, but I see a problem where people's feeds are crowded with the posts about this, and then they just get tired of seeing it. Like beating a dead horse. We should never forget what he has done, but we dont need to overkill it. Why do you think get tired of certain news stories or events?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee he did wrong and he needed called out for it, don't forget what he did was wrong buuutt my feeds the past several days have been flooded with talk about this.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need other news. Unless something new on this story comes about they are mostly repeating the same thing. I think I've seen  like 5 or more articles on how RT fired him
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I still want Quinton Flynn to voice Qrow now XD
Matt (mattmyers25): But what about chris?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ive never heard of this person until you mentioned him Evie lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The voice of Axel from KH. Got it memorized? Owo
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also Raiden from Metal Gear Rising
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Of Chris can't get it Quinton Flynn is the next best bet
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohhh I'll have to look him up. I don't recognize the voices enough to tell off memory lol
Marisa (Mawisa): There are loud noises from next door like they’re tearing down walls and I’m scared ;u;
What if they damage our house or someone knocks a hole into our wall
Mark (Mad Doctor): Fuck depression. In the ER with Audrey right now after a mental health crisis in school today. Always unpleasant to see her go through this. She's even more upset by the prospect of losing a day of Katsu if she has to go into a partial hospitalization program.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh no! ☹️ I hope everything is and will be okay 💕
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sending good vibes and positive thoughts! Let us know if we can do anything to help!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm sending positive vibes and hugs your way. 💓💓💓💓💓
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh no! I hope she feels better, my heart goes out to her!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thanks all. She's committed to healing, and that's a great sign.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 😢 my heart goes out to her. School is always the worst place for those too. Let us know if there's anything we can do
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Let her know I can’t wait to shoot her Mipha and see her at Katsu.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Anyone else's day dragging on forever? I feel like I've been here for like 12 hours

Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm going to try and get the lining done on Summers cape
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thank God I didn't pick lining material of this would be hella frustrating
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wanna start packing too but feel it's too early also don't feel like having suitcase sit in my hallway for over a week 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh i started packing two weeks ago
Georgia (Something Sensible): _just to feel like i was getting things done_
Georgia (Something Sensible): wow thermal physics cant be that bad
Georgia (Something Sensible): > 11 problem sets, when most classes have 6 that take 25 mins each
