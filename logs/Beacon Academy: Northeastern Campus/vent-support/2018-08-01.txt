Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Day 3 of this journey
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Monday went to battery warehouse to get it checked out and charged they took it from me and gave me a loaner went to work had to tape trash bags to windows cause it rained cause all the electrical is out. Tuesday took it to pep boys wasted time  and money for them to run a diagnosis and stop half way to fix a fuse that blew out later on my way to work which almost made me crash so this morning took it to pep boys again and wasted more time but they cant find the problem got back my money now it's at the ford dealership as an emergency service so now I wait and my manager let me borrow her car for  3 hrs so I can drive home shower and see my grandparents and cat and grab clothes cause I'm 15 mins away and David has been letting me stay at his house since Sunday and I feel so exhausted and frustrated from this all hopefully its better
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Aww well that's nice that David is letting you stay with him for so long. I hope ya get this figured out soon. I will deff say don't take it to Pep Boys they never seem to know what they are doing lol. Let's hope that now that it's at the dealerships shop they figure it out and get it fix ❤
