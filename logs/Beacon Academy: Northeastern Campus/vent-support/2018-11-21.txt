Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I'm trying to prep for my interview tomorrow and the more I'm looking through their website, the more I'm regretting scheduling this interview...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, the website is kind of a mess which gives a really bad impression about what the rest of the company must be like because our company is the same way
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *the copyright on this company's website says 2015 omg*
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oooooh noooo thatâ€™s not good vibes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So tomorrow shall be interesting
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If you donâ€™t like the looks of it, you donâ€™t have to accept. Youâ€™ll get interview exp, and if you get an offer you can use that to estimate how much money you should be asking for.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): #truefacts
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <@!386874959009415170> slay dat intaview. You have a daughter to support!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thanks!
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm just chilling in an empty parking lot in the same business park lol
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I've done that. Better to be heckin early after all.
Marisa (Weeb): don't think about penguins
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok well... may or may not have made a dumb decision
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He called me back already offering the position
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I declined
Matt (mattmyers25): If you didn't feel right about the company or job then declining was a good move
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Did you get the amount he was offering? Just for comparisons sake?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): And Matt's right, you didn't feel right about it, so don't accept. Simple.
Jess (whoozica): if you weren't feelin' it you weren't feelin' it mah dude
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I gave my salary requirements which was 10k more than I currently make and he offered that. They had pretty good benefits but the more he talked about the position, the more I got a bad feeling.
Jess (whoozica): Monies not everything, changing jobs is stressful af so if you had a bad feeling then i think its better to go with your gut
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He said that the machines they design are so complex that there would be about a 2-3 year learning curve just to understand it all
Matt (mattmyers25): I agree with Jess
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And they're looking for someone who intends to stay there long term, like 10+ years
Matt (mattmyers25): Could you see yourself there for 10+ years?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Absolutely not
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I honestly don't see myself EVER staying with the same company that long
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This probably sounds bad, but I get bored after a while and want to experience different things
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ im the same way erik
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Well, you eventually want a career somewhere for long term benefits. But work environment is a HUGE part of the job, if you weren't going to enjoy it then fuck it.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): any company that needs that much a comitement is too much
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): (at least for me)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And even though there are actually more engineers, they're all electrical and I'd be the only mechanical so that was also a huge nope
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And the fact that he made the decision so quickly tells me they're desperate to hire someone ~~even though I'm pretty sure I'm only the second to interview~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think you made a wise decision for yourself
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but it was good to get out there and do the interview
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah, I agree
