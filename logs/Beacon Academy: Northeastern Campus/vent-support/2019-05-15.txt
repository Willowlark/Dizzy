Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am so pissed that I had to go on a dog and pony chase to meet with my advisor this past semester... cause now fucking everything I need to graduate by next year is filled up pretty much... Ughh
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: tell that to her. like. tell her that you found it highly inconvenient and that you're upset that now your graduation plans are fucked because she wouldn't respond and now you dont know what to do.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: real talk; email profs of those classes n sit in on them if they think they'll have ppl drop it
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: just be like so i was tryna get into this can i attend and do you think room will open
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Imm have to talk to somebody. I worked it out that I found classes I can take that do cover things I need with a few just to cover credits I need as well. But liek kinda stressed a lot of my important classes I need to fucking graduate I have to take the last semester >.< Which I don't want to... but ugh
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: oh no complain to your dept.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: but like. tastefully express your displeasure to your advisor
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I may also talk to my mom and convince her to have me take at least 2 summer classes to help. She changed ehr mind but if I am motivated to take them and wanting to thennnn... Like it would help me out too.
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: and express how severely inconvenienced you are and like. idk make up stuff like 'im not financially prepared to be able to take an extra semester
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: make ur advisor feel guilty
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: they get paid fuckin enough
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa Imma need to message someone and bitch someone out cause I am beyond stressed. Like this is ridiculous that I am now kinda fucked cause half of what I need is either filled OR not offered in the fall... ughh
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: 150% bitch
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: because if you tried multiple times to meet your advisor and she ignored you, thats not your fault
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: ~~dean of students if u REALLY wanna bitch if your dept is like well that sucks~~
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: n be like no one would clear my holds and everything is filled
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: i am. a pro at complaining to authority
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The one time was my fault, the second was hers... she agreed to meet and then moved her office hours without telling me, then went to departent head and she never got back to me... it took me talking to the secretary to finally get shit done. God bless Kim.. if it werent for her I'd still be fucked
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: hnnn still sounds mostly her fault
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Kinda yea .-. Its someones fault. Cause i reached out several times. But was ignored
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol what? This is so random
