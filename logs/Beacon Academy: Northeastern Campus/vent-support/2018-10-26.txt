Marisa (Weeb): My One for All shirt got these weird rust-colored splotches on it, I think it picked it up from the wash. Itâ€™s not devastating and Iâ€™ll still wear the shirt but itâ€™s sad and Iâ€™ll probably only use it for PJs now. ;u;
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Aww.. yeah I know that feel
Erik (slendergiant): So our quality guy got canned today. Praying that doesn't add more work into my load even though I know it will ðŸ™ƒ
