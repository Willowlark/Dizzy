Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: aand imma cry at work because i went and personally asked HR for my damn employment letter ad got told it was 'low priority'
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: like i guess two sentences on company letterhead is too much i fucking guess
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: *like i didnt specify i  need it for  a lease*
Jess (whoozica): Do you have company letterhead? You could type it up and just walk in and be like "can you just sign this please?" Idk if that would work
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i actually asked if i could write the copy and if she could check and sign it
the answer was no
Jess (whoozica): WTfGGfgGgfgfff
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: its literally like 'this is to specify that ____________ is employed at RAEL as a ________ with a salary of ______ and started employment on DATE
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: im serious
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: im going to slash tires and/or have a mental breakdown
Jess (whoozica): Is HR just that that one shitty lady?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: it seems. shes compliance/payroll
Erik (Red Riot Thot): can't you submit paystubs as proof of employment?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i did they need both -_-
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: NYC housing is absurd they also needed my tax return and then all the regular background check stuff
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: im about to ask if i can send every paystub ive gotten from this company

Erik (Red Riot Thot): geez... that's so excessive
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ™„ still bullshit... like if that sentence is all you need she can't take 5 seconds to type it? Geez
Erik (Red Riot Thot): mine I was supposed to provide only pay stubs but the guy was like "nah, don't worry about it"
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: yeah im just. I mean makes sense for NYC housing but still
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh true yeah

Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: like pls take my firstborn son as well
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn that's a lot...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Could you give the landlord of the property your HR's number and have them call for proof. Like verbal proof? And also let them know HR is giving you crap cause they say it's low priority for some reason?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: if i dont get it by today like
