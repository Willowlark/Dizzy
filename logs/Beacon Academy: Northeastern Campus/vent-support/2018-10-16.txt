Heather (batgoddesscosplay): IM VERY VERY SALTY AND FED UP! IM TIRED OF DRAMA PEOPLE NEED TO LEAVE MY FRIENDS ALONE I WILL FIGHT A BITCH!
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Does anyone feel this ? Because I'm getting super tired of it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes
Erik (slendergiant): So a couple months ago we put in a bid for a potential new customer (which I was dreading if we got it because it was A LOT of assemblies and it would require A LOT of work on my end, plus we don't really have enough people to do it). But my boss was all gung-ho about it because if we got it it meant we could make more money (because that the only thing he cares about). I just got an email from them saying they weren't going to go with us and I dabbed in my office out of excitement
ZombieHunter: ~~I’m tired and need hugs~~
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/cat-hug-relationship-JzsG0EmHY9eKc
ZombieHunter: You ever have days you wanna sleep and never wake up.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep. A lot of days honestly.
ZombieHunter: I just want everything to stop
snow ( karma chameleon ): Valid
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Me today. I wanted to sleep more and ended up over sleeping almost being late for a midterm 😫
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thankfully I made it just on time and was able to find parking close due to people leaving 🙌🏻
snow ( karma chameleon ): You were up until passed 3 am
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was 😫 cause my sleep schedule is all messed up. I hope it gets fixed soon cause ugh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I collapsed at 9:30 and I woke up at 6 

But I still feel tired
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~oversleeping can make you more tired than getting a normal amount of sleep~~
Erik (slendergiant): **this ^**
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that’s probably what happened
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Which sucks because 9:30 is my usual bedtime
Erik (slendergiant): Bless you for being able to go to bed that early
Jess (whoozica): thats only 9 hrs tho thats not much "oversleeping"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): only 9 hours
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😂
Jess (whoozica): isnt recommended 8 tho?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 8 but I feel even worse if I wake up on even increments because of how REM works
Jess (whoozica): YE
Jess (whoozica): it doesnt matter how long or short i sleep, if i wake up from an alarms im tired, if i wake up on my own im not
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 8, but I think at our age bracket 6 or 7 is technically ideal.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea, i think i feel most awake when i only get like 6 hours sleep
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Valid. I do always feel more tired when I over sleep. I didn't want to though 😫 I planned to be up around 9... and well oops lol
Erik (slendergiant): I never feel awake regardless of how many hours I get 😅
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Big mood 😂
Erik (slendergiant): The **one** time I ever recall feeling awake was when I was *really* tired , passed out at 6pm, woke up at midnight to pee, went back to sleep, and woke up at 6am.
snow ( karma chameleon ): I’m real tired of calling the police over dumb internet shit but alas I gotta
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Da fuq happened now??
snow ( karma chameleon ): Nothing too important tbh I’m just tired and frustrated and nervous
snow ( karma chameleon ): dm me?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): All will be okay. Don't get too nervous.  We are here if you need us ❤ 
And sure,
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I should have dropped this class at the beginning of the semester. I am always so lost when I come in here x.x 
I thought it'd fit more into my major but it doesn't. I am not a music major... 😫
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO I can help you out! I played Piano and Violin for eight years and I’m a singer!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So music is a second language to me
Jess (whoozica): On today's edition of People can't Park:
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 😱
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 🆒
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): People need music help ? OwO 
I've played piano and sang since I was a child 
Its almost literally my life blood
Jess (whoozica): Thats in addition to the other guy so we we're down 2 spots this morning
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof I wish it was a class more like probs what you are thinking. Sadly its just mostly most note taking (and he goes through the power points so fast) but like half of what he is talking about people learned in previous music classes I feel and I am like uhhh I barely know what that means... I thought it being "The history of recording" it'd connect some to broadcasting... but nope it's all music based. Or like recently it's all about copyright which I've already covered twice in my majors classes lol. D: So much for being helpful in my major like I thought lol. Like if we were dealing with instruments, reading notes or etc like that'd I'd be okay cause I know some and can get help but nope... 
And oof... is this the same asshole guy??
Jess (whoozica): Nah this is someone else that's only here this week
Georgia (Something Sensible): Y A L L my roommate is moving OUT
Georgia (Something Sensible): THERE IS A GOD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): FUCK YEAH
ZombieHunter: Holy shit the crazy one?
ZombieHunter: Party at Georgia’s ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Jess (whoozica): THANK GOD OMG
Tom (tomukuncosplay): WOOOOOOO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WHAT THATS AWESOME NEWS!
Did she cave <@!245270932602486784> ?
Georgia (Something Sensible): I ran into the RA and she was like “did you know Sarah put in for a transfer to another suite with an empty spot?”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I was like oh I did not 😏
Georgia (Something Sensible): And she was like oh I guess I wasn’t supposed to tell you then whoops
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sarah hasn’t told any of us herself but like??? Good news my dudes, Georgia can have friends over past 10:30, and they can sleep over now
ZombieHunter: Okay but
ZombieHunter: Shoots
ZombieHunter: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Georgia (Something Sensible): Theoretically I’ll have a two person bedroom to myself so 😏
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like we could convert her bed into something with a backdrop
Georgia (Something Sensible): ILL HAVE TWO CLOSETS OMG
Georgia (Something Sensible): At least for the rest of this semester
Erik (slendergiant): Push the beds together. Mega bed
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): **BUNK BED**
Erik (slendergiant): *or mega bed*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i personally would go for the...hanging a bed from the ceiling
Casey (Raining_Jellyfish): hanging from what on the ceiling is the true question
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~sidenote: i've never noticed how much fucking luggage weiss has in the corner~~
Jess (whoozica): They're following nme guys. This person is taking up 4 spots
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Sadly you arent allowed to hang things from the ceiling in most college dorms 😞
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s jersey tho
