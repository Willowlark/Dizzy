Monica (absolutezerocosplay): aww ;/
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): An article I read once always comes to mind when I’m worried about how I look to other people. “90% of people don’t give a shit about you”. The author then proceeded to wear clown shoes around town and no one cared. 

The 90% have their own agendas and worries and aren’t going to worry about you, nor say or do anything cruel. The remaining 10% are the people who love and support you and want you to get out there and do want makes you happy. 

It’s not... perfectly relevant, but I always take comfort in that.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like this statement 😮
I need to make a mental note of this now too when I feel down about myself...
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Bill comin in with those words of wisdom 👌
Mark (Mad Doctor): Bill speaks wisdom, and it reminds me of a text we used to read in my freshman seminars. It was Plato's Crito, one of his Socratic dialogues. In it, Socrates acknowledges the power of peer pressure, but he makes the point that not all opinions are equal. If you're feeling sick, you should value the opinion of a medical professional, not the results of a SurveyMonkey. Likewise, when it comes to questions of self-worth, should you trust the people who know you well, or the ignorant haters who might cross your path? Why should we care what ignorant assholes think of us, and why should we consider changing our behavior for them?

Smart guy, that Socrates
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Call me Senpai, Biru Senpai.
