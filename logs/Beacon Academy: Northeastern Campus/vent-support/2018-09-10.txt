Georgia (Something Sensible): My roommate is being THE biggest annoyance
Georgia (Something Sensible): She texted me on Friday asking if I could stop having friends visit the room
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I said "ok how about we talk about it as a suite on Monday, because we live with four other girls"
Georgia (Something Sensible): And she sends me this
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): "Hey so can your friends basically only come over once a month, leave before 8 pm, and not be here for more than an hour at a time"
Mak (hollyjollymak): ???????
Mak (hollyjollymak): That.... makes no sense
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mak, as an RA, can you weigh in on this
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ???? Strangers like aren’t they people you probably invited over last semester?

Sorry that’s bullshit
Erik (slendergiant): Can you get a room reassignment because that's fucking shitty
Georgia (Something Sensible): I also told her my parents just filed for divorce, and my grandpa just died, so I need the support of my friends
Georgia (Something Sensible): She doesn't give a SHIT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): “Can you not have any friends?”
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): wow that is terrible...
Mak (hollyjollymak): Yes
This is something you can discuss with your RA if you'd like, and say that this is a completely unreasonable request, and that this is a *shared* living space that you have as much right to as she does
Erik (slendergiant): You need to file for a room reassignment
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm sorry about that :/
Rebecca (madameterralupus): She sounds really annoying... I agree with Erik's comment. See about getting a reassignment.  She sounds like a jerk who doesn't want any fun, and only cares about her comfort....
Erik (slendergiant): That's ri-damn-fucking-diculous
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like no. Just no I’m sorry but like that’s not fair. Yeah you need a room reassignment
Georgia (Something Sensible): And it sucks cause my four other roommates are totally cool
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Has she pulled this before?
Georgia (Something Sensible): But SHES the one I share a bedroom with
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nope, she signed the roommate agreement saying it was okay for friends to be over given prior warning
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And all the other girls agree? Sarah has no say in the shared space. If she’s out numbered, she is.
Erik (slendergiant): Talk to your RA and be like "Yeah this isn't going to work. One of us needs to go somewhere else"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Talk to the RA. Hell, the best solution would be for Sarah to get a solo room somewhere.
Mak (hollyjollymak): Then pull *out* that roommate agreement, say it needs to be renegotiated, and that you have an even say on this shared space as well
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I agree with Mark
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Since she’s a bitch~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *Mak
Mak (hollyjollymak): She's going really petty, but if you can show up and be the mature person, you look that much better
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): My response, voila
Erik (slendergiant): Like, if this girl doesn't like other people, why didn't she request a single or EVEN A ROOM THAT'S NOT PART OF A SUITE
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That’s a good response imho
Mak (hollyjollymak): There you go, mature as shit response
Mak (hollyjollymak): Now be petty in here lmao
Marisa (Weeb): O yeah that’s so weird. If there’s a living room it shouldn’t be a big issue
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Man what is with the people at Rutgers. I never had such weird roommates.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah the five other girls I lived with are all carried over from last year
Marisa (Weeb): If the other roommates agree with you make an intervention banner
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I have had my fair share of bad roomies
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea this girl seems kinda nuts. And really rude :/ like I get bedrooms but like a common shared area..?? Can she not just be a normal human in college... zone that shot out with headphones and going in another room lol. That's what I did when I disliked my roommates friends over
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So I feel this
Georgia (Something Sensible): I  switched buildings to be on the science campus, moved in with them, and replaced a girl who left
Georgia (Something Sensible): Now I know why she left LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh yeah she doesn't want anyone to set FOOT in the bedroom
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Jeez what the hell
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~two weeks later you walk in on her throwing a rager~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I let my roommate and her bf have time in the bedroom I always said just give me a heads up okay?
Marisa (Weeb): If she wants private space she should get loans and a private apartment
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Erik (slendergiant): ~~probably hiding her portable meth lab~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like what’s up with this girl 

Yeah I agree <@!301927856240459777>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~orgy to follow~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If she’s that anal about it
Marisa (Weeb): This took a very nsfw turn
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Seriously sounds like she should have a single dorm.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like that’s specifically why I opted for the off campus apartments at WCU. I got my own room I could shut myself in
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s a level of antisocial that’s not fair.
Georgia (Something Sensible): She's like really conservative
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like if my roommates were playing shit loudly I’d just shut my door and put in headphones 

Oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): YE my dorm the last three years was two bedrooms, one person a piece. Very nice.
Georgia (Something Sensible): We hashed out the roommate agreement before school started and she was like "no one sleeps over ever, especially not boys"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~go to bible college then~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And what did the roommates say?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Other than you I’d course
Erik (slendergiant): *I can't let strange boys look at me or I'll become pregant*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): PURGANTE?!
Marisa (Weeb): Is it just an issue with guy guests? Or every guest? Not that it makes much difference but maybe it’s a big deal
Georgia (Something Sensible): I said "okay I understand, I won't have BOIS sleep over. I understand all people aren't comfortable with men, even though some of my best friends have been male"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I get it, maybe she's a victim of sexual assault and didn't wanna say anything
Georgia (Something Sensible): But F R I E N D S?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And wouldn’t they just stay out in the living room anyway?
Marisa (Weeb): ^^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like
This girl needs to understand welcome to college life
Georgia (Something Sensible): She said even that wasn't allowed
Marisa (Weeb): !?
Georgia (Something Sensible): And then she "called her mom and said that wasn't okay"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The world isn’t going to revolve around all her wants
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OH NO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): One of those
Mak (hollyjollymak): Christ, she called her mom?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah no this girl entitled as fuck.
Mak (hollyjollymak): If she gets your RLC involved..... I feel bad for that RLC
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ...”Mom said it’s not okay because I can’t think for myself”
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sounds like a tyrant in training
Marisa (Weeb): Because everyone knows Rutgers is the holy grail of purity
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I had a roommate like that it was horrible and I even said to her “Hunny. You’re 21. You can think for yourself”
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~Rutgers has a nickname of Slutgers let's be real~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 😏
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Nothing wrong with going to a parent for advice. Hell I still ask my parents for advice but it’s just a opinion and I don’t have to listen to their opinion if I don’t want to.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Georgia, you have the right instinct to insist on a roommate meeting. Reason wins over crazy only when it has numbers
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Agreed!!!!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If the other roommates are like “Okay what...?” Then it’s more than just a 1 on 1 issue.
Marisa (Weeb): Does anyone else ever bring over friends?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): especially about the common space. 6 people should be involved in those decisions.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah other people have had friends over before!
Georgia (Something Sensible): Admittedly I have friends over most frequently but like... I'm having the September from hell
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I even _told_ her
Georgia (Something Sensible): And she doesn't have friends over ever so like
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~doesn’t have any remember~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): That's why she can be so stubborn about this kinda thing
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah you’re going through a rough patch and you NEED SUPPORT! Sometimes online support isn’t enough. You need physical comfort and friends. 

I don’t get why she can’t see that.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like
She needs to stop being entitled and self centered and look at the big picture
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah! And to keep it under an hour and disband it before 8 pm... like what kinda rules are those...
Georgia (Something Sensible): She's like so conservative tho so Im definitely gonna mess with her
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~this kind of nonsense is why I don’t want to move out with people I don’t know if I can’t get my own place~~
Marisa (Weeb): And don’t forget - always be an arms length apart and keep the lights on
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like whistle into the room after showering and just DROP the towel like "oh don't mind me changing"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like
Okay so when are technical quiet hours?
Georgia (Something Sensible): 11 pm to 10 am
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I always have friends leave by 10:30
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay so here’s a compromise proposal 

Everyone out by 9:30-10.
Let her know if you’re bringing friends over
Keep noise to a happy medium

I assume you do this already...but by the sound of it she doesn’t get it
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I already do this
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like she insists that dorms are study places
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *two girls, 5 feet apart in a dorm room cause they not gay*
Georgia (Something Sensible): They're not, if you've lived in a dorm, you KNOW
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Uhh
That’s what a library is for
Georgia (Something Sensible): EXACTLY
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is there a student mediation office? Sounds like an outside party could restore reason to your situation
Georgia (Something Sensible): and we have two study lounges per floor
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RA would be the one to talk to.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I messaged my RA to speak to her tomorrow night
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Dorms are a place where you can relax, chill, sleep, etc. it’s a home away from home
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Then it goes bumped to RLC.
Georgia (Something Sensible): My RA loves NASA so I'm not saying I have a leg up....... but I totally do
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Dorms are living spaces. Apartments.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): She should really REALLY look into other options if she won’t compromise
Marisa (Weeb): Show up to the meeting in an astronaut suit and it’s in the bag
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~like a convent~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like honestly she needs to learn that she’s in the real world and not everything is going to go her way.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^^
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah like she clearly thinks boys are gross
Georgia (Something Sensible): When I brought up the fact that I may like to have an hour alone with one she was like ew why
Marisa (Weeb): Because cooties
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Boys are totally gross tho you know. 😋
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Which is fine XD
Idk personal talking, maybe the hanky panky like who cares???? Just be like “cool bro thanks for letting me know!”
Marisa (Weeb): Maybe she’s worried for your well being like the baby in Spirited Away with germs
Georgia (Something Sensible): Lmao we agreed on the terms right when I moved in
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Remind her of that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yup.
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I brought up the fact that Hal would regularly drive 2 hours to see me and would need someone to sleep
Georgia (Something Sensible): First she said he can't sleep in my bed, then he can't sleep in the living room, THEN he can't sleep in the suite at all
Marisa (Weeb): Is this conversation on your phone
~~leave it  open on your computer passive aggressively~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like it's crazy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Nani the fuck that’s not cool
Georgia (Something Sensible): My two past roomies I was like "can I get the room for an hour" and they'd be like no problem
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She doesn’t get to decide for the whole apartment?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^^^^
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like yeah if the other roomies are cool with guests staying over in the living room, she’s out numbered
Georgia (Something Sensible): I couldn't give a shit frankly
Marisa (Weeb): Tell her if she wants to control the apartment that much she should pay for it all
Marisa (Weeb): Capitalism baby
Georgia (Something Sensible): If my roomie wanted to go to pound town 2 hours a day, 7 days a week I'd be willing to work things out with her
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Mawisa *savage*
Marisa (Weeb): Thank you comrade
Georgia (Something Sensible): She probably thinks I'm a SINNER
Georgia (Something Sensible): _throws Satan books on her bed_ ha
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Good plan.
Jess (whoozica): It's true tho, like if she wants that much control over a shared space, then it probably shouldnt be shared?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Your roomie is trying to use the authority of "everyone agrees with me" on you. Call that bullshit out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Paint your nails black after she goes to bed, then say you have no idea how they got that way in the morning.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Keep doing it.
Mak (hollyjollymak): Yeah, there is no dream scenario where you get everything you want in a shared room. That's why it's shared! Because you have to compromise.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP!
Mak (hollyjollymak): Fuckin call me up if you need it. I'll be your second RA.
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH MAK
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like idk she signed the roommate agreement agreeing to other terms
Georgia (Something Sensible): And now she's like wait I want complete control
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I’d bring that up and sip your tea
Erik (slendergiant): Plaster the room in pentagrams
Georgia (Something Sensible): Maybe she's just mad that the presence of my friends reminds her that she has none......
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like also let the other roommates know too 

POSSIBLY!
Marisa (Weeb): I’ve found many furry Christian memes if you need any
Erik (slendergiant): *"Henlo friendo, thank you for driving 2+ hours to visit me for a maximum of 59 minutes"*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Georgia (Something Sensible): "Also please leave by 8 pm"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Y I k e s
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Let’s hire the protesters from Zenkai to praise her for doing the lords work.
Georgia (Something Sensible): "And don't even LOOK in the bedroom"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Constantly.
Jess (whoozica): And don't talk
Mak (hollyjollymak): "If I hear you curse, I. Will. Murder."
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Is she hiding fucking demon books or something
Jess (whoozica): Try not to breathe, actually
Erik (slendergiant): Everyone must sit in different chairs, at least 5 feet apart and cannot speak.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Just stop existing
Evie (Katheryne Knight): There we go problem solved
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hand must be folded in prayer for the full 59 minutes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Fade into the darkness
Marisa (Weeb): Just sit silently with a boy staring at each other from 5 feet away
Marisa (Weeb): Quality bonding
Erik (slendergiant): *Have friends over and try to convince her she's hallucinating them*
Georgia (Something Sensible): O M G
Georgia (Something Sensible): Get everyone to come over in COSPLAY
Marisa (Weeb): omg yes pull A Beautiful Mind on her
Erik (slendergiant): Just keep denying that anyone's over. Make her realize she's actually insane
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ditto to Erik. Pretending like you don’t see them.
Marisa (Weeb): Are you telling me they aren’t already in cosplay when they visit
Georgia (Something Sensible): "What do you mean, Sarah? There's no red headed gladiator anywhere in here"
Erik (slendergiant): by thinking she's insane
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~that’s you silly~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s all an illusion
Georgia (Something Sensible): IM an illusion
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/comment-downvoted-deleting-C87IXdLfJ44Zq
Evie (Katheryne Knight): XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like religion is really helpful for a lot of people, but I think she's judging me by her own religious standards
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Just be Hagakure from MHA
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): What was that will smith movie with the actors pretending to be spirits talking TM him.
Erik (slendergiant): Oh better yet, try to convince her that *she's* the illusion and doen't actually exist
Georgia (Something Sensible): OMG
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!245270932602486784> I completely agree
Georgia (Something Sensible): "Sarah did you know according to particle physics, you don't really exist"
Georgia (Something Sensible): "So I can't talk to a roommate that doesn't exist"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Pppppffffft XD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): “Hi there Sarah. I’m the spirit of pulling the stick out of your ass.”

“Any idea why I’m here?”
Evie (Katheryne Knight): “Do you have time to talk about our lord and savior Pyrrha Nikos?”
Erik (slendergiant): *She died for your sins*
Georgia (Something Sensible): ***pyrrha died for your dickish attitude sarah***
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Time to hang hentai all over your dorm.
Georgia (Something Sensible): hentai, pentagrams, furry memes
Marisa (Weeb): “It’s art”
Marisa (Weeb): All in one image
Georgia (Something Sensible): i hate the fake politeness she has too
Georgia (Something Sensible): like its completely reasonable to be demanding these things from me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s a manipulation tactic.
Georgia (Something Sensible): "hi can you just not have friends over unless they conform to my standards"
Erik (slendergiant): *Tumblr you have failed me*
Georgia (Something Sensible): "hi can you just self-defenestrate yourself"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ll visit you in a priest outfit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She can’t complain.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’ll bless her bed for good studies.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’ll be sure to wear Bible Black Cosplay
Georgia (Something Sensible): _tumblr no_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): With liquid axe body spray.
Georgia (Something Sensible): throws holy water "begone THOT"
Marisa (Weeb): O I know people who cosplay bible black reportedly the costumes are cheap
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WELP I KNOW HOW IM VISITING GEORGIA

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Very alarming.
