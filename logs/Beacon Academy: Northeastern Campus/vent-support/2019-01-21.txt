Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Big mood rebecca
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just wrote like a fucking paragraph to this guy who "hates" Blake for all these dumb reasons and why he sees her as a villain. I am like I'm sorry... WHAT??
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like lmao... ummm
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's an... interesting argument. I don't know how you could possibly make it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also apparently I'm good at avoiding communities that are up in flames, haven't seen anything interesting post bee.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): You're clearly not on Twitter or Tumblr lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): fact and dact again.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't understand either's ecosystem.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need to learn twitter though, cause I just found a blog I used to read isn't dead, their rss is just broken and they update via Twitter.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm happy that the homophobes are weeding themselves out. 

Gotta love when the trash takes itself out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I miss RSS.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm like dumbfounded by how actually stupid a lot of people are
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like the arguements on that "blake is the villain here" post
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm having an aneurysm
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Saaaammmeee.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am like omgggg
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Holy shit I didnt realize people were that dumb
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like I guess I've just been surrounded my smart, open minded people most of my life
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But wow.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm worried for the rest of the world
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I didn't realize how many people seem to think what Adam was doing was okay...  and it scares me of what these people are like IRL... Like oof...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Please don't think what this man did was good. It aint. And please dont do the same
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What scares me even more is that they think it's ok and no amount of explaining why it isnt ok matters
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yupp
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...... holy moly dude
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This fandom scares me lmao
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Glad you guys are cool cause fucking yikes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Oh man idk, Blake wears all black, that makes her a villain duhhhh~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We got you girl.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just can't believe in the year 2019 people are gonna fucking throw a fit over a ship 

Actually wait I can I lived through the FFVII love triangle debate
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Fak
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just googled 'how to use twitter' so I'm official old.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO?
Anna (Cadmium): That's okay I still have no idea how an RSS feed works
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~they're going the way of the dodo, no worries~~
Anna (Cadmium): BUT WHAT WAS IT AND WHY DOES FANFICTION. NET STILL USE IT
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RSS feeds are basically a document that lists the posts on a blog, chronologically. RSS readers would automatically check those documents, hosted on the blog, for changes and add the new article to your view of the feed when it found one. You'd be able to read the summary in your RSS reader, follow the link to the source, or skip over it if it was boring to you.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Kinda like a website twitter.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This was the post and I'm laughing with how dumb their argument is 😂
Anna (Cadmium): So the basis of like what every blog site is but like. Specific to one blog and not able to take content from other feeds
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Right, the feed only shows from a given article.
Anna (Cadmium): Ahahahahhshahaha I left that group after I saw pedophilia apologizers
Anna (Cadmium): #soundslikesomethinganincelwouldsaybutok
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm... somehow... unfamilar with FF's use of them, (I use their app), but for them the blog would be the story, and each chapter would be an update to the RSS.
Anna (Cadmium): Honestly I have no idea how they manage. I think it's just for their website updates
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i never had the app I use the website like a pleb~`
Anna (Cadmium): <@386874959009415170>  LITERALLY WHERE IS THEIR BRAIN LIKE. Thank u trash for taking yourself out
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mostly like the app for offline reading (easier than downloading, converting to epub, transfering to table for one chapter) and updates.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What is my life, my coworker who has spoken to me like once added me on Facebook and sent me this
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And I'm just like ......
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like ... why me
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There are many sarcastic comments.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I cannot decide on anyone.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It is.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): a conundrum.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ummm... 🤔 alrighty then

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hard pass??
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's the worst tattoo I've ever seen
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh I didn't see it was her son's friend... my brain read son... that's even weirder
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Ok so theres like 5 garret kruzes and they are all yuck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): To give the guy credit; he might not know his friend's mom is doing this shit.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is also true
Anna (Cadmium): So it's HIS mom who told her friend he can't get a date
Anna (Cadmium): That's a Dodge in itself
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes yikes yikes yikes yikes

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Listen if people come up to me and rh em might not really be my type I'll still give them the benefit of the doubt and talk to them. But like....... his ... friends mom is trying to hook him up
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): So, red flag
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also def not my type seems like a non ironic 4chan user

Anna (Cadmium): <@334090409389195266> any luck? Are you sure it's the battery? Try to build pressure by turning the key forward one click for a few seconds before trying to start
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): God bless working from home <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've instilled fear of the snow gods in my office, so I pretty much established I don't travel in snow.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Ironic, considering my boss is from Canada*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): > Boss: Contact the customer to see if we can get permission to share their drawing for a component to see if we can get better pricing, but don't tell the customer we're looking to get better pricing because I want to keep the price we're charging them
> Me: Okay, well what do you want me to tell them when they ask if we're going to reduce pricing?
> Boss: *-doesn't give clear answer-*
> Me: *-contacts customer trying to be as vague as possible to get permission-*
> Boss: *-gets impatient with customer not responding quick enough and sends drawing without permission to new fabricator anyway by blocking out customer name-*
> Customer: Can you give be an understanding of what you are trying to do?
> Me: *-has to figure out a way to tell them we want to get this part made cheaper without passing the savings onto them-*
Marisa (Mawisa): Instead of a cheaper price, maybe tell them you’re looking into a place with faster shipping
Marisa (Mawisa): Or turnover time / processing /whatever
Erik (Red Riot Thot): that's valid
Marisa (Mawisa): Or blame it on communication issues with the current company and be like “we’re looking for a new provider as our current one is having issues”
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I had to get a new battery.... ugh ... I do jot feel yike hoing to work now
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Didn't you just get a new battery last year? Or was that in your old car?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ooof
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That was my old car
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): RIP me
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oof
Anna (Cadmium): if its young enough you might be able to complain to the manufacturer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 2010?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Probably not
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lemon law is 2-3 years.
Anna (Cadmium): rip. i mean. 8 years out of a battery is p good
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah. google says average is 3-5 years
Jess (whoozica): my 2013's battery died in 2017
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I had to get mine replaced within 2 years!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The dealership did it though, cause it was clearly bad.
Jess (whoozica): the cold kills them
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeaaa the 3 degree weather probably fucked it
Jess (whoozica): yea it was -3 when i went to start mine this morning
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes
Jess (whoozica): yea we live on a lil mountain so its always colder up there
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, so boss man said we can tell customer that we're looking for alternate sources and price reduction. The customer said he's going to get back to me to see if he can give us permission. If they do, then great, but if not then technically we shouldn't use the fabricator we already illegally sent the drawings to (but I'll bet my boss will still have us buy from them if they're cheaper and just not tell our customer)
Anna (Cadmium): *when you have an urge to 3D print cosplay bits but you dont have enough money for a 3D printer*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What would your budget be for a printer if you were looking to get one?
Anna (Cadmium): hhhhh probs like $400 max. I wouldn't be able to buy it till like november either
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_627175.html?wid=1433363&currency=USD&vip=14843317&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-JXiBRCpARIsAGqF8wWvzOOPcv-Tr2wjjOG4oCXKEPiHjmCsFL8ZNuG6aqY-P9yrwOad9XcaAtWjEALw_wcB
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've been looking into getting a Creality printer because they are on the lower price range, but still give quality prints and has a huge build volume
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm looking into one of the newer upgraded ones which is a few hundred more, but still pretty damn affordable for a 3D printer
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm mostly just waiting to have a place to put it lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *What a mood*
Anna (Cadmium): Definitely a mood. Cant do it till i move though
Georgia (Something Sensible): Late to the car talk, but I got a car in 2015 (it’s a 2012) and my battery yote in 2017
Jess (whoozica): I could not for the life of me figure out why people had off/ asked me if i had off today till i realized its MLK day
Jess (whoozica): i thought schools were closed cuz it was too cold 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah my buddy asked me last night if I wanted to come over to play Mario Kart and I was like, "Sorry, don't feel like making the drive down to Philly to then have to come back at a reasonable time to go to work tomorrow" and he was like "Do you not have off?"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa forgot only a few people have off this holiday. I thought my dad had off but he doesn't
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Only my mom and I are off
Jess (whoozica): the only people that get off are schools and the gov in general
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee

Jess (whoozica): but like your regular business will be open
Erik (Red Riot Thot): my friend works for a beer distributor and has off lol
Jess (whoozica): WTF time to become a beer distributor
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he said they're notorious for not giving days off so he just assumed everyone got off today
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Government owns beer distribution in PA.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s why.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm off and in Joann's right now. 😏
