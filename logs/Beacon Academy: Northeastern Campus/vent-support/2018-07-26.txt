Rebecca (madameterralupus): There's this white van that keeps parking in the lot of our section of the outlet and sitting for a bit, and then leaving. And then coming back. It's like circles and came back 3 times now. Idk who do what it is but it's starting to creep me out... it comes back again my ass is calling security....

Rebecca (madameterralupus): No they didn't thankfully. But it was really weird...
