Marisa (Weeb): WHAT
did you catch this criminal
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I guess not a serious rant, but trying to find a dark brown denim skirt in a size 4-6 is virtually impossible ðŸ˜¦
Georgia (Something Sensible): Really? That seems weird, that's a pretty common size and color I would think
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~if you cant find it in dark brown you could always dye it :D~~
Jess (whoozica): I feel like I used to have one and donated it ðŸ˜­
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I found one that will work fine. It just doesnâ€™t have pockets so Iâ€™ll have to make pouches
