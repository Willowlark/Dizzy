Mark (Mad Doctor): So our freshman class had a town hall meeting yesterday (no faculty present) which quickly turned into a shitstorm. The topic was "are all voices equally heard at school." It quickly turned into a shouting match, with conservative students (who claimed they were a persecuted minority) shouting anti-LGBTQ and anti-feminist slogans and drowning out anyone who spoke against them with chants. I had to spend my freshman classes today teaching about how to have a civil discussion.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lmao I'll have mark write an excused absent for me xD and confuse my professor xD~~
