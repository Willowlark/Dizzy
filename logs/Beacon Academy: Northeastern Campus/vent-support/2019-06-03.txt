Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: There's running into someone u know at a con from the real world and then there's running into one of your sorority alumni at a con
Thankfully shes like one of three who does stuff like this (her bf is part of the jedi group who teaches light saber fighting classes) but like I had a full 3 seconds of sheer terror being recognized by someone who knows my real last name ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ....I am the only associate working tomorrow until like 2/3pm... WHY
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Look our new agm is nice and super cool but she makes some really weird schedules
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: That's. Weird. 
Maybe let her know it's hard to do things with one associate bc you can't be in 2 places at once
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean we have others on but it's all managers mostly. It's just weird that I am the only regular associate? O.o
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: That is really were
