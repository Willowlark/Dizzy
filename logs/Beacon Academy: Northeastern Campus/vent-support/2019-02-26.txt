Erik (Red Riot Thot): So one of our customers is complaining that connectors from an assembly we sent them over a year ago are broken. We've had so many issues with this stupid fucking plug because it's a larger cable with a stiff rubber gasket on it so when we tighten the cable clamp, they have a tendency of breaking because of the stress being applied from the compressed rubber. We've literally tried everything and we're torquing everything to the minimum value stated by the manufacturer of the plug and they keep breaking. Now the customer is blaming it on us over torquing a nylon screw (which we do by hand instead of with an electric screwdriver because nylon is soft and we don't want to strip it)
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You're going to Hershey?? I'll come kidnap and save you lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's just frustrating because it's clearly a manufacturer defect because they're probably using cheap plastic
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And we keep doing corrective actions to try to solve the problem but there's like, nothing more we can do
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you probs cant tell them to complain to the manufacturer either -_-
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think we've tried contacting the manufacturer about it. Dunno really what happened with that because that was our quality guy's job who's since been fired
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but like... this was all... over a year ago... and they're bringing it up now
Erik (Red Riot Thot): clearly they're breaking over time, otherwise we would have heard about it a year ago when they received them
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): So I'm honestly really bummed out and not sure what to do...
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I had a group cosplay planned for Zenkaikon but 2 of the people in the group of 4 apparently completely forgot I existed and asked someone else to fill the cosplay I was supposed to do.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> Wtf. That really sucks... Have you spoke to them that you are still interested and if you can still be that chara for the group? Or maybe use both you and the other person and just swap out in photos?
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I haven't approach either of them yet. I think the whole mess started because there's been no organized group chat or anything. But I'm honestly not sure how to deal with this because I don't want to cause drama. I still want to do the cosplay, but another part of me doesn't want to even do it anymore because I don't want to be the "extra".
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Like we had been talking about it for a few months so I didn't think it was possible to forget?
Jess (whoozica): oh no! Im so sorry to hear that üò¶
Jess (whoozica): are you friends with the person or not really?
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): That's the thing. I'm friends with all the people who were originally part of the planned group. But the person they asked is one of their girlfriends. So like I feel pretty hurt but at the same time I don't really want to cause a huge mess
Jess (whoozica): What the heckie
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa I totally understand your feelings on that. :\ Sucks there hasn't been organization on it. That always seems to cause mess. And oof, yea... That's really rough. I'd say maybe talk to one of them about it and see what they say. Just carefully message them and say hey I saw you put so and so as this character, I thought I was to be them? Just simply ask in a nice way maybe?
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Yeah that sounds like a sensible plan. I think I'm just going to let things sink in before I say anything. I don't want to get too emotional.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. I'd talk to them about it though. You can also still do the chara on your own and get some awesome pics I am sure if worse comes to worse.  But I hope you get it all sorted out and can still be a part of the group as originally planned ‚ù§
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Thanks so much for the support. I'll keep y'all posted on what happens
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Funny thing is I saw the gf post a wig in her story the other day and I was like, "Huh I wonder... Nah it couldn't be." 
I hate when my paranoia is right
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üò≠
