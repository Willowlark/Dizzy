Mark (Mad Doctor): My mother in law wrote to my wife, telling her to be suspicious of Audrey's teachers, since these days they are confusing kids "so that they don't know whether they are boys or girls." Then she added "it's better to force her to act like a girl, since that is more natural." Guess Audrey's rainbow flags raised red flags
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Please tell me you set that letter on fire
Mark (Mad Doctor): Twas an email. We shared a good laugh. It's not teachers that cause gay.

It's fluoride in the water
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Well that certainly explains New York
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The chemicals in the water are not only turning the freaking frogs gay, but also the youth of MURICA
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Dear lord...
Mark (Mad Doctor): Small price to pay for great teeth, if you ask me
