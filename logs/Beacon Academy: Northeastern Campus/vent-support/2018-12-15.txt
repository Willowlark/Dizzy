ZombieHunter: So some guy in Casey’s server kept trying to talk to me. Like if I left the server, they’d leave. If I joined, they’d come back. When Jake and squad were like leave hunter alone, he was like nooo I wanna introduce myself.
ZombieHunter: The realization? Vocally, he thinks I was a girl.
ZombieHunter: 😐
ZombieHunter: Me: I have a STALKER
He thinks I’m a LADY
He’s really not gonna like my dick.
ZombieHunter: >.>
you want fucking rwby chibi?: <:stab:410286641668685825> ?
ZombieHunter: Yeah probably
ZombieHunter: I’m so done rn
Marisa (Mawisa): How did he even know when you rejoined? That’s so freaky
ZombieHunter: He’s literally
ZombieHunter: Watching for me to join
ZombieHunter: Legit.
ZombieHunter: we left for like 30 minutes to laugh
ZombieHunter: Tested it again by going back to that voice chat
ZombieHunter: And he /came back/
Marisa (Mawisa): Ooo I thought you meant like you left the server and then rejoined
That’s so messed up and scary
ZombieHunter: He thinks I’m a girl
ZombieHunter: Honey no
Marisa (Mawisa): Flex him out of existence
ZombieHunter: He’s really not gonna like my penis
ZombieHunter: Cuz like. They noticed him misgendering me and they were like uhhh
ZombieHunter: Maybe. You should leave HIM alone
ZombieHunter: And he’s like what?
ZombieHunter: And we don’t think it clicked
Marisa (Mawisa): Are you saying that someone the stalker has never met ever and knows nothing about and is judging based on low quality internet sound waves is not the manic pixie dream girl that exists in his head!?!? Shocker. 
He does not sound very bright. I feel like even if people were straight up like “this is a dude. male. bro.” he wouldn’t even get it.
ZombieHunter: I think
ZombieHunter: He thinks they’re messing with him
Marisa (Mawisa): I would say everyone should start calling him a girl but that’d just reinforce the messing part
you want fucking rwby chibi?: send him a picture of a mirror and say Unwanted Dick Pic /j
ZombieHunter: I’m gonna send him the one of my packer
Marisa (Mawisa): ^^^
oooOoOOOOO
ZombieHunter: With googly eyes on it

ZombieHunter: Just make it look like the horuss face
ZombieHunter: 88======D
Marisa (Mawisa): Yes pls
ZombieHunter: I’m so done with my life right now
ZombieHunter: 😂😂😂
ZombieHunter: Ugh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm so sorry Hunter...
Marisa (Mawisa): Does anybody know any games that would work well with kids who aren’t native English speakers? I’m helping host a party tomorrow and found out the girl who recommended me said I knew a ton of entertaining kids games and activities. And I was like “wot”
I have a few ideas that could work but they’re pretty vague
Marisa (Mawisa): A nice old man gave me some cookies and I was looking forward to eating them but I think they fell out of my pocket and now I feel bad for wasting them and possibly littering wherever they fell out ;-;
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Why do people attack me for no reason  ?
ZombieHunter: Murder them.
