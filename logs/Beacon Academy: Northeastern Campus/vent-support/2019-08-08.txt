Rebecca (madameterralupus): ... My steam is broken and is saying I've been playing the sims for 18.5 hours... I played for 30 mins yesterday... It's closed and has since been uninstalled and removed permanently from account. Wtf. I sent in a help message to see whats up. But like.. wattt
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Steam sometimes just. Breaks your times
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm like... wut.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's so weird
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Used to delete dozens of hours off my then-friends borderlands time stamp
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): your sims are trying to break out and transcend into our world
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: I'm going to kill everyone on this goddamn island
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: It has. Taken me. Thirty minutes to go less than two miles. For nothing other than congestion
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof :/
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Geez
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: On top of this HR still hasn't given me my letter of employment I asked for a week ago and has been ignoring me and so I'm probs gonna lose this apartment
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: If I can't fucking get it by tomorrow
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm sorry ðŸ˜¦ I hope they get it to you. That sucks...
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: So  I like actually fuckin screamed bc I'm so stressed rn
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ugh. At least when traffic is caused by construction or an accident you can point to a tangible cause. With congestion it's a bunch of idiots who probably don't have any real reason for being out and about
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: I mean rush hour but like. This is literally the worst I've been in and it's THURSDAY
