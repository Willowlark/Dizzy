Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WOW.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wow.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not only does the other kit in stock NOT HAVE BULBS, they have none of the fucking bulbs in stock.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fuck it going to amazon.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Never been so disappointed.
Jess (whoozica): Where did you get it from?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Unique photo.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Who also sold me the receiver unit for the speedlights so my camera? Can be informed my camera? Took a photo? ???
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Got that resolved at least.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There’s at least one amazon review also saying that kit came without bulbs. Fuck it. Imma find something else to buy entirely.
Jess (whoozica): Maybe none of them come with bulbs? Like a batteries sold separately thing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s on the box “bulbs included”.
Marisa (Mawisa): maybe they meant idea bulbs. like when you get a thought and a lightbulb appears.
Jess (whoozica): Damn
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): <@227431823062466569> what'd you buy?
ZombieHunter: For what
ZombieHunter: Like my studio we used in Georgia’s basement?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ye.
ZombieHunter: ESDDI Lighting Kit Adjustable Max Size 2.6Mx3M Background Support System 3 Color Backdrop Fabric Photo Studio Softbox Sets Continuous Umbrella Light Stand with Portable Bag https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078K6ZNV5/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_ZA3qCbW3279SR
ZombieHunter: I’m remaking the bag but that’s the kit I got
ZombieHunter: Came with 4 bulbs
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I wish "came with bulbs" was something you didn't even have to specify*
ZombieHunter: Every time I work out
ZombieHunter: I laugh at myself cuz while my music is random
ZombieHunter: I put Africa in my playlist and it helps
Georgia (Something Sensible): Bless those GAINS down in Africa
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *It's gonna take a lot to drag me to the gym
There's nothing that a hundred crunches more could ever trim
I bless the gains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to work those muscles we never had*
Anna (Cadmium): *it's an opinion. Let them have it Anna. Let them have their opinion.*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YIKES
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Adam stan
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YIKES
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Bdhdhdh
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~I cant help here I would've ripped them a new one already~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): And this is why I avoid open fandom discussions. What on Earth makes people think an abusive relationship is romantic?
Anna (Cadmium): I think they ship blacksun tbh but
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea same mark.... I just dont understand how a lot of people view things and it gets me heated. Like I'm not gonna be a dick if you shop something other than bees, but if you try to claim that that ship is toxic then I'm gonna get upset....
Anna (Cadmium): I can't start shit. I mod that server rip
Rebecca (madameterralupus): People are claiming bees are toxic?? Really? HOW?!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It's perfectly reasonable to sip blacksun, but to go as far as saying bees are toxic to aid your own ship is like..... huge red FLAG nope from me
Anna (Cadmium): Like. Ok. Bee FANS can be hella toxic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea that's different
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The fans can be too much
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But the actual ship
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): No
Anna (Cadmium): But. I thought it was a pretty natural normal having internal struggle progression
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Every ships fans can be toxic 🤷 But actual ships depend on characters... Just cause the fans are shitty doesnt make the ship so
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea....
Anna (Cadmium): But Adam literally gaslighted blake
Anna (Cadmium): So
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👆
Mark (Mad Doctor): Agreed. It looked like blacksun was in the cards for a while, and that's ok. Each character in that relationship was able to grow.  But wanting Blake to end up with her tormentor... Wtf is the deal with that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like hes all bad news
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And physically abused her
Anna (Cadmium): <@334090409389195266> btw lower tension or higher for sewing spandex while you're here
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Lower
Anna (Cadmium): Yeah he fucking like. If not physically mentally
Anna (Cadmium): Thx
Anna (Cadmium): I swear he threw her around when they were together
Anna (Cadmium): But I thought it was mental until she ran away and then it was all physical
Anna (Cadmium): Like bruh he stabbed her
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yang threw her around, too. And it was awesome
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The way he naturally grabbed her neck when they met on the radio tower
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like... he didnt even hesitate... he never hesitated to hurt her when she wasnt obeying
Anna (Cadmium): And threaten to hurt those she loved
Anna (Cadmium): That's abuse
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea theres NOTHING healthy about their relationship. Not to mention she was 15 or younger and he was over 18
Mark (Mad Doctor): Can I just say that the combined Bumblebee fight moves all depended on mutual trust. And that is the kind of "characterization through fighting" that Monty was aiming for
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Deff abuse. Adam was a psycho.
Anna (Cadmium): It really did
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh ye, forgot about the age difference.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also yes mark, good point
Anna (Cadmium): Adam is literally that guy in college dating the high school girl
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yupp
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): He is predatory and abusive
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like .. HUGE yikes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): No one should stan him
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Or think he was good for blake
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Deff not
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wonder what the gender ratio of Belladonna shippers is. I'm gonna guess 100% male
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~is stan a verb~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Though he is a good villain, so I can see why people would like him narratively. However, there have been far too many Adam apologists coming out of the woodwork since the beginning of this fight ark
Mark (Mad Doctor): Is now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thinking he is a neat character and good villain like I do is fine, people like awful shitty characters all the time but don't idolize him or think he's a good. Cause he sure as hell isn't. There's many signs pointing to show he ain't.
Anna (Cadmium): Like. Cool motive still murder
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea agreed
Anna (Cadmium): He's a fantastic villain
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): He is, hes the best written one on the show, I'll give that to them.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Best one in the series right now. He was always going to die, I just wish the milked the character for all the evil, because it could be great character development for Blake/Yang/bees.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But absolutely should not be idolized or forgiven for all the evil hes done simply because people think hes cool
Anna (Cadmium): Like. He is everything I fear in men long story short
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh same anna
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): He terrified me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And that's why I hated him so much
Mark (Mad Doctor): Gilette needs to make an ad about Adam
Anna (Cadmium): Same
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I like Adam as a villain. That's it.
Anna (Cadmium): Adam taurus throws out his Gillette razors
Anna (Cadmium): Exactly like. FANTASTIC villain and he actually had his own motive etc
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Adam Taurus poses with his guns and hashtags his photos #fuckgillette
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Rebecca finish your fem!Adam for meme purposes~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think Adam is the only villain I like from a series I extremely love that I'm not obsessed over cause he's just THAT much of an asshole lol
Anna (Cadmium): Adam Taurus unironically reads 4chan
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YES. Despite working with Cinder in the beginning he was really the only villain with his OWN goal. He gave no shits about Salem and her shit 

Same rebecca
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But ok going back to the original arguement though, bumbleby is not a toxic ship simply because you dont ship it
Anna (Cadmium): Agreed. Like how tf is it toxic.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Um... How I'd Bumbleby toxic??????? Nani the f u c k??
Anna (Cadmium): They're people. They had their own problems and theyve continued to work through their problems
Anna (Cadmium): They realistically talk more than actual couples
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's the least toxic ship in the entire world, they're working through their issues in a very healthy way
Rebecca (madameterralupus): People just get their panties in a wad too easily. And anything they don't like or agree with is "wrong or toxic" It's the one thing about fandoms that has always irritated me
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Seriously like Nani the fuck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Same rebecca
Anna (Cadmium): Like not everything that makes you angry is toxic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): This fandom is sooo bad with that too
Anna (Cadmium): Not everything that makes you angry is bad
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The second something happens that they dont like they pull the "this is pandering" or "I'm triggered"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Exactly 

Except Adam
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He makes me mad
Anna (Cadmium): ~~you just might have bad taste~~ but like realistically
Anna (Cadmium): Bad timing
Anna (Cadmium): Bad taste in ships
Anna (Cadmium): Adam makes me mad cause he's realistic
Anna (Cadmium): And because I can't stab creeps
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea he unfortunately is
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Exactly he's actually bad. He makes me legit angry
Jess (whoozica): Yea his realisticness is what makes him terrifying
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like okay I did/still do in ways ship BlackSun ~~Leanna's winning me over with bee's though~~ but just cause I like that ship doesn't mean imma do go to Leanna and be like umm excuse me!?You're wrong, Bees are never gonna happen, it's this and that... Like its just rude 🤷 
There's a lot of ships people ship I'm not a fan of but I'm like aight that's cool. And when I see stuff of it instead of getting fucking upset I just ignore it, send it to who I know likes it, etc.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Big mood, I'd never tell you " hey blacksun is toxic"
Anna (Cadmium): Oh I totally saw blacksun and there's enough evidence to say that that's totally what could have happened in the series but it didn't. 
And yeah unless it's like incest or pedophilia I don't tell people it's wrong
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Just because I dont ship it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Like???? Excuse me
Anna (Cadmium): Not my ship but I respect it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Same
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): And I'll do the same wi th any ship as long as its not abuse like tauradonna
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like "Lancaster" and "White Rose" are not my jam but eyyy if you ship it good for you! I am glad. They can be cool. Again, if I see it I just ignore it.I don't go bashing those who do ship it and find reasons to hate on it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Fuck tauradonna
Rebecca (madameterralupus): People are just assholes too easily and literally dig for reasons to hate on stuff -.-
Anna (Cadmium): Fucking yea
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeaaaaa
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I feel this like I ship Bumblby and Blacksun and I'm overjoyed as hell that the bees are canon 

I will never shit one someone for ships unless they are incest or pedophilia
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Everyone needs to chill out and think before they attack others
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Reddit changed the man ship name for tauradonna.
Anna (Cadmium): What is it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Domestic abuse right?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It now reflects the abusive nature of the relationship.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Animal Abuse?
Anna (Cadmium): Beauty and the Yeet?
Mark (Mad Doctor): The way they left BlackSun..."We had some great times, but we need to go our separate ways"... actually came across as heartwarming. "Ship" is short for 'relationship' and that doesn't have to be sexual or romantic or sexual for it to be meaningful.  One of the great things about RWBY is allowing those kinds of relationships to develop
Jess (whoozica): Yea same, as long as your ship isn't dangerous is all good
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Cause Tauradonna came about before we know who Adam was.
Anna (Cadmium): BILL TELL US
Mark (Mad Doctor): "Bull Ship"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LOL
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Bull Shit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am calling it that now.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Beauty and the Incel?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Gen wins the day; Animal Abuse.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Fuck yeah!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Mark (Mad Doctor): I like ours better
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Beauty and the YEET
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Is my fav
Anna (Cadmium): Also like. I just don't want this shit going down in this other goddamn server again we kept having some dude basically come in and every time there was an episode or a new art piece or someone posted cosplay  just shit on it and was more obsessed with gatekeeping than plot development
Anna (Cadmium): So I really don't wanna deal with ANOTHER person doing this shit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yeesh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Can I stab them?
Anna (Cadmium): And claiming ppl who think or do differently are wasting their time etc
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's not how we roll
Evie (Katheryne Knight): CAN I STAB THEM?
Anna (Cadmium): Eh he was like. A fifteen year old incel I think
Anna (Cadmium): He pissed off EVERY SINGLE MOD
Anna (Cadmium): AND THE ADMIN
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Rwby servers are usually a mess tbh.... theres always someone who ruins the fun ~~not you guys obviously~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ban his ass
Anna (Cadmium): he got his ass banned
Mark (Mad Doctor): Just like afam
Anna (Cadmium): We tried the first time to be like that's not how this server rolls sit the fuck down
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yeaaaa.... sometimes it's necessary
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ban his ass
Anna (Cadmium): But then like. Dishwasher posted the Grimm stuff and we were like yo that's lit. 
And then he was like. This is ruining rwby Grimm aren't like this yadda yadda and only wanted to talk about Grimm and how he could list all the species from memory
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yikes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~that's a furry~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes....
Anna (Cadmium): Aaaaaaaand then told the kiwi mod she basically had no chance going pro with cosplay and that she was wasting her time in the same breath complaining that there were too many cosplays of the main girls
Anna (Cadmium): So his ass got banned
Jess (whoozica): Big oofs
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh my God, he deserved it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Jesus Christ
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sadly, if the interwebs have taught me anything, he's unlikely to learn from the experience
Anna (Cadmium): We tried so I honestly just hope I don't find him on another server but I'm only on like. 3
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep he'll move onto another server and complain there
Anna (Cadmium): Not my job let that admin deal with it
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah he's gone
Anna (Cadmium): ~~hopefully he never finds Casey's but Jake or hunter would probs straighten him out REAL QUICK~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh yeah. Yeah they would.
Anna (Cadmium): Literally I cheered when he was gone like I cheered for Adam getting sent to the dead redheads club
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I would do
Anna (Cadmium): I need a drink
Anna (Cadmium): 
Anna (Cadmium): I NEED MULTIPLE DRINKS
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Wow
Anna (Cadmium): FUCKING
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm pouring myself a tall drink
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It's been 6 years of development
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But go off I guess
Rebecca (madameterralupus): "Not much time to develop and mature" UMMMM
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔 🤔
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Listen ......... it's literally been .... 6 ...actual years
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Of slow burn buildup
Anna (Cadmium): I literally said it's been in progress since like S2
Anna (Cadmium): If this was a fanfic it would have the tag of "a burn so slow you could smoke a ham on it"
Georgia (Something Sensible): YO I REMEMBER THE GUY COMPLAINING ABOUT RWBY AUS
Anna (Cadmium): Hello I am here for the salt
Anna (Cadmium): Fucking purists
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i love how purists and gatekeepers are always ppl who have never tried to sew or wear half the crap from the show~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Truth
Anna (Cadmium): Like 'this person is wearing too short a wig' ok so you wanna pay for my chiropractor bills or
Evie (Katheryne Knight): This guy can suck a dick like a LONG DICK
Jess (whoozica): WTF?!
Jess (whoozica): "gay people can't be main characters"
Jess (whoozica): Nobody need that kainda negativity
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Alright I drank a vodka and pineapple
Anna (Cadmium): I've been reserving the I am a Gay (well. Not straight) card and like  I might have to pull it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm ready to throw down now
Anna (Cadmium): Me: invites Leanna to the server just so she can throw hands
Georgia (Something Sensible): You drank a pineapple damn
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "I've always had a thing against gay stuff being in TV shows"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): First of fucking all
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): What
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's homophobic as HELL
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Invites
> op's Leanna
> Leanna bans
> Leanna is banned for mod abuse
> everything is fine
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I think it's a good plan
Anna (Cadmium): I cannae give op status but I basically told the guy that I highly disagree with the gay characters not having visible relationships thing
Anna (Cadmium): The straights^tm are at it again
Evie (Katheryne Knight): J e s u s
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikey dikeys
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Huge nope
Anna (Cadmium): My house is so cold but like we cannot afford to turn the heat up
Anna (Cadmium): Thankfully we can huddle around that discussion for warmth
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ..they should make heated snuggies
Anna (Cadmium): But rlly I'm cold
Jess (whoozica): 😭
Georgia (Something Sensible): Leanna quit your job we’re going into the hot snug business
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm ready to throw some hands with this Incel

Also onzies are amazing in the cold
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OK IM READY
Jess (whoozica): What kind of heating do you have?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm tempted to buy a kigu
Georgia (Something Sensible): You don’t yet own a kigu? I thought every weeb did
Anna (Cadmium): The heated water pipes in the baseboards but it's oil
Anna (Cadmium): I don't have a normal kigu
Jess (whoozica): Yea oil is expensive after that's what we have
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm a disgrace of the weeaboo kind

I'm also looking for a specific type of Kigu
Jess (whoozica): We supplement with electric space heaters
Anna (Cadmium): Yeah uhhhhhhh power expensive too
Jess (whoozica): Esspecialy cuz one half of our house is above the uninsulated garages
Anna (Cadmium): I'm just gonna put the xbox on
Georgia (Something Sensible): What Kind of Kigu™️
Anna (Cadmium): Hey I also live above the uninsulated garage!
Jess (whoozica): Ayyyyy yea I didn't mean to imply that electric inst expensive, more that the heat barely does shit above the garage
