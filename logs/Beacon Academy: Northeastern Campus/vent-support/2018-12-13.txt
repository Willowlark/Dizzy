Tom (tomukuncosplay): WOOO
Jess (whoozica): Yay!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel... brain dead üòÇ
Marisa (Mawisa): have you tried turning it off and on again
Marisa (Mawisa): maybe blow into the cartridge a bit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): someone got my debit card info so life is great
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg! I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that
Georgia (Something Sensible): What the fuck
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): the first thing they bought was pizza
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): little did they know I'm a broke college student and that after they bought pizza there was only 20 bucks left on my card lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh damn! üò± I hope you get that all sorted out soon. That really sucks!
And üòÇ da fuq.. oh all things to buy they go for a pizza first?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): fucking $36 for Papa John's
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn how fucking hungry were they?!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): ikr
Marisa (Mawisa): Omg that happened to me a few months ago when I was eating pizza!! Pizza here is expensive a large costs $28+ and the larges are equivalent to medium at best. 
Make sure you dispute all the charges ASAP
Marisa (Mawisa): I have an appointment at Tokyo Station this weekend and the big news is about someone threatening to massacre 10 women in Tokyo Station this weekend so pray i don't die üôè
Marisa (Mawisa): ALSO a woman got stabbed at the train station where I work today
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I will kill you if you die.
Marisa (Mawisa): sounds like a good deal
Marisa (Mawisa): they're beefing up security at the station but there's not much that can be done in the way of precautions. the only thing to do is snuff out the violence as soon as it starts and hope no one is fatally injured.
Marisa (Mawisa): the tokyo station dude's twitter handle is something about thinning out the population

Jess (whoozica): OMG mawisa please be safe ‚ô•Ô∏è
Marisa (Mawisa): it'll be like the animes
Jess (whoozica): MAWISA NO
Marisa (Mawisa): i'm considering stuffing textbooks in my jacket to be safe but that won't help if someone with a knife goes for my face/neck/sides
Marisa (Mawisa): I‚Äôm trained in disasters and deviant behavior so at least I can predict where the most likely spots of it occurring are
Jess (whoozica): Beat um up
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Today is off to a great start... üò≠üôÉ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Suggestions for what to do when you sleep through a final/wake up late and won't make it in time?~~ üò≠
Marisa (Mawisa): RUN
Jess (whoozica): email professor while  hightailing it
Marisa (Mawisa): dig out those pics of a flat tire and broken limbs you've been saving
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wouldn't make it with hightailing cause it's across town... Matt told me to email professor so imma do that.
Jess (whoozica): yea email them and explain and ask when you can come in to take it ~~is it a nice professor?~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~he's a fairly nice professor? But I'm not sure when it comes to this~~ and mhmm that's what Matt said to do.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Definitely email them
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~and then calculate what your final grade would be without it~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm just like having a mental breakdown right now.. I can't afford to miss and fail it. I was to not only do a test but present today üò≠
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And noted. I'll try to do that if he has grades posted
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, that goes for any class you're stressing about by the way. If you're doing fairly well in a class, there's a sense of relief if you can calculate the lowest grade you can get to still pass the class.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Noted! ~~I mean I usually do try to do that but I'm not good with math so sometimes calculate wrong and MU professors are dumb and don't always post grades...~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like I once had a really stressful math class and calculated I only needed to get so many points on it to make it out with a D so I focused on getting at least that many points and once I knew I made that I could focus on getting more points. I think I made it out of that class with a B- or something lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I had another class that I was also nervous about but I needed to get a -20 on the final to fail the class so there was some comfort there xD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It does get a little confusing when you have to factor in different weights of different types of assignmnets
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa usually when I calculate grades I use some website made for it lol. 
This just tips my fucking iceberg though... I've already been in a bad mental slump the last few days and now WELP üò≠
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üò≠ My professor actually emailed me noticing I wasn't there and making sure everything is okay. Oof I love him.
Marisa (Mawisa): that's good!!! he knows you're a good student
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hoping he continues to be nice and work things out for me to make it up
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): My bf just put q note on my desk saying hes sorry and that he put his two weeks in and is moving to Florida.
