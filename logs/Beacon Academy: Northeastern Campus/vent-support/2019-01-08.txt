Anna (Cadmium): Pray for my sewing machine it is dropping the bobbin thread lots
Anna (Cadmium): And I need to take it in tomorrow
Marisa (Mawisa): I don’t have any room in my luggage for this and I never wanted to eat it so into the garbage it goes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol what in the world??
Marisa (Mawisa): Bought it at a shrine :3c
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Interesting.. 🤔
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh my god I just realized his face is on the ends of the candy <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol why would you buy such a terrifying thing??
Marisa (Mawisa): funny
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like his face on candy? Who thought of this? 😂
Marisa (Mawisa): Geniuses who know their target market of American tourists 🇺🇸
Jess (whoozica): I wanted to work on cosplay but I had a doctor's appointment after work, had to grocery shop, then dinner, then I worked out and showered and now I'm dead 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww sounds like a long day. Just take the time to rest. 💕
Jess (whoozica): I also have some crampies which is not helping
Marisa (Mawisa): more ab challenges! exercise can help
Marisa (Mawisa): tired? just make yourself more tired
Jess (whoozica): YEA it did a bit and the shower, they aren't really bad they are just making me lazier 😂
Marisa (Mawisa): 8700 yen to mail my box with the cheapest possible method. Oof. At least I know it’s in good hands. There goes my idea of mailing a second package unless I absolutely have to.
Marisa (Mawisa): I closed my bank account there yesterday so when they saw me walk in with a giant box they were probably like “oh no not her again what now”
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
Marisa (Mawisa): Post office girl and I have a bond now
After I messed up the mailing form like 10 times and had to clarify everything about a box’s contents several months ago. She helped me mail it today. 
We tight yo. She knows I’m American.
Anna (Cadmium): imma vent here cause im stressed 
I need to take cat to vet at the same time as my sewing machine needs repair and i gotta order more heating oil and hhhhhh this is taxing on the wallet and brain
Jess (whoozica): 😱
Jess (whoozica): Can you drop off your machine early? And order oil online?
Anna (Cadmium): no i just call to order oil its not hard but like. thats a total of like $600 across all things that i was not expecting to need ot spend
Marisa (Mawisa): amazon has some pretty good deals on sewing machine oil and repair necessities with prime shipping, my mother repairs machines and orders most of her stuff there
Anna (Cadmium): yeah its  like. probs not had a tuneup in ten years theres a place near me but still ike
Jess (whoozica): Yea oils expensive I feel your pain  on that one.
Anna (Cadmium): not as bad as mag who got basically an antique one and it hadnt had a tuneup in like 40 yrs
Jess (whoozica): I hate when everything coms at once like that
Anna (Cadmium): but i dont think i can fix this one myself the needle doesnt want to advance like it gets super stiff
Marisa (Mawisa): 90% of our machines are antiques and they get serviced like once a week lol
Marisa (Mawisa): machine oil!

Anna (Cadmium): to be fair i paid precisely $0 for it

Georgia (Something Sensible): Get you a mans that pays for kitty health
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also I think if it’s dropping the bobbin then it’s a timing error; the needle might be going up or down too soon to catch it
Georgia (Something Sensible): I had that problem at one point
Anna (Cadmium): the place i want to drop the machine at is closed on tuesdays randomly i guess. GUESS IT GOES IN TOMORROW
