Erik (slendergiant): I really wish more of our customers would have their shit together. Like, we have some customers who are prepared and on top of things and already placing orders for January 2019. Then we have customers who want stuff two days after they order it. 😒
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Gotta love people 🙃
Erik (slendergiant): And we're been bombarded with requests for quotes which takes a while to put them together and they want them by the end of the day and it's impeding us from actually taking care of current orders...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww. That sucks. Well good luck with everything >.<
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't get why people can't be smart and realizetbinfs don't happen with a snap of a finger lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Where do you work <@!386874959009415170> ?
Erik (slendergiant): A company that manufactures build-to-print wire harness and cable assemblies
Erik (slendergiant): I love hearing gossip about our company. We're basically broke and we can't pay our suppliers because we have to pay our employees. But if we don't pay our suppliers they put us on credit hold so we can't get material. If we don't have material, we can't make product. If we can't make product we don't get paid by our customers. This company is a goddamn shit show and I have a feeling it's going under soon
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You need to somehow get out of there
Jess (whoozica): if it goes under you can get unemployment 🙌  not that thats better than actual employment but
Erik (slendergiant): Once RTX is over I'm going to be applying to places left and right
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Good idea my dude
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I know for me I’m actually going to start saving so I can start moving out of my house
Jess (whoozica): go frens! achieve your goals!
Erik (slendergiant): I'm trying to find a job further out so I can justify moving out lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm hoping once I'm done with college in the next year and can get a decent not part time retail job I can move out. Although I'd probs have to have a roommate.. 🙃
Jess (whoozica): yea tis hard without a roomate
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah me and Chris are looking to rent a house where he lives
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm deff cause shits so expensive anymore 😫
I wouldn't mind having a roommate... I just had 2 bad experiences in the past so it's have to be someone I know if I did 😂
Jess (whoozica): nice! and yea ive only ever had tom as a roomate but id be scared of rooming with someone i didnt know
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey I’d be a chill roomie we could coscraft together OwO
Jess (whoozica): 🙌
Evie (Katheryne Knight): As long as you clean your shit and share chores I will be good ^_^
Tom (tomukuncosplay): *come apply here* 😏
Jess (whoozica): for a sec i thought you meant to be a roomate and i was like "thomas we have not discussed this"
