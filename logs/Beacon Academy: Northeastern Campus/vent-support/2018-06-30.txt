Rebecca (madameterralupus): Here I was thinking I'd be okay to stay home alone for the next 3 days... boy did I fool myself 😫
I hate this. My house freaks me out.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Loud music!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol basically what I am doing. Our electric bill goes up when I'm home alone late at night. Cause my house is an old three level home.. and dark. So I turn like a shit ton of lights and blare something to drown out any odd noise I may hear 😫
Literally as soon as I'm done working on these gauntlets I'm hibernating in my parents room for the rest of the night... :X
Jess (whoozica): I felt like that first few times alone when I moved 😣
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Normally I'm okay when they go out of town cause I usually had my SO (now ex) stay with me. But I don't got no one now and my mom offered to have a friend of hers stay but I thought I'd be okay 😫
Hoping once I barricade myself in one room for the night I'll calm down 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *yay for living with high anxiety*
Jess (whoozica): I legit like kept a knife near me.
Jess (whoozica): I'm sorry hun! You are going out tomorrow though right?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ I do have a smol dagger... I'm tempt to dig that out now to help me feel better lol
And yeaa. Gonna try to stay out as long as I can so I ain't stuck here panicking again 😫
Jess (whoozica): You have a doggo right? Pets always seem help too
Erik (slendergiant): LANGSTON WILL PROTECC
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao Langston is a useless potato 😂
Jess (whoozica): But you can hugs him ya?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol okay I lied he's kinda useful lol.
And yeaa this is true 😂
Jess (whoozica): Ok so you get your dagger, your doggo and you loud musacs then you build yourself a fort of piklows and plushies. You will impervious to any badies
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This image is beautiful.
Erik (slendergiant): Strap the dagger to his head
Jess (whoozica): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👌🏻 pretty much my plan as soon as i take the doggo out one final time tonight. 
And omg Erik 😂 I don't think Langston could be trusted with a dagger
Jess (whoozica): HE PROTEC
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He wouldn't do much damage either if he attacked, just would stab ankles xDD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s true fear.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He a lazy protector
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He just doesn’t sense any danger yet. Watch, someone walks to close to the house and he’ll be bouncing off the walls ninja dog style.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is true... as soon as I walked outside to have him potty he heard fireworks and got all protect stance. But this is also the same dog who as we speak just jumped a foot in the air when he smelled a bush 😂
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *thats just how he executes his jump combo*
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Hes that metal gear doggo that does the flips
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂😂
