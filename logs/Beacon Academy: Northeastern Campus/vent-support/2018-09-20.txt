Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Figured I’d print the Kalahari bills so I could mark them up. Figured out how to connect to the building printer. Come over to print. Woman’s there and says “mines finishing print, you can put in yours.” Okay, I do that. 

She’s printing *reams* of fucking paper. I could have gone to another floor.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And I don’t want to leave my papers in potential her hands or sitting in the printer tray for anyone to see. It’s got my information on it. SO now I’ll just STAND HERE.
Jess (whoozica): can you cancel the job?
Erik (slendergiant): I was just gonna ask that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nope. Looked. Can’t even find out how many pages she has left.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I don’t do stupid when I’m trying to do things*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *this is stupid*
Erik (slendergiant): Why can't you cancel?
Jess (whoozica): you might be able to cancel on the printer itself but it depends on the printer, some you need to wait till the specific job you want to cancel starts
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don’t have access to the queue. It’s a managed system because it’s building (read 10 floors of wework alone) wide.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s managed via a front end.
Erik (slendergiant): ah
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *uuuuuugh*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *this is inefficient and foolish*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I could just get my laptop and work in the kitchen area but *thats losing and instead I’m just going to emit salt*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^REAMS*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ***REAMS***
Jess (whoozica): did u aak her how much longer?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No. But her coworker had come by and was like “hey, this is going to take awhile”. 

You know. 

*LIKE SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): New plan. *Blow up the printer*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): FINALLY
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Jing is Armonk today (my usual office mate) and Vincent moved into her so as to not share an office with Da Boss.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I remember why I got the noise cancelling headphones.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He has a *humming* habit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): For context, said noise cancelling headphones are dead and I don't have a charger.
Distant Thunders: I wanna fucking diie

Distant Thunders: Head tech fucking left me in charge of a mad house
Distant Thunders: I'm like living in the edge of sanity
Distant Thunders: Luckily almost done but the doc is going way to slow for how many patients we have.  And he was supposed to leave at 5 and we have that many people still here some he hasn't even seen yet.  *Defeated screaming*
