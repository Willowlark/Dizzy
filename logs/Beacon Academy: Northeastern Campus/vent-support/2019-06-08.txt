Anna [Cyborg]: I have to leave my house at 5:45AM tomorrow ðŸ™ƒ because the trains suck on the weekend here.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof that sound awful...
Matt (mattmyers25): Eww. Come have fun with us at ww2 weekend
Anna [Cyborg]: Turns out the train was 5:10 thank God there's two lines
Anna [Cyborg]: *I dead had to catch a 5:43 train RIP. The LOUDEST family is in this car and it's freaking 6:30AM please stop ma'am I'm not caffeinated enough to be a person right now*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Been dealing all week with insane parents. The have ambitions if their B- daughter attending an ivy league med school and they're convinced that her teachers are conspiring against her. I sent them hard gradebook entries to date to explain her current grade. Mistake. The have proceeded to argue about every one of them.  They claim she handed in an assignment on time that I gave her a zero on. When I showed the time stamp that showed she added the assignment two days ago (two months late), *they continued to argue!!!* I finally passed them on to my department head who argued withem for an hour. He finally offered to grade her exam himself. I said, "that's nice man, but anticipating a fight, I already got another teacher to agree to grade it." His eyes narrowed and he quietly said "oh, no. The pleasure will be mine..."

Parents then went to our principal, trying to get us fired. The principal has fielded a dozen such complaints from them this year, so he laughed and hung up.

Poor girl is terrified of her teachers and even more terrified of her parents. She should run away and join the circus. At least it would be a more supportive environment.
Anna [Cyborg]: Damn those parents have surpassed helicopter and turned into bulldozer parents
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Big yikes. Those sound like some horribly awful parents... I feel bad for the poor kid going through so much bs
Mark (Mad Doctor): (am stealing Bulldozer Parents)
