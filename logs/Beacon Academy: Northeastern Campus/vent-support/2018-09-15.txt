Matt (mattmyers25): I am sad I am not at rtx London this year. Seeing all the posts from It makes me miss it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I called the Kalahari today to get an emailed copy of our bill. The woman at the front desk was really sweet, called the con her favorite group, us very respectful, and talked about how the rest of the staff like to join in with the event.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She also wasn't sure if we'd be back next year. =/
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Obviously front desk woman isn't privy to the going's on of the con chair and hotel management, but. Last year I'm pretty sure they announced next year's dates a few days after the con ended.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's got me a spooked.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): yeesh
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There's no where else worth holding east and quite frankly, even with the Sunday crap I don't want to ditch Kalahari. They are *very* good to con goers.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): its a really nice place, and yeah they don't really have anywhere else to hold it so I hope things work out okay

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Why?
Matt (mattmyers25): I blame comcast
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Time to murder Comcast.
snow ( karma chameleon ): The kalahari is hosting CCE next year! I heard it from the con chair and they already have the dates set
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You know what they are? Cause the sooner something is booked the better.
snow ( karma chameleon ): I do! Lemme just find it in my notes haha I’m at work but yeah they’re definitely hosting it!
snow ( karma chameleon ): I wanna say it’s the weekend of the 14th of sept 2019
Marisa (Weeb): Oo what a spook. Front desk girl probably didn’t know the contract. Established cons usually make a deal with a venue for several years and they *always* have the dates planned at least a year and a half early
Marisa (Weeb): It’s strange they haven’t announced the dates on their website
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): <@169297844874903552> con!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Thank Snow. I’ll call tomorrow and see if I can snek a booking in early.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Welp guess I'll call too and see if we can book too.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The question isn’t booking, it’s if the room block is actually available. The con may not have authorized it yet for booking. It’s cooperative thing. But occasionally a hotel employee will let you slide in for the heck of it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm true xD
snow ( karma chameleon ): OK YALL DATES ARE 13-15, not sure if they’ll accept booking yet! But ye : 3
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👌🏻 we can see lol
snow ( karma chameleon ): whispers Ada room
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *whispers back, I'll try my best to do so*
Jess (whoozica): Yoooooo that's Tom's and mine's anniversary weekend
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anniversary con?! 💕
Jess (whoozica): Anniversary con!
