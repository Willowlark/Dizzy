Rebecca (madameterralupus): I hate having achy joints cause teachers always think Im raising my hand when im just trying to stretch ...
Mark (Mad Doctor): Can affirm. Any twitch, twinge, or muscle spasm is generally regarded by teachers as volunteering
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): i made a tiny noise today in the back of the class and was called on
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): so yea
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): :I
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: F

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My company might start paying people to get certifications on their own time and Iâ€™m like. Yes this would be useful. Iâ€™d like to work on these things. But I fulfilled my test taking quota for life. So no.
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): xD but if theyre paying you....
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): the employement counselor has me taking personality tests as if i havent already taken ever single test out there lmao.

Theyre trying to help me narrow down my options, but if i decide to go back to school my tuition is waived for like the first year or so
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): so like thats kinda appealing ...but at the same time  ***SCHOOL***
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: maybe a technical degree??
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: and damn wow yeah NY doesnt give you help like that
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): tbh my issue is that everything i WANT to do is like a 4yr+ degree
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): and anything id settle for is like....shit pay
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): or like horrible hours
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: same but maybe pick something could be good at instead of 'super want'
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: or uh. idk go to mortuary school
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: thats a 2yr degree
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: certification thing
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): would that allow me to embalm myself
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): because

Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): WOO
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): good for her
