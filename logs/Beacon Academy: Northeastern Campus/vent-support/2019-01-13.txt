Evie (Katheryne Knight): WOW OKAY UM
MY BLOOD PRESSURE JUST SKYROCKETED I'M MAD
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's a fucking death treat like what the everloving fuck.

Straight Incel Fuckboi Broflakes are fucking cancled.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also this guys is such a little fucking edgelord because PoH is an anime character from SOA who is the leader of a pLayer killing guild.


So he's telling Casey to get killed by an anime character from a subpar anime. 

my mind is a fucking mess right now I can't like this bitch is cancled.
Matt (mattmyers25): I reported him
Evie (Katheryne Knight): This guy is a fucking cuck smh
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Ye I thought I recognized the name.
Jess (whoozica): This guy has some serious issues
ZombieHunter: IS THAT WHAT POH IS?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP
Mark (Mad Doctor): Shit like this didn't happen when I was young. There were too many shattered bodies and shattered families from the last time hatred was allowed to be a ruling ideology. Guys like this think "triggering libs" is just cause for whatever hate they put forward. They see any response as evidence of their own virtue, and now they think the powers that be have their back. It has all happened before, and it leads to ruin.  Y'all keep up the good fight. Keep bending the arc of history to justice, and I'll be right alongside you.
