Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i have been made the victim of a practical joke. a prank. i think.
someone gave me a brochure saying they picked it up for me because i'd find it useful, and the front just says "stripping made easier" and i died inside. but it's about paint and varnish stripping. i'm still dead inside though i can't overcome that ordeal so quickly.
