Anna (loud and likely blonde): Mag woke up and took out her contacts and can't see so uhhhhh imma be awol for the next fordeeable anything
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Omg üò± she fell asleep with them in??
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeah it's happened before but I have no idea what went wrong this time and like current vison is like 10% of normal so she's freaking out. 
She's currently asleep on floor cause she doesn't wanna go to the ER so we gonna see if her vision is better in a few hours bc there's really nothing we can do right now and they wouldn't be able to do anything at the ER anyways
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I think it's just temporarily warped her cornea plus panic attack plus dehydrated
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea give her some water, let her rest a bit but also just keep an eye on her and keep us updated. Holy shit that's so scary. üò±üò≠
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeah like top ten fears
Anna (loud and likely blonde): She's sleeping again tho so I'm hoping for best
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I hope things get better. If you guys need help getting to first aid or to the hospital then just hmu
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ‚ù§Ô∏è
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Slight humor for this bc idk how to cope normally: now I said she was literally Aizawa but I didn't mean the almost going blind part I TAKE IT BACK I TAKE IT BACK
