Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like i gained a third of my weight in a year and I need to watch what I eat to figure out if that's what caused it ooorrr if it's soemthing medically wrong. I don't think it's food cause I ate like this my whole life but oof even so i still need to manage what I eat better cause I eat like crap. Especially when rushing betwene school and work..
Georgia (Something Sensible): _not filling tho_
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *hormones*

Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: late to the chat

Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: astrology
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *And now its an irisu syndrome kind of morning*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Fuck... I misread the instructions for my one radio project so I didn't do it fully right it seems... Gonna see if I can redo it quick this weekend so don't have to be the only student coming in during finals to do my final project in this class 😦
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙃 so like half my finals next week are at 2:45pm... I usually work at 3:30pm. My schedule is probably already made but now gonna have to go in and see if I can move shit around cause half my damn teachers didn't say when finals were until this week... ughh. Thank god my boss is nice and easy to work with 😭
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I mean, your boss should know that school is a priority so hopefully that shouldn't be too much of a problem
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee she easy to work with thankfully. She'll jokingly give me a hard time probs but she'll work it out with me. I'm basically just gonna ask her if need be to move like an hour or 30 mins around to other days when don't have finals. So not losing hours. Like I should be okay but just don't want to risk running late or rushing a final lol. Would be nice if not scheduled till later so don't have to buuuttt we shall see when I go in lol.
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: What the fuck how did your school not tell you when your finals were
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cause they don't have their shit together. This semesters been rough. Like no one has their shit together faculty wise this semester. I've been having to go on manhunts to get attention from anyone for important shit 😑
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: ~~my school deadass had to have finals set by the start of class~~
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: like. semester
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think some did but like msot dont. Half of them are like we will let you know closer to, we cant disclose at this time... like im sorry what
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: they were set by time slot of the class so like every MWF 8-9 AM had the test X day at Y time
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): w o t rebecca u should fight them
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): temple japan had the finals set in stone by the first day of class (for masters, for undergrad i noticed they would pin a sign up with the times a few months beforehand), and rowan would send out e-mails around mid-semester of when and where the finals would be
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: yea u just have to set a hit list
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷 MU's been a shit show for me this semester. I've been mad stressed out the past several weeks cause shit going on. Like people wont get back to me on things so I've been having to manhunt them down
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like just reply to my damn emailsss
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also lol im even more frustrated now cause my mom and I chatted and now I'm okay to go until next spring to graduate so I dont have to take summer classes... Wtfff. So dropped 2 but may keep 2? Idk yet
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I accidentally made a typo when text my boss and I'd like to crawl in a hole now.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh no
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): It wasn't too bad. They changed my schedule a bit and I was in between deciding whether to say "no problem" and "thank you". It came out "no thank you'.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im dead
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I corrected a minute later but I still feel like dying just a bit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmaooo XD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Like I genuinely didn't mean to sass, but I think my subconscious annoyance from being cut another hour this week after work really early shifts all week came out.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351> I'm not schedule till 5 on the day my 2:45 final is. Ohhh bless.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't need to change anything that I'm aware of
