Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wish my one friend would get an Instagram so I can @ him in shit when I find his pic from the con instead of having to screen shot 😫
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lmao i just found out he has made an insta upon sending it. OOPS~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So talking about school work uuhhh... my professor handed us an essay assignment to do last Tues and I don't recall her saying the due date nor does it say on paper but looking on our course page on D2L... it's due this Tues :X Guess imma be banging out a fucking essay tomorrow night.. dammit
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Thank god I've already written fucking like 3 essays on this comm theory so hopefully I can get it banged out quickly~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): It's so windy I feel like I'm being blown off the face of the Earth rn
Mark (Mad Doctor): I have bus duty in the morning. I've been saying "I'm Mary Poppins, y'all" all day
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is that cause your face froze off?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cause I'm going to fly away like the delicate flower I am
Anna (loud and likely blonde): holy crap it only took an extra several days to get paid
the company my company uses for payroll had outages for some reason. so we didnt get paid on thursday. Except like *i need that for rent so pls n thank*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): >.< I keep oversleeping a bit too much that I miss making it to this class on time... Dammit. I need to get my shit together
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I love when my one boss ignores emails that cost him potential business 🙃
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Not that I really care because the job we were quoting would have required us to buy two tools we don't have at about $2k each
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It just makes us look bad
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Again, not that I *really* care.... but he should since he's the owner
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Seems like we're all having just a "great" Monday.. 🙃
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A big mood ^
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~and im still fucking sick~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Some car from out of state with fully tinted windows keeps driving by the bus stop full of kids 🙃
Marisa (Mawisa): Same anna
We suffer
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao welllll the Starbucks I was in just lot power for a second O.o
Marisa (Mawisa): Apocalypse now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao it's only 9:30am today sucks. Let's all say fuck it and go home XD
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that was a good movie marisa
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~i just wanna be home but idk what i would do at home besides panic~~
Marisa (Mawisa): That sounds good
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😮 why would you panic if home?
Marisa (Mawisa): You’d think the police would come a little faster when we ask them to check out this super suspicious car seeing as we’ve had major issues like a prostitution ring and a guy who’d sit in his car doing gross stuff when people walked by but nah
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yoo wtf. People are fucking awful O.o
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee hurry up Po Po.. check out that weirdo car. Protecto peoples
Marisa (Mawisa): Anna we protec u
Marisa (Mawisa): U saw my muscles I’ll punch for u
Marisa (Mawisa): 💪
Anna (loud and likely blonde): anxiety
Anna (loud and likely blonde): anxiety is why i panic
Anna (loud and likely blonde): bc if i home i no work
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and if i no work i no get paid
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and pANIC
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahh truuuu
Anna (loud and likely blonde): also can someone tell me. why i gotta look through the most thrown together zoning code which is barely a zoning code before i can go read a good one
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh wait cause village for some reason overrides town jurisdiction which overrides county which overrides state which etc
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *did you know 'aesthetically objectional' is apparently a type of hazard according to NYC*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'd believe that tho.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): today on i hate long island: Having to hunt through a town code to find out that one map lied and actually a property belongs to a different village entirely and you did your zoning wrong
Marisa (Mawisa): That’s like the plot to a puzzle game
Marisa (Mawisa): I just watched a video of myself and why do I wink so much 
I don’t mean to wink every 5 seconds I didn’t even know I did that so often <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Marisa (Mawisa): ‘‘Tis not a conscious effort
Anna (loud and likely blonde): its a shitty puzzle game i just spent almost two hours on this bull.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): why is the town name in ur address not the town name that its in
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *why did i grow up with an address for one town but my property actually belonged to another*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh same.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): tbh it wasnt annoying except for voting cause we had to go to the other town hall. the school district actually came into the other town so i went to the school in a town i didnt live in
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Always fun signing legal documents. "Do you want my actual town or mailing address".
Marisa (Mawisa): Oh we do that!! Our address has the wrong town because we use another towns post office or something
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): my town is too small for a post office
Marisa (Mawisa): no mail
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We just use the next town over.
Marisa (Mawisa): No fair I winked
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh that's called blinking, by the way.
Marisa (Mawisa): But with one eye??
Marisa (Mawisa): I intend to blink but only one eye actually does it. People have pointed it out in conversation but I didn’t think it was this bad <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Jess (whoozica): do your eyes get irritated alot?
Marisa (Mawisa): Ye like 24/7
Jess (whoozica): i wink alot when i wear my contacts if they start to get dry
Jess (whoozica): thats prob why them
Jess (whoozica): your prob only blinking the eye thats feeling irritated at that time
Marisa (Mawisa): Nah I think one eye is just more messed up than the other but I dunno why. That’s the eye that cries more when it’s cold or sunny or cold and sunny
Marisa (Mawisa): Water your contacts jess
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~when the survey has the wrong section on it like thanks!!~~
Marisa (Mawisa): Nice teamwork
Erik (Red Riot Thot): makes the dream work
Anna (loud and likely blonde): This zoning code just ignores that gas stations exist in this villiage. are gas stations just not allowed
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everytime you say village I think of some D&D hamlet.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Well I was going to try to start on this essay now but I'm getting a migraine it seems and my eyesight is fucked up >.<
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oof it’s so windy today that I had to put my hair under my backpack to not get caught in a blonde tornado
ZombieHunter: I don’t wanna go out there. It’s scary.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Our marking period ends this Thursday. Two kids in my senior elective still have not handed in papers that were due two weeks ago. They've been accepted to college and lack motivation. Apparently the zero I'm going to enter in my grade book and the possible revocation of their college acceptance based on the F they get isn't motivation enough...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Marisa (Mawisa): 
Mark (Mad Doctor): I feel bad. They're nice kids. There are some I wouldn't mind screwing up their lives, but not these lazy schmucks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I second Marisa's post... Then perish lol. Nothing you can really do. They're being lazy and screwing over themselves
Jess (whoozica): Boss: "what are you working on?"
Me; *makes up some bullshit*
Boss: "ok ill give this to someone else to do"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): :dab: on coworker's corpse.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): work has kind of been slowing down so I've been looking into creating a new DnD character lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: doo ittt
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Everyone's talking DnD recently 😫 I wanna learn to play it so bad lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It's soooooo much fun!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): God I'm in love with my character from my current campaign
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah someone came into my tellonym like "tabletop games owo?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): and i was like FECK I WISH
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I saw the one from Hal's Tellonym about a RWBY tabletop RPG and it reminded me of whem Mark said he wanted to do something like that. That would be sweet
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'd still love to run that...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's looks like a lot of fun. I always thought it looked cool but didn't know anyone who played until recently. Now I'm just sitting here staring at  y'all who do like OwO lemme join y'all and learn to play lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): hello i would like my character to be pyrrha but not dead, that is all
Georgia (Something Sensible): we could do a one-shot D&D night at my house!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Undead Pyrrha? Done
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I loveee D&D
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I is a bard
Mark (Mad Doctor): Heh, I'm a halfling rogue who recently swapped subspecies and gender thanks to a capricious reincarnation spell. I'm evolving from recklessly suicidal nihilism  to responsible leader of my people
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): responsible means lining up for tossing correct.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I'm an aasimar Bard with 17 charisma at level 1
+5 Persuasion and Deception cause Imma sneaky feck
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~now i just need a game to use it in~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Last i played (2 years ago?) i was an aasimar fighter with stupid dexterity and charisma and nothing else lmao
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wasn't that the stupid game with Austin...?
Georgia (Something Sensible): nah i used a throwaway character for that
Georgia (Something Sensible): ugh that was the worst
Georgia (Something Sensible): ethan kept rolling to seduce his teammates
Georgia (Something Sensible): and i wAS LIKE THERE IS A _DRAGON SIR_
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm a wood elf druid
Georgia (Something Sensible): I read that as "wolf elf" at first
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *You should not be able to do something ridiculous just because you passed a skill check, QED*
Marisa (Mawisa): i was a cleric named eric
Georgia (Something Sensible): and i was like ok furry <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Mawisa get on it*
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: WHY DIDN'T HE ROLL TO SEDUCE THE DRAGON
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ||ugh playing DnD with Ethan...||
Georgia (Something Sensible): _because apparently ethan isnt a scaley_
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: _who cares if you succeed you get a dragon as your buddy__
Georgia (Something Sensible): more precisely fuckbuddy i guess but yeah idk
Georgia (Something Sensible): misplaced priorities
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): can we actually do dnd at georgias some time, because my only experience with it was with ethan and i feel like that was a bad introduction
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: If donkey can do it so can I
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I befriended and tamed a dire wolf that was attacking us. I named him Sparky
Erik (Red Riot Thot): He's a good boi
Georgia (Something Sensible): are you secretly an instinct pokemon trainer
Georgia (Something Sensible): and YEAH LEANNA i would so do that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Physics disagrees~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): HELL YEA <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Georgia (Something Sensible): physics can eat a butt
Georgia (Something Sensible): i take that back
Georgia (Something Sensible): physics can take a vacation
Georgia (Something Sensible): i would have a free weekend in april if ethan didnt ask me to plan that welcome back party...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he... asked you.... to plan
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don't bait me into saying my opinion publicly.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: is he moving back?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://tenor.com/view/hopeless-disappointed-ryan-reynolds-facepalm-embarrassed-gif-5436796
Georgia (Something Sensible): n o p e
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: is casey?
Georgia (Something Sensible): he and casey are just visiting
Georgia (Something Sensible): but he asked me to throw a welcome back party
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~then why is it a welcome back party~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): _exactly_
Georgia (Something Sensible): and thats when hes probably gonna peacock around about their wedding next summer
Georgia (Something Sensible): which is even MORE frustrating
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: oh god they're getting married?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: question how do you do that black out thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): he also called me to ask me if it was okay if austin is my "designated groomsman" partner person
Erik (Red Riot Thot): || TEXT ||
Georgia (Something Sensible): and hes inviting Tarik
Marisa (Mawisa): ||spoilers?||
Erik (Red Riot Thot): | |  TEXT  | |
Erik (Red Riot Thot): REMOVE SPACES
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Umm
Georgia (Something Sensible): _theyre not spoilers everyone should know how bad the situation is_
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: you have a boyfriend don't you
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: shouldn't that be your groomsman
Georgia (Something Sensible): well traditionally the bridesmaid is paired up with a groomsman for the night
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ||they asked me to be caseys maid of honor and im 😬||
Georgia (Something Sensible): eugh typing that feels gross
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ||HE ASKED ME TO OFFICIATE||
Marisa (Mawisa): but they don't know noah do they. usually they pair the bridesmans and the yeah that
Georgia (Something Sensible): ERIK WHAT
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ||its not spoilers but lets be real it adds a great tension to it||
Georgia (Something Sensible): nope ethan knows noah
Georgia (Something Sensible): which makes this THAT MUCH MORE AWKWARD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh dear
Georgia (Something Sensible): hes like "aw yeah i like your bass boyfriend" and im like ~~ok why pair me with austin then~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Usually the bride chooses her maids, the groom chooses his men, they get paired up based on different factors, but they don't have to pick your SO for their wedding party
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah but theres usually like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: some form of respect
Georgia (Something Sensible): well austin was particularly problematic cause he tried to get all touchy feely at RTC 2017
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yimes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ||ok but did casey actually pick?||
Georgia (Something Sensible): doubt it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh god yikes
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ||then again its ethan and respecting women isn't his thing||
Georgia (Something Sensible): i love you leanna but i feel like ethan chose the maid of honor
Georgia (Something Sensible): im shocked casey didnt choose any of her high school friends
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i said that to them
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i said
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "would casey want georgia?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): <:lenny:456549338026344489> ive only known casey 5 years and would be most qualified to plan things
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Does casey still think that they're mini break up was your idea
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://giphy.com/gifs/mrw-imgur-pictures-EZYQjm1uPrXGg
Marisa (Mawisa): she's in the server right we could ping her
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She is, so keep that in mind folks.
Marisa (Mawisa): this is what i like to see
Georgia (Something Sensible): i wish casey was in the server more :😭
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's not a judgement on anyone, just keep in mind the internet is not as private as we think.
Georgia (Something Sensible): the tension with ethan is lowkey well known now
Marisa (Mawisa): lets ask our assigned fbi agents their opinion
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Ethan already hates me and last I checked casey takes his side in relation to me so like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats why the guest list that ethan gave me is like 5 people long
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO

Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Around rtx? That way people will have a reason to come down
Georgia (Something Sensible): _im dropping 300 dollars to lock arms with a creep and punch a cheater in the teeth_
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~it would lowkey be more cost effective to have it up here~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah he wants it the weekend before or after RTX
Georgia (Something Sensible): but also like... who can get off that long
Erik (Red Riot Thot): not I
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~it would highkey be cheaper to do it in NJ~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not me fam
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~what to do is tell him no ffs~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Blame school, it's easy.

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): its the only option
Erik (Red Riot Thot): steal the bride
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and the groom has to find her
Erik (Red Riot Thot): in NJ
Georgia (Something Sensible): they didnt redo a proposal either or anythin
Georgia (Something Sensible): i guess they just ... i dont even know
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~then get together with Casey and don't put yourself out for a party you're being asked for~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😰
Georgia (Something Sensible): but ethan makes her happy oof
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~at least they put in more effort than my ex when she tied the knot after she broke off our engagement~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Actually, I can't with this stuff. Too much niceties given to someone who treats ya'll poorly.
Georgia (Something Sensible): and theyre kind of attached at the hip

Georgia (Something Sensible): GOSH idk
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: fair
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: cons are p bad
Georgia (Something Sensible): id rather see 100 con creeps than the wombo-combo that is austin and tarik
Georgia (Something Sensible): _my love for casey is really being tested_
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~If he doesn't give you a plus one to bring boyfriend think carefully, that's worrying situation far from home~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Granted I worry about you more than I should.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~to be fair your worrying is usually warranted~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): plz bill, noah won the hunger games, he would be fiiiine
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Idk that's a reasonable amount of worry in this
Georgia (Something Sensible): they have to give the wedding party the +1 dont the?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): do we teach your boyfriend how to fight with a knife
Georgia (Something Sensible): those are like the VIPs
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Noah is not the question, not having Noah there is.
Georgia (Something Sensible): anna do you... do you know that?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~if theyre sensible ive seen some weird ass weddings~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): uhhhhhhh
Anna (loud and likely blonde): maybeeeee
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Georgia listens to my worrying. Most of the time. I have white knight syndrome tho so I can overdo it my side though.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *listen i grew up in the middle of nowhere im pretty sure i know how to operate way too many pieces of machinery and how to use too many sharp objects*
Georgia (Something Sensible): anna, noah faints at the sight of blood, do you want to be my rent-a-boyfriend
Georgia (Something Sensible): we'll get you a 'stache and everything
Anna (loud and likely blonde): thats fine we just teach you to fight 
~~altho i wont turn down mustache~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): anna be like: "ah yes i am [squints at hand] Moses. oh fuck wrong one."
Anna (loud and likely blonde): guess i gotta build a boat now too
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so anyways you can take a knife on a plane if its in your checked baggage
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've got a drawer full of swiss army knives, I got you covered.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): one for each member of the wedding party?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so... like 2
Anna (loud and likely blonde): turns out my favorite knife is not legal in the state i live in
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~oh no we arent going GoT on this wedding~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): leanna did you say youd go?
Georgia (Something Sensible): cause my apprehension is very much growing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i didnt really give a yes or no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i was kinda like "im honored but i have to think about it"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😬
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and just yeeted away
Georgia (Something Sensible): i want toooooo cancel on throwing this welcome back party
Georgia (Something Sensible): im dreading it

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~can we host a dnd, welcome back CASEY party~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): dunkin donuts, dnd, and casey
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): sounds ultimately like a better time

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): He's bitter he left, and too prideful to want back in.
Jamie (Jamie): ~~wait do you think rooster  teeth has heard of us then?~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao doubtful
Chris Onyx: Ethan just talks shit cause hes a shitty person
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No one should pay him any mind, nor let him affect your day.
Matt (mattmyers25): Bne takes over the party
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): VALID
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We don't even fucking *do anything* to be exclusive about.
Mark (Mad Doctor): On a related note, are there people in the area to whom we should extend an invitation?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We don't have at con meetups.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh I am sure there are lol
Matt (mattmyers25): Side note: when are we all seeing each other again that's not a con?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: As a comment on the clique-y thing 
I wouldn't doubt it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): who the fuck knows lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i mean ethans word is worth shit
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: this is a big group of people who regularly will work and interact with eachother online, and not as much as with other people
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: theres gonna be people who see that as cliquey
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Valid
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: also ngl
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: we are a bit clique-y
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): to be fair..... ive heard similar things about "the delaware crew" but like... i know ya'll and i know you guys arent like that so i pay no mind to it
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah no i know
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like -big shrug-
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its just what happens when you have a group
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee it is sadly
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think anyone who meets us at cons knows we're not clique-y
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: there isn't something inherently wrong with having a 'clique' either
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: its only bad if you use the clique to actively ostracize people
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: or bully
Marisa (Mawisa): proof that we aren't clique-y is that i'd walk past 90% of you at a con and have no idea who you are oops
Mark (Mad Doctor): If the social dynamic of the group is to foster elitism and exlusionary policies, then it's a problem. Don't think that's an issues here
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Correct. We’ve never refused anyone.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~the only ppl i can see being salty are people who arent friendly or welcoming and are looking at you like an instagram profile to use to climb popularity instead of as friends~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ^
Mark (Mad Doctor): Now if people feel excluded, chances are they are to shy to ask to join, or we're too clueless to notice that they want in. Which is why I asked if there were people we should invite
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. We are always welcoming and inviting new people to join our little group group and discord here to chat about shows, cosplay and etc. As well as get to be closer to one another
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Also question who is the delaware crew btw
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: cause i hear that and like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I don't get who it refers too
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: is it just meghan lissy and me?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: cause we're the only delaware people
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Mak when she's not at college
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Idk but like wtf? Of course ya'll gonna be close and do shit together a LOT cause ya'll live near each other O.o
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: is 3 people enough to be a clique
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It tends to include Brandon and Tyler too, even though that’s totally wrong and they’re in PA.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like damn.. people be crazy. Ohh nooo they're cliquey cause they do stuff together and no one else... well duuuhhh... you're gonna do more stuff with people who live closer to you. Doesn't mean you're cliquey...
Mark (Mad Doctor): North Delaware
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Brandon Tyler and there group are all from like PA and New Jersey
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: literally over an hour away from the DE state line
Marisa (Mawisa): how dare you be so close
Rebecca (madameterralupus): People just try to dig for reasons to whine and bitch 🤷 I'd pay no mind to it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Isn't Mak in DE too?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: they don't even come to delaware like ever
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah Maks from DE
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: but like 70% of the year shes at Towson in Maryland
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea "the delaware crew" is usually referring to anyone who ends up in brandon and tylers hotels at cons?? at least thats what ive been hearing?? 

i don't really understand how it became  "the delaware crew" but -shrugs-
Mark (Mad Doctor): Delaware Valley?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): first name given just stuck.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s pretty normal.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But yeah, if I say "Delaware crew" I'm *usually* just referring to Hal, Meg, and Lissy, but it's not like, in a clique-y way? It's just that y'all are from DE and are close and hang out frequently. But like, I don't mean any negative connotation with it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hotel rooms do tend to form groups.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but its literally just people think a large group of friends is a "clique" and is  "exclusive" even if we all are super welcoming and try to make friends with everyone in sight xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Again, people just want to find a reason to whine and bitch over stupid stuff
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: lol Tyler and Brandons Hotel room is a regular revolving door of people who enjoy booze and partying
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): especially in the cosplay community.... unfortunately. unneeded drama over ...having friends
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): This isn’t “people” saying it. It’s ETHAN.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s it.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Important point
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And I don’t want to see this group dwell on the opinion of somehow who blatantly insulted BNE after leaving.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I would just like to state I've noticed most people start rumors because of jealousy soo...~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~ethan and his problematic friends who have been outcasted for doing really sketch things.......such as stalking other cosplayers, or underage girls~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Big yikes.~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not a big deal in my book, lmao. none of us are doing anything wrong
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Correct* and I hate to see there opinions being discussed like they’re valid.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~how dare they be a clique and kick out the toxic people who are creeps~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We’ve never kicked anyone.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~wait those people left on their own~~
Matt (mattmyers25): ~~the more I hear about Ethan the less I like him. Can I kick him in the ball?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ethan left.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: ~~STILL THEIR FAULT~~
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah I know
Mark (Mad Doctor): It never hurts a group to look critically at itself. Just to make sure we uphold the values we profess
Jamie (Jamie): yeaa i feel bad for people who are targeted cause oh theyre friends with super popular cosplayer\person but someone tries to start rumors against them that they're just friends for popularity. like damn when those stories find their way to me im like wow okay
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: he got upsetti spaghetti cause I said austin is very democrat leaning
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and left
Mark (Mad Doctor): Really?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: oh yeah
Chris Onyx: Ethan's just a butt boy
We don't gotta worry about him
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh wow i didnt know that was the reasoning 😂
Mark (Mad Doctor): It's like the People's Republic of Texas
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the day he left Riley mentioned being worried about being in texas cause like
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: people they know and its super red
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa. I remember him getting heated with Hal over something political
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): OOF
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): good riddance
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: and I was like "don't worry the cities are super accepting and Austin in particular is blue af"
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: then he got upset saying I was attack texas or something
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee I kinda recall this too.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: i can go back and find it later
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It kinda erupted really quickly over something small if I recall correctly
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: 
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ||||
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Ey erik nice timing lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: he left shortly after that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee it like blew up really quickly over some small comment
Marisa (Mawisa): i assume that's ethan?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah X-19 is Ethan
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes
Marisa (Mawisa): yikes
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hal, you gave a textbook example of how to apologise for giving offense
Jamie (Jamie): oh shit yea i remember now he was a cause for random drama in the chats more than once
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: yeah ngl it wasn't the best apology i could give but like
Anna (loud and likely blonde): jfc talk about mountain out of a molehill
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh rip i remember this now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that was ridiculous
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: the level of offense he expressed felt like he just wanted to bait me into stupid drama
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yep
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: so I just wanted to give my apology and move along.
Mark (Mad Doctor): And you didn't try to rationalize or justify your words. Anyone still pissy after that is looking for a fight
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: tbh the only offensive thing in all that is that I was assuming rei was concerned about discrimination in texas
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: which is an overt generalization of everybody i guess
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean Ethan had a vendetta for Hal anyways to begin with
Georgia (Something Sensible): So that obviously played a role
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: I still don't get why he had a vendetta against me from the beginning
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Alright. This is not a judgement on anyone, but this has taken to be a very strong brew of Tea and Ethan’s fiancée is completely able to read this. In interest of her feelings, I’d recommend everyone taking a break, be it to DMs or just as a breather.
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: fair
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *time for me to vent about work FUCK SUFFOLK COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): JESUS FUCK CAN ANY OF THEM READ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): O.o
Anna (loud and likely blonde): they say 'dimension and show leaching pools as X min from property line' bitch we DID
Matt (mattmyers25): They arent smart
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Oops
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): @here This statement goes for everyone, including myself. We deleted the prior vent-support channel out of respect for Casey's feelings. It would hurt her to read us commenting and dragging on her fiancee and we should have known better than to do so. I'm not going to say something like we shouldn't gossip, we all do and we're not going to stop anytime soon. There is simply a time and a place for such commentary and we choose poorly to do so in a public chat effectively in front of someone who cares deeply for that person. Acting like that will make Ethan's statement true about us, that we are catty and unwelcoming. I for one do not think of BNE in that manner and I believe no one else here does. We are a fine, supportive community of friends who exist to hold each other up, not tear someone down. I intend to do better, and hope everyone will rise to that challenge as well. 

I'll be clearing this message in a little while, and giving Casey read access to this channel after that.
Matt (mattmyers25): 1st lol
Marisa (Mawisa): nooOO
Marisa (Mawisa): NOO I TABBED AWAY FOR ONE SECOND I wanted to be first

Anna (loud and likely blonde): they say that my profile shows 12' effective depth
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Work can go suck 👏 it 👏
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and my math shows 10'
Anna (loud and likely blonde): but i dont show 12 anywhere on my profile

Mark (Mad Doctor): Currently I teach two sections of seniors. My department head came to me and asked permission for me to give up one of them. Teach half as many lazy entitled  goof-offs? Yes, please.
