Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’ve been up since 5:30 help
Matt (mattmyers25): You need coffee
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Today is gonna suuuuck
Both managers are off and it’s just me and my other two co-workers >_<

I had coffee >_<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I just gotta put my game face on and hopefor the best
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Less than two months I’ll be able to come home to snuggles and hugs every day ^_^
Erik (slendergiant): So I made an account for that charity I got suckered into pledging to and it finally linked my payment info so I emailed them to at least reduce the donation amount.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You can't cancel it? There should be a way to do so somewhere.
Erik (slendergiant): I probably could, but like, it *is* a good cause and I don't mind giving something to it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): True. But like giving so much monthly is gonna add up.
Erik (slendergiant): Like I want to reduce it to $5/month which amounts in a year to about what I'd give for a one-time donation
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm that'd be more reasonable. Hopefully they can work it out to decrease the amount. Cause yeaa $20 is a hell of a lot... ~~I think that's what she said the amount was~~
Erik (slendergiant): Yo so one of the companies I interviewed with last year just contacted me saying they never ended up filling the position (they didn't pursue me because I was overqualified) so they revamped the position and asked if I was still interested 😱
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oh wow nicu
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good luck. You deserve a good job
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh nice!! Good luck! 🤗
Erik (slendergiant): Might require a pay cut, but it might be a foot in the door to where I want to be going in my career
Erik (slendergiant): It's honestly not a whole lot of engineering and honestly is more graphic and 3D design (which, face it, that's more my forte than actual engineering work)
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ahh that'd suck. But as long as you are enjoying what you are doing and happy is what matters more. You can always make the difference up later with raises. And oh really? 😦
Erik (slendergiant): And from what I remember, they really seemed to like me
Erik (slendergiant): If I got it I'd be moving out towards Harrisburg, so <@!229713389511901185> waddup
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Well that's good 😃 
And lol you'd be living near Matt too
Mark (Mad Doctor): Beacon West-by-Northeast
ZombieHunter: Don’t mean to be super political or anything
ZombieHunter: But current politics are really shaking me to my core.
ZombieHunter: Just. Vote. Please. Everyone cuz as it is I feel like by next year I’ll be on the list of some kind of witch hunt
Mark (Mad Doctor): For decades, I was officially neutral in my classes, trying to give both sides equal time. I can't do that anymore.  The president and his close supporters want to build their power on the most vulnerable people in our society. I don't want to be the guy that didn't speak up.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): <@!386874959009415170>  OH SHIT WHADDUP FAM?!
COME OVER FOR COSCRAFTING WEEKENDS
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Ya’ll are welcome for that just so ya knows

ZombieHunter: <@!386567060026556417>  that’s a beautiful way to handle it
