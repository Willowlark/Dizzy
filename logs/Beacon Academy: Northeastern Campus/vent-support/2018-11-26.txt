Georgia (Something Sensible): The heat in my suite STILL isn’t working
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Did anyone ever come to look at or fix it?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Guess not!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): >Me: Just bought over  two hundred dollars worth of costumes and wigs this weekend when sales were running...
>Me now: Okay I am done spending until the weekend comes, imma go broke. I need to get christmas gifts
>Rooster teeth has a cyber monday sale for shirts even cheaper now
>Me: Fuuuu I need the Raven and Seamonkeys tee
Jess (whoozica): what a mood
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): thanks for telling me this sale exists; I needed to spend money today.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😎 👌 Ya welcome Bill lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~we can both spend monies and treat ourselves~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> The main one I want is out of stock NUUUUUU
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There's not that much on sale.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Less motivated.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was mostly motivated cause $15 tees so I could get the two I've been wanting for a while... but now my size in the Raven one is out of stick and I'm very less motivated now to actually buy anything 😭
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Shipping basically makes it full price kappa.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You right lol. Shipping cost is high :\ which sucks
Jess (whoozica): id but the nora longsleeve if it had a hood
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea idk why it doesn't have a hood like the others. Like 2 of those designs are hoodies and the other 2 are long sleeves?? O.o
Jess (whoozica): RT: "All T-Shirts $15!"
Also RT: RWBY Nora's Workout T-Shirt:  $19.99
Jess (whoozica): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤔
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yea why are the shirts that have been on sale for a while higher in price than the cyber monday sale shirts... doesnt make sense XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lol okay I was bad and bought two shirts, oops XD~~

Jess (whoozica): i really wish nora had one of these varsity tees cuz they ate KYOOT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right?! They need to make more of those varsity tees for other characters. I have 3 of them and I *love* them. Theyre super light weight and comfy.
Jess (whoozica): they look so nice! i like yangs i think, dat color is nice and bright
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm it is XD I have that one, weiss and Blake's so far :3
I'd buy them all if they made them for other characters XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): @roosteteeth most of your merch sucks and it’s too repetitive. Hire me I design you better shit. Please and thank you
Jess (whoozica): MOOD

Jess (whoozica): DAS OK own it gurl
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was watching RWBYRW and Shannon called them out for never having any Ozpin merch lol

meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): They have merch for ADAM FUCKING TAURUS but not ozpin 🙄
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They have merch for *Neon*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They need merch of him, more of for like strq members since being more prominent and JNR lol
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, I don't expect any Taiyang merch unless he becomes more relevant, but even a vinyl emblem would be nice
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Tru. Also can we get some more stuff for Qrow and Raven though?? Like Qrow's been more relevant for a while now. He only has like 3 items merch? And Raven is a maiden and im sure gonna be more relevant at some point can we get more than a shirt XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Roosterteeth is stuck huffing team rwby fumes so well prob just get more merch for them tbh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): RT make a sticker or shirt for at least every chara you create please?? <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> Share the love to all, don't just select 6 characters to constantly make new merch for XD
Marisa (Weeb): i have fnki stickers :3c

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Awww that's so cute Marisa~

Marisa (Weeb): you say that now and then after the 10th sticker you'll be like "i don't even know these characters when will this end"
