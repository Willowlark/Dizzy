Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay so does anyone know this person?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): All they do is comment the same thing on all my stuff
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like it‚Äôs cool
But it‚Äôs the same comment
On almost all my recent posts
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And idk if I‚Äôm missing a hint or...
Marisa (Weeb): Do you follow them? Sometimes people comment on stuff in hopes that the person who sees it repeatedly will follow them back
Marisa (Weeb): Oh it looks like a reposting blog too so it‚Äôs possibly a bit
Marisa (Weeb): ~~everybody start commenting the same thing on every image go~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I don‚Äôt
But that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs one of those Imstas that just repost
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So this one guy in my class hasn't shown up for *weeks*. We had a group presentation to do that I replaced him in the group for because I missed the group making day and would have been on my own other wise (and he wasnt show up obvs). The one guy in my group was like wouldn't it be funny if he showed up today.... welp guess who finally showed back up ü§î
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And even if you credit people, I‚Äôm not a fan of reposters 

Because despite the credit, people just like and scroll and don‚Äôt even bother to look at the ‚Äú@‚Äú
