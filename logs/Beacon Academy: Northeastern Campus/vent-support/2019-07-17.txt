Rebecca (madameterralupus): I... why am I like this xD hoarding costumes
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: oh throw weiss in the pile of stuff for me i told u id try to fix it lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Eh I think imma just sell her. It's Vol 1 and I'd rather do Vol 2.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thanks though xD
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: thats a mood
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: are you in the anime cosplay buy sell trade group on fb?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee I am. And oof I'm stress cause there's some costumes I wanna keep but like don't really have a use to wear them anymore? Like no one to wear with, haven't worn in a while, etc.. but I love...
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: yea same. I think its still better to part with them though cause if you have them and dont wear them, your skills to do them are probs better now
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: ~~what ones do u not have ppl to do things with tho~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee. Like I may keep parts? But ehhh. And lol main one is Holo from Spice and Wolf.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I like being her but ehh no Lawrence anymore and idk. I might keep just tail/ears and get rid of rest?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: id keep the acessories and sell or donate the rest. I feel you though. I dont have anyone for when i wear Pyro, Engie (hes mostly retired anyways) or Elizabeth. Like i wanted to make a splicer but also again, dont know anyone who does bioshock
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~keep the furry parts for future fursona~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao Leannaaaa xDD
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i mean. theyre not wrong
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And yeee most costumes shoved in back of closet are ones I had matching with people of past. Sooo I think they gotta go .-.
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: clean slate

Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: seriously though uhhhhhhhhhhh you might have to yell at me bc im now considering a splicer for katsu

Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: YES GOOD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I also have a cowboy hate I bought to beehaw... but never did xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~why am I such a hoarder. Fuck~~
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: bc we look at something and go OH I CAN USE THIS LATER IF I EVER DO XYZ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yep! And then it sits there for years xD
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: y e p
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i do that with makeup and its rlly bad cause that expires
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh same. I have tons of makeup... I dont even wear it on a daily basis and like never wear half of it. I always use the same few products XD
Mark (Mad Doctor): Of course the week of con crunch has off the charts humidity. I think PA should designate the second week in May as spray painting season
