Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙄 I have a group presentation due at 12:30 and several of the slides on the presentation are empty... Hopefully whoever those belong to gets it done in time so we don't get points off..
Marisa (Mawisa): omg that's messed up. hurry up person.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm so ready to be done with this group tbh.
ZombieHunter: >.> apparently dating makes me nervous so I panic. 

This girl got drunk cuz she didn’t know how to get her point across and hit on me.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof a big mood. Dating makes me nervous anymore too.  Don't panic too much though, it'll all be okay. Just breathe and be yourself.
And ohh yikes O.o
Marisa (Mawisa): was the date last night, or was it just now? it's morning right?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yee it's 9:47am here lol
Marisa (Mawisa): wow a drunk morning date
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Oof it feels like it should be later... RIP being up so early~~
Marisa (Mawisa): it's almost midnight so there u go. late.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I always joke about how my sleep schedule and time zones are off and I'm always on like Russian or Japanese time XDD ~~
ZombieHunter: No like I was asked on a date and woops
ZombieHunter: 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ohh so you haven't had the date yet, you were just asked on one so far but found out she was drunk when she asked you? Gooot it. Lol.
And hmmm 😮 So what're you planning to do?
Marisa (Mawisa): you don't know them? :0
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Maybe Blake*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Blake Belladonna?! 👀 ~~
Marisa (Mawisa): maybe it's blake

ZombieHunter: She was debating a name change
ZombieHunter: And@Blake was the potential name lmfao
ZombieHunter: She’s been my friend for two years almost
ZombieHunter: I helped her through a bad break up and now she’s been talkin to me
ZombieHunter: So it’s nice. I’m just awful at flirting.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): A big as mood. Flirting is hard XD
Jess (whoozica): awww! yay! it might be easier now that you know the feelings mutual? best of luck!
ZombieHunter: Thanks guys
Rebecca (madameterralupus): When you've been so stressed and tired from school that you just want to relax in between finals this week so you cancel all your doctor appts... WOOPS xD
Georgia (Something Sensible): Send eggplant emojis, nothing else
Georgia (Something Sensible): Trust me, I’m an expert
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol ah yes the only way to flirt is eggplant emojis
Georgia (Something Sensible): We need Leanna up in here, Ethan describes us both as “chronically not single”
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’d be sold 😏
Rebecca (madameterralupus): *Chronically not single* 😂
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Wowowo
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Eggplants arent the way to go
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Peaches and cakes
Jess (whoozica): dog emojis
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Make sure to use *Hawt tit :\* too. That's really a winner
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Real talk flirting is pretty straight forward 
Being aware that you are flirting is harder
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ^ <:valid:420824413592748032>
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hawt tit is the finisher
Georgia (Something Sensible): You gotta reel them in with the eggplant
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LmMAO okay but like why did when I type that I questioned hmm do you use that for men too or would you use *Hawt dick :\* instead?? XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): make sure you **wiggle**
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): chronically not single and can verify, wiggles work
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): specifically, doing the worm
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://giphy.com/gifs/weird-wiggle-love-c1ORoB1FORyqk
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): See exactly Leanna and I are the experts
Georgia (Something Sensible): We know the WORM
Georgia (Something Sensible): that’s like alpha knowledge here
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Worm? Like, *worm disco*?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh, worm

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe):

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I think we sell those worm things at my work xD
Marisa (Mawisa): oh, worm?
Jess (whoozica): oh? worm!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~why cant there be a worm emoji lol~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): SqUiRmLeS
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol we can't get something to work in the class room for us to do presentations... Let's just go home and email our presentations to him instead XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): .~. We moved to a different classroom. Dammit
Marisa (Mawisa): say you got lost in the move
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao I wish
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~it was so confusing. I got so lost on my way across the hallway lol~~
Marisa (Mawisa): oh no how tragic. sit out today’s presentation and recover.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao oh how I wish. Thankfully I made 90% of my slides music links so I don't have to talk 😝 (perks of getting the artist and genres section lol)
Marisa (Mawisa): I decided to finally go to bed and now we’re getting lots of tiny earthquakes owo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes 😱
Marisa (Mawisa): party
Jess (whoozica): the earth doesnt wanna sleep either
ZombieHunter: You’re all gonna be the reason I stay single
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): lol
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): ok so hunter in all seriousness
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😤 I just want to present already and go home already. I just want to get this over with. Everyone in this class intimidates me. I don't want to present but I have to... I fear imma get ridiculed. I just want to get it over wiiittthh 😫
ZombieHunter: I used to flirt with this girl. She had a gf next. They broke up. I was her friend and have been supportive for the year or so.
ZombieHunter: Aaaaand now she wants to go on a date
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): you really are kinda past "flirting" right now 
like the person your talking to has straight up told you they like you and wants a date
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): plus if they already know you well
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): and made that decision you don't need to flirt
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👆
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): its cliche but just be yourself 
Trying to employ 'flirting' at this point is just gonna make you nervous and make you act different
ZombieHunter: I know this but like
ZombieHunter: I’ve been single for two years
ZombieHunter: Like
ZombieHunter: 🥔
ZombieHunter: Help
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I overheard someone say we are here listening to presentations until 3:30?! Uhhh... I work at 4 .~. I hope that ain't true
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao we ran out of time (went to 2:30) so now we in a random classroom recording ourselves presenting it 😂 this is a shit show
Georgia (Something Sensible): I h8 these stupid physics boys and their mansplaining
Georgia (Something Sensible): We had to explain the probability of finding a bead on a hoop when it’s spun
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I was like “intuitively you would know [insert physics here]”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And they’re like uhh no you have to do the math and I’m like “yeah you do the math, but here’s how you look at the problem first to see if the math even makes sense”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And they’re like “UhH bUt ThE mAtH”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I’m like _yes we still do math but how about you look at the problem first_
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oof it grinds my gears
Jess (whoozica): THE MATH GEORGIA THE MATH
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Got my Echo Dot, set it up, and my mom's first reaction "Ah shit, get that thing out of the house!"
Jess (whoozica): Lmao
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So like, she's making me unplug it when I'm not at home because they don't want Amazon spying on our house?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's really dumb and she put me in a pissy mood so now I can't even enjoy it
Jess (whoozica): Yea some people don't like them cuz of that 😔 sorry she bum you out!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): More incentive to move out... 😒
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Although I don't get what having it off when no one's home is going to do?
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I have a 10 minute speech to do tomorrow and I procrastinated a lot cause of the weekend and before that I had a big research paper that was filling up my down time 😣 and now the only time I have to work on it is after 10:30 tonight and like two hours before I have to present cause work 😧
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Current stress level is so bad I almost broke down crying in front of framer Eric at work tonight 😫😭
Matt (mattmyers25): (Hugs)
