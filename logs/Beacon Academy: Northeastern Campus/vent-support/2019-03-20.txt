Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~but im an idiotttttt and gotta study~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): Iâ€™m printing that out and putting it in my GRE book
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i wish i could agree with that but when I was in school one of our professors made fun of us for not being prepared a week in advance for our test... and in the same breath assigned us a ridiculous lab/homework that would be due before the exam
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~nothing beats the satisfaction you get from passing out after you stayed up for 2 days to study for your exam~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): lol wut.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ðŸŽµ  my professors were crazy
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Oh I meant satisfaction from studying.

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee I bitched to my department head about the professor who didnt take my docs note too. I was like I am sorry I have a major health issue I need fixed but like...?? I also told him ahead of time too but he kinda blew it off. Literally any other professor would accept it. I didnt want to go to the docs then but it was the only time we could get in and kidna need to...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Only professor I actually fully hate and gave lip to. Ever. He was quite the jackass to a LOT of students~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh nah like i wouldve thrown hands at ur prof

Anna (loud and likely blonde): good
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~o man i just rememberd i almost threw hands at my surveying prof cause he was like. giving us entirely different instructions than we had been given at the start of class~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was warned before not to take him as a professor but I needed the class and he was the only one avail T_T ... I learned my lesson. I avoid him at all costs now
Anna (loud and likely blonde): that stem life
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~we were surveying in basically the dark in the cold for 3 hours and i was mad he gave us such poor instructions we couldn't finish and like my friends sarah and tanya were like. we thought you were gonna actually fight him~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): The amount of training academics get in teaching and classroom management is zero. That's not hyperbole. It's just assumed they will pick it up, no matter what their skills and experience is
Mark (Mad Doctor): We got no training when I was teaching as a grad student, either
Anna (loud and likely blonde): F
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Rebecca i feel u cause my friend. Someone literally broke into his door room, started beating the shit out of him, his roommate had to beat the guy off with a stapler, the cops were called cause the guy ran.... friend had to get surgery and had a broken nose and wrist and missed a BME orgo exam because of it..... and the prof wouldnt let him retake the test
Rebecca (madameterralupus): O_o That story was a fucking trip. WHat the hellll
Georgia (Something Sensible): The grad student life is more wild than I thought
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Bruh some people have no care in the world when it comes to health related stuff. Like damn. Have a heart and some care. Shit happens and we cant control it... holy fuccckkk~~

Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~more reasons for me to hate humanity.. wow~~
