Anna (loud and likely blonde): Tonight has been. A SHITSHOW

Anna (loud and likely blonde): Greg didn't tell us his gf was 20 and we all picked a bar that ended up snapping her fake in half so we spent an hour tryna cool him down even tho he's an idiot. We waited 40 minutes for them all to show up cause we couldn't sit till we had half the party so instead we had to leave and went to. Three places before we could find damn place that can fit ten people

Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Yeah he would, for free
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XD
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Like I feel like I don't hate my ex as much as I should. In retrospect he did a lot of shitty things to me that I really shouldn't have allowed, but I was too spineless at the time to protest
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm I feel that
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I feel like leaving him on read is an appropriate way to say "I don't like you please don't talk to me." Without outright saying it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee
Georgia (Something Sensible): you gotta mari kondo exes
Georgia (Something Sensible): she says you gotta thank an item for the time it sparked joy, but now it no longer sparks joy, so YEET BEGONE
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmaoo
Anna (loud and likely blonde): <@229713389511901185> WHOMST IS THIS GUY
Georgia (Something Sensible): LOL WUT
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *sir you are being that guy*
Marisa (Mawisa): why is he so wrong
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Evie and I were having a NICE WHOLESOME TWITTER CONVO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): WHY
Marisa (Mawisa): Marriage is ok at 16 with both parents permission under certain circumstances but that‚Äôs an old law. Age of consent is otherwise 20 because literally anything under 20 is a minor. If age of consent is 13 then why are so many female teachers getting arrested for sleeping with students
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Marisa can I use your response
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Pls
Marisa (Mawisa): N O
Lolita is so big in anime because it‚Äôs taboo irl and anime lets people live out their sick fantasies
Anna (loud and likely blonde): PLS CAN I REPLY WITH UR RESPONSW
Marisa (Mawisa): Ye pls
Marisa (Mawisa): Educate
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ye
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Sent both. I'm just not replying after that
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I have shit to hem and crime shows to watch
Marisa (Mawisa): Dang I was gonna settle down and watch the drama unfold but yeah he isn‚Äôt worth your time
Anna (loud and likely blonde): This is as bad as the time on FB I had to explain why my now only acquaintance Scott why ppl were calling him an insensitive and wrong idiot for saying the singer from blink was weak for committing suicide (the tldr)
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I love me some drama but like
Anna (loud and likely blonde): IDGAF dude
Anna (loud and likely blonde): He was. An insensitive and wrong idiot. But that's obvious
Anna (loud and likely blonde): MARISA HES REPLYING WITH DUMB SHIT
Marisa (Mawisa): ‚ÄúObviously lol‚Äù
And then he asks if you‚Äôre talking about YAH
Marisa (Mawisa): IM@DYING
Marisa (Mawisa): oh he said unfortunately EW THATS EORSE
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 
Marisa (Mawisa): wow a single google search. So academic.
Marisa (Mawisa): Same exact site
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *sigh* this is a lot to unpack on the twitter . Com
Marisa (Mawisa): Just because the country has a law doesn‚Äôt mean each prefecture doesn‚Äôt have stricter laws
Anna (loud and likely blonde): One more response
I give up
Marisa (Mawisa): It‚Äôs illegal to shower naked in some states in the US and in Arizona you can‚Äôt have a missing tooth visible when you smile
Marisa (Mawisa): Or at least in one city for the shower thing
Anna (loud and likely blonde): which one can't u throw pickles at cabooses in
Marisa (Mawisa): A very sad state
Anna (loud and likely blonde): It's fine we can throw corn dogs instead
Mark (Mad Doctor): Better not be PA.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): They have a more satisfying crack noise anyways
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Did we summon mark via mention of pickles
Marisa (Mawisa): I liked your post but unliked it because most of my followers are Japanese natives
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I assume they know their laws then 
Dw I am not offended
Marisa (Mawisa): Don‚Äôt want them thinking I‚Äôm a perv if all they can read is ‚Äúage of consent‚Äù in that image
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I treat Twitter like yikyak
Marisa (Mawisa): Like a lot of grade schoolers (middle/high) would go to cosplay events but if the event was after 6pm they weren‚Äôt allowed, you had to be 20 or older even though the evening cosplay events were **exactly** the same as the daytime ones
Marisa (Mawisa): Most lolicon is banned now but there‚Äôs a big black market for it
Marisa (Mawisa): That‚Äôs how you know this guy sucks, he‚Äôs calling lolicon Lolita which are totally different in japan and weeb spaces
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Yeah i saw that but was like that's an entirely different argument
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Someone comments on penny photo " oh my God shes so old for that üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ " 

Fam. I cant change my age xD 
Also are only 16 year olds supposed to cosplay? Lmaoooooo you're in the wrong hobby then

Mark (Mad Doctor): Less than a week to go, and the Marvel shoot still hasn't announced a time. I'm at the point where I'm going to set my rotation, and if I miss the shoot, so be it
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The marvel shoot is a complete mess
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): The girl who runs it is.... not a good leader
Mark (Mad Doctor): She wants to please everyone.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'd say just go if its convenient
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Make your line up and then if it happens to line up then yay
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But if not, not a big deal
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yeah. My goal for Zenkai is to chill, get silly, and keep Audrey and her friends from getting arrested. The RWBY shoot is my only fixed point
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Is.... Is potential arrest really that prominent bc I am now afraid for your weekend
Mark (Mad Doctor): One of Audrey's friends just told me that I should have more realistic goals...
Mark (Mad Doctor): They're plotting in the fort as we speak
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh my god
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Goals
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Tell them I'm so proud
