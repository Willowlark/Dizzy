Erik (Red Riot Thot): > Customer: These assemblies were made incorrectly. You used a ring terminal for M3 screws instead of M4 *as specified in the drawing*
> Me: I'm so sorry, I'm not sure how this happened! 
> Me: *~investigates~*
> Me: Hey, turns out we did use the correct part *as specified in the drawing* but these rings are meant for #4 screws which are a different size than M4.
