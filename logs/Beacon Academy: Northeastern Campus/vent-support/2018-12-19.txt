Georgia (Something Sensible): People have been dropping reminders in the physics chats with finals season about, and I don’t think many of us took/are taking finals, but here’s the generic reminder: you are worth more than the grades you get or the work you do. You are all loved, passionate individuals that have potential to do so much good in the world, and success will most definitely find you  ❤
Georgia (Something Sensible): As someone in a difficult, competitive field, i sometimes need to remind myself of these facts, so in case anyone else needed to hear this, here you go 💕
Erik (Red Riot Thot): As someone who also went into a difficult field, I wholeheartedly agree. Everything will be ok in the end! You'll do the thing! You'll make it through!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Please tell my students this
Matt (mattmyers25): In today's world, we rely on tests too much. Tests do not define a person and do not give someone to show off their true potential
Georgia (Something Sensible): grades have to be put into perspective too, a lot of kids excel in one field but... thats all they do
Georgia (Something Sensible): theres some really genius physics kids in my college, who consistently get 4.0s across the board, but could they sew their own CORSET? hell no
Mark (Mad Doctor): I have so many students who are good, caring people yet they are under so much pressure to excel academically that they are heading for breakdowns. I had a parent tell me last week "average isn't good enough for my daughter". Lady, your kid is going to be fine. Chill.
Matt (mattmyers25): Parents put so much pressure on their kids these days. I feel like parents can ruin a kids life more so than the kid
Mark (Mad Doctor): A lot of it is kids internalizing what they think their parents expect of them.  I wish we could stop classes for a day or even a week to help kids come to an understanding of what "happy" and "successful" mean
Jess (whoozica): Big mood Mark
Marisa (Mawisa): My friend said “I’m homesick” and I said “do you want to talk about it” because I accidentally misread her message as “I’m homestuck” and everything got really deep really fast when I was just expecting troll memes.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): HA
Tom (tomukuncosplay): OOF
Jess (whoozica): Not so much a vent but more of an observation. Last week I spent like 2 full days working on a presentation for an older (65+) co-worker. He said "Thank you" and I said "No problem!" which is my usual response for something, especially when I consider it "my job. He thanked me a few times over the course of the few days because he kept needing support from me. Again - not a problem. but each time he kept correcting me bay saying "Well, it could have been a problem" or "Say 'your welcome' " Which reminded me about this article, or one similar, I hadn't really thought much about it when I read it but I definitely saw it in practice with him last week:

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I know I've seen those articles, but never seen it in practice either.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Damn.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah me neither
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think I use a mix of both "You're welcome" and "No problem"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't usually think about it to notice which I use more
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But having someone "correct" you would get annoying really fast
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No problem, my pleasure, the rare your welcome (usually when I feel awkward about being thanked for whatever)...
Jess (whoozica): yea I didnt notice it either but when he corrected me I was like "bro, really?" I say "no problem" because I literally see it as not a problem, caused me no trouble, or i consider part of "my job" the only time I say "you're welcome" is when someone asks me like for a big favor, or thanks me for a gift or something"
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I code switch depending on the person I'm speaking to, with the regulars at work I have a less formal attitude lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): Correcting grammar or usage when an idea or feeling is otherwise clearly communicated is an act of aggression.  One person is trying to establish ownership of a language over another. When an older person insists on an older usage (and in this case, "You're welcome" makes no literal sense. Welcome to what?), it usually masks a fear of change. And languages change.

Jess (whoozica): 👏
Marisa (Mawisa): Jess I was thinking a lot about that yesterday how spooky. It’s definitely a generational thing. People get angry about not saying “you’re welcome” because on the other hand “no problem” implies that it could have been an issue and caused a problem like your coworker said. It’s also what they were raised to hear and expect that in return, like how we expect people to say “good, you?” when someone asks “how are you?”
But newer generations talk completely differently prior ones (it’s always been that way but perhaps it’s more prominent now because internet?) and there’s been a big shift in the way younger generations talk that reflects societal morals. 

In other news I got an A yesterday on my 30 page formulaic language assignment yehaw
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WAFUU
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *who says wafuu*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Kud!
Marisa (Mawisa): え？
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5W4eBx3kW4
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wow.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Little busters is the thing that stumps you?
Mark (Mad Doctor): I remember teachers getting upset when we used the word "cool"
Marisa (Mawisa): No I knew it was a little busters thing (you said Kud also) but her wafu means Japanese style 和風
Marisa (Mawisa): I was trying to figure out yesterday if Japanese had the same pragmatics as English when it came to saying you’re welcome

Cool................... such an outlaw thing to say
Jess (whoozica): Whoa! That's crazy we we're both in thinking g about, congrats on your test!
Marisa (Mawisa): Thx I may have horribly failed the others and they’re mailing one paper back to me because we turned in physical copies only and the professor lives on the other side of the country 
(Actually I’m going there this week omg I wonder if I can pick the test up)
