Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Wiggle in their general direction
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh mood hunter

Rebecca (madameterralupus): *worm*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Worn at them
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Finger guns work too
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Can confirm ☝🏻
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So does nervous dabbing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): In all honesty though Hunter... I've noticed just being yourself, being nice, funny and talking a lot is good. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Crack some jokes, let them know you're thinking of them by sharing things, talk to them often, hang often.. etc. but most importantly be yourself 🤗💕
Anna [Cyborg]: Apparently it's impossible to tell flirting from being nice and friendly so just do that but throw in some hitting on them lines
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👆🏻👆🏻👆🏻
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed
ZombieHunter: <@!169297844874903552>
ZombieHunter: She said we have to go to@kbbq together and now I have to marry her
ZombieHunter: 😃
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's not flirting, but the best advice I can give you is don't hesitate. If you like/are interested in her, show it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes hunter 👏🏻 the fact she was thinking of messaging you earlier and wants to grab food is good signs! Also you saying to her hope you had a good weekend and that you are wishing her the best/thinking of her is good too 😃
