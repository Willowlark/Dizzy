Rebecca (madameterralupus): So my new phone came and i havent backed it up since Jan/Feb apparently. All the texts on it are from the beginning of the year...Looking at all the texts I sent to Matt during my struggles of heart surgery is interesting. And it's neat to see how I was out of commission for 2 months at the beginning and seeing how far I came and recovered since then. 😮
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): There are at least half a dozen chat logs from the beginning of the year that I'd rather die than reread...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol most of mine are the same. But this was neat to see how bad I was struggling just a few months ago and see how much I progressed since then. I also the scar progress pics I was planning to look for XD
Jess (whoozica): Me: " I wish I had a tablet here" (meaning a drawing tablet)
