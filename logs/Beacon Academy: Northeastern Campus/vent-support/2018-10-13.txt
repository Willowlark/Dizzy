Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Hi my name is Halim and my computer cant find any audio playing devices
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Not the headphones i plugged in
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Not the bang and olufsen speakers it comes with
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Not anything
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): fml
Erik (slendergiant): Did you try restarting your computer?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): multiple times
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): it seems if I plug in a fancy set of headphones they will work
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): like how if you use a usb mouse it can work even if your mousepad doesn't
Erik (slendergiant): So apparently we were *barely* out of the affected area for the boil water advisory... so we could have been using our water this whole time 😑
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Can you look at your available devices and make sure your speakers are set to default device? Otherwise the sound will be output in the wrong spot and nothing happens <@288513265661902858>
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): thats the thing
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): there aren't any other available devices
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Shiit
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Like it shows nothing in the audio devices?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Let me open the menu on mine
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): yeah except for my headset I plugged in
Tom (tomukuncosplay): this menu only shows the headset?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): yep
Tom (tomukuncosplay): shiiiit
Tom (tomukuncosplay): is this a laptop?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ye
Tom (tomukuncosplay): if you right click on whatever it shows there are both of these checked?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): yep
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): its like somehow the speakers and everything are just gone?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Damn.. Thats all I got TwT, Its gotta be hardware of some sort, but since its a lap top that makes that more complicated..
Tom (tomukuncosplay): te only other thing that it *could* be is maybe a conflicting driver
Tom (tomukuncosplay): but its not showing up at all so thats the most concerning thing
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): yeah
Marisa (Weeb): I very rarely get headaches. Very rare. 
And I have a really bad one for some reason.  
So I returned to my hotel to rest. 
There’s one pillow and *its so hard it’s like a rock*
It’s the kind that’s filled with buckwheat husks and not like. Cotton or polyester or foam or anything. Of course. <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Marisa (Weeb): I also want a shower but I am Socially Anxious so I’m waiting until hopefully no one else is in there. :3
ZombieHunter: I woke up at 4 and now I can’t Sleep
Marisa (Weeb): Make pancakes
Marisa (Weeb): 
ZombieHunter: 
Marisa (Weeb): YEAH NOW WE’RE TALKIN
ZombieHunter: That’s my boy max
Marisa (Weeb): That’s you right now makin pancakes
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wait, what Hotel Marisa?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Are you traveling?
Marisa (Weeb): Hewwo
Ya
外川そ (idk the last kanji but it’s something. The stylized text doesn’t help.)
Marisa (Weeb): It’s expensive because of a bunch of random fees. They really don’t like solo travelers here outside of business. Also because it was so expensive I walked 8 miles to save like $5 lol
Marisa (Weeb): And everything closes early because it gets pitch black at 6pm. Spooky.
Marisa (Weeb): I finally get TV and it’s all about Trump. Where’s the anime
ZombieHunter: Buying my car today!!!
Casey (Raining_Jellyfish): woo! 🙌🏻
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Be me, actually doing code work on my windows desktop
> use macbook for work
> try keyboard shortcut
> doesn't work
> blame editor
> blame windows
> realize it's a different shortcut on windows
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'm so used to working on my laptop (on one side of my desk) I keep rotating to type in discord on my laptop; rather than the desktop I'm sitting in front of.
ZombieHunter: Or not
ZombieHunter: >.<
ZombieHunter: My mom is mad at the dealership so we might go elsewhere today
ZombieHunter: I hope today. I really need a car....
ZombieHunter: >.<
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good luck. Though if they were putting too much pressure on you it's not a bad idea to walk away
ZombieHunter: My mom says why are they charging us for a mandatory inspection when we plan on buying the car
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): True, they should have inspected it.
ZombieHunter: And the guy tried to hide it from us
ZombieHunter: Told mom she had to get it done. Got here. And then they told me at the desk it’s 500 dollars
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You gotta be willing to walk about when buying cars, it’s how you get the best deals.
ZombieHunter: So my mom. Fierce little woman. Is picking a fight with the sales manager
ZombieHunter: It’s not even a walk around. We leased a car and they’re giving us a run around on it
Georgia (Something Sensible): [kicks open the door as I currently am at work, in a car dealership] the inspection should be included, it’s like asking someone to pay to have their pizza inspected before delivery
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestlyyyy I hate to say it but you can bully salespeople a little bit
Georgia (Something Sensible): Never attack them PERSONALLY but there’s nothing wrong with playing hard ball with the money
ZombieHunter: My mom is good at it
ZombieHunter: Lmfao thanks Georgia
Georgia (Something Sensible): No problem
Georgia (Something Sensible): The money comes out of the dealership, not the salesperson, so idk why he would be tryna scam you
ZombieHunter: But I get it. Inspection should be included because they’re making sure the car is still safe to sell. But now my mom is like. Alright. Fine. We won’t buy it.
ZombieHunter: Mind you we bought two other cars from the same dealer. Now my mom will probably never go back.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Until the sales guy calls her back and says “I talked to my boss, we can wave that fee”.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They want the sale too, but they’re trying to see what shit you’ll put up with to make more money.
ZombieHunter: Basically.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Walking away is a part of the process.
ZombieHunter: My mom doesn’t play those games
ZombieHunter: Bless her.
Erik (slendergiant): I should have bugged the salesperson to have my car's gas tank filled before I bought it... But they had already taken $200 off to put towards new tires...
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~my dealership sells with gas filled, I thought that was the courtesy~~
Erik (slendergiant): I also had to ask them to inflate the tires because they were low
Erik (slendergiant): And I had to get new wipers the next day because they were *awful*
Erik (slendergiant): But yeah I had to stop for gas after driving it off the lot
ZombieHunter: Update: we found an online pamphlet on how to buy the car without the dealer. 

~~fuck that guy~~
you want fucking rwby chibi?: wish me luck i had a job interview today 🤞
Mak (hollyjollymak): You got this!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Good luck!
ZombieHunter: Good luckkkkk
ZombieHunter: So my dad low key adores this one friend of mine. So he encouraged me to share my photography equipment with them.  So they have two lenses I wasn’t particularly using often when I started out at the beginning of the year. 

It has been somewhere around 7-10 months now and she hasn’t returned the lenses. And I’m talking big lenses. Ones a wide angle something and the other is a big zoom lens I think. And every time I ask, she beats around the bush about it.
ZombieHunter: I’m just high key angry right now.
