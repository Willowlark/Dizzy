Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao. Your phone is listening to ye olde tales everytime we're at Georgia's XD
Marisa (Weeb): Good targeted ads. Good.
Marisa (Weeb): You should impulse buy it
Mark (Mad Doctor): Hey, you little cretin. Did you not hear me say "Feel free to take a handful of candy?" Did I say "two handfils"? I sure as hell didn't say three, so when I smacked your hand away after telling you to leave some for your sister, why did you look surprised? Ungrateful turd.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Damn
Mark (Mad Doctor): 99% of kids on Halloween are wonderful. Sadly, it's the 1% I remember
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oof yeah
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Picking classes is always so hard >.< I have everything set but one final class cause everything I pick keeps overlapping with others
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof I just had a cringe-worthy phone screening from a recruiter ðŸ˜‘
Jess (whoozica): oh no
Erik (Red Riot Thot): just a lot of blanking and then I had that issue where I was getting feedback from her end so I was hearing myself talk at a delay which was really distracting and there was background noise on her end and she was asking me about the job an I forgot what all the job entailed
Erik (Red Riot Thot): she also asked what I liked about my current job and I had to bullshit my way through that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): BUT
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Damn oof
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I feel like background noise one in my bones
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If for whatever reason they decide to bring me in for an interview and then actually hire me, the job would involve about 50% travelling both in and out of the country which would be pretty neat
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oof.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Be careful with that, it can get exhausting. 

source: dumbass with 2 1/2 one way commute.
