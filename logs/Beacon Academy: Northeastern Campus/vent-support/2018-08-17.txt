Rebecca (madameterralupus): >___< I am going to scream. Kalahari charged me like $30 more for the deposit of my second room. And trying to get an answer is V confusing... ugh
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I think they had upped the price of something recently... 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And they couldn't have said anything? 🤔  hoping i get it fixed cause both my rooms are the same with same amount of people >.<
Jess (whoozica): charge for extra people in the room?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He said it was something with that? And that he fixed it but I'm still confused as to what his reasoning of why was cause he was hard to understand >.< 
But like if it had something to do with extra people they should still be the same amount deposit cause both rooms have 6 people in them 🤷🏻‍♀️
 Either way he said my totals for the weekend are exactly the same. So at least I know I'm not getting charged extra for one over the other. Just one must have been processed differently.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sounds like, because you told them you'd be doing 6 people from the start, they included the 35 extra person fee in the deposit for the room.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Kalahari charges 35 for the 5th and 6th person in the reservation.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Must have been. But I swear he did also say I was getting charged $50 per extra person?? I may call back another day and double check. And get a better explanation lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I just spoke to them. Kalahari has changed the 5th and 6th person policy to 50 dollars going forward, however rooms in the Kalahari room block are locked into the 35 dollar price.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Are you in the room block?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): For CCE?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): yeah.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Then you should only have 35*2, 70 dollars additional a night.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I may have my dad look at my bills tonight and check stuff. If I worry something is wrong I'll call back this week. But like I said he said my final totals for the weekend are the same so I'm not too worried??
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and for those with me, note is in for "water park view" and for connecting.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😮 damn that's another thing I should have asked for is a balcony and making sure my two rooms are next to one another loo
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You can have it put in the notes, but it's not a guarantee... There's some luck to it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👌🏻 gonna try and see what I can do lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Now, if you tell them you have a medical reason or something they can probably get you a guarantee, but you have to have a reason that'd make sense.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I meaaannn I do have Snow in my room who may be bringing her wheelchair just in case xD
