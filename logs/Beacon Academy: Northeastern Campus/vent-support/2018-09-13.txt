Marisa (Weeb): ghgggg i can't get tickets to the yona stage play because the ticket booking website requires registration, and you have to authenticate your phone number by calling an automated system, and i keep getting errors or "phone number unavailable" no matter how i call so I can't register to buy the ticket <:imdyingsquirtle:378261448838610944> 
maybe this is a sign to save money
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof that sucks ☹️ hopefully something works out that you end up being able to go
Marisa (Weeb): I sit outside the theater for every show, viciously sobbing.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey my dudes I usually don’t post something like this, but I want you all to be aware.
If you’re friends with a guy named Kyle Joseph E on Facebook, I highly recommend cutting him out of your life. He’s highly toxic, manipulative, and all around not a great person.
I say this as someone who was friends with him for 4 years. Who thought he could change. He can’t, he won’t, and he is dangerous. 
Just getting the word out there since one of my friends came out about his abuse and many others are coming forward with their stories.
Marisa (Weeb): Thank you for the warning oh no
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You’re welcome 💖
I’ve known him for a while so that’s why I’m warning everyone. He’s shown he can’t change his ways and his toxicity got worse. 
I want my friends to be safe. Especially the ladies.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Highkey don't wanna go into work tonight cause the manager closing with me is our new one and I'm not too fond of her. She seems very strict, know it all, and like she doesn't tolerate fun/jokes (which we all do) 😫 I constantly fear she's gonna find some reason to get me in trouble even though I never do anything wrong...
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I had a couple managers like that a while ago 😕😕 they left though
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Don't worry, I believe in you!
Jess (whoozica): its hard for me to imagine you ever getting in trouble XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Imma do my best to avoid her but make it seem like im not intentionally doing so 🙃
And lol ohhhh trust me I have Jess 😂 but mostly for stupid shit that makes no sense
Jess (whoozica): yea like i couldn't see you ever deliberately making trouble
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂 i try to be an angel 😇
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): You are an angel
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~cough sure I am~~
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): I love you !
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): Its gonna be okay
Evie (Katheryne Knight): You got this girl!
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): So I got blood work done and my arm hurts so much
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh no 😦
Mak (hollyjollymak): HOUR AND A HALF TILL FLOOR EVENT AND I HAVE NO SUPPLIES
AAAAAAAAAAAAH
