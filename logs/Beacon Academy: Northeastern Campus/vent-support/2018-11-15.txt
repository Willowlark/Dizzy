Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed
Georgia (Something Sensible): My heater just broke in my dorm.... it’s gonna snow tomorrow.......
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh damn! 😱 grab lots of blankets and curl up. I guess no one is able to fix it tonight? :/
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nope :/ that explains why I woke up freezing though 😂
Jess (whoozica): Oooo nooo 😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof... that really sucks.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hopefully you dont freeze too much tonight. Hoard all the blankets!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Set fires!
Georgia (Something Sensible): BURN RUTGERS WOO
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I’ll put like 10 layers on lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Go hang out at a friends.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I’m sure you won’t have trouble finding someone to shelter you for a snow day.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 👆 he right. ~~eyebrow wiggles~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Wiggles implied.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Noah has a midterm so I cannot bother him 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof that sucks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Take over his room, lock him out. He can have the living room xD
Georgia (Something Sensible): LMAO U RIGHT he doesn’t need sleep, it’s just a Calc 5 exam lmao
Jess (whoozica): Does your living room still have heat?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nopeeee
Georgia (Something Sensible): No part of my suite has heat
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is yours the only suite to have lost heat??
Georgia (Something Sensible): So far yeah! How weird is that?
Georgia (Something Sensible): They had to fix our air conditioning in September
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wonder if they fixed it too well
Georgia (Something Sensible): Okay so I figured it out
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sarah only sleeps here on Wednesday’s
Georgia (Something Sensible): She just came back and I’m in the middle of a league match so OOPS my clicking is gonna keep her up
Georgia (Something Sensible): Her just getting back at almost midnight is weird tho
Marisa (Weeb): how tragic
Georgia (Something Sensible): She just turned the lights out
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m still playing
Georgia (Something Sensible): We see how this goes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Does she have the balls to tell me to stop
Georgia (Something Sensible): Stay tuned
Jess (whoozica): Did she have the balls? 
No sympathy for her I've had to sleep through hundreds of league matches being played next to my head
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sleet has offficialy hit my area. Like it just started 5 mins again and is coming down super hard... I'm probs going home after this first class cause if not I'll be stuck in Millersville ~~since they never salt or plow the roads well >.>~~
Jess (whoozica): 😭  im not ready im not ready
Mark (Mad Doctor): Surrounding school districts are sending their busses to take kids home early. All hell is about to break loose
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've been waiting for my school to say classes are ending early or whatever. So far nothing .-.
I might try to fight it out for my next class if it looks okay but I don't think I'll be staying for the afternoon class cause I won't get home in time for work if I do
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Remember the days when schools would wait until it was actually snowing to close?
Jess (whoozica): ~~remember the days when i was in school~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): Even my students who slept with their pajamas inside out last night think that this early dismissal is weak sauce
Jess (whoozica): lmao
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I will never be over the one time in high school when they closed school the night before "the storm of the year" and I woke up to flurries that stopped within an hour... Snow day wasted. And that was back when we used to use our unused snow days for Fridays in May.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> My college is closing at noon! YEET
Georgia (Something Sensible): No snow reported in New Brunswick yet!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): we'd get it before you.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My teacher walked into class close to time it starts and the one kid goes "Mr.Elliot welcome to Theatre Appreciation! Please sign in!" 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's precipitating here but like, a very light sleet
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, I could barely see it
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): so you could say your area is barely *participating* in the *precipitation*.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's starting to lay here. Coming down pretty well.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Not a flake in the Philadelphia burbs
Mark (Mad Doctor): Saw the first one as I was typing that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's partially participating in the precipitation
Erik (Red Riot Thot): uhp and now we have full on snow 😒
Jess (whoozica): its pretty sad that im hoping we close early so i can go home and do laundry 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO JESS SAME

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): this is honestly my favorite video that ever existed
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it brought me many tears of joy and a hell of an ab workout
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Why does Millersville suck when it comes to snow... at this rate I'm beer getting home 😅
Mark (Mad Doctor): Our school is a wasteland now. I might have 2/17 students in my last class, but I have to wait until 3:00 to go
Georgia (Something Sensible): SNOW ACQUIRED
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I left school an hour and a half ago... still not home .-.
Jess (whoozica): no now, but we got sleet wheee

Halim (Greg): guys don't go out in the snow without gloves or a jacket or a hat

Matt (mattmyers25): Dont forget to yeet
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): unrelated to snow, my car, which i just had to buy a couple months ago is apparently shitting out on me already <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>

Halim (Greg): Just got a text from UD
"Classes scheduled to begin at 2 p.m., today, are canceled."

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Why 👏  is 👏 my 👏 job 👏 staying 👏 open.... Literally no one is going to come in to shop
Jess (whoozica): Why 👏 does 👏 my 👏 work 👏 not 👏 close. We dont even have a physical store or see customers.
Jess (whoozica): Our managers are doing the pro strat where they all go into a meeting as soon as the snow start accumulating so no one can ask if we can go home <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Dumbass me did not prepare for this weather. Did not bring gloves. Only wore my dual-jacket combo. And wore ankle socks and canvas shoes... 😑
Georgia (Something Sensible): Class still on for rutgersss
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, heading home. We'll see how long my usual 10 minute drive takes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My normal 20 min drive took me 2 hours... cause I was dumb and went through the city
Mark (Mad Doctor): 30 minutes since I left and I'm still in the parking lot. Accidents on every road around school
Jess (whoozica): opp we getting out at 4 i hope the plows come by then
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Took me 35 minutes to get home
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Saw a poor minivan stuck on a hill, front tires spinning
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Saw another van driving backwards (in the correct direction of traffic, just facing the wrong way) to pull into a parking lot and cut around the other way
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Just got home.
Got off at 1
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s horrid out there be safe guys
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yikes. Took me an hour, 4x slower than usual
