Mark (Mad Doctor): My wife is in Canada on a business trip. She was supposed to return tonight, but her flight got cancelled and she won't be home until tomorrow. We are supposed to leave for our vacation to England tomorrow afternoon and now she might not be able to go ðŸ˜ž
Matt (mattmyers25): Are you two flying from the same airport?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Well duh. I get what you mean from that cause you explained next to me lol. But uhh... could she not grab another flight to England later/after you guys? Know it sucks kinda still but she'd at least still be able to join ya
Mark (Mad Doctor): Because it's weather, they will give her a voucher for the price of the flight. We'd have to book a last minute flight and that would run $3000.  We're all supposed to leave from Philadelphia
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn... that really sucks :/
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I hope everything works out for all you guys to go together
Mark (Mad Doctor): At 3:00 am, my wife was able to book a series of flights that will get her to Philadelphia at noon. We're going to England, yo!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Thanks for the positive vibes
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That's good to hear!!!
Matt (mattmyers25): That is good to hear. Have fun in England
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yaaayy!!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Awesome, hope you guys have lots of fun!
Anna [Cyborg]: The sporadic storm we got knocked out the train service right before the station I need to get to ðŸ™ƒ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof ðŸ˜¦
Anna [Cyborg]: I lied knocked out the ENTIRE EASTERN HALF of the LIRR
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Daaaamnnn
Anna [Cyborg]: It was like a freak storm
