Georgia (Something Sensible): So my dorm hall had a decorating contest
Georgia (Something Sensible): And so we went around as a group to judge everyone’s doors and vote together
Georgia (Something Sensible): And we got to my door (and of course you can’t say which is your door or else people will be biased)
Georgia (Something Sensible): And this group of like 6 girls starts making fun of it and leaving mean comments on the dry erase board?
Georgia (Something Sensible): And they’re like “I bet a bunch of weirdos live here”
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I’m just standing there like “...” but in reality I’m so mad cause I worked really hard to decorate the door??
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): And these JERK girls completely bashed the door decorations for no reason
Mark (Mad Doctor): A) your door looks great
B) How exactly does that mean girls shit reflect the holiday spirit?
C) Why does a space-themed door signify wierdo?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Man idk but they were just a bunch of bitchy girls
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean a lot of guys were like “YO I LIKE THE LIGHTS AND STAR CHART”
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I almost wish I had been like “aha yes excuse me that’s my door you jerks” but I’m not confrontational 😅
Jess (whoozica): What the fuck?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Da fuq. They're obvs just jealous of how dope your door is. Don't let them get to you. But that is really mean. Like grow up and stop the bullying, your adults now -.-
I think your door is fantastic!!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): You **should** be proud of it, it's awesome, don't let them get ya down 👌
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah like some people were just raised with no manners i guess?
ZombieHunter: My throat hurts so bad I can’t sleep again
you want fucking rwby chibi?: @g  **(ง •̀_•́)ง**
Matt (mattmyers25): I am pissed off at my former employer. They are telling unemployment things they never told me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): O.o What the hell? Like they are saying false things about you?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Or like saying things to them about why they fired your they never said to you?
Matt (mattmyers25): The second 1. Saying I didn't work to the best of my ability and lack of judgement costed them money
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What the actual hell is wrong with that place.  But like how does that affect your unemployment?
Matt (mattmyers25): Idk. I won't find out until Tuesday next week
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Geez...  well good luck
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😭 possible RIP to my cute tshirt I just got at ANYC.. I spilled coffee on it and it's a fucking white tshirt 😩 ~~hoping the spray/wash and washing immediately gets it out and it doesnt stain~~
Jess (whoozica): oh no! spray and wash is usually pretty good! dawn brand dish soap is good for stains too!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Spray and wash usually gets stains out of everything for us hoping it works this time too but dad said coffee is tricky >.< ~~I knew I should have got one for everyday lmao~~
Jess (whoozica): yea coffee is weird, it seems to come out fine for me but i dont put sugar or milk in it so that might be why
