Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hey guys I need some hella good vibes and positivity thrown my way. I’m stressing hardcore because my parents decided to do my room change over now and that involves moving my craft room and bedroom all in one room.
Issue is I won’t be able to work on Pyrrha during this so I probably won’t have her done for RTX
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m also this close to taking off today so I can focus solely on crafting
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And take a mental health day because yesterday was NOT fun...
Erik (slendergiant): 
Matt (mattmyers25): (Hugs)
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): GOOD VIBES!!
