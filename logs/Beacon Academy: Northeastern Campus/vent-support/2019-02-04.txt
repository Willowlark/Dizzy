Georgia (Something Sensible): Ugh one bathroom to five guys is so annoying
Georgia (Something Sensible): I can’t shower in the mornings sometimes
Georgia (Something Sensible): Definitely looking forward to sharing a bathroom with only one person
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~when I read five guys I first thought of the food place xD~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~and  is it says girls LOL~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): I know that was my brain autotyping
Rebecca (madameterralupus): LOL
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I told Kesha and Surabhi I have to shower earlier than them because it takes 30 mins to dry my hair
Georgia (Something Sensible): And their hairs short so it air dries
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And they jumped in before ya?
Georgia (Something Sensible): _looked me dead in the eyes and jumped in_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ruuuddeeee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wack them with ya wet hair
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like they shower early so they can sit in their room for 40 mins and go to class
Georgia (Something Sensible): I shower early so I can blow dry my hair and do make up and the whole 9 yards
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oof it’s just a bad start to my day
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe discuss about someone showering  at night? 😮 
And oof. Hopefully your day gets better
Anna (loud and likely blonde): talk to them maybe they dont know how long your hair takes to wash
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~and if they just being jerks hide their shampoo~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): maybe they're annoyed at something you did accidentally and are just being petty?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Well this morning I waited for the shower after Kesha (on time) and Surabhi is like “oh I need to shower before you” and I we both have 10:20 class, and I told her “but I take longer to get ready” and she just darts in after Kesha gets out
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like???
Georgia (Something Sensible): They don’t interact with the rest of the suite usually
Georgia (Something Sensible): We think they might be secretly in lesbians
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's pretty rude. I'd talk to them about it later and try to sort it out. Has this been an issue before?
Jess (whoozica): if they are dating they can shower together
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You right lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): Nah tho Kesha thinks I leave the bathroom dirty when I’m really the only one who cleans it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): :eyeroll:
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~how tf do you shower with more than one person like srs someone answer that i need ELBOW ROOM~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Jess (whoozica): you dont
Georgia (Something Sensible): :Lenny:
Jess (whoozica): its like lone peson gets the stream of matter at a time
Anna (loud and likely blonde): NO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): give me my hot water
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): maybe its better in a rich person show with all the jets from different angles
Jess (whoozica): ususlly showering together isnt actually for getting clean
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it's doable. the difficult part is shimmying past each other to swap who gets to rinse off
Jess (whoozica): YEA
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^
Georgia (Something Sensible): For tall guys, you get up close and personal with their nipples and shimmy by
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😂
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ☝
Anna (loud and likely blonde): and then they knock their head on the shower head anyways
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ☝
Jess (whoozica): ~~or people around the same height its just rubbing genitals together on the way past each other~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😏 <:lenny:456549338026344489> <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~for tall people it's rubbing genitals on tummies~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): isnt the together shower  for u doing that anyways
Georgia (Something Sensible): _dick in the bellybutton_
Jess (whoozica): pretty much
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yike
Erik (Red Riot Thot): literally tho
Anna (loud and likely blonde): unless u got no dick involved.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _dick appears_
Anna (loud and likely blonde): then its just. titty touching
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -internally screaming- <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Jess (whoozica): its not the best though, especially if you pay the bill cuz then you are like "every second we are in here is costing us unnecessary money lets just go to the bed
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i mean u right a phallic object probably appears at some point
Anna (loud and likely blonde): YEA like GIVE ME MY HOT WATER
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how do ppl agree on a temperature
Erik (Red Riot Thot): you don't
Georgia (Something Sensible): You’ve heard of flappy bird, now get ready for slidey boob
Jess (whoozica): yea its also very slippery and can be like really dangerous
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the guy suffers through 3rd degree burns
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i want my skin to peel off but. on average men want. it cooler.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ...any time ive showered with someone, the water has been too cold for me and its just suffering
Anna (loud and likely blonde): this is why solo hot baths are great
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): showers are meant for one
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i firmly stand by that
Georgia (Something Sensible): All three men I’ve been able to agree on a temperature wut
Jess (whoozica): i ussually shower hotter than tom
Anna (loud and likely blonde): where do u find these men georgia
Anna (loud and likely blonde): how

Georgia (Something Sensible): 1. The internet 
2. Katsucon 
3. Physics <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~i personally want my flesh to melt off my bones so i can start the next skeleton war~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the average body contains more than one skeleton
Jess (whoozica): mood
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): anna, i have some questions
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): what the fuck

Georgia (Something Sensible): They just left, watching me dry my hair, knowing they made me late
Anna (loud and likely blonde): jerks.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao this was not the conversation I was expecting to come back to after class xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Also yea showering with people is weird. It's a lot of trying to maneuver around, genitals awkwardly rubbing and water hogging by one person while the other freezes~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~its even worse in a stall shower~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I thought this was going to be a valid conversation, instead it’s just lewd. I’m disappointed.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lmao what the fuck Leanna~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>

Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> i cant get into my amazon account
Georgia (Something Sensible): Never again will I say “sex” or “the diddle”
Georgia (Something Sensible): It is only lewdgistics now
