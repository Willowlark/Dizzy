Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I am going to have even more back pain cause for some odd reason lately whenever I have deep pockets in pants lately I unintentionally slouch and walk around like Qrow XD~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This train conductor clearly has no idea what heâ€™s doing.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Trains shouldnâ€™t bounce.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜±
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Train is actually stopped.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I didnâ€™t hear why.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Fuck.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Do you ever put a bagel in the toaster and then sit and wait for it to pop for TEN MINUTES before realizing that the toaster isnâ€™t plugged it. Thatâ€™s how my morning is starting off
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If it helps you feel better, I just got bombarded with work that I have to do this week and still have to break it to my boss that I also need to take a personal day Wednesday so I only have two days to get it all done ðŸ™ƒ
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but an untoasted bagel is pretty rough too, I'm sorry
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You didnâ€™t need sleep right?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): depending on how much I can get done, I might stay a little late and come in early tomorrow
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but that means more time away from my Eevee ðŸ˜­
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): NOt EEVEE
Jess (whoozica): OK so im laughing at the irony of this situation but my co worker was like "we need these posters by tomorrow" so normally i would go drop off the file and then pick up the poster at staples but i dont have my car, because the windshield is shattered, because i couldn't get home in snowstorm, cus they wouldn't let us out earlier.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): HA
Tom (tomukuncosplay): FUK EM
Jess (whoozica): ~~karma bitches~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I don't know how big business works and whatnot but one of our customers wants us to lower some of our prices for some of their products. It's a branch of a really big company whose Market Cap is $112.5B... like, do you *really* need us to lower our prices *that much*?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But I've been tasked with doing time studies to see where we can improve our process so we can make it faster
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And I *really* don't want to
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Because it involves interacting with people on the shop floor...
Jess (whoozica): UGH that sounds terrible
Erik (Red Riot Thot): another reason why we're probably going to go out of business ðŸ™ƒ
Matt (mattmyers25): I may have a job interview lined up
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Noice!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I high key don't have the energy or mental capacity to deal with a child this week... yet here I am ðŸ™ƒ 
~~I just wanted peace and quiet while my parents were away...~~
