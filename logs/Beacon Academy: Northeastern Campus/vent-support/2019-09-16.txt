Rebecca (madameterralupus): Back from con and I have a group presentation to do tomorrow but... the group never sent me the project to put my info in over the weekend -.-' So yayy now I get to go bitch to the professor
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: F
at least you did your part?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yep... I have a small bit to finish up tonight but 🤷🏻‍♀️ no where to put it now. So emailing my prof later and telling her I won't be presenting with them and the situation. Hoping I can present alone another day. Like I even told them I'd be out of town a few days/the weekend several times to send me link to presi and I'll do my part 😑
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: that sucks. like you DID it its not like u just shirked your part
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They seemed like they'd do this when  joined them. Cause they were all buddy buddy... 🙃 but I'll figure it out.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is why I hate group projects... cause people are assholes
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: indcredible. Like youd think theyd love someone who would do part and then literally not talk to them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Welp they're deff getting the not talking to them part now ✌🏻
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't even have a way to contact them on it cause they gave me no contact info since said would send docs link... and I'm just over it. They aren't getting my part now.
