Monica (absolutezerocosplay): oof
ZombieHunter: End me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I am excited to have a week to not have to deal with my parents (they are going to visit family in Texas) but at the same time I am not. I am too scared to stay home alone (gives me bad anxiety attacks) so I am stuck with having my moms friend stay with me. She's nice but kind of annoying at times cause she's an older lady and ya'll know how older ladies like to chat, etc... She's mostly gonna be here in the evenings with me cause I am mostly bad at night when staying home alone. So I'll probs eat dinner with her and maybe chat some. Well tonight I mentioned I gotta find someone to let dog out Saturday evening since I might be out late with friends (she's unable to do it cause health)... my mom goes well what's Brenda supposed to do? ... I'm sorry?? I didn't know I had to cancel hanging with my friends during my fall break weekend to hang with her >.> Not really planning to aside from mostly dinner at night and a small chatting to be nice... 
High key wish I didn't have such bad anxiety and/or someone closer to stay with me. Not excited for a week stuck with my moms friend .~.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I wish I could be there for you :/
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thank friend >.<
If I didn't have to watch the dog this would be much easier cause I'd go stay with my bro or a friend but alas ðŸ¤·
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's rough too cause I use to be able to depend on one of two people to stay with me in the past but contact has been cut with both so womp that ain't happening :\
ZombieHunter: Where are you at <@!169297844874903552> ?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm based in Lancaster lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~plans for next week include hibernating in the basement crafting if not at school or work cause ehh~~
ZombieHunter: Aw
ZombieHunter: If I had money for gas I would try to halp
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thank friend. I appreciate it
ZombieHunter: You are always welcome to request voice parties!
ZombieHunter: Iâ€™m like. Always online.
Marisa (Weeb): what does a person do if their self-loathing and anxiety is preventing them from doing literally anything
