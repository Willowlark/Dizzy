Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> I want Dr. Woodall back asap. I forgot my partner and I have to not only just record the radio segment tomorrow but also decide the order they go in fully. Usually the class all helps decide the order with him mostly doing large chunk of it. Ahhhh I hope we do everything okay
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜‚ So my partner believes my professor cancelled class not for a conference but to just go see his girlfriend in Texas. LMAO.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I mean yea I'd do the same ol~~
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Why is it so hard to get my friggin prescription pick up location changed? Dealing with health insurance makes me want to rip my hair out
