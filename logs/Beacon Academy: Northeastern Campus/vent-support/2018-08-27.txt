Rebecca (madameterralupus): I love that my laptop is just breaking more and more as time goes on.... first the "g" and "h" keys stop working (i have em copied to paste for typing) and now my tab key is trying to come off -.- I wanna tell my parents about it so they can help me look and maybe get me another new one for christmas but i
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd get a new one myself but sadly it'd take most of my savings and I don't get paid enough to build up a second savings for one by the time I need... 😭 the struggle is real ugh
Georgia (Something Sensible): If I see any college students posting about selling some secondhand on the Rutgers FB I'll let you know!
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sometimes they'll give them good discounts and might be in your price range
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thanks! That could work for me until I can afford a new one or not be scared to tell my dad about it shitting out on me 😫
Erik (slendergiant): You could also look into a wireless keyboard. You can probably get one relatively cheap. Not the most convenient fix, but it's cheaper than a new computer altogether
Erik (slendergiant): https://www.bestbuy.com/site/logitech-mk270-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse-black/1440638.p?skuId=1440638
Erik (slendergiant): $20 wireless keyboard/mouse combo
Erik (slendergiant): I once fried my keyboard with a static shock to the fingerprint scanner and having the wireless was a lifesaver
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Matt mentioned that and it's gonna be my last resort cause I never wanted to do that XDD Seems high key annoying buuuutt wireless might not be too bad since no annoying cord lol. 
I may see if someone I know can look at it and fix the issues too.  It's not too bad just 2 keys don't work (mostly frustrating) and the key that popped up today I never use so I may just super glue down 😂 
I am mostly just worried about more breaking on it before I can get a new one 😫
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Thanks for the help! If I can't find anyone who can look/fix it I may look into the wireless until can get a whole new laptop lol. I can manage with that for a few months XD
