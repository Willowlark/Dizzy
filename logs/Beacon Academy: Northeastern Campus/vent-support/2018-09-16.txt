Marisa (Weeb): I didn’t get to do even a fraction of what I wanted to today because it was so crowded and I barely got a spot to see at the yabusame festival and at the last minute some late people came up to the front and basically booted me out of most of my space that I occupied for two and a half hours while waiting but at least I got some sweet slo-mo video of people on horses. 🏇
Marisa (Weeb): iPhone slow mo video is wonderful and I’m gonna post it to my story once I get home
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oof 😰
