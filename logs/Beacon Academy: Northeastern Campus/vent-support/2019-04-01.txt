Anna (Blonde Banshee): Someone managed to wreck so bad on the hutch the whole road is closed. In like. The Bronx.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): There is no exit
Anna (Blonde Banshee): 
Anna (Blonde Banshee): They dead turning us all around
Jamie (Jamie): Yikes is that the only way out then literally?
Anna (Blonde Banshee): Yep. Now dwtoriijg though placed. Where this amount of traffic was not planned for
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Hi 
I'm aro 
That's a thing 
It was a thing I was out about before I went to college 
Then I shoved it deep down into the closet during the end of my senior year cause I dont like saying no and pressure and other things 
But now I wanna be out about it again 
And yeah 
Also 
I'm kinda already expecting people questioning it and stuff cause of my long ass relationship with Georgia 
But like 
That shit, while it worked out for a while, worked cause of a really unhealthy way of my self imposed defining what a relationship should be, cause I dont get romantic love at all. 
Last bit of premature commenting on this 
Cause I know people make assumptions 
Ask me questions about it 
Dont make assumptions about why X happened or the reason things went down the way they did for me and whomever 
Just like 
Ask me 
Especially if you have questions about the aro thing in general, cause I get it's hard for a lot of people to wrap their heads around
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No one knows you better than you Hal. If you’re accepting yourself as aro, then of course I’d accept it too. People constantly change as they grow and learn about themselves, I’m not going to judge you on past actions for how you’ve changed now. Be who you are.
Mark (Mad Doctor): ^^this^^
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'll be honest I had to look up what Aro was because I forgot. But hey we accept you for you Hal. ❤ And I agree with Bill's comment as well. No one knows you better than you do. 😃
Anna (Blonde Banshee): That shit's also hard to figure out for yourself (gray aro gray ace over here so hell of a mood) but we're here for you and all that. You know you best.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): It may not have meant to come off hostile, but the way it was read feels defensive. I don't usually try to speak for everyone but, I think in this situation it's valid. 
Everyone here is not judging you, a lot of us are LGBTQ+ ourselves, and a lot even are on the ace or aro spectrum! It's scary to come out about it, especially after being a relationship with someone who's a big part of this server, but we genuinely are not here to judge you. It's great that you are being open with us and even more so with yourself! 
This is a big step for anyone, you should be proud of yourself for accepting yourself, and we will all be here to support you!
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~every printer in our office is pulling some bullshit today hELP~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): APRIL FOOLS! Your prints are messed up! 😄
Erik (Red Riot Thot): > Your office: Can... can you not? 😒

Kurtis (Beardedelf94): They've become aware just to fuck with you
Anna (Blonde Banshee): *HOLY FUCK THE VERRAZANO BRIDGE TOLL WENT UP TO $19 CASH PRICE*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes. That's a lot
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): holy fuck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): WHY THO
Anna (Blonde Banshee): like its $12-something WITH ezpass but JFC
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ITS NOW THE MOST EXPENSIVE TOLL IN THE USA
Anna (Blonde Banshee): it beats a 20-something mile tunnel
Erik (Red Riot Thot): don't you live in Staten Island?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): That rate is supposed to be $5.50
Jess (whoozica): i think she live on long island ?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oooh right
Erik (Red Riot Thot): got my islands mixed up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ouch.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~dont worry they both suck ass its not like i have talked about either in positive light~~
Anna (Blonde Banshee): its quite easy to get confused. One is full of self centered people. One is full of self centered Italian people.
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ~~apologies to any italians here but long island italians are. different~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): they remind me of my family, and thats not a good thing
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol do we have anyone in with Italian in their ancestry cause like idk XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): me
Anna (Blonde Banshee): it ok i fuckin hate it here
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ITS SO FLAT. EVERYONE IS SO FAKE
Anna (Blonde Banshee): S O  M U C H  F A K E
Anna (Blonde Banshee): like we talking i cant stand the way some of these ppl talk because of how insincere and *fake* they are
Anna (Blonde Banshee): and shallow
Anna (Blonde Banshee): and. 
*privileged without understanding how much privilege they have*
Anna (Blonde Banshee): *like  people here are okay with not knowing things*
Anna (Blonde Banshee): also  all the dirt is sandy so i hate it
Anna (Blonde Banshee): ah that felt good to say. but rlly like. finding ppl with depth is... hard here.... thank god for nerds
Mark (Mad Doctor): My boss is a polite, well-educated, witty gay man from Long Island. He has not been back there in three decades
Anna (Blonde Banshee): yeah he escaepd
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have a massive fucking headache from so much damn stress... I want to jsut scream. Like why is it anytime I feel like I am doing well soemthing negative comes to bite me in the ass??
Anna (Blonde Banshee): Well I'm mad. Ordered the bnha uniforms off Amazon and even tho I like quadruple checked what size I would fit in.... The large MENS is too small for me. Like it says it should fit me by like 2" extra
Anna (Blonde Banshee): No. It's fucking small as shit. And there's probs no returns bc it came from China. So I guess I'm gonna have to order an XXL and take it in. 
That probs means my girls uniform won't fit either.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yikes that really sucks D:
Anna (Blonde Banshee): The fucking pants have a 34" waist.... They sent me a medium pants with a large jacket -_-
Anna (Blonde Banshee): I'm ordering from a different company ffs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wooow. I would deff at least message them and inform them of their error.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also doesn't hurt to try and see if you can return it or get a refund
Anna (Blonde Banshee): I messaged them. Worst case I just. Give it to mag
Anna (Blonde Banshee): She's way smaller than me and was gonna get one eventually
Anna (Blonde Banshee): But like. How incredibly inconvenient. 
On the other hand I just found one on Amazon prime I'm gonna get that one now instead
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm like, really hesitant ordering costumes off Amazon
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But mostly because I probably need custom sizing regardless
Rebecca (madameterralupus): How much did you end up spending on the costume Anna? 😮 
If it was around $40 you could go to Miccostumes. That's where I got mine. Decent priced and fairly quick shipping too. Mine fit really well. I think they do custom measurements too?
