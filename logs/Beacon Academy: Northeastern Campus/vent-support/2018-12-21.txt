Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah I remember them being like $60 and thinking how expensive that was, now it's like *yeesh*
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Ya know one day I'm gonna make q mecha cosplay
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): But i also want to make a frankenflannel costume
Jess (whoozica): yea my parents hated me cuz id use my whole back to school budget in hot topic and come out with like 3 things
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): And I'll be glad to know that if somebody asks me what my most expensive cosplay is
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): I can point at the frankenflannel
Jess (whoozica): in my defence, my middle school banned large backpacks and i needed pocket space
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jess, this is why everyone confused us, we dressed the same

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): smol emos in com arts
Jess (whoozica): a force to be reckoned with
Matt (mattmyers25): My former employer is appealing my unemploymemt. I am angry, like just drop it and move on
Jess (whoozica): WTF?! damn what a bunch of assholes
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 1. Hair hot topic wants me to be broke xD (I need that notebook lol)
2. What the hell is wrong with your old job?!
Matt (mattmyers25): Idk, feels like I am being targeted for no reason. Dont worry, I have heard 3 different reasons I was let go
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My mom said business will try to do that. Just keep fighting it
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Hal mentioned his most expensive cosplay and it got me thinking
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I did the math and I‚Äôve spent almost 1000$ on Pyrrha and that makes me want to through up
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like 90% of which is probably worbla
Erik (Red Riot Thot): But to be fair, it's over a period of a couple years and several iterations?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): This is the breakdown. I‚Äôve gotten 30+ wears out of her so I can‚Äôt be toooo mad. But still
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh wow, less than I expected for worbla
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 2jumbo sheets of worbla got my 7 sets of Pyrrha armor
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): So if your going to buy it the jumbo sheets are WORTH IT
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ay mama that corset price
Georgia (Something Sensible): Your corset is hella nice but the 300 dollar price tag activates my flight or fight response
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It was something I knew was good quality and that I didn‚Äôt have the skill to do (and tbh prob still don‚Äôt have) so I bit the bullet. That was also back when I was a bartender so that was like 2days worth of pay
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ((if that deku notebook doesnt have deku's actual notes and stuff inside it already its worthless to me u_u
you can buy the actual campos notebooks he uses on amazon for p cheap bulk iirc lol so thats just what i was gonna do))
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It looks like a blank notebook but some of the pages might have bits of his notes printed lightly
Erik (Red Riot Thot): https://hottopic.scene7.com/is/image/HotTopic/11376806_av1?$pdp_hero_zoom$
Erik (Red Riot Thot): And it looks like it's the same thing as the one on Amazon (just slightly cheaper)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): If this is what you're referring to: https://smile.amazon.com/JUST-FUNKY-Academia-Notebook-Collection/dp/B07L128HHW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1545424510&sr=8-1&keywords=deku+notebook
