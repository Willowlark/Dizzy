Erik (Red Riot Thot): Guess who forgot contact cement eats paint and might have fucked something up <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Jess (whoozica): Noooo! 😭
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Trying to add elastic to the inside of the gears... not sure it's going to work
Anna (Cadmium): Oh noooo at least it's hidden?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Yeah, the issue is more so my elastic might not hold as well. The first one i'm letting it dry longer before testing it. The second one I scored the shit out of with an X-acto in the area where I was applying it and that seemed to help
Anna (Cadmium): Interesting. Personally I sew the elastic to woven plastic strap (like backpack strap material) and then glue or sew the strap to the thing. It holds better cause no give.
Anna (Cadmium): Although last time I glued elastic with contact cement once it dried it's rock solid
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Can't really sew to EVA foam tho
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): …yeah you can
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Depending on the thickness
Erik (Red Riot Thot): For what I was doing, it couldn't be sewed
Georgia (Something Sensible): its like a garterbelt for your arm
Georgia (Something Sensible): ingenuitive 👌
Marisa (Mawisa): I’m at city hall and the numbers they’re calling went from 25 to 2026 and I’m number 331. City hall is wild.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): O.o
Marisa (Mawisa): I just noticed there’s also no window 7. There are two window 5s and three window 6’s which I’m waiting for and then it goes to 8.
Marisa (Mawisa): There go numbers 2032, 7058, and 26
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Seems pretty all over and messed up lol
Marisa (Mawisa): The magic of bureaucracy 🌈
Tom (tomukuncosplay): WAAAAAA
Tom (tomukuncosplay): That's wild
Jess (whoozica): Boss on friday (in an email): "I set aside 9:30 to 10:15 to discuss this matter"
Me (replies): "what day"
no reply

Boss today: "why arnt you in meeting?"
Me: "you never said what day"
Boss: "you should have asked"
Me: "....I did?"
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m like a little stupidly annoyed at something
Georgia (Something Sensible): A business class was gonna visit my moms dealership on Thursday so she had me make an itinerary and everything for it
Georgia (Something Sensible): And they were like “plan for 30 kids for 5 hours” and I made honestly a really cool schedule??
Georgia (Something Sensible): The high school (the same one I went to, that my sister goes to) emailed my mom today saying only 12 kids signed up for the trip so they would have to cancel
Marisa (Mawisa): That’s messed up and unprofessional of them
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like _these ungrateful little shits_
Georgia (Something Sensible): I dropped my sister off at school this morning too and at least 3 high school seniors almost hit me in the parking lot
Georgia (Something Sensible): High school kids are fuckin jerks
Mark (Mad Doctor): *welcome to my world...*
Georgia (Something Sensible): I considered doing my physics major to become a teacher for like half a day before I realized that I didn’t like high school kids when I WAS one
Georgia (Something Sensible): Much less when I’m older
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I've actually been surprisingly productive at work today. Like, I'm not getting as much done as I'd like but that's because what I'm doing is taking a while to do. But I'm working with new pneumatic tooling that we got in so I'm making sure everything works properly and it's at least not dull work
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I put my phone on Do Not Disturb and used the Forest app and grew 3 trees
Jess (whoozica): id be productive... but i just dont give a ahit XD
Anna (Cadmium): id be productive but i cant read my boss' redlines
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The things I want to goof off at work doing are on my macbook and not pushed to github. Or synchronized via anything. And my macbook isn't responding to teamviewer.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Anger.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So I kinda have a photographer who is being a bit pushy ATM

They reached out to me asking if I'd like to shoot with them. I'm told them I might have plans for Saturday evening and they keep pressing times that would work for a photoshoot 

I have four photoshoots at Katsu I'm not sure if I can stomach a 5th.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tell them no?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's all there is to it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They have no claim to your time.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I know and I'm telling them I might be doing the formal with friends or chilling
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also remember I'm too nice to flat out say no XD
Jess (whoozica): damn what a butt, is this a friend or just a rando?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~this the guy who did your Nora location shoot~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): A random person. Their ohotogeoahy is great I just know I'm gonna be tired at night 

~~no it's not XD~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'd screen shot the conversation to get feedback but SOME APP DECIDED TO UPDATE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If they're being pushy, I don't think it's worth the photos.
Jess (whoozica): if its going to stess you out then just tell them katsu is too stressful for you to squeeze them in
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I might just be sensitive and over reacting but ive never dealt with this before
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I find pushiness disrespectful ~~which is why I rarely suggest shoots~~.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ALSO if you use a computer you can screen cap the story when you watch on desktop.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~but Bill we love you boi~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): True I'm just at work >___<
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Thank but ye I'm uncomfortable asking for shoots, it's your cosplay time and person~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Totally valid
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I'm kinda flattered and I wanna help them get content but like I have no idea what is happening Saturday night
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ~~I think it's gonna be get trashed and have fun time and wear a wig and meme~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Omg
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I thought of an idea for Saturday shit
Anna (Cadmium): i heard get trashed and saturday
Anna (Cadmium): hello
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OwO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So ye do that. "Sorry, I won't be available to shoot then, I'll be PLASTERING MEMES ON THE WALL"
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I might do a rave Blake and just have fun 

MEMES ARE LAIFU
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Then only reply in memes.
Anna (Cadmium): plastering memes or plastered and memeing
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): why not both.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): BOTH
Anna (Cadmium): YES GOOD
Anna (Cadmium): i am looking forward to cosplay and alchoholing with yall
Anna (Cadmium): if u choose to partake in said alchohol
Anna (Cadmium): if you wish to not. 
I will probably have snacks or maybe a can of monster
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YES PLZ
I usually don't get too drunk at cons but I plan on memeing and getting tipsy
Anna (Cadmium): well im basically an alchoholic so whatever u do dont follow my  lead
Anna (Cadmium): i was PLASTERED at CCE last year at the rwby shoot
Anna (Cadmium): and i was pleasantly drunk at allstar
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The inner Winter in me is screaming but also M E MEING WHILE TIPSY
Anna (Cadmium): but that was at a wizard rave

Georgia (Something Sensible): i came across this gem
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): _i wonder what kind of person wrote this description_
Anna (Cadmium): ah. the male gaze
Evie (Katheryne Knight): O O F
Anna (Cadmium): side note brooooooooooooooooooo the vault dweller from NYCC who was in the contest two years ago had an incredible suit and an incredible butt
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEET that negativity out if here
Jess (whoozica): Wow
Anna (Cadmium): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): _where the butt tho anna_
Jess (whoozica): "anonymous cosplayer"
Anna (Cadmium): I DONT KNOW I CANT FIND MY OLD PICS
Anna (Cadmium): but like the announcer was like 'look at details on the sTITCHING. THE STITCHING." and was like exaggeratedly pointing at the leather armor
Anna (Cadmium): bc he knew everyone was screaming at the butt
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): _this dude bro doesnt even know that the official vault girl wears a headband_
Jess (whoozica): Fake nerd boi

Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): WOWEE
Anna (Cadmium): thats not even the best flex
Jess (whoozica): So much cringe I got like 5 down and he had allready said said "cute" for two different girls
Anna (Cadmium): go look at the nice butt Jess
Anna (Cadmium): appreciate the aesthetic of  good glutes
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wait
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i know that guy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LmAO
Jess (whoozica): <:shocked_pikachu:511737009610424351>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): damn
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): DAMN
Anna (Cadmium): dont tell him we're all looking at videos from two years ago of his butt
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): he does photos for a cat rescue
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like scandelous pics
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): with cats
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMFaO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh my god
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i think they do calendars?
Jess (whoozica): OMG
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i have no idea why else he would be posing scandelously with kittens
Anna (Cadmium): is it like the firefighters and puppies calendars
Anna (Cadmium): is this a market
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Anna (Cadmium): cosplayers and cats
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): how do we also hop on that market
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because 👀
Anna (Cadmium): we find an animal shelter that needs some advertising
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i wanna take pics with cats
Anna (Cadmium): and we ask if we can do photoshoots with their pets to raise awarness of how many pets need adopting
Anna (Cadmium): i wanna take pics with cats
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BNE, cat rescue
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I was thinking about doing that (just photographing the animals) if I could find a place recently.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~also dogs~~
Anna (Cadmium): honestly go to a kill shelter because theyre forced to take any animal that ends up there
Anna (Cadmium): they dont like having to kill pets but theyre labeled as evil but really get the most pets cause they have to take them
Georgia (Something Sensible): BNE ANIMAL SHELTER CALENDAR LETS GO
Anna (Cadmium): IM DOWN
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): can we actually look into this
Anna (Cadmium): ~~all proceeds go to shelters?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~And what happened to the last calendar idea you had~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): cause that would be incredible
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): also yea all proceeds go to the shelter
Anna (Cadmium): who cares about other calendars like this is a great idea
Anna (Cadmium): er. rather all profits go to shelters
Anna (Cadmium): so we dont have to front for paper n stuff
Georgia (Something Sensible): I had a calendar idea?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I recall you did.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Rather than a calendar getting social media notice for the shelter is probably more valuable.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): both
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): if one of the mindless drones who follow Georgia happens to want a pet, they'll have a way to look.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _mindless drones who follow georgia, they follow other people too_
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i befriended the guy who runs the rwbycosplay account i can have him advertise too~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): shelters need the money and also social media presence
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so its like a double win
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~until one of them adopts a pet to impress the cosplayer in the photo and tries to get brownie points because of it~~
Anna (Cadmium): WHAT IF THEY HAVE GERMAN SHEPARDS WE CAN DO FALLOUT WITH
Georgia (Something Sensible): hnnNNNGNGNH
Georgia (Something Sensible): yesssssssss
Anna (Cadmium): i mean. the perecntage of mindless drones close enough to adopt from THAT shelter would be relatively low i hope
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~i hope~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i mean they also have a screening process
Anna (Cadmium): and thankfully shelters do an incredible amount of like. background checks these days
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so i dont think theyd see a weeb and be like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yea sir
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): pick whatever one you want
Anna (Cadmium): they have to call references and shit and it takes like a week
Georgia (Something Sensible): one would hope that people would be motivated to donate to or adopt from their own shelters lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Calendars have a material and shipping cost as well, to take into account. For that part of it you'd need a service that can handle that or to take those costs and time into account.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not to say it's a bad idea, if someone has a hosting shelter in mind I'd be happy to give them a call and ask about it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But being practical.
Anna (Cadmium): can we do it via like. zazzle?
Anna (Cadmium): but i would prefer we do something like small batches and then sell them on etsy or through a service
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Etsy you'd need to have them printed yourself.
Anna (Cadmium): theres gotta be ones you can upload designs and they take a cut but you get paid when ppl buy your design
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's the idea.
Anna (Cadmium): yea we would have to do small batches for etsy
Anna (Cadmium): but ive never sold on zazzle
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Or *kickstart* it for the lols.
Anna (Cadmium): lol but. we could do this for 2020 cause. we have time
Anna (Cadmium): omg wait we could do an advent calendar of prints if we have extra pics
Mark (Mad Doctor): Cool idea. I happen to have a shelter dog living in my house who needs a home...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): For once. I would like if my dad can leave my stuff alone and not move. Mostly tired of the stuff in my car being moved around...
