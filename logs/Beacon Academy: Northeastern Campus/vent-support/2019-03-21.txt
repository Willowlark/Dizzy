Evie (Katheryne Knight): You know I should have known that I was gonna get shit for wearing Rin because she's so popular. -___-
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes I'm definitely a dude. Fear me mongrel
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Half the reason I hate not wearing make up with costests is because I look hella masculine and I hate it but I'm too tired half the time to do my make up for costests
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> why are people like this. You don't look like a dude! Like how rude can people be >.> geez
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ngl I tried to get into the Fate cosplay fandom around the same time I got into RWBY. They’re pretty elitist and unfriendly compared to RWBY.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof makes me not wanna get into the fate fandom now >.<
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Admittedly I wasn’t cosplaying and photographers (especially male, overweight ones walking around alone with big cameras) get a pretty bad rap immediately. Buuuuut despite efforts the only people I hit it off with were crossovers with RWBY.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I've been into Fate for a while, and I only cosplayed Jeanne once (last year at Zenkai) but I didn't run into any problems. The guy who runs the Fate shoots in the area is really cool. Just my experience tho, there are definitely toxic people out there.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): My experiences with the cosplay fandom are just memes to cope with feels. Online it's fuckbois jacking it to their waifus
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So it's to be expected I was gonna get comments like that because I'm not a small, Japanese model
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Wasnt fate originally supposed to be a hentai
but aso like. wow that dude can kiss my ass what if you were a guy
Anna (loud and likely blonde): who cares
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fate is originally an eroge.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So yeah it was a sexually explicit visual novels
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): WAAAYYYY back when it wasn't a cash cow franchise with 20+ versions of Saber.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~will i regret looking up that word at work~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): eroge is slang for erotic game.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But a lot of westren exposer was via Fate/Zero and the OG 2006 anime ~~that was REALLY bad~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Then UBW came out, F:GO, and some other games were brought to the US
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And now Heavens Feel
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That said, Gen described it better. Fate has a deep storyline and plot going on with a handful of ~~extremely poorly drawn~~ sex scenes. Eroge usually refers to 'a maid fell from the sky and said she wants to fuck me day in and out'.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah that's what put Fate apart from other Eroge
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *takes notes* 📝
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Is despite the sex it was actually a complex story line
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wow thats rare
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The original Fate game is good, but they beat the series to death... god, around the 10th anniversary? By that point they should have just made a sequel.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Not rare, but uncommon.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Which is why type moon was like, 'hey Les expand on this shit because it's actually kinda good"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Type moon has other good properties. They expand on Fate these days cause they don't have to design new characters, they just glue saber onto a new body. <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like the fact historical figures fight against each other I'm a war for the Holy Grail to Grant you a wish of your choice
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wait historical figures
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i love that shit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Surprise, half of them are hot anime girls now.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): *is my assassins creed showing*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Where else can you find King Arthur and a Celtic Myth fighting each other along with freaking Alexander the Great and Gilgamesh having a air plane battle with Lancelot in a Berserk form
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): King Arthur?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hot girl.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Jack the ripper?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Loli girl.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): wait is this the one where Pol Pot is like. a hot anime girl and like i was visibly disgusted
Evie (Katheryne Knight): But Diramund
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i saw it on a trading card
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Hor guy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He's just
Evie (Katheryne Knight): UMOH
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Actuall Gen, have you seen Fate/Prototype? Back when Saber wasn't genderbent?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Worth looking up.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah whherw saber is Daddy material?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Uuuuummmph
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The fate series: everyone is hot except for 3 people
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It was the original idea Nasu had for Fate, but it got scrapped ~~cause they thought it wouldn't sell without waifus~~. Fate is so big now they're making material for it. I think there's a manga, and a 10 minute extended 'trailer' that'll never go anywhere.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm enjoying Zero and UBW. 

Also being a.weeb and playing Grand Order
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): UBW is best route hands down.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also here is husband
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Garcher.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh hes hot
Evie (Katheryne Knight): They all are the
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *tbh
Evie (Katheryne Knight): 90% of the characters are eye candy
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Most lancers tend to be hot and.from Celtic Mythos
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and to appeal to the cosplayer, armor builds are available.
Jess (whoozica): yes hello im here for the man with the exposed shoulder
Jess (whoozica): also fuck that jerk up there, you look beautiful <@!229713389511901185>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ^ And NICU picking best girl Rin.
Mark (Mad Doctor): I watched UBW with no foreknowledge or expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised that what I thought would be high school fluff turned out to be something more serious. Kinda glad they downplayed the smut factor. I think it would have undermined the tone (and since I usually watch anime at the gym, I wouldn't want to be "that pervy guy on the treadmill")
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): UBW was the least erotic route. Fate (Saber route) has another scene or two. Heaven's Feel is like an orgy. ~~I don't like heaven's feel much, never played the route~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): UBW is the only one to get a 'after the end' bit as well, last I checked. The UBW route is closest to a true ending for the original game.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😫 welp today's just a bad day... almost got side swiped by an 18 wheeler that didn't know how to drive and kept veering into my lane... and then almost re-ended a lady who stopped abruptly who needed into another lane on an exit ramp... and now Mother Nature has graced me.

Jess (whoozica): do what i do! and just dont believe in luck 🍀
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao honestly anymore... I don't
Jamie (Jamie): According to asshat coworker i have smug satisfaction because i simply tried to make conversation over what appears to be replacment shirts for a job we did the other day where i thought i noticed something the customer might end up getting fixed with an xs being bigger than the smalls in the job. Like fuck off
Jess (whoozica): be like "yea i do have smug satisfaction cuz i coulda saved us time and money but you didnt listen to me soo TOLD YA SO"
Jamie (Jamie): And i could be like that too and be a total bitch about it but i wasnt i was just making conversation and trying to see if i could confirm a curiosity but nah I'm def smug bitch

Georgia (Something Sensible): _zenkai will be a tornado of emotions and blood_
Mark (Mad Doctor): (That makes Audrey a true BNE member, I believe)
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yes it does. and if u dont bleed like that bc u do not have the organs. 
stabbing yourself accidentally grants u that title also
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I had it last con. I barely lasted 2 hours wearing Winter. Here's hoping I have a little more luck this con.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): got mine late at NYCC this year and literally had cold sweats bc of how bad cramps were. i was bundled up in sweltering heat and everyone was like u ok im like. im cold
