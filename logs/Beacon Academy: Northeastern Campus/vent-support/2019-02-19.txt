Erik (Red Riot Thot): Anyone else having the issue on Instagram where you take a photo and it rotates and zooms automatically for no reason?

Rebecca (madameterralupus): You got this 💪
Mark (Mad Doctor): Bon chance!
Jess (whoozica): Good luck!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Two new hires start today.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): One's relatively new, but the other was hired 'senior', despite the fact that my current team and I basically said she doesn't seem to have the knowledge we want to learn from a senior.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Buena suerte!
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Lord help me if she tries to manage me, despite being new and not my manager.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~or maybe lord help her~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is gonna be a fun presentation. I'm exhausted and can't focus still from the con still, also these two group members act like they have  basically kicked me out of the group...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I went to do my final touches on the power point this morning since I passed out last night and they had taken it over??
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I used to just have CAO COPRA and CAO Non Billable. 

What the fuck.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Wtf I slept 7.5 hours why am I tired
Anna (loud and likely blonde): My neck still hurts from 2 ponytail wigs why
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ,... I'm senior person here. I can't just keep my headphones on while the new hires setup their laptops.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oof.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~glad I still carry airpods with my noise cancelling ones~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Also this 'senior' consultant is complaining about how she doesn't want to set up her monitor because she doesn't get it. 

I?

Nani?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~wtf its just a monitor~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~patience is not a virtue of mine~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~the wtf was directed at little miss senior consultant~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh I know. it's not getting better.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): oh god
Anna (loud and likely blonde): does she have like. a trial run
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So long as she doesn't try to order me around at some point cause she has more experience, it's fine. I can tolerate some incompetence. I'm not perfect either.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ....a probation period. 
Trial run anna??? seriously????
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But I don't do orders from someone I don't respect.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It has.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): caused issues before.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): either way its not a good sign if shes not willing to set up her own monitor
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Flashback to hijacking the anime club from it's incompetent president in a flashy, showy way~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you too are a 'i care about this too much to let this dumpster fire burn' person i see.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Only if I need to get inside that dumpster.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): A bad analogy.

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~trash belongs in the trash~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): at least  you do it from still outside the dumpster im usually in the dumpster fire bc i thought it was only a small amount of smoke
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No no no this is MY dumpster already. She’s coming in here to stumble around a burn it down.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i have too many trash cans on fire to do anything else
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): W H A T a mood.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): IBM is like a dump, filled with trash cans, with them all on fire, and middle management all trying to blame it on each other.

Erik (Red Riot Thot): So last week I started having a weird issue where hyperlinks on our company intranet that link to PDFs opens a download box instead of just opening in the browser (Chrome). I checked the browser settings and Acrobat settings and they all say that PDFs should open in the browser. I tried other browsers (IE and Firefox) and it works like it should. I tried Chrome on another computer and it works like it should. So that leads me to believe that it's specifically Chrome on my computer that isn't working right. So I uninstall and reinstall it. Still nothing. So moral of the story is that I lost my well-organized bookmarks bar for no reason.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): chrome sync?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I didn't have my bookmarks linked to an account
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It was due for a cleanup anyway
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So I might not be going to Zenkaikon now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): The weekend I need to switch is already taken
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im just waiting patiently until they can figure out if I can get covered
Jess (whoozica): Oh no! 😭
Mark (Mad Doctor): Fingers crossed...
Matt (mattmyers25): So, the state of PA requested me for a job interview
Anna (loud and likely blonde): One of my housemates knocked over my cement and a full fuckin quart leaked all over the floor so I just spent a half hour peeling it off the hardwood
Jess (whoozica): OH NO
Anna (loud and likely blonde): SO MUCH LOST CEMENT
Anna (loud and likely blonde): How they didn't smell it i don't know
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): 😬😬😬😬
