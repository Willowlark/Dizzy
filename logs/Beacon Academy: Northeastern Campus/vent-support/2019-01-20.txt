Anna (Cadmium): Ugh I gotta get the electric bill in my name now. Housemate moved out
Anna (Cadmium): I gotta order more oil too
Jess (whoozica): Adulting is hard üò≠
Anna (Cadmium): Small victories. Took cat to vet. Continued my insurance claim. Mailed thing to mag, Reiley, and Leanna
Mark (Mad Doctor): Wish I could say that it gets easier as you age, but...
Jess (whoozica): Whoo! Good job
Anna (Cadmium): The fucker responded hoooooooo I am too sober for this and I'm 6 ciders in
Anna (Cadmium): 
Anna (Cadmium): MEDIA IS A REFLECTION OF SOCIETY JFC
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh my God
Anna (Cadmium): I'm not responding fuck that
Anna (Cadmium): Like I'm not going crazy right
Anna (Cadmium): This is some bullshit
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): No theyre just really awful
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Homophobia at its finest
Anna (Cadmium): Whelp. Gonna put him on watch then. 
Although like okay. Maybe he does think the writing is forced. But. 
Like. If it was a straight ship it would have happened like season 3
Anna (Cadmium): *holy fuck he put on blue contacts and he looks like actual Adam*
Anna (Cadmium): I'm out
Anna (Cadmium): IM OUT
Anna (Cadmium): 
Anna (Cadmium): IM OUT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Jesus
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Christ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's just adam
Anna (Cadmium): Wow he agreed Adam is abusive but was kind of hoping Adam had some redemption not death. 
Nah mate. There was no redeeming that
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oof
Anna (Cadmium): Someone who can actually see at cons make sure we don't run into this guy
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh hes from around here ish?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yikes
Anna (Cadmium): I don't know and I don't wanna ask
Anna (Cadmium): Please take this soothing picture of my cat with toe beans
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think I missed the CisHet Men's meeting where we voted ourselves the right to define gay relationships. My apologies for the douchebags who apparently attended.

I can see Bumblebee moving slowly from this point. Both Blake and Yang have been wounded emotionally and physically and would be understandably hesitant to move on. I can also see the relationship progressing quickly: both women have worked to get to a position of health and clarity, and events around them might lead to a sense of urgency. Will be fun to see it unfold
Anna (Cadmium): See you're sensible which is obviously not what they are lmao.
Anna (Cadmium): And YES thank you that is the words I was missing
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm VERY excited to see their relationship grow. 

Renora and Bumblby double date night anyone?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like I think that would be cute as FUCK
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ten and Nora as The Old Married Couple‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and Blake and Yand as The Awkward New Couple‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yes please XD
Anna (Cadmium): Pls. Double date cosplay.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üò± that'd be a cute photo shoot idea!
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Chris and I plan on doing Ren and Nora... *cough*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): üëÄ
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Anyone wanna be my blake for double date photos
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Leanna let's do beeesss
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YES
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üôåüèª
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): üêù üêù üêù üêù
Anna (Cadmium): I'll make the set and do the location scoping
Jess (whoozica): I need double date so bad
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Let's do it~
Anna (Cadmium): ~~wait I'll make raven and do angry bird mom following her daughter around~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): OMG
Jess (whoozica): Oh poor yang
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~yeets my raven at ya, there ya go!~~
Anna (Cadmium): LEGGO
Anna (Cadmium): Also. Need. Some whiterose with unhappy chaperone winter
Anna (Cadmium): ~~RAVEN AND TAI MEETING BLAKE LIKE A 'SO YOURE DATING OUR DAUGHTER' MEETING~~
Anna (Cadmium): Shovel talk photos
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My dad mentioned about working on fixing up some bird house that broke today and I'm like please no... I don't want you up my butt telling me what I'm doing wrong. I just want a peaceful crafting day üò©
Anna (Cadmium): Mood
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'll do Tai and Anna and I can chaperone
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yes good
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): That's why raven went to tai in the credits scene.... she wanted to tell him that their daughter was going on her first date and that he better come chaperoning
Mark (Mad Doctor): Where would said date occur? Starbucks seems safe, which is why someplace formal with tablecloths and candlelight. Coz I see both Blake and Yang being really uncomfortable in that environment. (Ren would be chill, and Nora wouldn't care about etiquette)
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Ren, in his element, dressed nicely and being a perfect gentleman
Nora, in a fancy dress but scarfing down her food, fuck etiquette
Yang and Blake awkwardly trying to display good manners, deciding the fancy restaurant is too much, and deciding to go get burgers (or fish sandwiches) and milkshakes instead*
Mark (Mad Doctor): *Tai eating leftover food off their plates*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *Nora eats an ungodly amount of food really fast*
Jess (whoozica): She eats at both the fancy place and the borger place
Evie (Katheryne Knight): That is a fucking mood tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): Can I be Pyrrha with a mustache as he waiter
Mark (Mad Doctor): AppleSchnees
Marisa (Mawisa): neon and flynt might put crushed glass in their dish and make a scene to get free stuff. 
flynt might not but i feel like neon would.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _appleschnees_
Mark (Mad Doctor): Busboy Mercury will spit in your food
Georgia (Something Sensible): Y E S
Georgia (Something Sensible): Weiss is the owner
Georgia (Something Sensible): ‚ÄúCan I speak to the manager‚Äù ‚ÄúI AM the manager‚Äù would be the power Weiss move
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh my G O D
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Winter is the lovely assistant to Weiss
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I shall help my sister in any way
Georgia (Something Sensible): Winter is like the accountant, like she makes sure the restaurant is financially sound and operating and peak efficiency
Evie (Katheryne Knight): YEP
Evie (Katheryne Knight): We need a restaurant RWBY AU now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): WE ALL NEED APPLESCHNEES SHIRTS
Matt (mattmyers25): Qrow would be the bartender
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He would drink the whole barb
Evie (Katheryne Knight): *bar

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oscar is the Sous Chef

Tom (tomukuncosplay): s-l300.jpg
Tom (tomukuncosplay): These
Marisa (Mawisa): are u doin shirtless ashitaka or just bein as accurate as possible?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Prob both
Rebecca (madameterralupus): More shirtless sleeves
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol
Marisa (Mawisa): *snow mononoke shoot*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You and Erik can be the shirtless sleeves squad
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Y33T
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Did you mean suffering squad?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): At least yours have a tie to keep them up lol
Marisa (Mawisa): why doesn't he hair armpit hair
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~because armpit hair gross~~
Marisa (Mawisa): tell that to ur armpit
Marisa (Mawisa): and ur hair
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I shave mine
Marisa (Mawisa): look them in the eye
Marisa (Mawisa): as they fall to the ground
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *they're dead*
Marisa (Mawisa): but ashitaka lived like 500+ years ago did guys care about shaving their armpits
Marisa (Mawisa): maybe he's too young. he's like 3.
Marisa (Mawisa): no he's 17
ghibli what is this inaccurate nonsense 0/10
Anna (Cadmium): ~~dont Asian people have like much less hair~~
Marisa (Mawisa): i can't believe erik shaves off his armpits. that's gotta be rough on your shoulders.
Marisa (Mawisa): i noticed a lot of girls who cosplay guys have armpit hair in the changing rooms
Anna (Cadmium): Interesting.
Marisa (Mawisa): i promise i wasn't tryna peep, it's just hard not to see anything when you're literally surrounded by hundreds of people changing. maybe 1/4 of people didn't shave their pits?
there's a ton of shaving products for men, though idk how fast their facial hair grows
Marisa (Mawisa): this is what the changing areas looked like! except this is a makeup area outside of a changing area because i wouldn't ever dare take out my phone in the dressing room. phones were ok here this was a public area where people put on wigs and makeup. that's the same amount of room you get to change in and put on your costume in. i'm so glad this isn't how US cons are run üò≠

Anna (Cadmium): Yikes. 
Kinda glad for US con scene then cause uh. Bathrooms much better than this
Tom (tomukuncosplay): I'll prob trim my armpits before <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> esp if im going tits out
Marisa (Mawisa): you sure have a way with words there
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I just prefer no pit hair because it makes antiperspirant deodorant work better since it actually gets applied to the skin instead of getting smeared in the hair
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah it tru
Marisa (Mawisa): deodorant is good. good. good idea.
Marisa (Mawisa): i'm using wireless headphones while i crunch and when i lean over the fabric just a little too far it disconnects ;u;
