Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~the arda wig i need for gwen is out of stock and wont be back in stock until after katsucon üôÉ~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Might I offer you epiccosplaywigs or fivewitswigs because I too hate ardas obnoxious backorder system
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): do you happen to know off the top of your head if either of those has an undercut wig
Georgia (Something Sensible): Five wits definitely has undercut wigs
Georgia (Something Sensible): In which colors, I do not know
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): YEETING MYSELF OVER THERE
Erik (Red Riot Thot): could this work? http://www.thefivewitswigs.com/shop/wigs/you-know-from-tv/
Erik (Red Riot Thot): the undercut part is hella dark but that seems to be the only thing they have that might work
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it MIGHT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if i cant figure anything else out i might have to go with that one
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~stupid arda christmas sale wiping them out~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): otherwise this might be your excuse to delve into wig splicing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): or just bleach your hair and get the undercut
Erik (Red Riot Thot): xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): after making like 3 separate versions of neos wig, i have an aversion to wig splicing xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): mind as well just SHAVE MY OWN hAIR
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Imagine a cosplay where you *don't* have to wear a wig
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that would be fantastic
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): im tempted now
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It's wonderful
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think it could be a good look for you
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I'm just concerned about bleaching my hair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.> it has so much red in it from past dying so it'll probs just turn out super orange xD ~~FRIcK~~
Jess (whoozica): it would look so cute on you!
but i feel you on the red, my hair was red over a year ago and im still getting the last of the red out
Jess (whoozica): im trying toner shampoo soon to see if that wipes out the rest of it
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): As someone who does it often, not having to wear a wig in cosplay is a GOD SPEND
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): your hair looks so nice now, but yea it took a long time to get all the red tones out omg idk if id even have enough time to get it blonde enough
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ALSO YEA LMAO MEG all i want is to not have to wear a wig, hoooly shit
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Call a hairdresser and ask, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing that much bleach on your own. That‚Äôs how you really fuck up your hair
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ yea hard pass on DIYing
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i'd like to still have hair
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That pun gets you a ‚ú®
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -eyebrow wiggles-
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657>
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Your hair is pretty short so it shouldn‚Äôt be too complicated a process. And besides the shaved side you basically have her cut anyway
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you are not wrong
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i wanted to go blonde anyway .....ü§î
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It‚Äôll also make putting your hair up under a wig THAT much easier
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): DOOOOOOOI
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ITTTTTT
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -starts the new year looking completely different than 2018- "ITS 20BITEEN BITCHES"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): 20BITEEN
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YES
Erik (Red Riot Thot): -gets new haircut- "NEW LOOK WHO DIS"
-plans Spider Gwen cosplay-
-gets new haircut a week later- "NEW LOOK WHO DIS"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Welcome to the life of a cosplayer
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats a mood LMaO
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk if it helps but the comic version has a different haircut if you just wanna be spidergwen and not necessarily Spiderverse spidergwen
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): BUt EDGELORD GWEN THO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fun fact: I tried the undercut slicked back Pidgeotto haircut once
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It was not a good look on me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): @erik YOOF
Georgia (Something Sensible): _pics?_
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I mean, in 2015 I dyed my hair and I told my mom I just wanted to ‚Äútry the color red‚Äù
Georgia (Something Sensible): And u right Leanna edgelord is supreme
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That eyebrow piercing tho
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Is HOT AS FUCK
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ fuck dude, it sure is
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It didn't look horrible at first...
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That doesn‚Äôt look bad tho??????
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): https://media1.tenor.com/images/c7346d56327b922af77ddf51aeed6863/tenor.gif?itemid=5455185
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Lots of business sass with the slicked back hair, glasses and eyebrow
Erik (Red Riot Thot): it was difficult to maintain because it would fall out of place and flop down
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mustache gives me huge Inigo Montoya vibes
Erik (Red Riot Thot): probably wasn't using the right product for it though
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Comic Gwen has the haircut from before miles getting sticky.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That‚Äôs what gel is for
Erik (Red Riot Thot): BUT IT GREW OUT REALLY WEIRD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN IT
Georgia (Something Sensible): But that‚Äôs cash money üí∏üí∏üí∏
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I USUALLY ONLY GOT LIKE TWO HAIRCUTS A YEAR
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also yes the art on the NYCC bags was spidergwen one year and she had this haircut
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): GUYS HAIRCUTE ARE LIKE 20$
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i cosplayed gwenom once a long time ago
Georgia (Something Sensible): _in heaven maybe_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): with that hair
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): That‚Äôs from her spidergwen comic run
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I was trying to grow it out... It was the dawn of the man-bun trend... It was a weird time... I try not to look back on it...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i want edgelord gwen tho
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): She had the blonde bob with the black headband
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): That‚Äôs the classic Gwen look.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I‚Äôm just saying if you‚Äôre desperate because Arda wants to be a TEASE
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I feel you Erik tho, I tried the short bob look in high school. Needless to say it wasn‚Äôt for me
Georgia (Something Sensible): And not a very nice tease
Georgia (Something Sensible): A backorder tease is the worst tease
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): arda needs to order more wigs at once
Erik (Red Riot Thot): This is what it looked like when it wasn't slicked...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theyre like always on backorder
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *weird bob*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): You‚Äôve got the hobo chic look going on
Jess (whoozica): art teacher
Georgia (Something Sensible): ART TEACHER
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): *definitely lives in Portland, OR*
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): music teacher*
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It only got worse
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Plays guitar outside of starbucks on the weekend a
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Art teacher. That‚Äôs totally what j thought.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "anyway heres wonderwall"
Georgia (Something Sensible): ‚ÄúCheck out my soundcloud‚Äù
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ‚ÄúTalk to me when you listen to real music‚Äù
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): ~~punk flody playing in background~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "kombucha is my favorite drink"
Georgia (Something Sensible): The sweater is more art teacher and the T-shirt is music teacher
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like some kinda hippie teacher that does both
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and the plaid cargo shorts that are barely visible are the embarrassing dad
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Why do I feel like you owned like 4 pairs of those
Jess (whoozica): thats such a look ‚Ñ¢
Jess (whoozica): i dig it
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I‚Äôm still stunned by the stashe.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I only had two pairs of plaid shorts. These ones I barely wore because I decided I didn't like them. The others were black with black plaid and they looked good
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Black on black is a classic I‚Äôll give you that one
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I tried doing the facial hair look. It's not a good look on me. I can do the week-old scruff but then it starts looking crusty
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Not crusty just very stonery vibes
Georgia (Something Sensible): So did the man bun ever come to fruition or
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~porn stache~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): BILLIAM NO
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Only managed the samurai top knot
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *Someone had to say it*
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *We‚Äôve all made mistakes in our past, we won‚Äôt judge*
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): SOKKA
Jess (whoozica): im fine with staches as long as there is some beard with it too
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH SOKKA
Erik (Red Riot Thot): my problem with getting haircuts is that I don't know how to ask for what I want so I'll usually bring in a reference picture but it never comes out looking the way I want it... So that why I get my hair cut like twice a year and it's just a styled mess most of the time
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mood
Georgia (Something Sensible): Haircuts are expense so I try to go as little as possible oof
Jess (whoozica): yea cuz everyones hair is little different so it never looks like the pic üò≠
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah and aren't women's cuts like more expensive anyway?
Jess (whoozica): yeet
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have a weird shaped hairline so most hairstyles don't look right
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah thickness plays a role too
Georgia (Something Sensible): A lot of women I know don‚Äôt straighten their hair or it becomes to thin
Georgia (Something Sensible): While most of my family pretty consistently straightens their hair because we all got the thicc hair
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): BIG MOOD GEORGIA
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): when I get my hair done, they have two ppl blow dry it at once and it still takes almost a half hour üòÇ
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Lol I go to my stylist and say "Take a few inches off." And she does and it's like 20 bucks cause it's all I need üòÇ
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hearing everyone say their haircuts are only $20 pains me. I think mine is more than that? Like $35-$40?? <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> ~~I cant recall though cause haven't had a haircut in who knows when lol~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It costs 54$ to get my hair dyed (with the amount of hair I have and compared to others that‚Äôs NOTHING) but when I get it cut and dyed its almost double that üòì ~~another reason why I don‚Äôt cut my hair~~
Jess (whoozica): I don't even know how much it costs for me, Tom and I always go together and he gets foils and get bleach and die, plus hair cuts for both so I'm not sure of exact prices
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Were talking weird hairdos?
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): TIME FOR THE STRAIGHT HAIR DAYS
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ***Y I K E S***
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Super emo boi
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): So like idk how many of your realize 
But I had the supreme hair poof 
And so every time I would get it cut short, wed straighten it to see how long it had gotten
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Like because it becomes a fro you cant tell unless I straighten it 
The longest it's been I was past my shoulders post straightening,
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): But yeah I would go into school with straight hair for like a day or too like that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Walk into class "Whomst the fuck is th--oh shit, it's Hal"
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): The first time I did it was in middle school 
And I went into class and literally nobody recognized me
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): They thought I was a transfer and that I was absent
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Also to get a lowkey idea of my hairs extent, I brushed it post shower with a hair dryer, resulting in Max poof (it was to prove a point with my teacher)
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): 
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Holy shit
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): This isnt even the worse
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Holy fuck
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Yep
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Any advice on how to calm down after an anxiety attack?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): #BringBackTheFro2k19
Halim (Greg) (jake)(Ent): Take deep breaths but focus more on extending your exhale
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Drink water, sounds stupid but it helps regulate your breathing. 

Taking a shower usually helps me too
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): okydoke
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Itz gross and rainy right now but sometimes stepping outside in the cool air helps too
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): üëå
