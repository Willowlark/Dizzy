So many people I work with there don't know how to do half the stuff... it's so frustrating...

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I work 2 places but the one that is V stressful is AC Moore's...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just have to manage until August... lol. Main reasons I am staying until then is cause paid every week and discounts for them crafting supplies XDD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like everyone I work with is nice but most of the time they can't get their stuff together and it drives me nuts >.<
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oh jeez....

Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): Not really a 'support' thing but. I really wish I knew how to process good news better than I do.
Erik/Chuck (Sleiphner): I just got something great at work and all I can do is stoneface it and go "...Thanks."
