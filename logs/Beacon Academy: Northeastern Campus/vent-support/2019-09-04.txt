Mark (Mad Doctor): At vet with my dog right now. Yesterday she went from spry senior citizen to lethargic mass. Vet thinks she has fairly advanced cancer. Awaiting test results
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Sorry to hear Mark ðŸ˜¢
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh no, I'm so sorry Mark ðŸ˜¦
Mark (Mad Doctor): Pup has a twisted liver. Needs surgery which is risky, but she should be ok if she pulls through
Lee & the Bees (Lipstickgiraffe): Oh no I'm sorry to hear she needs surgery, but in the very least it seems like a better diagnosis than late term cancer
