Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ugh I just finished a quotation that we've been working on for like 3 weeks because the customer is incompetent and I finally sent it off and they got back to me asking if we could reduce the lead time (usually 2-3 weeks) and I'm internally screaming because this customer has been so frustrating to work with
Erik (Red Riot Thot): two of the assemblies have a custom cable that we need to buy a 3,200 ft reel of to only use a total of 17 feet so lmao they're paying for the whole reel
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof that's annoying :\
Mark (Mad Doctor): I was talking with two kids in my homeroom about Game of Thrones. One girl asked how long the episodes are. I told her that from here out, episodes would be 80 minutes. "Ugh," she said, "Eighty minutes of wasted time." I wasn't sure how to respond when one of the boys jumped in with "Did you just 'Mean Girls' your history teacher?" 😂
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): wait are they actually gonna be 80 mins
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): because please
Mark (Mad Doctor): Yep
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): -shaking from excitement and also nerves-
Mark (Mad Doctor): Also running a Episode 3 death pool for the faculty. Some characters are waving death flags. I'm sure there will be some surprises, too. If anyone hurts my precious Sam...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if sam dies ill kill everyone and then myself
Mark (Mad Doctor): I think someone in the Brienne-Jamie-Tormund triangle is going to buy it. Much sadness, no matter whom
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): jaime has some major death flags but i will be so upset if he dies
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ....i mean tbh...everyone has death flags and im not ready
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I think at least one of the people on that list will die
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): fun question <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388> 
if you've ever met me irl do you think i'm hard to approach/standoffish/weird in a bad way?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): no
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): not really. I used to think you were more awkward than you actually are and got the impression you were hard to have a conversation with, but after spending a bit of time with you in person i realize thats not true at all. you're great, funny, and easy to talk to
Jess (whoozica): nope! you seemed funny cuz you were making jokes with biru the first time i met you
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): thank u for your very valuable input 💓 
i'll add some new topics to my conversation list, like pomegranate seeds and game controllers with buttons that jam too easily
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: no because i met u at like 1AM at katsu
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: and i assumed i was more awkward than u
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: turns out we both just awkward and must have conversation topic  on hand but then its like convo at 99mph and its amaze
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): if two awkward people sit in awkward silence is it really awkward or does everything cancel out and it becomes normal
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): like if you dig a really big hole you reach china or the ocean
i think it works
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): i think we become super normal cool
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: well we become average bc 2 awkward / 2 ppl = 1 awkward per person
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: what is normal
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): baby don't meme me
don't meme me
no more
doot doo doo doot doo doo doo doo
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): the tension formed by the awkwardness changes its properties from a solid to a gas substance
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: why not plasma
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: its electric
Anna [LOUD BLONDE]: *music noises*
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): boogie oogie woogie
Marisa (お前はもう死んでいる): the plasma is the powerhouse of the cell
