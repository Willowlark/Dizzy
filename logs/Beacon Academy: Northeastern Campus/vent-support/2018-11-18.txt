Marisa (Weeb): ok after 2 more crashes in which i've lost everything, i've learned to save my work while writing an essay. on the upside now I can type 1000 words on this subject in 30 minutes and cite 12 authors by memory.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: oof
you want fucking rwby chibi?: so i full on slammed my knee into a tile floor on wednesday night and i finally went to check How bad that got, and its like. red and yellow and kinda green-ish and definitely a little swollen, so thats fun!
you want fucking rwby chibi?: no idea what to do abt it tho so suggestions wld b appreciated If theres anything i can do besides "just let it heal"
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ouch. Can you put weight on it? Does it hurt worse when you walk? And at the risk of sounding like a gym teacher, you should probably put ice on it
you want fucking rwby chibi?: ive been walking/putting weight on it p fine since wednesday, and i actually had to drive home with it that night so. walking hasnt been a problem as far as i can tell
it doesnt like, hurt much at all any more unless i put pressure on it by touching it directly, but its a nasty bruise for sure
you want fucking rwby chibi?: feels weird it i keep my leg straight but that could just be me being hyperaware of it rn
Mark (Mad Doctor): Well, I'm not that kind of Doctor, but I recommend ice and your painkiller of choice until it gets better. Unless you bang it again, I don't think you can make it worse. Good luck, and I hope you feel better soon
you want fucking rwby chibi?: yea, ill try to put ice on it when i wake up later 👍
ty!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm I say what mark says too. And if it's worse come Monday I'd say may run by your doctor or urgent care to just have them take a look at it to be safe.
Hope it heals up for you soon!! 💕
Rebecca (madameterralupus): >.< I need to remember to start bringing my light reflector to cons lol
