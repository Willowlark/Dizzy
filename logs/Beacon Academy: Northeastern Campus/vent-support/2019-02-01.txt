Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm actually thinking of starting a book. I described the plot to Audrey, and she thought it was cool, so here goes:
It's a heist caper, set in a fictional middle ages during the Black Death. A man travels the countryside recruiting specialists to break into the most secure place imaginable: Hell, as described by Dante. The goal: to free Lucifer and to seek his aid in ending the Plague. They believe that the devil has been maligned by a thousand years of church dogma. What they find defies all their expectations...
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oooooo that does sound cool!
Jamie (Jamie): Oooh sounds intriguing üòØ
