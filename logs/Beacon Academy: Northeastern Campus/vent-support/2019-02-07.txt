Mark (Mad Doctor): Home now. Looking into programs. She's in a much better place. Can't decide if I need to collapse or have a drink so I think I'll fill my tub w scotch and collapse there
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Solid plan 👌
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mark as new Qrow 2k19
Mark (Mad Doctor): BTW the psychologist who saw her at the hospital was a total weeb. She had a Harley Quinn lanyard (ha, ha) and geeked out w Audrey about Jpop and manga
Jess (whoozica): Glad she is feeling better and looking into some programs ♥️
Erik (Red Riot Thot): So we have a big fucking clog in our tub so we can't shower tomorrow 🙃
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Jess (whoozica): Oh no 😱
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Might just go to the gym in the morning and shower there
Jess (whoozica): Ooo there ya go
Georgia (Something Sensible): theres one guy in physics thats awkward but really nice
Jess (whoozica): It's me
Georgia (Something Sensible): and im in the physics lounge like "i want to believe that hes a casanova on tinder or something, like hes secretly super mega popular"
Georgia (Something Sensible): and everyone laughed but now im worried that comes off as kinda jerk-ish _ahhhhHH_
Georgia (Something Sensible): that wasnt an insult, i just thought it was funny to think a shy guy could secretly be super charismatic and sexy on tinder
Georgia (Something Sensible): _but now im overthinking it_
Jess (whoozica): Ooonoooo did he hear you?
Georgia (Something Sensible): nah hes not here
Jess (whoozica): It ok
Georgia (Something Sensible): he might be rooming with noah next year actually
Georgia (Something Sensible): _i still feel bad_
Jess (whoozica): You didn't mean it like that though
ZombieHunter: Today was an adventure
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): What's the haps?
ZombieHunter: I maaaaay have been a troll today and laugh reacted people@defending Vic
ZombieHunter: And then I got this
ZombieHunter: 
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): https://media.tenor.com/images/86eb7c00905ba5fa58b0e0bc7c7c7486/tenor.gif
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Oof
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I probably shouldnt laugh but like LMAO WHAT DUDE WHO JUSTBSEND THAT TO SOMEONE
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Especially Over a fucking VA
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It’s pretty hilarious tbh.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And just.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Also like your clearly not Spanish
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Sad?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): But ok LMAO
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Whose this stupid?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I need to be asleep right now and it’s not working.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Saaaaame
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Same. I got an 8am class .-.
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Chonkin mood
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): My alarm is for 5.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Same bill
Kurtis (Beardedelf94): Oof big same
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I need to get my shower stuff ready to go to the gym to shower in the morning... but I should also be asleep
ZombieHunter: I’m just laughing. Like
ZombieHunter: I’m so confused?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Body: *yawns*
Mind: “let’s think about that one thing from 2 weeks ago and buzz
Body: ***yawns in bold***
Mind: oh and also make a meme on discord can’t forget that.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): How do you guys find motivation to do things. All I did was cut fabric out yesterday and I don't feel like pinning and sewing but I gotta.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Katsucon is less than a week away
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There's your motivation
Erik (Red Riot Thot): lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Caffeine anxiety and blasting studio killers for me
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Or streetlight manifesto
Mark (Mad Doctor): Give yourself permission to take a break.  Clean, watch a movie, go for a walk. Unplug. Then come back later with a fresh perspective
Jess (whoozica): getting started is the hardest thing for me, I start with something small, easy and then that ussually puts me in the mood to continue
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): To do lists. Checking off any one thing in a day is a successful day.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~which reminds me I need to call fireball mountain after lunch~~
Mark (Mad Doctor): To add to what Jess said, I tell my students to break big projects into small, manageable tasks. Focusing on the big goal ("I have to get ready for Katsu") is an easy way to get overwhelmed.
Jess (whoozica): YEA definitely always break it up to smaller tasks. I use lists too, too many lists probably
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *There are never too many lists*
Jess (whoozica): i literally had my katsu to do written, types and on my cosplanner app
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I use apple reminders cause they on phone/macbook, but my todos different than cosplay ones.
Jess (whoozica): i dont like automated reminders for concrunch stuff cuz i feel dread when they pop up
Jess (whoozica): like ill be eating dinner and them its like "go sew the thing" and im like UGH
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Make your list and break it down into super small things so you can check more of them off and feel like you're being more productive
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Oh I don’t use notifications for stuff unless I literally need to do that task at that time.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Like call a place during business hours.
Matt (mattmyers25): I love that my prop is tied up in customs...
Matt (mattmyers25): Not
Georgia (Something Sensible): i am fueled by pure anxiety
Georgia (Something Sensible): its like coffee, but free and tasteless
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I figured out why my forehead keeps breaking out 👿
Anna (loud and likely blonde): My hard hat band hasn't been cleaned in 5ever
Matt (mattmyers25): Is it because of NYC traffic?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I also almost lost a shoe on this damn site
Anna (loud and likely blonde): 
Anna (loud and likely blonde): God damn sucking mud. This is after I cleaned them enough to get in my car
Matt (mattmyers25): How to prepare for an interview
Look presentable
Research company 
Listen to fall out boy in car before going in
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Play Champion by them... why? Cause you gonna be a champion~!
Jess (whoozica): Me great aunt texts me these like really long updates on her life. I don't really even know her and I never know how to answer her most of the time and she always ends them like this:
Jess (whoozica): Like emoji overload plz
Marisa (Mawisa): She’s establishing dominance
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's a lot of emojis... damn...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like it's just such random emojis too xD
Mark (Mad Doctor): There's a whole meal in there. No eggplant, though
Rebecca (madameterralupus): There honestly is XD
Jess (whoozica): Yea like I feel bad cuz she's old and lonely but I'm just like I just don't know how to respond to a whole book
Anna (loud and likely blonde): TODAYS ADVENTURE 
INVOLVED ALMOST BEING RUN OFF THE ROAD BY A SEMI TRUCK CARRYING LEVEL 3 COMBUSTIBLE ITEMS
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
Anna (loud and likely blonde): maybe dont try to merge at 40mph off an exit ramp if you might cause DEATH
Rebecca (madameterralupus): BLESSED BE!! I got all weekend but Thursday off. So I'll just ask Alyssa tomorrow if she can cover it for me since she's off 🙌🏻😩🙏🏻😭
Jess (whoozica): Oh thank god
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was so worried about what'd it look like... ~~I started to have an anxiety attack on the way in~~. Imma too tell her I can cover one of her days in the future if need be if she can cover me
