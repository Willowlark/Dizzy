Rebecca (madameterralupus): Unsure were to put this soo uhh putting here??
Anyone good at computer stuff? Like fixing them? ðŸ¤”
Matt (mattmyers25): What happened?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think I need my laptop's keyboard looked at cause the G and H key are not typing unless I hit them several times/hold it down hard for a while...
It just started doing this the weekend out of nowhere.. O.o
Matt (mattmyers25): The keys could be sticking
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): it's quite likely something is just stuck under there.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm not sure what's up. I just know something with it isn't always registering when I hit them like the others keys... O.o
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That said, removing keys from a laptop never seems to go well.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe I'll pop em off tomorrow and see. Just nervous to do so cause I know someone who did that once and they broke D:
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): If it's a macbook, don't. They're like, designed to break if you remove them.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's bullshit.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Just be very careful if you do it.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol lol. Nahh I own a PC. I can't stand mac's XDD
