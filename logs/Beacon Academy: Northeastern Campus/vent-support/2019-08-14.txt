Jamie (Jamie): so smol dog bit me end of shift yesterday and honestly hurts so much still even typing with that finger hurts a bit. like i don't think ima be useful today if i can't even hold half strength in one of my hands oof
Jamie (Jamie): but need to see how far they gonna go with a raise bribe to keep me working weekends
Jamie (Jamie): they said how much ima tell em 15 and hour or change my schedule cause fuck why not and my hands are more important than this job and would rather find a new one anyway that wont endanger the hands i need for massage
Jamie (Jamie): so not gonna work today because the way my finger is i have a feeling a chance might be infected and im off to urgent care/er to find out yay
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: if a dog bit you at work uhhhhh you also probs need to fill out an accident report
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: and they def have to give you time off to heal
Jamie (Jamie): It happened yesterday end of shift. Called off today so i can jave the doc look at it and going in later to fill out paperwork they deemed yesterday not to have me fill out
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: did anyone see it happen/see you right after it happened? youll need to get them to probs sign saying they witnessed
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: i had to do this a couple times ~~one when i fell off a curb directing traffic~~
Jamie (Jamie): Yea in fact my store manager and salon leader were both witness to what happened (and sort of reason I was even trying to get near the dog still after initial instinct said no this bad dog danger danger when it growled to my hands mere presence)
Jamie (Jamie): They wanted me to try a different method to see if the dog would be calmer away from the parent and kinda worked til needed to put lead on still cause policy and it went fuck you in front of all who were there
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: fucking incredible. 
well at least there was witness and probs store cameras.
Jamie (Jamie): Update: got x ray done waiting for results of that to make sure nothing got broke
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: also ok good that you know who it was and can have them vouch it happened. Heres hoping its just something that can be fixed with like. cream or antibiotics
Jamie (Jamie): Oh there is def a camera in wherei was that got front row view of the action
Jamie (Jamie): Yea hopefully i dont think it got bone if it did maybe scratched it? But they said antibiotics gonna be the thing we go with. Watching for names of what they give tho since i know one exists now that is like fucking vicodin and knocks me out after taking
Jamie (Jamie): *but drowsy isnt it side affect officially* but online has so many people having that same reaction to it
