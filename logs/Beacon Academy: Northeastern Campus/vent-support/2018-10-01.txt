Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~change seats~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): â€¦class already started or I would

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): don't let your dreams be dreams. just stand up, do the chicken dance, and then sit down in a new seat in the middle of lecture

ZombieHunter: <@288513265661902858>
ZombieHunter: Kato is weird as fuck
ZombieHunter: Heâ€™s an issue in Caseyâ€™s server. Iâ€™m gonna talk to jake
ZombieHunter: Okay so Iâ€™m catching up. Kato Drakstar is on the spectrum. He messaged someone how he wanted her as his phone background and asks for IG story original photos (no text messages over it)
ZombieHunter: If you guys have issues with him, if youâ€™re in the LMvosplays server, itâ€™s likely how he found you
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I figured. 
Heâ€™s just more annoying to me
ZombieHunter: If you have any problems, let us know. Weâ€™ve talked to him before and can do it again
ZombieHunter: <@!229713389511901185>  <@!245270932602486784>  <@288513265661902858>  permission to share to Caseyâ€™s mod/Admin team?
ZombieHunter: 
ZombieHunter: Itâ€™s just to keep an eye on his behavior. Like I said Iâ€™m asking first on it before doing anything.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Sure go ahead. 
I just feel bad because like...I donâ€™t want to think like that, and I know why they are the way they are but my personality doesnâ€™t mix well with theirs.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And itâ€™s like that with some people I know. Like that person I basically forced myself to hang out with the other weekend. I donâ€™t hate him, but my personality doesnâ€™t mix well with his.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Some older woman sat down in another seat of the train. She stood up, turned around, and sat in the seat next to me.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Iâ€™m... concerned?
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): HOW DARE
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Is this how I die?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Context, train is EMPTY right now.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Get up and move seats?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nah, Iâ€™m on the inside and itâ€™s a three seat wide seat.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m bothered by her sitting there. Someone would have before the train departed.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Itâ€™s just weird how she seemed to decide to sit near me... specifically.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Maybe she was lonely?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Hasnâ€™t talked to me, is reading her paper, and I have big headphones on.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Like? I doubt I look chatty. Certainly less so than the few others here.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Itâ€™s weird man.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Lmao
