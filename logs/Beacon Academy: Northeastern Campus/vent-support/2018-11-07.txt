Rebecca (madameterralupus): I 👏  hate 👏  writing 👏  essays 👏 😩
Mark (Mad Doctor): I hate grading them...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂 let's work together mark to erase the existence of them then since I *a student* hate them and you *a teacher* hate them LOL
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm for moving to alternative systems of grading, like shameless bribes of baked goods
Halim (Greg): Essays are like one part of education that is actually like
Halim (Greg): Really important tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): As a bench science and humanities major, can confirm, important for both
Georgia (Something Sensible): Some essays are bullshit but you gotta convey yourself well in any field
Mark (Mad Doctor): I hate grading them, but, yeah, they're important. As I tell my students: for the rest of your life, idiots you don't know will judge you by your ability to express yourself with the written word.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): As someone with a masters degree in computer science, essays are dumb and wastes of time.
Georgia (Something Sensible): _you have to convey yourself thoooo_

Jess (whoozica): ye technically i could take luch but then ill have to stay till 5:30 and i dont wanna do that XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My boss just said we're getting a 3D printer. Part of me is super stoked but another part of me knows we're probably never actually going to get it. In my 2 years here, there have been so many gadgets and shit that my bosses have been saying they planned on getting but never once have we gotten any of them. Like they were planning to get a robot arm to try to automate stuff in the shop. Never happened. I even designed and had something fabricated to attach to it that is now just sitting. Then they wanted a laser cutter/stripper/marker to make processing wires easier. The sales rep that visited us basically had everything ready to go for us to buy it and then they just ignored him and dropped the idea.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There's probably some other things I'm missing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The only gadget we ever actually bought was an XRF gun but that was because we had an issue with lead contamination and *needed* something asap to be able to check to make sure our stuff was lead free
