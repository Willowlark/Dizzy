Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): holy fuck

Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: I get paid for those 30 but still like. 
Glad I got my RTX stuff done mostly
Jamie (Jamie): So already clawing for a job of higher pay (therefore worth the switch) because tonight is to be my first shift at wawa and i'm already hating it but i need the fucking money and ugh more annoyance when think of how I havr almost 3 weeks before i get to see any of the money cause fuck timing apparently??
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: listen its easier to find a job when you have a job
Anna [Robo Hands 5ever]: stick with wawas while youre hunting bc even if u dont get money for 3 weeks youll actually get that money and shifts
