Jamie (Jamie): Wow so I was put on a stronger anti biotic called Clindamycin and it doesnt list drowsiness as a side effect but yet I feel dead tired after taking it. Looking it up I found alot of people end up the same yet it literally never says it's a side effect. People who write the side effects really need to notice people complaining about this obvious side effect.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I'm breathing in the steam from my lunch and it feels really good on my nasal passages, plus it smells good too
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Erik let me direct you to my stuffed nose and sore throat savior

Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~the universe might implode if yall worked at the same company~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Eh. It survived Ashley joining them.

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Meanwhile I had a conversation with my boss about the validity of my skill set in the overall market, sparked by my bumbling around linkedin yesterday, without telling him why I was thinking about the holes in my skill set and oddity of the niche I fill.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I'm in a really weird role here. It's not a bad role, quite nice, but. If I were to leave I dunno if I'd fill either the full stack side or the data science sides. I'm just... the bridge, between those groups.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): goodbye mars rover
Mark (Mad Doctor): Took Audrey to the pediatrician today for a follow-up appointment. Realized I was in a gigantic petri dish filled with disease. Currently bathing in purel
Mark (Mad Doctor): 1) Found out that my wife's toxic boss of the past three years gave her two weeks notice to return to Texas
2) Decided to surprise wife with dinner if carnitas and margaritas
3) Accidentally poured rendered pork fat over the back of my hand while I was dealing fat from the meat
4) Mothafucka! Are those blisters?
5) At least I won't be wearing heavy gauntlets any time in the foreseeable future...crap
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Now you are the hound
Mark (Mad Doctor): My brother wonders why I try to beat the snot out of him each time I see him
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yikes that sounds painful ðŸ˜± and return to Texas?? ðŸ˜®
