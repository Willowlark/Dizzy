Marisa (Weeb): speaking of students
i have a girl i occasionally tutor, volunteer thing because her mom and i go to the same conversation group sometimes and she wants her daughter to learn english and I can use the girl for my homework assignments so it's win-win
they're chinese, the girl is learning english, our common language is japanese which we're all far from fluent in.
how do I explain the difference between "the" and "a" when I say it in my limited Japanese and the mother has to translate it into Chinese but the girl doesn't understand and it gets lost in google translate  <:imdyingsquirtle:378261448838610944> 
for now i'm just like "you'll get it in time so keep practicing" but i can tell she's frustrated
Georgia (Something Sensible): The is a particular thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): A is a general thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like "I want a donut" implies there's already no donut in existence around you now
Georgia (Something Sensible): Versus "I want the donut" implies that you can indicate, nearby, a particular donut
Georgia (Something Sensible): I had the same problem learning french
Georgia (Something Sensible): In french you say "I like donuts" but it's verbatim would be "I like the donut"
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk how that translates to Japanese but good luckkkk maybe I helped idk
Marisa (Weeb): yeah thank ye ^u^
i know how to explain it because the question pops up like 10 times a day at work, but my students normally understand when I explain it in english (they usually ask something like "what's the difference between *a* cafe and *the* cafe?")
but in japanese (and I guess chinese?) they don't have anything like that. they don't even use plurals most of the time 🤷
the girl doesn't understand the english explanation so i try it in japanese and her mother translates that into chinese
maybe the girl is just overworked because students here have too many responsibilities 😱
Marisa (Weeb): actually. japanese does have a thing like that. 🤔 
***i can use that*** she should understand it. a breakthrough.
Marisa (Weeb): カフェはどこ？
カフェがどこ？
maybe she'll get it if i compare those to english
Georgia (Something Sensible): do they have the word "that"?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): これ、それ、あれ。This (near me), that (by you), and that (over there).
Mak (hollyjollymak): Mmmmmmmmmmm we’re having a fun day with suite mates where I just got a note under my door claiming I had left two discarded band-aids on the bathroom floor when I haven’t even *opened my first-aid kit since I got to my dorm*
Jess (whoozica): Lol wtf
Mak (hollyjollymak): I handled it politely and fairly because I’m an RA but I’m also a petty hoe who knows that she did nothing wrong
Georgia (Something Sensible): you get notes about this?
Georgia (Something Sensible): someone threw up in the sink at rutgers and everyone just shrugged
Mark (Mad Doctor): First day back for teachers today. One hour of our time was taken up with new active shooter protocols. Interestingly, the cops who ran it said that one of the most proactive things we can do is encourage our older students to vote...
