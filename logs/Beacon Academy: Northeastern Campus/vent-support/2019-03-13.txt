Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Hello way late but I heard talk about ~~finding lovings~~ ?
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: Don't give up on finding somebody, if you're specifically looking for something thats gonna be _really_ more its gonna be harder to find, but that means things are worthwhile.
Also don't worry about hunting them down, if you're open  to meeting new people and you want a relationship you'll be able to find somebody eventually.
