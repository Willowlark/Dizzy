Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am one year from *hopefully* graduating college... Why do I suddenly want to change my major again ðŸ˜«
Mark (Mad Doctor): As long as you're not totally starting from scratch, not a terrible decision. A former student (and cosplayer) just graduated after she switched her major from East Asian Studies to Astrophysics
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd still be a Comm major but I did a "what If degree audit" and sadly I'd be going longer cause I've only taken 1 of the main major classes... ðŸ˜­ guess I'm stuck.
