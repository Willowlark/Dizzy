Marisa (Weeb): homestuck was open in one of my browser tabs when i woke my computer up and i don't know why, nor do i remember going on it last night
Erik (slendergiant): So took my car in to get the tire looked at today. There was a nail in my tire but it didn't puncture and they couldn't find any sources of leaking but they did some maintenance on it just to be safe. I hope that helped because I filled it up to 32psi on Friday and yesterday it was back down to 20 soooo... we'll see ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mark (Mad Doctor): Clearly someone has been stealing your air...
Erik (slendergiant):
