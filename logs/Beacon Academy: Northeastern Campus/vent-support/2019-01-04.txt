Evie (Katheryne Knight): Did anyone else have the BNE chat disappear because of some form out outage?
Marisa (Mawisa): not bne but another server disappeared and i couldn't figure out which it was oops
Erik (Red Riot Thot): No... ðŸ‘€
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This happens to discord occasionally.
Marisa (Mawisa): I just went deaf due to the amount of screeching that occurred when Sakura Kiss came on, and then one girl bowed so hard during Study Equals Magic that it caused a domino effect of falling cosplayers

But also two people without partners spotted each other at the same time during a partner dance section of the song and the one girl just FLEW across the room and slid into a proposal pose at the perfect moment. I want to remember that coolness forever.
Marisa (Mawisa): There are so many girls making heart hands at the hitachiin twins I canâ€™t see the screen lol

Jess (whoozica): So like a week ago my boss fired my favorite coworker and only work friend and is hiring an advertising agency to fill his space but the as agency also does graphics obviously so basically now what going to happen is the ad agency is going to create the sytle for everything and then im just going to "copy" them to other things (i.e. doesnt wanna pay them to do everything when i work for cheaper) because my boss doesn't value my opinions at all and only cares what the ad agency guy says because my boss wont listen to women and only listens to 60+ year old men, which he will say is based on "their experience" meanwhile, he wants me to "keep a positive attitude" and "needs my commitment"
Marisa (Mawisa): become a 60 year old man
Marisa (Mawisa): that'll show him
