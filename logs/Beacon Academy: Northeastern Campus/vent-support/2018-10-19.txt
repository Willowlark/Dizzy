Jess (whoozica): Georgia you can come clean my bathroom anytime, as loud as you want üòÇ
Evie (Katheryne Knight): GOD FORBID YOU BE A GOOD ROOMMATE AND CLEAN THE BATHROOM

Like damn I wish my suite mate in Florida did that ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Marisa (Weeb): maybe she's being *extremely* tsundere and trying to convey she doesn't want you to dirty your hands by cleaning the bathroom. <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): One part of me: Picked up more work hours tomorrow in the morning cause class was cancelled, have the free time and need monies...
Other part of me: Whyyy did you do that?? You could have slept in, did chores, relaxed most of all
Georgia (Something Sensible): Monies pays for cosplay at least!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Indeed! And cons. Which is ANYC is happening imma deff need some extra monies the next coming weeks to go lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): It seems that Sarah is sleeping here once again tonight üòë it‚Äôs 10:26 and she hasn‚Äôt left, and her bedtime is usually 10:30
Georgia (Something Sensible): That week where she didn‚Äôt sleep here was the best time sigh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just slowly start moving all her shit out as she sleeps. Then toss her out too lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): She‚Äôs talking to my other suitemate Kiera right now (the one who gave me the peen) about how ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to feel vulnerable‚Äù
Georgia (Something Sensible): OMG MOOD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Then when all is moved and she's like how'd I get here you can be like, I heard you were moving out... so I helped you do it sooner XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): Oh now Kiera‚Äôs telling her the ‚Äúimportance of respecting others‚Äù
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah!! Look at me, so friendly
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao did Sarah react to the lil peen at all? I know you mentioned she was kinda iffy on stuff like that yea?
Georgia (Something Sensible): OH IDK I hope she did
Georgia (Something Sensible): Lil peen is a beautiful boy
Erik (slendergiant): <@327835140216586242> <@245270932602486784>
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): GOD BLESS
Marisa (Weeb): ~~maybe pyrrha's pajamas suck because she stole a pair of jaune's pajamas~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMFAO
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Post that everywhere and @ roosterteeth
Jess (whoozica): üôå
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yes please üëå
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sarah talking to Kiera: "I just can't go to sleep some nights because I know Georgia will come back late and wake me up"
Georgia (Something Sensible): _yall i cant win, i leave to study elsewhere so she can sleep and she hates me_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Dis bish...
Georgia (Something Sensible): which, confirmed, btw, kiera said sarah does hate me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): WOOWWW wtf?!
Tom (tomukuncosplay): <:pewish:420824457918152704> ‚úå
Erik (slendergiant): You're roommate is an actual cunt
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd 100% stop accommodating to her now. Espec after that comment and since she's moving out soon.
Erik (slendergiant): *Give her a real reason to hate you before she goes*
Jess (whoozica): I can't sleep cuz I know shell wake me up so I'll lose more sleep waiting for her instead of just getting sleep before she gets home, waking up for five mins and falling back to sleeo
Georgia (Something Sensible): kiera said she was getting cold feet about moving out too!!
Georgia (Something Sensible): like sarahs been sleeping at home the last week and everyones been happier
Erik (slendergiant): *GIVE HER A REAL REASON TO MOVE OUT*
Georgia (Something Sensible): _what can i do for a real reason_
Georgia (Something Sensible): like frankly if shes gonna have the bedtime of a ten year old, she should be sleeping at home anyways
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like idk about you ~~(cause you're such a nice person I feel you have no bad/evil side lol)~~ but if were me I would straight up just start being an ass back to this bitch until she moves out... Like what the hell?? What reason does she have to hate you? You have done nothing to her. You have changed everything you do normal to make her living better and she still finds a reason to complain
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I would stop completely doing what she has asked. Like live your life how you do. It's your room too so you do you as if at home/she's not there. She complains tough shit. Nice nice time is over
Erik (slendergiant): Pretend she already moved out and ignore her existence. Live your dorm life the way you want to
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Agreed with Erik
Georgia (Something Sensible): ü§î
Georgia (Something Sensible): the only caveat is that i dont wanna get on the others bad sides
Georgia (Something Sensible): tho i just cleaned the bathroom so idk that puts me in everyones good graces lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am sure you won't. They know the issues yea? And you don't share a room with them soo
Georgia (Something Sensible): like i try to see what i did wrong but literally i moved around my whole life for sarah and she still bitches about me
Georgia (Something Sensible): and doesnt even have the guts to bitch to my face
Erik (slendergiant): Voluntarily cleaning the bathroom or washing the dishes automatically makes you the superior suitemate
Georgia (Something Sensible): mood
Marisa (Weeb): do the others know she didn't like you cleaning
Georgia (Something Sensible): but yeah like i change my study habits and dont have friends over as late as i like and NEVER have boys over cause of this bitch
Georgia (Something Sensible): and she still has the audacity to hate me
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i told kiera
Georgia (Something Sensible): she was like "ok well THATS weird"
Georgia (Something Sensible): literally the week where sarah slept at home was heaven
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If she doesn't move out are you stuck with her next for Spring semester too?? ~~I've never dormed so idk how that ish works lol~~
And mhmm. She seems to just want to find a reason to complain. Or even more so... there is no pleasing her. She's not gonna change... She'll just keep being this way if not get worse. 
And yes if you clean you're automatically a excellent roommate lol. They'll love you cause you saved them from doing it. <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah if she doesnt leave, im stuck with her for the spring semester it sucks
Marisa (Weeb): watch her move into another dorm and find out how much worse other people are as roommates
Georgia (Something Sensible): ^^^^^
Erik (slendergiant): She would die
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Okay that's what I thought most school dorms were like, same roomies both semesters but you mentioned once before for the rest of the semester so  I didn't know if you'd be free of her that semester/if it was diff at your school lol. 
And LMAO Marisa
Georgia (Something Sensible): my friend noah have to intervene with his roommate cause his roommate hasnt been sober longer than 24 hours in the last two weeks
Georgia (Something Sensible): like i could be SO much worse
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Dammnnnn
Georgia (Something Sensible): my other friend has a roommate that doesnt shower
Georgia (Something Sensible): period.
Georgia (Something Sensible): like????
Georgia (Something Sensible): i could be the WORST
Rebecca (madameterralupus): .... I...
Georgia (Something Sensible): also theres technically no rules saying that sarah has any authority of how our living room is used
Georgia (Something Sensible): so having rules for friends coming over is me doing a courtesy to her
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm indeed. She seems very controlling....? Like she is the leader of the dorm.. when really no one is... Like da fuq is up with this girl
Georgia (Something Sensible): idk
Georgia (Something Sensible): shes really coddled at home probably
Georgia (Something Sensible): she makes me so mad!
Georgia (Something Sensible): like thank god i have friends in this building that let me study in their room üò≠
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Possibly, and she may be taking that coddling/rules at home and applying them there where they shouldn't be... like break loose some girrrll. And mhmmm that's good at least.
Georgia (Something Sensible): its weird cause she wants the rules of home (10:30 bedtime, no friends, no boys) without being home
Georgia (Something Sensible): kiera said that sarah said shes "happier at home but comfier at school"
Georgia (Something Sensible): kiera was like "she shouldnt have to move out to be happy"
Georgia (Something Sensible): and i was like "she should have to compromise then"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm agreed.
Georgia (Something Sensible): like yall if you see "local NJ college student has a mental breakdown and murders roommate"
Georgia (Something Sensible): like... it might be me
Georgia (Something Sensible): i hate her so much üò≠
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I don't blame you for hating her. She's been pretty damn shitty to you for stupid reasons. I'd hate her too...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And like also da fuq... How can she hate you?? You are such a nice and fun person <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Jess (whoozica): This girl seriously doesn't know what a bad roommate is
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Georgia isn't the bad roommate... she is..
Georgia (Something Sensible): my roommate last year actively made fun of my friends like lol wut
Georgia (Something Sensible): i could be so much more of a jerk
Rebecca (madameterralupus): O.o wtf??
Georgia (Something Sensible): and i told sarah that i was going through a lot at the beginning of september too and asked if she cared and she was like "no"
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): but being the conceited bitch that she is, she won't ever realize that she's the problem
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I read that wrong so I delere my comment XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh man yall are right, im not gonna change my lifestyle for her anymore
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa that's pretty shitty. Like way to care??
And mhmm yes. Just live your life as you would, don't let her control shit anymore.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I hate confrontation and avoid it at all costs but when someone is trying to control every aspect of your life for such petty reasons it isn't worth trying to compromise anymore
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm agreed. I don't like confrontation either but when someone is being shitty and making me feel terrible, someone I know feel terrible or doing something wrong I will speak up about it to stop it. And hope they learn from it ~~doubtful though~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just slightly regret saying I could work this morning cause oof I slept like shit last night so highkey dragging from lack of sleep üò´
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Why did I agree to make 3 treats for my neices bday.... nothing is working as planned cause half the ingredients my mom got are wrong üò´
Casey (Raining_Jellyfish): this is sketchy right?
Jess (whoozica): yea def
Erik (slendergiant): Yup
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Da fuq...?
Tom (tomukuncosplay): But but... Is he love you?
