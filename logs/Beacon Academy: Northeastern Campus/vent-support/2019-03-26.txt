Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have a literature review due tomorrow for my class but holy shit... I can't focus at all to work on it T_T
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ’¢ So the motherfucker who asked me on a date and then made me look like a fool when he was like nah I dont want a relationship just dm's me out of nowhere asking me if I've been to Colossalcon... Like... I left you on read days ago for a reason dude. I don't want to talk to you. Sure I can simply answer him but again... I just really don't wanna fucking talk to him... He's acting as if he didn't just be an asshole to me leading me on pretty much. Like oh yeaa nothings happen... wtf... >>
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Block that bitch
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Honestly just might.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I really feel like I was made a fool. I mean... Im sorry but like when ya say "I want to take you on a date sometime"... What the hell else am I supposed to take it as? Date to me means I am interested in getting to know you for a potential relationship. Either he just worded it as that thinking he could get some ass... or was not interested ~~which like if that's the case I'd rather ya be honest.~~
But like mega yikes. He deff has become an asshole since I graduated >.>

Evie (Katheryne Knight): B l o c k

Mark (Mad Doctor): Welp, at least three students who don't follow me have liked my God of Light photo, which means the entire student body has likely seen it. Will not be surprised to see my shiny gold ass all over school next week ðŸ¤£
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Teacher goals.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~listen at my high school we had a teacher that was in an XXX film so like. shiny gold ass is probs better.~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): > boss: What else do you have to work on?
> me: *~points to white board with 16 projects~* Aaaaaall that...
> boss: "Great, man, I love it!"
Erik (Red Riot Thot): > me (internally): *I fucking don't...*
