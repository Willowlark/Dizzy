It's felt like the week has dragged on D:
ZombieHunter: Why
ZombieHunter: Why are people so weird on IG
ZombieHunter: like I think someone legit unfollowed Casey (not mangoloo. Other Casey) for holding a cigarette in a photo shoot
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao wow
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I have referred to them as the 'unintelligent masses' once already today.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Fame is overrated.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): as is follower counts and then things that come with it.
ZombieHunter: it was a life is strange shoot
ZombieHunter: people who have to announce their dislike and opinion are either idiots or reaaaaaaaally like attention....
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof thatâ€™s too true...
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeee
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I highly dislike people that do that. Like...okay edge lords calm down. Youâ€™re not any cooler because you voice your high dislike for something 

Like itâ€™s okay to dislike something or somebody but people who parade it around all the damn time need to calm down.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I remember joining a live stream of Washington after the election. Hundreds of people writing paragraphs of their opinions and thoughts and hate for the other side. Meanwhile, a thousand comments got posted and the conversation is lost.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): And not a single person read anyone else opinions.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It was hilarious.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): My favorite part was how much they sounded like meme posts, but they were being serious.
Erik (slendergiant): I just saw it. It sucks that their uncle died of lung cancer, but like... that's not relevant to the post...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): lmao i just saw it too, thats so rude
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): why feel the need to comment. like bro, just unfollow silently
Jess (whoozica): seriously wtf
Jess (whoozica): like fr? its not even lit? like???
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I donâ€™t understand people sometimes. If itâ€™s that much of an issue, silently unfollow. Itâ€™s not that hard.
Georgia (Something Sensible): LOL WUT I JUST SAW IT
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Some people have no filter when it comes to to typing/saying what they think. It's like they think it, don't even process it, just let it out. Like okay ummm
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Seriously
Rebecca (madameterralupus): > gets on Facebook to see what's new while on break at work 
> sees family arguing politics and religion...
> welp so much for that nice relaxing social media check up ðŸ™ƒ
Matt (mattmyers25): So my basement at work where my desk is may have mold. One girl may of gotten sick from it and I always feel like crap when I work down there
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yikes...is there a way to get it fixed at all or wonâ€™t they do anything about it?
Matt (mattmyers25): Probably wont do anything about it because they are cheap
Matt (mattmyers25): But yet we have 10 boxes full of wine in the room next door
