Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Did you keep the tickets? Don‚Äôt they give you some form of receipt?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've only ever gotten a receipt once. No one gives them, ya gotta ask. And no they take the tickets. But like mentioned dad read it was a toll booth free road but ya gotta pay sooo?? O.o Idk and at the moment just dont care anymore D:
Anna (Cadmium): I have to give this fat cat insulin twice a day for the rest of his life. 
I live with people but essentially alone bc we really all just split rent. 
I'm 22 and the pet I got for companionship so I wouldn't be alone is whats gonna keep me more alone than before 
Fuck.
Anna (Cadmium): I know that sounds mean I'm just. Upset.
Anna (Cadmium): üòû
Jess (whoozica): Awww üòî I'm so sorry! That suck for you and kitty
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean he still gon love you
Anna (Cadmium): Yeah I just can barely travel now unless I get someone to watch him or I find a pet friendly air bnb. Cause pet boarding places don't usually do injections so that's out.
Anna (Cadmium): ~~guess I'm cutting alchohol out of my life to afford this~~
Anna (Cadmium): Gonna play some FO4 to raise my spirits
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Oof.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Maybe you can talk to the shelter and ask why they didn‚Äôt tell you this?
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~Actually if they told people it‚Äôd kill the poor guys chances of adoption~~
Jess (whoozica): Cats aren't nessecarily born with diabetes they can develop it my can developed it at like 12 yrs old
Anna (Cadmium): Yeah but I adopted him at 8yrs old. Like. I've only had him since November and I highly doubt he developed it in the two months I've had him in
Anna (Cadmium): He also had an already existing gum disease that they pointed out to me like. What did this shelter actually check for
Matt (mattmyers25): Time for my interview. Wish me luck
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): GOOD LUCK!!! YOULL DO GREAT

Georgia (Something Sensible): this is my cold cut, no editing, kind of "landing page" description
Georgia (Something Sensible): thoughts???
Anna (Cadmium): no exclamation marks
Marisa (Mawisa): Needs at least 8 more colors and an animated cursor
Anna (Cadmium): but the animated cursor needs to be a can of refried beans
Marisa (Mawisa): deep fried
Georgia (Something Sensible): /abuses exclamation points because i am eternally both excited and filled with enthusiasm
Georgia (Something Sensible): thank
Anna (Cadmium): idk i was always insulted by ! in textbooks so maybe its just me
Anna (Cadmium): like no i really dont give a flying fuck about open channel flow and weirs
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Jess (whoozica): lol i use exclamation points all the time. but for this purpose i can see why you wont want too
Georgia (Something Sensible): _do i get rid of the last one too, cause adding a period just feels passive aggressive_
Georgia (Something Sensible): like
Georgia (Something Sensible): Enjoy.
Georgia (Something Sensible): No thats what the waiter says after he spits in your food
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Less is more I find in descriptions. Especially if you have nothing specific to describe.
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i figure three sentences makes sense
Georgia (Something Sensible): who am i, what am i posting, and for what purpose
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me: georgia, posting: physics, for: everyone
Anna (Cadmium): Georgia: online
Space: out
Forcibly removed from the Ruby Tuesdays
Georgia (Something Sensible): if someone had to write a review of me as a human being that sounds painfully accurate
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ‚ÄúPhysics blog of Georgia L Sandidge‚Äù
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Additional adjectives as required.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ‚ÄúHuman readable physics blog of Georgia L Sandidge‚Äù
Georgia (Something Sensible): im hesitant about popping in my last name if only cause im very cautious of interwebs stalkers
Anna (Cadmium): nah dont put your last name
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```Henlo friendos! My name is Georgia, and I am currently a junior-year P H Y S I C S student at Rutgers University! Here, you‚Äôll be able to see some super rad articles pertaining to the neato physics concepts I‚Äôve explored, literature I‚Äôve read, work I‚Äôve performed, and much much more! It is my hope that this blog appeals to all those with an interest in physics and space shit at all levels, from professional physicist-senpais to the everyday weeb and normie with an interest in how our universe works. Yeet!```
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fixed it
Georgia (Something Sensible): _wheres the emojis erik you fool_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~wheres the pyrrha scream~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): üëæ <:green_alien:378261531214872576> üòè <:pewish:420824457918152704>
Georgia (Something Sensible): perfect
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Justified concern. One day you need to be able to do that though, when you publish papers.
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh yeah
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats different
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): But yeah. Short and simple.
Georgia (Something Sensible): ill buy georgiasandidge.com when i have to do the whole cv thing
Georgia (Something Sensible): but this is just physics for funsies
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Georgia Instagram-famous wezrez Sandidge*
Georgia (Something Sensible): /puts that as my name, inviting the creepos from instagram to stalk me to their hearts content
Georgia (Something Sensible): really tho, one cosplayer was stalked so much that her car got set on fire at ALA this past weeked
Georgia (Something Sensible): that stuff creeps me the fuck out, its why i dont post my college or last name on instagra
Anna (Cadmium): OwO Hewwo fwiend! My name is Georgia (nyah), and I am currently a junior-year P H Y S I C S student at Rutgers University!!!! Here, you‚Äôll be able to see some SUPER rad articles pertaining to the super kawaii neato physics concepts I‚Äôve explored, literature I‚Äôve read, work I‚Äôve performed, and much much more! It is my hope that this blog appeals to all those with an interest in physics and space shit at all levels, from professional physicist-senpais to the everyday weeb and normie with an interest in how our universe works. Yeet!
Anna (Cadmium): i tweaked it
Georgia (Something Sensible): its beautiful
Anna (Cadmium): yeahhhhhhh i only tell ppl my college cause im out
Georgia (Something Sensible): that belongs in a museum
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah id prob tell people after i graduate
Georgia (Something Sensible): but then i cant tell people my _grad_ school
Anna (Cadmium): better to just tell ppl what youre studying and leave it at that
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): ~~fame is a bad thing~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I really need to solidify that phrase, I don‚Äôt say it consistently.
Jess (whoozica): she wasnt even like super famous tho
Jess (whoozica): like less then half the followers georgia has
Jess (whoozica): i feel so bad for her üò≠
Georgia (Something Sensible): like this is obviously exaggerated but what if someone with a weird pyrrha fixation stalks me
Georgia (Something Sensible): _pyrrhas dead yall what does that mean for me_
Jess (whoozica): ahhh no dont say that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh so speaking of not posting your last name (or people who don't use their real name) on Instagram... Definitely watch out with who you accept friend invites with from Facebook (and DEFINITELY tighten your security settings) because ever since I started accepting more friends from the cosplay community, other people often pop up on my "People You May Know" so it's not incredibly difficult for creeps to find you on Facebook
Erik (Red Riot Thot): All it takes is finding a few people
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Who know a few people
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Who know a few more people
Anna (Cadmium): not even that just one
Anna (Cadmium): added hunter; literally my suggested filled with people that are 1 friend in common
Erik (Red Riot Thot): oh yeah I get that too
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yep I've run into that problem
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee my security settings are super tight on fb. And I don't accept just anyone. I'll only accept you if I hung out with you a good bit at a con and have gotten to know you better.  I recently had to fix my facebook settings and stuff cause I had some people I only met at a con once and barely even talked to adding me.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): If you have one friend in common I don't accept
Anna (Cadmium): it must cross with events youre interested in
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i have had like 8 separate people who i do not know at all try to add me the past couple weeks
Jess (whoozica): yeaaa i tightened mine a little while ago but ii should prob double chack
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i dont accept anyone if i havent met them at least once
Georgia (Something Sensible): yeah i only add people ive talked to
Anna (Cadmium): should probs purge
Anna (Cadmium): tbh
Georgia (Something Sensible): i wonder if i should change my last name to my middle name JUST in case
Georgia (Something Sensible): ive been toying with that idea
Anna (Cadmium): im debating taking my last name off but my middle name on Fb isnt even my middle name
Erik (Red Riot Thot): time to purge the last remaining people from high school that I don't give two shits about
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i would, since your followers are climbing on insta
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like fb suggests me people I follow on insta to add as friends but I don't know them that well to add them my personal facebook... Sure it be cool to be friends with them someday maybe but like... ??
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Fun fact, I changed my name too many times on Facebook that I can't change it anymore except to one of the names I previously changed it to
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): omg lol
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I've been getting creeps from like out of nowhere like WHOMST THE FUCKETH
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): same
Jess (whoozica): yea it doesnt let you change it alot
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Pretty sure I did that same thing when I was younger. I added dumb things in my name XD ~~fuck me if I ever get married, probs wont be able to change it lol~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): My biggest issue is this person I took a pic with once last year at katsu, we took 1 pic, chatted for maybe 3 mins... and she added me on fb?? How did you find me??
Anna (Cadmium): ugh i need to go purge every fuckin frat guy from college that i added to meet quota
Georgia (Something Sensible): _why the fuck do i have 200 friends_
Anna (Cadmium): ~~i ended up on reddit from NYCC and had my FB tagged RIP~~
Anna (Cadmium): 200????
Anna (Cadmium): bro i got 770 how did i get here
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I every once in a blue moon purge my friends list. Should probs do it again soon but eh
Erik (Red Riot Thot): They might have changed it because it was like 2010 when I maxed out the names. Now it just says you can't change it for 60 days
Georgia (Something Sensible): 200 people is so many to know
Jess (whoozica): these are my setting right now idk how i can make them tighter
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel like my 160 friends on fb is too many people to know XDD
Jess (whoozica): i have 288 üòÆ
Jess (whoozica): like 100 are prob my family or toms family though XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I have... 638???
Erik (Red Riot Thot): mostly high school and college people
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Ya'll so popular. So many friends lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I removed most of my high school friends. Eventually plan to remove more as time goes on but currently no beef with them, nor do we really chat soo ehh
Georgia (Something Sensible): im nixing high school friends now
Georgia (Something Sensible): _im still friends with my ex gf oops goodbye_
Georgia (Something Sensible): 192 friends now look at that cleaning
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~totally removing people as we speak lol. I had some people added from like just class groups, con groups and etc. never gonna chat to them again so byyyeee~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~removed everyone i no longer talk to from high school now, down to 130~~ <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Georgia (Something Sensible): this guy from my dorm sent me a friend request and i never answered because he was at the rutgers minicon and then saw me in cosplay at my dorm like "hey youre that girl!"
Georgia (Something Sensible): i was too awkward to ever answer
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Friends you may know is scary. I can't tell you how many of the famous cosplayers I've seen real names for.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Why does my cousin have 2 fb's??~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): im gonna change my last name to my middle name yeahhhh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): See 2 of the accounts I have friended are from people who aren't around anymore but I feel awful removing them... (One if my old dogs I made when younger for some reason aaannd the other is my childhood best friends)
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i was going to change mine to my middle name a couple years ago .. but my middle name is very strange
Georgia (Something Sensible): _are we cool enough to know what it is_
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but now that im getting weirdos trying to add me
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh its  Sommer
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I will never post my middle name fully anywhere. Only the first initial
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Sorry to my mom buuuttt ü§∑
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I know someone with sommer as a last name.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): are they cool
Georgia (Something Sensible): the track kid in my high school had that as a last name
Georgia (Something Sensible): make up a middle name rebecca
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but were they *cool* <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Georgia (Something Sensible): copy me and make it lynn, then people will think were sisters LMAO
Georgia (Something Sensible): ye he was coolio
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ok thats fair then maybe i will
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): >.>
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): <.<
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://tenor.com/view/doit-starwars-kill-gif-5023949
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Honestly Jamie has made me like my middle name some by telling me to change the spelling in my mind since Star Wars came out XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): im disappointed that facebook got rid of the option where you can see what your facebook looks like to strangers
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anyone ever find it weird when FB suggest friends parents to add? XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): yes
Jess (whoozica): lol, have you gotten my mom yet? everyone always gets her
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Make sure to turn off public friends lists. That's one of the easiest ways to stalk through others.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh yikes thank you i forgot to do that
Anna (Cadmium): lort im down to 500 friends
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I wanna just delete FB but it's the only way I communicate with my friends
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe I don't recall?  But I've gotten a lot of people in here's parents or family lol. It's currently suggesting me Erik's mom XD I mean she is very nice but don't know her well enough to add her personally lmao.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ive gotten your mom rebecca
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): xD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh dear god...
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Facebook messenger and discord are the most popular SnS these days...
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I wanted to switch off messenger though, we all know facebook reads user data.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I wish I could remember the login to my rp facebook so I could see what my account looks like from a non friend.~~
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Was thinking signal, which has end to end encryption.
Georgia (Something Sensible): i only use FB for events btbh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Another thing I need to do is stop using cosplay photo shoot pics as profile pics cause con people can find through that ay too but uughhh they are too nice to not to d:
Georgia (Something Sensible): S A M E
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh mood
Rebecca (madameterralupus): But like I never take nice pictures of myself outside of cosplay sooo XD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): like ... I JUST WANNA ALWAYS LOOK LIKE YANG
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): dsjfhasdl;fj
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i also dont want people to recognize my cosplay and try to add me
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmmm
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): the struggle
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Messenger is the only place all my friends communicate at. They barely use discord
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And they don't often get messages from discord
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just never post my actual self for profile pics except once in a blue moon cause I never take selfies outside of cosplay, have the effort to throw on makeup or etc lol
Anna (Cadmium): i use fb way too much honestly i just. cosplay photos as profile cause nothign else makes it 

SUCCESS I HAVE REMOVED MY LAST NAME
Anna (Cadmium): also can i just say how annoying it is to buy alchohol in cosplay
Anna (Cadmium): like i swear im really 22 and have blue eyes and brown hair
Georgia (Something Sensible): HUZZAH we have created another barrier against stalkers now
Jess (whoozica): i never have a problem, buying the alcohol at cons, but they do study my face closely alot
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol that little section under your profile picture seems so bare to me now that everything is jsut friends only XD
Anna (Cadmium): I mean that my cosplay last name is fake helps like. No one has the name Stazia
Erik (Red Riot Thot): got my friends list down to 500
Anna (Cadmium): N Regina isn't even my real middle name
Rebecca (madameterralupus): üòÆ
Anna (Cadmium): ~~good luck finding it except for the twenty ppl back home who know~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): _yall bitches special so you get to know my last name_
Anna (Cadmium): It's Katherine. U guys are cool so I tell u
Georgia (Something Sensible): gasp
Georgia (Something Sensible): were cool omg
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol ya'll changing your names and I've just like noooppee I refuse XD My name is too basic, plus dont want middle name out there cause ehhh

Marisa (Mawisa): <:lenny:456549338026344489>
Georgia (Something Sensible): _ye block people that are being creepy_
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *Everyone reacting valid please glare at Marisa*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Most people I have blocked are just people from my mom and I's past we don't want finding us and starting shit XD
Marisa (Mawisa): *but how do you block them if they‚Äôre in all your group chats and on a website that doesn‚Äôt have blocking features*
Marisa (Mawisa): Not this group chat
Anna (Cadmium): yikes feels
Georgia (Something Sensible): you say "dont talk to me or ill kill you"
Anna (Cadmium): i think. if you block them you dont see their stuff
Anna (Cadmium): or leave the country and start a new life

Anna (Cadmium): actually dont u just got back
