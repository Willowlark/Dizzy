Georgia (Something Sensible): Roommate update: she was staring into a bowl of cereal for like 10 minutes and then just fell asleep
Georgia (Something Sensible): At her desk
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~maybe she'll die that way~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I would feel bad for her but she was such a jerk to me about having friends over
Georgia (Something Sensible): I was like “I need them over to support me, my grandpa literally died a day ago” and she was like “how will I get my sleep?”
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. Agreed. Seems she only cares about herself
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She probably didn't clean the stick before she shoved it up her ass.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like Idk she doesn’t have any friends or leave the room
Georgia (Something Sensible): Which is probably really lonely and sucky
Georgia (Something Sensible): But it’s also probably her own fault?
Georgia (Something Sensible): Now she went back to bed
Georgia (Something Sensible): _she woke up like 10 minutes ago, stared at a bowl of cereal, and went back to bed_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good. I'd hope she's smart enough to not go to class and spread her flu around campus >.>
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~she wasn't smart enough to disinfect the stick~~
