Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I think I've officially decided I'm going to put my two weeks in at my one job next weekend... I've enjoyed my two years here but it's time for me to go... I just feel like I'm being shoved out of the door somedays and it's been really taking a toll on my mental health recently from all the stress of it .-.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I'm happy for you 😊
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I kinda really hate to leave cause there are things I like about it but currently the negatives are out weighing the positives...
Also sucks that I'm probs gonna get a little bit of  raise soon but eh 🤷🏻‍♀️

I'd rather work somewhere that will give me consistent hours, I enjoy and isn't ruining my mental health...
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That’s worth a lot. I was always strung out when I worked inconsistent hours. It’ll make a huge different to be able to separate from work.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sounds like you're leaving for all the right reasons.  Good luck finding something better
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. Thankfully I have a second job already and they seem to really like me so I don't have to worry about finding something new or worry about hours there. Plus I have a team I work with whenever in so not all the work load is dumped on me...
