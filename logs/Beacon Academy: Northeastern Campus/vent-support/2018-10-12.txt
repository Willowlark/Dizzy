Erik (slendergiant): Fuck they posted out of order
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): erik didnt you get one of those cards on your car that time
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): at ethans
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is it bad when I mentioned asshole parking notes that was the exact note I thought of? ðŸ˜‚
Erik (slendergiant): YUP
Erik (slendergiant): https://www.wittyyeti.com/collections/bad-parking-revenge-products
Jess (whoozica): Like we only have about 15 spots plz
Jess (whoozica): hes also just too damn talkative for me in the morning. he sent me an email asking to print business cards for him but i hadnt seen it yet, so he followed me to the kitchen to tell me about te email i sent and im like "???? Ill see it when i turn on my computer?" then he precedes to sit down at the lunch table and try to stike up conversation about how bored he is at home?
Jess (whoozica): why u send email if you just gonna talk to me in person anyway?
Erik (slendergiant): ~~maybe spend some time with your wife if you're bored, you fuck~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~is there a company phone directory~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~give his wife a call~~
Jess (whoozica): na lol not that i can access at least
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): unrelated, but i just realized i forgot my lunch at home and suddenly my day just turned sour
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~much like your lunch will~
Jess (whoozica): UGH THATS THE WORST
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~I'm on a stupid conference call I really don't need to input on, I have other work I could start on if I could focus, but this one woman does not how to speak concisely and her voice is super aggravating~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~at least she seems to have gotten a real mic, rather than the one she built out of sandpaper~~
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah that's the worst
Erik (slendergiant): <@334090409389195266> is there anywhere you can quick run to get something to eat? Or like, are you not allowed to leave the premises?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oh, i mean i CAN but i was looking forward to eating the leftovers from last night xD
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): a total first world problem
Jess (whoozica): 3 times, this guy asked me for his business cards 3 times, he doesnt need them till monday, I have other stuff that needs to get done today cuz it needs to be shipped, today go awayyyyy
Jess (whoozica): luckily he only works part time so he just left thank god
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Give him the file and a qr code for vistaprint.
Jess (whoozica): i have to make the file first XD hes new
Erik (slendergiant): Tell him to kindly fuck off
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~give him a blank card~~
Jess (whoozica): now we talkin
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~give him his wife's business card~~
Jess (whoozica): ~~give him the card of a marriage counselor~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): lol I was gonna say that
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): how do you cross out words?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): `~~`someothing`~~`
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): two tildes on each end?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yup./
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): cool thanks!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): or should I say
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): ~~thanks~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): __they added underline?__
Erik (slendergiant): was just about to link that xS
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's new.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ```html
<b>blah</b>
```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ```python
print("Hello World")
```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Syntax highlighting works now, sweet.
Erik (slendergiant): ```css
butt
```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): what'd you use as the language?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ```css
> be me
> making a green text
```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): oof.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nice.
Erik (slendergiant): ```css
I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just copying the example
```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): syntax highlighting. It's for code to make it easier to parse.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): This is from my editor.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): the \`\`\` format is for code blocks technically.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's more useful for standard spaced copypasta though.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You can make charts out of text.
Jess (whoozica): i dont understand any of this  ðŸ™ƒ
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): --         | Wynne | Callora | Eraia | Theanovene | Dreca
-----------|-------|---------|-------|------------|-------
Wynne      | --    | A       | T     | N          | N
Callora    | A     | --      | T     | A          | N
Eraia      | T     | T       | --    | A          | H
Theanovene | N     | A       | A     | --         | A
Dreca      | N     | N       | H     | A          | --

^ see this chart?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It looks stupid.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ```--         | Wynne | Callora | Eraia | Theanovene | Dreca
-----------|-------|---------|-------|------------|-------
Wynne      | --    | A       | T     | N          | N
Callora    | A     | --      | T     | A          | N
Eraia      | T     | T       | --    | A          | H
Theanovene | N     | A       | A     | --         | A
Dreca      | N     | N       | H     | A          | --```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Now it looks good.
Jess (whoozica): yea but how you make it doo that
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): you never used a code block?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): it's \`\`\`
blah blah blah
\`\`\`
Jess (whoozica): yea but i dnot understnad how using back ticks organizes the whole thing
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's mostly about the spaces.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): In terminal (coding) fonts, it's common to have every character with the same width.
Jess (whoozica): but thats all you did? just put the back tics around it and it does that automatically?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): When I raw pasted the chart it uses a standard font. The When it does that, the cells are no longer equal width because `E` is wider than `i` in that font.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): When using the code block font, every little is the same width, so the lines line up.
Jess (whoozica): OH ok i thoguht there was mroe too it then that
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nope. Just the font rendering.
Jess (whoozica): we call that monospacing in graphic design
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's probably whats used in CS, it's just not something I talk about much.
Jess (whoozica): so how u get colors then?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That name sounds familiar.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): The colors are syntax highlighting. Code editors often come with setups for different programming languages to highlight parts of the code to differentiate it, usually parts of the language syntax. When using a discord code block, you can specify a language for highlighting like so:

\`\`\`html
\`\`\`
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): which is 

```
<b>This is bold text</n>
<a href="image.png">Link Text</a>
```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's highlighting the html tag (which tells the html renderer how to read the content in the tag), `href` because it's a keyword tag for a `<a>` tag, and `"image.png"` because string input.
Jess (whoozica): oooo but hoe can you get just a regular word in a color? css?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It's a preprogrammed color selection, you can't specify colors yourself.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): it so happens `css`'s text formatting defaults to green.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Don't know why.
Jess (whoozica): OH OK thats what i didnt get
Jess (whoozica): i thought you could like do any color
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ```css
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
```
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That's actually CSS.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So they highlight the outer tags in green.
Jess (whoozica): but you cant actually use a tag to make your text purple for fun
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Nah.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Discord *could* implement it, it's possible, but it requires raw html rendering in text.
Jess (whoozica): ok yea thats was what i didnt get cuz i mean ite been a while and i never used it alot but i have used css and i thought you could just color your words for fun
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): <span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Yeah, no dice.
Jess (whoozica): ~~rich text editor when~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Rich text is craaaaaaap
Jess (whoozica): unless nitro has that
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): You'll never get a rich text editor in discord.
Jess (whoozica): better than coding for the average person tho no?
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Markdown is the new trend because it's easier to type as you go.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Markdown also can be compiled into html for web formatting.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): It requires next to no effort to have ~~strikethrough~~ transformed into the formatted version in the Discord backend.
Jess (whoozica): yea but most people dont know it, i think the option to just highlight your text and select bold or "green" would be easier
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ^ that is *significantly* more complicated to do.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): That implies there's metadata describing the text.
Jess (whoozica): its not if you dont know what combination does something
Jess (whoozica): i mean idk i dont code so
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): So rather than discord parsing the raw text, discord has to parse the file in the back end for the metadata and the raw text.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): More complicated to implement in code.
Jess (whoozica): ~~i dont know what parse means~~
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): read.
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): open.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): me entering this conversation:
https://media.giphy.com/media/ITwncOFEqwisg/giphy.gif
Jess (whoozica): understandable
Jess (whoozica): anyway, yea i dont know how all the back ground stuff works so opinion invalid
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): ~~my opinion is invalid because you don't understand it?~~
Jess (whoozica): No
Jess (whoozica): MY opinion
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): aah.
Jess (whoozica): I'm just saying markdown isn't second nature for alot of people so like in my case if I wanna make something bold, I have to Google how many *s makes it bold so it gets inconvenient
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): my website is written in markdown, so I'm biased....
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): but I think the hardest part of markdown is how facebook uses different notation from everyone else.
Jess (whoozica): I mean I understand why it would be easier AFTER you know it
