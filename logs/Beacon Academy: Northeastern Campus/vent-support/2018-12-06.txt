Erik (Red Riot Thot): Tonight just is not my night. Attempted Kirishima gears and they didn't work out and I ran out of my thick foam doing so, so I had to order more. Then as I was getting ready for bed I remembered that I needed to do laundry because I'm out of underwear so here I am doing laundry at midnight 🙃
Georgia (Something Sensible): oof at least you remembered now and not in the morning
Georgia (Something Sensible): when going to change your underwear
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I considered using those spandex shorts I got but after trying them on again decided they were not an acceptable alternative
Georgia (Something Sensible): So it’s a Wednesday night and Noah’s roommate has put away a huge bottle of whiskey
Georgia (Something Sensible): He just spilled a bag of Doritos all over the floor
Georgia (Something Sensible): And now he’s waving around a pink dildo and talking about sounding Noah
Georgia (Something Sensible): We saw him earlier today smoking a cigar and skipping class
Georgia (Something Sensible): How does one... intervene...
Georgia (Something Sensible): He has now taken off his clothes and is trying to hang Christmas lights
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Thank you for that play-by-play. That just made my night 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): hes now eating the floor doritos and staring at himself in the mirror
Georgia (Something Sensible): he put on a fuzzy cape thing? still no shirt tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): im genuinely concerned about Noahs roomie, hes a good guy, but he apparently got dumped bad in september
Georgia (Something Sensible): and has not been sober for more than 24 hours since
Georgia (Something Sensible): so  while i am genuinely concerned for his well being
Georgia (Something Sensible): i also have to appreciate him eating doritos off the floor
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oof
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): The floor Doritos is a mood
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): We’ve all been there before
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Also <@!386874959009415170> what went wrong with the gears??
Erik (Red Riot Thot): The shape didn't come out right and they looked atrocious
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I don't want to present. I hate talking in front of large groups of people~~ 🙃
Jess (whoozica): a mood
Jess (whoozica): is it your final?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee we just have to present about the one paper we did on a communication theory. I know I got all the information I need but I still constantly worry I am missing something and going to mess up
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~I am next cause Chris just went and Rachel is going now. RIP~~
Jess (whoozica): youll be ok! just remember once you get through this you are in the clear!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Aside from final test for the class indeed I am!! WOO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🙌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): > Me: has a presentation to go by so doesn't panic
> Also me: Panics straight away and jumps all over presentation and sounds even stupider
Jess (whoozica): AWWW are you done though?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa >.< I hope I did okay.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just get up there, panic and rush through my stuff that I feel I sound dub XD
Jess (whoozica): nah i think everyone does that XD or at least half
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): if it makes you feel any better about it, during my senior speech i choked on my own spit and announced it to the entire class
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao Leanna!  Oh nooo! I mean... honestly I'd probs do the same. I always choke on my own words and end up sounding like an old man trying to clear my throat and get back ot what I was saying XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My senior design project was the 2nd year in a multi-year project so we inherited the actual design from the previous year's class and our industry advisor told us *pretty early on* that the design would never actually be suitable for what it was intended (helicopter gear box) so we had to present some pretty bullshit stuff to a few dozen industry professionals
Jess (whoozica): OOF
Marisa (Mawisa): there was a major phone outage across the country today for like 6 hours and no one knows why. the company hasn't said anything <:rip:378273525804433408>
Marisa (Mawisa): i couldn't use my phone on the subway to look at memes it was torture
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): OOF
Jess (whoozica): how dare
Marisa (Mawisa): the outage map
Marisa (Mawisa): also it killed a lot of robots
those AI robots like Pepper who serve as greeters at fancy stores all died so there were just unmoving robots in all these fancy stores
Jess (whoozica): NO 😭
Marisa (Mawisa): at least Japan still has public phone booths!! i see them used occasionally but today there were lines for the public phone booths outside of stations
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Damn that's a bug ass area for a phone outage 😱
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like almost the entire country holy shit
Marisa (Mawisa): yup yup
the closest place that had coverage was 13 hours north by bullet train
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *wondering what that comment is supposed to be on Rebecca’s behalf*
Jess (whoozica): What do you mean? 😮
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I have no idea what that comment means.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What the person commented?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Particularly “normal perspective”
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm not totally sure either tbh but I was just like uhh okay yea sure thanks xD
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Hey, it's more compliments that I've ever gotten from randos!
Jamie (Jamie): Finally got my interview rescheduled 🙃  turned out the thought i had of the lady having personal ongoings was right and she had been out of the office due to a family emergency. So Yay i wasn't being job ghosted lol
Jamie (Jamie): But would have been nice for someone there to let me know this still lol
Jamie (Jamie): But now i go Monday for the interview and hopefully make awesome impression and land myself into the start of decent paying jobs lol
