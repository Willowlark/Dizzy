Anna [Cyborg]: i mean. it does. it does contain one pesron. shoes. and an outdoor
Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): #truth
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Welp sucks it down but glad it's not just me having problems
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah been having issues with stories today as well
Anna [Cyborg]: always on a wednesday too
Anna [Cyborg]: I just went to taco Bell and they were out of tortillas. How the f*** are you out of tortillas
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Buy not knowing how to manage a business and ordering what you need on time apparently... lol
Jamie (Jamie): fuck i hate have to not include friends in things let alone explain to them why and also knowing that they are not in the best mental state
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ˜¦
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof I'm sorry :/
Jamie (Jamie): let alone that the reason is because not a good mental state and not wanting them around the drinking that can make it worse
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee that's understandable.
Jamie (Jamie): plus theyre already kinda constant dark cloud aura around them
Jamie (Jamie): and also light regret being friends with a pair of sisters where one is slowly becoming more of a depresssed person in a toxic way as she continues life
Anna [Cyborg]: maybe make it an excuse of you're trying to acclimate some friends to other friends slowly and not everyone all at once
Jamie (Jamie): well the hard part is that her younger sister is here and so its like telling her dont want you only shes allowed and i feel crappy doing that
Anna [Cyborg]: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm maybe lie and say you thought they were busy?
Jamie (Jamie): she has tho in the past stayed with us and woke us up at 4 am screaming into a phone and crying obnoxiously (granted good reason because POS bf of time who now gone but still)
Anna [Cyborg]: idk not fun situatoin
Jamie (Jamie): yea no she asked to come i thought her current boi would be coming so i said ya found out he's not coming so no one to keep her mind occupied and words from her mother to her sister that he is on a vacation and away and she is being very depressed (and from the seems of it jealous that her sister is here with me without her)
Jamie (Jamie): i'm just trying to push the i dont want her to get hurt and we can hang out another time when alcohol not involved or she is in a better head space

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'd say since the sister is there see if she can help by saying something like that. It's not that you don't wanna see her it's just you don't want issues cause of being in a bad place mentally right now.
Anna [Cyborg]: I feel like I got the reverse end of the usual lecture from parents. My mom basically asked me why I didn't go to art school and do costuming if I like it so much (in nicer words)
Bruh
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao that is like the reverse of a normal lecture when it comes to school xD
Anna [Cyborg]: Just goes to show
Even if you do engineering and get a job 
Your parents will still question your career choice.
Anna [Cyborg]: At least I like it here at RAEL
