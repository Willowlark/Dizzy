Rebecca (madameterralupus): I for the life of me cannot focus on writing just 3 fucking paragraphs for this group essay >.< Ughhh
Marisa (Mawisa): Annette imagine that same exact scenario but he shouted “HEWWO?!” instead. Would that make you more or less scared.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Great start to the week -_-
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465> Oh nooo. What happened??
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Mostly just my wrist acting up bc I have been hella straining it but it was too painful at work so I caved
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Just want it to be okay for the weekend ;-;
Anna (loud and likely blonde): But is pain
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Old Injury plus carpal tunnel is the TLDR
ZombieHunter: Me: I wanna write bumblebee fanfiction
Inner me: write dungeon porn 
😐
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~do it~~
ZombieHunter: ~~You have to beta read it~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~aight xD~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): Ugh they cancelled class tomorrow meaning all quizzes Tuesday are Friday oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): I emailed my professor if I could have a make up because I have “familial commitments” Friday
Georgia (Something Sensible): DABS I get to take the quiz Thursday morning
Georgia (Something Sensible): Not gonna lie it’s probably only cause I came to office hours last week so I’m on the professors good side; he normally doesn’t offer make up quizzes
Mark (Mad Doctor): We have a two hour delays tomorrow which means I have to postpone the tests I was going to give until Weds/Thurs. Chance that these are getting graded this weekend?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee we have a 2 hour delay which means no classes for me. But extra packing time~ worried though we're gonna move what we were to do tomorrow on radio to thurs and I won't get to leave as early >.<
Erik (Red Riot Thot): <@227431823062466569> why not both?
ZombieHunter: Because dirty
Jess (whoozica): Ugh I just called out in preparation for the show but I'm afraid the weather will lie to be and be fine and then ill look like a fool. And in also afraid of getting in trouble since Im taking vacation this too
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's weird calling out in prep for a storm tonight.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I had the same issue this morning.
Jess (whoozica): Yea 😳 hopefully he doesn't refuse to pay me this time.
Jess (whoozica): I thought we'd have snow by now
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): think the snow doesn't start till 11, but it's going to hammer us.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 4-8 last I checked.
Jess (whoozica): And like an ass load of freezing rain
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ye.
Jess (whoozica): I live close to work so everyone makes fun of me for calling out but I live on a mountain
Jess (whoozica): And my car sucks in snow so fuck em
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I've strategically only told horror stories about snow and our area. They must think I literally live on a cliff with a winding dirt road uphill both ways.
Jess (whoozica): Yes most people I work with know where my house is
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Late to.the chat but I can't have whatever hair I want i.wiah I could. I want a job that leta me dye my hair and have tattoos but pays at least 14 an hour XD
Jess (whoozica): Mood
Anna (loud and likely blonde): keep your eyes open for self storage facility management and for engineering firm secretary jobs cause. those pay well. and self storage gives no fucks usually
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I knew a guy who apparently played league all night at his night guard job.
Jess (whoozica): Tom's work pays 15 minimum and you can do whatever whatever you want to your hair and tattoos are fine
Jess (whoozica): At least I think that's the minimum now
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀
Anna (loud and likely blonde): you could also look for like. security jobs. Like working dispatch for security.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~I need a new job before I murder someone at my current job, tall are giving me ideas~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): https://www.thorlabs.com/CareersByCountry.cfm#/US put newton into the search box.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 👀  thank
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): if you were to apply tell Tom/Dave/Ash, they can probably put in a good word?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Will do
Anna (loud and likely blonde): o yea im basing this all without knowing wtf yall actually have experience/degrees/proficiency in what all u job searching ppl do
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh yeah, you got your job through the NY graduate program right?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *~also searches jobs~*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I will *eventually* get motivation to find something not in the city.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): nah i had to apply to jobs like a pleb i was just forced to apply bc i had to work as a contractual part of one of my grants.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~ill eventually get a job i can use public transport to get to~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~it's decidedly overrated do not~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ok but if i work for the mta i get free rides
Anna (loud and likely blonde): my car is nearing 200K miles pls public transport
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you also *work for the MTA*.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I know a guy with LIRR and that's hellish apparently.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): the lirr is a special brand of hell in all aspects. 
Nah i wanna work on the engineering side. im dying for a public sector job private is so intense.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~or ill see if i can work for the DOT or something~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's a big paycut.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): its not really im not making bank here
Anna (loud and likely blonde): entry level is basically the same
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Government pay scale runs slower than private sector.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): plus god forbid another shutdown...
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yeah except im not really planning on getting my PE so its not like i'd be climbing the scale.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): nope city gov dot doesnt shut down in the same way 
id rather get a job i like more than one that pays bank. 
either way my main experience currently is in NYC plans
Erik (Red Riot Thot): yeah, fuck being a PE
Anna (loud and likely blonde): like i *like* builders pavement plans but also fuck builders pavement plans
Erik (Red Riot Thot): big mood there
Anna (loud and likely blonde): fuck the PE like i dont have the brain for that. even though its like really important in civil
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~still gotta take my FE rip~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): someone yell at me this summer to sign up for it and take it in like december
Erik (Red Riot Thot): do you really need it if you have no plans to pursue PE?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *oh fuckin' sweet, Thor Labs has an ME1 position open*
Anna (loud and likely blonde): kinda? Most public sector jobs require it in a way and employers really like to see it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That'd be... a 2 hour commute? lol
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~doesnt Erik want to move?~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~not to a jersey apartment alone~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~just get a job in jersey too move in with him its fine~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Jersey is a huge cost jump from PA.
Jess (whoozica): ~~newton is 30 mins from Dingmans Ferry, PA~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oh tru.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~im dead moving into NYC this year so im feeling the pain of price jumps~~
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ye I'd probably move to northern PA
Jess (whoozica): Granted you ain't getting to work in the winter but yea alot of people that work there live in PA
Anna (loud and likely blonde): why must jobs and friends be separated by such distances
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): according to Zillow there's one rental in dingman township.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~4 bedroom for 1700 a month + utilities though
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~what a bargain~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't really know, the most apartment shopping I've looked is that price for 2 bedroom apartment, or more expensive for the same.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~thats actually pretty cheap but theres def a catch.~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): no pets.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): i meant like crazy neighbor
Jess (whoozica): It's all late communities up there, maybe you have to go through that? Idk unless you live by Milford it feels so isolated so I never really looked there
Erik (Red Riot Thot): actually, considering a lot of 1 bedroom apartments are like $1k minimum, 4 bedroom for $1700 actually isn't bad
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): 1k for a 1 bedroom. PA really is cheap.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If only their liquor laws weren't bullshit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~and I commute to NYC~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): fuck it im moving to PA before i die 
maybe ill find my grandparents old house up for sale.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): meanwhile jersey
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~wait nvm it was like 40 acres on the side of the  delaware in the middle of fucking nowhere on a dirt road i rescind my statement~~
Anna (loud and likely blonde): rip that looks like long island pricing
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Cheapest and closest I could find is in East Stroudsburg... which is still 50 minutes away... oof... maybe not
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): get the job first!
Jess (whoozica): East Stroudsburg isn't the best city to live in either. They are putting in more housing in Newton to accomodate Thor Newton isn't ussually too bad in rent prices and least when u was looking
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~Newton isn't happy about it~~
Jess (whoozica): Yea I hate when a company brings reliable jobs to a dying town
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Twas talking to a cop from Byram, apparently older residents of Newton don't like "the type of people housing has brought in."
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ah, fossilized racists
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don't shoot the messenger.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~same with my old town they were gonna build an IBM building there but 'the traffic!' was the war cry by the old coots~~
Jess (whoozica): We're not lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): pfft IBM.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They're.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): fun.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): so like. still no business in my old town. barely
Jess (whoozica): 👎
Anna (loud and likely blonde): thats ok bc its just turning into a town with auto shops and coffee. and one nerd shop
Anna (loud and likely blonde): old people ruin everything
Erik (Red Riot Thot): There's an apartment like 7 minutes away for $1,125 for 1 bed 1 bath... possibly doable... also allows cats
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): oooh, live in newton ye
Erik (Red Riot Thot): aaaaand applied
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am so damned tired of having phone issues....
Matt (mattmyers25): Switch to android
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I cant. Not until my whatever is up.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I still have to pay this one off and I'm not due for a new oe yet
Anna (loud and likely blonde): too bad my other phone shit itself or i'd let you have it till you could upgrade
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷 I got one just having to reset it up is so annoying >.<
Rebecca (madameterralupus): The previous one worked fie aside from the fact everyone said they couldnt hear me when they called me...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Ok, so stupid thing that's pissing me off right now. My browser isn't opening PDF hyperlinks from our intranet in a new tab (like it normally does), but rather opening a save window. It opens PDF hyperlinks from other websites in new tabs, and my settings are set so it opens in a new tab, and it's only my computer doing it...
Anna (loud and likely blonde): u ever just. eat something sweet and feel it. sink into your teeth and your mouth explodes in pain. 
guess i have more cavities.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): >.< my phone didn't back up properly so I lost anyone's number or address I gained since... last katsu... FUCK
Rebecca (madameterralupus): If you... have my number can you just send me a text who you are so I can resave it 😭
Georgia (Something Sensible): There’s this one kid in physics that a lot of the other majors tend to dismiss cause sometimes he asked “stupid” questions
Georgia (Something Sensible): I mean they’re elementary physics questions but some of the other peeps judge him for it
Georgia (Something Sensible): But I’m in a lab for Tuesday (I usually go Thursday) and I walked in looking all lost and he was like HEY GEORGIA YA NEED A LAB PARTNER?
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s sad to see people judge someone so friendly
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Props to him for asking those questions if he genuinely doesn't understand them. If I had a "dumb question" because I didn't know something that was probably basic, I never asked because I didn't want to sound like an idiot or hold up the class, which sometimes lead to frustration not understanding something
Mark (Mad Doctor): Nine times out of ten, the rest of the class is relieved when the Stupid Question is asked
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Yea someone who I hadnt seen in many years told me yesterday " it takes a lot of courage to raise your hand and ask those questions. Usually the best of the best are the kids who raise their hand in class to ask those questions that might seem dumb. But they have to have a lot of respect for themselves and an insane drive to do well." 
That fits really well in this situation ~~even if he was talking to my brother about the army~~
