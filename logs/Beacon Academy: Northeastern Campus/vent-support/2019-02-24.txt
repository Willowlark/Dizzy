Erik (Red Riot Thot): So my anonymous admirer came out and DM'd me. She was very sweet about it. Do you think this was an okay response?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Not that it really matters now because I already sent it, but like, I always feel bad rejecting people and I don't want to hurt their feelings
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): I think itâ€™s fine... if itâ€™s the one from the tellonym you already established before she said anything what she wanted wouldnâ€™t work for you, so she probably confessed to get it off her chest and move on.
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I agree with Bill
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): You had already stated your feelings, so if she ends up trying to start something eith you then she is being unreasonable.
