Mark (Mad Doctor): Two hour delay: yay!
Shoveling three tons of slush before work: boo!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We didn't have a delay and I'm very salty about it >.>
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I took a sick day. Whatever I had the past two weeks came back full force with a cough on top and my throat is so raw from coughing that I can't talk.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): This plus going through a down period plus a friend passing is not a good way to start March.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ok so I emailed the guy who was supposed to call me Friday for that job, and he replied saying he never received a response from me??? Like, I was the one who said noon on Friday and he said he could do that and he was "looking forward to it" so I guess because I didn't send another follow-up he assumed I didn't confirm it? Even though I was the one who set up the time and day? Like, wtf
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like at this point I don't even want to talk to him now
Chris Onyx: Nani the fuck
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```Hello Erik,
Thank you for your interest in [company].

I have reviewed your resume and would like to schedule a phone call to discuss our Associate Mechanical Engineer position. Please let me know your availability this week for a 15 - 30 minute phone call so that we can discuss your qualifications.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Cheers,
Matt```
```Good morning Matt,

Would you be able available to talk around noon this Friday?

Thanks,
Erik```
```Erik,

I can give you a call on Friday at 12PM. Looking forward to it.

Thanks,
Matt```
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Like, that sounds like a confirmed call to me???
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Was I really supposed to also say "Looking forward to it"?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): that seems a bit much
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea... that sounds like a confirmation call to me as well. From both sides. What the hell...
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ```Hello Matt, 

I was disappointed to not receive a call yesterday regarding the Associate Mechanical Engineering position. I hope all is well and would be happy to reschedule if possible. Noon tends to work best for me. Looking forward to your response. 

Thank you, 
Erik```
```Erik,

Unfortunately I never received a response from you re: your availability. If you have some time this morning/noon, Iâ€™m happy to jump on a call.

Thanks,
Matt```

Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): what a douche.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats so ridiculous
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ™„
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I responded saying we could talk today. I wanted to call him out but there wasn't any way to do so without coming off snarky
Erik (Red Riot Thot): "As per *your* last email, I thought we had discussed a call at 12pm on Friday..."
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Adult speak for "bitch can u read"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I hope I'm not getting sick cause im really tired the past few days and my head has been hurting on and off..
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ok well, just had my call with the dude. he was actually really nice and pleasant to talk with
Erik (Red Riot Thot): he went through the rundown of the interview process and holy shit it's intense and very intimidating
Erik (Red Riot Thot): so like this was the phone screen, then he's meeting with the managers to pick from the candidates for a 30 minute phone interview with the manager
Erik (Red Riot Thot): then if you get through that, they bring you in for an on-site "assessment activity" where you'll be presented with an engineering problem and they see how you go about solving it
Erik (Red Riot Thot): then if you pass that, they bring you in for like a 2 hour panel interview where they'll discuss things from pre-college all the way to present day
Erik (Red Riot Thot): so like....
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ðŸ‘€ oh damn
Erik (Red Riot Thot): VERY nervous about any and all of that
Erik (Red Riot Thot): but my salary requirements were in the ballpark they had in mind for this position
Erik (Red Riot Thot): and 401k

Evie (Katheryne Knight): Because I make the funniez OwO
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): yeah no that whole group looked cute!
Rebecca (madameterralupus): How many times do I have to tell people I don't like being called "Becca" or "Becky" and they still fucking do it... for fuck same..
Georgia (Something Sensible): tell them if they must use "becky", they have to use it in full: "Her Royal Highness Becky, Queen of Mortals, Empress of All Beings, Commander of the High Council of Life"
Georgia (Something Sensible): and only then will you accept the title
Marisa (Mawisa): What about webecca uwu
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats too close to weebecca
Marisa (Mawisa): Yeah her real name
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol no, still has Becky in the name. I can't stand it.. XD
Webecca... eh that's fine. Lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): the "w" and two "c"s make me think of Chewbacca
Georgia (Something Sensible): _Chewbecca_
Georgia (Something Sensible): BNE star wars AU when
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <:fingerguns:453385855470534657> Call me Chewie~
