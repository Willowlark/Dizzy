Erik (Red Riot Thot): So I got my current job through a recruiter friend of mine and she contacted me a few days ago about a new job that she thought I might be a good fit for. I have to revise my resume to give to her to give to the company but hopefully something will come of that. She said "It reminded me of where you're at but *a lot* more organized." Only about like 40 employees which makes me a little nervous because that's only like twice what we have, but a lot of them are experienced engineers so like that's a significant increase in the number of experienced engineers I currently work with (which is zero). Pays *very* well, good benefits, and potential to grow within the company, so like, fingers crossed 🤞
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): the important question is where is it. 👀
Mark (Mad Doctor): Sounds promising. Hope you find a situation where you look forward to going to work

Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That a lot of bank tho. 😬
Anna (Loud, blonde, and angery): Yeah 
So anyways I wasn't making enough progress fast enough in the small office so they said they would give me a reference but I need a bigger place to work in
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): They could have. Done that and actually fired you after you got a new job.
Anna (Loud, blonde, and angery): Yeah no I got told today was my last dat
Anna (Loud, blonde, and angery): Day
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): “We’re trying to be nice about it but your fired.” What dicks.
Anna (Loud, blonde, and angery): I should have known this was coming tbh
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nah you strike me as someone who actually gets shit done at work. This on them, you shouldn’t be looking over your shoulder like you’re a slacker. Blame them, sounds like they’re the fuck iOS.
Matt (mattmyers25): I agree with bill
Anna (Loud, blonde, and angery): no everone else was progressing faster than me so. i should have seen it coming
Anna (Loud, blonde, and angery): now if the fucking NYC website would let me create a password it would be great
Anna (Loud, blonde, and angery): anyone got a good resume template for post-graduation work i dont know how to write my program proficiency
Anna (Loud, blonde, and angery): im over my anger im just sad now
Anna (blonde and sad): and i have no booze
Anna (blonde and sad): which i guess is good
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You don't happen to know LaTex do you?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The template I use is LaTex but has gotten praise from anyone whose ever reviewed it... I updated mine in September so it's got an expanded section for my current job, but I haven't used it to get a job as of yet so I dunno if it's the *best* way of doing it.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I'll DM it to you.
Anna (blonde and sad): nope idk what that is
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It's like word, but a programming language, and I hate it. But it makes really well formatted documents.
Anna (blonde and sad): well this is definitely gonna fuck up my RTX plans
