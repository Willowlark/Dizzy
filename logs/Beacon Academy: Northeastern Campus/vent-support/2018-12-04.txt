Rebecca (madameterralupus): >.< I get to find out who I got for my secret santa at work today... oh god I hope it's someone easy to buy for and I'm buds with ~~Mostly fine with everyone but one person, like everyone else lmao~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Can you trade if you get someone you don’t like? Or is that a no no?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~trade with whoever got you and then just buy yourself something~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean I made a small pact with my one good bud there that if we get someone we don't know what to get for them we may trade names or help each other out. We also just hope we get each others names XD
~~Everyone on the list is fine just literally no one wants the one lady. Like no one really likes her, RIP~~
Jess (whoozica): just get her a candle
Marisa (Weeb): secret santa blood oath
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We also kept finding coworkers we do like and think are cool to put their name on so we had more cool people options
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And lol... I meaaaannn my coworker Mark said to just get her a pack of cigarettes if we get her XDD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Get her an A.C. Moore giftcard
Marisa (Weeb): a kigurumi
Jess (whoozica): my work does white elephant instead which is ok but then you can get anyone anything personal
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~I mya of may not have put that on my list of things I'd be cool with XDD lmao~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): But her a car air freshener
Marisa (Weeb): fake tattoos of dinosaurs
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Oooo I like that option^^
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Get her a air freshener and a pack of cigs.. All set XD
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Give her the coupon section of the newspaper
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel bad no one likes her really but like at the same time she acts like no one knows anything, yet she doesn't know anything and she's just annoying. Always kinda up in your business in ways
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Apparently someone seems to have hacked my apple account?? I haven't bought music in ages... and I deff don't listen to whoever the fuck this is
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~looking further and further into all the stuff dealing with music of my apple accounts this seems to be a fraud email? ~~ 🤔
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~still going to make sure I wasn't actually charged for this~~
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): Lol wtf
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm so confused... why does weird shit like this keep happening to me 😫 ~~it seems to be a fraud cause I wasn't charged thank god but still accckk~~
Marisa (Weeb): music artists getting desperate for new fans
Marisa (Weeb): [commits fraud] now they *have* to listen to my songs
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao I mean U2 a few years ago did have an album automatically upload to all iPhones when released xD pissed a ton of people off
Marisa (Weeb): yeah that was horrible and it would autoplay on my phone for some reason
Jess (whoozica): mr i hate my wife just told coworker to enjoy his bought lunches now cuz "once you get married you cant buy lunch out  anymore"???
Marisa (Weeb): wow it must be such a burden to have someone lovingly hand craft your meals every day
Jess (whoozica): i mentioned htat my husband buys lunch and he was like "oh you allow him that much allowence?"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Geez idk who his wife is but I feel bad for her.. she deserves better
Jess (whoozica): right geez
Marisa (Weeb): time to crack down on tom's eating habits
Jess (whoozica): so i said we dont have allowances in my marriage
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol allowances.. yea like you're gonna treat your husband (or wife) like your child.. da fuq
Jess (whoozica): like i know hes "joking" but how much of it isnt a joke?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Doesn't really sound like jokes at all..,
Jess (whoozica): right?! like bro stop being miserable, stop telling the engaged dude marriage sucks cuz that shit is annoying
Rebecca (madameterralupus): He needs a foot up his ass
Marisa (Weeb): it's super common here for wives to manage the finances and give their husbands an allowance but also the wife does everything related to finances like pay bills and invest, and apparently it started because guys would spend too much money on after work beers because companies require their workers to go drinking to bond after work.
but this ain't the US
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And like if he thinks marriage sucks or he hates his wife then why did he get married??
Jess (whoozica): exactly!
Jess (whoozica): one day im just gonna be like bro why are u even married
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol do it
