Georgia (Something Sensible): i hate math why did i major in physics <:pyrrhascream:378296738160574465>
Erik (slendergiant): Math is fun when it's not calculus or abstract algebra
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~i lowkey actually love calculus~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~also trig~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): ~~fuckin triangles man theyre the answer to everything~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Lol ~wanna do my stat hw then~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I probably could tbh 
Stat is something i gotta deal with constantly in my major
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Wanna do my Public Policy homework I'll trade
Georgia (Something Sensible): Id take public policy over special relativity
Georgia (Something Sensible): special relativity be like "yeah that bitch yeets at the speed of light so time doesnt exist"
Georgia (Something Sensible): and im like nani
Erik (slendergiant): Yo trig actually was pretty neato
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Math sucks, I was one course from a math minor and I was like fuck that, any more math and I'll die.
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Triangles are the answer to so much
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Trig is so cool
Erik (slendergiant): Calc 1 was alright but once we delved into Taylor series bullshit in calc 2, I was over it. And calc 3 was an absolute nightmare
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I have never once enjoyed a math class
Erik (slendergiant): Diff Eq wasn't too bad and neither was linear algebra
Georgia (Something Sensible): i take up to calc 5, end me
Georgia (Something Sensible): we do diff eq as calc 4 and then partial diff as calc 5
Erik (slendergiant): ~~I minored in math because I only had to take two extra classes and both fulfilled requirements toward my major~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): You know hitchhikers guide 
The answer 42?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Its just 14 sets of 3s
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~I could have done that and yeeted the fuck out of there~~
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 14 triangles
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://giphy.com/gifs/tylermenzel-dab-triangle-3oz8xPyx3qgq5jAmMo
Erik (slendergiant): I think partial diff was covered in our regular diff eq class
Erik (slendergiant): Do I remember anything from any of my math courses? That's a big fat **no**
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): you *DO NOT* need academia level math outside of Academia.
Georgia (Something Sensible): college is a lie
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~despite the fact I don't understand the models I work on~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): But that's statistical analysis, which is different.
Erik (slendergiant): I have used calculus a grand total of zero times since I graduated
Erik (slendergiant): *two and a half years ago*
ZombieHunter: But <@!184437198865563648>  I’m a math major
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Georgia (Something Sensible): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Erik (slendergiant): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Erik (slendergiant): If you have to take modern algebra for your major, I'm so sorry
ZombieHunter: I have options
ZombieHunter: Sort of
ZombieHunter: Abstract algebra... or...
ZombieHunter: Real analysis
Erik (slendergiant): I know it was required for math majors at my school
Erik (slendergiant): Abstract
Erik (slendergiant): It also didn't help that it was very proof based and I didn't take the class that's supposed to basically teach you how to do those 😅
Georgia (Something Sensible): frankly there should be two types of math majors available, but all i know of is one
Georgia (Something Sensible): like applied mechanical math and the theroetical math
Georgia (Something Sensible): cause theyre SO different idk how math majors do it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Just what I wanted to come home to... my crunchy roll account getting hacked
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Whoever hacked it is DUMB cause it emails me letting me know >.>
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And it looks like they bought something through my account cause I was charged $3 something
Jess (whoozica): Wtffff
Erik (slendergiant): Of all the kinds of accounts to hack, why would someone hack an anime streaming account?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right??
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): lol last month I got an email from a website called Animoto that I used in TENTH GRADE for ONE SINGLE PROJECT that my account got hacked a couple months before and that the person may have gotten info about me but its like nothing is on there except my name and some silly video I made
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm see stuff like that I don't worry about. But like an account I use all the time annndd the fact I got charged for something pisses me off 😫
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also DA FUQ kinda email is this?!?!
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): you should use that to subscribe to a shit ton of stupid websites to get back at him
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): if its real lol
Marisa (Weeb): omg people used to beg for crunchyroll accounts all the time. at least twice a day i'd have to tell someone off because "i just want to watch anime but not pay for an account, can someone lend me their login info?"
some worker for a virtual currency company?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmfao Monica XD
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): or just do it for a lot of porn sites XD
Marisa (Weeb): http://www.mailbait.info/
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I tried logging into crunchyroll to make sure it wasnt a scam email or anything... nope wouldnt let me in D:
ZombieHunter: My Roleplay partner was hit by a car
ZombieHunter: 😐
ZombieHunter: I’m worried and he isn’t answering me
Marisa (Weeb): how recent did that happen?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): .-. I can't get into my damn account. The link I click on makes me sign in... How am i to sign in when they changed the email.
Marisa (Weeb): oo that'll require e-mailing support. crunchyroll is blocked in this country so i can't get on the site but they should have a "contact us" page somewhere that doesn't require logging in
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I just messaged there facebook and it gave me an automated reply to their help page. Hopefully I can find something there
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Whoever did this I reaaallly dislike right now >.>
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): *spam their email!!*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Since I can't get into my crunchyroll account... whilst I wait on them to get back to me I reported the purchase to paypal...
Marisa (Weeb): oo that's a really good idea. forward thinking
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hoping crunchyroll gets back to me soon. I am worried on whoever hacked it purchasing more if they already purchased one thing... D:
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): yeah 😕
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like look if ya gonna purchase something... bill yourself bbuuuttt still send it to me XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): lol jk
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh good because I filed that the payment from crunchyroll was unauthorized they cancelled any further payments from them until further notice.
Erik (slendergiant): Boss came into my office like, first thing this morning to ask me what I was working on and then went on rambling for 10 minutes about everything he wants me to do that could have been summed up in about two sentences... most of which were things that he's already told me he wants me to be working on... I was just like *leeeeeaaaaave so I can actually work on this shit*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof how annoying. I hate when people can't get to the point of what they want you to get done lol.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Also update: PayPal denied my unauthorized request 😫 so I may have to call them and bitch. I'm not risking this person who hacked it to buy more and drain my account...
Jess (whoozica): Can you unlink your bank account for now? ~~im.mot really sure how PayPal works~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Possibly. Gonna see what more I can do when home. In the meantime I called my mom to let her know about it. She's just gonna call the bank and have them freeze my account for the time being until we get it solved 🙃
Jess (whoozica): Ok, that's good at least 😖
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I am so confused. So I requested to change my password for CR. It sent me an email to change it. I did. And I got in...??
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I look to see where the email was changed and nothing is there? I think for the time being imma cancel my premium, unlink my paypal until further figure this out.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Whoever hacked it though I can see up-ed my premium membership to the more expensive one >.> That's why I was charged the extra amount..
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And they watch 2 episodes of One Piece?? Lmfao WAT
Jess (whoozica): Wtffff
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~of course they watched one piece~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like... What?? XD I figured they would have done more damage. Glad they didn't but like... if ya wanted to watch the first episode of One Piece, you could probs find it pirated online XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Finally got my laptop back today. Seems they replaced the hard drive? Not totally sure but everything is gone but it's still the main shell case with all my stickers lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): about to have a secret meeting with the owner of the company to try and get one of my bosses fired.. im very nervous. I rarely speak up like this, but a lot of employees and myself have been suffering due to this womans behavior
Distant Thunders: You can do this!
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): 😭 thank you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof. Good luck.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Stepping up is important.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): Update: it went well. Shes going to talk to the tyrant and try and figure out what to do after talking to her. Ahe was very unhappy to hear about everything that had been happening. I'm glad I spoke up.
Erik (slendergiant): Good!
Mark (Mad Doctor): Well done!
Mark (Mad Doctor): That took guts
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Proud of you!!!!
