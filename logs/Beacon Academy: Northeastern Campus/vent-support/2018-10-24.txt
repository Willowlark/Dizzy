Georgia (Something Sensible): So my roommate just came back and immediately went to bed
Georgia (Something Sensible): She turned off the light (she noticed I was studying but like... okay)
Georgia (Something Sensible): She hates when my night lights are on, my computer is on, I’m typing, I’m eating, and crinkling paper

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wait wait what...she turned the light out on you when you were doing work??
Rebecca (madameterralupus): And good. Yes. Agreed with Marisa. Just keep doing you.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah lmao she didn’t even say anything, she just walked in, turned off the light, and crawled into bed
Rebecca (madameterralupus): HOW FUCKING RUDE
Georgia (Something Sensible): Now, will my roommate try to murder me, that’s the million dollar question
Georgia (Something Sensible): do i date turn on my desk lamp too
Marisa (Weeb): ~~it might be hard to see in the dark~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Why the hell not. You were doing work in *your* room and she rudely turned it off in you soo

Georgia (Something Sensible): like... yo..... shes supposed to be moving out but when
Erik (slendergiant): *probably at the end of the school year*
Georgia (Something Sensible): our window is the one above the entrance to the dorm so ive been highkey thinking of getting a cardboard cut out of a celebrity and putting it in front of the window
Georgia (Something Sensible): maybe thatll be the final straw
Erik (slendergiant): *do it*
Marisa (Weeb): a dakimakura
Jess (whoozica): YAS
Erik (slendergiant): A cardboard cutout of Pyrrha
Marisa (Weeb): that rick & morty dakimakura that was so distracting when the vendor displayed it at otakon it lowered the rest of her sales
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yes plz do
Georgia (Something Sensible): omg she literally pulled the blankets over her head
Georgia (Something Sensible): 💪 dominance of the room has been achieved 💪
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good. Exactly as she should do *instead of fucking complaining and being an ass back*
Matt (mattmyers25): Just say there is a spider in the room
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol what the fuck is that gonna do Matt? 😂
Matt (mattmyers25): Scare her
Rebecca (madameterralupus): She might not be scared of them 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): she hates when i study there, and when i leave and come back from studying apparently
Georgia (Something Sensible): ill have to leave and come back eventually to shower
Georgia (Something Sensible): glad to know thatll upset her
Georgia (Something Sensible): my _hygiene_
Marisa (Weeb): do you have any perfume
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have febreeze ll
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay when is she leaving because dear god you can’t even BE A GOOD STUDENT
Mark (Mad Doctor): Do you have an airbrush? I think you should paint her green in her sleep
Erik (slendergiant): So my one boss did a quote for a customer a few weeks ago and we got an order for one of the assemblies, but he never took into account tooling so I'm trying to look up the tooling we need for the terminals that are on that cable and I can only find one in stock from a place that doesn't seem to service to the US?
Mark (Mad Doctor): Road trip!
Erik (slendergiant): Ok I lied, it's just not available anywhere 😑
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So my one coworker a while back took a tattoo artist internship and said she'd tattoo any of us coworkers, charging us for just the ink. I hate that I dislike needles so much and have like no pain tolerance cause oof I'd take her up on it to finally get that Humonculi tattoo I really want >.<
Jess (whoozica): oo nice, have you seen their work?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I haven't yet but then again we haven't been scheduled for the same shift for a while. Next time we work together I might ask lol
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ima be real honest, the needles are very different from like ..doctor needles. plenty of people who are afraid of needles don't mind tattoo ones, so that might not even be an issue! 
Also pain tolerance, it really just depends on wear you want it, because in most places it just feels like an annoying scratching sensation
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I've had people tell me where I want it is a good place. (The upper thigh, basically exactly where Envy has his Humonculi tattoo). A couple people have told me places with more muscle, fat "meat" on them is better and hurts less?
Marisa (Weeb): yeah the bonier the more bone hurting juice
Rebecca (madameterralupus): bone hurting juice XD
Erik (slendergiant): Update: did some testing with a tool we already had and for the most part, it'll work 👍
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I hate when stuff gets moved around my house >.>
I sold my old Ed wig and yet I can't find it to ship out D:
Jess (whoozica): oh nooo D:
Erik (slendergiant): Me: *I have a shitty boss because he often doesn't come in to work.*
Also me: *FUCK WHY IS HE HERE?*
