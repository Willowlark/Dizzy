Rebecca (madameterralupus): When you go to update your resume of what you currently do at your job and you're just like uhhh what do I do?? XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Also please wish me luck, I'm applying for the PT floral specialist position at my job.~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~ I hope I get it cause then I can get paid to be creative, and I won't be on my feet as much or doing as much heavy lifting. I'll just be stuck behind a counter making things lol~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I normally hate being a sort of like tattle tail person... but i've had the shits this week with stuff so reported my one coworker to my main boss. She was to be helping clean up the store and she barely did anything. I was behind on my closing stuff so asked her to out returns/stuff people didnt want back. She started too but then disappeared leaving cart where I left it and I couldn't find her. I later caught her walking the back aisle on the other store on the phone talking to someone.... >.> Umm I'm sorry? You couldn't wait like 10-15 more minutes??  ~~This is twice now I've caught her doing this.~~
Marisa (Mawisa): you're not having bowel issues right? that's just a figure of speech?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ~~that was my first thought too~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Shh I know I spelt it wrong. I'm tired okay lol~~
Marisa (Mawisa): nah you spelled it right
we are just concerned about your bathroom sojourns
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao.. After I typed that I figured out what ya gusy meant Shhh XDD Im so brain dead atm so im slow with catching onto things LOL
Marisa (Mawisa): hehe
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anyways, yea. I've just been really irritable this week and after finding out she wasn't doing her job and helping me and the other girl out I was pretty pissed. Like I already had enough on my hands. You couldn't wait to make your phone call, continue your job and help us other girls out like we do you?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): In short: I'm tired of working with lazy high schoolers... -.-
Marisa (Mawisa): Go all-out angry senpai on them
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol if only. Sadly I'm the same rank/position as them sooo D:
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I've been in a similar position for a very long time now, I am the only cashier who does EVERYTHING that needs to get done before leaving. Whether its in the morning or night shift I set up the person thats going to be working after me the way we're supposed to. No one else does, they'll just do whatever is convenient and then leave. So lately I've been putting my foot down and all I get back is attitude from them. Even my gm is giving me a hard time cause he's been pretty frustrated too and I'm just like ????? Sorry for being the only one who does my job, and getting angry when I have to do shift change myself while they get to leave work and hang out at home or whatever
Georgia (Something Sensible): My electromagnetism professor agreed to write a recommendation to my NASA internship!!! 👏 🚀 👏🚀👏
Mark (Mad Doctor): That's great! Good luck!
Erik (Red Riot Thot): ***Y E E T***
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Woot!! 🙌🏻🚀
