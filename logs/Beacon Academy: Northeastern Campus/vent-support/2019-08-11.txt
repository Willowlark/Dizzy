Jamie (Jamie): so question if you messaged someone who in the past hurt you in ways of heartbreak, and could be considered a cold bitch because ghosted away not once but like 3 times would you rather have them reply or not reply and continue the cold ignore method?
Anna [cadmiumcosplay /qrowbars]: Rather not reply
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I guess not reply. But also if they hurt so bad why message to begin with is what I kinda wonder? ðŸ¤”
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly I'd rather them not reply so I know for a fact they aren't really that great, and then I'd block them and never talk to them again. People like that are not worth my time personally. ESPECIALLY if they have hurt me in the past.
Jamie (Jamie): thats my wonder too xc
Jamie (Jamie): why is life putting this in front of me like i know i did terrible things let it stay in past
Jamie (Jamie): also my sis has given the great advise of the general consensus to  just not reply for, cause he might be in a low place and reaching out due to loneliness and i do not want to give the wrong idea
Jamie (Jamie): but if its a thing actually wanting to say something to me he'll message again prolly
