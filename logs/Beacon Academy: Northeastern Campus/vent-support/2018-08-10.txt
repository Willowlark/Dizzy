Erik (slendergiant): Ok kind of stupid mini-rant, but can Rooster Teeth feature more than the same 5 cosplayers? Please and thank
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ^ i'm with you on that.
Erik (slendergiant): Like, sparrowstorm is a great cosplayer, but they've featured him like a dozen times this week...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ive seen SO many amazing rtx cosplays on my dash, but rt keeps featuring the same peoples photos over and over again >.> ..maybe pick some other people too?
Georgia (Something Sensible): That big chef guy too
Georgia (Something Sensible): I wonder why they're doing it
Erik (slendergiant): YEAH
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theyre all great cosplayers, don't get me wrong, but i dont think they need to be featured several times in a row, when there were thousands of attendees
Erik (slendergiant): literally
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): seems strange. clear favoritism
Erik (slendergiant): also, I've noticed other times when they're like "Tag us to be featured!" they feature about 99% females. Like, guys cosplay too...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): you're not wrong. whoever is behind the insta account is not very good with diversity
Erik (slendergiant): There's probably several people that run it but the first that comes to mind is Barbara LOL
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): ~~barb y?~~
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): That does suck, and there were a ton of great cosplayers who prolly shoulda been featured too but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è seems a common practice. Even cosplay feature pages tend to feature the same few cosplayers. Kinda a shame
Erik (slendergiant): like all the RWBY ones? xD
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Exactly ~
Erik (slendergiant): ~~like the one that's about 75% sakura_san~~~
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): Tbh I don‚Äôt follow any so I‚Äôm not sure which one u mean, but.. yes.
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): It‚Äôs not just rwby either i see that stuff all over
jenna ( snowcappedcos ): ~~clearly we just gotta make awesome cosplays that rt can‚Äôt ignore~~
