Rebecca (madameterralupus): So random sappy post but I realized today marks one year since I broke off my engagement. I just want to say that I am ever so thankful that I immediately fell into the arms of all of you guys ❤ I’d probably be lost if I hadn’t since he at the time was all I knew aside from Matt and Jamie. Aside from the terrible break up the year following up to it was rough due to friends abandoning me and medical issues. In short I just want to say you guys are the greatest people I have ever met. You guys are true friends. So loving, fun and just an all around joy to be around. I am glad to be able to call you my friends, or even more so family ❤ ❤

Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like now I am just in a salty mood. I hate being the only one called out... Several people next to me are playing games or doing exactly what I am doing <:salt:413183845878464522> 😩
