Georgia (Something Sensible): ye its true
Georgia (Something Sensible): idk how people do it
Georgia (Something Sensible): do you meet enough new people at cons? that must always be helpful
Georgia (Something Sensible): at least at cons you already know theres things in common
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I did find one decent dude kinda through cons but idk if I'd date him.. works a lot, and seems to be too hard to meet up with outside of cons sooo *nope*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I mean this one dude I had kinda interest in I just saw is going to Zenkai so maybe I'll chat to him there and read his vibe. Maybe just left me on read cause unsure what to say after my last message? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ~~I should stop try to justify it but eh~~

Anna (loud and likely blonde): I have no idea how to wrangle a boy
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Anyways don't date frat boys unless it's a professional fraternity
Georgia (Something Sensible): even then, at least the rutgers professional fraternities are a little sketch
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Considering I pounded beers with theta tau I'm with u on that
Jess (whoozica): ~~I stalked the anime club!~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): some of the business frats have high incidences of rape at rutgers... ouch
Jess (whoozica): üò≠
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Honestly that's most college campus's.

West Chester had a sexual assult almost every week. Mainly in a dorm/frathouse/apartment between two people who knew each other. 

Granted we had a flasher on campus, but like... he came and went.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Also sorry but I have to slightly rant.

I checked my credit score, and I'm doing everything right but aparently I'm getting dinged for not spending enough?????
Erik (Red Riot Thot): We had a campus-wide Greek suspension one year because of sketchy hazing rituals
