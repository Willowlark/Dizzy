Rebecca (madameterralupus): Cosplay him in honor and memory of him ‚ù§
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Didn't they film a bunch of his future cameos all at once a while back? It's possible they've all been used by now, but maybe there's still some left? ü§∑
Mark (Mad Doctor): That would totally be my intent. I'm worried people might think it's too soon.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I'm not sure tbh. But maybe so? 
And hmm thus is possible. I'd say do it but wait a little bit then?
