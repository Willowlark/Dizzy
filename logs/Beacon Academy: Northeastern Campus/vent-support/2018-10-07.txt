Georgia (Something Sensible): My roommates texting me telling me I shouldn’t have friends over because it’s the “fourth time this week”
Georgia (Something Sensible): She counted me and a friend killing time for 10 minutes as a hang out
Georgia (Something Sensible): And she’s angry we’re all quietly watching a movie in the living room?
Georgia (Something Sensible): So the RA said if I keep having problems with her, we’re going to have to get the building coordinator involved (like, a real adult)
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You should have already.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Tbh.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Seriously she needs to chill you’re not doing anything disruptive like Jesus Christ
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah! Like it’s the same noise level as if I were watching the movie in the living room alone
Georgia (Something Sensible): And another suitemate is even watching the movie with us
Evie (Katheryne Knight): This woman needs to be yeeted out of your apartment or something. Miss princess should have gotten a apartment to herself.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like _I_ don’t need another meeting but if Sarah asks for another one I have to go, and the fact that a real adult has to get involved is nuts
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah 
But seriously she needs to be put in her place or something because this can’t keep happening.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Especially since it seems she’s singling you out
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah! And the other suitemates think she’s being ridiculous too oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): But not all of them want to get involved in the drama of course
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Of course I feel that, but the fact that they think she’s being stupid shows something
Georgia (Something Sensible): She went to bed at 9 tonight like I’m sorry it’s just not realistic to make everyone else do the same 😂
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Oof bruh...
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah it’s like sorry the world doesn’t revolve around you >_<
Like dang
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Hello,welcome to my life. You have entered the **NOFUNZONE**
Tom (tomukuncosplay): If it was a huge problem for her she'd have told you by now
Erik (slendergiant): https://media.tenor.com/images/078c9c6d79fc3dbf45e2005d65b3b4f5/tenor.gif
Marisa (Weeb): omg what did the hotel do about the wrong room
also it's time for **adult time** on that room situation
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Whomst goes to bed at 9pm on a *Saturday* other than grandparents?! Wtf XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg she must be the lightest sleeper
Georgia (Something Sensible): I keep a nightlight on so I can see my way around when I come back in after a shower
Georgia (Something Sensible): She’s been asleep 5 hours already and somehow still wakes up to ask me to turn it of
Georgia (Something Sensible): Damn
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I would be such a terrible roommate in return if I was stuck with this girl cause I'd just turn on every light to piss her off after being so fussy over 1 tiny light 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like BRUH I gotta find mah bed and it’s dark
Georgia (Something Sensible): One tiny nightlight shouldn’t keep her up
Georgia (Something Sensible): Also I suggested using an eye mask and ear plugs and she’s like... no
Georgia (Something Sensible): When I already wear an eyemask so she won’t wake ME when she gets up at the ass crack of dawn
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It seems like she's just finding any reason to complain. And wow what a bitch... I'd tell her straight up look I'm having to do a million things to adapt to *your* bullshit you can do at least one fuck thing in return.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah and honestly I don’t even think she’s that great of a student
Georgia (Something Sensible): She sleeps through classes in the morning all the time
Georgia (Something Sensible): She doesn’t have friends or any interest in dating
Georgia (Something Sensible): No hobbies no nothing
Georgia (Something Sensible): She sleeps and does programming like dats it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Geez... I'd say if she wasn't acting like an ass to you invite her to do things to get her more social but yeaaaa lol nope
Georgia (Something Sensible): _ive never seen her show any emotion except neutral or the one time she cried_
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe she's a robot XD
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg conspiracy theories, she’s a robot
Georgia (Something Sensible): And the rest of my suitemates say she didn’t interact much last year, and her old roommate was a party animal so Sarah effectively didn’t have a suitemate
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Maybe she is upset you're not a party animal and she has to share now. Lol but like tough shit. Gotta learn to deal.
Georgia (Something Sensible): YE RIGHT
Georgia (Something Sensible): I can’t even guess her hobbies from her dorm decor man
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like my side is all space and cosplay and shit lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): She’s just got a big teddy bear and a pink tapestry and some lights
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I had my own room at my apartment at berks but I still had to share bathroom/rest of the place. I hated it at times but had to deal. 
And oh wow lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah next year I hope to get a full apartment and not just a suite
Georgia (Something Sensible): There’s a rad one I’m looking at now that I can hopefully get it I find one more roommate 🙏
Georgia (Something Sensible): And they have single bedrooms connected by a kitchen, living room, and bathroom
Georgia (Something Sensible): right now I have three double bedrooms connected by a living room and bathroom
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~if my roommate ever lets me use the living room~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm that doesn't sound too bad. Especially cause you get a single room lol. I'm glad at my apartment I got the single room cause I could hibernate away if didn't wanna be social. But I was usually the only one home so mostly had it to myself 😂
And wtf? Won't let you use the living room??
Georgia (Something Sensible): Cause my roomie goes to bed at 9 apparently and says I’m too loud when I’m just watching a movie 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk this girl is crazy
Georgia (Something Sensible): If we have another RA meeting the building manager is gonna see what a whack a doodle she is
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wow that's highkey rude... she can't tell everyone what they can and can't do. It's ya'lls place too. Not just hers.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like this girl needs to get some damn sense into her head 🤔
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *beat her with the stick she’s been ramming up her ass*
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oh yea whatever happened with the big ass mango she had? She eat it or let it rot in the sun to stink up the place? 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): I guess she ate it!
Georgia (Something Sensible): I almost want to feel bad cause I came home from the gym one day and her mom was giving her a very stern talking to
Georgia (Something Sensible): But she’s a shitty person so... I don’t care lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I wouldn't considering how much of an ass she's been 🤷🏻‍♀️
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I had the same thing. My one room mate was a shitty person so I didn't care either lol.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Protect your needs... and then extend the olive branch again if you still feel bad. But you gotta throw down first to put in her place.
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH THROW DOEN
Georgia (Something Sensible): Idk I feel like I’m being a little pushy because all the other suitemates are neutral or take my side
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Going to have to become *mean* Georgia.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mean Girls AU Georgia
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You have to be pushy since Sarah is pushing you.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Mmmm she’s pushin me this is true
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I think you're fine. You're just trying to live your life as anyone would but this girl keeps finding reasons to attack you. And agreed with bill
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like okay I almost ALMOST understand the no boys allowed thing but trying to restrict my friends visiting me? That invoked the RAHE
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She’s demanding unreasonable things and you can’t start bending to that.
Georgia (Something Sensible): And the fact that she counted a friend stopping by for 20 mins as “a visit” that was pathetic
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Nor is she willing to work with you.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm. Boys I can get. But friends is a little odd. Was she that way with the other roommates??
And also her counting how many visits with friends you have is weird. Like I'm sorry?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Just get the RLC involved. With any luck they’ll quarantine the bitch.
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): She sent me this while my friends were here, and we were watching the movie with another suitemate
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I gave her a slap in text form
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): If she’s incapable of living with the basic needs of other humans, she can get stuck in a closet alone somewhere.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Y E A H like Harry Potter without the cool wizard powers
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She’s a petty and unreasonable bitch.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Y'all live there. This is bullshit.The dorm is your *home*. Y'all shouldn't be stressed there. You should be able to relax and have fun. But she's not making it that way. Does she have limits on how many times the other girls can have friends? Cause honestly this limit thing is weird to me. Like what the hell. And if she wants a complete quiet place to study there's a place called a library that she can rent a room out at 🙄 like it's never gonna be fully quiet since again.. y'all live there and gotta do shit. Tbh this girl sounds mega anal about the stupidest shit.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Well so there’s six girls here total
Georgia (Something Sensible): Me is one, Sarah is one
Georgia (Something Sensible): Two other girls Kesha and Surabhi only talk to each other and are basically neutral about everything
Georgia (Something Sensible): Kiera and Sruti are the last room and they’re super cool and friendly
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I feel like I have 3 suitemates at times lol
Georgia (Something Sensible): But yeah Sruti and Kiera are up all night laughing and she doesn’t yell at them
Georgia (Something Sensible): But god forbid my friends are here at 8:30 so she sends me a passive aggressive text lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Hmm... weird. Sounds to me like for some reason she's just singling you out which is bullshit. 
Tbh if it were me: Just live your life as you are. Stop accommodating to her so much. It's her turn to adapt others lifestyle. 🤷🏻‍♀️
And if she sends text like that again just don't reply. Act like ya never got it.
Georgia (Something Sensible): WELL it’s a group chat so that’s hard
Georgia (Something Sensible): I see your point tho
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’ll definitely keep living my best life
Georgia (Something Sensible): 👌
Rebecca (madameterralupus): She sent that in the group chat? 🙄 wooow
Marisa (Weeb): did anyone else respond to it in the group chat?
Marisa (Weeb): she's probably got guts enough to do it because she thinks the rest of the house has her back
Tom (tomukuncosplay): **Mmmshemakesmeangryyyyy**
Tom (tomukuncosplay): How do people like her exist
Mark (Mad Doctor): I'm curious what her home life is like
