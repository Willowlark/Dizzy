Anna (loud and likely blonde): I'm dead hacking so hard I feel like deflated all might rn like it's just gonna be blood next
Matt (mattmyers25): My work is closed today woohoo
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Meanwhile I‚Äôm still going in to NYC despite establishing I could work from home. <:Dab_Qrow_dab:455818767323365388>
Chris Onyx: Meanwhile i have to go in to work now instead of at 12 cause my school closed and work /never/ does
Mark (Mad Doctor): Snow day. The history department texted pictures of ourselves with beer, wine and bourbon to each other
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I can't wait until it starts snowing and then I sit in my office debating whether or not I should go home or wait it out
Jess (whoozica): Huge. Mood.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Maybe I should have stayed home... But I got a bunch of shit to get done and my desk at home is a mess of Katsu shit.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): We‚Äôll see if I regret it later...!
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): I guess I should use my airpods at work for awhile. Encourage some form of office socialness as opposite to headphones all day every day.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): My boss just called me to ask if I decide to go home early if I could work from home and honestly I feel like I'd be so much more productive lol
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): yeaaaaaah nooooo.
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): Being at home means more distractions and no chance of your boss seeing you play smash while the databases transfer.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Possibly, but is not like I'm not distracted at work to begin with
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Plus I can wear pajamas and work in bed
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): truuu but you'll feel more guilty goofing off at home.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I wouldn't work the full rest of the day at home. I just have one big quote I'd bring home and just log those hours.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Although I wouldn't even be able to finish completely because I'd need access to our intranet
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): What do y'all do about negative comments on your posts? Just block and delete the comment?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I don't usually get any, but that's probably what I'd do
Marisa (Mawisa): I just leave them unless they‚Äôre really mean and scathing. I got a long one calling me a whore and insulting my mother that I deleted, but stuff like ‚Äúur wig is wrong‚Äù or whatever I ignore
Bill üì∑ (tlt_wm): *What person wants to get cut again? Just give me a handle*
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I don't typically either, other than like pervy ones. But I got someone this morning trying to shit up the comments on an otherwise very positive comments section. I just blocked and deleted the comment cuz I didn't want the negativity
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): 
Marisa (Mawisa): Grab ur pitchforks y‚Äôall were gonna go beat up Giuseppe
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Haha. Appreciate the thoughts guys but you don't have to. I just wanted to get it off my chest.
Marisa (Mawisa): i've already contacted several hitmen
Jess (whoozica): WTF
Erik (Red Riot Thot): What is *his* bullshit
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): I mean it just seems like some edgy teen (who doesn't know how to take a selfie btw). I know I'll probably get worse in the future so I shouldn't let things bug me. But sometimes it does tick me off a bit.
Georgia (Something Sensible): I‚Äôd just delete it
Georgia (Something Sensible): People like that want attention
Georgia (Something Sensible): I delete most of mine and never see them again
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Yeah that's what I figured. No need to dwell on someone being an ass
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I've never gotten any rude comments but on my boudoir post I got a couple weird comments and I didn't reply to any of them because it would only spurs them on. That definitely goes for rude people as well. Ignoring them is your best option.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I usually laugh at them with friends and then delete them. Just trolls with no life who are not worth my time.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I haven't gotten any that I'm aware of but if I did I'd just ignore and delete if really bad.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I'm so sick right now I hate it
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I was up at 4 hacking my lungs out and like I needed to be at work tomorrow but Idk if I'll be better
Erik (Red Riot Thot): It'd be hella rad if someone would come plow our parking lot... üòí
