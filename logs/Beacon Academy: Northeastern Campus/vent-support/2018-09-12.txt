Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😢 ❤ Thank friend. Week's just been rough already and it's only Tuesday... RIP me. I wanna go back to happier stress free times
Marisa (Weeb): i have class in 3 hours and i have to finish my homework but i really want to learn how to do a split instead
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Choose the priority: learning to do a split
Marisa (Weeb): way ahead of you. as soon as i typed that i tried stretching and now everything clicks when i walk
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof 😯 sounds painful
Marisa (Weeb): *no pain no gain*
Erik (slendergiant): Finished a high priority project yesterday. Trying to figure out what I was doing before then because that was the next high priority project. Not going well. I hate it here
Evie (Katheryne Knight): So I got into a minor accident this morning. Backed into a guy while trying to avoid a bus turning a sharp turn.
He was upset at first but he saw me shaking and tearing up and he got nicer thank god. Didn’t do damage at all to my car, and very minimal to his. He didn’t press for my insurance, and said “I’ve been in your shoes it’s alright”
I was still crying afterwards and I’m glad things worked out but ugh what a way to start the day >_<
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ouch. Sometimes these things really are just accidents Gen.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I had that happen a month ago in the bridge traffic going to Armonk NY.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah I know... still I felt super bad. 
I’m just glad it was in my neighborhood and not anything serious
Jess (whoozica): awwww what a shitty morning hope it gets better from here! I would have def done the same thing ❤
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thank you 
On the plus side my co-worker brought other things for our  keurig and one of them was apple cider 
So I have some warm apple cider now
Erik (slendergiant): I need to get some apple cider... and then add a shot of Fireball to it...
Jess (whoozica): yaay!
