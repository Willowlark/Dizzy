Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): So I started working out and trying to eat better to get in shape for CCE. Anyone have any work out suggestions? Thanks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We were having a monthly work out challenge for a bit in one channel. It was kinda nice cause a couple of us did it together and we each motivated one another, helped each other out and etc. Maybe we could do one of those again ðŸ˜®
Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): Ya that would be nice.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Or even if a whole bunch of people don't want to/no one we live close enough and hang often we could do one together lol
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~Cause ya gurl fucking madddd out of shape. T_T~~
Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): I also don't really know what to say here without sound like I'm complaining
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ðŸ¤·
Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): I even ran a mile today. Working out sucks
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol yee... it does
Anna [Cyborg]: Working out is the devil but I need it
Anna [Cyborg]: I can't hold poses. I dead cant hold cosplay poses anymore 
My strength is awful
Anna [Cyborg]: Let's yell at each other for motivation
Travis (frozen waffle cosplay): Ya my goal is to be in better shape with some muscle definition by CCE
