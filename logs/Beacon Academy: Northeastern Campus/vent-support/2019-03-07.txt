Anna (loud and likely blonde): Can't tell if he trolling or. That dense.

Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel bad that my one teacher is a bit naive... she let's us listen to music coming in and some of the students take advantage of it having her play explicit stuff I don't think we shouldn't play in school, etc :\
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wow. I actually got one for once... lol.
Sorry sir, you could be my dad. Yikes
Anna (loud and likely blonde): yes you are indeed beautiful woman and are on the earth
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I could not be on Earth. I could be living on another planet ðŸ‘€ lol
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: You could also be flying 
Which would technically not be ON earth

Erik (Red Riot Thot): customers need to realize when they send us a BOM for a product to quote, we need to know what the manufacturer part numbers are... ðŸ˜‘
Erik (Red Riot Thot): so some guy from a recruiting agency keeps emailing me about an opportunity *through my work email* and I basically just ignore it. This is the 4th time he's emailed me and like, you'd think after 4 tries he should just give up?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): like, how did he even get my work email?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I was gonna say, it doesn't sound like from what you're saying you gave out your work email so how did he get it O.o
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is he from a agency you went through? Or did you not go through any?
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I only use my work email for work related things, so how he got it, I have no idea
Bill ðŸ“· (tlt_wm): Also why would you apply to a job on an email address... your company can access.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Huh yea if you only use it work for related stuff then who knows.
If you like gave it out to a previous company you applied for they could have possibly given it to the recruiting company buuuttt that's not the case. So it remains a mystery how he got it ðŸ¤·
Anna (loud and likely blonde): So apparently two years ago i started dating my 100% incredibly Italian boyfriend. On March 10th. Literally on Mar.10 on fucking mario day ARE YOU KIDDING ME. DID HE DO THIS ON PURPOSE. OR. AM I JUST THE SUBJECT OF CRUEL IRONY
