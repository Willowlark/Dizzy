Erik (Red Riot Thot): Come back into work with an RFQ from a customer for 18 assemblies 😫
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): oof, that sounds not fun
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😬 yikes there's a group of guys on the main street intersection of my school with flyers and a big ass sign saying "honk if for no abortion" or something like that...
I have mixed feelings on the matter but like big yikes...
Jess (whoozica): ah yes... a group of GUYS or course....
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right?
Jess (whoozica): they have extensive personal connection the matter much more than women, you know
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like ahh yes not a single female....they deff know more and have more of an opinion cause they of course are the ones who gotta deal with it for months and birth it... 🙄
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like I normally don't get political or debatey but oof I saw that and was like ummm... 🤔 hmmm...
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): kind of relevent but more so hilariously stupid
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i saw some old woman with a sticker on her car that said  " Don't fund planned parenthood, stop the sale of baby organs"
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i almost drove off the rode from laughing so hard
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Wtfff
Jess (whoozica): WHAT ommmffggg

Jess (whoozica): yeaaa prob a good idea
Rebecca (madameterralupus): They'd approach me and I'd probs not bite my tongue on my thoughts cause im in bitchy sleep deprived mode today 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Like what happened to it being a calm disability pride day...? Where the fuck did these guys come from?? Don't you have classes? Be gone
Jess (whoozica): oo its disability pride day? 😮
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Well for my school. Idk if it's a world wide thingy. It's an event for my school today.
Jess (whoozica): ooo ok gotcha
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Anyone else get anxiety calling out of work even when they're legitimately ill? I've been feeling absolutely dreadful since yesterday morning but it took me so long to work up the courage to call out for today.
Jess (whoozica): oh yea, everytime
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Absolutely. Usually I force myself to go cause I always get scared of what they'll say if I call off 😭
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Like I know rationally in my head, "Hey dummy you're legit sick, no one's going to be mad at you." But idk anxiety is a strange beast.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Anxiety deff is 😭
Annette (cryostasis_cosplay): Yeah, it's heck 🙃
Georgia (Something Sensible): rutgers had some people with signs saying that gays would go to hell
