Rebecca (madameterralupus): So I've been having a hard time getting into see my counselor cause of new sched with work and her sched is changing... well got a letter today from them claiming they believe I am no longer going to attend so going to close my account or whatever with them... It's been ONE month!!! Like holy shit... please don't. I want to come back it's just been difficult. Ya'll close my account or whatever it's gonna be a pain in the ass to re sign back up. I already had to do it once before for something else there... Like omg they have their shit so messed up there but I like the lady I am seeing now
