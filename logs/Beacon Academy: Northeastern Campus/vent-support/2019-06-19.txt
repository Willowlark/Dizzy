Jamie (Jamie): trying to write a journal thing for swedish massage class. talking about the tripod concept of beingness that includes Honesty, Awareness, and compassion and writing what they are and why its valuable in a massage therapy session. not a hard thing to write but doing like a good paragraph if not more on it without saying basicness is a time
Jamie (Jamie): i finished it but also now wondering if because i didnt describe what the three things mean if that will cost me points cause fuck
Jamie (Jamie): "What are the three components of Tripod? Why is working from the tripod valuable in a massage therapy session?" is the prompt so i think im okay not explaining what each literally mean
Anna [Cyborg]: you should be fine
Jamie (Jamie): it's put away now i will find out someday if i did good or not lol
Jamie (Jamie): now should probs eat some foods got a little under 2 hours before need to leave for class lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): I tell my students that they're writing for "a well read idiot". Assume I've read the textbook, but I have no clue what your ideas are, so explain them to me clearly and in simple steps
