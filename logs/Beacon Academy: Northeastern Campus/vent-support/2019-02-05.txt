Rebecca (madameterralupus): So my cousins wife asked my mom the other night for she could send their daughter here to live for a month for some reason... we denied for several reasons but my mom saw her one photo on Facebook and goes idk but if I said yes she could stay here she'd be going through the Beth Bitch Boot camp... she needs to cut this sexy duck face stuff out. She's only 13! 
I lost it at her "boot camp" name though LOL
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Vic got the boot
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He's no longer voicing Qrow
Rebecca (madameterralupus): RIP Qrow.
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I saw your tweet at RT earlier about Chris lol
Mark (Mad Doctor): I thought the drink would be what took him down
Georgia (Something Sensible): so theyre gonna recast oooo
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We all are voting Chris be new Qrow
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Please don't kill off Qrow like this is all I ask
Anna (loud and likely blonde): I am. Glad I never got him to sign my rwby poster lmfao
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I'm confident they will get someone good to voice him.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Like. Hundreds of fans would line up to try out for him. They're not a tiny studio.
Anna (loud and likely blonde): Also like how much money they gonna save not paying him lmfao
Jamie (Jamie): I'm honestly mixed feelings on the while thing like yea no what he did not good makes him pretty scummy but also he had been the only VA i had any interest in meeting because his singing voice makes me go yis
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaa I've heard or seen a few comments about how he acted this way through out the years some but only here and there. Not as brought up as much as now. I've met him like 2-3 times and never had a bad experience so I didn't have any dislike towards him. He was always really friendly, sweet and fun to talk to when I met him. No acting in any sort from what I've been seeing lately. This kinda sucks cause he was always one of my fave VA's but if he's been acting this way then what can ya do ü§∑ He did wrong soo...
Jamie (Jamie): Yea pretty much, though i did hear a story from my one nc friend said that he was really pushy about religion during a panel she went to of his that was Christianity in anime or something like that
Jamie (Jamie): So having a mental break as i finally look at my w2 from my work and realize if I did a full year of working there I would barely make 6-8k.... I wanna cry
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is this the current job?
Anna (loud and likely blonde): ~~this fuckin engineer who left the company issued plans with the stop bar on the wrong side of the road~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): It's amazing how I can be so organized when it comes to my cosplays and crafting supplies... but anything else... nope! ~~Goal for this year. Get better at organization again~~
