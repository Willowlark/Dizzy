Jamie (Jamie): Fates have mercy this is a thing that actually heard today in line for a ride
Jamie (Jamie): "a 13 yr old girl tell a same age boy "you look so daddy right now" "
Matt (mattmyers25): Ummm
Tom (tomukuncosplay): NOOOOOO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I have decided my body hates me completely -.-;
So I've had foot problems as long as I can remember. Like when I am walking a lot or standing a lot, my feet absolutely kill me from achey-ness to the point I constantly have to stop and has caused me to cry from the pain 😫  Well we went to another foot doctor to day to see what they say about it... after they took some x-rays, turns out I have a stress fracture in both feet on the bones behind my 2nd and 3rd toe next to big toe... 
I was told since the muscles and stuff in my foot are so tight I currently have to wear orthodics in my shoes, wear a splint at night to stretch it and do physical therapy.... on top of all of that... I'm most likely going to have to have surgery in the future to fix these fractures 😭 
Can my body for once not hate me and just function properly?? -.-'
Jess (whoozica): Oh no! 😭  awww im sorry hun
Erik (slendergiant): Oof I'm so sorry 😦
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Is okay I guess, just hoping I end up not needing to do said surgery but it's like 99% I am D:
If I do I hope it's not as bad as I am making it out to be in my head cause oof having legs/feet casted, using crutches and thinking about the recovery seems like it wouldn't be a fun time and just high key frustrating
Jess (whoozica): yea especially cuz you basically just got over another surgery 😭
jenna: Nooo Rebecca D: I really hope it isn’t too bad
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Definitely, and I am still technically in recovery from that still D: 
And mhmmm I hope it isnt either >.< We haven't even confirmed it yet and I'm already dreading the recovery...
jenna: Try not to stress yourself out too much 💕 gotta take one day at a time
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Tis what I am doing. Hoping if I do these first 3 things it helps it and the doctor turns around and says I can live without the surgery...
And even if I do have to have the surgery I know it won't be for a while.
Jess (whoozica): thats basically my attitude  with my TMJ they're like "you might need jaw surgery someday" and im like "someday is not today"
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Mhmm very true haha. 
On the plus side... found out what the hell is wrong with my feet after over 12 years and 5 foot doctors >.< Hoping all this ish works and I can get rid of this achy pain I always ahve
Jess (whoozica): 😱
Jess (whoozica): omg well at least you have a diagnosis now
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Haha definitely.I'm like finally some answers that make some damn sense XD
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Funny enough thouggh: One doctor years ago did say we needed to do surgery and my mom was like oh hell no.... welp SURPRISE!
Jess (whoozica): oof, yea actually figuring out whats wrong can be comforting even if the treatment is scary
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): this might be first world problem-y, but being a young "boss" is so aggravating because no one listens to me and I end up having to do 3 positions worth of work on the regular. 
i want to kill the employees here today. I've asked the same 4 - 5 guys that work in the back warehouse multiple times since 9am this morning to check in a pallet for me while i got a ton of other shit done in the office. I just went back there to grab the scaning gun bak so i could use it on my other work, no one has touched the pallet i asked them to do. it's now 3:30pm and i asked them to do it at 9am..... it shouldve only took 30mins TOPS. and theyre all just fucking around back there cracking jokes and not doing any work at all. 

im so annoyed right now LMAO.
Plus the AC isnt working so the heat just adds to it. HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGfjdhgjlhfasd
Erik (slendergiant): Very valid problem. I'm sorry people suck
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > move Pallet into sun
> move car in front of theirs in the lot
> drop clipboard of stuff they need to do in front of them 
> “Now you can unload it AND get a tan.”
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): tempting, VERY tempting
Jess (whoozica): walk back there, put your hands on your hips, and yell "get to work you lazy fuckers"
Erik (slendergiant): Bill, your passive-aggressive shoulder angel
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): I BASICALLY DID LMAO\
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): i went back there like
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): "so is this getting done today???
Jess (whoozica): YOU TELL EM
Erik (slendergiant): And Jess, the straight-forward-no-fuck-given shoulder devil
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Is it passive if you’re actively holding them hostage till they do it?
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but of course  im sure it wont because these god damn assholes don't listen to me ever
Jess (whoozica): 😭
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): : 'D
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *Unleash the bees into the back room, lock the door*
Erik (slendergiant): https://giphy.com/gifs/season-3-the-simpsons-3x11-l2Je42RdFWNA0AgJW
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): LMAO
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I feel that. I used to work with people like that when I was at Dutch -.- 
I would tell them again to do it and if they don't fucking write them up for not doing them up for not doin what you (the boss) said to do.  Sorry I'm a dick and not nice when people don't do their jobs, espec when it's a simple task lol. Are they younger or older??
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): we sell bee keeper stuff here 🤔
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): theyre younger, but not by much
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): but i work with a bunch of redneck assholes who think women are inferior >.> LMaOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO jkhslafhfkl
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): so any time i speak to them theyre kinda just like "eh whatever"
Erik (slendergiant): And, as bad as it sounds, the fact that you're a woman probably doesn't help either 😒
Jess (whoozica): ~~see i was gonna mention that might be a factor but i didnt wanna assume~~
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): and i swear to god im gonna go back there and just start yelling
Jess (whoozica): GIVE EM HELL
Jess (whoozica): FUCK EM UP
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): IM GONNA FITE

Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): thats actually a good one, i might use that
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Snark aside, if he out right mouthed off to your face, particularly in defiance of doing work, that's a justification.
Leanna (Lipstickgiraffe): it sure is, and there were witnesses so this kids about to get fucking destroyed today. it's too hot in here to deal with this
Jess (whoozica): go go go go go
