Marisa (Weeb): underclassmen get a 4 day weekend while we have to go to school on thanksgiving and respect for the elderly day
they literally had to send us an e-mail saying "the entire building will be closed and no one aside from your class will be in the building but you still have class. You can get to the classroom by going to the security booth, showing them your student ID, and asking them to take you to the third floor because otherwise everything will be locked, you won't be able to get inside, and you can't use the elevators." thanks.
Matt (mattmyers25): That sucks
Marisa (Weeb): I feel bad for the security guard. We have like 30 people he‚Äôs gonna be making a lot of trips
Matt (mattmyers25): True. Also, this may be the 1 time where you wish the guard didnt get the memo about class happening. Doubt that would happen
Marisa (Weeb): Yeah omg ‚Äúthe buildings closed today. Go home.‚Äù
He‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwhy are all these foreigners talking to me today I‚Äôm just supposed to guard the building. are they lost tourists‚Äù
