Rebecca (madameterralupus): I need to remember to not wear red when I go to target .-.
you want fucking rwby chibi?: did you get mistaken for an employee?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yuuppp
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Doesn't matter. I got mistaken for a micheals employee, while wearing blue jeans and a blue sweatshirt.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): -~~ happened to me once in the summer too.. but I was wearing my scrub top that was black??~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~The sign is in red dumbass, of course I don't work here~~
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lmao. I think it's just old people, they see a young person and are like oh of course you work here! XD
you want fucking rwby chibi?: yeahhh. if youre wearing red, especially red and khaki, you Will be mistaken for a target employee no matter what
you want fucking rwby chibi?: its ingrained in the customers' heads that red(+khaki)=employee
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This time the lady thinking I wrk there was valid cause my red sweatshirt. But like the one time I was wearing my black scrubs?? What? XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I get mistaken for a joanns employee constantly. (I did used to work their so maybe ppl recognize me) but like I wasn’t even wearing green!!
you want fucking rwby chibi?: target customers are their own breed,
you want fucking rwby chibi?: actually thats true for all stores really
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol I mean one time while working some lady asked if we were Michaels... ahh yes... the AC Moore on my apron is actually a code name for michales didn't you know. People are strange lol
Jess (whoozica): that happneed to me at walmart, someone asked where something was and i was like "uhhh i dont work here, but i think i know where it is"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): One of my fav memories from working at joanns was one night I was leaving to go on my 15min break, I had my jacket on over my apron was holding my phone, wallet and keys and some women carrying a bunch of fabric came up to me and asked if I worked their. It had been a LONG day and I was on my break and had less then 15min to get across the street to Starbucks pick up my coffee and head back to the store. Without breaking pace or even making eye contact with this women I said NOPE and continued to walk out of the store. One of the assistant managers was right behind me and saw the whole thing and as I was exiting the store I heard her break out laughing at what I assumed was an incredulous expression on this customers face.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): This AM also hated working at joanns so she thought he situation was HILARIOUS and commended me on not breaking my stride 😂
Rebecca (madameterralupus): XDD right Jess?? 
And lmao that's great Meg. Honestly I'd do the same...
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I was NOT wasting my break on what was most likely a stupid question 😂
Jess (whoozica): "do you work here"
"not for the next 15 mins i dont"
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): EXACTLY
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Although I'm too nice sometimes and help people even when not clocked in :/ (usually on break I just hide in the back so don't get it ruined lol)
Jess (whoozica): honestly people are so rude though? like if u see someone with a jacket on and carryinf a purse, wallet, phone you dont ask them SHIT imo
Jess (whoozica): like they are not on the clock obviously stop being an ass
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): like if I was on the clock, I wouldn’t have cared, go ahead waste my time. I’ll do it with a smile and hold your hand while I explain everything. But if I’m on my precious break?? You got another thing coming
Jess (whoozica): exactly
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Right?! 
I'll have people ask me and then they notice I'm like got shit in my hands or etc and are like oh no I'm sorry you're not in yet. But usually I'm nice and help quick anyways ooorrr find a coworker that is in that can help them lol
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): There was a time I was doing a trash run in framing, I had a box of BROKEN GLASS under one arm and was dragging a giant box of folded up cardboard boxes and some lady had the audacity to come up to me and ask me to carry her fabric to the cutting counter because she “couldn’t hold it” 
1. WITH WHAT HAND do you want me to do this. I’ll just shove this stuff in my ass to carry your two bolts of fabric 
2. GET A FUCKING SHOPPING CART THATS WHAT THEYRE THERE FOR
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeaaa we have people like that at my job too -.-
Matt (mattmyers25): Remember that it s common sense
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): It ain’t common that’s for sure
Matt (mattmyers25): Some people dont have it
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Lol last week I came in and half of our shopping carts weren't in the thingy outside so I was like where did they go, it doesn't seem that busy? Turns out my boss was irritated people weren't putting them away and hogging up the entryway with them or just leaving them all over the store empty so she took like over half of them away to the back XD
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Good
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We also constantly have people complain that the carts won't fit in  the aisles... well im sorry the cart that isn't for "our" store won't fit...  Don't know what to tell ya there 🙄
Georgia (Something Sensible): Honestly despite the old people who like to shit on me because they’re old and almost dying, I think I have a pretty decent work ethic
Georgia (Something Sensible): Like I’ve skipped on breaks to help customers, but my family name is also... on the building... so I have more invested than the average employee
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): I wouldn’t say I have a bad work ethic, when I’m on the clock i will literally be the most helpful person I can and will bend over backwards for the ungrateful shit head customers if need be and I’ll do it with a smile worthy of kirishima Eijirou. But the second I’m off the clock? Sorry I did my time, pls find someone else. Ive worked in some form of the service industry every year since I was 16yrs old, my will to genuinely want to help ppl died LONG ago. I’ve seen the worst of humanity in all of its forms. I’ve worked in fast food, clothing retail, regular retail and food service. Yes I have seen ppl do some genuinely great things for strangers but I’ve also been treated like actual dirt by 85% of the customers I’ve worked with. I just don’t see a lot of good in ppl I don’t know any more, working in the jobs I’ve had have made me a very cynical person and I just don’t give a fuck about themanymore
Jess (whoozica): yea dealing with people in retail and food service type setting is whole different ball park.
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Honestly working as a server/bartender for three years is what did me in. Yeah I made a butt fuck ton on money in that time frame but I also felt like a piece of my soul died every day I went into work
Jamie (Jamie): Yeaaa there are reasons I refuse to go back to working fast food or food service jobs *even if they would pay more some of them* I got just done with the customer and hell the coworkers too by the time I was done at Wendy's
Halim (Greg) (jake): I just stood up from a chair in the student center at my school 
About halfway through standing I hit my head on q hanging light 
Why are there lights hanging lower than six feet above chairs
Georgia (Something Sensible): ~~because most people are not actual ents from lord of the rings~~
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): Boo hoo I’m tall, I can reach things on the top shelf
meghan (thefantasylovingredhead): My life is SO HARD
Matt (mattmyers25): I have stories from when I worked in food service.  But for now, sports parents are the worst
Marisa (Weeb): did anybody see you
if no one saw it didn't happen
if someone saw you're now the ent guy
Halim (Greg) (jake): Several people heard me and saw me
Marisa (Weeb): haha nice going ent guy
Halim (Greg) (jake): These lights are at like the 5'6 level
Georgia (Something Sensible): ENT GUY 👏 ENT GUY 👏
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): > Buys a sky writer
> sends them over UD
> writes "Halim the ent guy"
Marisa (Weeb): who's halim
Erik (Red Riot Thot): I feel your pain Hal. You're not alone
Marisa (Weeb): do you mean greg
Jess (whoozica): meanwhile here i am climing on top of my cabinets to reach cans in the corner "why did they put these shelves so damn high"
Georgia (Something Sensible): We’re just adding nicknames to Hal’s username until t takes up the whole screen aren’t we
Marisa (Weeb): why are you calling greg hal
Erik (Red Riot Thot): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): I thought he was jake
Georgia (Something Sensible): Jake with the hats
Marisa (Weeb): from state farm
Marisa (Weeb): tldr ent guy
Halim (Greg) (jake): Erik your the only one who gets me 😭😭
Rebecca (madameterralupus): > need to go talk to my advisor at 2pm
> also kinda just want to take a nap instead between counseling and Chiro...
Georgia (Something Sensible): Academic advisor?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yeee
Jamie (Jamie): So pretty sure i ha e been ghosted by a company for a job interview
Jamie (Jamie): Like i did a phone call with this woman who in the same call set the interview up and then 2 days later i got a message to reschedule said interview and no responde since like damn I have tried everything to get ahold of her again? While staying professional? Only thing left is call the company directly to talk to anyone in HR
Jamie (Jamie): Like if you dont want to hire me because reasons at least be honest and tell me. This aint tinder ya know
Matt (mattmyers25): And then company's get mad when candidates ghost them
Jess (whoozica): I'd say give them call
Matt (mattmyers25): 
Jamie (Jamie): I have been though and texting and emailing? Like properly responding to them and now reaching out. Today direct line called the lady I was talking to. Honestly i might not even wait til end of work to try calling the company HR instead
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I mean, if they’re playing games make em spit it out before you give up, and if they aren’t contacting them shows your motivation.
Jamie (Jamie): Thats what im hoping for if i can ever get them to speak to me again lmao this really feels like a weird almost dated thing like wtf
Jamie (Jamie): How are fast food more proffesional in this lmao
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Fast corps give a series of steps everyone follows. Impersonal and routine.
Jamie (Jamie): I mean true and they tend to call interview hire within 2-3 days so
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Everything is automated with corporations like that. People don't see your resume until a few steps in, computers scan for keywords.
Jamie (Jamie): That honestly makes sense lol
Jamie (Jamie): Maybe thats why they ghosted realized I never did college or worked in an office yet
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I thought this was a small company?
Jess (whoozica): dont think she ever mentioned size
Jamie (Jamie): Not the one trying to get into. But the position is just an office assistant. Its a company the is middle man for drug testing rather large i think
Jamie (Jamie): Current job is super tiny company 4 people here lol
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): that's not quite what I'm talking about though. My statements are for the chain stores, Staples, Mcdonalds, etc.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Definitely hound them a bit.
Jamie (Jamie): Ahh then still back to the fact regular company ghosting me it seems lol
Jamie (Jamie): And thats the plan since the interview was supposed to be tomorrow -v-;
Erik (Red Riot Thot): *Maybe they'll email you confirming your interview while you're driving to the interview*
Mark (Mad Doctor): Ugh. My dog had a stroke last night. She's probably going to be ok, but every time she tries to walk she falls over.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 😭 Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that Mark. That's so sad. I hope she'll be okay and recover soon.
Mark (Mad Doctor): Given some of the alternatives that could have been the cause of her symptoms, we got lucky. Apparently dogs don't really need all their brain cells
Jess (whoozica): Awww poor doggo! 😭 If she continues having trouble getting up, they make these little rubber booties you can get at the pet store that can help them grip better
Mark (Mad Doctor): She looks embarrassed to be in this photo with me...
Rebecca (madameterralupus): She's like daaaaddd I just wanna nap, why you taking selfies with me 😝
