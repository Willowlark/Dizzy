Jamie (Jamie): So when i finish school high chance i'll be moving up to northern Pocono area for a work opportunity. And finally talked to jason about my thinking about it and he said go for it like its a good opportunity and he supports my wanting to do it. So I'm happy and dont feel guilty for wanting to do that now.
