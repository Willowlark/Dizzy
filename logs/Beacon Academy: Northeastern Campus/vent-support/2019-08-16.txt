Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yup... I think it's time I remove my aunt from facebook. I'm getting tired of her comments without thinking.
Like she shared a post with me earlier today on weighted blankets trying to be helpful. Okay cool. And then my other aunt just asks if she (the first aunt) has ever used one. To which she basically goes no, why do I need one? Im not posting about feeling depressed and having anxiety....Like idk. Just the way I read/took it kind hurt me. Like she's tired of seeing my posts on that. And like sure I share posts like that but uhh not all the time. Like it's not all I post about/my entire being. I am mostly happy... like wtf
idk I love my family but goooodd my moms side pisses me off. Never think before they comment/say shit, gossip, sticking their noses where it shouldnt be... ugh
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): time to slap her with a heavy weighted blanket
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Honestly... tempted.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): This is just one of many things. She's always commenting shit thats dumb that strikes a nerve with me. Like yes... I have mental health issues. Like im sorry?? I have her blocked from most cause tired of this shit but few miss.. Just so tired of it
Marisa (KaseiCosplay): smack her with two weighted blankets
Rebecca (madameterralupus): ~~lmao again.. tempted~~
