Georgia (Something Sensible): Yall the sciences are a trip because I had shitty lab partners for two classes in a row
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I never realized how easy those lab classes can be when you have a GOOD lab partner
Georgia (Something Sensible): like my lab partner today was like "hey when you get a chance, lets cross check our data, ill send you an excel spreadsheet of my work"
Georgia (Something Sensible): _thats the best communication any lab partner has had with me_ 😭 🙏
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeeee keep them close.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Good partners are worth their weight in gold.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Part 582 of my roommate woes: so she can’t sleep with ANY light in the room
Georgia (Something Sensible): I can’t even watch Netflix with headphones in
Jess (whoozica): WHAT omgggg
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I leave a small night light on while I leave to shower
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Good grief. She sounds like an extreme nuisance.
Georgia (Something Sensible): So I can find my way through the room
Georgia (Something Sensible): I’m gone 10 mins, she turns it off
Georgia (Something Sensible): I get back, and have to stumble through the room to get back to turn it on
Rebecca (madameterralupus): She can't fucking cover her head up with a blanket or face away from the light? Not that damn hard...
Georgia (Something Sensible): She doesn’t use an eye mask or ear plugs
Georgia (Something Sensible): Everyone had to bend to her will oof
Georgia (Something Sensible): Anyways so I’m creepin through my own room to get to the nightlight
Georgia (Something Sensible): And I TRIP on my own backpack
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): I would be beyond done at this point, tell her that you have the right to watch something while she sleeps and that you also have the right to see when exiting the bathroom. Tell her to take the stick out of her ass and deal with it.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Hit the floor, she doesn’t even stir
Georgia (Something Sensible): 
Georgia (Something Sensible): That’s me
Georgia (Something Sensible): BUT THEN THE BEST PART
Georgia (Something Sensible): I turn on the LIGHT
Georgia (Something Sensible): And sheS LIKE CAN YOU TURN THAT OFF
Jess (whoozica): OMG
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's ridiculous. Everyone shouldn't have to bend to her will. She needs to learn to adapt and make changes too. Part of living with people.  
And oof. I would have been an ass and rang my wet hair on her after that comment 😂
Georgia (Something Sensible): She’s wild I didn’t know these kinds of people exist
Rebecca (madameterralupus): I thought I had bad roommates when I was at Berks...but oof... this girl sounds just horrendous...
Georgia (Something Sensible): She sleeps at 10:30 every night too
Georgia (Something Sensible): The other girls and I are up til 12-2 ish
Rebecca (madameterralupus): As most normal college students are lol.
Georgia (Something Sensible): She can’t expect us to be dead silent
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Yea deff not. Like most college students are up late. And party. I dealt with a lot of nights having to drown out my roommate and her friends partying, drinking and etc when I had an 8am class. They tried to be quiet but ya know she lived there too and I couldn't tell her what to fully do. So I had to adapt to it.  This girl needs to learn how to do that too
Heather (batgoddesscosplay): We can always recuse you <@245270932602486784>
Marisa (Weeb): do you at least get along with the others? or are they all rough n tough
Marisa (Weeb): I was invited to be an on-stage guest at a big anime festival in Saitama. But the venue is directly outside the exact same government building where I worked for a month <:lenny:456549338026344489>
I want to accept but I know that any coworkers/students/clients that I had might recognize me ~~especially the one dude who was like “hey are you a cosplayer”~~
What do. Also someone has something fruity that smells delicious in this computer lab and I want some.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Buy the bitch an eye mask Georgia.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And if she complains, tell her she’s impacting your studying and college is supposed to be a place of study.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): The same crap she said about having friends over.
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH
Georgia (Something Sensible): like id understand if she tried an eyemask and earplugs and that didnt work
Georgia (Something Sensible): but shes not even trying
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She doesn’t own the apartment and you should suffer cause she thinks she does.
Marisa (Weeb): The other girls were her old room mates right? Do you get along with them? Do you know if this is how she’s always been
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You can call her bluff and do you own shit and ignore her; if she wants to play “my mom says” you can do the same back or remind her she’s in college and Mommy has no say; or you go back the RA and say “you and I both know this wasn’t a fair deal. What else can we do”. The latter which will like be either escalate to the RLC, or someone gets put on a list for a new room. Which should be her for a single, because she’s unfit for other human beings.
Marisa (Weeb): if you get along with your other roommates do you know how they handled previously rooming with her? did they try and talk with her about it, or did they just comply? were there any previous issues between her and them? i think you mentioned they were all good friends right?
Marisa (Weeb): your room mate's mindset might be that she's doing everything good and properly and you're the heathen with male friends who stays up too late and. idk eats macaroni or something. she might not understand other people's perspectives that these things can be good too. you've probably already done this but try to tell her that you've been bending over backwards trying to adapt to her unique lifestyle but that just isn't how other people live and that it's causing you major problems, so you want to compromise.

if that doesn't/hasn't worked then start maliciously complying.
Marisa (Weeb): you said you tripped in the dark. start *accidentally* knocking everything down and making a ruckus.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She did that. it ended up in the RA's office for mediation because stick-up-her-butt doesn't understand the meaning of compromise.
Erik (slendergiant): I say at this point just live our dorm life as if she's not there and don't give a heck about having lights on or your laptop going
Marisa (Weeb): start demanding ridiculous things from her
Marisa (Weeb): "i can only sleep when the room is permeated with the smell of cinnamon and there is a hard boiled egg in **every** corner of the room that must be replaced every 6 hours. the time they were boilled will be written on them so i will know if they haven't been changed. I'll have to reach over you while you sleep to replace the eggs.'
Marisa (Weeb): "also i'm doing calisthenics at 3AM now and my workout routine is done to classical slam poetry on casette tape"
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~it's a good thing you commuted~~
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Though didn't you live on campus as freshman?
Marisa (Weeb): start adding "nya" at the end of everything you say to your room mate
Marisa (Weeb): georgia try introducing her to homestuck. get real into it again. hang up some posters of gamzee.
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH HOMESTUCK WILL SAVE THE DAY
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah idk when the RA suggested that she change HER lifestyle to accommodate mine a bit, Sarah got all confused and was like “why should I have to do that”
Evie (Katheryne Knight): OOF
Erik (slendergiant): *"Wait... People have other lifestyles than mine?"* 🤔
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So that's why you go back to the RA and say "this girl, huge stick, in her ass. What do."
Erik (slendergiant): https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/021/464/14608107_1180665285312703_1558693314_n.jpg
Jess (whoozica): wait people who do things differently aren't evil?
Georgia (Something Sensible): NANI that’s crazy talk
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like wow she’s...hella selfish
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Like...nani the fuck is this bullshit
Evie (Katheryne Knight): “How DARE you suggest I change myself for someone else’s life style!”
*makes you change your life style for hers*
Evie (Katheryne Knight): ^^Your roommate
Georgia (Something Sensible): My roommate would never look that adorable
Georgia (Something Sensible): LMAO
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Okay true
Georgia (Something Sensible): Omg man I kicked the door open and dropped my bad cause I’m wiped from the gym
Georgia (Something Sensible): Sarah and her mom were apparently having a serious discussion
Georgia (Something Sensible): It’s in Chinese so I don’t know what she’s saying?
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Probably about proper ass stick maintenance.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Her mom already thinks I’m a bad influence and a whore probably so
Georgia (Something Sensible): Guess I’m playing videogames in the living room whooppeeeeee
Evie (Katheryne Knight): God I’m sorry
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And she’s a prude wrapped around her mother’s finger.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): You don’t have to be friends, just live together.
Georgia (Something Sensible): TRUE FACTS we have a check in meeting at 11 tonight too
Georgia (Something Sensible): We’re one of the problem suites apparently
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~not that bitch on wheels understand\ that concept~~
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~isn’t that past her bed time~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): YEAH THAts the best part
Georgia (Something Sensible): But that’s when the RA said we had to do it owo
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): ~~she could get pregert if she stays up in the devils hours~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): True facts if you stay up past 11 you run the risk of pregnancy
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): RA sounds like she’s on your side, should talk to her on your own.
Georgia (Something Sensible): Yeah I mean the friend thing is okay, I’m wondering if it’s worth it to bring up the fact that she refuses to get an eye mask or earplugs
Georgia (Something Sensible): And just wants to kick me out instead
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): She’s not even being nice about it right?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Talk to the RA privately. Find out your options. Sarah clearly needs to be quarantined to a closet somewhere.
