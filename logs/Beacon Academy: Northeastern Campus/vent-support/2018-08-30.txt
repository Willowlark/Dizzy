Evie (Katheryne Knight): So...my co-worker just...quit
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He just kinda gave a letter of resignation to my boss and left
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): dick move.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Which is odd because he was fine 3 days ago...so I’m worried 
Apparently there’s a lot going on in his personal life that it’s physically upsetting him to the point of quitting
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m wondering if his wife filed for divorce
Evie (Katheryne Knight): It’s just all odd and it literally happened 3 minutes ago and I’m worried for him
Evie (Katheryne Knight): He was the only nerd I could talk to.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Oof that really sucks. I am sorry to hear that. I hope things don't get too stressful for you at work now... Also hope everything is okay in his life if things are not great right now for him :\
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Thank you.
It’s gonna be rough because he was trained to be on desk and teller so Saturdays are going to be hell now
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Im hoping I can pull through >_<
Rebecca (madameterralupus): You got this girl! Stay strong~ ❤ 💪
Evie (Katheryne Knight): I’m trying! I’m still getting help on Saturday but the person they are bringing in will probably be primarily on desk side
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And tomorrow is going to be crazy because it’s the first of the month
Matt (mattmyers25): So I just got made fun of by my boss, in front of a co-worker, for not being able to tie balloons and decorating correctly. He joked about writing me up
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I take it he's not the kind of boss you joke with.
Matt (mattmyers25): No. He told me to get an Asian gf because they are submissive
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): So he's a dick, got it.
Erik (slendergiant): Pretty sure you can report that...
Erik (slendergiant): that's a 100% racist remark
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): and sexist.
Erik (slendergiant): ^
Matt (mattmyers25): My hrs department wont do shit
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I don't doubt it, honestly.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And I wouldn't want to work with the guy after filing a complaint, so unless he gets canned or you get a transfer(?), it's just not worth the risk...
Erik (slendergiant): wait, what's HR again? 🙄
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): We've got one now!
Matt (mattmyers25): Them he made a comment about getting an hr form when i have been written up already
Rebecca (madameterralupus): <@!155492347122155520> do I need to drive up there and beat the shit out of yo boss?! 😡 WHAT A DICK
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Deff start working on applying to other places like ASAP...
Erik (slendergiant): So I got 5 letters in the mail today from different lawyers because I got pulled over and ticketed coming home from Ethan's this weekend...
Erik (slendergiant): Like, is that normal?
Rebecca (madameterralupus): 🤷🏻‍♀️ can't help ya there. I've never gotten pulled over. -knocks on wood-
Rebecca (madameterralupus): What did you get pulled over for?? O.o
Erik (slendergiant): Speeding but he let me off with careless driving
Mark (Mad Doctor): I've never gotten lawyers contacting me, but maybe they know I'm a lost cause.  What state did it happen in?
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): It happened to my sister.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): I haven't gotten a speeding ticket.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): No one comment, people who drive with me.
Erik (slendergiant): NJ
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Where?
Mark (Mad Doctor): https://www.quora.com/My-sister-got-a-speeding-ticket-and-she-keeps-getting-letters-from-attorneys-in-the-mail-should-she-respond
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Either way, I'm assuming as Ethan is involved there was a beer or or two involved, so bless he didn't try and slap you with an (unwarranted) drinking and driving charge.
Erik (slendergiant): Watchung
Erik (slendergiant): I hadn't been drinking
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): *I of course, assume you wouldn't really drinks and drive as you're a smart boi*
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Ah, point is moot then.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): That's further west than I thought.
Erik (slendergiant): He said I was doing 37 in a 25 but since I was close to 20 over (because apparently 12 is close to 20?) he let me off with careless driving so I'd only get 2 points and not have to appear in court since I was 2 hours from home
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Reckless would be a pain in the ass, small favors.
Erik (slendergiant): And thanks <@386567060026556417> that makes sense
Matt (mattmyers25): Nah <@169297844874903552> ill vet Michell to do that
Rebecca (madameterralupus): We can both do it xD the more the better lol
Matt (mattmyers25): Oh boy lol
