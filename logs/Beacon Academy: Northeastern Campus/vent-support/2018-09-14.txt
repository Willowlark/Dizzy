Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Man I hate fasting blood work. I’m a breakfast person.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): And there’s a freaking screaming child.
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Update on my computer: they were able to get it fixed and it's coming back to me today! 🙏🏻
Monica (absolutezerocosplay): 🙏
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So i dropped q class before the free drop/add period at UD ended
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): But for some reasom I'm still registared and paying for it
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So i email my advisor, they tell me to gi to the registar office off of academy street
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I have been sent to 3 different buildings trying to find this stupid office since
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I have been sent to 3 different buildings trying to find this stupid office since
Tom (tomukuncosplay): 🤔
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): And now I'm told that no matter what I do theyre gonna charge  me
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So now the class i didnt go to for the past week I have to pay for no matter what
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So my only choices are to fill out a withdraw form and pay for it or take the class
Jess (whoozica): but you put in for the drop before the free drop period was up?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Yeah but it apparentky didnt registar on the system
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Cause I did it this weekend (which has never been a problem before) 
But they dont have an online record for it for whatever reason
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): So I'm fucked
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Worst part is it was a language class 
Catchung up 4 missed classes is a bitch qnd a half 
Especially since its arabic
Jess (whoozica): and you have to pay the full cost?
Jess (whoozica): even withdrawing so early?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Idk how much exactly but its still expensive and I shouldnt have to pay
Georgia (Something Sensible): sick your mom on them, shes a powerful lady
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Im gonna talk to my arabic teacher to see if qe can work out some catch up and maybe not have the absences count as badly against me
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): And my mom would just push me to take arabic harder at this point 😓 😓
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Theyre obsessed with the idra of me takinh arabic
Jess (whoozica): yea maybe you can explain what happened  and the teacher will cut you some slack at least?
Jess (whoozica): how many classes did you miss?
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): 4
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): Every day this week
Jess (whoozica): ~~holy buts is it normal at real college to have a class that often? i only went to community max was three a week i think~~
Georgia (Something Sensible): depends on the length of time they meet and the credit load
Georgia (Something Sensible): a lot of languages are 4 credits which usually corresponds to 4 hours
Georgia (Something Sensible): i have a 3 hour lab+1 hour lecture thats a 4 credit load
Georgia (Something Sensible): anyways, UD is totally screwing you, i feel like you should be able to complain your way up the heirarchy to get a refund and let you drop the class
Georgia (Something Sensible): thats the point of the add/drop period
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Yeah, if they fucked up the paperwork that’s on them.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Don’t take their shit.
Bill 📷 (tlt_wm): Registrar is run by a bunch of imbeciles at every college.
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I'll  try 
At least my teacher is super nice
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I just talked to him and hes like "theyre stupid" and is willing to forgive abscense
Georgia (Something Sensible): oh see thats good
Georgia (Something Sensible): https://giphy.com/gifs/you-got-this-i-believe-in-pro-recovery-pJu3xzRa2PzTq
Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay): I just need to hunker down and catch up
Jess (whoozica): well thats good at least! still its dumb they fucked up so bad D:
Rebecca (madameterralupus): That's bullshit. You shouldn't have to pay for a class you dropped out of before the drop date. If it didn't register it's on them. I'd try to keep fighting it. Hopefully you get something worked out where you don't have to pay for it :/
Tom (tomukuncosplay): Yeah that's super dumb they won't work with you
Rebecca (madameterralupus): Got my laptop back! 🙌🏻 Seems to be working okay so far. Apparently they replaced the whole keyboard 🤔
Also I had a USB from a wireless mouse jammed into one of the ports I could never get out that they managed to get out. So woo!
