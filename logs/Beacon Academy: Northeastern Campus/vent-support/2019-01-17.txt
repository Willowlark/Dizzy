Evie (Katheryne Knight): Oof so I asked a lady for ID today and she pulled the "You're racial profiling me" card.

It's my fucking job. Customer or non-customer
Matt (mattmyers25): You need the I'd depending on what you are doing. Especially at a bank
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Exactly
Matt (mattmyers25): If you dont ask for I'd and something goes wrong, you are in trouble
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Nope. Manager told her I was doing my job
Evie (Katheryne Knight): And so did everyone in the branch
Matt (mattmyers25): Oh bet that made her angry
Rebecca (madameterralupus): People are dumb .-.
Evie (Katheryne Knight): Yeah she said she's going to do what she usually does and complain online
Erik (Red Riot Thot): Oh no, an *online complaint*! You're one weakness!

Anna (Cadmium): I stabbed myself fucking twice with my pyrrha crown in the eye *and i haven't even worn it yet*
Hal [Mobiusmelt Cosplay]: oof i'm sorry
