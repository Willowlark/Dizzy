Sherwood (Will): “I know I don’t get weird looks for how I do my laundry Lynae” Sona says with an amused smirk. With a clunk Sona closes the dresser drawer and walks into the bathroom to shower. “If any of you are around when I finish, I’ll be heading downtown and you’re welcome to join me.” She says as the door closes. She says nothing however of her long shower habits and how long she’ll actually be.
Noctis (CORN BITCH): Vidalia spectats the conversation happening betweemn Sona and Lynae. Were they having an argument or disagreement? She couldn't exactly tell. Vidi stuck close to Patchy unsure how to read the situation
Persimmon (Floob): Patchy looks over at Vidalia, then watches Sona leave. "She can be a bit tough to get along with, can't she?" Patchy comments, then hastily backpedals, "Not that she's a bad person or anything! Just a little... rigid?" She hoped this was helping and not just digging her deeper into a hole. "M-Maybe we *should* go into town, yeah? It could be fun!"
Noctis (CORN BITCH): Vidi shrugs. "I suppose so. What else are we suppose to do today?"The small girl asks curiously since she was oblivious to what was really going on. "Why don't we go first Patch? And then Sona and Lynae can catch up with us."
Persimmon (Floob): "Well, it was Sona's idea, but..." Suddenly, Patchouli remembered a day last week where she made the mistake of showering after Sona and had to make do with freezing water, not a pleasant experience in Vacuo after dark. "...Actually, she'll probably be a while. Let's go, Vidi." Patchy stood up with a tiny smile.
