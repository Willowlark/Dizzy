Sherwood (Will): Percy should have another fate point, remind me to update that later.
Sherwood (Will): From the compel to hit on Gwyn.
Persimmon (Floob): Meh
Persimmon (Floob): I'll just burn it now and you won't have to worry about it.
Persimmon (Floob): And by "now" I mean "after work."
Sherwood (Will): Kk
Noctis (CORN BITCH): I dont wanna do shit today
Persimmon (Floob): ok
Persimmon (Floob): So am I allowed to take my liberties with *why* Percy knows this information and what exactly tipped him off (e.g. some feature of the thugs he noticed)? As long as it doesn't contradict you?
Sherwood (Will): Yup! I wanted to leave it mostly open asides from the connection to Oswald for you to write to flatter Percy.
Sherwood (Will): Nice lore.
Persimmon (Floob): Well, not much of a writer myself so I'd like to just pass you whatever worldbuilding concepts I come up with and see what you can do with them.
Persimmon (Floob): Works out nicely with Percy being street smart.
