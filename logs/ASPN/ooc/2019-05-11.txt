Persimmon (Floob): ~~We could even do that now for a change of pace... Vidi and Patchy are the only VLPS characters established to be in the next scene.~~
Persimmon (Floob): So... What are our signature flashy team attacks?
Noctis (CORN BITCH): I dont remember what patchy can do
Persimmon (Floob): I mean, her semblance determines a lot of it since her fighting style will change depending on whose personality she's using.
Persimmon (Floob): But in her normal form she focuses on speed and can attack with claws or shoot needles from awkward angles.
Persimmon (Floob): What can Vidi do?
Persimmon (Floob): I'm referring to ASPN too when I mention flashy team attacks, btw
Argent (el Cap): Argent could use his semblance for stuff
Persimmon (Floob): Slingshot Noctis into battle
Persimmon (Floob): My first character's team had some pretty cool synergies but I think we're all mostly lone wolves xD
Argent (el Cap): Should I wait to see how Percy's attack affects this dude before I try to do something against him?
Persimmon (Floob): Well I mean, it's either do something or pass your turn
Persimmon (Floob): Sooo
Argent (el Cap): Okay I think I may actually slingshot Noctis into battle then ðŸ˜‚
Argent (el Cap): Will I roll that now?
Argent (el Cap): Like a flashy something
Persimmon (Floob): I'm... not really sure you needed to roll for that?
Persimmon (Floob): If anything, I guess we could classify that action as you trying and failing to give Noctis a boost.
Argent (el Cap): Fair enough like
