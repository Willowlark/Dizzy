Sherwood (Will): Planning to do the next round of combat when I get on the train home tonight, around 5 eastern.
Persimmon (Floob): Hopefully Cap posts then
Persimmon (Floob): I'm at work but I'll continue Chibi in about 4 hours
Persimmon (Floob): I suppose Cap's action is Forceful?
But it's kinda a formality to roll. Nothing's in his way and nobody's trying to stop him
Sherwood (Will): Clever or flashy imo.
Sherwood (Will): Probably clever.
Sherwood (Will): ~~if he closes off the alley we’re trapped in with them lol~~
Sherwood (Will): And he would have to roll to actually create an advantage.
Sherwood (Will): So <@!203874275982049280> you’d wanna role (!fudge since you don’t have your character in with Dizzy) and add your clever stat to it.
Sherwood (Will): And I set a difficulty for the action.
Sherwood (Will): We’re facing out of a dead end alleyway, with a fire escape above us. You want to bring down part of the buildings at the front of the alley to close it off?
Argent (el Cap): Yeah so the dudes can't run
Persimmon (Floob): I feel like 2 should be enough considering he's literally unopposed.
Persimmon (Floob): ~~And I kinda figured it was forceful just cuz trying to cause heavy property damage with a cannon isn't particularly well thought out, but I guess Argent thinks he's being clever.~~
Argent (el Cap): It's very clever
Argent (el Cap): >.>
Sherwood (Will): It’s about his intention. He’s doing it to keep them from escaping. I’d say he was being forceful if he was doing it as a show of power.
Sherwood (Will): Doing that interpretation is what everyone should do. Unless it’s bullshit (“I sneakily blow up the building”) I’m not planning on arguing with your assessment of the characters approach.
Persimmon (Floob): But if he was doing it as a show of power, I'd see that more as Flashy since he's trying to show off.
~~This is the problem with this system, you can word anything to fit any approach.~~
Sherwood (Will): Which is in part why it’s so suited to this. The rules don’t restrict you from doing the creative thing you wanted to do they just give you a frame work for how you’ll do it when you do.
Persimmon (Floob): Eh.
I just feel like since the rules are so loose there's no reason to ever NOT use your +3 approach. So it's limiting rather than liberating if anything.
Sherwood (Will): Don't focus on the mechanics. Focus on what makes sense for the writing of the character. It works surprisingly well in practice, believe it or not. I'm also here as "GM" to say 'you can't *always* act that way.
Dizzy: Following keys updated: `patchy`.
Persimmon (Floob): !chload patchy Patchouli Breschi
