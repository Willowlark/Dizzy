Sherwood (Will): Speaking of.
Sherwood (Will): As a reminder, this girls going to be a younger teen, 14 or 15. So Persimmon would likely brag about wooing her, get closer, go oh crap, and have to salvage the scenario. 

Compels are entirely optional. You get a Fate Point in return for your characters ~~suffering~~ acceptance though. Fate Points let you *Invoke* which is a +2 to a roll related to an aspect or you can throw a Fate Point and say ‚Äúbecause X aspect, this should happen‚Äù in a positive light. Ie,

*because Sherwood has `Beauty in Simplicity`, he should be able to impress the art dealer when talking about the modern art painting*
Sherwood (Will): So if you take the compel, just do like ‚Äú(accept compel)‚Äù in the post.
Sherwood (Will): And if you don‚Äôt do ‚Äú(refusing compel)‚Äù.

Argent (el Cap): I think av developed lactose intolerance
Argent (el Cap): so may be a while before a post haha
Noctis (CORN BITCH): HAAAAA
Noctis (CORN BITCH): SUFFER
Noctis (CORN BITCH): üî™ üëå üî™
Persimmon (Floob): Uhhh... Sounds like TMI to me-
Persimmon (Floob): Meanwhile I developed allergies, I guess.
Persimmon (Floob): ~~Since you specifically mentioned she's young I think it's time to make this as awkward as possible for Percy~~
Noctis (CORN BITCH): 10/10
Sherwood (Will): That‚Äôs exactly how you own a compel 11/10
Sherwood (Will): Oop
Dizzy: Persimmon Burhan (percy) had 3 in Fate Points, I changed it to 4.
Sherwood (Will): !chmod percy Fate Points 4
Sherwood (Will): Nice.
Persimmon (Floob): I gave Patchy a temporary serviceable stunt but it's not necessarily going to stick. I still wanna implement a mechanic where her approaches shift slightly with her semblance but I don't know how exactly.
Sherwood (Will): I didn‚Äôt have Sherwood run up and start talking cause I wanna give other people the chance to cover Percy.
Sherwood (Will): ~~or roast him~~
Sherwood (Will): Ye floo, I had a stunt for sona that was just. In character but not stunt worthy at first.
