Dizzy: the large man shrugs off Sherwood's headbutt like it's nothing, and grabs onto the smaller man's shoulders. With a yank, the thug tries to toss Sherwood backwards into the alley, with enough force to slam the Huntsman in Training into the dead end wall. 

The thug takes advantage of how clumsy the long sniper rifle is in Persimmon's offhand, pushing the barrel up at the last second so the shot flies harmless into the building behind them. The man glances quickly at the state of his allies, seeing two already down and does some mental math on his odds of making it through the encounter should he keep battling. 

Instead of stepping in to further combat Percy, the man shoves the sniper rifle as hard as he can, hoping to force the Huntsman in training to drop the rifle, or at least cause him to release his grip on the girl as the man reached to pull her into his grasp.
Sherwood (Will): !ghost the large man shrugs off Sherwood's headbutt like it's nothing, and grabs onto the smaller man's shoulders. With a yank, the thug tries to toss Sherwood backwards into the alley, with enough force to slam the Huntsman in Training into the dead end wall.

Sherwood (Will): Sherwood grimaces as his headbutt does more damage to him than his target. He barely has time to finish groaning before being tossed headfirst towards the wall. He tried to roll with it, but the best he can do is spin enough so his back slams against the wall and not his skull.

(ooc: 4 shifts damage, 2 Stress Mild Consequence "Concrete Backflop")

Groaning in pain as his back throbs, Sherwood slowly gets to his feet. He watches the man start to approach to finish him off, noticing the arrow still lodged in the man's leg. The man's aura was keeping it from damaging him, but it was still there. Sherwood smiles wryly before lifting a hand from his kneeling position to point at the arrow. 

"This better work..." He says as he activates his lightning semblance, letting electricity arc towards the arrow like a lightning rod. Assumably it'll shock the living day lights out of the man too. 

(ooc: Flashy Attack)
Persimmon (Floob): (ooc: clever defend action success)

Percy was actually hoping his opponent would try a stunt like that. There's one advantage he couldn't possibly known about: Sunset's second form. Knowing this advantage and always thinking on his feet, Percy transforms Sunset onto a staff and hits the little button near his palm. A blast of gravity dust launches the two sides in opposite directions, creating considerable distance between them.

Just before landing, Percy switches Sunset back and catches a quick glimpse of light in his peripheral vision. He immediately locates the source, an injured Sherwood and his furious assailant. The sniper simply can't let this opportunity to upstage his partner slide.

This time with both hands, Percy takes aim at the thug with the arrow in his leg. "Dammit, Sher, you get in more trouble than I do!" he calls out, ensuring all eyes are on him when he takes the shot.
