Sherwood (Will): Sherwood moves to the downed men, patting them down for personal j formation. “Percy, do you recognize what... underground element these guys came from? Maybe that could give us a clue of what to expect.” He asks, tossing whatever he finds into a pile next to him. “Have to know the prey...” He mumbles. 

*(ooc: Percy can spend a fate point to know that these are for hire goons out of a group that caters to the rich and famous’s underhanded needs.)*
Persimmon (Floob): (ooc: Sure.)

"Well, I don't really see anything stand-out about the guys we knocked out... But that in itself is suspicious." Percy speculates. "The gangs of Remnant wear their affiliations with pride, normally in some way that will be with them until death, like a tattoo. But there's this group called The Faceless who intentionally avoid that kind of branding. Their higher-ups are extremely elusive and their goons are just normal guys who are on their own if they get caught.

"That kind of anonymity is highly desirable, especially to those with an image to maintain. In other words, their services are as expensive as they are exclusive. Can't say who's after your bow, but I at least know they're rich and they really want it." Percy decides that this story will work for now. Perhaps the details will... evolve as time goes on.
