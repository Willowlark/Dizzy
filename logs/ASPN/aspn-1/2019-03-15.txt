Persimmon (Floob): "Y-Yeah, duh, I could see that. That's... that's why I thought it was weird! That you're wandering around on your own!" Percy backtracks. "Where are your, um, parents?" He smoothly and skillfully changes the subject.
Argent (el Cap): Argent strode up to his teammates, fiddling with his hammer as he did so. "I swear this was a lot...easier...last time I did this..." He mumbled, half to himself and half to Noctis as he unjammed the dusty compartment of Silber Brecher. Dust flew out of the hammer as he gave it a mighty smack, creating a small puddle of ice on the ground in front of him as he fumbled a set of yellow crystals in, before closing the compartment and putting the hammer on his belt. 

Just as he heard... *I'm fourteen, you freak!*

"Yikes," He commented with a sigh as he shook his head at Percy. "Don't mind him, he's," He looked to the girl, "Difficult."
Noctis (CORN BITCH): Noctis was concerned with Argent tinkering with his weapon while they were out. "I don't think you should-" He began to say but it was already too late, the hammer had already released the ice onto the ground. He winces  upon impact then looks at the ice. "Maybe you shouldn't do that in public? Its kind of a safety hazard." Noctis tells Argent then his head snaps to the voice who insulted Percy. What was even going on? Noctis just started laughing clutching his sides. Once he could compose himself he spoke."I don't think she has any Percy."
