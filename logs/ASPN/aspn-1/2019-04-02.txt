Persimmon (Floob): Percy leans back, hands behind his head, and peers through one eye at their uninvited observers. He fakes a yawn, then none-too-subtly prods, "Hey, Sher, nice to catch up with old... 'friends' and all, but we have business I'd like to get done before nightfall."
Sherwood (Will): Following his partner's eyes, Sherwood catches on to the uninvited guests. "Right..." he murmurs. He looks down to the girl and tries to give her a friendly smile. "Might you walk with us, so my friend her can do his shopping while we discuss?" He asks, motioning for the group to start moving as he does.
