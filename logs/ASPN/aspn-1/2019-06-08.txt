Noctis (CORN BITCH): Noctis glances at his team members scanning them for any injuries. He wasn't much help in the fight, he just sat it out. "You aren't sending us on a suicide mission are you?" Noctis asks his leader. As for finding the location the healer has an idea how this city works judging by the number being apart of the location system.  He could say something or stay quiet? Looking over to Percy he opens his mouth to comment. "I might have an idea to find this 59th and Blackwell. If we can find what street we are on and assuming no maps are available."
Persimmon (Floob): "Uh... we're on 52nd, so head north?" Percy offers, giving the obvious solution before hearing whatever Noctis has in mind. "Of course, I'm not sure where Blackwell would be. That side of town's all boring, stuffy suits-types, not really my scene."
Argent (el Cap): "Sure it isn't. You'd rather find yourself in their purses," he said to Percy before turning his eyes to Sher. "If you want to stop this, then we stop this. You're the leader, after all, not any one of us." After a moment of stretching and cracking his knuckled, he spoke up again.

"Let us hunt some thieves."
