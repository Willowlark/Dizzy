Dizzy: No sooner are Gwyn's (designer) sneakers up the fire escape do three men in dark clothes turn the corner in a rush. One more comes up behind them, and looks left and right. He taps one of the three on the shoulder with a nod and the group all pull out stun batons. 

"Alright. Hand over..." The man in back starts.
Sherwood (Will): !ghost No sooner are Gwyn's (designer) sneakers up the fire escape do three men in dark clothes turn the corner in a rush. One more comes up behind them, and looks left and right. He taps one of the three on the shoulder with a nod and the group all pull out stun batons. 

"Alright. Hand over..." The man in back starts.
Sherwood (Will): "You can't have the girl." Sherwood says, thankful to have his bow on him from their shopping trip as he lets the limbs magnetically lock into to place. "You'll have to go through..."
Dizzy: "The bow." the man says in a deadpan, clearly confused by Sherwood's showboating. The four then march into the alley way, ready for a fight. 

**COMBAT ROUND 1**

Dizzy: sher doesn't have that...
Sherwood (Will): !chroll sher quick

Seeing them advance, Sherwood knows he's got time for one arrow before they're on top of him. Quickly pulling an arrow from his quiver, he draws the bow back and launches an arrow for the guy on the right, with the orange mustache and no hair.
Persimmon (Floob): Percy calmly looks through the scope of his rifle, taking in the battlefield below him. "They don't seem to be huntsmen, it probably wouldn't be any trouble to knock them out with one shot. But..." He flashes a sly grin, unlikely to go unnoticed by the girl next to him. "I wanna see the looks on their faces when they're taken down by the bow they came here to steal." With that thought, he cleverly aims for the frontmost thug's legs rather than his head or body and fires an ice round.
