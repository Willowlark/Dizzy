Argent (el Cap): "You're right, Percy, they aren't huntsman. Maybe that means you should go easy on them rather than torturing them with embarassment..." Argent kept a straight face before breaking out into all-smiles. "Ah, who am I kidding? Let's make this fun." 
On that note, Silber Brecher transforms into its hand-cannon form as Argent fires the orange dust at the wall behind the mooks, hoping to impact with the wall and make the men's escape all the more difficult, with rock blocking their way. 
(Attempt to create advantage: Environmental Blockade??????)
Dizzy: The men all converge on Sherwood and Argent, bar the one suddenly rooted to the floor by an ice dust explosion at his feet. This goes poorly for him when Argent blows a chunk out of the apartment building above his head, the stones falling and breaking quite a few of his bones. He screams before passing out. *(ooc: Free compel used on Cold Feet)*

His compatriots swing at Sherwood, hoping to use numbers and brawn to silence the two huntsman in training. Two hooks, one left and one right, come for Sherwood and a single right hook comes flying at Argent.
Sherwood (Will): !ghost The men all converge on Sherwood and Argent, bar the one suddenly rooted to the floor by an ice dust explosion at his feet.

Dizzy: **ROUND 2**
Sherwood (Will): !ghost **ROUND 2**
Sherwood (Will): Sherwood, with two fists flying at him, decides his only escape is forward. He dives to roll out of the way, trying to thread his way through their bodies to get behind them. He just manages to time the roll, the first of one of the men grazing his hair as it passes by.

Knowing he won't be able to loose another arrow at this range, Sherwood lets his bow collapse it's limbs and draws his knife in an underhand. He steps in to attack one of the thugs, only instead of swinging the blade in his hand he punches forward, a feint he hopes will fool the man.
Persimmon (Floob): Percy snickers with amusement like a spectator in the balcony of some grand theater as he watches his partner dive forward. Perhaps their enemy would be stunned by just how... unconventional of a maneuver that was? He decides to take his chances, aiming for the back of the head of the thug that threw the first punch, hoping to catch him by surprise while he's focused on Sherwood.

(ooc: _Sneaky_ attack, rolled 2)
