Dizzy: with Noctis and Persimmon's guidance, 59th and Blackwell is easy to find. It's a vacant office building, two stories high. It's rather non descript from the outside. In one of the windows the team can see cubical upon cubical upon cubical; one large room seems to take up at least 75% of each floor and the room is nothing but cubicals. Judging by where the door is placed on the outside and the wall you can see inside the window, the front door doesn't lead into the cubical space.

Persimmon (Floob): "Maybe we got the wrong place after all?" Percy frowns and peers in through the window. "Sure, it makes sense to conduct shady business out of an abandoned building, but I'd expect a warehouse or something." There is disappointment in his voice as he gazes down the rows of cubicles.
