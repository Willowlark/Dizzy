Sherwood (Will): "I don't think so sir. I prefer to only use Tristram on Beacon's campus or on mission, due to the damage potential." Sherwood says. "Thank you for your time." he adds while stepping back. He waits with Noctis and Argent for Persimmon to finish any of his own business, window shopping the many rifles in the room.
Sherwood (Will): Stepping outside into the sun, the light is bright in everyone's faces, eyes having adjusted to the shop's ambient light. Sherwood wanders to the right of the shop, not sure if it's the right direction but positive Persimmon will tell him off if it isn't. 

Out of the corner of his eye, Sherwood catches a younger girl standing up frantically from a park bench, only to start slowly walking in the direction he did. Her quick leap is the only reason he noticed her in the first place, looking extraordinarily ordinary for the streets of Vale, but notice just the same. 

Halfway down the next block, he slows his gait to walk next to Persimmon. 

"Do your faunus eyes see what my human ones do?" he asks his keen eyed partner.
Persimmon (Floob): "See what? Those two shady Mistralan bankers? That panda faunus with an embarrassing tattoo on his neck? The famous actor we just passed by?" Percy asks, just showing off because he's a dick. "Or were you referring to that suspicious girl up ahead?"
