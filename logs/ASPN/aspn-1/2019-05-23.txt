Sherwood (Will): Sherwood leans against the wall, staring at the pile of personal affects and thinking about Persimmons information. 

“Whoever is after at...” Sherwood says eventually, “is a coward. Come and talk to me directly. And these men are even worse. It may not be our responsibility yet, but even as huntsman in training we should stop this.” Sherwood looks up to face each of his teammates. 

“I know this is entirely my problem, but I hope you’ll still have my back.” He says. “To 59th and Blackwell.” He pauses, trying to figure out how he could possibly find that place  in the massive city. 

*(ooc: Compel: `stone and steel are not forests`, Sherwood has no idea how to get to 59th and Blackwell)*
