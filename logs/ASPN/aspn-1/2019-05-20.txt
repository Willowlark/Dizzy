Sherwood (Will): Sherwood’s knees crack has he stands up. “They wanted my bow remember? That’s what they asked for, not her. At the very least...” Sherwood stares of into the alley, “it’s my fault.”

Sherwood puts a hand over his face, fingertips rubbing his temples. “When Oswald said not to hand over my bow I thought... thought he was just being uncharacteristically paternal. Not that there was literally some group who wanted his weapon. How does that even happen...”
Noctis (CORN BITCH): Noctis observes the conversation happening infront of him. "Why are we babysitting her again? If She caused this to happen to us." He was clear for his distaste for the girl. "They might as well keep her for all I care."
