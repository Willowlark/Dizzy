Sherwood (Will): As they turn the corner, Sherwood speeds up, motioning for Argent and Noctis to keep walking while dragging Gwyn suddenly by the hand into a side alley. He doesn't make a motion to his partner; a year's of experience has told him that sometimes Persimmon knows  where he's most useful better than Sherwood does.

Stepping quickly into the alley, Sherwood speaks quickly. "Gwyn, there's a group of men trailing you. Do you know why that would be?"
Dizzy: "W-what? Gwyn looks back quickly, unable to see them but still feeling the paranoia set in. "Are you sure you're not crazy and a thief?" she says.
Sherwood (Will): !ghost "W-what? Gwyn looks back quickly, unable to see them but still feeling the paranoia set in. "Are you sure you're not crazy and a thief?" she says.
Sherwood (Will): "Well, your opinion of me as a thief aside, I'm a student of Beacon and I can't let you get... kidnapped? Your father is well off is that right? Maybe they're after ransom..." Sherwood trails off, a good thing as his train of thought gets uncomfortably dark for the preteen beside him.
Persimmon (Floob): Sure enough, Percy has a similar take on the situation to his partner. Soon after ducking into the alley, right when he can feel the watchful eyes of the public lose sight of him, he swiftly scales the ladder of a nearby fire escape. "What my partner means to say, Gwyn, is that it might be safer to come up here and let the brutes duke it out on the ground." He smirks, ready to retract the ladder for safety should it prove necessary.
Sherwood (Will): Sherwood nods to Persimmon, then grabs Gwyn around the waist evoking a squeak of protest. Sherwood lifts her to reach the fire escape ladder, letting her scramble up after Percy.
