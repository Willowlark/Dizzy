**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-05*

As Eliran walked into the market area with Afina, he could hear a familiar offended tone, "Pardon?" Was all he needed to know who was in trouble. He sighed to himself, Well good thing I have my, our,  papers And walked over to the sound, and upon seeing Elfriede and and his two copatriots, immediately went to work. 
"Nokri, Aldus, How are you guys holding up?" He started with a smile, arms spread in greeting, Eliran quickly passed Elfriede and stood in between the knight and his friends. "Get everything we need for tonight?" Eliran asked Aldus, before looking towards Elfriede, acting as if he just noticed the knight, "May Lylalels guidance be with you," he said with a slight bow, then as if noticing Elfriede disposition he asked, "I'm sorry is something the matter?" Eliran asked sounding genuinely concerned, still standing between the two.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

Following behind Eliran, Afina saw his companions before she spotted her own. _A small Drecan and a wolf laguz… interesting company to keep, Eliran,_ Afina thought, analyzing the two that Eliran had greeted so warmly. _Are they his friends? Eliran was always awfully popular in our youth,_ Afina thought. _And for a southern Drecan and seemingly Wynne laguz to be in the same place… they must be people that Eliran had picked up along the way._ Afina couldn’t say she was awfully surprised, Eliran was social like that. 

It was only then that Afina realized who they were talking to. _Elfriede!_ The knight looked stern, but strangely out of place as he looked between the three foreigners that stood before him, still holding Afina’s bag in his arms. The Eraian seemed like he was going to address Eliran in particular, and it was almost comical seeing Elfriede try to stare down the musician. _This is quite the horrid first impression,_ the princess thought, hurrying to the spot where the four had gathered. 

“Elfriede!” she called, nearly crashing into her escort as she came to a stop. She grabbed his arm in the typical escort-charge position. “I’m terribly sorry, I left my family crest back at the monastery. It’s important to me so the second I realized it was missing, I-- well, you understand,” Afina explained hurriedly. _Now to resolve this… hopefully_, Afina thought, turning to gesture at Eliran with her free hand awkwardly. “Elfriede, this is Eliran, one of my friends from my youth. It seems his entourage is also in Trisp on business similar to our own. How interesting that fate would align so that we could meet here, yes?” she explained quickly. Afina tried to smile to release the tension; The princess hoped that she did not look as tense as she felt that she did.

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

_(ooc: GM postless round)_

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-13*

Elfriede face fell into a “fed-up” visage. The man who just stepped in front of him greeted him as if he didn’t just interrupt his important conversation. He had only **just** gotten them to agree to come with him. As the proud Eraian knight opened his mouth to speak he was suddenly greeted again by… *Afina?* Who quickly grasped his arm. The princess’s quick explanation that she knew this man and his friends made Faun’s head swirl. So much just happened in that 10 second span that Elfriede had to briefly close his eyes to take it all in.

He sighed briefly, “I’ll stand down… but do tell me why your friend has a Drecan in his company... Who furthermore looks like she's been through hell.” He said frustrated while raising his free hand in the direction of the blonde Drecan. He took in her tired but young features, her pseudo smile, and her injuries. He couldn't help but feel bad for her despite everything.

“And…” his gaze turned towards the white haired man, to which he spoke in a confused tone. “...a northerner?” he gazed at the laguz, hair clearly recently washed. He owned a stern visage, a trait of the wolves that Elfriede knew all too well… yet there was something aloof about him, but he radiated a kind spirit.

Desii didn't step up behind Eliran as the bard stepped between the Eraian knight, and she certainly didn't follow the Princess as she clung to said knight's arm. The scenario looked like something out of one of her mother's trashy (but secretly rather enjoyable) romance novels. The two childhood friends reunite, only to find their respective groups at odds with each other. Sure, no blades were drawn, but it paints a pretty picture. It even covers the racism sub genre, if you include the human knight threatening a laguz. 

Still, they hadn't been in Trisp half a clock's rotation yet, Desii prayed they wouldn't be arrested in so little a time. Her eyebrow quirks as she mentally corrects herself. *"Hopefully we aren't arrested at all, despite Nokri's heritage."*

Thankfully the knight backs down at the Princess's words. Part of her wants to question why an Eraian knight is taking orders from a Callorian, but she felt it wise to not comment on their salvation. The knight still had questions though, and helping local law enforcement is always a good thing. She looked to Aldus and Eliran, not even bothering to considering Nokri. Aldus seemed bothered by the knight, and Eliran just set himself against him. Desii gulps.

"G-good afternoon Sir Knight." Desii says, stepping forward. She gives a small curtsy of her hip cape, blinking quickly as she remembers reading Eraian traditions once. She hurries out of the curtsy stance (somehow managing to wobble slightly) and extends her hand to the knight before her, palm down. As she recalled, knights kiss the hands of ladies in Eraia upon meeting them; a tradition started to honor Lylalel's feminine form and call reference to a Eraian knight's service to her above all. Desii looks down at the ground the whole time, unable to imagine looking at the knight while he kissed her. She hoped her cheeks didn't blush at all.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

Aldus doesn't even know where to begin with this confusion. One minute he's bartering with Nokri, her trying to get him to buy her things, the next he's having a sword drawn on him and nearly getting arrested, the next some blonde woman is running up to the seemingly tight-laced knight and now he just looks annoyed, like she's ruined some scheme of his. Aldus is beginning to regret coming to Eraia at all. He didn't do anything wrong... what reason does this Eraian knight have to even want to arrest them?! Suddenly remembering the lack of laguz around he thinks to himself *is this what racism feels like?* Nokri is also of an uncommon appearance it would seem. *this is completely unjust* He stares at the knight sternly, offended. Despite the lack of laguz in sight, Aldus can smell the familiar scent of a fellow Naissankari near by.  He flares his nostrils, inhaling in attempt to get a better idea, they must be close due to the strength of the smell, or perhaps one of these two newcomers has recently mated with a Naissankari? He feels a pang of loneliness at the thought, but shakes it off.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-14*

Great. Here come music boy to the rescue again. Nokri's mouth formed a displeased line as Eliran and his entourage came up to their little party. Surprisingly though, he was actually coming to their defense and helping to escalate the situation instead of straight-up blaming it all on Nokri. Nice.

Desii and another random woman were just behind him. Desii was trying to suck up to the knight by doing her cute thing, *please. Get in line, girl. I've been trying that and it isn't working.* Then she just stuck her hand out weirdly. Nokri ignored her. The other girl seemed much more interesting. The blonde was well put-together, appeared to have some degree of control over this knight, spoke in a rather regal tone... and did she mention a family crest? *Helloooo, miss. Who might you be?*

"Do you have any proof that I'm Drecan? And now you're assuming his origins too?" She gestured at Aldus. "I already requested you *please* stop jumping to conclusions," she protested again. Her tone was polite and innocent-sounding with a hint of sternness. Yeah, she was Drecan, but this guy had no solid proof at the moment and thus had no basis for his discrimination. Nokri wanted to see him struggle and maybe get some reparations for his upfront behavior.

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

The restaurant Eliran leads the group of 6 to is called Goldsmoke, a title which makes you question just how it came into being.  It's a small building, surprising given the spacious areas of Trisp. The interior is dark reddish wood, with two fireplaces lit and blazing. Between the fire places and other light sources the room takes on a warm hue which is quite comforting. a stage occupies one corner of the tavern floor, though no band is present on it. The bar is staffed by one man in robes rather than the typical bartender, though he elicits smiles all the same. Tables decorate the rest of the tavern, more tightly than most taverns. It's clear Goldsmoke caters more to people looking to eat well, rather than people looking for a quick drink. There's no issue getting a table for the 6 of you, given the hour. Your varied party earns a momentary look from the waitress, but she is professional and says nothing more than what she needs to.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-18*

Afina Tyndall had to admit, she was impressed with Eliran’s choice in tavern. She wasn’t so sure that the choice to eat dinner together was all that wise given Elfriede’s altercation in the marketplace, but she was anxious to hear of their party’s travels. The Laeran felt as if she was entering a hearth as they stepped foot into the tavern; The walls were a dark red, like ebony wood, and the light from the fireplaces casted an orange glow across the faces of all who entered. Afina looked around the tavern as the waitress led the six to a seat; An empty stage caught the princess’ eye. _I wonder if Eliran will do what I think he will..._ she thought.  

Afina was careful to find a seat next to Elfriede as they were placed at a large round table. Both the women from earlier seemed to eye the other seat next to hear, but Afina hardly noticed, and Eliran gracefully took his place next to his childhood friend. Directly across the table sat the laguz man, and Afina tried to sneak another glance at him. _He looks very much like Atalantia, they must be from the same region,_ Afina thought, shrugging off her warm winter cloak. _Hopefully he isn’t as naive about the mainland culture_. As the waitress took their orders, Afina hesitated on her choice for the night; Chicken was always a favorite of hers, as it was every Laerans, but a new culture meant new experiences. She ordered the most expensive fish on the menu with a curt nod.

As a silence settled over the table, each members gazing about the tavern, or sipping their drink, or staring at the ground, Afina cleared her throat. “As a gesture of goodwill, I would like to state that such a billing for the dinner will be covered by the house of Tyndall,” Afina declared. The tone in her voice was unmistakably formal, but a trained pair of eyes could see the princess nervously thumbing her tunic’s sleeves. Realizing her own anxious quirk, Afina placed her hands in her lap. _It doesn’t help that I detest long sleeves, especially in such a warm tavern,_ the princess thought. As the others began to speak up, Afina glanced at Elfriede; He had not spoken much since their encounter in the marketplace. She nudged his boot with her own, raising one eyebrow questioningly.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-18*

As the group gathered and sat around the table Eliran looked around. The Goldsmoke hadn't changed a bit since his last visit, which he was glad to know. As he took his place next to Afina at the round table, he gestured for Nokri to sit between him and Aldus, figuring the relative distance from Elfriede, and security of sitting between two people she knew would help her out, _Plus if she says anything dumb I can hit her under the table_ He thought to himself, still not quite trusting Nokri to not make up a tall tale to defend herself from who knows what. As Afina made her declaration of Patronage for the night Eliran looked at his party. Clearly the formal tone was not something that was helping ease any tensions. He shook his head slightly, and responded, "Generous as usual Afrin," He said with a grin, intentionally using his old nickname for her to try and change the mood as the Waitress arrived with something he had ordered when they entered. Taking the two bottles in hand, Eliran stood and addressed the table. “so I know you we’re all a bit on edge at the moment, but I hope we can get along. Tonight is a night of meeting friends, old and potentially new,” he gave a nod to Elfriede, “and since we've finally reached our destination, I say its it's a good night to relax and have fun” he finished with a grin, popping open one of the bottles, quickly pouring and passing drinks around to everyone.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-18*

Nokri stuck out like a clown on a unicycle at a funeral. But perhaps because of her surrounding company, no one approached or said anything. They just stared out of the corners of their eyes. Who could blame them? 

Luckily, the roaring fireplaces covered the stench of her dirty clothes, and she purposefully took a seat closest to the flames. Eliran and Aldus sat beside her. *At least the fireplace covers the dog smell, too.* She summoned the last dredges of elegance within her to exude as much of an innocent and ladylike presence as possible in front of the princess, repressing the urge to smirk at the knight sitting opposite her and crack a vulgar joke about him sitting at this round table.

The menu looked pricey. Like nothing Nokri had ever seen before. *Is this some form of extortion? Will eating this put us into indentured servitude?* But upon hearing it would all be paid for, her eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. "That is most kind of you, princess. Are you certain?" Saliva was nearly spilling out of her mouth as she asked, eyes glued to the menu. She was automatically drawn to the most expensive option, regardless of how much she would enjoy the taste. Common courtesy dictated she order a dish less expensive than what the host is purchasing. But the blonde was a madman. She went and picked the most expensive item! No doubt about it, she was wealthy.

"Hear hear!" Nokri chimed at Eliran's statement, "let us enjoy ourselves after a long and tiresome journey." It didn't take long for her to acquire some of the drink going around and down half a glass of it. But slowly, and lady-like. "Eliran, if you need more to drink I can refill your glass anytime." If he got drunk enough he might spill more beans about his family.

Nokri went with a braised veal stew, the third most expensive item to avoid suspicion. She knew someone from their party would be on her case in a hot minute if she ordered something too costly. *Maybe next time, o lovely fish.*
"Aldus, what are you having?" She asked idly, mentally betting it'd be something with a bone in it. *Maybe he'll take home a doggy bag. Ha.*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-19*

To say Aldus felt uncomfortable in the Goldsmoke would be an understatement. The decor was rich and dark and the restaurant was uncomfortably warm even in his light tunic. He makes a mental note to pick up some lighter clothing, as he doesnt think walking around topless is going to be socially acceptable in Eraia. 

He follows the others lead on where to sit, ending up in between Nokri and Desi and across from the princess. Aldus sits up straight and folds his drapes his napkin neatly over his lap, trying to remember scraps of table manners he’s been trying to pick up on since his blunder a few weeks ago. 

He notes that Eliran seems very informal with the princess, calling her some silly nickname. When the princess offers to pay for the meals, Aldus is relieved. The prices on this menu are a little out of his spending comfort level. Granted Aldus is not a poor man, he gets by, but only because he doesn't waste coin on frivolous means such as these. Eliran has drinks covered it seems, and proposes a toast of sorts. Aldus makes a conscious effort to only sip, and not chug the drink down. Nokri is still holding up her good girl visage, which is unsettling and a little creepy for lack of a better word. She even  asks him politely what he is going to order, although Aldus can see her fakeness at this point, he narrows his eyes at the smaller blonde accordingly. 

He scans the menu, noting that most of is fish, in a variety of price ranges as well. *The Eraians must really like fish* he thinks to himself. He decides on a moderately priced option. “I believe I will order the salmon. When in Eraia, right?” *Is that how the phrase goes?*

Desii settles into her oak chair with an eye on the rest of the table. It wasn't long ago Nokri did something to anger Sir Elfriede, and yet here they were having dinner with the man. Desii nestles her knapsack between her feet as she pulls her chair in, a foot through the shoulder loop of the sack. She may be with company tonight but habits she'd picked up from traveling out of Hylley alone stuck with her. No one would steal Zaimar's book from her.

Desii puts the unpleasant thought and returns her attention to the room, Eliran giving a toast to new friends. Desii clumsily grasps her own mug and clanks warmly, smiling to everyone at the table, especially the Princess beside her. Her smiles breaks as she drinks the Eraian stout. Desii sputters what little of the brew she had drank back into her mug, flushing bright red as she tries to hide behind her raised mug. 

"I think I'd best stick to the wine..." she mutters sheepishly, to the apparently amusement of the group. *The waitress too* Desii moans internally, noticing the smile on the barmaid's face. Desii buries her face in the menu as a distraction, deciding after a few moments to order the salmon like Aldus. She takes another moment to relax before rejoining the conversation.

*"Hear hear!" Nokri chimed at Eliran's statement, "let us enjoy ourselves after a long and tiresome journey."*

"That'd be nice I think." Desii says, resting her elbows on the table and her head in her palms. "Tomorrow will be busy, The town isn't large but I can't imagine finding one person will be terribly easy." Desii muses aloud. She frowns slightly, adding "If Enera is even here."

"What will the rest of you do? I don't know how long you wish to stay in Trisp, though I hope we won't have to part too soon." She says, mostly to her own companions but with a nod to Princess and her*?* knight.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-20*

Elfriede sat slumped forward in the hard chair, his head still spinning from the previous encounter. He wore a melancholic partial frown with narrow eyes as he glanced to each person at the table. Despite the mounting evidence that these travelers were quite fine being left well enough alone, he couldnt shake his pre existing bias long enough to stop occasionally glancing at Nokri. Something about the girl just felt off to him. 

Suddenly, he felt a light kick on the side of his boot from Afina who had clearly noticed his frustrated and quiet behavior as being a bit out of the ordinary. Faun realized he hadn’t said a word to her since the encounter.

Elfriede began to second guess himself. "*Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh...*" He said quietly to her, not turning toward her whilst other conversation was happening around them. He tried sitting up straight more and *tried* to not look so miserable. *Perhaps… I should make it up to her.*, he thought to himself, for the girl seeps actually relatively sweet. Elfriede accepted the toast and raised his mug as well, brought it to his mouth and gently sipped it as he would often do. 

All this nonsense he got himself into broke his concentration from all the things he was stressing about before Afina suddenly bolted off. He turned his gaze toward her and smiled a bit, sighing lightly. He wanted to say *something* but he still felt hard pressed for words. He’d probably apologize to Nokri and Afina… later… this hardly seemed the place in front of everyone.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

It’s only after the waitress brought their food, and Afina was mid-chew, that the princess realized that “Enera” sounded like a familiar name. _Where have I heard that before?_ she thought, tapping her fork against the table as she thought. “Enera…” she mumbled, eyebrows furrowed in concentration. “Where did I hear that name?”

Afina sat up straight as she remembered the Bishop yelling at a child in the monastery. _Enera is a little girl?_ she thought, glancing between the members of Eliran’s party. _Why would they be looking for a little girl?_ The princess took a sip of her drink, staring into it thoughtfully. It had been a long time since she last saw Eliran; He hadn’t been very good at keeping in touch (though that had always been the case ever since they were kids). She hoped his motivations were still honest and true.

Afina looked over at her childhood companion, musing about their time spent together in their youth. Eliran had always been the worldly one, with his travelling and socializing and exploring. Her younger self had always been fascinated by him. Afina still vividly remembered the time he spent living with the Tyndalls, becoming accustomed to the noble lifestyle. A time before she knew light magic, when she spent her time reading and “playing queen” in the castle. Eliran had begrudgingly been “the king” a few times, but only after she cried when she didn’t get her way. Many had assumed that the two were to be betrothed as kids, but Afina’s father had strictly insisted that Afina find a companion of her own volition, and the princess herself was quite content to have Eliran as a brotherly figure instead. The Laeran frowned. _I hope you still are the way that the younger Afina would have known you_, Afina thought, hands fidgeting in her lap. To search for an adult for ill-will was one thing, but a child… 

“I believe there is an Enera at the monastery, yes?” Afina said, seeking confirmation from Elfriede. “She was young though, no more than a child. She must have been practicing light magic, if memory serves.” Afina pauses a moment to look between the members of the table. “I take it that this changes your plans considerably?”

---
Afina sat in her nightgown, legs crossed, focusing on the light tomes in her lap. Thinking about Eliran’s role in her childhood had made the princess nostalgic; She had returned back to the many cantrips she first learned in her youth. Afina concentrated hard on the symbols on the page (though not inebriated, the princess had to admit that she was feeling more light-hearted than usual thanks whatever Eliran had ordered for the table, and as such wasn’t able to focus quite as precisely). Her fingers traced the unintelligible language as she read, and soon after, sparks began to twinkle down from the ceiling. Afina gazed up in awe, still reciting the familiar words of one of her first spells. _Amazing to return to, after all this time,_ she thought, the sparks falling gently down like snow. 

The princess paused as she heard movement out in the hallway; It was still relatively early, and therefore not completely ludicrous to think that someone from the party might have needed her attention. Eliran may have wanted to learn what she had been up to, Desii may have had questions about light magic already, the… small blonde...person that Afina forgot the name of. What was her name? Maybe she hadn’t even introduced herself yet. “Present yourself before the light of Laera!” Afina called through the door.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

Once the food had come out, Eliran could tell that the two vastly different parties were starting to become more comfortable with eachother. He kept a casual eye on Elfriede in particular, hoping that the meal was lowering the mans suspicions around Nokri, who's excessive politeness, while mildly unsettling, was greatly appreciated.

---- 
A little later in the meal, people had started to enter the Goldsmoke as it gradually approached the proper meal time. The waitress came up to the table to whisper something in the Bards ear. With a short nod, he looked to his companions, "Guys I'll be right back, I just need to take care of something." He then poured one more round of the drink the waitress had brought, passing it around. As for himself, he didn't take any, having only just finished his first glass, which was surprising as he normally would have been drinking with the rest of them, especially considering Nokri's persistent offers to fill it up once more, though he had a sneaking suspicion she had added some to his cup when he wasn't looking. 
As he stood up, he grabbed his lute case and followed the waitress away. 
Not long after, a light sound of music filled the Goldsmoke, there were no words, just the faint pickings of strings permeating the air. It was a soothing sound, far from the typically bright and  energized sound of most taverns, instead giving a calm and homely, much like the Goldsmoke in and of itself. 
Eliran sat in the middle of the stage, and outside the sound of music from his fingers, it was as if he was in a different world, untouched by those around him. He enjoyed the mental quiet playing brought him. There was no Nokri, no girl in need of saving, no Knight arresting friends, or childhood friends demanding later. Just him and his instrument, sure there may be people watching, but while the music was to entertain them, they had no bearing on his sound. It was the perfect escape for a man who lived in a constantly social sphere, to perform for that circle and get the quiet that focusing on playing brought.

--- 
After a while, Eliran finished playing, and was replaced by other musician. Probably the Goldsmokes typical performer. As he returned to the table, it was clear everybody had finished their food, and that at least a couple of them were slightly inebriated as well. It was time to head home for the evening, and after they paid, he walked out with his friends, feeling significantly more relaxed.

-----
Later that night, Eliran headed towards Afina's room at the Monastery. After a year of no contact at all, he wanted to catch up, and something he heard her say at dinner got him wondering. _I really hope she doesn't chew me out about not writing... I deliver letters not write them_ he thought to himself as he approached her door.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

Aldus didn't think meals could get anymore awkward then the one he just experienced. This whole town was weird, he expected the whole country might be just as so. And what was that knight getting at anyway? He makes a side note to catch up more on international relations now that they seems to be having an impact on his day-to-day life. He concludes to be done with his business in Eraia as soon as possible and get out before he can be roped into more unwanted situations such as the one this morning.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-23*

Nokri was on cloud nine all evening. Good food with prestigious company and light entertainment, and she wouldn't have to pay a cent. She decided to live in the moment and enjoy this while it lasted. Heaven knows she earned it. She was on her best behavior even after several rounds of free drinks.

After dinner, they each parted ways and Nokri was incredibly pleased to find she even had her own room, with a complementary set of clean pajamas folded neatly on the bed. *Wonderful! This is how things ought to be.* She enjoyed a brief respite by plopping down on the bed and basking in the comfiness  Voices in the hall caught her attention, and she curiously made her way to the door. She pressed her ear against it to listen, hearing two familiar voices but struggling to make out what they were saying.

Desii perks up at Afina's revelation. "That's wonderful news. I'll have to visit the monastery tomorrow to meet with her." Desii says through a beaming smile. The Hylleyian girl wanted to ask more, but the topic was lost to the flow of conversation, and to the arrival of their meals. Desii sighs to herself. *It's no issue, I can find her tomorrow myself. I couldn't tear a Princess away from the conversations that interest her.* 

- - - - -

Desii retires to her room shortly after dinner, not wanting to be out in the town too late. Trisp is a warm and cozy town, but the sun sets on every town, leaving the streets empty and the lights extinguished. Walking about, even with Aldus and Nokri by her side, worries a bit. Desii had no intention of sleeping however. Zaimar's tome is immediately cracked open upon her bed as she settles into a comfortable reading position. While Zaimar's intentions for the tome were foul, the knowledge contained could be used for more noble purposes. She'd be sure to see to that.

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

```
Trisp Park, by the fountain
```

Desii knew from the moment Afina walked up that the Princess had no luck with her friend at the monastery. It was all the more confirmed by the Princess shaking her head at Desii's hopeful look. She also notes Nokri with Princess Afina, sparing Aldus a quick glance. The wolf laguz's mood always sours when the Drecian is around. 

After greetings are exchanged Afina starts to elaborate on what hapened in the monastery, though Desii becomes distracted before she hears anything of consciquence. The brunette stands quickly, tripping slightly towards the Princess. The only reason she fails to hit into Afina is the strong shoulder of Aldus she used to support herself. She recovers quickly and jumps up and down, waving. 

"Eliran! Sir Faun! Over here!" she calls, spotting the two in question walking in the direction of the monastery. She motions for the two men to join them. 

"Princess Afina was about to tell us some information about Enera Eliran." Desii says. She nods to the Knight-lieutenant, unsure how casual to be with him. She then turns back to Afina, returning to her seat on the fountain's edge in front of the presenting Princess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

Afina exhaled as she finally reached her companions. “So, there are two possibilities that are yielded from my talk with the Cardinal. He said that I am the only Callorian studying with the monastery; Either he’s telling the truth, and this is not the Enera we seek. Or he’s lying, and does not want us--or at least, _me_-- to know such a fact.”

Afina’s eyes flickered to Elfriede and Eliran, whom she had not had time to properly greet as they walked up. Her gaze lingered on the Eraian knight, having not seen him since they spoke last night, but she quickly dismissed the thoughts that wavered in the back of her mind. The princess was serious as she addressed those gathered around her. 

“Truly, he _did_ seem confused when I asked him about another Callorian. He tensed his muscles, moved to grab his cane, and was very hesitant to respond. However, this may be a result of confusion, or deception. It’s difficult to truly discern whichever it might be. I claimed that a bishop indicated that another Callorian was here; The Cardinal said I was given false information. Nonetheless, the monastery is likely curious about the innocent mistake, or we truly are onto something that they would rather keep hidden.”

Finally, the Callorian sighs. “Either we are simply wrong, and this is not the Enera we are searching for. Or there are very real political consequences at stake here. The question left is, how does one proceed from here?”

Desii frowns at Afina's information. 

"Why would he want to hide such a fact? What benefit is there?" Desii thinks aloud. She stands up, starting to pace up and down the side of the fountain. "He showed visible signs of discomfort at the mention of another Callorian. But why Callorian? The bishop I spoke to had no problems acknowledging Enera was at the Monastery, he just wouldn't let me meet her. She can't be that busy she has no time to meet someone." 

"If that translates, Enera isn't the topic that made the Cardinal uncomfortable. It's the fact that Princess Afina referred to Enera as a Callorian. Why is *that* the problem the Cardinal had, rather than the same one the Bishop did?" Desii trails off as she stares intently at her boot prints in the dirt, continuing to pace. You can see her press her tongue against her cheek in thought as she walks.

Desii sits back down on the fountain rim, arms crossed and eyes glaring at her own feet. 

"We need more information. I can't go back to Dain and Saila like this." she mutters. Her foot starts to tap in the dirt.

"Princess Afina, might you invite us over after dinner? You saw the girl's room, at least for study. If you guide us in the evening hour no one should bother us and if I happen past that room looking for a bathroom the Cardinal can't complain." Desii says, the plan flashing through her head. It sent a nervous energy through her; a week ago she was practicing combat magic and now she's planning an infiltration? These were things she'd never have imagined doing back in Hylley and yet she wasn't hesitating in the slightest.

And that's exactly why, she supposed. Doing this for Enera, be this the Enera she's heard so much about or not, is worth taking seriously. It may not be ideal, but... Zaimar showed her the world isn't always ideal. 

Rapidly shaking her head to clear her thoughts, she looks up at the Princess. "We'll see you at 8pm, after the sun has set. 

- - - - -

Desii approaches the Monastery with Aldus, Eliran and Nokri. Despite the whole thing behind her idea, she's found herself walking behind the two men in her party. She holds her back in hands, clenching the carry strap in hands. Despite the confidence she had before, she was rocked with nerves. Her resolve hadn't faltered, but saying and doing were two different things!

She was thankful for her friends support. Without them, she didn't think she could be coming here right now. She knew she was doing it for the right reasons, but damned if the idea didn't still scare her. 

The appointed time came, with the sun setting over the distant seaside cliffs. She wrung her bag tighter as she waited for Elfriede and Afina to open the door to signal them in.

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

(ooc:  Everyone should narrate themselves into the scene, it's a scene setting round. Afina will be on <#361532671714656266> instead of here, for reasons.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-21*

Faun felt, in general, dismissive of this whole situation. It didn't involve him or Afina and in general seemed like reckless speculation. Enera could have been the daughter of one of the higher-ups easily. He felt these new *friends* were acting on levels of speculation with little to no evidence, which made him uncomfortable acting. 

Faun faded back into the conversation as Desi spoke about the meetup. His eyes drifted to Afina who appeared to be listening intently. He hadn't seen her the entire day. Her face brought the memories flooding back, which he closed his eyes briefly to suppress. Despite it all,seeing her face gave him a sort of calmness.

*If she wants to go along with it, I suppose so will I… for now*, although he doubted the wisdom of the decision. Faun locked eyes with her for a brief moment in which he smiled and nodded at her, but no words were exchanged between the two in that moment. *It hasn't been long enough, perhaps I need more time to think...*, he thought to himself as the group departed. Their planned chat about their future together clearly wasn't happening tonight...
---
Several hours later at the appointed time, Elfriede arrived at the door exactly on time. He glanced around at the absence of the princess, sighing in a failed attempt to relieve his jumpy nerves. After a few moments, he whispered at the dark part of the hallway, *“Fina?”*, to no response. Slightly enerved, he placed his hands firmly against the door where his new companion's waited and cracked it slightly.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-23*

Nokri was smug in her fancy new attire that fluttered majestically in the wind. It was a wonderful shade of blue that complemented her eyes and the fabric was incredibly soft. She loved it. The princess was so wonderful. *The rich really are amazing,* she marveled. *Even their clothes are vastly different. I need money.* As they forged ahead inconspicuously Nokri would occasionally twirl self-satisfactorily. Her hair was once again tied up into its usual braids, this time kept in place with neat ribbons instead of cheap thread.

Desii seemed paranoid. Nokri slapped her on the shoulder and whispered "relax!" This was her idea, after all. The girl needed to take a chill pill and not be so uptight. Stress is unhealthy. "Want me to knock on the door?" she joked with deadpan sarcasm, raising a fist as though she was going to pound on the door. Instead, it opened slightly. Nokri waved. *Can we go in now?*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

This entire situation has the the hairs on the back of Aldus’ neck standing on end. Something bad was going on here, and it's not just the looming black buildings and religious fanaticism. Eraia suddenly being interested in Calorian light mages? They had been at a stalemate with Calora for years and everyone knew that Eraia was just as likely as Dreca to back down from a dispute… as in not likely at all.

Unlike the others Adlus has no doubt the Enera here is the Enera they are looking for - too many coincidences to be well, a coincidence. Still, standing in front of an Erain monastery with the others is making him uneasy. It doesn't feel like the lightest of approaches given their numbers, but he isn't one to argue.

“I suppose if this all goes south we can simply do what we best and run like hell, ha haha” He chuckles nervously in a bad attempt to take the edge off the evening as they await a reply at the door. The wait itself even seems a little off. The princess seemed well invested in this situation and he doubt she would be late for her queue.

Desii seems even more nervous then himself but the woman has proven to be quite the jumpy one, and this wasn't exactly a friendly visit. Nokri on the other hand was giddy with some unexplained excitement and it wouldn't surprise him to find out if she had had a few drinks before coming out tonight. 

Eventually the door opens a crack to reveal a very stern faced Lt. Faun looking absolutely *thrilled* with their company. Perhaps him and princess were having some alone time? Between the way she calmed his actions yesterday, the stolen glances at dinner the night prior, and the warm smile he gave her this afternoon despite the cold manner he seems to display to everyone else it wasn’t hard to figure out what was going on there. Of course that did still leave this mystery of the kinly scent about the two of them, another close friend of theirs perhaps?  If they spending “quality time” together it would explain the lack of princess standing behind him if she were still getting dressed after being interrupted.* 

“Good evening SIr Faun” Aldus say courteously not wanting an awkward silence to cause even more discontent among the group.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

Having been called over to the group, Eliran prepared to greet them, but instead was cut short by a Desii saying Afina had something to say about Enera, _please tell me she was careful please tell me she was careful_ he silently hoped as Afina began to explain what happened.

--
After hearing Afina's story, and Desii's subsequent conclusion the Cardinal was guily, Eliran had to comment, "Woh there you two, you guys need to slow down." He started before walking over to Afina and promptly bopping her on the head in chastising manner, "First of all what the hell were you thinking??? You basically told the man you were looking for a Calloran magician, even though you're being here training is a monumental event! Callorans training here beyond you is insane." 

He then turned to Desii and Aldus, "And what the hell were you two thinking???? Putting her up to this?" Eliran pointed at Afina, "This girl has barely left a study all her life she couldn't weasel information out of anything except for a literal book!” 
Eliran proceeded to massage his temple, “Do you know how dangerous the idea that Eraia kidnapped a Calloran child is? Do you know what kind of position a Princess in a nation that has been teetering on the edge of war and peace with her own land is in?” his words were coming out in a shouted whisper, as he had now gotten much closer to the two, “This diplomatic excursion can turn hostage in an instant if things go wrong! She doesn't even have other Callorans here to guard her!" he looked back at Elfriede, “no offense or anything.”  

“Sneaking into the Monastery is asinine at best,” He then looked at Afina, who was wearing a godforsaken look he knew from childhood. “Annnnd of course you’re going to do it anyways.” Eliran put a hand in his head, looking to anybody for support, but of course they were quiet, even the knight. “This is stupid and dangerous, and we’re betting on conjectures…” He sat down on a park bench with his hands in his heads, “lets hope we’re right, and if this plan works by some miracle….” he didn’t finish his thought.

--
Night had fallen, and Eliran stood at the front of the group along with Aldus. On his back his bow was carefully wrapped, and he had a small knife at his side. _Good god I can't believe I'm letting this happen._ He thought to himself, looking at an extremely nervous Desii, a very drecan looking Nokri, and Aldus. A clumsy mage, a potential spy, and a laguz walk into a church, it was like the begining of a bad joke, and Eliran didn't want to wait around long enough for the punch line. As they approached the door, all he said was "Lets get this done quick, and get out fast. Nobody wants to be caught sneaking into one of the holiest temples in Eraia."

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

The halls are, as expected, empty as you enter the building. The directions Afina gave earlier were straight forward, simple go to the hall staircase, go up to the second floor, first door on the right. As you walk down the hall you can here some Erain chants behind one closed door, and a late lecture behind another. It's enough to make you want to crouch, or walk on tip toes to be absolutely sure you don't make too much noise and alert the residents of the Monastery. 

While the main staircase's location in the center of the library make it populated even now, the hall staircase is quiet as a wine cellar. The second floor has less lights on than the first, late night activities taking place below. The lack of other noise makes your steps on the wood floors all the louder to you.

Desii cautiously walks up to the door in question, unadorned and closed tightly. She looks back to her companions and nods once before knocking very lightly. A thousand ways things could go wrong flash through her head, from it being the wrong door to Enera actually being a monsterous Drecian beast of war being kept illegally here. None of them come to pass, despite the sweat that forms on her brow as a soft voice calls from inside.

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

"Come in!" a girl's voice calls from behind the door. It's barely audible beyond the wooden door. Desii pushes open the door slowly on the command, stepping just into the door frame with it. The room is furnished in a rather utilitarian way, yet clearly decorated by a young child. Multiple bookshelves sit on the back right wall, a desk to their left in front of the window in the room. A bed rests on the left wall, and a dresser on the wall next to the door. The center of the room is clear, with what look like magic burns on the wood. The room looks equal parts dwelling, research study, and practice room. 

The decorations warm up the basic room, drawings (made with quill rather than crayon, oddly enough) of childish things like dragons and knights, trinkets, baubles and stuffed animals in great numbers. The owner of such possessions stands up from her desk, turning to face you with a hand on resting on the books that adorn the table. The 13 year old is every bit her age, from gangly limbs to awkward expression. She's dressed in simple while and purple clothing, very common attire in the monastery. Her short blonde hair has the bangs pulled back with a bright green ribbon which compliments her pretty green eyes. Her freckles are all the more prominent given how pale she is. Her smile, on the contrary, is bright and warm. 

On seeing your group the smile drops, replaced with a curious caution. "Hello. I haven't met you before, and you don't seem to be from the Monastery. Did the Cardinal send you over?" she asks. She seems comfortable despite the surprise, with a maturity beyond her looks.

"Saila wasn't kidding!" Desii says through a hearty exhale. "You really do have her eyes." Desii adds, giving an awkward wave to the girl. 

"I'm sorry, my name is Desii Manette. I happened on your parents in Mirashire, and they asked me to find you. Amazing we found you right as we entered the kingdom!" Desii starts to explain.

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

Enera's expression falls as she looks over Desii, a reserved frown on her face. "I'm... sorry, miss, but my parents died. Mirashire... burned down. I was the sole survivor of the attack, and Cardinal Raive took me in because of it. What... whatever anyone told you, it was in poor taste."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-26*

Elfriede grew increasingly agitated and worried with each passing step up to Enera’s room. So much so that he did not even notice when the girl open the door, slightly stunned by everyone's presence. Upon seeing the girl again he wasn’t sure if the girl even recognized him from their earlier tour. She gave off an odd mix of naivety and intelligence. He wasn’t sure if this girl really understood what was happening or … she understood just fine. 

When Dessi spoke. Elfriede raised an eyebrow at her recognition. He shook his head. *Its really none of my business… Moreover…. I must…* he looked back. Or rather, not something he was concerned about at present. His princess was still missing… 

“Im off to find the princess. I hope you found what you were looking for.” Faun bowed slightly to everyone in light of an apology and began walking down the hall toward the classrooms, uncaring if others followed.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-26*

As Elfriede lead them to Enera's room, the lack of Afina's presence became more and more notable, _She's not one to let something get in her way_ He thought, looking at Elfriede, noting his increasingly agitated stride, _he doesn't know where she is either..._ Eliran thought, now becoming mildly paranoid, _Where *is* she._ He pondered as they got to Enera's door, still lacking an Afina. 

Enera's comments didn't surprise him, it was the in her eyes. Those eyes weren't the eyes of a normal 13 year old girl, and Eliran pitied her. _She thinks that she's the only one left_ it was a sobering thought. Eliran looked to Faun as he prepared to storm off hunting Afina, conflicted on whether or not to follow the man. On one hand, he needed to protect Afina, but on the otherhand he had a sneaking suspicion that leaving his friends here alone may only lead to trouble. _Well at least Elfriede's going, plus this way theres no way to connect us with her anymore_ Eliran assured himself, only just barely trusting the knight enough to storm off into the distance without following him.

**Bill** - *2018-07-26*

"I would think not. Enera, return to your desk!" A voice barks from the doorway. The older man has hawkish features, narrow eyes that are accentuated by the wrinkles on his face and a slightly hooked nose. His hair is grey and he is clearly in his 60’s or older. He wears traditional robes of a Cardinal, and he carries a tome in his right hand. His steel grey eyes pierce through you and the frown on his face makes it very clear he's an unhappy man.

"Cardinal Raive! These people were sent by my parents Cardinal, Mama and Papa are still-" Enera says, standing up and smiling at the man.

"Quiet girl!" Raive barks again. Enera seems surprised by the outburst. "You cannot trust these people, they tell you I lie? Preposterous!"

"You're mistaken Cardinal, they know my parents, they told me-" Enera starts again.

"Enera, you shall be quiet." Raive says, the ice in his voice dropping the temperature in the room. Enera tenses up visibly, her arms wrapping around her shoulders again. 

"Why... are you not happy Cardinal?" she asks quietly, her green eyes locked on the Cardinal. The man scowls and lightly flips open his tome. 

"I suppose this is the greatest of tests my lady." he says. "Enera, your talent with light magic is unheard of. So unheard of in fact, that when I did I knew you must be one of two things; a demon in human guise... or the reincarnation of Lylalel herself." he says, thumbing through pages. Enera steps backward, supporting herself on the lip of her desk. She's clearly never heard this before.

"I, by every oath I have swore to the church and to my Goddess, cannot let a demon live on this plane. But your beauty, and your talent with something so pure as the magic of the Goddess... I had to know if you were indeed Lylalel reborn. It is my test of faith, my life has lead to this moment where I must make this judgment. Will you be our Lady of Light reborn, leading us to victory against the heathen religons of this world? Or are you a false god, an idol meant to sway our hearts from the Lady? Every lecture, every lesson, every spell cast and battle won. Each of them guide me in finding the truth."

"2 years I've observed you, and I truly do not know. I see Lylalel in you, in your eyes and smile. Yet here you are *clinging* to the earthly parents I pulled you from! This is... merely another test. A test fo *your* will, and of mine to support your true self. You may not have the willpower to stay and prove yourself as our Goddess... But I have the willpower to keep you from swaying." He looks up at the assembled room.

"You will not be leaving Enera. I shall either prove you a Goddess or slay you as the servant of Lyarlel you are. This shall be yet another test of *my faith and your true self; I shall remove those who try to sway you and purify you with your blessed light!*" Raive bellows and a spell launches from him. No words were spoken, no indicators made. 

A column of light rips up from the floor, spreading out like water. The light dances with highlights and dull spots interweaving, confusing your eyes as it spills over you. The light itself feels so pure and warm, yet painful and too clean for your senses to comprehend. Before your senses are overwhelmed entirely you hear the familiar words of spell craft. Light washes at you from behind, swelling against the rotating and dizzying wall, sphere, ever changing attack from the Cardinal. The sensory overload forces you to cover your eyes as everything suddenly goes dark with the force of a bang.

Desii, Nokri and Aldus fly backwards, only they don't hit the wall of the Monastery. Instead they fly out the now destroyed back wall, falling a story to the ground among the rubble of what was once the wall that kept Enera in. Enera herself is on the rim of the once room, resting on one knee with a tome balanced on her front leg. She's broken out in a heavy sweat and is panting heavily. Next to her is Eliran, who hit one of the few remaining pieces of the wall and didn't fly out in the blast. 

Each of you feel fine, though possibly a little nauseous from the light show. Those on the ground can just barely see Morras step forward, also unharmed from the blast. His tome is at the ready and his eyes are alight with a fervor that shakes you to your very core. 

"Interlopers. I am Cardinal Morras Raive of Trisp, leader of the most advanced Light Magic study in the world and decorated general of the Eraian army. I shall slay you in the name of Lylalel, to protect her reborn self and punish you for your attempts at corrupting her. In her name I pray."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-30*

_This is why I hate the super religious_ Eliran thought to himself listening to the Cardinal drone on. As the man continued his rant, Eliran fingered the bag he brought on his back, containing the ammunition and bow he had prepared in case something went wrong. He glanced to Aldus, hoping to see the laguz also preparing to abscond, until he heard the Cardinals words...
"... _your blessed light!_" 
A light enveloped the room and Eliran was thrown against the wall... or what was left of it. Groaning slightly he noticed only he and Enera remained. _Shit_ was his only thought as the man started to blabber about position or something. he glanced in Enera's direction, _well at least she's on our side_ 
Eliran looked around, spotting a tome by his feet. Quickly he grabbed it with his left hand, opening to a random page as he carefully slipped an arrow into his other hand. Meeting the Cardinal's eyes, Eliran mimicked the garbled language many mages use when spellcasting. Partway through his chant, Eliran suddenly launched towards the man, pushing the tomb from his hand into the mans face, letting out an outcry to make it sound like he had just finished a spell. Using his momentum, Eliran took another step towards the man and put his weight behind the arrow in his right hand, stabbing it into the mans gut.  _Not enough_ Eliran thought to himself as he continued his attack, not wanting to give the man a second. _I need to get the book out of his hands_ Eliran kicked at Raive's solar plexis with his left foot and swung his free hand at the tomb, hoping that it would be enough to disarm the man.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

Aldus watches as the young Enera tries to make sense of the idea that her parents are still alive. Someone has clearly done a lovely job of messing up the girls perspective on her situation, judging by the confusion in her eyes. He looks on as Desii comforts the child, calming her enough to want her to go with them. Aldus smiles at the image, idly thinking Desii would make quite the mother herself if she so wished to one day. A weight begins to lift as he thinks now their only task is to get back out of here with no one noticing. 

Before that weight can actually leave his chest though, the door bursts open revealing an very angry old man, clearly a high ranking member of the Erain clergy. He commands Enera in the voice of a man who thinks he holds absolute power. It’s apparent the girl thinks highly of this man, as she tried to share her joy with him only to be shot down by a string of religious nonsense. He enters an almost fanatical rage declaring Erena’s divinity and power as the Erain goddess herself. A shiver runs itself down Aldus spine as the man expresses how beautiful and bright this young girl is. A young girl of 13 being almost worshiped buy a man over 60 years old.

Aldus’s lip pulls back over one side of his teeth in disgust at this fanatic. He plays off the groups efforts to return a kidnapped child as a test of her faith and godly-ness, preposterous doesn't even begin to Describe it. This kind of fanaticism can quickly prove infectious, and fatal to opposers, which is the part they will now be playing it seems. The man raises his arms and forces light like nothing Aldus has ever seen to flood the room in an instant. 

He stumbles back, his emerald eyes burning with new intensity he’s never encountered, he feels like the sun itself is in front of him. He doubles over as an earth-shattering bang resounds off the walls around him. Walls he cannot see because his eyes are shut, and his hands are over them. Walls that… apparently don’t exist anymore, he realises in a panicked state as hes flung back much further than should be possible. His heart nearly stops as he launched off the second floor where Enera’s room is, and down about 10 feet into the monastery courtyard. His instincts tell him to protect his head, he tries his best not to tense up as he falls. Miraculously, Aldus lands in a row of bushes edging the courtyard and rolls backwards of off it ending up on his feet.

He frantically reaches to his back “Please dont be broken, please dont be broken” He panics as he lifts his bow of his back, unscathed. He sighs at the very small victory and tries to steady his mind enough to fight back. His eyes finish adjusting to the sudden light change just as Morras makes his introduction. The man exudes confidence and power. Every hair on Aldus neck stands at attention, his canine ear drops significantly and his tail drops between his legs. He’s never faced someone like this before. Hell, he’s ran from pretty much everyone thats opposed him since getting to the mainland. His lip quivers as he frantically looks around for the others.

Nokri and Desii are both down here also. He prays to the ancestors that Nokri wont pass out *again* as she has a habit of doing. His faith in Desii’s abilities is a little more confident. Eliran is up top still it seems alongside Enera who looks ready to attack the cardinal? Or at least not outright fight them. Come to think of it shouldn't that spell have hurt more? Not that he knows alot about light magic. But… she obviously isn’t quite fond of being taken for a goddess by a crazy religious zealot.

Eliran, on the other hand seems completely unfearing of this over-powered light mage. Eliran spouts some magic sounding nonsense before driving an arrow into the man and kicking at him hard. A distraction opportunity?  It would seem this is enough to knock Aldus out of his scared state and inspire him enough to make for an attack. A tall, study tree is rooted near to where he currently stands. Aldus runs at the tree, launching himself off the trunk and landing in a sturdy branch. It’s not exactly the height of the second floor but it allows him a much better vantage point for shooting. He grabs the arrows and stuffs two between his teeth, knocking the last one and firing at Morras’s side. He knocks another and pulls back harder this time, biting down on the remanding arrow in his effort to fire with the most force possible. He knocks the third but doesn't fire immediately, taking a moment to assess the situation.

“We have to get her away from him… or.. Or something!” Aldus says, thinking out loud. “I knew there was something strange about his place. How many others here are harboring these types of thoughts? And if others are as mad as Morras then….  where is the princess?!” his heart sinks as he comes to the very likely conclusion that the princess wasn't simply having some evening fun earlier. With that he lets his last arrow fly with more power than either of the first two, gritting his teeth hard in anxiety.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-02*

Nokri gazed at the squirt sitting all pampered in her room. When she heard the girl was kidnapped she assumed they'd have her branded and chained to a wall in the basement. Not... this. Despite the girl being very cute with her freckles and ribbon, *decent fashion choices I suppose,* Nokri held contempt for this little girl. *Lets just hurry up and get this over with.* She stood back, letting the charismatic folk do their thing while gazing at the scribbles on the wall. She was never very good with kids. They scream too much about pain that doesn't really hurt, and are so stupid. Funny to watch but not interact with.

"Hey," Nokri whispered, tapping Eliran on the back. "Do we have anybody keeping wat-"
Speaking of the devil, a priest rolled up into the room. He was a little angry. After a few extremely welcoming works which showed just how much the priest appreciated them being there, they were enveloping in a bright light and sent blasting out of the room. It was like having someone shine a flashlight in your face, or waking up after someone drew back the curtains too quickly and let in too much light, but way worse. Nokri managed to land in a patch of clover and rolled over some, softening her fall enough to bruise rather than break. She quickly hurried to her feet and dusted off her dress, checking for tears or permanent stains. She was mad.

"Did the girl fall down here?" she shouted, looking around. Apparently not, unless she was obliterated by the light or ran off in the last 60 seconds. The other two had already sprung into action, but Nokri was quite defenseless. She hitched up the dress, tying it up to make maneuvering easier and vowing to steam out the wrinkles later. Scattered here and there was glass from what used to be the bedroom window. Nokri picked up some hefty, pointy shards that would work nicely as a knife and stuck them under the tied-up portion of dress which now acted like a bag. With a nice pointed shard in one hand she dashed towards the monastery entrance. With the commotion now going on, she hoped that security at the entrance was probably a little more lax than usual, and tried to push her way through the door with little care for anyone behind it.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-08-02*

Elfriede sat at the foot of the bed on the floor with his face in his hands mulling over all that had happened and what he should do next. His breathing was heavy and off rhythm. The knight lieutenant had been hyperventilating just moments before. 
The ground suddenly shook accompanied by a loud bassy sound that sounded akin to grinding or maybe an explosion. It suddenly hit him that the sound came from the wing where he left his new unlikely companions. 
“*No..*” Faun said half defeated. He couldn’t take much more of the night. He even debated taking Afina and running in his sorry emotional state. But the knight lieutenant shook his head. Even in his state he could never bring himself to be that level of stupidly selfish. 

Elfriede reached over and lifted the serene yet pained looking princess onto his back, grabbing her legs as support and leaning forwards, propping her head on his shoulder. Even just looking at her face pained him, he continuously kept remember her expression after.... He snapped his head away and readjusted her.

“I’ll find someone to help you Afina..” He said although not really believing his own words, he felt as if it would comfort her somehow, but it might have been more meant for himself. But realistically he needed help… plus there was the fact of the rumble he just heard. He needed to find the group. 

With as determined of a look as he could possibly muster Elfriede Faun walked out of the room and down the hall towards the group with Princess Afina Tyndall on his back. He felt her breath on his neck, warm but staggered. *Poison?!* Faun walked all the faster to return to them. There was nothing he could do on his own.

As he reached the end of the hall he began to see natural light from the moon puke into the hallway. He squinted a scrutinizing glance at the light and proceed around the final corner. Faun’s eyes widened in awe at the source. The now huge hole on the second floor in Enera’s room leading outside. The Knight approached cautiously and quietly hearing muttering inside.
He swallowed hard and peaked into the room. “....No!....” He whispered to himself as his eyes widened again. “I thought it was over…”
Faun gripped his rapier shakily. 

(author’s notes: Actually the worst fucking night ever.)

Desii loses herself in the spellwork of Morras and Enera. Foolishly she tries to see the magic interact and it causes her to involuntarily grasp at her eyes in pain. Her skin tingles with the energy she's surrounded by, sheer and harsh and pure, before it's suddenly replaced with a vacuum of cold night air. 

Desii shrieks as she tumbles through the air, eyes tightly closed from the bright light and fear of falling combined. She at the least manages to get her arms up to protect her head as she slams into the ground. She slides along the ground, rather than rolling like a veteran combatant would do. It tears up the side of her hip cape entirely, white fabric flitting about in her wake. Indeed, most of her right side is tattered and torn up, dirt caking into the newly found holes in fabric. Even her pants, made of a heavier, leather based material, start to thin. 

For better or worse, Desii slams into a tree in the courtyard. Her curled up form breaks as her back takes the brunt of it, arching as if her head and feet intended to continue without her torso. The young mage slumps, tears streaming down her dirtied face. The only think that encourages her to break from defeated position she's found herself in is that the man who did this to her wants to do the same to Enera.

Desii blinks through the tears, slowly coming to her feet while favoring her left side. She tries to take stock of the battlefield, seeing Aldus's tail hanging from a branch in a nearby tree and Nokri running for the monastery entrance. Enera is nowhere to be found at first and Desii's heart clams up her chest before she spots Eliran defending the younger girl, still in the room far above them. Desii silently blesses Eliran for being able to stay with the girl, giving her some form of protection. Adrenline courses through Desii, and she makes for the edge of the building. 

"Enera! Jump down, it's not safe up there!" Desii shouts over the din of battle. The brunette has both of her hands free, her tome still stowed in her dusty pack, and motions upwards in an 'I'll catch you' motion.

**Bill** - *2018-08-02*

Enera's breath comes to her fast and shallow, her eyes wide at the scene before her as she sits on her knees by the once wall. She had just counter attacked her mentor, her savior! And damneditall it felt right to the young girl, the Morras Raive before her was not the man she knew. Whether this is the true Cardinal or something had happened to the man, Enera wouldn't stand for attack these people who've come to her with such wonderful news!

The bard rushes past her, engaging the Cardinal in hand to hand combat. Enera raises her tome, ready to assist before her mind completely blanks. In the spur of the moment it was one thing to attack the Cardinal, the spell flew to her lips without conscious thought. Now, to make the choice? Enera's tome quivered in her hand. She tries to think, to express any of the cloud of thoughts that whirl around her mind like a cyclone, but the only sounds to come out of her mouth are unintelligible stutters.

"Enera! Jump down, it's not safe up there!" rings out from below, the voice of the mage girl from before. Part of Enera notes that she, and all the others with the bard, were no longer in the room while the rest of her twists around to look over the side. The youth looks at the green eyes of the mage, but can't seem to process the girl's words as she sits there.

Morras shouts out in pain as the young man still in the room slams his own tome into his face. Not a moment after the man stabs something into his gut, cause Morras to sputter and fall to a knee in agony. The spell comes to him on auto pilot, pages of his tome burning away as the Cardinal sets his state of mind through the pain in his stomach. 

A cylinder of light expands out from the Cardinal, forcing Eliran back lest he burn from the strange incarnation of pure light before him. The cylinder stops expanding as it reaches a good few yards in width and flares once. The pillar suddenly breaks, as if it were made of stacked rings rather than a solid form. The rings launch forward, swarming into Eliran and Enera. The rings sear through the two, leaving the spots where the rings hit numb from pain.

The Cardinal is once again standing after the attack, appearing from the center of the spell. More pages burn from his book at a column of light appears just outside of the room, mere inches from landing directly on Desii's head. With an angry swipe of his hand, the base of the pillar of light becomes like liquid gold, melting down and flowing about the courtyard below. The top begins to rock, it's base unstable, falling towards the tree Aldus has taken roost in.

Morras's face sets as a third spell comes into being. Helixes of light twist into existence all over the room, combining and merging into twisted columns. It's impossible to see where one strand begins and the other ends, the light emanating from the spell seems to distort the natural light of the moon, preventing you from focusing. They twist and turn their way to ceiling height, the center of the column tightening as if the strands knotted in the center. Morras heaves once, and the columns explode wildly at his thought. The strands fly about wildly, anchored only by the center knots. The once top and bottom of the helixes flail about like the end of a whip, destroying anything they touch. They wildly tear through the room, the onces close to Eliran and Enera slapping the two with the pure force of light magic. Morras watches on as the strands turn the room into a death trap, smirking and keeping the spell going with a lifted hand. 

"This is the type of power you've chosen to play with, foolish boy. And the power you shall have once you awaken as your true self Enera." He says through the storm of light whipping about. Your mobility is gone, any direction you go in the room has a knot covering that area with it's whips.

(ooc: Special notes for this combat:

You may defend Enera and roll dice to that effect. When you do, it adds to her own defense dice pool. 

Enera dropping is bad, but *not* a game over. Morras getting a hold of the dropped Enera is though.

The snap out of it goal can be rolled for when you help Enera get over attacking her own mentor and that her own mentor would attack her. This can be via words or action. )

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-09*

Nokri bolted up the steps, muttering annoyed utterances at herself. A few scared members of the church called out to her, but no one stopped her or pursued. Dull thuds and shouting could be heard from behind the thick stone walls, and all she had to do was follow those sounds. *But where are the stairs?* Nokri had paid very little attention when they entered, and now found herself lost despite knowing exactly where she needed to be.

She stuck her head in a few doorways, hoping to see stairs or a ladder within. A group of shaken nuns was huddled up in the kitchen and her in most concerned voice, Nokri said "You all should run along, something frightful is happening upstairs! It's not safe here." She repeated the same for every rogue person she came across just sitting in their room. One frantic man who was feverishly praying tried to bring all of his belongings and nearly tripped with an armful of junk as he tried to run out of the room. Nokri sternly said "just leave it and run," after the fifth time he dropped something. They were wasting too much time and Nokri wanted to get back quickly. As he scurried down the hall, Nokri looked at the item he dropped. *A tome?* It was a fancy book, potentially worth something of value. *Jackpot.* He wouldn't notice this was missing for now, right?

Finally at the end of the hall were stairs, Nokri climbed them and arrived on the top floor out of breath. *You have* got *to be kidding me.* Mr. Knight was standing there dumbfounded while literal chaos was happening inside what once was the bedroom. "What happened?" she shouted, white with rage at seeing an unconscious princess. The knight looked ready to jump into the fray with his hand on his sword, but no way could that happen with an injured girl on his back. Nokri wrestled the princess away from her knight, putting her old upper body muscles to work and careful not to bump Afina against the sharp bundle of glass she was carrying. Afina was unconscious but still alive, and wordlessly Nokri dragged her away from the crazy battle, about 2 rooms away on the other side of the hall. That should be a wide enough buffer zone for now.

*What happened? What did this?* Nokri wondered as she checked the princess's breath and heart rate. Both were slow.  Her skin was clammy and she had a cold sweat. Nokri softly opened an eyelid, the princess's eyes were dilated. She found no abundance of mucus, but noticed Afina's breath was... sweet? *Was she drugged?* Whatever it was, the toxins in her body had to go. Now. Nokri stuttered for a moment. She had no tools, and no medicine with her aside from some useless plants. Nothing to siphon out blood or get her in a stable condition. *I could try dark magic,* she entertained, but there was nothing to sacrifice and no guarantee it wouldn't backfire horribly. Nokri dug out the book she swiped earlier, flipping through it. Many pages were illegible chickenscratch, but several pages had spells. This was indeed a magic tome. Flipping through wildly, Nokri finally came across something that might help. Some religious mumbo-jumbo about expelling impurities from the body. That should work for drugs, yeah?

Nokri cast the spell over the princess then dropped the book and turned her on her side should she begin expelling from the mouth. The body shut down to protect her from the toxins, so assuming the spell worked the princess should eventually regain consciousness. Nokri steadily held her hand, keeping track of Afina's heartbeat for any improvement.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

```
Afina remembered standing behind her mother as she looked on at the newcomer. His dark hair and gray eyes were unnatural for a Callorian; Most Laerans had blues eyes, at the minimum. He walked slowly yet purposefully, a book clutched in his hands. “Your Majesty,” she said, bowing his head to the queen, before turning his gaze to Afina. The young girl froze, clutching the edges of her dress tightly in her hands. Her blue eyes examined the stranger, and for a moment, neither dared breathe. 

Gracefully, the stranger bent to one knee. “Princess,” she said, nodding his head respectfully. “I am Carya Witella of Eraia. Your mother says I am to be your tutor. Is this correct?” 

Afina looked up to her mother, who raised an eyebrow, making it clear that the decision was up to the young princess. The girl turned her attention back to the man in front of her. She examined his uncommon features, and foreign dress. He wore a white tunic, and black pants. Silver greaves adorned his legs, and similar bracers protected his forearms. He wore no chestplate; Instead, a vest of Laeran blue was firmly secured with a black belt around his waist. She peered at the book that the man held to his breast. He followed her gaze.

“This? These are light tomes. I do not…” Witella glanced between Queen Leora and Afina. “...yet know if you shall follow the path of the light. But in coming here I promised to give my knowledge to you in defense of the house of Tyndall.” He offered the book to Afina and the small princess began to reach out for it.

And suddenly, the memory was no longer Afina’s to relive. She kept reaching for the book, and yet it still seemed out of her grasp. She stumbled forward to catch it, and some unknown force held her back nonetheless. Tears brimmed in her eyes as she was drawn further and further from her tutor, and she reached to feel her cheeks. They seemed to fall sideways, cutting brave paths across her cheeks, over her nose, and into her hairline. 
```

The princess woke with a start, stomach churning and head spinning. She leaned over to gag, and foul yellow liquid dribbled down her chin. Cheeks still moist, Afina wiped her chin with the back of her arm before turning to look about the room. She was in an abandoned classroom, dim with only the light of a candle burning of the windowsill. Memories came reeling back… _the Bishop! Elfriede! Elfriede..._ she thought, looking about the room. Her eyes landed on Nokri, head cocked with concern and worry. 

“Nokri! I… where is the bishop? Elfriede?” she demanded, aggression creeping into her tone in her confused state. She squeezed her eyes shut, shaking her head. “Nevermind that, I--” she began, before a sudden rumble shook the room, originating from across the hall. The princess stood fast, head swimming and knees buckling as she moved. Nokri hurried to her aid, insisting that the Laeran rest, and that the matters across the hall were of no concern to her. Nonetheless, Afina pushed on, pushing through a battered door to see the rubble of what was once a bedroom in front of her. She leaned against the doorframe as she took in the sight. 

Eliran stood bravely, bow drawn, shielding the girl that she had spied earlier. The young girl had her tomes open, gaze fearful but firm as she directed herself towards the man in the center of the room. There stood the Cardinal, bearing a similar crazed yet powerful look that Torin had borne only moments earlier. Eyes trailing across the room, Afina also spotted Elfriede, who had seemed to poise himself for the stealth attack. Afina spotted a light tomes open on the ground, and nodded for Nokri to grab it, as she leaned against the frame. 

“Cardinal…?” Afina said, stupefied. _Why are they fighting the strongest light mage in Aurii? What has he done? Is Eraia… not to be trusted?_

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-13*

As Eliran managed to shank the Cardinal, the only warning he got for the oncoming spell was a glimpse of determination in the mans eyes before a sudden cylinder of light eradiated from the man. As he felt his arms begin to burn Eliran hopped back as far as he could. After getting just out of range of the strange pillar Eliran relaxed a little.

But it was to soon for comfort. As the pillar fell apart into rings Eliran gave a short cry as one hit his knee, causing the usually mobile man to fall into another ring, which struck his gut with what might be some form of cruel irony. 

With a groan Eliran could only watch the Cardinals magic spring forth, slowly turning the room into an odd death trap. As the vines of light spread around the room, he saw one of the whips swing towards Enera, and pushing off his one good leg he launched himself to the girl, pushing her out of the way and feeling it lash against his back. _Kist that hurts_ Eliran groaned as he leaned up to look at Enera, "You ok?" He asked, looking at the shell-shocked girl.

He turned back to look at the Cardinal as the man gloated, "...type of power you've chosen to play with, foolish boy.  And the power you shall have once you awaken as your true self Enera." Eliran had to admit, this was a pretty shitty situation, and foolish would be the exact way he'd describe it too. He looked around, trying to think of a plan, as he knew one bad move could get them whipped or trapped in another spell. 

As he glanced around Eliran realized while the whips were restricting them, their purpose was defensive, to prevent him from getting in close, a grin started to form in his mind. Distance was the best thing for him as well, and there was still one way out. He looked to Enera, the poor girl was small, and while she had sounded mature earlier, her young age was apparent. Eliran grabbed her shoulders, shaking her slightly, "I need you to trust us and jump" He said, "Jump down to Desii, she'll catch you" Eliran silently hoped that Desii's drive to help the girl would beat her natural clumsiness.  "I'll try and distract him so you can do it, so when I say 'Go' you need to jump. Understand?" he said it with a bit more emphasis, looking for confirmation in the girls eyes.

As Eliran saw what he hoped was understanding, he faced the Cardinal again, this time pulling out his bow off his back. As he put his hands on the grips, he could feel the wood still warm with the heat of the light magic that had struck him before. Grimacing as he drew his shot, Eliran nooked two arrows, aiming to strike the Tomb and Morris's face, "Ready..." He spoke to Enera, still looking at the cardinal, "set..." His shot was set, "_GO!_" He cried out, releasing the arrows at the man.

Desii dives to the side as a column of light magic drops from the sky, tripping over her own two feet onto the ground just outside the spell. She doesn't have time to sigh in relief when the bottom of the pillar begins to melt away, seeping towards her like molten fire in the forge. Desii shrieks, scrambling to her feet and looking for higher ground. 

Her panic causes her limited athletic skills to fail her. Desii stumbles again, her right arm slipping into the spell's effect. She screeches in pain, rolling away and desperately trying to blink away the tears so she could see where she was going. Her breath is ragged by the time she gets to a large chunk of what was once Enera's wall, climbing over it and sobbing on her knees as the spell, nearly upon her again, starts to fade.

The young mage tries to calm her breathing and let the panic in her subside. It takes her a moment, an eternity in combat, but she's able to open her eyes and look for Enera on the side of the wall again. She sees Eliran encouraging Enera to jump down, and the lump in Desii's stomach knows she'll have to go back onto the ground. The ground that not a moment ago brought her more pain that she could ever imagine. Eliran stands, presumably to challenge the Cardinal again, and Desii knows she has to move. She crosses the courtyard, waving to Enera while frantically checking for any more of the torturous golden light. 

"Enera, please! You aren't safe up there!" Desii calls, a small voice in the back of her mind calling her a fool for bringing Enera down near the molten light. Enera looks down to Desii and Desii feels strength course through her. Enera is tearful and her confusion is all over her face, her world crumbling around her and Desii knew what that feeling was like. 

"We'll get through this together Enera, just come down! I'm not going anywhere; I promised Saila and Dain!" Desii tries again, hoping the name of Enera's parents will encourage the girl to move.

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

Morras smirks, letting his swath of writhing deflect Eliran's arrows.

"Your efforts are pointless, thief. You shall no more take my pupil from me than you will defeat me in combat." he says to the young bard. Suddenly Morras hears his title from behind him, in a terribly familiar voice. He looks aside, one eye still watching the bard, to see Afina Tyndall in the hall, with her guardian knight nearby and looking ready for a fight.

"Lady Tyndall, you shouldn't be here. My apologies for having this dangerous scenario occur during your visit; it appears some hooligans are trying to kidnap my apprentice. Needless to say, this upset me greatly as she is mine to protect. Please retreat to the library, I shall have this resolved soon." he says, watching Eliran the entire time. Morras then motions at the bard with a shake of his head.

"Sir knight, if you would? These heathens wish to deprive Lylalel of one of her strongest servants; may they repent in the next life." he says; the latter phrase a traditional execution statement from the church. 

Pages then begin to burn from Morras's tome. The man's narrowed eyes guide his magic, the knots and vines of magic slowing down and spreading out straight from the center knot. These pinwheels of magic begin to spin, and a ring forms from the extended tips of the vines. These wagon wheel shaped manifestations begin to spin forward, floating towards the Elbian as the build up to a speed fast enough the eye can no longer track the spokes of the wheel.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-08-15*

Faun heard a muffled words from nearby but his gaze was arrested by the destruction of the room and the Cardinal. His expression looked all to familiar. He gritted his teeth hard and finally grasped his sword. He was about to begin to walk forward when suddenly he was being pulled on… or rather, a load was being taken from him.

He turned to see another disgruntled blonde snatching the princess away from him. He was going to protest, but Nokri seemed fully capable in the moment. He stared at the girl dumbfounded as she began her “work”. The princess was in already terrible shape. Her breathing was off, beads of sweat rolled off her forehead. Perhaps it’s better that he allows her to take care of her. He had other difficult matters to attend to. Nokri suddenly withdrew a familiar bound tome. A wave of relief fell over Elfriede, and appreciation… and guilt. 


He looked down at Nokri and nodded even though she wasn't looking at him. “Thank you… you are truly kind...” Elfriede looked back up to the Cardinal and began to proceed towards the room cautiously. He spotted Eliran attempting to assist the young girl Enera, whom oddly seemed to fully trust him. “Something is off..” he whispered to himself. He understood that his companions were right. This whole monastery seemed completely off. Leave people alone with a doctrine long enough and they might begin to interpret them anyway they want. This town was poisoned. There was no light of Lylalel here, just power-perverted men.

He realized he hadn't seen Desi or Aldus, he glanced at the broken wall in which Morras occasionally glanced outside. *They must be outside.* Suddenly after a few moments, apparently aware of his presence, the Cardinal turned to address him and ...the princess? He glanced sidelong and back at the woman standing there with a somewhat shaky stance. He felt waves of embarrassment wash over him as he glimpsed her face. Their eyes locked only briefly, just long enough for him to glimpse the expression on her face. She wasn’t looking at him with the same eyes that she used to. They were clouded with doubt. He elected to look away, biting back any emotion in the moment, ...back to the clouded self-righteous Cardinal casually giving him orders. 


Elfriede grimaced at the man. “Only high servants of Lylalel are qualified to order me around Sir Morras.” Addressing him intentionally with a title that was **not** Cardinal. He clicked his sword just a small bit out of its sheath. While turning his attention to the vines of light that sprawled around the room. “Your servant Torin already proved to me that much.” Faun gritted his teeth once more to hold his frustration. He felt the pressure of his larger than normal canines press hard against his lower teeth. Which reminded him of what he was, and what he did to Torin. He had killed a high official of Lylalel. Whether or not the good lady actually supported that man… is another matter.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-15*

A wave of relief washed over Afina as Elfriede met her gaze. He seemed embarrassed, and ashamed. _Rightfully so,_ she thought. He shied away, turning to address the Cardinal. _Dropping a formal title, he knows better than that,_ Afina thought, as Nokri thrust the tomes from the ground into Afina's hands. _Even still, it's a comfort to know that he's only a liar, and not a traitor as well_. The princess's gazed flickered throughout the room, and it seemed as if time had slowed down. 

Bright pinwheels of light manifested themselves in front of the Cardinal. Elfriede's sword clicked out of its sheathe, as he prepared to draw. Enera hid behind Eliran, as he bravely faced the violent Cardinal. Nokri stood at Afina's side, her own blue attire making the princess feel a sense solidarity with the other young woman. She would properly thank Nokri later. 

Afina's hands numbly grazed the tomes; Should she attack the Cardinal here, Callora and Eraia would most definitely be one step closer to war. A princess of a prominent Callorian nation, attacking the highest ranking religious figure in the Eraian church... it was political suicide. Afina had come for her own advancement, and for the good of her people. What good would Laera get from her attacking the Cardinal? She hesitated, mouth open as fear prevented her from moving. And if she didn't do anything, Eliran would take the full force of the Cardinal's assault. Eliran, her first friend, her best friend, and even though he had neglected to write, the closest thing she had to family besides her own blood.

The violent pinwheels flew towards the merchant man with astounding speed, and Afina could feel her stomach drop. "Nokri, arm yourself!" the princess instructed, her free hand pointing towards the tomes littered about the floor. In an instant, the feeble weakness of the drugs seemed to have left the Laeran's body as adrenaline flooded her veins. She wasn't sure she knew who Elfriede was anymore, but he was still her escort. She could trust him to provide a solid assault on the Cardinal, despite his Eraian heritage.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

With her patient now up and running about, Nokri clenched her teeth and followed. She wasn't going to be the one to blame if the princess collapsed again, but she wasn't exactly in a position to tell royalty to sit down and stay put.
The tide of battle certainly seemed in their favor now that Afina was at the forefront, what with the fancy lightshow now going on.

Immediately reacting to orders, Nokri gripped one of her glass shards. It would be hard to move quickly with all of them in her dress. Seeing an opening, she snapped it in half and threw it towards the Cardinal's feet, followed by another few shards broken in a similar fashion, and small chips of glass. Her goal was to surround him with enough pointy glass that his movement would be hindered.

A grating voice was heard from outside, Desi calling for the girl to jump. Why was Enera just standing there? Move it or lose it, there was enough freaky magic flying around now that it's a wonder the floor hadn't given out. *We just have to get the girl, right?* Nokri decided. She ducked and ran towards Enera, hoping to grab the girl or at least bump her out of the way and maybe outside the window.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

Those of Aldus's arrows that reach their intended target go unnoticed by him as he blinks in confusion at the Cardinal’s ever evolving attack. He is stunned briefly by the sight of magic he doesn't comprehend, rendering him helpless for a few moments.  Above he can see Sir Faun and 2 blonde figures, indicating the safety of the princess and also Nokri's re-emergence after disappearing moments ago. 


With only Desii on the same level as him, he jumps down from his perch and makes his way over to her. Enera stands nervously above seeming to falter on the edge of jumping (hopefully) to safety or staying up above. 


Determining that he would be better suited for the task of catching Enera’s weight than Desii, or at least with his help, he calls up to Enera. 


“Enera please come down! I will catch you! I will ensure you don't get hurt, you'll be safer down here with us. We will get you away from danger. Come! The sooner you jump down the sooner we can return you to your true family!”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-16*

As the Cardinal droned on yet again, Eliran hoped for some back up. He  didn't want to admit it but the Cardinal had a point. Fighting him alone without magic was madness, but still here he was.  _does he ever shut up_ Eliran wondered, closely watching the man and all the light constructs around him.  _Enera and I need to go..._ He glanced at the ledge again, if he grabbed her and they both jumped...

"...Lady Tyndall, you shouldn't be here..." At the mention of Afina Eliran's eyes shot to the entrance where she stood, and as he took in her ragged appearance a flame of rage lit his eyes. _What the hell happened to her_ were his only thoughts as he looked for the knight, who stood closer to the Cardinal, _I knew I couldn't trust him to take care of her._ Eliran berated himself for not following Elfriede earlier.  

".... May they repent in the next life." The filth had finally finished drowning. _He's in the way_ Eliran thought annoyed. Afina, for all her annoyances and harping about 'writing letters' was Eliran's oldest friend, and while he wouldn't openly admit it, a reminder of what it was like to have a sister again. _And **they** hurt her_  The Eraian church had never commanded much respect from Eliran, but this was the final straw. Not only had they kidnapped a young girl and employed bandits, but now they had hurt his family as well.  

“You bastard” Eliran spit out the word, unleashing a flurry of arrows at the _trash_ that stood across the room as he rolled across the floor, trying to close in on the man while dodging his still remaining whips. Unfortunately with each arrow he released, Eliran could feel the strain the battle was starting to have, and he was finally tripped by one of the whips lashed at his feet. Crashing to the floor, Eliran looked towards Morris, unable to dodge as one of the wagon wheel-esque light construct swung and struck him across his entire core. Letting out a large ‘Oof’ Eliran was left mildly dazed and on the ground.

Today was really not his day.

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

Enera is terrified, inching her way towards the side of the wall with all the motivation of a tortoise racing the hair. Some part of her still holds her tome in hand, close to her chest like a safety blanket. She no longer looks to her mentor and once savior Raive, instead her eyes are firmly locked on the edge, the escape from the room she's spent the last years of her life in. If only she had the will power to move faster...!

Desii jolts as Aldus comes up beside her, outstretching his arms to catch Enera when she jumps. Desii hesitates for only a moment before entrusting the rescue of the girl to her wolfen ally. Aldus was... responsible, if quiet. She knew he wouldn't give up Enera. It was an aura the Naissankari gave off, one that radiated compassion for his fellow man. As foolish as it was to trust a young girl's life to a feeling, Desii felt... confident, in Aldus. She just knew Aldus would put Enera's life above his own, simply because that's who he was. 

Desii jogs backwards, cracking open Danthres's tome. If she were to battle spell craft with a Cardinal in the Eraian church, she would need to play with spells at his left. Danthres was a potion maker more than anything else, but his few spell were said to embody chaos. 

Desii reads the spell quickly, refreshing herself on the mental state she needs to be in. It's easy for her, as the state for the spell requires that of the loyal dog, the dog that waits day after day for it's master's return. Desii imagines it as Enera, waiting and waiting for the rescue she didn't know she had coming. Words come to her lips and she raises the tome towards the room above.

Wind swirls around Desii, the tips of her hair whipping the nape of her neck. She lets the wind build, knowing the longer she stands firm the more wind will spring from the point she chooses at the release of the magic. If she can get enough wind behind her to force Enera off the side of the building it will be worth the biting cold on her exposed skin, the numb pain in her knees as they buckle against the force of the winds around her. 

*Hold on Enera... I'll get you off there...*

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

Morras watches his spell craft dig into the bard, a grim expression his face as he watches the man suffer. Still, the Cardinal had seen far worse and wouldn't be shaken by a pained face. Waiting for the man to fall unconscious, Morras stands tall until the sound of shattering glass rings at his feet.

Shards of glass ring as they shatter, cause Morras to jump back into the hallway on reflex. Arrows crash against the wall behind where he just stood, making him momentarily thankful for the strange form of attack. Morras spins on a heel, only to see a small blonde girl dive past him and run straight for Enera. His spell's concentration broken, nothing stood between her and his charge and that wouldn't do at all.

Pillars of light rise in Nokri's way, making her path sporatic and dangerous. Morras smirks, doubting the frail looking Drecian could navigate the course he'd made for her. Confident in his obstruction, he addresses the other people outside the room.

"Lady Tyndall. Assaulting a Cardinal will not earn you any favors in the Eraian government." He warns, his eyes narrow and dangerous. "And Elfriede, I do believe I gave you an order. Your insubordination aside; Torin has nothing to do with this scenario and I don't have the slightest clue as to why you'd bring him up. If you have grievances to air with my head bishop there is *surely* a more appropriate time, don't you think?" Morras chides, his tone becoming clipped as speaks. 

"I insist the two of you fall in line; this is a combat situation. Whatever may be troubling you can wait, you are *adults* are you not?" he says, his gaze questioning every part of your resolve.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

Somehow dodging most of the collapsing ceiling and searing light beams of death, Nokri scurried to Enera's side. "I don't think you should stay here," she muttered simply. She wrapped her arm around the girl's waist, simultaneously dragging Enera's weight and nudging her with her shoulder as they struggled to what used to be the wall. *Desi better be ready to catch us or I swear to whoever the [censored] it is this church worships."

It would have been wise just to throw the girl off the wall, but Nokri did not plan that far ahead and instead just tipped the both of them over the side. "Cover your head," she suggested as though they were taking a walk through the park and not diving off the edge of a church.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Anger and desperation are a short term fuel for vigor, and after being hit by Morris's most recent spell, the adrenaline was fading, along with Elirans own abilities. 
"Fall in line" was all he heard the Cardinal say to Afina... Afina, god she looked a mess, but it seemed that she was still in the cardinals good Grace's. 
He turned to look for Enera, and saw Nokri yeet over the edge with the girl _good..._ he thought to himself, _now we just need to run_ he gave a slight groan as he stood up, _I hope aldus is nearby and can catch me too_ looking at the cardinal, who was still staring at Afina. Mustering his strength, Eliran drew an arrow and let it fly towards the man. "ALDUS" he called out, falling backwards over the edge, the bow string still vibrating from the arrow he let fly.
 He hoped they'd be able to escape fast enough that Afina could avoid any major conflict with the cardinal, saving callora from any diplomatic issue. _i also hope nobody figures out who I am..._ Eliran realized as an afterthought, _Mom would be pissed if the company's rep went to crap because an Heir was playing hero._

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Afina’s hot-headed nature broke through her calmer, more diplomatic persona as she watched Eliran tumble off the ledge, weakened from the Cardinal’s attack. _This is ridiculous treatment for a guest_, Afina thought, eyes ablaze with anger. _If I divulge to him now that the Bishop committed such heinous crimes, then Elfriede’s true nature is revealed,_ she thought, glancing over at the knight. He was poised to attack, clearly irritated by the Cardinal’s commands, his hand tense on the hilt of his sword. Afina’s gaze softened; She felt immensely betrayed by Elfriede’s actions, and was therefore very angry with the knight. But seeing him stand there, tense and obviously worried, still hurt her heart immensely. She could not jeopardize his welfare just to save her kingdom’s reputation. 

_Or you could kill the Cardnal_. The thought was morbid, and Afina was almost ashamed for having thought it. But if she killed the Cardinal, then Eraia would not know who to blame for the Bishop’s and Cardinal’s murder. And even if it were to be pinned on Afina, it would be speculation at best; With the state of international relations now, Eraia couldn't afford to make an enemy out of Callora anyways. Dreca was moving in to make an ally out of Wynne, who had already been Callora’s ally for years. Eraia had to tread carefully to avoid making any more enemies…

_Tyndalls pursue diplomacy up until the moment that it fails_.

The thought chided Afina. She grimaced. There was no distinct reason to kill the Cardinal here, on the assumption that she and Elfriede could even accomplish such a feat. Without the ability to kill or speak honestly with the Cardinal, the Laeran princess was left with only one option: to lie. “Actually, Cardinal, not to display the obvious but it seems that the structural integrity of your security here at the monastery has been-.” Afina stopped as her stomach lurched again, the nausea from the drugs making the acid rise in her throat. She turned to the side and promptly leaned over, yellow-green bile splattering across the floor. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. “Compromised,” Afina finished, clearing her throat. 

“One of these _ruffians_ seem to have been able to poison my food whilst I was in your care. I believe it to be your best interest to increase security.” Afina turned to leave out the door, tomes still wedged between her chest and the forearm of her injured hand. “Come, Elfriede, the safety of the monastery is not up to standard, let us pack my things and pursue the thieves. For the good of Laera as well as Eraia.”

Desii's head quirks at the irony of Nokri tackling Enera off the side of the building just as Desii was about to blow the girl off the side of the building. Her mind whirs, trying to find a way to let this spell still be useful in the fight. She can't redirect it to force Morras back, and as Enera and Nokri are currently safe in Aldus's arms she doesn't need to propel either of the short girls further away. 

Just before Desii surrenders to wasting the pages of her Tome, Eliran dives backwards off the building, a demented trust fall as he calls Aldus's name. Desii releases the spell faster than she thought possible, letting a gale force wind blow from the center of Enera's once room and out the blown out wall. The wind hit Eliran dead on, propelling him far past Aldus and closer to where Desii herself stood. 

Desii drops her Tome, opening her arms wide to make to catch Eliran, copying Aldus's motions moments before. Seeing the man come at her she panics, arms wrapping around herself protectively. Desii and Eliran collapse into a ball of limbs and the young woman shrieks as they roll another 5 feet. Desii groans, her already dirtied clothes from her own exodus of the monastery taking more damage.

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

Enera watches the man who went toe to toe with the Cardinal for what felt like an eternity fly over her head. Her breath catches in her throat as she whips around to see... him barrel into the girl who knew her mother. Judging by the groans of pain, Enera marked the two off as okay for now.

Enera squirmed lightly, going over Aldus's shoulder in a sort of front flip to come up on her feet. The Tome she's held since the conflict started flitters open, power already emanating from it. Enera begins reciting a spell on auto pilot, watching the rim of the ledge for Morras to stalk forward.

She finishes the spell, letting a star burst of light appear over the ledge. The baseball sized light begins to compress in on itself and Enera calls out.

"Don't look!" She yells as loud as her voice can muster. The star burst expands as Enera tucks her head into her shoulder with her eyes clenched shut. The light radiating from the point is like looking into the sun. Much like it's celestial counter part, anyone looking into it would easily be blinded for precious moments.

Morras watches the room empty with and grimaces. This became far more difficult with everyone outside. Behind him both Afina and Elfriede made make comments aimed in his direction, yet the Cardinal tunes him out. The Princess is being selfish, as they are want to be, and the Knight is smitten and following her lead. They've bared no fangs, so to speak, so they're of no consequence. 

Morras steps forward, forming two pillars of light to his left and right, nearly touching the corners of the ledge overlooking the courtyard. The pillars spin, splitting into individual rings which prime themselves to fly into the courtyard. He can see Enera opening her own tome, behind the wolf man.

"What a failing as a teacher, for my own apprentice to raise their hand against me." He says over the lip. "But there is a reason I teach you, Enera. I have a far more experienced mastery of the magic of our Goddess; do you really think you can best me? With time, you may. If you are Her Avatar then may you can manifest such strength even now. But given how easily you are swayed by this earthly feelings, I truly doubt you have any relation to the Lady of Light." 

Morras frowns. Two more pillars rise behind him, splitting in the same way. At least two dozen rings are at the ready behind him, spinning as if mill saws. They all launch at once, filling the air with glowing disks. The only saving grace is that his spell seems to have a mind of it's own as it fills the courtyard, rather than half a dozen disks heading for each of you the disks fly off in random directions, only one or two coming even close to you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

With the Cardinal distracted, and the fate of Callora no longer seemingly at stake, Afina took her chance and absconded into the hallway. Elfriede followed close behind, with a similar alertness that he always carried, though his face betrayed his dejected state. From behind her, the princess could hear the faint "don't look!" echo down the hallway. _A light mage indeed_, she thought. Afina walked quickly and purposefully, anxious to follow Eliran out of the monastery, and get away from these power-hungry officials.

Her escort wavered in the doorway as Afina packed her things, shoving books and provisions into her bag. Elfriede left for a brief moment, likely to pack his own things, and Afina quickly took advantage of the moment in solitude and changed to her traveling clothes. The Eraian knight reappeared in the doorway as Afina held her sword in her hands. _So associated with Elfriede... I almost want to leave it here. But to do so would be more than disrespectful, especially after his family welcomed me into their home_, she thought, eventually strapping it to her waist.

"Let's leave," Afina beckoned, brushing past Elfriede and stalking down the hallway towards the stairs, and eventually, the door. _I have to say something. Now may not be the most optimal time, but we need to talk about what happened earlier_, she thought, glancing sidelong at the knight. _He killed someone today._ Pain throbbed through her left hand as she tried to hold her tomes tightly to her chest, in the case that she should need them. _Out of necessity for protecting his charge and... romantic interest_, Afina reminded herself. 

Two schools of thought fought against each other in Afina's mind. Part of her wanted to lash out at Elfriede, angry at his actions of that night. The other part of Afina still cherished Elfriede's presence, and wanted nothing more than to be close to him. The princess could feel the heat rise to her cheeks as she thought about their proximity together the other night. Afina stopped short of the doorway as a sudden thought came to her.

_Maybe you're just upset that the person you had romantic interest turned out to be a laguz_. 

A shiver ran up Afina's back as she became intensely aware of the scar that ran up her right side. _Am I judging Elfriede for his race rather than the fact that he killed a man? If he had been human and killed the Bishop..._

Afina looked up as she noticed Elfriede watching her with a puzzled expression. She straightened her back. "Sorry. Nauseous," she explained curtly, hoping to give no room for Elfriede to respond. _I'll have to ruminate on that thought later..._

The princess exited the monastery to catch sight of Eliran weakly exiting the combat zone, while his other companions seemed to still be holding back the Cardinal. Little flashes of light seemed to make as much evident. She rushed to the Eblian's side, unfastening her cloak and throwing it over his head. It wasn't much of a disguise, but it was the best she could offer. "Elfriede, provide cover, the Cardinal could have reinforcements close behind." 

She then turned to Eliran. "I take it that the Enera mission is not going particularly well," she said, a light smirk playing across her face, glad to have her close friend at her side once more. "Do you need help?" she asked, tone more serious. "Your companions really shouldn't be trying to take on the strongest light mage in Eraia. They-- No, WE-- need to escape."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-23*

While Desii's save left much to be desired (Eliran is personally a fan of being caught by a nice strong man over a dainty girl), it was extremely appreciated. Groaning beside the brunette girl he started to get up. "thanks Desii..." He looked to the girl, "Are you ok?" He looked back towards the fight , the after effects of Enera's magic, "We need to move" He said simply, helping Desii up, Eliran started to limp out and away from the church. The sooner they could blend back in with the crowd the better, and if he could find somewhere to change and recover that would be best.

After gaining a bit of distance, Eliran spotted a familiar face as a cloak suddenly went around him.  "Understatement of the year princess"  Eliran retorted in his usual fashion, albeit with a slight difficulty due to his state. "Next time... your knight boy can handle the close quarters combat...." He gestured his head towards Elfriede. 
 Looking back at his friends, Eliran gave back the cloak to Afina, "I'm... fine" He said, clearly anything but, "put this... on Enera... she's too famous... must hide..." He coughed again _fuck this is pitiful_. He looked at Afina again _she's okay... he thought, her smirk and concern clear on her face. _Idiot I'm the one who's worried_ He thought to himself, "You should go... Don't want to get callora involved..."

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

After your rendezvous outside the monastery you're given only a moment to catch your breath before the sound of of boots comes clomping from down the street. Soldiers mixed with clergy members come running around the bend, looking about for a moment before spotting your group. The town guardsmen, probably alerted by the sounds and lights of the battle, have joined the clergymen in hunting you down. 

Due to the size of Trisp, the streets behind you quickly fill with the guardsman and clergy. There are too few side streets and avenues and it's not long before the entire party is on your tail. On the other side of the coin, the size of the party is smaller than you'd expect for the same reason, the clergymen out numbering the soldiers by at least a few. Your only escape route seems to be the southern exit from town. 

Enera, the target of the man hunt, stays close to Desii and the older woman keeps a tight grip on her hand. She looks resolutely forward however, compared to Desii's constant looking behind her with worry. At one point the girl even leads the escaping group, knowing a shortcut she once took when allowed out of the monastery. It even puts some distance between you and the search party, though you can sense their approach.

- - - - -

Exhaustion forces everyone to slow as they reach the top of the southern hill. Far to the east you can see the start of the forest, and to the west is the coast. South the hills continue, the rough terrain obscuring the horizon. The darkness makes everything distant seem shadowed and ominous, though the light of the stars and moon prevent you from tripping over each other. 

Behind you in the distance you can see torch lights moving out of Trisp. It appears the Cardinal is not willing to let you make such a clean escape. You think you hear horse hooves on the wind, which is a prospect that settles in the pit of your stomach. Horses would make this escape twice as difficult, given their greater speed. 

Enera, standing next to Desii (whose collapsed onto her knees and is panting heavily) looks around the group. "They're... still coming. If the Cardinal's usual gusto applies to his, um..." Enera pouts slightly, not liking her own word choice, "theories about me; he'll have men follow us all the way to Dreca." Enera says. Her shoulders clench up a bit, and her arms wrap around her torso for a moment, making her look smaller than she is. "I appreciate your help..." she says humbly, having not had the chance before. "But what are we to do?" she asks, looking up to the many faces present.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-29*

The occasional tear cut a clean path in Afina's dirty face as they fled Trisp. With adrenaline wearing off, her left hand throbbed with pain, though thankfully the nausea seemed to have disappeared. Another tear fell from the princess' eyes as they continued to walk. _I just want to go home,_ she thought, feeling exhausted and homesick. Eliran had been her only comfort during their hurried escape, but even he could only maintain conversation in short bursts, as his own fatigue left him winded. 

The light of the moon and stars was the only thing that illuminated their path as they finally stopped to rest on a hilltop. Scattered trees obscure them from view of the city, but not nearly enough to throw the pursuing forces off their trail. Afina wiped her face clean with her forearm, lowering her hood to address the group. She still looked quite pale, and plenty worse for wear. It was as if the confident, bright eyed Afina had been left somewhere in Trisp, and a hazy, incomplete copy of herself had followed the escaping party departing the city.

"We go to Callora, of course. We promised to return Enera, and the Callorian kingdoms will provide political asylum for you. Dreca nor Theanovene provide such advantages. And Wynne is far too distant. We follow the route Elfriede and I took to get here, surely that is the smartest decision." 

"Sadly, our pursuers don't seem to be deterred by night fall. We don't have many options besides continuing our exodus. Other than, maybe fighting them. But I doubt such an engagement would end well, given our current status." 

Afina sat down on a nearby log, dusting it off with her free hand before sitting down. She began to fidget with her hand cast; The princess had very little idea how such a binding worked. _Interesting, how I was never taught such skills,_ she thought, unwrapping and rewrapping the cloth.  

"I anticipate that this stop is short-term; we must keep walking to get to Callora."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-30*

Throughout the travels to escape the Eraians. Eliran was passed mainly between Aldus and Afina for when he needed support. As they finally sat to rest, he sat almost motionless with his hands over his knees, trying to recuperate as much as possible. Listening to the conversation around him, he pointed to the forest ahead of them, "First we need to escape... we must go through the forest." He tried to stand up, only to stumble a bit before Afina helped him up. "The Eraian's horses won't be able to follow us, it'll make  escaping easier." He coughed and stood up properly alone before looking to Afina, "Callora should be our end goal. be we can't go by land. They'll expect it. After we lose them in the forest we should head to the sea. Find a smuggler and escape."

"Callora..." Desii says, looking between the Princess and her musically inclined companion. "Can we make it there? The northern border is on the other side of Trisp, we'll surely be caught... and south requires us crossing the entirety of Eraia. Surely the Cardinal will send messengers ahead?" Desii continues, her tone sinking the more she dwells on it. 

She feels a soft squeeze of her hand, Enera still holding onto the young mage's hand. Eliran suggests travel by sea, and Desii smiles at the blonde beside her. The chaos was worth the discomfort. 

"There's no port west of Trisp... There's nothing till we get down by Lyall really." Desii says, trying to remember the maps she'd seen in Zaimar's study. "We'd have to be lucky enough to stumble onto a sailing by ship, then be able to get there attention..." Desii continues as she stands up. She doesn't let go of Enera's hand, instead returning the girl's squeeze. "I suppose with the light magic users we have here, we could easily make a flare though!" she says, some chip returning to her voice. She then looks to Aldus with a smile.

"We'd also be able to find some of the Crysalin for you Aldus." she says, thinking about how far flung her friend was from his original goal. It was... honorable, the way he stepped up to help with Desii and even with the Princess. It made her smile warmer thinking that if Aldus was around when Zaimar was making his schemes... He'd have helped her, no questions asked.

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

The distance sound of hooves fades in and out as the horses slow to navigate the difficult terrain. Far down the hill you think you can see the dancing lights of the search party. They have unfortunately not erred from the path you just travelled. It appears they're still able to track you.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-08-31*

Elfriede ran. His military stamina pumping his legs onward; his left hand keeping his rapier still on his belt. 

*You, are a traitor Faun.* 

He heard his old commander say… and he couldn’t rightly deny it. They only thing keeping him from breaking down was the adrenaline pumping through his veins as they ran. 
Elfriede occasionally slowed down to allow everyone to rest, but he kept rather quiet that night. Not saying so much as a single word to anybody for quite a time. His mind... lost in his shattered world. For a moment he returned to reality. *Sounds of hooves in the distance.* They clearly had put some space between them and their pursuers somehow. There had been a conversation prior, but Elfriede was too far gone to recognize it at all. 

*You’re a liar Faun.*

He felt his heart strings tug as he thought of Lyall… will he ever be allowed back? ...Maybe they wont tie him to it… *Maybe I should return right now and give away this group. Or split off, they'll never know I was a part of it.* He turned an eye to Afina who was approaching Nokri for ideal chatter. *She’d give me away in an instant if I left.* 

Whether founded on reason or not the thought held. Elfriede’s mind wandered again to his relationship with the girl he’s been traveling with for a month. 
Elfriede finally caught a piece of a conversation spoken louder than the rest. “...the choice in suitors out here, absolutely dreadful!”

Elfriede lightly scoffed. He boiled inside. Both with anger, and remorse. He felt as though he deserved it, but her words cut deep. Alas, Elfriede shook his head and kept it down, as he always had done. Their end goal? Callora? Elfriede found it hard to swallow such a destination, all he wanted was to return home, or find his sister. The spiteful princess was suddenly a bit lower on his priorities.

“The hooves have gotten louder.” Elfriede’s recently unheard voice cut through the silence. He slowed his pace to walk alongside Aldus whom shouldered the burden of Eliran right now. “Please allow me to carry you for a short time, ‘til we can be rid of our dogged pursuers.” He remarked to Canterat, his wolf-like eyes making eye contact.

*I need to get a message to my parents. Will they even want to see me again?*

Offering a hand to Eliran with a straight face that hid his pain, Faun decided to continue with this group until they reached the shore. He would decide then, for he couldn’t put his faith in anyone right now. ...Except Yuria. His heart panged as he realized that the only other person in his life he was beginning to rely on was so very far away now. It was as if Princess Tyndall was on the other side of deep fog.

*In the end, you are just a lowly Laguz… Sir Faun* His mind heard **her** say. 
And Faun agreed.

**Bill** - *2018-09-10*

As the group deliberates what to do, there's a slight shaking to the ground behind Desii. Just as the keener eyes in the group notice the grass shuffling unnaturally, there's a popping sound and section of ground rises from the top of the khill. It's a two plank wide segment, a layer of grass and dirt some attached to the top of it that blends into the hill. On the underside of the planks are handles, held by muscled hands. 

"You caused a right ruckus didn't you? Who the hell are you people?" A voice calls from below. The cover is placed to the side and the hands climb up over the side. A well built man comes attached the hands, short brown hair kept manageablely short and trimmed, green eyes, and a face weathered from experience, not age. His rabbit ears are tall and prominent on him, you can see as he climbs up he has the tail of a rabbit as well. His steely expression is nothing like the small tail however.

Behind him three more Kouneli rise from the hole, a woman who watches the incoming forces with a spy glass, and a pair of burly men who seems to back the speaker. Another pair of ears is visible out of the top of the hole. Each has vestiges of leather armor on, a greave here of a chest plate there, but all are primarily dressed for speed. None of the Kouneli have weapons you can see.

The speaker looks over the group of you. "An Eraian knight, running from his own forces? What kind of story do we have here? A child, a girl who looks like she's never left home before, a Naissankari warrior and..." The man's nose twitches, akin to his animal side. His gaze suddenly narrows on Elfriede.

The man transforms in naught a second, his form shifting into a rabbit laguz. The deer sized creature has gangly limbs and powerful back legs, with a long torso. It's ears flop wildly and despite the transformation the man's leather gauntlet has stayed in place. He sniffles again, before transform right back.

"And an injured man." says the man as soon as he has a human mouth again, apparently no longer bothered by whatever distracted him. "You aren't going to get far with him. Not further than the Trisp forces at any rate. We can get you out, but you're with us till you pay us back the favor, to be determined when we get where we're going. It's the only deal you're going to-" 

"2 minutes till they have visual Andres." the woman says suddenly.

"get." Andres finishes. "And if you can't tell... you're on the clock."

Desii rolled forward when the Kouneli had appeared. She lost her grip on Enera's hand, and quickly came up behind the girl on her knees, hands resting on Enera's shoulders. She had never seen Kouneli before, and certainly not transformed. 

She looks back at the group. "Isn't this... a break? It's like we've found..." she pauses, eyes flicking skyward as she thinks, "eight rabbit's feet. That's a lot of luck." she says. The favor thing... is scary, obviously, but they were good enough to help them out right? Only good people would help them like this. They must need help with helping other people.

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Andres beings to tap his foot on the ground, and his eyes spare more than a few glances to his spyglass holding partner. He looks over the downtroddened and worn out group, from Eliran clutching his wound to Afina's fight damaged clothes to the scared but defiant young Enera. His nose twitches a few times in the process, clearly some kind of tell for his thoughts.

"1 minute." the woman says. Andres replies with a sigh into his hand.

"You know what. I'm not going to ask. Get in the burrow. You lot look hopeless now, but I don't doubt you have something that you can pay us back with. "Frock, Alrow. Motivate them a little." He says through his palm, and the two Kouneli give quick affirmations as they spread out around the group. They transform mid stride, and nudge not so passively your entire group into the hole. One of them transforms back beside Eliran, and goes to place the injured man on his compatriot's back. The two then resume their *subtle* suggestion to get into the burrow. By the time the woman has started a 15 second count down, you're all inside.

The hole is deceivingly large. Inside a squirrely looking Kouneli stands, motioning the group towards one of two tunnels leading out of the dugout. Behind you Andres and the woman hop down, Andres transforming and using his larger form to pull the cover over the top of the hideout. Andres transforms back, his hand hushing the group, both his people and yourselves. 

Just as the insanity of standing still and quiet begins to tickle at the back of your mind, you begin to hear pounding overhead. In a flash you can hear the hooves of the pursuit party's horses galloping across the trapdoor, causing dirt to dust down over your heads. A plank cracks in the trap door base which causes the squirrely Kouneli to make to panic, only to be silenced by the woman's hand.

As quickly as they arrived, the horses gallop on past the tunnel. You can feel the ground around you vibrate less as the beasts carry your pursuers further away. Andres finally removes his finger from his lips.

"Well. It holds for another escape." he says, glancing at the trapdoor. 

"We can't use this again like that Andres..." the squirrely Kouneli sighs. "I'll make note to send a team out for some repairs. It's too good a spot to lose it." Andres nods back to him as a response, then makes eye contact with his guests.

"Well, go on. Get." he says dryly. His team transform, and three take up the rear behind you as two lead the way into the tunnel. It's a quiet trip, given the Kouneli don't transform back at all. All there is is the endless tunnel, lit only by the torches your group needs to carry. Finally light starts to creep in from the end of the tunnel, after what feels like endless walking. 

You emerge into a cove, tucked away under a cliff. Anchored just outside is a ship, one that looks quite familiar to Elfriede and Afina. It bears no flag of alliance, and seems a bit worse for the wear. It is crewed entirely by Kouneli laguz, who scurry about the ship in both transformed and untransformed states. It is indeed, the ship that challenged the Aster. 

Rowboats are tied off by the water and you are shepherded to them. All but the Kouneli carrying Eliran transform back to their humanoid forms. 

"Hop on. And don't make the joke, it won't make you any friends here." Andres says, walking past you to get on the rowboat himself. "Frock will wait for a second rowboat, so he can continue carrying your friend. If one of you wants to wait with him and Alrow help yourself, but don't try anything. Please, we have a deadline here."

- - - - -

You find yourselves all on the deck of the ship, and quite popular. Andres yells at a younger boy to get the Captain and he scampers off in his laguz form. All sorts of questions are fired from the crowd around you, though no one approaches your group by more than 10 feet. The jeering however, comes from all sides. 

*"Where's your ruddy goddess now, ey?"

"So much for military might, ha!"

"The ladies are pretty though!"

"Who brings a kid to a ship, it's bad luck I say."

"Captain is going to have you quartered for this."

"Is that a knight miboy, that's amazing!"

"One's a Naissankari you idiot."

"Doesn't matter, if they're Eraian."*

"Just bring the Captain ey?" Andres groans at the crowd, and he begins to argue with them over various comments. On the far side of the crowd Aldus and Nokri spot a very strange face. Tikur, the Naissankari from the square all those weeks ago, is thoroughly consumed in scrubbing off gunk from the deck.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-09-20*

When the ground began shaking, Nokri was caught unawares and jumped higher than a professional athlete. Members of their party would likely recall her shocked reaction and shrill "*yeek*" in the future whenever they needed a chuckle. The panic faded quickly and Nokri regained her stoic composure, glaring none too fondly at whatever it was that caused the stir. 
*Ah. Of course. Typical lagul,* she thought as she spied the newcomers and their long ears. *No common decency.*

Nokri did not particularly enjoy being corralled underground. She had become somewhat particular around tunnels and caves since she was nearly murdered in one and decided to stick close to Aldus, figuring that if one of these rabbits tried something he could bite them or whatever.

On the ship deck, she put on a sweet face for the onlookers. Shouts were coming from every which way that it was hard to distinguish any one thing being said, so she observed their surroundings. "Are we being kidnapped again?" she mused. More jeering followed. "I think they like us." Nokri recalled Desii's comment about rabbit feet and her mind filled with thoughts of finances. How much would these guys' feet sell for if one of the crew just so happened to accidentally lose one? Would just an ear suffice, or did it have to be a foot? Maybe a nice ear could be sold for its fur, and as Nokri scanned the crowd for the laguz with hypothetically the best fur, one in particular caught her eye. He looked familiar. But why?

"Have we met that guy?" she whispered, pointing her chin at the furball in question. It was hard to know for sure, but a muggy memory was slowly being dredged up from the back of her memory.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-09-20*

The first one to speak is Afina, in hushed tones to Eliran she explains Elfriede’s heritage. *He’s a Naissankari?! I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised after all the strange smells on the both of them but… why would he hide it? He has no ears, were they cut off, did he cut them off himself? Has he a tail? Has he any respect for his heritage, or would his country sweep our people under the rug just as it does it’s dirty deeds?* Aldus glares at Elfriede, before easing his gaze upon taking in Elfriede’s dejected stare into the soil. *It would seem the princess has some reservations about our people as well… funny, she hid her racism around me quite well.” He pushes thoughts of the other off until later though, if there is one.

--

By the time they stop to take a breather on the hill, Aldus had resigned himself to the idea of being arrested. *This is it, im going to rot to death in an Erian prison and be marked a kidnapper, good job, great name you’ve made for yourself out there* He sarcastically lectures himself inwardly just as a voce breaks the awkward silence among their ragtag crew.  

He’s never seen a  Kouneli before . He makes a conscious effort not to gawk, as he’s quite used to being on the other end of judging states at this point. 

---

In what seems like only moments their situation has turned around quite well in Aldus’ opinion. These Kouneli have quite the operation down here, very convenient. 

Upon the boat Aldus finds himself once again on the wrong end of those judging stares he tried so hard not the give as many Kouneli gather around to gaw at their group. *Guess I can’t blame them though, we must look interesting” 

At Nokri’s comment he follows her gaze to a man scrubbing away at the ships surface. “Yes, I believe we have?” he responds, noting how close she’s come to him since their entrance into the rabbit hole. “Wasn’t he in Theanovene? At your stall? Ancestors help me though, I can’t remember his name to save my soul. We only spoke briefly”

**Bill** - *2018-09-20*

"No need." You hear in a commanding voice from over the crowd. The various sailors either shut up or give small cheers at the sound of the voice, and the back chatter stops. A hole begins to part in the circle around you.

Andres shifts his weight onto his back leg, awkwardly scratching the back of his head. "Well, here we go." he mutters. His woman friend gives a pat on the shoulder before merging into the ring of Kouneli around you, clearly content to watch. "You lot," Andres grumbles over his shoulder, "Don't make me look an ass here."

A man approaches your assembled group, the sailors letting him pass like thread through a needle. He has scruffy brown hair that covers his human ears and brushed his broad shoulders. While not a muscular build he’s solid and you can tell he’s an accomplished fighter simply by the way he moves. He has brown stubble on his surprisingly young face, He is in his upper 20’s lower 30’s. He has three daggers on his left side, and a scimitar on his right. He has scars up his right arm, old and deep. He wears a short sleeve white shirt with a leather vest over top, worn open. 

He approaches and stops, chewing on a weed like a farmer would in the field. He takes in Andres first, then Aldus and Nokri behind him. "Why did you bring souvenirs back from a recon mission Andres?" the man says evenly. "Drecian no less. That's bad news, you realize the more Eraians they kill the better for us right?" He adds dryly. All around the circle people snicker and chuckle at the wise crack. 

"Laugh it up you hyucks..." Andres says to the crowd, rolling his eyes in dismissal. "Captain, I'm following a hunch. This group? They're of value to Eraia." The Captain raises an eyebrow and begins walking in a circle around your group.

"I don't see how that's going to help us. We're heading home, not to ransom... I don't even know, a pair of nuns?" He says as he gets a look at Desii and Enera. "Nuns and a Drecian." He chides.

"Captain, is this really necessary?" Andres sighs, walking a step behind the man. "You know I'm just as serious about the cause as you, I'm not screwing around here." 

"You're a loyal man Andres, but this has *disrupted the entire ship* with it's nonsense and I feel a little embarrassment is a suitable punishment for..." the Captain stops, dead in his tracks when Afina and Elfriede come into view. His eyes, twinkling with amusement and sarcasm cloud and pierce their way through the injured knight and princess. 

"There's nothing to see here." The Captain says suddenly, louder and with all the mirth lost from his voice. The sailors move at once, back to posts or anywhere not near the Captain. Only Andres remains, who looks at his Captain curiously and cautiously.

"Haldel...?" Andres says. 

"Captain." Haldel replies on automatic. "Take them to the brig, but tend to them and give them what they need. For the love of *god* take their weapons and *spellbooks*, and see to it they're okay. I'll come get them when we're at sea." Haldel orders. Andres only nods in response, waving to a few onlookers to serve as the armed guard. Haldel turns on a heel, but pats Andres on the shoulder as he pass him. 

"Your gut hasn't failed you yet." He says to Andres, and the scout smirks. Haldel then leaves, heading below deck. 

- - - - -

Haldel's orders are followed to the letter. While your weapons and tomes are taken, they are simple placed on the other side of the room and done so carefully. The Kouneli seem to bear no ill will and treat your belongings with respect. While they bring you food (standard fare for a ration, but no meager portion for prisoners) and medicine, Eliran is taken to the ship's doctor directly. You're given the Doctor's word that he's doing every thing he can for the injured minstrel.

Meanwhile you are left to sit. You can feel the ship lifting anchor, and feel it lurk as it turns to the south. Andres sticks around, resting on the table and chairs nearby and playing solitaire with a deck of cards. Anything that wasn't deemed a weapon is in the cell with you. 

After a while, Andres looks up suddenly and calls out. "Wolfie! Here boy!" he shouts down the hall. He's spotted Tikur, coming down from the deck and waves at the Naissankari in question.
