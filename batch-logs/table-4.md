It's been a rough day for Tikur. So rough in fact, that the jail cell he currently resides in might actually be the nicest place he's been. Theanovene's militiamen and just and fair, already having interviewed the wolf laguz for his take on the action in the markets. After his interview he was left behind to wait deliberation by the council representative whose managing the mess that occured. 

The cell is fairly new but as to be expected, scarce in the way comfort. A cot sits on side and a bucket on the other. There is a window opposite the cell door, also set with bars. The cinderblock walls are cool to the touch.

I hope the deliberation goes well for my sake Tikur muses to himself as he slowly paces across the room taking in the warmth from the sun through the window.  As he looks out over the city he thinks on what happened at the market stall.  "Hopefully that shopkeeper got out safe, don't want to know what they would do to her if they caught her now that we resisted on her behalf." "I think Aldus will be fine, he seems to know how to take care of himself." Tikur chuckles, now I hope I'm gonna be allright...

Time passes slowly. You can't tell how long it's been when a guard finally comes back to escort you through the prison. You go a different way than you did before, heading up a spiral staircase behind a guard station and leading into the guard station proper. Rather than lead you to the exit he leads you to a conference room down one branch in the hallway.

Inside is a lone woman with short blonde hair, black stains on her face from a kiln, and a heavy leather smock on the chair beside her. Clearly an artisan despite her young age, she looks at you with bright green eyes. 

"Hello Mr. Ishkabible. My name is Ria Schytas, chair of the Glassblower's Guild and representative on the Theanovene Council." she smiles softly. "I'm also the one who made the deliberation to release you, which I'm sure you are relieved to hear." She then motions for you to sit down and sips her coffee. 

"I have a request of you, Mr. Ishkabible. I am in need of someone decidedly unrelated to Theanovene and it's politics" she rolls her eyes at the word, "to go speak to someone for me. You are capable of defending yourselves, as we saw this afternoon and you do seem to be the amiable sort, at least in your interrogation." She pauses and watches her coffee swirl. Then with a shrug she smiles at you.

"Or I just have a hunch and tend to follow my gut." she almost looks like she expects a laugh as she says it. Eventually she clears her throat and moves on. "One of the other guild chairs has been over in Eraia recently, and it's starting to attract attention from all sorts of directions. I won't trouble you with the current political status of Theanovene's council, and not just because it'll bore all your ears off."

"I'd like you to see what he's been up to over in Eraia as a third party observer. Someone with no political ties or reason to lie. It doesn't have to be detailed information either, just enough to say he's acting with in the duties of his title." she says. She then puts a finger to her chin. "This isn't some kind of "deal" to release you either. You're welcome to refuse. It really does boil down to I have a hunch you can help me." she laughs sheepishly.

"Do you... have any questions? Are you willing to help?" she asks tentatively.

When she said that he was going to be released Tikjur gave a small sigh of relief.  After listening to her offer he thought for a moment "she seems the trustworthy sort, and we'll she did free me so I'm in her debt so I should probably go.  It will also give me somethi by to do for a bit which is nice" After his pondering he replied with a smile "Why not, it's the least I can do to make up for this afternoon."  "I do have a few questions, who would I be checking up on and will I have some way to show that I am in an observer position so I don't just get laughed at and tossed out the door?"

Ria looks at you funny for a moment. "Mr. Ishkabible, this is not so... forward of a mission. I have no legal right to be tailing this man, so were you to say you are you'd find yourself in yet another cell." She sighs. "And yet I ask this of you... It is quite terrible of me, to judge you as a just man then to ask you to act just the opposite." She picks at a nail, and obvious nervous tick.

"I assure you this, I ask you only for the good of Theanovene. The man I ask you to tail is Taiver Uori. He is also on the council and that gives him a lot of sway in the way things work in Theanovene. If you are unaware, Theanovene is run in accordance to the original charter drafted by the original 6 trade guilds that formed the city. It is each council member's role to uphold this charter's intent and goals while adapting to the modern world." Frustration crosses her features.

"Taiver consistently, day after day, week after week, month after month looks for ways around the charter. In the past to support Callora, and now to take a stance with Eraia. Despite all odds he's been gaining political allies, though I cannot say if it's through fair play or not." she down right growls. 

"I won't have him stepping all over the charter that's brought Theanovene to where it is today. He will be traveling to Eraia tomorrow, and this is where I wish for you to tail him to. I don't know why he's going but given his poltical acts I know there's a reason. You may find nothing, or you may find a smoking gun I can use to finally stop him from fouling the council room with his stench. I know it's a lot to ask of someone who didn't grow up here, quite frankly a complete stranger. But if you could help me..." she says, looking up at you with wide eyes. "I wouldn't forget it."

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-12-14*

Answering quickly Tikur agreed "I'll do it.  Usually when someone amassed that kind of power quickly it ends up being done shadily in a back room."  The last part said with a whisper of contempt.  "You have been nothing but just and courteous to me and I might not bring to much attention to...Taiver was it? As I tail him.  Is there any good way you might have noticed of mabey getting in good with him so that my espianoge could go smoother?" He said with a chuckle

Ria's eyes sparkle at your acceptance. "Thank you Mr. Ishkabible! I'll have everything drawn up by the morning." she says, a sigh leaving her. "I am not close with him and his, but I do know he frequently goes fox hunting. I do not know if he does when in Eraia though. So long as you can make yourself appear as someone of influence I'm sure he will speak to you, no matter where you are. He can smell the opportunity to brown nose a mile away." she adds. 

"If that's all your questions..." she says as she gets out of her chair. She walks around the table and grabs your hand in both of hers. "Thank you again." she says, before straightening out. "Come to the glassblower's guild tomorrow morning and I'll have prepared everything you'll need." she finishes with a nod. She then leaves the room, immediately starting a conversation with one of the men who had been waiting outside. You're left alone in the room and are quite free to go.
