**Round 1**

Tyndall Tower is tucked away behind one of the many libraries on Scribe Street. Despite it's 4 floors leaving it taller than the library ahead of it, it doesn't garner too much attention as some noble buildings in Theanovene tend to do. Rather uninspired to look at from the outside, it's courtyard entrance is accessed via a side alley of things. It's large wood doors are rather uninspired as well.

What the outside lacks the inside relishes in. Rugs cover the hardwood floors and plush furniture decorates each floor. More walls are bookshelves than brick, stuffed to the brim with books and scrolls covering any topic you can imagine. The tower lacks in lavish gold and decorations, instead adorned with practical luxuries such as globes and tapestries. It's here one Afina Tyndall resides, Callorian Princess of the kingdom of Laera. While the princess had been expecting a particular letter any day now, little did she know she'd have much more in the way of visitors today. Some looking for her position, and another with a long awaited letter. 

(OOC: OOC stands for *Out of Character*, we have channels for this buy I may throw them in as the GM. I've set a scene here to bring you all together, but going forward it's what your characters want to do, and how they interact with things and people.

Don't forget to describe your character for the rest of us, no harm in details! First posts are a nightmare, if you're stuck just describe how you're coming to see Afina.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-02*

The directions Elfriede Faun had gotten were not hard to follow, the tower stood out clearly. His left hand resting on the hilt of his slender sword he walked towards the tower with perfect posture. Though he isn't very tall and has a very young face he has an air of maturity about him. Groomed but shaggy brown hair and duelist plate armour with the insignia of Eraia on the chest. 
Elfriede wasn't exactly sure what the importance of this letter was he was to deliver to Afina but orders are orders; and he has never defied orders.
He passed all the rabble in the street, which included a beggar asking for a handout, without a second thought, even managed a  quiet scoff. 
The boy stood before the tower knocked swiftly twice and sighed. Just promoted to knight-leiutenant and now he's acting as a courier. What a joke.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-02*

Despite its unremarkable exterior, the inside of Tyndall Tower was in a flurry of bright liveliness. Afina Tyndall, the tower’s main occupant, bustled from corner to corner inside the tower, collecting books and scrolls from the shelves of the main library. She had recently made what she believed to be a breakthrough in her studies, and was hoping to confirm these new findings. 

She splayed the books across her desk in the center of the room, placing her hands on her hips and surveying her collection. She smiled to herself, proud of the books she had gathered before her. It was rare, if not unheard of, for new spells associated with light magic to be developed. Clearly whoever created that story hadn’t taken the Laeran people into account, she thought.

About to dive into her books, Afina’s eyes hesitated on the royal blue banner that hung above the library’s fireplace. On it, an owl with wings outstretched flew, clasping an olive branch in its talons. She pursed her lips, the banner of her kingdom reminding her of home. She missed Laera. Her hometown, her family, her people. Everything. 

Afina shook off the thought, tucking her bright blonde hair behind her ear and opening up a scroll. She spread the scroll, using books to hold the rolled piece of parchment in place, and began to trace the symbols with her finger, murmuring her incantations quietly. The library began to fill with a soft light that perforated every corner of the room, escaping into the hallway through a crack in the door. So far so good, Afina thought.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-03*

“Ah, so this is where the Callorian princess is residing,” she scoffed with a sharp tongue. The bland tower with its stone and mortar was underwhelming, moreso with the moss growing between the cracks and grids of grey rock. Alas, this must be her first step in her path of knowledge and arcana.

Her preparations out-did herself, having a dress of spring flowers tethered to a earthly cloth, and an emerald, satin ribbon tied around her hair to finish the ensemble. While the original garment was of a *’borrowed’* hand-maiden’s uniform, she worked around the working class style by tossing the apron and bonnet, and covering the seams with bouquets of flowers, each stem having to be stabbed into the fabric. The ribbon was tied together forming a small green bow on the right-side of her brown hair, partially covering one of her tabby-patterned ears. Her cheeks and lips had a light-red hue, giving her a more focused complexion when up close. While her ears and tail still stuck out, something she chose to leave as a matter of principle, it seemed to do nothing except bring more attention to the dress, as if they are accessories needed for completion.

She recalled her previous pacing and pondering, attempting to plan out each situation that could follow and how she should approach them. She thought it best to use the front door, people tend to befriend visitors more than sleuths. Still, sneaking in would be an effective Plan B. As for the servant that would answer, for she was certain the princess or another noble wouldn’t come to answer, she still pondered if they would let her in. In past experiences, she found servants to be bland or over-protective of their masters, giving no curiosity to the questions in front of them unless they were truly entertaining. Her outfit might make her pass as not lower class, but nothing is certain.

She also wrote a small introductory letter in case she couldn’t get through, trying to be as polite to noble society as possible. She sighed, wondering if she just overthought this whole endeavor. She should just step up to the door and- her attention was quickly drawn away to the boy at the front entrance.

*”What’s this?”* she pondered, seeing his blade and stance. *”He seems rather young; perhaps he’s a squire or new recruit?”* Her mind raced with different options, problems, and solutions. A quick smirk was given before calming herself with a gentle composure. She glided over to the young man, letter pressed between her two thumbs and index fingers, but kept pristine to keep from crimping.

Her plan was set and she would take any advantage given to her.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-03*

Near the far end of Scribe Street, a wolf is seen striding towards the Tyndall Tower. The wolf’s snow white colored fur glistens in the sun, while it’s deep grey eyes do not wander. With every step taken a howl can be heard echoing through the streets mesmerizing all who listen. 

As the wolf approaches the Tyndall Tower, the howling seems to stop and the wolf seamlessly transforms into a muscular Laguz female. 
“I’ve finally arrived! The time has come to finish my challenge,” Atalantia thinks to herself as she braces towards the large wooden doors of the tower. It is at that moment, that she pushes aside two travelers, lanky in comparison, who stand directly in front of the doors.

Despite being unfamiliar with this location, Atalantia was not phased by the new environment. She had come for one purpose; Atalantia had to find the daughter of the royal family in Laera so that she may form a symbol of alliance with her. Only after forming an alliance would she be recognized as a formidable opponent by the Wynne men.

**Bill** - *2017-10-04*

**Round 2**

It's barely a moment after Atalania arrives at the oak doors that they open to a well dressed man. While certainly not peasant tier, his clothes don't give off the impression of a noble, particularly because of the muted colors. His hair is blond, with a high hair line despite the tips of his ears being covered by his hair. He has a groomed mustache over a pair of pursed lips.

He looks over Atalania first, taking in her bold expression. His nose twitches. He glances to the other girl, dressed as finely as one can without a tailor's services. His lip twitches in time with her ears. He finally turns to the last person at the door, the one in Eraian military garb. His eyebrow rises at the insignia on the soldier's plate.

Ending his scan he stands a little straight, subtly stepping into the door frame completely. "Good Afternoon ladies and gentleman. I am Itory, and I serve the lady of the tower. I'm afraid I must ask each of your purposes for calling; the lady is currently engaged. I'll bring your concerns to milady and return with news if she acquiesces to see you at this time." He says with practiced ease.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-04*

The boy matches the look from the man at the door. A butler?

"I am Knight-Leiutenant Elfriede Faun, and I am here with a letter from Eraia for the Lady though I know not its contents."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-04*

Atalantia stands in a confident manner hoping that this man, who stands before her, might be able to lead her to the daughter of the royal family of Laera.
“Hello Itory, I have traveled a long distance in search of the daughter of the royal family in Laera. Upon visiting the Callorian Kingdom, I have been informed that the princess awaits here, yet I do not know why. I have come in peace and my only wish is to form a symbol of alliance with the princess” Atalantia eagerly says in response to Itory’s question.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-05*

*Kailyin adjusted herself, patting herself off of dust from the sudden shove. She wasn't sure what to think of the wolf laguz, but decided that would be a question for another time. She then rose up only to lower herself to greet the servant in the Collerian fashion.*

"Hello to you Itory. You may refer to me as K, and I am a maiden seeking an audience with your lady."

*She rises back up to look at the butler eye to eye.*

"I do not need to rush, but it appears that the princess should answer our calls sooner rather than later, especially if its of a message of such great importance to be held by a ranked knight and an envoy of..." Kailyn stuttered for a second in slight bewilderment, "peace?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-05*

Afina hesitated when she heard the faint sound of knocking and the creak of the main tower doors opening. Losing concentration, the light she had just conjured popped and fizzled out, like a spark jumping out of a fireplace. "Dumb!" she hissed at it, slamming her book shut. It wasn't often she used the common curses of Laera, but a failed magic attempt certainly warranted one. She huffed. Better luck next time.                   

Afina cracked the door of the library open, squinting down the hall to peer at who might be at the door. Itory, naturally, stood in the doorway to block the visitor from view. Afina didn't get many visitors nowadays, occasionally messengers would come from home to deliver letters, sometimes beggars would come in their dirtiest clothes begging for scrap (often she would instruct Itory to give them a book and some bread and be gone). But rarely were visitors ever there to see /Afina/. More often than not, people often came seeking her father, King Achelous, and were disappointed to see the less-renowned princess. She frowned. Another inane visitor and she may just lose her head. "Itory, who's at the door?"

**Bill** - *2017-10-09*

**Round 3**

Itory looks over each of the guests before nodding all the collected guests. "Please wait here. I will inform Milady of your requests." he says after putting on a pleasant service smile. He steps back and closes the doors into the tower. 

A few minutes later the door's handle clinks as it's opened again. Itory opens the door fully and steps aside with the door. 

"Milady will meet you now." he says simply before leading them into the tower itself. The tower feels warm on the inside, lit by firelight in every corner. There's a staircase to the left of the entrance and a short passage forward before a door. Itory leads the group to the right instead, the corridor curving around the rim of the tower slightly before coming to another door. He opens the door and gestures the guests into the large library beyond the door. Across the room sits the lady of the tower, behind a large ornate desk covered in paper and books. 

"This is Afina Tyndall, Princess of Laera, of the Callorian Alliance." Itory says formally, announcing the title will practiced ease. Once each of the guests enter he closes the door behind them. Itory then takes his place on the right side of the room, closer to Afina than the visitors.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-09*

*Elfriede does a slight practiced bow of his head with one arm across his chest*

"Lady Tyndall, if I may, I am Knight-Lieutenant Elfriede. I've come to deliver a letter to you. I unfortunately have no more information to offer other then that."

*Elfriede hands the letter outward to give to Itory, then glaces around the library* 

"Quite a beautiful room you have, could lose myself for a while in here I'm sure."
*He looks back and smiles warmly*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-10*

Once Elfriede finishes speaking, Atalantia proudly steps forward, and quickly nods her head in acknowledgement of Afina.

“Hello Afina Tyndall, I have traveled long and far with the intent to form a symbol of alliance with you. Upon visiting the Callorian Kingdom, I had been informed that you reside in this tower. I want to make it clear that I have little to no knowledge on who you actually are or why you have chosen to stay here. Although I do know that I must gain this symbol of alliance and I must do so peacefully” *Atalantia tries to explain her case without going too heavily into detail.*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-11*

*Kailyn curtsied, head lowered and position held in respect of the princess. She knew of Callorian traditions, the introductions and manners that are taught among nobles, and she would use them to full effect.*

"It is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance Princess Afina of Laera." she gave a slight pause to raise herself back with the others. "I am but a maiden of the Callorian kingdoms, here for knowledge of the arcane arts. I am hopeful that you, a noble of Callora, may be willing to aid me on my quest. You may call me K."

*She rethinks to herself what cards she has in her sleeves. Perhaps it will be as easy asking, but she hasn't come this far by being an optimist.*

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

Itory take the letter from Efreide before stepping back to the front side of Afina' desk. With practiced motions he grabs the letter opener from the desk without taking his eye from his lady and the guests. He opens the envelope and confirms the letter is clear of any suspicious properties before giving it to Afina to read.

```
Dear Lady Tyndall, Princess of Laera of the Callorian Alliance,

My name is Morras Raive, Cardinal of Trisp. Your professor and our mutual friend Carya Witella has written me that despite the political challenges you wish to visit my city and learn about Lylalel's magic from those who understand it best. I do not boast when I say no other church nor study knows light magic the way we do here. 

I respect Carya Witella and given his earnest request I brought it to those who can allow a Callorian noble's presence into glorious Eraia. I am pleased to inform you enclosed in this letter are papers that will allow you to travel through Eraia to Trisp. While we cannot allow you to study with us formally, a cultural visit is welcome. We hope that after visiting with us you will take your newfound knowledge of Lylalel's light back to your home; for we want no misconceptions as to the source of the light magics you wish to use. 

As a wise youth, I am sure you noted the unusual curior for this message. Knight-Lieutenant Elfreide Faun comes highly recommended by a personal friend in the military. I asked my friend to provide a trusted Eraian escort for you in the off chance you encounter trouble on the road, Lylalel forbid you trouble in your travels either politically or criminal. I expected a group only to hear back that Knight-Lieutenant Elfreide would do the job better than any other. His orders detailing this objective are also enclosed, do pass them to him. If you wish to bring a few people of your own with you we understand your trepidation. So long as your party remains small the papers I've enclosed shall cover you and yours. 

Sincerely,

Morras Raive, Cardinal of Trisp.
```

Each of the documents Cardinal Morras mentioned are present in the envelope, each adorned with an official seal.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-11*

*He looks to Itory and nods and then steps forward to take the letter.*

*after reading the letter for himself he lets out a chuckle*

“Sending me is starting to make some sense now.”

*He looks back to Afina and offers another practiced bow* 

“Well it seems I'm to do your bidding and Guard you from all harm Lady Afina. I seems as though I'll be in pleasant company indeed for my trip back. Might I suggest setting out in the morn after you’ve gathered your things? Although I suppose if I am to stay might I ask to borrow a guest room for the night?”

*After Afina's Response Elfriede grumbles in his head a bit about the others coming along and sighs ever so slightly under his breathe. He's going to have to spend more time with that Lylallel forsaken Cat girl..*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-11*

1. Afina nodded at her guests respectfully, before taking the letter from Itory. She skimmed over it briefly, only if to confirm that it held what she thought it did, and passed it back. She hesitated, trying to remember what her father said when they received a visitor to their home. “Welcome, valued guests. I’m glad after so much time spent travelling that you have all made it to your… destination safely.” She cleared her throat, lacing her fingers together. “I’ll admit I’m surprised to have visitors for me specifically, people often come to this tower in search of my father. I guess the assumption is that the head of the Tyndall family would reside here, rather than his daughter.” She laughs softly, almost awkwardly. Receiving guests was her least favorite duty as a noble.

2. She turned to her first guest. “Knight-Lieutenant Elfriede, thank you for delivering such an important message. I’ve been waiting for these documents for a while now. I would be glad to travel back to Eraia under your protection.” She turned to her butler. “Itory, please send immediate word to my family that I will be departing in the morning,” she said with a nod. “As for your request of food and lodging, we can surely accommodate. Tyndall Tower was intended for family retreats, and surely has extra bed space somewhere. We will leave as soon as I am packed with a full night’s rest, of course.”

3. Afina then focused on the wolf laguz. “My second guest, I’m impressed to hear that you’ve travelled so far on your own! Though I do believe I’ve neglected to hear your name. What may I call you? Also…” Afina hesitates, glancing down and twiddling her thumbs together, before looking back up to address Atalantia. “I’m afraid I cannot at the moment offer you what you’re looking for. I’m sure you already know that the Symbol of Alliance isn’t something a family bestows freely. For the Tyndall family especially, it isn’t easily garnered, but it isn't impossible to receive, however…” she hesitated, drumming her fingers on the desk. “Though if you were to travel in my company back to Eraia, there may be a chance for us to forge a very strong bond in the process. I make no promises, but I ask, how am I able to give you my seal of approval without even knowing who I am?”

She takes a deep breath, before smiling and nodding. “I am able to provide you as well with lodging and food for the night, as I know you’ve travelled very far. I anticipate an answer for my proposal by the morning.”

4. Finally, Afina addresses her final guest, nodding in acknowledgement. “Welcome to my tower, K. I’m glad to see another person with such zest for learning so far away from home! I’ve missed that zealous enthusiasm that is so prevalent in Laera. Though, I am confused as to why you’ve travelled to me of all people for knowledge in the arcane arts. I may be the king’s daughter, and thereby equipped with the finest books, but surely the libraries of Laera would be of more help to you…” she said, furrowing her brows. “Nonetheless, it would discourteous of me to turn down an anxious pupil. If you so wish to learn from me, I invite you to travel with me to Eraia as well, and I can teach you what I know in our travels. I will provide food and a bed overnight for you as well, and anticipate an answer by morning.”

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-15*

*Kailyin didn't know what to think about this situation. Well she over-estimated the difficulty of it, that's for certain, but to be taught by a princess instead of a sage or proper mage. Is this a better situation? How much does she know? Where will she be departing to in Eraia?*

*She sighs from the thought of all the questions racing in her mind. Everything happened much faster than she anticipated.*

"Thank you for your offer princess," she states, calmly,  "and to be honest I am quite surprise. Although I am not one to say no to adventure, I was hoping you'd refer me to a sage or teacher to learn advanced magic that you may not even know. Also, if I am to accompany you, why will you be heading to Eraia?"

She pauses for a second and gives another sigh, "It is not my attention to be rude by your offer, and although I don't intend to sit around I believe that a teacher may help me, and help me help you in your task, even more."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-16*

In an embarrassed tone, Atalantia finally introduces herself, "Oh I am terribly sorry, I assumed I had already provided my name. You may call me Atalantia."

Atalantia then goes on to answer Afina's other statements
"perhaps you have mistaken me for a fool, for I know a symbol of alliance is not an easy one to obtain. It is true that an alliance will be hard to forge with one I do not know the nature of, However I was given a challenge and I am prepared to do what is necessary in order to complete it.  After all, the concept of challenges and proving my worth is no new concept for me. 

I will also gladly accept your offer of food and shelter, as long as I may be able to accompany you back to Eraia"

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Itory only raised an eyebrow when his lady Afina suggested traveling into a foreign country with only two strangers and an envoy of said country as guards. He considers it a mark of his professionalism; Many others would exclaim at their liege for such actions. 

Itory bows slightly when addressed. "I'll send a letter at once Milady. Shall I request additional guards from the Laera? It shouldn't take naught but a fortnight." he says. He waits patiently for Afina to reply, knowing she'll acknowledge him when there's a lull in conversation with the guests.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-17*

Despite the apology from  K, the corner of Afina's eye twitched with irritation, and she forced a smile. "No offense taken," she said, taking a book from her desk and flipping it open, and tracing her fingers along the pages. "In Laera, we are well aware of our own limitations as far as knowledge goes. Nonetheless, I believe that the nobility may be the most equipped to help you in your learning endeavors. After all,” she said, glancing down at the pages of her book, “a noble taught by many scholars is smarter than any individual scholar on their own." 

With that, the lettering on the pages began to glow and shine faintly, and light pooled along the crease of the book’s pages, seemingly coming from the words themselves. Though only a small light source, it radiated brightly, and shimmered with iridescent intensity. Afina looked up haughtily.

“As for what I will be doing in my travels, the letter clearly indicates that no such formal training can be provided, but I believe the cultural experience can help me strengthen the proficiency I already have with my magic. Few Laerans have been to Callora, so naturally it’s a very unique experience to bring back to my people.” She nodded, slamming the book shut and snuffing out the light like a candle. 

“Anyways, Itory, no guards will be necessary, this is a simple excursion to Eraia, and though I know it isn’t the most peaceful of times, extra guards would delay us by far too much. I think a small party can surely protect themselves, and travel faster with much better cover. A simple notification is all that my family requires, thank you.”

She turned back to her guests with a newfound confident energy. She smiled, “And if there are no other questions, I invite you to explore my library and speak with me about your travels, or to speak with Itory about your accommodations for the night. Otherwise, the next meal is in two hours.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-17*

*Elfriede nods approvingly and smirks*

"Thank you for your kindness, hospitality and access to your wealth of books, although I'm surprised to find you so trusting of strangers Lady Tyndall." 

*He places one hand on his hilt non-threateningly, glances around the room with narrowed eyes and gives a sort of disapproving frown at the other guests.*

*He then steps away towards the shelves of Non-Fiction books and starts to finger through them and stops on a book about modern military tactics and retrieves it. Faun then glaces around to make sure noones looking and retrieves a book from the Fiction section as well titled: Forbidden love*
*Elfriede takes a seat on one of the comfortable reading chairs that lavish the room and starts to read and thinks to himself, (I'll finish these before bed.)*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-17*

*Atalantia's ears perk up in excitement after observing the indication that she may be able to make progress on completing her challenge.*

*Speaking towards Afina, Atalantia  states,* "I can assure you that I am more than capable of handling whatever danger may come our way during the travel to Eraia. While I may not look it, I am in fact the strongest member of my pack, and I am positive that I am stronger than any guard your people may send. Therefore it is in my honor and best interest to ensure our safety,  especially if it can lead me closer to forming a symbol of alliance with you."

*Atalantia bows her head towards Afina, and then proceeds to browse the library's selection of books. Atalantia searches for any book revolving the Wynne people and their tradition of competing for the title of ruler of Wynne.*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

*Kailyn mouth widened from  Afina's magic. Before she knew it, the glow faded and the other two visitors wandered while she still stood there. You could see a smirk on her mouth; she felt that she might've offended the princess with her words, the princess' actions and speech made that ring true, but she saw something that gave her a direction to go on.*

*The knowledge and power shown to Kailyn made following Afina her mission, but what made her enjoy it more was the princess' slight hostility, the need to be right, a slight spunk that made her knew she'd enjoy her travels. She moves up to Afina.*

"I can't wait to join you on your journey," Kailyn says with a small smirk and toss of her hair. The formalities were over as Kailyn walked over to the bookshelf to fetch a selection of books on magic and history. She'll be reading until supper and finish up before heading to bed.

**Bill** - *2017-10-19*

Itory's gaze holds on Afina for a moment after her answer to him. He breaks it with a small bow.

"I shall send word at once then Milady." he says as he steps out the door, leaving behind the four new companions.

.
..
...

The beds in Tyndall Tower made for easy sleeping that night. One would think people with a reputation for reading in bed like the Tyndall's would want a hard, uncomfortable mattress so they won't fall asleep while reading. Reality is completely contrary to that, with soft, cloud like beds.

Itory has resupplied each of the traveler's rations and packs, saving each of you a trip out to replace the perishables used on your trip here. He insists that it is how a guest should be treated in a royal house and takes no repayment. He does however, mention that Lady Tyndall is very important to both her family and her staff; protecting her should not be taken lightly. While he says so lightly, one look at his eyes make it clear how serious he is. He also notes to each of that they should keep in mind they are traveling with a Princess and must act accordingly.

Itory provides a brand new travel pack for Afina in the morning, loaded with the best money can buy. Amazingly, he's managed to keep it light enough that it's comfortable even for the library dwelling Afina. While he wishes her the best of luck, he doesn't see her off with a smile. Instead he wrings his hands behind his back and his brow is furrowed slightly. 

Leaving Theanovene is easy and the trail out of town is well traveled. Soon you begin to approach the border of Eraian controlled territory, made obvious by the guard station built on the road. Over half a dozen military men mill about the station, and the can already see your approach.

(ooc: This round is more of an establishing shot kind of thing. Describe your traveling attire and appearance, monologue your thoughts from the road thus far if you have any to write, or even thoughts about the others in the party. If you wish to expand on your conversation with Itory before leaving the tower, that can be an aside as can any conversation you'd like to have over dinner or in the late evening. Could even monologue a scene in the tower at night if you wanted to.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

*In his room he had been given so generously by Lady Tyndall he undressed into sleepwear carefully taking off each piece of armour. Stopping midway to glace down at his tail. Remnant of his Lagu heritage of which he was.... (ashamed?). He brushed his hand through it massaging out the cramped tissue from being cooped up. He finished changing and got into bed and stared at the ceiling and sighed. Then rolled over and slept well that night despite being lost in his thoughts.*
---
*With the full pack on his back he glanced at Itory. "Were you ever in the military? You sort of give me the vibe of an experienced soldier. Thank you for your assistance today. I promise to Lylalel that I will watch over the Lady diligently, although she seems to also be able to take care of herself."
*Elfriede leans inward a bit toward Itory and talks softer*
"I'll also be watching the others...pray they try anything."

*He gives Itory a nod and rejoins the readying companions*
---
*On the road Elfriede was wearing his usual travel gear, Duelist armour emblazened with the Symbol of Eraia with a rapier and dagger at each side. Walking with his usual one hand on the pommel posture.*

"Ah.", Faun said as they began to approach the guard tower.
"The border guards, we should have no trouble passing through Lady Tyndall, I'll just have a word with them when we get there."
*Elfriede glances back at her, nods and smiles.*
"I might even outrank them all~."
*Elfriede has a short laugh to himself.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

Afina returned to her quarters early, mentally exhausted from the day. Between the failure of her developing spell, the tedious duties of nobility, and the challenges to her authority, she was fatigued. With a huff, she collapsed face down onto bed. Being a princess was hard. Turning her face to see the window, she stared at the moon. She wondered if the people of Laera had forgotten about her departure by now. 
---
Afina stood in her underclothes, hands on her hips, frowning at her dresser. She wondered if she should wear the royal blue of Laera in her travels, or try to remain more conspicuous with a neutral gray ensemble. She settled on a gray, tunic-style dress, with black pants and tan boots. Logistically, the outfit was perfect, but it felt so wrong. She carefully pinned a blue cloak around her shoulders, the family emblem on the pin glistening in the morning sunlight. Spinning and posing in the mirror, Afina felt even more confident about her excursions to Eraia. This trip would finally make her qualified to take her title as inheritor to the throne.

Walking downstairs to meet with her companions in the library, she noted the small details of Tyndall Tower. How the bricks lay, where light filtered in through cracks in the windows, the distinct dryness that allowed for the Tyndalls to preserve so many books. At the foot of the stairs, she encountered Itory, who brandished a new travel pack for her. She gasped, thanking him profusely, before noting her party already gathered in the library. Realizing she was the one everyone was waiting for, she hurriedly thanked Itory and rushed to join them. 
---

The weather was clear and bright as the company travelled to Eraia. Afina walked with her fingers laced together, inspecting her surroundings. Travelling wasn’t new to her; she HAD been sent to live to Theanovene for some time now. She turned back to examine her entourage. How they walked, what they carried. It was interesting how their articles reflected how they were as people. She glanced at her own attire. Formal, yet simple and clearly proud of her heritage. Quite true. 

She glanced at the laguz in her company. The only assumptions she made about the laguz people were those that had been validated by science. She wondered if that meant that they had inexplicable urges to howl at the moon, or to lick their bodies clean with their tongue. Laguz WERE proven to take on characteristics of their animal counterparts. But no that would be dumb, she had never seen a laguz lick... Afina’s deep (and, clearly, complex) reverie was interrupted as Elfriede announced that they should have no trouble getting past the border guards. 

She nodded, thanking him for his assistance, and even laughing politely at his side comment. But furthermore, Afina still vaguely considered whether she HAD seen a cat laguz lick themselves clean.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-23*

Kailyn stands by her bed, her supplies organized on the sheets. She tossed out the dress that she wore on arrival, instead wearing a green tunic with light grey pants and leather shoes, an outfit given to her during her travels. There was other parts to the ensemble, but she didn't think it was wise to dress like a gypsy.  It was much easier to walk around and was much less flashy. She kept the ribbon from her hair and packed in her bag, thinking it was a nice accessory.

She began packing and equipping her possessions along with what was given to her by Itory, including a small lockpick set, a couple of daggers kept around her waist for protection, a book for light reading, and- *sigh*. She looks at the small package wrapped with leather and twine. She reminisces a bit and begins to wonder, should I just leave this in Theanovene? There was no where she could leave it and she didn't have anyone she trusted enough, but at the same time it could get her into trouble; although she questions how much the rest of her party trusts her anyway...

She stores the package among the rest of her gear, keeping it hidden, and began to head downstairs. She looked around for a bit, not really noting how much nicer this tower looks on the inside versus its bland exterior. Perhaps she would've stayed a few more days if she had the time. In hindsight she always has the time, but she finds something off with the idea of staying in Theanovene longer than she has to. Besides, she has some magic to learn.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-23*

After consuming a giant meal Atalantia thought it’d be best to depart to her room so that she may recover before the journey ahead. 
Atalantia observed the soft, cloud-like bed that was provided to her. She was far more used to firm bedding arrangements found in her clan, that were often covered with blankets made from the fur of hunted animals. To a point, the soft bedding made Atalantia uneasy.
*Nobles must be very careless and trusting… my people would never rely on such comfortable beds. If I were to sleep on such a comfortable bedding, I would surely fall into deep slumber, which would make me susceptible to harm* Atalantia thought to herself.

Atalantia then looked towards her Uinpeng clothing in a heap on the floor. *I keep seeing these southerners in heavy steel armor. How could they possibly move around in such an outfit* she thinks to herself. Atalantia is much more used to the lighter hide armor that is traditionally used in her tribe. Made from the pelts of the native bears and elk that call her forests home. The hide armor she wears is engraved with a norse pattern that is only made for the most elite fighters of her clan. Beneath the armor is a wool tunic to prevent chafing as well as keep her warm in the cold north. Through her travels south she has been neglecting to wear the tunic due to the warmer climate. Atalantia wears nothing beneath her armor other than the tunic since her most intense travel is done in wolf form so now, without the tunic her skin is bare and occasionally draws the eyes of onlookers. Her wrists are protected by the same hide bracers that have a similar norse pattern on them.

Her lower body is surprisingly unprotected by contrast. Beneath her waist she only has leather boots, lined on the inside with fox fur hunted in her home forests, and thinner pants  made of wool rings that allow for a perfect balance of mobility and warmth, which fit snugly on her legs demonstrating her muscular figure. Around her waist is a thick leather strap that has two loops on each side for storing her leaf-shaped blades. Each loop has a button latch to keep the swords in place; however, the swords are not stored in a scabbard so they are often in need of maintenance to prevent corrosion and non-battle related wear. 


After analyzing both the bedding and her own equipment, Atalantia thought it’d be best to set up a bed on the floor.  Atalantia spread out her tunic, and slept peacefully for the duration of the night before the journey ahead.

The next morning, Atalantia put on all her equipment and braced herself for the travel. She was looking forward to showing her allies what it is like to travel as a wolf, as well as become one more step closer to completing her challenge of forming a symbol of alliance with Afina. During all of this time, Atalantia was mentally preparing  which of her many songs to sing first during the course of the journey.

**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

As you come close to the guard house half a dozen of the men charge out and form a half circle in front of your group. 

"Hold! Who are you and what brings you through to Eraia?" One shouts. The group of soldiers tighten up as he yells. A new soldier comes up from behind the group, an older man wearing pieces of heavy armor with dents in it and with a scruffy mustache. He looks over your group quickly then taps the soldier who spoke on the shoulder.

"Stand down boys, that's one of ours. An Eraian Knight-Lieutenant wouldn't be traveling with bandits." he says with a gruff voice.

"But sir, what if that's not his uniform?" the soldier from before asks without taking his eyes of Elfreide.

"A good thought my boy, but I can vouch for Sir Elfreide. He passed through this very station a week ago." the man says with a chuckle in his voice. He gives a nod to Elfreide acknowledging the fellow soldier. The leader's men set their spears down and visibly relax. "The lot of you can head back to the station, I'll handle the rest." he says. They each give a short bow and say *"In the service of Lylalel"* quietly. He nods back and says *"May she guide you"*. The remaining soldier walks up closer to them.

"I'm Ransford Gale, commander of this garrison. I apologize for the hostile response." he says, bowing in the direction of the two women. "There's been trouble with a group of laguz bandits recently, just over a day ago a caravan carrying some ancient texts was attacked and looted. We can't be too careful out here." He stops for a moment, realizing something. "Ah, not to worry about it miladies." he adds. "They've yet to harass anyone outside a trade caravan. Additionally you've mostly past their active area; the last path into that section of the woods is naught but a mile from here."

He clears his throat. "Right then, we've held you up long enough and my story telling won't get you where you're going. Follow me over to the station and we'll check out those papers, though I don't expect anything to be out of order." he says. As he leads you towards the station he turns to Elfreide specifically. "I know not your itinerary, and you clearly have business to be done, but get you the chance tell someone from the church we've figure out where these bandits have holed up. Manpower's been scarce with the Drecian conflict and all that, but if they can spare a group for just a day we'll be able to drive them off." 

Sitting down on the other side of a small counter in the center of the station, he picks up a quill and smiles. "Now then, pass me the paperwork to read, I'll answer any questions ya have, and we won't hold you up any longer."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-23*

*Initially lost in thought about family and tradition from his conversation with Afina Elfriede had to snap himself out of it when they approached the guards*

*Elfriede initially tenses thinking something had happened and then releases once the commander calmed the troops*

*he does a slight bow to the Commander*

“Hahaha, I know my party is a bit strange this time upon returning to Eraia, but the Laguz came on the word of my escortee and I had no reason to deny her. I understand the response but no trouble was caused so no harm done and I thank you for your kindness.”

*Elfriede glances back to the party*

“I mean… hmm… *Elfriede pauses for a moment* I’d normally offer assistance, but I don't want to deny my orders to return the Lady. I’ll be sure to let them know of the situation when we arrive in the capitol. Does anyone else have any questions?”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-25*

Afina, partially hidden by Elfriede and flanked by Kailyn and Atalantia, inspected the armor of the older man, noting the battle damage and his scruffy appearance. His confident and self-assured posture made it obvious he was high in rank, and the quick Eraian exchange between himself and Elfriede confirmed as much. Following the commander, Afina took the papers from her travel pack, flipping through them to seem busy and deserving of entry. There was no reason for them to be denied, after all. She glanced at her laguz companions. Perhaps picking her travelling company had been a mistake; they arose much more suspicion in a group such as this. Even if it did mean she had a chance at forming important political alliances as well as garnering a potential pupil.

Coming to the forefront of the counter, Afina hands the commander the papers. “You said bandits, sir?”  she blurts out, intrigued at the idea. “Oh! I-uh...Forgive me. I am Afina Tyndall, Princess to the kingdom of Laera.” She nods her head, reflectively tensing up to the perfect posture she had learned to keep in her youth. “And I am the escortee designated within those papers. I studied with a clergyman of your kingdom for many years. It is an honor to finally be traveling here.” 

Afina hesitates, looking once more at her company. It would be foolish to take a detour so early in their travels. No proper leader would derail the journey so early on. “I’m sorry to hear about the troubles plaguing you with the bandits. We will most certainly send word to the church about this matter. If you don’t mind me asking, sir, but what is the state of affairs in Trisp at the moment? The nature of our excursion is detailed within the papers, but I’m curious to see how you yourself find matters.”

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

*The moment guards start running towards the party, Atalantia stops her joyous howling and rapidly transforms back into her humanized form. If necessary, she would combat these guards if they were to pose any sort of a threat, or if they were to halt progress in the mission at hand* 

*Atalantia becomes slighlty perturbed by the fact that the guards are suspicious that both Kailyn and her are involved with the laguz bandits.*

"Surely these laguz people must have some sort of justification for their actions. If not, then they are clearly representing my people in a poor light. It seems to me that most of you nobles have your own misconceptions about us" *Atalantia states towards the guards and the party.*

*Facing Afina, Atalantia goes on to state,* "While I do believe it is important to get you to Eraia promptly, I can't stand by idly as my people are being discriminated against or if these bandits are acting against the morals and values that my people hold true. I would like to go and investigate so that we may bring this bandit trouble to an end. This would also give us some influence with Eraia and may give us all an opportunity to cooperate to solve a proble, which would be necessary in an alliance. Solving this conflict may also allow us all to come to a better understanding of each other."

*Atalantia then turns back to the guards* "Do you have any leads on where these bandits might be located? Or any information that might allow us to locate them easier or find a solution to this issue?"

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

Ransford answers your questions while thumbing through the paper work he's received from Afina. 

"Trisp is on the other side of the kingdom milady, close to the western sea. News about Trisp doesn't make it out this way often. Well, that's not only because of the distance." He pauses for a moment, then remembering he's not talking to locals, continues. "Trisp is a monastery of sorts. The whole town centers around Lylalel and the manifestation of her light. If you don't have a vested interest in Lylalel's magic, nothing coming from Trisp will really interest you."

Ransford looks up at Atalania's statement. Despite the even tone of a service man in his voice, one look at his eyes reveals he wasn't fond of her words. "I don't see any justification for robbing unarmed caravaneers, be you two eared or or four. Worry you not, no one's opinions shall hold you up here. This guard station is right lacking in nobility," he turns to Afina, "Present company excluded of course."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"Perhaps you didn't hear me when I announced that I would like to find a solution to the bandit problem. I am requesting any information that you may have on the bandits, so that I can investigate further and bring this issue to an end. If they are attacking without reason they will be put down, however I am not going to make that assumption on the word of guards who can't take the time to acknowledge me" Atalantia states fiercely having been ignored for the most part. 

Atalantia then faces her party and shows them the determination in her eyes. "I wish not to cause conflict, but this is an issue we MUST resolve. I will always defend my kind, and if they are still acting against the interests of the majority and display a poor image of our kind, I will take matters in my own hands to stop it."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

*Elfriede glances back at his furry companions, thinking (and not for the first time) it was indeed a bad idea taking them along.*


*He glances over at Afina, sighing with his eyes alone.*


“Maybe if we start walking she'll follow us.”


“Come on then, we can always go hunting for the bandits after we make our stop in Eraia and as long as I don't have any orders against it I intend to return. I want to see the bandits cleansed as  much as any of us.” 


*Impatiently rolled his shoulder both as a tick and to stretch*


“Besides we're already at the border, there can't be that much more journey ahead of us.”

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn sighed. Perhaps it would've been better to keep going forward, but no. Too much had been said.  She put herself in front of all, letting the crowd circle around her.*

"Sir, I agree that robbing caravaners is unjust, but what makes you believe it is just laguz?" Kailyn paused. "The fact is, my party consists of laguz as well, and I feel that the only trouble brought is of your own words. For am I not a maiden of my own tree and Atalantia of royalty as well. Of course, you wouldn't know that since you dared not ask a question, only to throw us aside."

Kailyn then turns to Elfriede, only feeling shame for the knight. "As for you, what is your duty? Are you not to serve and protect? To die for your cause? And yet all I hear is heading to Eraia, avoiding this quest. What will happen when your master gives you another task, as I am sure both you and I are sure he will give. Will you avoid this task still? What cowardice! Avoiding the task at hand for your own self and position."

Kailyn eyes glared down and Elfriede once more, "And near the border? What lies do you speak! Did this man not say that Trisp was on the other side of the kingdom? And yet you lie to my face. To Atalantia. To all of us."

Kailyn's final stare was given to Afina. She paused again, regaining her breath. She gained focus from her last two spouts, ready to speak to royalty once more. "Did you not say, 'If no one aspires to be ruler then we'll live in a world full of weak authority thrust into the ruling position'?" She lets the words sink in.
"If that be the case, then is it not as bad letting those of weak authority wander the plains and roads, ransacking those who serve you and the kingdom? Do you not serve the people of this kingdom as we serve you?"

Kailyn then bows. "Please Princess Afina, do not dishonor your name nor my name as a laguz. Let us stop this banditry now."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

Afina silently opened the door, head bowed, the slightest bit embarrassed about the altercation that had occurred previously. Expectant eyes turned towards her, some hopeful and others more cross. “I have come to a decision,” she said, looking at the commander. 

“There are many factors to consider in deciding whether to proceed to Eraia or to halt our travels and assist the patrol with their raider issue.That being said, no proper leader would reroute their company so early into their travels. Strategically, this isn’t our fight to fight right now, as we have a duty to fulfill in Trisp.”

“However, a leader doesn’t rule with their head alone. The heart plays a role as well, and it’s only proper and just that we dispose of the bandits before anyone else can be harmed. The simple fact of the matter is that justice isn’t always convenient. There are many factors to consider when weighing the options.” 

She walked forward, proceeding to the counter where the commander still sat, arms folded. His gruffy, confident appearance was familiar in an odd sort of way. She lifted her chin, facing away from her company and solely addressing the commander. Perhaps out of fear of seeing their reactions, or the need she felt to prove herself to this commander. “Therefore, I have decided we will remove the bandits from the bothersome place they currently occupy.”

She then turned to face her party, a mix of shock, approval, and miscellaneous other reactions drifting between them. “We have the combined magic, physical, and tactical strength to resolve this issue now. It would save a lot of lives and bolster our reputation among the Eraians. This shouldn’t take long. Any last input before we officially detour our mission?”

**Bill** - *2017-10-30*

Ransford's face is still. The only thing to move is his eyes, slowing tracing from Afina, to the two laguz, and finally to Elfreide. His stony look doesn't soften as he speaks.

"I don't recall asking any of you to go bandit hunting. At the most I asked you to relay a message did I not?" he says. He doesn't expect an answer, his tone most assuredly rhetorical. "Eraia does not need foreigners, led alone foreign nobility to deal with it's problems." he straightens Afina's papers by tapping them against his desk. 

Ransford doesn't look at your party as he stands up. "Your papers are in order. Do what you wish when you leave, and I am required to warn you to avoid the path into the woods on the west, no more than a mile further south. There are..." his brow twitches slightly. "Bandits, down that trail. Be safe in your travels, may Lylalel light your path." He finishes, and turns on his heel. He nods to the other guardsman in the room as he steps through the door into the rest of the station. 

The remaining guardsman looks at the party only once before snapping to attention as he presumably guards the inner section of the guardhouse from unauthorized entry. 

(ooc: You can spend more time talking or wrap up your time at the guard house in this round, just mention where you're going next and I'll transition in the next round.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-30*

*Elfriede sighs and rolls his eyes a bit*

*He taps the commander's shoulder before he leaves*

"Hey, would you send word via the next courier and tell them why we're behind schedule. I'd appreciate it."

*He about-faces and walks over to Afina and passes her, eyeing her all the way*

*Elfriede stops in the doorway not turning his head*

"Well I'm ready when you are... Lets have it done then. We've more sunlight before we have to make camp for the night. I'd like to make as much progress as we can tonight. Maybe even get this whole ordeal done before sunset."

*He re-adjusts his supplies and stretches and walks away.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-02*

Afina's face begins to flush red hot with embarrassment. She bows her head as the commander rises, mumbling a curt “thank you, sir” as he walks away. With a sigh, she turns on her heel, gaze fixated on the floor. “You heard him, let’s get moving,” she says, fingers digging into the straps on her pack as she follows Elfriede out the door. 

This was ridiculous! The Eraian guards should have been thankful. Why did they act so offended? And worse over, disappointed. What did she do? It felt like she had to fight her party defending what she wanted to do, only to cave in to what’s “right” and be passive-aggressively admonished! She rolled her eyes. Duty comes before all is right. She had always stuck to her guns in the past. Now, the one time she gives the others the benefit of the doubt, she embarasses herself. 

She haughtily glanced at her laguz companions. If science was to be understood, which naturally, it was, the laguz tend to take the traits of the animals they associate with. There was a reason that cats and wolves were always the sneaky antagonists in the stories. She had to be more on her guard, the real world was clearly not as straightforward as the stories she used to read.

In front of her walked Elfriede, his usual (no doubt, practiced) military posture not betraying a single thought. An individual of principle and duty, he took the charge of protecting her very seriously. Perhaps he was the only one playing for “Team Afina”, as it were. Atalantia only wanted her for the seal she could potentially bestow, and K’s intentions alone were wholly unclear beyond simple “learning”. Afina sped up her pace to catch up to Elfriede, deeming she needed more information before trusting the laguz in her company. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Atalantia trying to talk to her, and she mumbled a few half-hearted "of course" and "okay"s in response.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-11-02*

"You know, you don't have to ask for help in order to receive it. Explaining the problem to 'foreigners' is enough of a call for help in my opinion. I do thank you, for pointing us in the right direction towards the bandits at the very least" Atalantia says in response to Ransford's comments. *Atalantia could sense the sass in his voice, which made her quite irritable*

*Atalantia looks towards the party, and nods her head, showing that she is ready to depart towards the bandits. She was looking forward to resolving this bandit issue; hopefully this will allow the laguz to be seen in a better light. As it is, Atalantia knew very well that her noble companions judged her and K for being laguz (or at least people of a more "wild" nature). Atalantia had to demonstrate to her companions that she was indeed a great asset to the party, and one that could be trusted.*

*As the party begins to depart towards the trail with the bandits, Atalantia sternly looks towards Afina*
"I couldn't help but notice before that you called yourself the 'leader' of our party. Are we not all equals here?"

Noticing that Afina isn't listening she grabs her and turns her to face herself, "Listen to me when I am talking to you! I can't stand rudeness like that from anybody, let alone a noble who should know better."

"It's an important fact that in an alliance, the members must treat each other with trust and fairness. How can we reach this trust and fairness if you view yourself as the 'leader' of us all? 

Although I do thank you greatly for accepting my plea to take on the bandits. I feel as if this task will prove to be very valuable towards you and your desire to learn about light magic. 

I do not view you as our 'leader,'  I hope you didn't *mistake* our discussion as a request for a leader's decision. It was an effort to convince an ally to accompany myself and K on a mission. You don't make decisions for me, and the sooner you understand that the faster we will become good friends."

*Atalantia then looks towards K with the same serious expression* 
"Also, please do not encourage the princess in her delusion of grandeur. I certainly do not 'serve' Afina, or anyone for that matter. We are a party, and we must start to treat each other that way. If we convince each other that one of us if better than the other, our party will break apart and we will surely fail our missions."

*Atalantia then looks to Elfriede continuing her serious expression*
"I understand that you are on orders to protect Afina, and I will not ask you to disrespect your organization by denying the fact that you are technically subordinate to her. But, I do ask you to offer the same respect of not pushing your organization's ideas on us, and at the very least treat K and I as equals for our journey."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-02*

Kailyn approaches Afina, tapping on her shoulder for attention. Kailyn gives a slight smile, leaning forward Afina's face.

"Your words towards Ransford rang more true than before."

She waited for Afina to give a sign of recognition to her words, and waited a moment after to speak again.

"However, please remember that you aren't the only one here. Our lives are also on the line as well as yours."

Kailyn then moves up aside her, looking at the road ahead instead.

"You said you were a suitable teacher for the numerous teachers that you had, when instead your teachers were suitable for their experience that they gained through a lifetime of thinking and communication. In the grand scheme of things, we are all teaching each other for a better idea, towards a harder goal."

Kailyn then look softly into Afina's eyes.

"Don't be afraid to look at us as equals."

Kailyn then moved aside, following the rest of the pack on the road. She heard atalantia's speech, and although outspoken, certainly rang some truth as well. Kalyn came here for a teacher and now she doesn't know why she is here. Perhaps she is moving along without purpose, or maybe wanting to aid those who are in need?

*Only two things were in Kailyn's mind now. The first being the bandits that should be taken care of. The second...*

*"This need not be a human nobility versus laguz issue, don't get any ideas."*

*Kailyn doesn't know how to respond from this argument. Beyond anything else, Elfriede ignored the issue and Afina ignored their voice. What did Afina mean when saying "not be wise in Eraian territory" to laguz give a verdict?*

*Kailyn has dealt with this before, and she doesn't want to deal with it again.*

**Bill** - *2017-11-02*

```
Location: Deep in the Woods
Characters: Afina, Atalania, Kailyn, Elfreide
```
Not even an hour passes before the path into the woods Ransford told you of reveals itself. Were the group not warned about it would easily pass as no more than a hiking trail. For the first hour of the walk the path feels like one as well, no skulls hanging from crosses or bodies strung up in the trees. The path is anything but straight; between that and the tree's blocking most of the sky you'll need a compass to know which end is up, let alone north. 

After that hour of winding this way and that, you start to notice signs of people, despite how deep into the woods you are. Cut marks on the trees, boot prints in the dirt, and other clues. The foliage seems fuller this far in as well, blocking the sun's rays as it begins it's downward descent. Yet as you turn another bend you can see your goal as plan as day.

No more than 300 feet away you can see a small wooden building, made almost entirely of planks and not exactly well built. It's a quirky building, as it's all the same color wood and that makes it look fake or maybe even unnatural. The tree line even seems to shy away from the building, ending a good 30 feet before the building itself. Behind the building you can see the tops of trees and the sun as it starts to set.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-02*

*Elfriede's hands move to his weapon hilts and he glances at Atalantia*

"At least take your hands off her..." *Elfriede grimaces*

"You've spoken your mind, now lets continue."

-------
(arriving at the site of the building)

"Hmm, I'm for thinking that there is some deception afoot here. Definitely be ready for anything as we approach the building. Situations like these they might have someone that looks meek distract you while the rest of the group flanks." *Elfriede whispers to the group*

*His hands drift again to his weapon hilts which he quietly draws; Rapier in his right hand and parrying dagger with curved hilt wrist guards for catching enemy swords and turning them away*

"Although I'm no assassin, sneaking up may not be an option."

*Elfriede readies his weapons and goes to begin his slow approach to the building*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-02*

Afina frowns at Atalantia, brows knit. “Forgive me, though I know your matters are urgent to address, I am currently occupied with sorting out my own thoughts. It’s very jarring to have been admonished for doing the right thing, a thing of which I did not even want to engage in to begin with.” 

She clears her throat, turning her gaze to make eye contact with Atalantia. “Furthermore, know that I don’t make empty assertions that I’m the leader. I am the entity that unites us in one cause, am I not?” She points at each party member in turn. “Elfriede's escort mission? Your quest for a symbol of alliance? K’s search for knowledge? Was it not my door you knocked on? Therefore, if I am the entity that brings us all together, then, shouldn’t it be true that I represent the interests of my party the best, with fairness and consideration to all?” By then, each member of their travelling company was listening to Afina in some capacity or another. This was no longer a conversation between the two girls.

“Elfriede and I have a duty to uphold; he to serve his kingdom, and I to serve mine. And to shirk our responsibilities for a detour we could live without taking... “ Afina shakes her head. “Of course you want to extinguish the laguz that give your race a bad name. I don’t understand it, and as a human probably never will. And yet, as a leader, I ruled that we would travel together to defeat these bandits as it were. Not because I want to, and not because it serves any purpose for me. But because it is just and fair to do so. And I don’t feel like this sacrifice of personal preference over “fairness” was appreciated very much. Which... is natural for a noble leader, of course. No one thanks you when that’s your position. So I shouldn’t expect any less.”

Taking out a book, Afina begins to thumb through it, as a signal that the conversation is clearly over, at least for the moment. “I also don’t appreciate being touched as such,” she adds with a frown, hand hovering over the side of her face. “Nobles exchange pleasantries, not physicalities.”

With a tap on the shoulder, Afina turns to K, closing her book for the moment. The softer words of her cat laguz companion are a more familiar tone of voice. Her father’s consol spoke to their king with a similar imploring and open tone. Afina even manages a smile. “I’m not afraid to trust you. Believe me. Laerans see discrimination as a form of ignorance, after all.”

Afina marched along the path with her book open, intently studying the pages. She had long lost track of where they were by now, trusting her more keen companions to have a better idea than herself. Mumbling to herself and her fingers tracing the pages, her book glowed with a golden light. A waste of spell paper, sure, but there were many more books where this one came from. Burning up one page meant there were still hundreds to be used. The golden hue of the setting sun masked the golden light from her own book, but nonetheless, it shone brilliantly. She halts abruptly, slamming the book shut, as Elfriede addresses their party.


“A bandit hideout? Really? This has more the appearance of a vacation home, if that.” she says, squinting at the house. “I concur though, truly something we should approach with caution.” Afina turns the pages of her book, fingers landing on a defensive light magic spell. Should the situation become dire, Afina had a small dagger in a sheath at the small of her back. The Tyndalls were diplomats first, but they understood the value of a good contingency plan. “Do we just… sneak in?”

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-11-06*

(ooc: tldr since we should have had an aside before this but I got busy with life lol) "You may be the entity that we all have in common, but that does not mean you best represent our interests. K's interest is to learn magic from you, which you have yet to do anything but have her doubt your capability to do so. My interest is to eventually become the ruler of Wynne, which would benefit from a *partnership* with you, not subordination. And although Elfriede's interests are a mystery to me other than following his orders, I am at least wise enough to admit that I don't speak for him. You are being quite stubborn on this point when at least half the party agrees you are not our leader. A leader needs those that will follow her, you are not one such person." Atalantia says towards Afina. 
-------

Atalantia transforms back into her wolf form and storms in front of the group howling a travel song the party has never heard before. (ooc: which sounds eerily similar to the chorus of "MF by AWOLNATION")

Walking ahead of the group, Atalantia stops abruptly once she notices a small wooden cabin in the distance. Rather than preparing her weapons as Afina and Elfriede did, Atalantia wishes to enter the situation diplomatically. She does not want to automatically assume that the people in this cabin are the bandits, or are people who wish to cause harm. 

"Ah that's interesting. If you all can hold off on the weapons for now, I think that'd be for the best. We do not know the nature of these people or if they even are the bandits" Atalantia says to the party.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-06*

Kailyn becomes more concerned with Afina's words more and more. She hoped more from this exchange, but instead felt more disdain from the mention of discrimination. Kailyn initially meant her ability as leadership from her previous words, but perhaps Afina now sees a problem with discrimination, or maybe it was a confusion of words. Either way, Kailyn only sees Afina's growing ignorance in multiple fronts.

*"Perhaps this was a mistake." Kailyn thought, "Although I came to learn magic, they journey itself has... turned for the worst. The issues can't be dropped, but should be discussed with more patience on both fronts. However, if the issue of discrimination continues..."*

Kailyn fears the worse, unsure of what she should do if things are to go south. She has no tolerance over racism and has only let it partially slide due to her opinions on Afina. Perhaps she should just return to Theanovene and try again, she'll see as time goes by.
---------
As the party marched forward to the hideout, Kailyn begins to think up a plan, giving small glares and snickers as they approach closer. She hears Afina's and Elfriede's words, thinking to sneak in first. While she appreciates this plan, Kailyn hasn't had fun in quite some time.

"Please, if I may." Kailyn interjects, giving a mischievous grin. "Allow me to go ahead and at least distract the bandits one way or another. If I seem to be in trouble, just sneak in and attack. If not, then attack when the time is right."

Kailyn then begins to take her steps forward into the compound, shooing the rest of the party to hide as she slowly approaches.
(ooc: I am leaving Kailyn approaching the bandit hideout for next round in case someone wants to try and stop her.)

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

Kailyn is witness to an amazing site as she approaches the shack. As the slight incline levels off she can see that the shack is backed by the edge of a cliff. Below the massive trees of the forest continue, yet the tops don't rise above the cliff. It gives off a distinct feeling of flying. The view is made all the more impressive by the sun sinking behind the trees beyond the cliff face, tinting the world an autumnal color. 

The shack itself is as nondescript as before. To be frank, it comes off as an eyesore to this glorious view. The boards of the house are in fact made from the same type of tree, weakening the contrast of the house. If not for the brass doorknob on the front door it'd be hard to differentiate the door from the wall. There are no windows on the front side of the shack.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-11-07*

Atalantia notices K walking ahead of the party in hopes to lure the bandits out of their hideout so that the party could surprise attack. Noticing this, Atalantia knew she had to stop K; such an act by K would go against Atalantia's desire to enter the situation diplomatically. The entire party seemed to rush into the conclusion that this *hideout* belonged to the bandits, even though it could belong to completely innocent and unrelated people. And even if they are the bandits, entering through a front door without any real plan would surely pose a danger to the party (and it is very crucial to protect Afina so that Elfriede's mission is fulfilled, K can learn magic, and Atalantia can form an alliance).

Atalantia hurries towards K, and proceeds to grab her wrists so that she can turn K to face her.
 "Slow down there K! I think it would be best to analyze this situation and not go in for the surprise attack. The nobles seem to hold  harsh judgements against our Laguz people. If we were to make the assumption that the people who live in this *hideout*  are in fact the  laguz bandits who wish to cause harm, wouldn't we be no different from the nobles? If we wish to end the discrimination against our people we must prove our worth and that we can handle situations diplomatically. Otherwise it'll be easy for others to consider are actions to be animalistic, or at the very least it'll make it easy for the others to blame anything that goes wrong on us." *Atalantia then looks K in the eyes and waits for a response*

Atalantia then looks towards the party, "As I said before, I think we should hold off on using weapons for now. We must examine the situation and choose our strategy wisely. We would not want to harm the innocent nor endager ourselves."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-09*

Kailyn simply smiles at Atalantia's response. Atalantia doesn't know her plan, which makes sense due to the small fact that she kept it to herself. In response, she grabs Atalantia by the shoulder, moving back to the party and giving a brief rundown of her plan.

"Relax Atalantia." Kailyn states, "My plan isn't to harm, only to have us apprehend them if they have committed the crimes they've been accused of. I have dealt with many types of villains and swindlers over the years, and none have ever gotten past my eyes."

She looks back at the rest of the party. "My plan is to simply lure them, have them come out in fewer numbers and if possible, solve this peacefully. But a group to a criminal is always a problem. If I may, I would like to deal with them alone. Try to listen in and keep stealth as your friend."

"Do we all comply?"

**Bill** - *2017-11-09*

(ooc: Atalania has seen the cliff beyond the shack.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-09*

*Elfriede nods and moves back into the flush area of the forest*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-09*

Afina hesitates, knowing that a pre-emptied strike succeeds more often than one made after the fact. However... her reputation had already taken more than enough blows for one day. She looks at Elfriede, who had already retreated into the forest, and Atalantia, who seemed to acquiesce the plan now that casualties had been minimized. "Agreed." Afina nodded, climbing back into the cover of the forest. "And if... the situation derails. Do we have an attack word?"

**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

(ooc: Nothing happens on my part.)

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-16*

Kailyn waited for Elfriede and Afina to be ready, hiding nearby the cabin as she and Atalantia approached the cabin, finally knocking on the door.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-16*

*Elfriede sighs again as if a huge burden had just been removed from his not-so-broad shoulders*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-16*

Afina crouched in hiding near Elfriede, nervously thumbing the pages on her book. She gingerly opened the book to a strong offense spell, but hesitated seeing her companions knock on the cabin door. Instead, she flipped to a defensive spell, confident that she would be able to help them should the situation become dire.  She turned to watch the confrontation through the foliage.

**Bill** - *2017-11-16*

As soon as Kailyn knocks on the door an almost comical amount of noise comes from the other side. Among them include the sound of a wooden chair being pushed back, bottles rocking back and forth on a table, and coins dropping to the floor. Feet patter around in the room and there's a clipped call of "Uh, just a moment!".

As the noise settles down Kailyn's ears can tell footsteps are moving towards her and the door. The door opens to a young laguz man, with black furred ears and a white tail. His blonde hair rounds out his tabby hair color, mussed slightly. Behind him is a laguz woman around the same age, with white fur and short black hair. She's leaning against a dresser in a rather awkward fashion. Kailyn can see more furniture in the room, a table pushed against the opposite wall with cards and small pile of coins on it as well as a cot by the dresser. Nothing adorns the wall opposite the door. 

The man stands in the doorway, opening the door completely. "Ah, ha..." he sighs a bit. "Sorry for the wait. What... wait can we do for you?" The woman waves with her free hand.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-19*

*Elfriede shifts uncomfortablly in the brush*

*He can almost feel the bugs from the thick brush starting to crawl on him*

*A shiver goes down his spine*

(Ughhh it's going to take forever getting the bugs out of his tail again if they re-nest. He's going to have to scrub for hours...--- Wait! Task at hand!)

*Elfriede glances over at the doorway where the two voices are coming from* 

*Unable to decern whether or not they were friend or foe he'd have to leave it up to K. The boy glances over to Afina in the grass next to him to see what she thinks.*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-11-23*

Atalantia stands next to K at the doorway as planned. Immediately Atalantia notices the two seemingly innocent laguz in the house *"As I thought, these Laguz people may be harmless" Atalantia thinks to herself, but she wasn't ready to let her guard down.*

Atalantia waited a few seconds before she butted in, but her curiosity was killing her as she waited for K to say something. Atalantia had to think of a reasonable explanation as to why they had stopped at these Laguz people's home. 
"Hello there, I am terribly sorry to bug you, but we were passing through this area and we were wondering if you might be able to offer us a place to rest during our travels. We have been traveling for days will little to no rest, and this home seems like the proper location to regain our strength. I'd be willing to repay the both of you if necessary as well" Atalantia eagerly awaits for the response of the two Laguz.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-23*

Afina frowns as she sees the laguz man standing in the doorway. Slowly but surely, the commander’s description of the bandit hideout was coming true. Secluded, small, populated in majority by laguz. The only real question now was what to be done of the bandits. They didn’t seem hostile yet but… with time…

She glanced down at her book once more, anxiously thumbing the pages of the defense light magic tomes. The first sign of trouble and she would begin casting immediately. In the meantime, she had to put faith in the charisma of her company, and hope the situation would be turned to their advantage. She bit her lip, watching the laguz man address the two women. This situation had too much potential to go from bad to worse. Glancing at Elfriede, she noticed his questioning gaze, as if prompting for her thoughts.

“I think our comrades have the situation under control at the moment. I’m nervous, undoubtedly. But this is a… sensitive topic. Laguz are best to deal with a racially-charged laguz matter, yes? So we should be alright,” She forced a smile. “After all, as nobles especially, we have years of basic battle training to help us, just as K and Atalantia have…” Afina caught herself, wondering the best way to phrase her (clearly, fact-checked) assumptions. “They have their years of street smarts garnered from their travels.” She nodded confidently, turning her attention to the conversation arising from the doorway.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-27*

Kailyn knows what she heard. The fall of coin and their awkward stance. They are hiding something, that can be certain.

However their presence is rather friendly at this time for bandits. More of this meets the eye. She awaits their response to Atalantia's request.

**Bill** - *2017-11-27*

"Oh, uh. Do... you mind Anneke? the man says over his shoulder. 

"Not at all. We don't get many house guests out this way, with the whole local bandit tribe thing. We'd be happy to give you a place to sleep." she says. 

"Well, you heard her. Come on in." he says, stepping to the right. "My name is Rudi, by the way..." he says. 

Entering the cabin you can see it's just as scarcely decorated on the near walls as the far ones. There's no more furniture or furnishings, aside from a few more chairs on the near wall, that you saw before. There is however, a pair of muscular tiger Kissaelain that dive from behind the door and grab the two 'guests' from behind as Rudi closes the door. Knives florish to your necks as the beastman make it clear they'd rather you not try to escape. 

"Do... most people knock on the door Rudi?" Anneke asks as she pulls her own knife out. 

"Never. Don't let her draw those blades Archaim. This is strange. Who are you, and what are you doing out here?" Rudi says, walking around to face the two.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-27*

Afina took a deep breath, opening her mouth  to conjure the spell. She froze for a second, remembering that K and Atalantia would have no warning when the blinding light appeared. Biting her lip, she tried to think of some way to warn them. Tapping the glass? Too obvious. Yelling? That would put HER in danger. She needed to cast the spell safely from outside while still giving adequate warning and--

She looked down at the book, at the letters and symbols, thinking how they were the conduit for her magical ability. Each tome had a few copies of each spell. This idea was far-fetched, but it might just work... 

Taking hold of the page, she ripped it out and crumpled it up in her hands. Afina glanced up at the window, and carefully lifted it ever so slightly ajar. She wished luck to herself quickly, before tossing the small paper ball into the middle of the room. 

Afina ducked down, hiding again beneath the window sill, and hurriedly started reciting from her second copy of the spell. Her hand shook as she traced the words with her finger, and her quick recitation was scarcely louder than a hushed whisper. Inside, among the confusion, the small paper ball began to shimmer faintly, as did the book in her hands. Afina heard the muffled noise of a few panicked words exchanged, before the inside of the cabin erupted with a brilliant light. Even without facing the cabin, she could tell from the light that shone through the windows that it's brightness was intense. She hoped her company had recognized the warning and covered their eyes. 

The light abruptly faded as Afina stopped reciting, almost as if a switch had been flipped, and inside she could hear the scuffling and noise inside. She nodded at Elfriede. The other half of the plan was mostly up to him.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-28*

Elfriede let out a loud chuckle at Afina's ridiculous decision, but the fact that it worked was even more ludicrous! Elfriede braced himself and forced the door inward breaking the very frail hinges.

He emerged to a scene of 2 allies be held against their will (albeit loosely now that they were staggered). Elfriede sneered at the 4 present in the room, the two larger tiger ones that were holding onto the allies had to be dealt with first. Kailyn needed to be freed to cast her spells and Atalantia was strong enough to muscle her way out.


*First priority.*


Elfriede lunged to the left, slicing at the knife-holding wrist with his dagger landing a solid hit, then ducking low to stab at the ankle of the large tiger lagu. The dagger fell helplessly to the ground at the same moment the tip of the rapier penetrated the ankle of the foe.

The boy had clearly under-estimated his large opponent. Although injured and clearly blinded, the lagu shoulder checked Elfriede. Hard. He went flying back into the door frame and hit against it flat up against his back. Pain shot up his side and his back as both his tail crunched under the hit and shoulder briefly dislocated causing him to drop his primary sword. He winced through tear beads, but still managed to roll when he touched down and slashed hard at the lagus hamstring with his remaining dagger. 

Elfriede glanced up to K hoping that she had regained herself enough to assist.

Onfroi pushes Kailyn to the ground as Elfreide daggers cuts at his wrist. He steps forward with a loud thump on the floorboards and slams his shoulder into Elfreide. He stalks closer to Elfreide's new prone position and growls as Elfreide's dagger cuts him again. 

"Stay down, Human dog!" he yells and stamps down on the downed Elfreide's head with his boot. Satisfied with the groan, Onfroi kicks the knight's head like a soccer ball and grabs his knife again. He heads for the prone Kailyn and grabs her wrists with one massive hand. He pulls Kailyn back up and interposes her between him and the and the window Afina is couched under. 

---

Archaim twists so his back is to the inner wall of the shack. He holds the knife closer to Atalantia's neck, his other hand wrapped around her waist in an attempt to limit her mobility. 

"Drop those swords on the ground girl, there's no need for you to get hurt." he says over her shoulder. He nods to Rudi and backs up further, making sure Elfreide or whoever was in the window can't get behind him. 

---

Rudi and Anneke both dove for cover when the light went off. They come out from behind the bed as the light fades and take stock of the situation. Rudi points to the window and Anneke nods, the Kissaelain laguz sprinting across the room to the door. Rudi follows behind her, closing the door behind her as she runs outside. Rudi twists and presses his back to the door, taking stock of the now quite injured Elfreide. 

(ooc: The is no dice rolling after this round. Any dice you've acquired will be added to the dice you acquire next round. Think of it as there are multiple posts to the round as a whole. While Rudi and Anneke have names, they are effectively mooks in the scenario. Archaim and Onfroi are able to roll dice to do damage the same as you guys are. The dice you've received this round is posted in the dice channel.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-30*

Elfriede's head started pounding as the heavy boot bore down on his temple. Before he could regain his senses another boot came forward striking him in the cheek. Waves of nausea shot through him and blood trickled down his face as he was sent back. Fighting to stay conscious he watched as the burly tiger man picked up Kailyn easily, even with his wounds.

Elfriede hand slowly found it's way to his sword lying near him on the floor. He glanced up. The man was looking the other way… the fool...
Elfriede stood up fast headbutting as hard as he could into the tiger laguz crotch. 

There was a loud thud as K fell to the floor again.
He felt the distinct animalistic urge to bite him on the neck as he rose. But shook off the feeling with practiced ease.

As the Lagu recoiled from the stinging sensation in his groin Elfriede wrapped his left arm around his throat, gritted his teeth. 

“You are a fool to turn your back on a knight of Eraia.” 

The boy pushed his rapier between the man-beast’s ribs and out the front.

Even then Elfriede felt his consciousness fading..as pain waves pulsed from his crushed tail, his battered head and shoulder this fight had to be ended quickly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-30*

Afina let out a small whoop as she watched Elfriede make a fighting comeback. K would be free to assist now, which would make for a much fairer fight. Elfriede and K had the first tiger laguz under control, so Afina turned her attention to the one holding Atalantia. Popping her knuckles, she triumphantly flipped the pages on her book, landing on a defensive spell that she had been fine tuning for a while. 

She read quickly, fingers tracing the lines of text with ease. Popping up from over the window sill, Afina focused on the second tiger laguz, positioning her magic to defend Atalantia, and, hopefully, make the muscular laguz drop her company member. She smirked, it was ironic that she would be winning Atalantia's favor when the reverse had been the wolf laguz's goal.

Afina focused, and the book began to glow once more, small disks of light and heat radiating from Atalantia's wrists and hip. A slight hiss sounded as the heat seared the laguz's hands, and he cursed (or was it even a growl?) under his breath. Afina squinted, trying to push the magnitude to be hotter and hotter, enough to make the laguz finally release--

From behind, a hand quickly covered her mouth, and Afina gasped as the book fell from her hands. Anneke leaned forward hissing a low "that's enough, don't you think?". The princess shook her head, twisting and struggling against the laguz woman's grip. She kicked her feet, but wasn't close enough to the house to create a noise against the exterior wall. She had to alert her companions somehow, Afina thought, eyes searching for something to make a noise.

An idea struck her, and her hand broke free of the laguz's hold. Afina reached behind her, blindly fumbling, and managed to rip out a chunk of short, black hair from the bandit's head. Anneke growled, shoving Afina roughly against the exterior wall with a thud. Afina gasped as the breath was knocked out of her lungs and a dull pain blossomed along her cheek. She squeezed her eyes shut, hoping her party had noticed the commotion erupting outside.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-12-04*

Being pulled around, shoved and grappled back and forth...Kailyn was enjoying herself too much. She licked her lips as she was tossed prone on the ground, only to be dragged back up.
*sigh*
Nonetheless, this wasn't what was agreed upon, and she must bring up her end of the bargain.

Kailyn begins to morph into her laguz form, struggling to release herself from her breath. The words of "human dog" ring through her ears, giving her a quick idea.
She begins to cry in profuse pain, trying to trick the bandits' souls.

"Is this how you treat your own kind?" Kailyn cried. "I suffered to by the hands of humans, and only seeked shelter. I cry each day and night thinking of the wrongs done to me and my wolf friend. What a world we live in where you can't even trust your fellow laguz!"

As soon as his grip loosens she is going for his throat. Kailyn isn't anyone's bitch.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-04*

Atalantia was slightly disappointed to discover the true nature of these bandits; she truly hoped that these laguz meant no harm and were wrongfully accussed of being malicious bandits. However, Atalantia was still curious at to why these Laguz have chosen the path of a criminal. 
During her tribal days, she witnessed plenty of other tribes try to steal from her own tribe. However, they only did so in order to survive due to the lack of proper training and pack leaders. It was during this quick reflection that Atalantia became blinded by a bright light.
____

Atalantia's eyes become filled with rage in response to Archaim's words. "I refuse to drop my swords on the ground for the likes of you. I suggest that you put your weapons away if you wish not to face my wrath." It was after this statement that Atalantia became alarmed to notice that her arms began to radiate with a light that was relatively dim. The light had a sense of homely warmth to it, similar to that of the camp fires that Atalantia would sleep next to at night. *This must be the doing of Afina Atalantia thought, perhaps she would give me a chance after all.*Without hesitation, Atalantia takes advantage of Archaim's loosened grip and harshly kicks him forward. After this action, Atalantia quickly transform into her wolf form, slides under Archaim's legs, and transforms rapidly back into human form gracefully placing her blades against the Laguz's neck. "The tables have turned now my friend, you best tell the others to surrender" Atalantia nearly yells as if she was prepared to make a battle cry. 

After yelling, Atalantia's ears twitched as she heard a thud from outside. Atalantia became enraged at the concept that more bandits may be waiting near the exterior of the house possibly harming Afina this very moment. Atalantia was torn between two crucial decisions: should she continue to restrain Archaim with her blades, or should she take the gamble and see if Afina needs her assistance. Either way she was most likely screwed.

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

Onfroi grasps at his stomach, doubling over in front of Elfriede. Kailyn's cries ring in his ears but his mind glazes over with a unadulterated rage. His other hand flies forward and grabs Elfriede's left shoulder, throwing all his weight into shoving Elfriede to the floor face first. Onfroi nearly loses his balance doing so, having to step forward before he fell over on Elfriede. 

Onfroi does end up on top of Elfriede, but does so as a massive, brown furred tiger. With paws the size of dinner plates he pins Elfriede to the floor, his forepaws pressing down on Elfriede's shoulders. The growl that follows reverberates through the entire room as his razor sharp teeth approach Elfriede's neck.

---

In the moment Atalantia is distracted by the sound outside Archaim springs, or rather falls, into action. He stops standing, instead falling into Atalantia behind him which sends both of them to the floor. Archaim barely manages to get his forearms up in time to keep Atalantia's flailing sword arms from removing his limbs. They hit the floor with a crash, all of Archaim's significant weight slamming Atalantia against the floor boards. 

Rather than use the chance to make a pin, Archaim rolls off Atalantia and in the following moment he's in his tiger form. He interposes himself between Atalantia and the door, hindquarters primed and ready to pounce. 

---

"You *bitch*!" Anneke shrieks. She grasps at the back of her hair frantically. "That's the problem with you damn humans. You don't think about anyone but *yourselves*!" She grabs her knife off the ground and pulls Afina to ground by her hair. The cat laguz leaps down, straddling Afina and wielding her knife menacingly.

"You know? I think you could use a haircut too!" she growls, her face calm, focused, and clearly eager to do onto Afina as Afina did to her. 

In the room, Rudi nods when Archaim blocks Atalantia from the door. He sprints across the room, going into a slide as he disappeared under the table.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-04*

Afina glares at Anneke, face tight in a scowl. Years of training had prepared her, as a noble, to defend herself against attackers. She knew (in theory, at least) how to disarm an attacking enemy. Chances of success were low when her own knife was pinned between her back and the ground, uncomfortably jutting into her spine in its sheath. As Anneke leaned towards Afina with the knife, Afina took the chance to confuse her enemy. She headbutted the laguz woman hard, and Anneke shrieked, cradling her head. With her limited range of motion, Afina leapt for the fallen book, trying to read from the offensive spell that it had fallen open to. 

Afina read quickly, the first few words escaping her mouth to create a popping and crackling array of sparks. Anneke grunted as the hot flares sizzled in her face, reaching through them to swipe at Afina. The knife landed at the Laeran’s wrist, and Afina winced in pain as the book fell from her hands again, and the sparks fizzled out. Afina cradled her wrist with her free hand, as Anneke prepared to jab once more. 

The laguz lunged, and Afina hit hard and fast into the woman’s wrist with her free hand. The knife fell with a soft thud into the grass as Anneke staggered, the red on the blade glistening in the sunlight. Afina leapt to her feet, taking the opportunity to unsheath her own dagger. The laguz’s eyes went wide for a moment, before shifting into a sinister glare. From her hunched over position, Anneke snarled, appearance shifting to change into her animal form. Afina backed away, searching for a way to counter her attacker.

“Not so useful without your book,” Anneke said calmly, the phrase punctured by growling and bared teeth. 

Afina’s hand shook as it held the knife. Tyndalls didn’t kill. They used diplomacy up until the last possible second before war. She didn’t want to kill this woman, though the other was likely very prepared to kill _her_ if need be. From the corner of her eye, the letters of the open book shimmered in the sunlight. Afina, once again, had a crack shot plan.

As Anneke dove for Afina’s throat, the princess dove to the side, tucking and rolling to grab her book. The heavy, leather-bound spell book felt surprisingly heavy in her hands for the first time since she had started spell-casting. She sheathed the knife, and instead held the book with both hands, scarlet blood cascading down her left arm. Anneke growled once more, and Afina levelled her gaze with the laguz. “I know you do this to survive. So I do not blame you for your actions. But you have hurt too many innocent to walk free. Come quietly, and I promise you will meet fair and reasonable trial at the hands of the Laeran council. The laguz are treated with open arms and open minds in Laera. You don’t have to do this.” 

A sliver of hesitance flickered in Anneke’s eyes, but it was quickly snuffed out by white hot anger seconds later. The laguz lunged, and with a flinch, Afina brought the book down hard on her head. With a whimper, Anneke went limp. Afina stood over her body, book raised once more in a defensive posture. Eyes closed, the woman didn’t stir. With an exhale, she lowered the book, glancing over the cut on her left arm. Afina poked it, and winced as it stung. 
Suddenly, she remembered that her companions were still inside. Afina dashed to the front, book open to a defensive spell, and threw open the front door.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-04*

Elfriede is dazed again as yet another strike to his head lands. Struggling again to hold onto consciousness he remembers that the tiger man had just begun transforming and rolls onto his back. Elfriede recalls his training in dealing with beast form lagu and quickly wraps his deceptively tough cloak around his neck to help stop his attacker’s teeth from gripping and getting a death blow on him.

The lagu in its blind rage then jumped onto the boy pinning him and blasting all the air out of his lungs. Desperately gasping for air Elfriede struggles to cover his neck with his arm. He feels warm liquid running down his side and pooling up around him. He winces thinking himself mortally wounded but something felt off. 

Faun glanced up to the rapier still sticking out of the lagus chest and the beast above him fast losing consciousness. He reaches for his rapier as the heavy lagu collapses on top of him blasting all his air out again. 

Elfriede felt his tail throb with searing heat again under his body as the pain shot up his spine. 

He heard a shriek outside that was clearly Afina. *His charge!*
But, Elfriede hadnt the strength to move the tiger off of him...

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-05*

Atalantia was very disappointed in herself to let Archaim knock her down. Perhaps this is a sign that Atalantia was becoming weaker due to several days of not training. Perhaps once this mission is over, she can train with the others? 

Atalantia then recomposed herself, and kept careful watch on Archaim who was blocking the door to Afina. Atalantia greatly wished to ensure that the princess was safe, however she had an even greater concern in mind.  While keeping an eye on Archaim, Atalantia also directed her attention towards Elfriede who seems to be in critical condition. 
Atalantia has thinks to herself, *"How can you possibly expect to protect Afina, if you can't seem to protect yourself Elfriede. Although to be fair, I suppose the knights may not be used to the Laguz ways of combat. Regardless, Elfriede is one of my teammates; It shall be my duty to protect him along with the others, before it shall be my duty to ensure my own safety alone"*

After her mental debate, Atalantia first directs her attention towards Archaim who is blocking the main door to Afina. At this very moment,  the dire situation of Elfriede grasping for life, and K sobbing on the ground reminds Atalantia of the time in which her two younger siblings where caught off guard by humans who eventually massacred them. 
This flashback enraged Atalantia; she determined that her party was like family, and at this current moment the party appears to be as defenseless as her deceased siblings. Because of this, she would not allow her party to be killed by such pathetic low lifes. 
Through rage, Atalantia lunges towards archaim first starting with a leg sweap so that Archaim falls harshly towards the ground. Next, Atalantia  takes a swing at both of Archaims legs; She focuses her strike on the Peroneal nerve, which is in charge of controlling movement in the lower leg. Such a tactic would be used when hunting large bears during her tribal days, so that they would be weakened and easier to kill.
However, Atalantia refused to kill this laguz, instead seeking a sort of sadistic enjoyment of impairing the Laguz's walking forever. She would not become the same type of low life that killed her siblings.

Once achieving this devastating blow to Archaim's Peroneal nerve, Archaim screams in agony as his legs profusely bleed out.
Atalantia then loudly and bluntly proclaims, "Don't you dare ever take advantage of my family. I gave you all the benefit of the doubt and you did nothing but prove yourself to be mear animals. You aren't Laguz, you ARE Beasts. I cannot allow any of you to represent my kind. None of you deserve to walk out of this location unscathed."

Atalantia then runs to Elfriede's side, with several tears in her eyes. She was not just the tough Laguz wolf everyone assumes she is. 
Atalantia proceeds to push the tiger laguz body off of Elfriede with all her might and anguish. Once this is achieved, Atalantia's motherly instinct goes into play. The sight of Elfriede's managled body reminds her yet again of her massacred siblings, whose limbs were just as mutilated. Blood rushes to Atalantia's face as she begins to rip off pieces of her tunic. After much of her tunic is torn, Atalantia continues to wrap Elfriede's wounds in hopes to stop any critical bleeding. Tears begin to stream down Atalantia's face.

The wooden table suddenly shoots upward, clattering over to one side. More laguz bandits come climbing up a trapdoor that was beneath the table, clearly warned of your intrusion. They branch off to Kailyn on the floor, Atalantia kneeling over the downed Elfriede and Afina in the doorway, each armed and ready for a battle. 

(ooc: They're mooks, so you can write for the lot of them.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-07*

Elfriede world still spinning felt the great weight lifted off of him. He glanced up to Atalantia who was already bandaging his wounds. His wounds… his wounds! 

*Elfriede sits up slowly and is shocked to see him new companion crying over him, she barely knows him. Elfriede gently stops Atalantia from further bandaging him and respectfully looks away from her torn tunic*

*Elfriede smiles* “Thank you, I’m okay... really, please you don't need to bandage my wounds any further, most of this blood isn't even mine. I just have some joint damage and a really bad headache.” 
*He stares at her truly concerned over her sudden emotional state*
“I just might need a shoulder to lean on for our way back.”
*More banging is heard beneath them.*
*He glances over at the trap door opening and grabs his nearby weapons*

*Elfriede slowly stands on weak legs and steadies his weapons as more laguz burst through*

His footwork won’t help him on unsteady legs but these Lagu looked far less trained, Elfriede felt that he could take them even in this state.

*Some of the Lagu rush him and Atalantia. One young cat male coming up for a flank brandishing two sharp knives smiling confidently as he eyed Elfriede in his sorry state*

He dove in one knife cutting low at Faun’s side and one poised for the throat. The Lagu’s look went from confident to shock when he heard metal twice and his arms flew outward. Elfriede’s parries resonated his blades loudly only being silenced as his rapier went through the knee of the Lagu. He would normally kick the boy to knock him off balance and force a surrender, but his balance was way off and he realized he couldn't pull that off. He had to end it. 

Elfriede spun his left hand and reversed the grip driving his dagger begrudgingly into the catboys throat. 

He pulls both blades free as the knives dropped.

“*sigh* One at a time…” He said lethargically. Although he knew that his comanions had this fight well under control. *He snickered a bit to himself.* Except maybe Kailyn. Maybe in her own way.

*the thought was cut short by waves of nausea from his head injuries*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-07*

Afina freezes in the doorway, stupefied by the scene in front of her. Witty and charismatic Kailyn, hunched over on the ground in defeat. Strong and fierce Atalanta, collapsed on the floor in tears. Noble and steadfast Elfriede sprawled on the ground, covered in… blood!? Afina blinked, unsure what to make of the situation. This outcome didn’t line up with her preconceived notions of her company’s fighting ability. She clenched her hand around her book. Tyndalls were very sensitive about their tactician skills; it came from her mother’s side. And to think that Afina had never wanted to come to the bandit hideout to begin with! She clenched her teeth. At least the situation was over with. She could relax knowing they would soon be on their way back to--

Suddenly, the table in the room toppled over, revealing a trapdoor beneath it. The latch swung open, and more bandits poured out from beneath the floor. Elfriede slowly, weakly, got to his feet, as Atalantia wiped her eyes and prepared for combat. Not this _dumb_ feculence again! The annoyances from their travels had been mounting. Losing her authority and respect, disappointing superiors, making the wrong decisions. And now, Afina remembered as blood dribbled down her arm and her cheek radiated pain, _now_ she had been assaulted, only to have to fight more enemies! As a noble, Afina had been taught to keep a level head. Tyndalls used diplomacy up until the last possible second before--

But the princess had reached her limit, flipping to a new page as more laguz bandits rushed her. Afina began to read, one hand holding the book open as another pointed at the bandits. Light began to collect in her palm, bright in comparison to the fast-approaching night time of the world outside of the cabin. Afina was yelling as she read by now, both out of anger and out of desire to be heard over the clanging of metal against metal. As she read the last word to the spell, there was a split second of hesitation as one laguz bandit dared to charge directly at Afina, raising his blade and licking his lips. 

Afina spared but a second to glare at him, before light erupted from her palm, radiating outward in all directions. A flicker of apprehension rippled through her mind, realizing that, this time, she had neglected to warn her companions of the light. But she pressed onwards, hearing the shrieks and groans of the bandits as they were seared by the heat and blinded by the light. Though blinded by anger, a small part of her hoped that her companions felt no such pain. The effects of the spell relied heavily on the caster’s intent. And while she was very much irritated with how events had played out because of them, she would never wish to harm them directly.

The light faded out, revealing a more chaotic scene than there bad been before the light erupted. Afina sighed, more relaxed now that she had taken her frustrations out on her spellcasting, lowering the book in her left hand and unsheathing a dagger with her right. Tyndalls didn’t like resorting to violence, but Afina’s mental fatigue made it difficult to focus on any other high-level spell. The enemies that hadn’t been incapacitated by the spell were to be dealt with swiftly. 

Afina was shocked out of her fatigue as she heard a loud wince from nearby. She turned her head, only to see Elfriede retrieve his dagger from the throat of a bandit. Blood cascading from the wound, and Afina frowned in distaste. She hated violence, but Elfriede was a noble just as she was. He must’ve thought the action absolutely necessary. Afina gasped in surprised as Elfriede hesitated, swaying slightly. She didn’t see where all the blood had come from, but the injury must’ve been severe. She dashed over to him, knowing she would need an ally among all these laguz. She put a hand on his shoulder, “Are you alright?”

**John Bucknam** - *2017-12-11*

Kailyn goes over to Atalantia.

"Hey, you should let them capture me. Let's see where they would take us." Kailyn gives a wink and smile. She refues to acknowledge the last 12 minutes.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-11*

Atalantia recomposes herself relatively fast; Her frustration was subsiding. Atalantia nods in response to Elfriede's gratitude, "I will always be willing to help those I consider to be one of my own"

It's was at this moment that Atalantia heard the sound of a click. The laguz criminals did have something more to hide. Atalantia braced herself to finish of the rest of the criminals with her Allies. 

Atalantia looks over quickly to K who mutters something along of the lines of letting her teammates be taken. Atalantia refuses to fully acknowledge this statement, wanting to even the playing field a bit. 

Atalantia rushes into combat, but shortly after Afina seems to have used some of her light magic, which blinds Atalantia for a moment. During this time Atalantia became atune to her surroundings, she listened and waited carefully in order to avoid any attacks. Once her vision began to clear, Atalantia started to attack the laguz criminals. Similar to the last Laguz she fought, she refused to kill these Laguz in this moment. Instead she began to severe their limbs, specifically the legs, waiting for them to hit the floor crying. Atalantia aimed to inflict more long-standing pain than a short and simple death. 
After slicing the legs of the laguz criminals, Atalantia stood in the center watching all of them fall to the floor crying until they lost enough blood to pass out.

Now it seems like the only thing to do would to be to wait for some reinforcements to handle these criminals. Unless there was more up these bandits sleeves, there should be nothing else to fear.

**Bill** - *2017-12-11*

A guardsman runs out to you as you get close to the garrison. 

"And who might you... Sir Elfriede?!" the guard exclaims, recognizing the knight-lieutenant. The guard looks over Elfriede's wounds quickly and nods in Afina's direction. "Allow me mi'lady." he says, lifting Elfreide carefully and completely. He begins a quick walk back to the station. 

---

Ransford is quickly called as Elfriede is laid down on a cot in the back of the garrison. He looks at Elfriede for mere seconds before calling down the hallway "Narder! Get you and your damn book into the squad room!". He offers Afina a chair before standing against the wall. 

He says nothing until a massive man with enough stubble to sand wood comes in, holding an equally massive tome. Afina can quickly recognize the tome as the standard healing tome in use today by all medics. Ransford nods in the direction of Elfriede and who you can assume to be Narder gets to work on casting. 

Over the spell work of his subordinate Ransford looks between Afina and Elfriede. "You left with two more, and come back injured. I assume you have a story to tell that's quite relevant to me." he says. He motions with a hand that you might as well begin. 

(ooc: Table-2 has been restructured as <@!245270932602486784>  and <@!351785752197201920>. <@!350847001937707022> has moved to table-5, still in the cabin. Where is table 5, Afina and Elfriede might ask? You're unable to read that channel until you link up with Atalantia again. @everyone is to help with keeping the events on table-5 hidden from Afina and Elfriede, to preserve the dramatic tension.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-11*

Elfriede sits still and stares at the floor vacantly as the healer works his magic (literally). He had felt it all before, but it's not something you get used to. The tingling itching feeling as torn muscle fiber moves to reattach itself. Bones being moved back into place. It sent several chills down his spine as his body was healed of his major injuries joints realigned. When it was all done he still was pretty sore in his shoulder and tail but felt several times better. His head wasn't spinning as bad and he felt clearer then he had in the passed few hours.

“Thank you sir. I appreciate it…” He said to the man quietly with numerous vocal influctions akin to embarrassment. 
Elfriede glances over to acknowledge the Guard Captain Ransford and nods ready to explain what happened.

*Elfriede explains what happened with some additions from Afina about her magical prowess*

“I beg you to send a few men out there to round up the downed bandits for trial in the capitol. Also the two Lagu traveling companions stayed behind so the fiends didn't try to escape. Please treat them with utmost respect, as they are Afina’s guests and fought valiantly (he almost chuckled when he said that thinking of K) along side us.” Elfriede says then sighs.

“I’m… sorry to ask so much of you and your men, but could you spare to house us and our returning companions for the night, we could use the rest. I’d ask if you had bathing here but I figure that might have to wait til we return to the mainland.” 

Faun doesn’t show it, but he eagerly awaits the affirmation from the captain. He *REALLY* needs the rest.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-12*

Afina watched as Elfriede seemed to relax instantaneously. The injuries really _had_ taken a toll on his health. As he began to explain their endeavors to the hideout, Afina occasionally chimed in to add more detail. She nodded in agreement with his plea for assistance in bringing the bandits to justice. "Yes, all bandits have been incapacitated, and only need now be tried for their crimes. They should no longer be a nuisance to you, your men, or your constituents," Afina adds. 

Elfriede then sighed, imploring for lodging for the night. Afina couldn't help but shoot him a look of offended surprise from her seat across the room. Sleeping in a _cot_? She understood that they needed the rest, but a cot in a dirty military checkpoint? Without even a BATH? Surely there was an inn nearby. 

Afina turned over her cloak, noting the sanguine splotches spattered across the blue fabric. She then glanced at Elfriede's own wardrobe, seemingly soaked through in red. She shuddered, unable to imagine changing back into bloody clothes the next morning. 

She sighed. Perhaps they would at least give her one of the nicer cots. As Rainsford examined Elfriede, pondering an answer, Afina peered over at the healer's tome book. She had read these before; they never quite made as much sense as the light magic books did, and even _she_ was especially gifted. Maybe Narder would be kind enough to give her a few pointers. She frowned at his large frame and stubbly face. Yes, of course, maybe he was a _nice_ massive, magical medic. 

Still leaning over to examine Narder's healing book, she turned her attention towards the commander. She almost hoped he would deny Elfriede's request. How far could the nearest inn even _be_, she thought. An inn. With a bed. And a BATH.

**Bill** - *2017-12-14*

Ransford says nothing throughout your story, only responding with the occasional grunt or nod of the head. When you finish he crosses his arms, head down in thought. 

"Knight-lieutenant, I'm going to assume you ask for lodgings and rest for your charge and allies, not yourself. It would be terribly unbecoming of a soldier of Lylalel to unload his work onto others." Ransford says without looking at Elfriede. You can imagine the expression on his face with just his tone. 

"We'll need you to show us the way to the shack you mentioned as well. If you incapacitated as many as you say, if they start waking up while we're searching for it in the dark your allies might be in serious trouble. Narder will have you cleaned up in a jiffy, he does great work." he says to the Eraian knight-lieutenant. He then turns to Afina.

"I have no right to suggest anything to you mi'lady, but if I might. I will need almost every man at this garrison doing something, either maintaining a skeleton crew here at the station or assisting in this unexpected need for a raid. I have no men I can give you for your protection. I need sir Faun's guidence as well. My suggestion would be to return to the shack with the larger group. I will do whatever I can to suit your own plans, however." he gives a short bow for politeness's sake. 

"I have men to gather. We'll be leaving within the half hour Knight-lieutenant." he says and turns on a heel out the door. As if by his bidding, the door slowly closes behind him with a soft click. Narder drops his hand from his salute. he says "Be just a few more minutes sir." and returns to spellcrafting.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-14*

As soon as the door shut Elfriede let out a defeated sigh. Elfriede seemed extremely childish in that moment, crossing his arms after being scolded and huffing. After remember that he wasn’t alone he quickly regained himself. He glances over to Narder hard at work, sighs and takes a seat on the bench a few feet behind him. He was *really* tired… After all that travelling today, then a fight in which he sustained injuries, THEN travelling back here. He crossed his arms and huffed again, then briefly glanced up at Afina. Hopefully she wasn’t looking at him in this sorry grumpy state… but he knew she was. He was the only one she knew all that well here. *Unless* she was just so in awe by the spectacular image of Narder. 
    “I guess we’ll just wait for Narder to clean us up then we’ll get ready to head back out.” Elfriede grumbled half to himself.
    With heavy eyes Faun was thinking about the detour to the Laguz cabin. Ugh… we could have been almost at the capitol by now. He rested his head on the wall behind him and as if an extremely delayed reaction Elfriede felt the extreme soreness caused by sitting back. He winced a bit at the dull pain coming from his lower back region and suddenly sat forward to take the pressure off his tail.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Immediately, Narder pointed to a drain in the floor, and then gestured over to a bucket on the wall. Afina nodded slowly, hesitantly. Surely Narder didn’t mean to just dump the bucket on their heads. Narder lifted the bucket, gesturing for Elfriede to step up first. Oh, Narder _did_. 

Elfriede sighed, accepting the cost of removing so much grime. Afina giggled, how rudimentary of the military to wash in such a way. Though, with the state of things, she wasn’t quite surprised. She watched as the water mingled with the red dye of the blood, and swirled around the drain. Judging from Elfriede’s distasteful reaction, there wasn’t much warm water in the outpost. 

As Narder lifted a second bucket to dump, Afina flipped open her spell book, and a small sphere of bright heat appeared in the bucket with a sizzle. Narder hesitated to look down at it, before shrugging and dumping it on Elfriede once more. A much more pleasant experience, Afina nodded. 

Narder moved towards her with Afina with the bucket, but she hold up a hand to stop him. Instead, she untied her cape and handed it to him to wash. After, they would be staying at an inn later to truly wash off; For now, she just needed the blood washed away. Narder nodded, dunking and swirling the bundle of blue fabric. Once he was finished, Afina laid it out on the bench, next to where Elfriede sat, drenched. She whispered a spell from her tomes once more, and a large ball of heat filled the room. 

Afina watched as steam wafted from the damp clothing, disappearing into the air. Staying at the inn would be the most uneventful thing she had done in 24 hours. Since leaving Theanovene, she had gotten into many arguments, helped to take down a bandit base, and started making remarkable headway towards actually befriending others. She smiled to herself. Not bad, Afina.

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

It is a quick half hour and you find yourselves heading out of the garrison. As you step out you can say a sizable amount of men grouped up, more than you'd seen in the garrison before. Ransford is their front, barking orders which are immediately preformed. There's no hesitation in the men, Ransford says jump and they jump as high as they can. Many of the men carry lanterns which light the area, while there is a decent amount of moonlight tonight there are also quite a few clouds to block it.

"Faun!" Ransford shouts. He motions for the two of you to come to the front. As you do, you can see three horses at the front as well.

"Each of you can take a horse, or if the lady prefers you might ride together." he says, still waving one of his men onto a new task. "You'll guide the way, once we're at the cabin we'll debrief quickly and the two of you can stay back, Faun to protect your charge and Mi'lady Tyndall as it's not your role to be a combatant here." he continues, mounting his own horse. He finally looks your way. Ransford nods at you once, making eye contact with each of you in turn. The man seems incredibly at home in front of a squadron of men.

"Alright, we're moving out!" he calls and looks at the two of you expectantly to start leading.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-19*

Afina looked up at the horses. Sharing a horse? How antiquated. Elfriede looked at her, head cocked, indicating that the decision was clearly up to her. Afina pursed her lips and walked forward, positioning one foot in the stirrup to hoist herself up onto the saddle. She struggled, and a few soldiers stepped forward to assist her, but she briskly shooed them aside. Every noble knew how to ride, of course. But that didn't mean it was easy. 

Finally, she hoisted herself up, adjusting her tunic and taking out one of her tome book from her pack. She positioned it between her lap and the saddle. Ransford said she was a non-combatant, huh? She'd show him. Behind her back, Ransford began barking orders once more, and she rolled her eyes at him. 

When he finished, Ransford got their attention, and locked eyes with both the nobles in turn, before his gaze softened. Oh! He expected them to lead. Finally. Afina comfortably adjusted to the new, proper position. She nodded at Elfriede, and then began to read from the tome. This would teach Ransford to question her ability.

Ahead on the path, up in the air, a white ball of light shown, bobbing and wavering in the darkness. Eraian soldiers were accustomed to light magic by then, but that didn't mean that it was necessarily the most common thing to see. Many stopped mid-conversation and stared, the brilliant light shining on all the lines and scars on their faces. Afina heard a quick whoop from one soldier and smiled to herself, continuing to read from the book to shine the way. THAT would show them.

She paused a moment to nod at Elfriede, gesturing that he direct the now-attentive crowd with a few words.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-19*

Elfriede nodded to Afina and turn to face the crowd, glancing at Ransford to make sure he had permission to lead. 

    Elfriede straightens and speaks in a practiced militarized voice, “We’ll lead you to the shack. I'm sure you've been briefed but the Lagu there are all incapacitated. I don't expect it to take us very long. An hour or two at most. We shouldn't meet any resistance, unless this one shack was part of a larger group. That’s all, lets move out. Lady Afina will light the way.”

    Faun mounts his horse and trots up to the lead with Afina while motioning Ransford to follow with his men that had assembled. 

    “Once we get there and get this mess cleaned up we should be able to head out toward the main land in search of *somewhere* to rest thats fitting. Although we may have to get comfortable with the fact that we might have to camp. Although I am quite sure that the idea did not escape you. Even nobles have to camp from time to time.” 

    Elfriede took the moment to think about the events of the day, the trials, the arguing. He felt every fiber of his being was tired. He had been through more in the last day then his military training put him through on a regular basis. (At least since he ranked up to be important enough, the younger ranks and boot camp were rough) He found himself thinking about a luxurious inn to rest at with fine furnishing and a huge bath. There was one he had stayed at in his youth during a short family getaway when his father was on business with the military. He didn't appreciate it as much as a preteen boy... but now. 

    “Ah.. It’ll just make that bath when I finally get it all the sweeter.” He glanced over to Afina filled with sudden energy. “I think I’m going to have to splurge when we get back to Eraia. I have some more time left of my leave and my family is allowing me a few days to spend it how I wish.”

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

Ransford only nods at Elfriede's warning they were about to approach the cabin. He takes the lead from the young knight and draws his blade. The rest of the men fall silent and a energy follows over the group. They're ready for a fight. Once the cabin is in sight, Ransford dismounts and motions for the two of you to stay off to the side as agreed. 

Ransford and his troops move up quickly to the door, Ransford at the door itself. He makes a hand sign and the troops brace themselves before Ransford pulls open the door and they filter inside. You can see activity inside the cabin for a frantic moment before the excitement seems to die down. A few moments more and Ransford comes out of the cabin. He's marching towards you two.

"Faun!" he barks as he gets close. He sounds terribly frustrated. "There was only a single man inside. You had left your wolf ally here correct? Is this not the right place?" he asks. While he is clearly annoyed that things aren't like he was briefed, his asking after Atalantia sounds different, a bit closer to concern. He motions to walk and talk as you join the rest at the cabin.

Inside half a dozen men mill about inspecting the room. Three hold a sole laguz bandit whose in the process of being bound and gagged. A last man has flipped over the coffee table and is looking down the trapdoor you saw when you were first here.

"Sir!" the soldier calls. "You'll want to see this." Ransford jogs over and looks down the trapdoor. He gives a quick order to the man who runs out of the building before turning back to the two of you.

"Were you aware there's more to this complex?" he growls. "That's no hideaway, it's a tunnel leading deeper into who knows where. Did you even clear the room before you left your ally here alone?" The man he sent out comes back in. 

"The bandits have built structures lining the entire cliffside down. That tunnel must serve as the entrance!" he reports. 

"Damnitall, this isn't a tie them up and march them back situation. We've just stepped into their HQ with half the men I'd like to do it!" he shouts. He looks to the two of you before clicking his tongue with an audable *tsk*. "Everyone in. We'll need to clear the place ourselves since our prior intel is useless." The men start scrambling about getting ready.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-21*

He stared back to the captain wide-eyed as his heart skipped a beat and he struggled to find breath.

“W-what do you mean noone is there?”

Elfriede hastily dismounted his steed and rushed over to Ransford. He assumed the only body in the cabin was the unfortunate Lagu boy that had assaulted him earlier which he shook his head at. He didn’t want to think about that too much. He glanced around desperately looking for some clue, some verification of where they went. 

“Ransford? They are all gone? Atalantia she--” Elfriede’s voice quivered and he bit his tongue hard. He felt like a complete fool. He promised Atalantia that he’d be back, he promised her that she’d be okay… but something didnt add up. Atalantia wouldn’t have gone dont without a fight. There must be some clue of a scuffle or of a capture. Elfriede glaced around looking for clues again, some trail. He tried to stop his mind from wandering to the place where Atalantia betrayed them. She fought with them with honor. She wouldn't be so quick to betray Afina, her kingdom, her dream was at stake. He gnashed his teeth together and realized his tongue was bleeding slightly from his sharper than normal canine teeth.

He stared at Ransford. “This is not at all how we left this scene. Some of the Lagu bandits were close to mortally wounded! They couldn’t have just GOT UP and walked away!” He realized he was yelling and calmed himself a bit. Is there anything that would point to where they went, where Atalantia is?” He spun to look at the still mounted Afina wide eyed.

(Soldier informs everyone of the complex)

“I...we...I was injured and...I’m sorry there’s no excuse, We should have searched more before coming back.” Elfriede did breathe a sigh of relief that Atalantia didn't betray them,but then quickly felt uneasy all over again as Atalantia was still nowhere to be found.

“Lady Afina… I’m sorry, but I guess this trip is going to be delayed further…” he said defeated.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

As Elfriede leapt from his horse, Afina was still working through her emotions. There were two possibilities: that Atalantia was captured, or that she had defected. And if it was the prior, this whole cabin would have been wrecked in the process. Face still struck with astonishment, she watched as Elfriede paced around, yelling some things at Ransford, who looked similarly as concerned. Odd, Afina thought. She had gotten the impression that Ransford didn't necessarily care about their traveling company, much less a rogue laguz.

Afina dismounted and wandered into the cabin behind the other soldiers. The blood from their original combat was still there, but no other signs of struggle could be seen. Afina knelt down and touched the ground, even using her spell to illuminate the scuffled floor. Distantly, she could hear Ransford lecturing them (mostly Elfriede), but she was more concerned with finding the truth. 

"Everyone in," Ransford commands, and she stands up straight. No signs of struggle. Zero. And entering enemy territory with half as many men as they should have? Any Tyndall tactician would advise against such a strategy. Elfriede starts to apologize, and she quickly cuts him off. "Can I speak with you before we enter enemy territory once more, Elfriede?" She says, nodding towards the door, the tone in her voice making the question seem more like a hesitant command. The slight shake to Afina's voice indicated just as much.

**Bill** - *2017-12-26*

Ransford's boot hit the floor behind you with a creak. "Alright boys, we have a building to clear. Two men to a doorway, clear the room and mark the door. Don't split too far from the group." he calls. The men ahead begin a coordinated advance. They head down the hallway in two columns. When they approach a doorway the first two flank the door and push it in. The two rotate in together, swords raised. When they clear it the slash the floorboard and reenter the columns. If it's occupied the two fall behind to subdue the man inside. 

Ransford speaks over Elfriede and Afina's shoulders. "Don't worry about clearing. We're waiting for when something happens. Keep those eyes peeled." Things go on like this for what feels like a million doors. You can feel the floors slope further and further down the side of the cliff. 

The number of men dwindles, with only half a dozen in front of the three of you as you enter a large room filled with crates and barrels. In the center of the the room is a hexagon shaped section of the floor that is mounted to a pulley system with large chains on each of the corners of the hex. Quite a few bandits hunkered down in this room, using the boxes and barrels for cover as they fire arrows across the room into the shields of the front line men. Over half a dozen more dash out with scimitars and axes to enter melee combat.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-26*

As the arrows thudded into the leather shields and clanged off of the metallic ones Elfriede readied himself with his usual. In his right hand a long, double bearded yet skinny rapier and in his left hand a small defensive dagger with wrist guards designed specifically for catching blades and turning them aside. He glanced to Afina then Ransford and nodded to each as if to confirm what they all understood: this would most likely be one of the hardest fights of the night with the dwindling soldier reserves.

The laguz advanced, Elfriede, agile despite recent events, dashed right and low around the ally soldiers and emerged in front of an engaging muscular laguz female who was already bringing down a sharp two handed Flamberge. More often than not bandits with unwieldy weapons use them for appearance more than actually usefulness. They were unwieldy. Elfriede reversed the grip on his dagger and brought it shoulder height at an angle downward and met the heavy sword, throwing its weight outward to the left of Elfriede and straight down into the floor splintering the wood floor and knocking up the shale underneath.
Elfriede brought his rapier down directly through the left knee of the tiger-featured woman, then his armoured shin came around back and kicked fiercely into the back of the leg, crumpling any balance the bandit might have had. She howled at the suddenly seering sensation from her leg. During all this, Elfriede withdrew his sword from the leg and did a backward rotation. As the laguz came down on their back, Elfriede brought his left boot straight out in a side kick and connected directly with the woman’s jaw. One last glance and Elfriede saw the whites of her eyes as they rolled back from the impact.

**“Don’t get up.”**

Faun desperately wanted to glance back to see Afina reaction to the practiced routine and maybe gloat a bit, but wasn’t the time. There were plenty more where that came from.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-26*

Afina’s heart had been beating hard ever since they descended the trapdoor. Long gone was the bravado from just a few minutes before, as the reality of the situation sunk in. They were in the center of a laguz stronghold. This wasn’t going to be an easy fight, and Afina knew it. She had talked a big fight in front of Elfriede, and _especially_ Ransford, but standing in the dim atrium, surrounded by fighting soldiers, she wasn’t quite sure.

As the first laguz emerged for a battle, Afina found herself frozen in fear. This was many more laguz than she had ever seen in a _peaceful_ setting, much less a violent one. Her reading hand shook, and her boots felt is if they were stuck to the floor. Come on, Afina, you look ridiculous now, she thought. Only an idiot leads men through the forest with the confidence of a thousand commanders, only to cower in fear when the blood starts spilling. Tyndalls pursued peace until the last possible second, but these bandits didn’t seem to take that option into account. 

When the fighting had started, Elfriede immediately jumped into action. Of course, he had been radiating energy since their conversation outside, and it hadn’t seemed to dwindle in their course through the stronghold. Not even Ransford’s reprimanding had depressed his mood. A small smirk snuck onto Afina’s face as she remembered his challenge of authority. "I won't be caught so off guard this time... Afina", he had said, dropping the quintessential title designated for her social rank. What a little--, Afina thought, suddenly distracted as Elfriede withdrew his sword from a laguz woman’s leg and kicked her squarely in the jaw. Afina cocked her head as she watched him taunt the incapacitated laguz. Huh, she thought. She had to admit to being a little impressed. Not that that gave him the right to call her “Afina” just yet.

To her other side, Ransford fought, with less agility and more power than Elfriede. Even the dim lights of the atrium gave his salt and pepper hair a distinct sheen, though he hardly broke a sweat. Or… was he? Something stirred in the old man’s face that wasn’t the familiar hardness of a commanding officer. Was he worried? Or was he _enjoying_ himself? Afina couldn’t stand to see even the elderly guy beating her in combat. She was a princess, but certainly not a damsel in distress. 

Afina had burned through a lot of pages in their travels today, but nonetheless she still had some tricks up her sleeves. She had done the ball of light, the disks of light heat, the shower of sparks… finally, she landed on the page she wanted. Afina’s hand shook, and she flexed it, forcing her nervous body to obey her mind. She began to read, one hand holding the book and the other outstretched before her, eyeing a laguz target near Elfriede. If he was going to show off, so would she.

Fixated on the bandit, Afina conjured a circle of light around him on the floor. The lumbering laguz froze upon seeing the bright halo, squinting to inspect the magic circle for but a moment. In one swift motion, Afina’s free hand raised into the air, and the circle on the ground turned into a tube, the walls of which confirmed the laguz man inside. She could vaguely hear confused yelling, and yelps of pain as the man dared press a hand to the barriers of light. His hands seared with pain at the touch of the light, and he wiggled to avoid the surface of the tube. Every few seconds, the light would flicker, but then return with the same brilliant intensity. With concentrated focus, Afina closed her fist, and the tube coalesced into a single beam of light that shot up from the ground. The laguz man trapped inside wailed, his sword clattering to the floor with a metallic crash. Finally, Afina released the spell and the light abruptly faded, revealing a trembling bandit on his hands and knees, just as a garrison soldier went for the final blow to the head.

Afina exhaled shakily, relaxing her posture. She hadn’t quite perfected the spell, but that effort had been her best yet. And if her timing had been correct, and Elfriede wasn’t dumb and blind, then he must’ve seen the very same feat. The corner of Afina’s mouth cracked into a small smile. That’ll teach you to drop the “lady” title, she thought. Her reverie was cut short as another laguz, noting the damage she had caused to his companion, began to charge. Afina inhaled quickly, standing straight, palm facing out and hurriedly reading from her book. Sparks shot forward from her hand, catching on the bandits body and scorching through his clothes, but it did little to slow his quickening approach. Afina panicked, dropping her book and hurriedly unsheathing her dagger. She only knew how to counter with this weapon, so she would have to wait for a soldier to take over the duty of attacking.

**Bill** - *2017-12-28*

"Use the cover yourself you daft fools, a shield can't protect you forever!" Ransford barks. His own weapons are drawn, a large shield and an equally large sword. The blade is large for a one handed sort and nicked heavily; it's clearly custom made for the Commander. His troops follow his orders, half of them going for cover themselves and drawing bows from their backs. As the bowmen begin to trade arrows back and forth Ransford and the other half of his soldiers step into the fray.

Ransford steps up to a tiger laguz wielding a longsword with two hands. The Commander marches straight up to the laguz and rather than swing his blade he swipes his shield forward and out, forcing the tiger's sword up and away from him. Ransford then does a cross body slash that cuts across the laguz's legs. A cat laguz jumps at him from the side with two daggers. Ransford steps backwards with one foot, sinking into a lunge with his shield forward. The kneeling posture lets his shield cover more of his body and the daggers click uselessly against the worn metal. 

Ransford steps to his full height as the cat takes a leap backwards. Ransford steps forward this time slashing wide and just barely missing the bandit. His shield arm goes up again, blocking a swing from the tiger he slashed earlier. Ransford pivots to face the tiger, parrying another swing of the longsword before kicking the man's injured thighs. The tiger laguz falls to his knees and Ransford thrusts his blade into his shoulder. The man falls prone, and his sword clatters against the wood floor, not before Ransford pivoted back to the cat laguz with the daggers.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-28*

Faun had never seen anything quite like that spell, even during his time among the clergy caster branch of the military, which wasn’t too surprising. A lot of solo light mage’s spells that are not among the clergy are unique; the clergy is a place of practice and ritual but as a result a lot of the spells are rather similar. Afina’s spell was unique to her, you can feel that she poured herself into it. Elfriede was rather impressed by the display.

Just then, he watched as a bandit broke ranks to charge Afina. The boy winced as she withdrew her dagger from its sheath, hoping silently to Lylalel that she knew how to use that thing.
In the barrage of arrows that followed, Faun watched as several of the bandits in the rooms were shot, downing many, some fatal. 

He took careful note of Ransfords current movements and position. His title was rightly earned, but Faun couldn't help but think that if he wasn’t so gruff he would have made it so much further. Overall the situation was well in hand. These untrained bandits were being decimated by these trained soldiers and Afina’s casting.

Just then, a dual short sword wielding young man wearing a fur tunic jumped out of the shadows to engage Elfriede. He came at him with a false vertical slash and deftly switched to a dual low stab. Elfriede couldn’t believe the boys speed he barely saw him switch. As if instincts alone were guiding Elfriede, he back-stepped and double slash-parried downward knocking the boys swords down just out of reach. Cold sweat began to gather; that was *way* too close.

This boy was clearly going to take some time to bring down, but it was time Elfriede didn’t have. He was currently transfixed on the Lagu engaging Afina in melee. He wanted to reposition to defend Afina. Elfriede thought that the soldier’s wall would be enough to keep them away from her. Trying to stop his mind from wandering to the dark place wear Afina is brought down after all that has happened today, he knew that he couldn’t just disengage this one.

Slowly, he moved his dagger hand behind his back, pointed the rapier toward his target and turned his body sideways in typical duelist fashion. Faun slowed his breath as he was taught and readied himself for his counter-heavy fighting style. The laguz rushed him with a spinning slash with both weapons. Elfriede’s sword came across knocking one aside and then pivoted, bringing his dagger around to clash against the other. With a twist Elfriede threw one of the boys swords sliding across the floor. Elfriede then went low, wrapped his arm arm the boys free arm and shoulder threw the him across the room toward the bandit engaging Afina, landing short into some barrels. Elfriede swiftly rushed him giving almost no recovery time and went on the offensive, prodding the boy for an opening with his rapier. Combinations of slashing and thrusting attacks were knocked aside by the combatant. Elfriede kept pushing him back until they began to near where Afina was being engaged. *Elfriede felt he had to do something soon.* He didn't trust that Afina would last long in melee combat, he feared for her.
A flash of light went off and he suddenly pivoted in the middle of his string of attacks and kicked the laguz hard up and over a crate. during that brief moment he looked over to Afina who was looking up at him and he winced at the blood smeared across her face. A moment later the bandit was back up now holding a long sword in his off-hand that he retrieved from another fallen soldier.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-28*

Knife against knife, it was clear the laguz boy had not been formally trained in knife fighting. He jabbed at awkward angles, attacking more out of determined anger than practiced strategy. Afina blocked each swing; she hit his forearm here, jabbed his elbow there. And still the laguz male attacked with vicious prejudice, teeth barred in anger. He jabbed forward, slashing at Afina’s chest, and her knife met his with a metallic clang. The force shook Afina’s grip, but she held on tight, her bright blue eyes meeting the wild brown ones of her attacker. Out of her peripheral vision, Afina saw Elfriede engage in combat with a dual-wielding bandit, and she made a quick mental note of where he was positioned.

In her moment of hesitation, the bandit landed a swift kick to Afina’s torso, knocking the air out of her lungs. She doubled over with a gasp, and the bandit swung at her once more. Afina reacted quickly, dropping to her knees and slashing at the bandit’s legs. The knife made contact, but only just barely, ripping the thigh fabric of his pants and drawing blood. Afina herself was surprised that she had managed to land a hit, eyebrows raised in shock.

The bandit made a noise somewhere between a growl and yell, dropping his weapon to grab Afina by the back of her hair, and bringing his knee into her face hard. Pain splintered through Afina’s nose, and she held her face in agony, her hand coming back coated in bright red. The bandit released her to retrieve his weapon, and in a daze, Afina shakily got back to her feet. Afina held out her dagger with one hand, as the other hand attempted to stifle the blood flowing from her nose, the scarlet red now cascading down her arm. She glanced at Elfriede, still engaged with his combatant, closer now. 

This time, the dagger didn’t shake as Afina held it firmly in her hands. Tyndalls didn’t kill, that much was still true. But the animalistic behavior that she had witnessed in her attacker infuriated her. This was his last chance. “This is your final chance at repentance, come peacefully, and you will treated with fairness in the eyes of the law,” Afina said firmly, still stemming her nosebleed. The bandit boy chuckled in response, his voice surprisingly young. How old was he, she thought. “You think I would surrender to the likes of _you_? When I have the advantage?” he shook his head. “You’re dumber than you look.”

Afina’s eyes flashed with anger. Dumb? _DUMB_? “Very well then, attack me if you dare, you filthy beast,” she declared, glaring. The laguz lunged, seemingly transforming in mid-air. Afina evaded to the side, diving for her book that had landed with pages open on the floor. She exhaled in relief as she felt the crinkled pages meet her finger tips. 

The tiger that had been a man mere seconds before turned to face Afina, snarling, and immediately his body was consumed in a bright, white light. Laying across the floor, Afina had projected a single beam of light, flowing from her outstretched palm. The force of the blast sent air whistling through the small atrium, whipping Afina’s blonde hair into her face, the light locks stained red with the blood smeared across her cheek. The laguz howled and whimpered in pain, only the black outline of his tiger form visible as he writhed in the white beam. 

Afina closed her first, and the beam faded, revealing the wolf laguz collapsed on the floor. She sighed in relief. Climbing back to her feet, she suddenly locked eyes with Elfriede across the room, whose face conveyed a mix of concern and surprise. “I’m alright,” Afina called, wiping away the last of the blood from her nose with a small smile. The streaks of drying blood on her cheek and arm were a _clear_ indicator to Elfriede that she could handle herself, Afina thought sarcastically. But at least she had pulled off yet _another_ advanced light magic spell. She had been sent from home to 'become learned'; Maybe this was it. Afina rolled her shoulders, readying herself for more combatants with an exhale.

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

Ransford blocks another pair of thrusts from the cat laguz's daggers. The cat can't seem to break the Commander's guard no matter how much the kissaelain woman exhausts herself. The Commander watches her carefully, waiting for an overextension due to the constant attacking. 

Ransford crouches and rotates his shield arm, allowing him to get the shield underneath the woman's arms. He forces them up with a push of the shield, using his legs to power the shield up. The woman's arms fly straight up and she drops her daggers. She turns quickly and attempts to put space between herself and the Commander but he grabs her by the back of her shirt. With a swift thunk he knocks the woman out with the pommel of his sword. He says something quietly as he lays the woman down gently, though no one was close enough to hear.

Ransford stands tall again, effectively in the middle of the no man's land between the lines of archers. He raises his shield to deflect an arrow and surveys the battlefield from that dangerous position. He looks over to Elfriede and Afina, particularly with the bloodied princess. He gives her a slow nod of acknowledgement before turning back to the line of enemy archers.

Ransford marches forward to one of the last groups of archers. two are brave enough to take a pot shot over the massive crate that stands between the Commander and them, though the arrows bounce off of Ransford's heavy shield. The man growls as he marches up to the crate. With a mighty swing of his blade he cleaves the crate in two, causing grain to pour out of the box. The archers scramble back, but each one is beaned in the head by the Commander's shield before they can get anywhere. Statisfied the archers are out of commission, Ransford turns around to see the rest of the brawl wrap up.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-02*

Elfriede broke gaze from the princess and rushed the young bandit once more, eyeing Ransford again from the corner of his eye as the hardy man took down more bandits. The young Laguz smirked deviously, dropped low and went for another feint double stab low as he had done before. “This must work against untrained fools a lot for him to try it twice.”, thought Elfriede with condescension. He brought his blades low again to parry when the boy suddenly pivoted, dropped his weapons, stood on his hands and kicked upward toward Faun’s chin. At the last possible moment the duelist swayed backwards, swords in the same position, and brought them both slashing outward cutting a deep gash with the razor sharp edge of his rapier in the boy’s arm.

At the same moment the boys foot collided with Elfriede’s face, not nearly as hard as he had been hit earlier in the day, but hard enough. Elfriede stumbled a few steps backwards as red ran freely from one nostril. Although annoyed, he wasn’t able to hold that visage for long as he saw the boy fall holding his bleeding arm he had just collapsed onto. Elfriede spat on the ground and sheathed his swords, thinking the battle won. He glanced once more to Ransford, and went to turn around to make sure Afina was alright. His keen ears suddenly heard frantic scuffling of feet behind him. All the hairs on his body stood up in the moment; Faun knew that he didn't have time to turn around to stop what was going to happen.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-02*

Afina continued to wipe her face, trying to remove the blood that had started coagulating on her cheek. She glanced around the room at the remains of the battle. Ransford had defeated the archers, the soldiers had disposed of most of the bandits, and Elfriede was quickly going to overwhelm his opponent. Now would be the time for reconnaissance. 

Afina knelt down towards an incapacitated bandit, light beam spell at the ready. “Tell me where Atalantia is!” she demanded, her glowing palm in the cat laguz’s face. The dazed bandit continued to stare blankly at the ceiling. “Tell me!” Afina yelled, the light in her palm glowing brighter. The princess frowned at the lack of a response, standing up straight to find another target. She leaned over another fallen opponent, light magic at the ready. “Take me to Atalantia the wolf laguz!” The man didn’t stir. In hindsight, she should have taken a hostage earlier in the fight, if the tiger bandit had not given her so much trouble. 

Across the room, Afina heard a low grunt, and turned to see Elfriede stuck in the face by a bandit’s foot. Blood began to flow from his nose, and Afina had to chuckle a little at the irony. Both of them had remained relatively injury-free, save for a nosebleed. The bandit boy collapsed, red blossoming on his shirt from an arm injury, and Elfriede turned to Afina confidently.

The laguz bandit jumped to his feet, and Elfriede began to spin around. Afina gasped. The knight lieutenant had sheathed his sword, and wouldn’t have enough time to parry. Thinking quickly, she flipped open her book and extended her hand. A beam of light shot from Afina’s palm, brighter and warmer than when she had cast it before, wind whistling through the room with the power of the blast once more. The spell passed through Elfriede and his opponent instantaneously, with drastically different effects on both men. Homely warmth swirled around Elfriede, comparable to that of a fireplace at night. His attacker, conversely, dropped his weapons, collapsing to his knees with a yell. 

The light cleared, and Afina sighed in relief. Elfriede remained completely unharmed, whilst his opponent cowered on the floor, defenseless. The knight was blinking back his ability to see again, and Afina quickly shook off her fear, replacing it with confidence. She had had the situation under control from the beginning. Of course. She walked towards Elfriede, whose face showed a mix of confusion and surprise. “An awfully close fight, knight lieutenant,” she said playfully, the slightest twinge of fear still laced through her voice.

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Ransford gives a last few orders to his men and nods with his head in the direction the exit of the room. He leads the way, sword and shield still drawn and at the ready. He, unlike his men, ignores a few doors and heads straight for the end of the hall, stopping at a large pair of double doors. 

"This looks promising." he mutters. He looks to each of you, nods, then pushes the door open with his shield in front of him.

(ooc: returning from table-5)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

Elfriede sat back down on the bed and pondered over the fight again. They had to become stronger if Rica was able to do what she did to them. Training together sounded like a good idea. Atalantia was strong and Afina brilliant. Himself swift and cunning but if they didnt learn how to work together...

---

The knight lieutenant left briefly to secure hand washing materials that they usually have on hand in these barracks and a bucket of water. He sat at the end of the low bed, removed his shirt and began grating it against the board in the water. He wanted it clean before attempting any repairs on it, secretly hoping one of his companions was proficient in sewing.

He glanced over to his companions. “I’ll wash whatever you two need, just throw it in the water. Sorry in advance, I probably won't be able to get it all out, but it’ll have to do for now.”

Elfriede freezes in place as it finally hits him. He was so caught up in the moment he hadn't realized. *Someone knows...*. *Someone* had undressed him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Afina used a bathroom to freshen up and change into another outfit. Being a regal dress, with little to no functionality, she tried to wear it only when lounging around Tyndall Tower. Now, however, with her travelling clothes in a state of disrepair, this was her only option. The princess strode through the halls of the outpost with her shoulders back and head held high, a spell book tucked underneath her arm. Among the gritty and tough soldiers, Afina seemed very out of place. The fabric of her long, blue dress fluttering as she walked, standing in stark contrast to the ranks of armor-clad men that patrolled the station. But such a fact had no bearing on Afina. Filled with energy and competitive spirit, Afina was determined to master her magic. 

---

---

As Elfriede sat down to wash their clothes, Afina was finishing a letter to her father in Callora. She wrote hesitantly, thoughtfully, pouring over every word as she scrawled it on the paper. 

```
Dearest Father, 
I hope this letter finds you well. By now, word must have reached you that I am travelling to Eraia to study abroad. Master Witella was able to secure passage and paperwork to travel to Trisp, and while I am not formally studying among other light mages, I hope that the cultural immersion will assist me in my pursuit of knowledge. How does Laera find itself now? Is the King’s Council serving you well?
```

``` 
Though we have only been travelling but a day’s time, my escorting party has already engaged in a skirmish with violent laguz near an Eraian military outpost. We fought valiantly, and I am proud to say we brought many laguz to rightful justice as a result. I would like to think that every laguz captured today brings us one step closer to righting the wrongdoings done to our people.

The travelling party is light, but formidable. I am escorted to Trisp by an Eraian knight, Elfriede Faun, and a Wynne laguz-noble, Atalantia Enneka. 

Elfriede is a skilled swordsman with a rapier, with a very admirable dedication to honor and duty. I trust him to carry out his current order of escorting our party to Trisp safely, and I hope to speak with him more on his experiences as an Eraian noble. Were he not as such, I believe you would find him quite palatable for your own guard.

Atalantia hails from the tribal lands of the north, and as such, has quite deadly mastery of her two swords. Her strong sense of justice is venerable, though I cannot concede I entirely agree with her views. Her customs are foreign to me, but as the leader of our party, I strive to understand them. Perhaps this is something that will come with time. 

Elfriede has generously offered his residence in the event that a courier need make a delivery on our venture. I humbly request a further shipment of clothes and books, the titles of which you will find below. 
```

Afina pondered for a moment whether to write that she missed her parents and country, but decided against it after some thought. “Wishing you love and knowledge always” she wrote, signing a curvy, neat “Afina” underneath it. She stood, brushing the wrinkles off her dress and placing the letter on the desk. 

Walking over to Elfriede, she pinned her family crest to her dress, before handing the knight her battle-worn garments. “Your help is most appreciated,” she said, stooping low to pick up the damp clothing, and laying it out on a nearby bench to dry. “Should you need a seamstress, I will be happy to provide in turn once the garments are dry,” Afina nods to her company, sitting back at the desk to continue her spell studies, small flickers of light radiating from the desk with each practiced spell.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-28*

Atalantia stands awkwardly, grasping one of her arms, in Elfriede's long and comforting shirt. Until this moment she truly forgot that her old clothes were torn, which saddened her slightly. Her clothes were a symbol of her pride and leadership in her Uinpeng tribe. Without them, she felt a bit lost.

She then glances outside the medical room's window once more in order to further grasp on to reality. Just a few hours ago she wasn't sure if she would be able to survive. But now she has been given a chance to further grow as a warrior with her new friends.

---
Atalantia then acknowledges her friends once more, and escorts herself outside the medical room making sure to take her dual blades with her.  If Atalantia was going to protect her friends, she had to get even stronger, and the only way to do that is to continue training. Atalantia then begins to practice some forms and techniques with her blades outside the military building.

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

Between the hunger you begin to feel and the sun rising well past the window in the medical room you get the distinct feeling it's getting quite close to noon. Before Elfreide and Afina can make any endeavor to scrouge up lunch for themselves, a mousey haired young man knocks on the door and peers in. 

"Milady, Sir Faun. The Commander has returned, we'd hope you'll be willing to join us?" he says, motioning for you to join him. He leads the way with a leisurely skip in his step.

A knight in heavy armor comes up slowly behind Atalantia. He is sure to be loud enough Atalantia can hear him, lest the whirling blades come for his neck. 

"Miss? The Commander has returned from the camp. He'd like you to join us in the mess." He says from a few dozen paces. He waits patiently before guiding the laguz back towards the outpost. 

- - -

The knight and mousey haired boy time their trip well, they lead the two groups to the mess hall doors at the same time while coming from opposite directions. They each push open a door and inside you can see the entire company gathered, whooping wildly as Narder stands at the head of the room, downing a mug of beer. Your guides filter into the room, grouping up with friends and joining the modest feast in the room. Every table is decorated with meats, breads and cheeses; all prepared like they aren't rations for a military garrison. Beer and wine is ever more prevalent, with in reach no matter where you sit in the room.

Ransford steps up next to the three of you. For the first time you see him without his armor, though you can tell by the bandages that it's only because he was just being treated. "I'd say successes should be celebrated." he says. He gives you a wry smile. "While I haven't forgotten it's your fault we had a problem in the first place..." He motions to a man who brings up a pair of mugs and wine goblet. 

"You certainly were instrumental in solving it. Cheers you lot." Ransford says with a raise of his own mug. At the word cheers the rest of the room seems to start paying attention, clanking glasses and hollering gaily. "Enjoy the festivities. No point leaving with half the day gone." He turns to leave but stops; pointing at Atalantia. "I know for a fact some of the men want to talk to you wolfie. Something about being bewitched by a Bladedancer?" he says, rolling his eyes at the apparent nickname you've been given. With that the Commander returns to his own chair, falling heavily into the seat and resuming his conversation with Narder and a few others.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-01*

Elfriede gathered his things togethor a few hours after after thier training sessions and was prepping for the journey south. He smiled lightly at his companions. Although he knew that they had some trials ahead, Faun and his strong companions would handle anything that gets thrown at them with heads held high. He packed his bag and removed his armour to get ready to sleep for the night. 
Elfriede left and returned after changing into his sleeping clothes, and massaging his cramped tail. He got in bed and blew out the candle that was at his bedside.
As he layed down in the provided bed he heard his companions do the same.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-01*

Afina unloaded her pack and laid its contents on her bed. She took stock of all the items that she had brought with them, before repacking the bag and placing it by the doorway to the room that the group shared together. Changing into her nightgown, Afina sat on the edge of the bed, deep in thought. _At least today had proven that her company could work well together_, she thought, turning over her light magic book in her hands. She had a couple low-level fire spells for the road, “borrowed” from a book in the outpost. They would have to last for the journey to Elfriede’s residence. 

Afina’s ears perked up as she heard the covers rustle, and a light snuffed out as Elfriede blew out the candle on his bedside. Afina glanced at her own candle, wavering and dancing in the night. _Fire, hm? It would be an interesting magic to learn, to say the least_, she thought. The princess crawled from the edge of her bed to the pillow, burrowing under the covers. The outpost beds were by no means comparable to that of home, but Afina got as cozy as she could. It was interesting, and in a way, comforting, to hear the minute movements and noises of her companions. At Tyndall Tower, it had been only her, and the silence was almost eerie. She bid her company goodnight, and blew out the candle on her bedside.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-01*

Atalantia was still disappointed in her abilities during training that afternoon. Perhaps she strained herself too much with the fight from Rica? Or maybe she had a lot more to learn than she originally assumed. 

Atalantia prepared her blades and got ready to rest. She was looking forward to the adventure ahead.

**Bill** - *2018-02-01*

The day goes quickly, probably because of how exhausted you are. A spot is set aside for you in the garrison for the night and the garrison offers what amenities to you it can. While not the most comfortable the rest is well needed and earned; it comes to you quickly and easily. 

When you leave in the morning, Ransford is the one minding the gate. He stands as your group approaches. "You three have caused more trouble in two days than I've had here in the last 6 months." he mutters. Then he pats Elfriede and Afina on the back while nodding to Atalantia. "Thanks. I was getting old, I could feel it." He steps back again. "Off the record of course. As is the entire debacle, since sir Faun here could afford to avoid that attention." Ransford opens the gate into Eraia sovereign territory. 

"Off with the lot of you. Next time you decide to go do something stupid, you know where to find me." He says with a smirk and leans against the gate. He makes a motion for you head through the gate. 

- - -

It's a few days travel to Effera after the garrison. For one of the major trade routes you see more soldiers than you do traders, probably owing to route bordering contested territories. You're able to camp by the natural border that marks the end of Eraia's sovereign territory, Byland lake. It's a very pretty lake, but across it you can see camps of soldiers and war tents which doesn't leave you terribly comfortable.

Your group is stopped once or twice on the road by soldiers with hands on weapons, but upon seeing Elfriede with uniform and insignia they relax and send you on your way. Each warns you to watch for soldiers coming from the east as it's always possibly they'll be Drecian.

- - -

Just after midday of your third day traveling you arrive at Effera. The town is surrounded with a wooden barricade, weathered but surely effective. You're stopped at the gate again, though the soldier in charge of this gate is far less enthused than Ransford was. He looks over Afina's paperwork particularly closely before returning it.

"Traveller's Inn is to the right coming out of the gate." he says boredly to Elfriede. "Welcome to Eraia, may Lylalel's light guide you to her in your visit." he adds to the group before motioning you inside the gate.

Inside is indeed a fairly large inn to your right, immediately attached to the wall side. The buildings you can see down the street are mostly wooden and seem residential. To the left is a stable, presumably for those entering town. There's a map by the inn, showing you a overview of the city's layout.

```
North: Barracks
West: Residential
East: Traveler's lodgings and commercial areas
Southeast: Trader's market space
Central: Church plaza
```

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

“Thank goodness we’ve finally arrived.” Elfriede says in a tired voice. He had passed through here a week and a half prior, but with the state of the market in this town he wouldn't be surprised if no one remembered him. People were constantly in and out. “First things first, now that we are further into Eraian territory there is some basics we’ll need to go over.” 

He pulls the group over to the side near the inn. “First, we should avoid any trouble so... that means no mistepping and talking badly about the Fair-Lady. We don’t want to invite trouble where there is none. Most Eraians **are** tolerant of foreigners and understand that not all of them worship Lylalel but talking badly about her isn’t going to get you far.” 

He sighs lightly and straightens up as he remembers his next point. “We should be clean in cities. While this is still rather far out from the capital the stigma holds… not that I mind.” Elfriede looks down on himself semi-disgusted with the filth that he’s had to ignore all this time. 

“Let us order a bath and a room at the inn where we can store our belongings whilst we shop. A sort of.. hub should we need it.” 

Elfriede looked back and forth at Afina and Atalantia making sure they understood. “I was given paperwork specifically for this occasion thus we shouldn't have to pay for our stay. *Then!* We can buy supplies for the rest of our journey and Atalantia clothes that fit her.”

Faun nods to them both and smirks. *He was more excited to bath then he would admit.* He walked passed the map and opened the Inn door looking back to his companions as he held it open. “I suppose one night’s rest here and food might be in order as well to regain our energy.”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

Afina folds her arms, inspecting the sign. She had done enough reading in her lifetime to know that, if they wanted to avoid trouble, that they should rid themselves of the grime of their journey. Eraia had many strict observances, and Afina knew of the weight that her visit carried for international relations. Callora and Eraia were in a stalemate of sorts. Callora was, rightfully, offended that Eraia had attempted to expand into their territory many years ago. For the princess of a prominent Calloran nation to be visiting, in pursuit of “learning of Lylalel’s light”... it was unusual, to say the least. 

She nodded in response to Elfriede’s warnings. Naturally, they weren’t prominently directed at her; It was Atalantia that they needed worry about. Eraia tended to accept laguz, but also segregated them, which meant their cultural views might not be as comfortable as their governmental policy was. Not to mention, hailing from the tribal lands, Atalantia had much less cultural savvy than the two nobles she travelled with. Afina was worried, but as long as Atalantia managed to refrain from _saying_ anything rude, they would be fine… hopefully.

Grateful to finally be getting a bath on their fifth day of travel, Afina was in accordance with their plan. A quick bath, renting a room for the night, and some shopping was in due order. And clothes… Afina loved her travelling clothes, but she _did_ the regal appearance of her loungewear. She followed close behind Elfriede, peering into the inn behind him. “Agreed,” she said. “This is one of the more comfortable locations that we could spend the night.”

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-05*

Atalantia approached their destination while still in her wolf form. Her fur flowed gracefully in the wind, but was soiled with plenty of dirt from their travels.  One could tell that Atalantia was relieved to have arrived because her moaning song had stopped and transformed to one of eagerness and excitement. Despite excitement for the travel to end, Atalantia was still quite embarrassed to show up in a new town with torn clothes on and the fact that her white fur was disgustingly tainted made her skin crawl. While Atalantia was of a tribal nature, she was a strong believer in cleanliness and first impressions. 

Atalantia was quite impatient to find a  place to wash up and buy new clothes, but she listened to her friends with the best attention she could muster. 

"First things first, I certainly do need to bathe otherwise I will not be able to think straight nor be of much help" Atalantia said while shaking a bit. Clearly she was not one to handle being dirty for long. 

"I also see no reason why we all would talk poorly of anyone, unless there was a true reason to do so? 
I also insist that if we all do want to look our best that we find clothing for me as soon as possible. I truly don't want to embarrass either of you."
Atalantia stated towards her friends. Atalantia was fairly concerned that her friends were worried about Atalantia's presence in a new location. She only wished to form the best impressions she could of herself for everyone, and she wanted to continue to build more trust with her friends. 

Upon looking towards the Inn, Atlantia was clearly fidgety and desired a bath and good night's rest.

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

As you enter *The Traveler's Lodge* a bell on the door rings briskly through the main room. "Welcome ye to Lylalel's light; welcome to my shelter from the dark." You hear from the man behind the desk. The lodge is not your typical inn. There is no bar in the main room, the room is instead set up in a smaller separated sitting areas with couches and tables. One of these is by a fireplace on the east wall. There's a staircase on the far side of that wall as well. Two doors are on the back wall, one on either side of the man's counter space. On the counter is a small pedestal holding a snow white candle, burning despite the midday hour. Two shards of glass sit in the rim of the candle's holder, making it look like it once had a glass shell but most of it broke. 

After Elfriede responds 'We are sheltered and blessed by Lylalel', the man smiles and roots around beneath his counter for a moment. When you approach he has three keys in hand, one with a square bow and two with circular ones. "Women's baths to the right, men's to the left." he says, pushing the keys in each direction. "Keys are for the locking cabinets you can stow your possessions in." 

Inside each door is a similar room. The center of the room is a grouping of benches and chairs with a small table or two between. The east and west walls are lined with cabinets with key holes, true to the host's words. Steam wafts from the hallway directly opposite the door. You can hear the sound of water beyond that hallway.

The bath area itself is fairly large, almost half the room being a warm water pool, 3 feet deep all around. The steam definitely wafts from this pool, you can see the light misting of it on the water. Across from that is a 1 foot deep pool with water flowing down from above. This miniature waterfall never seems to fill the pool, the flow into and out of the pool is perfectly in sync. There's a smaller pool with a bit of a current to it, it also seems soapy as people scrub themselves clean and let the current wash away the grime. People are relaxing in the pool and washing their hair in the waterfall area. 

When you leave the baths, warm and refreshed, you find out there's no charge for the use of a Traveler's Lodge. The lodge is funded by church donations. The clerk then urges you visit the local church, as it's truly integral to being in Eraia. He lets you know there are rooms for rent on the second and third floors of this building if you'd like, or there is other lodgings on the other side of the city. He then turns to another guest with the same welcoming phrase as before.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-07*

Faun sighed as he entered the bathing area. He had gotten pretty good at the song and dance of concealing his *”families secret”* but it had always put a great deal of stress on him. 

“Ah.. but I really do want to bath though.” He said quietly to himself. Elfriede removed his armour and disrobed down to his pants. He swiftly wrapped a towel around his waist and kicked his trousers and undergarments off, placing them into his locker. 

He shuffled to an open spot in the water and got in, as far away from others as possible. He submerged himself never stopping to remove the towel; People usually shrugged it off as if he was really shy and usually didn't give him much trouble.

Elfriede relaxed for a moment and then proceeded to clean all the built up…. *everything* from the events earlier this week. They had really been through a lot in a short time together. 

A short time later he emerged refreshed and dried off. He noted his tail was no longer matted down and gross and was fluffy once more, which somehow gave him a strange satisfaction.

Elfriede put on his clothing and armour once again and gathered his things before heading into the lobby. He leaned up against the wall by the women's baths to wait for Afina and Atalantia to emerge refreshed themselves. 

“I haven't seen you clean in a while. I was beginning to forget what my traveling companions looked like after a good bath.” He mused at ~~Afrin~~ Afina when she exited. He decided not to press after noticing her light scowl.

"Once Atalantia arrives we'll head out to the market to buy clothes and neccesities if you are ready."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-07*

Upon enetering the female bathing area, Atalantia found herself talking more to Afina. Both individuals try to shine light on their perspectives of matters involving culture and personal abilities. While Afina did not go too in depth with her own personal background, Atalantia was glad to finally get a moment to form more of a bond. 

Atalantia chose to lay back into the calm bath water and closed her eyes as she conversed with Afina. It had been a long while since she received a thorough cleaning both physically and mentally. Physically the bath helped to sooth Atalantia's tense muscles that were still recovering from the injuries sustained during the battle with Rica. Mentally, the bath helped to provide a sort of relaxation that Atalantia had not felt in a long time. Since the start of her journey she was encountering new experiences every day such as learning of new areas, earning trust from her friends, and fighting against her own laguz kind in order to seek a sort of justice for their crimes. Such experiences were vastly different from the ones Atalantia encountered in her tribe, and they all seemed to happen at once. Atalantia wasn't necessarily saddened by any of these experiences, but she was certainly mentally drained from it all. Despite this fact she couldn't necessarily consult in her friends either, for she refused to seem weak. Therefore, the bath seemed to be the best and greatest method of self care that Atalantia could find at this moment.

Noticing Afina leave the bathing area, Atalantia took a few more minutes to enjoying the relieving properties that the bath had to offer. She made sure not to take too long, and eventually grabbed her towel and torn clothes in effort to prepare to meet with Elfriede and Afina.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-07*

Afina exited the changing room, her elegant features pulled into a grim frown. Elfriede greeted her as she exited, and she nodded solemnly. “Naturally, a bath was in order for all of us,” Afina replied, her neutral tone giving her mood away. A pang of guilt ran through her; Elfriede nor Atalantia was to blame for any of the things affecting her mood right now. Why should she take her feelings out on them?

Afina straightened up and relaxed her shoulders in an effort to calm herself. She shouldn’t be taking out her feelings on her friends. "Once Atalantia arrives we'll head out to the market to buy clothes and necessities if you’re ready," Elfriede said, and Afina folded her hands over her lap.

“Well, that would be the best place to acquire provisions for our trip. We may be in Eraia already but there is still much ahead of us. And after our training sessions, my books seem to be getting thinner and thinner,” she laughed, trying to sound good-natured. Perhaps such a skill wasn’t necessarily the princess’ forte, however. Her awkward laughter peetered out, and and awkward silence fell between the true. Thankfully, it was soon interrupted by Atalantia.

“To the market?” Afina inquired, nodding towards the door.

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

The town of Effera is small enough a few signs is enough to navigate you on your way to the markets. On your way, you pass through the church plaza at the center of town. The two story church is larger than any building in the area, and as tall as the watch towers along the walls. Your parties foreigns had heard about the black stone churches of Eraia, but there's nothing quite like seeing one. You both feel pulled into the shadows of the architecture and released by the sun's rays on it's highlights. The building is in stark contrast to every other building in the town, stone and intricate while everything else is wood and simplistic. The contrast only adds to the grandeur of the building. It's rather amazing how the massive building can feel both warm and cold at the same time.

You can see the market down the next long street to to the southeast. It's an odd thing, it's more like an open area the town's buildings where over a dozen of trade caravans have parked their wagons. Traders lounge about around unlit fire pits, swapping stories and wares on occasion. You can see some more local folk walking around and mingling with the trader's as well, looking in the backs of wagons in a very casual shopping experience. It gives the feel of a rest stop or bazaar rather than a market.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-12*

After buying their much needed provisions, weapons, and clothing, and exploring the little slice of Eraian culture, the group returned to the inn for much needed rest. Elfriede went through his normal routine of removing his armour and readying himself for bed. He layed down in the comfiest bed that he had been able to sleep in since Tyndall tower. It wasn't the best, but it felt like a cloud after all the trials they had been through in the last week or so. Faun fell asleep only moments after laying down. 

Later that night, Elfriede was awoken by a russeling sound. His training had made him something of a light sleeper. He cracked one eye to see the sillouette of Afina getting up out of her bed and leaving the room. He sighed lightly to himself thinking he should go after her, but was paralyzed by how tired he was.

*I guess she desereves some alone time. And what better time then now...* He reasoned to himself as he drifted back to sleep.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

The culture of Eraia seemed vibrant despite the small size of the trading town. Through Elfriede, Afina was able to interact with the locals, and hear about the culture of the foreign country. Afina almost wondered by tensions continued to be high between Eraia and Callora. Her choice to visit Eraia had been a bold one, but thus far she didn’t regret the decision.

Afina returned to the inn fatigued, but excited from her adventures of the day. The princess changed into her nightgown and climbed into bed. On either side of her, Afina’s companions had already fallen asleep, but she laid there, her mind racing. There were huge implications for foreign relations to be made about her voyage to Eraia. She couldn’t disappoint her kingdom.

Afina sat up from bed, shoving her feet into her boots, and walking briskly to the door. She opened it gingerly, hoping not to disturb Elfriede and Atalantia. The door closed with a gentle _thunk_ and Afina cautiously walked down the hallway to the inn’s main lobby, a book shoved under one arm. 

In the main room, the innkeeper had disappeared, replaced by a small bell that was to be rung should a guest require something. Afina sat in one of the high chairs near a window, the light of a nearby candle illuminating the blank page of the notebook. She poised to write, but found trouble thinking of what she wanted to convey.

```
Dearest Father,
A further update on the status of my travels, I have successfully arrived in the city of Effera. It is a small, quaint city, and a respectable place to become accustomed to Eraian culture. There are many strict observances here, though Elfriede possesses enough cultural capital to guide us effectively through his country’s customs. 

Elfriede is proving to be, in fact, a most formidable knight and escort. He had offered valuable insight into Eraia, and also begun instructing me in the use of the sword. I confess that I have no gift; a swordsman such as yourself must recall what it was like to learn what I am now learning. It is proving quite the challenge, but I believe in Elfriede as a teacher. 

Atalantia, as well, has been making a valiant effort to understand Eraian culture, much to my surprise. She is honest in her intentions of comprehending the world around her. I'm afraid there are some things she will never make sense of, but I respect her efforts in trying. 

The journey has been relatively quiet since we left the Eraian military checkpoint. Our days consisted of mostly walking and training, though we have also been able to exchange stories of our experiences while on the trails. Suffice to say, I have learned much from our five days of travel already. 

I hope that these experiences will prove valuable to the people of Laera. Has the country begun preparations for the next festival yet? I was hoping to be able to visit for such a celebration; I believe if would be of utmost importance that the kingdom is reminded of its princess in these turbulent times.
```

Afina signed her name at the bottom of the notebook, before closing it. Hopefully she would remember to mail it in the morning. She rested her head on the windowsill, staring at the moon in the clear night. It was comforting to know that the very same moon stood high above her, spread light over the people of Laera Soon after, the princess herself dozed off, head and arms still resting on the window sill.

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Your inn is comfortable, far more so than the trail or garrison you've recently slept in. Be it the down of the pillows or the comforts of a roof overhead you awake well rested. 

Not a block after leveling the inn in the morning the three of you hear a commotion going on. As you turn the corner you can see a group of town guard escorting a handful of people through the streets. Peering through the crowd, you can see 3 Eraian soldiers in the center, their armor dented and damaged while their faces are bloodied. One holds one of his arms in the other, and his ally favors his right leg. Behind them in the midsts of the escort are two laguz, one man, one woman, dressed in damaged clothes. They follow after the soldiers with worried expressions. On their exposed skin you can see plenty of bruises and wounds as well. 

"Clear a path, clear a path!" the lead guardsman shouts. His hand rests on his sword hilt threateningly. "Not much further to the church men." he says behind him. Indeed it is not, you're not a block away from the stone building.

Following the group to the church you see a priest walk out the main doors as the escort approaches. The Eraian onlookers all part at once, leaving no one between the doors and the escort. The priest steps aside and the escort continues forward into the church. The third man, who was heavily leaning on a guardsman, falls to his knees just inside the doorway. The other two soldiers turn around, look to him, then come to their knees next to him. They begin, of all things, praying. It's a few minutes of this strange set of priorities. The guardsman step aside to leave them be, and the priest comes up behind them, resting a hand on the shoulder of the first man to fall to the ground. 

The priest steps away, and in another moment you can see the third man slump in his armor. The action sends a sudden chill down your spine. You can't help but recognize the life leaving the man. There's a quiet moment as the two remaining soldiers clasp a hand on their fallen compatriot's shoulders. They then stand, and with the laguz and guardsman head towards the military area at a much more leisurely, if pained pace. The priest steps forward over the dead man, saying words you can't make out. Two other men of the cloth arrive from inside the church, and they three of them close the outer doors. The crowd murmurs various phrases and begins to dissipate.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-12*

Elfriede frowns at the display. “This is not Eraia at its finest.”, he says low to his companions.

“The damn Drecan conflict…” He looks down and thinks for a bit. “We should probably move on, the locals here get frequently unsettled being so close to the border, but it has been some time since a drecan set foot here so fret not.”

*Afina suddenly turns to Elfriede asking for answers.* Faun was shocked to see Afina so suddenly emotional. "They wanted to die in the church, to offer thier final prayer to Lylalel. Most likely they had fatal wounds beyond repair and were holding on for that moment. 'Tis not uncommon Lady Tyndall, especially in this town... so close to the fighting. I'm sure they considered themselves lucky as most don't make it back." Elfriede recites it all in a learned, matter-of-fact way, not showing the same emotion towards the event as Tyndall. However, there was also a tinge of sorrow in his voice, as if this was just was something he had accepted. A bitter pill to swallow.

Elfriede repositions his pack, sighs lightly and begins leading the party towards the south gate. 
“I wouldn’t worry about the injured folk, they’ll be taken care of. Though perhaps we should inquire with the guards on the way out.”

Faun walks for a bit thinking.
“With all that’s going on we might want to take the trail through the woods instead of the normal road. I just get a bad feeling… I’d never be able to forgive myself if you two got injured in a war you aren’t a part of.”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

Though the princess’ entire travelling party was curious to see what would be made of the injured soldiers, it was Afina’s lingering that forced the group to stop. The princess gasped as she saw the ragged soldiers, covered in blood and battle damage. _Why wasn’t there a medical mage helping them?_ Afina thought, scanning the crowd for such assistance. But no one from the crowd stepped forward, instead keeping their distance and gawking at the bloodied men. The lead soldier indicated that they were close to the church, and Afina was relieved. _Of course, the priest would have healing powers_. 

The doors to the black stone church flew open, and the escort party walked inside. A straggling third man falls to his knees with a resounding _thunk_, and a silence falls over the spectating crowd. The priest doesn’t move. Instead, the soldier’s company turns around, joining their brother in arms on the ground in prayer. Afina’s brow furrows; _Why isn’t anyone helping these men?_, she thinks.

Finally, the priest moves, stepping in front of the first fallen man, and reaching out a hand to his shoulder. The movement is brief, and with a soft clang of armor, the man slumps over. Afina’s hand covers her mouth in horror, as the man’s compatriots stand, and depart in the direction of the military compound. Afina can’t take her eyes off the collapsed soldier on the church floor, even as the priest steps over his body. The doors to the church then close, and the crowd disappears. 

Afina is left staring at the church doors, even after the commotion had died. Peripherally, Afina hears Elfriede murmur a few words, but her mind was still reeling from the events. _Why didn’t anyone help him? Why did everyone just stare?_ Afina’s hands move to hug herself. _Why did they just let him die_, she wondered, face slowly contorting into confused indignation. _How could anyone let their citizens die in such a way?_

Afina turns to Elfriede suddenly. “What was that?” she demanded in a hushed, yet urgent tone. Her eyes are glossy with the threat of tears as she searches Elfriede’s features for an answer. 

With an explanation, the party continues walking towards the south gate. Afina was still angered by the injustice of the Eraians’ actions; Her thoughts were obvious in the heavy, angry gait in her step. _Perhaps the tensions between Callora and Eraia make much more sense now_, she thinks. Suddenly the elaborate architecture and vibrant culture of Eraia had begun to lose its appeal.

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Your group heads south, through the woods. There's no trail to be found and the trip is rough, especially on Lady Afina. You are able to navigate successfully, both due to Elfriede's survival training in basic and Atalantia's lupine instincts. You manage to keep it to only two nights sleeping under the foilage. 

As you leave the woods you are either blessed or cursed with the sight of a Wyvern flight in action. Across the plains you can see them swooping and diving, dominating the vast plains with their speed. Something seems to be occupying their attention out there though and you are able to continue on your way unimpeded. You put the warzone behind you with only a scare of conflict. 

Others entering Ebonary don't look so lucky. Some wagons have claw marks in them, some have burns and others barely can be called wagons. What traders you see are miserable, at least those without full sets of guards. There is little laughter or joviality in the caravans you pass. The gauntlet this trade route has become shows it's toll on every man and woman traveling it. 

Ebonary itself is beautiful. Clearly expanding out from the coast line, the buildings along the coast are wonderful black marble with open balconies and views of the Emati Bay. The buildings directly on the water and expanding out towards the east are more wooden and brick based, but still clearly designed as a permanent home. Of note is a large number of Kissaelain people in the streets, looking ragged and tired. They don't bother you, but look on as you pass.

The docks are easily accessible. The docks themselves are massive, with dozens of ships in the port. Some large, some smaller, each vessel has people loading or unloading supplies. You can see the dry docks as well, huge open buildings for building ships in. The dry docks are abuzz with people working on ships. Not a single dry dock is empty; each dry dock contains an in progress ship.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-20*

Upon their arrival in town Elfriede takes a huge sigh of relief. The roads were even more dangerous than when he left for Theonovayne. He hoped silently to himself that it wasn't a sign for more devastation to come at the hands of Dreca and also was greatly relieved that he decide to take the group through the woods. 

“The faster we leave this town and head to Lyall the better. The boat will be at least greater than a day’s journey once we secure passage, so we will be sleeping aboard a night or two. Passage shouldn’t be hard to secure via the documents I arrived with; we just need to meet with the Harbormaster soon before he retires for the night so we can leave for Lyall in the morning.”

Faun’s eyes briefly locked with Afina’s, he knew the trip had been hard on her, but wasn’t sure of her current mental state. He noted the cuts and bruises on all the companions from the harder terrain. It pained him a bit that he had to bring her through the woods, but he had no choice. He had to constantly remind himself of his duty. Faun nodded to her and Atalantia and motioned for them to follow him to the harbormaster’s office. 

“We will bathe and rest after, getting this meeting done early is rather important.” he said more sternly then he intended. Faun hadn’t fully realized it but he was heavily on edge after glimpsing the destruction the Wyverns were causing on the roads. His instinct wanted to get his companions that he had come to care for as far from the border as he could...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Afina inspected the travelling caravans as they passed. Miserable, every citizen looked tragically miserable. Blood and battle damage seemed to plague every merchant, and even the citizens that passed looked ragged and tired. The war seemed to be taking a huge toll on Eraia; _this_ is why Laera avoided conflict at all costs. _Savages and religious crusaders_, Afina thought, _Interesting that such individuals would be locked in combat_. 

Elfriede spoke of their plans for the day, and the princess snapped out of her reverie, her eyes meeting his.  It had been a long two days through the woods; Small scratches and bruises dotted Afina’s face and arms. Despite her calm exterior, clearly the trek through the woods had thoroughly fatigued the princess. “Lead the way. Your directions are best in this territory.”

Afina followed close behind as they walked through the streets. She had spent much of their voyage the last few days thinking. About Eraia, about the war that raged on right at the border, about her companions. Atalantia had remained her usual self, full of vibrant determination. But Elfriede…?

His stern voice and set jaw gave his emotions away all too well. Elfriede was clearly on-edge, if not a bit anxious. Afina glanced down, noticing his hand tensing over the hilt of his rapier. _Even in friendly territory?_ she thought, eyes back to analyzing the knight’s face.

She placed her hand on his forearm. “Don't worry, we’ll arrive at your family’s residence soon.”

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

You aren't a block into Ebonary before a bucket of water is dumped on Elfriede's head from a balcony. Not a moment after water splashes over Afina and Atalantia as well. There's a shout from over the balcony railing and though you cannot see the speaker the voice sounds like a old woman.

"One must be clean in the cities of Lylalel! Your grime and dirt attracts the shadow of Lyarlel!" she bellows, and you hear a door slam. Her actions are... excessive, but you aren't bothered by anyone else for skipping the Traveler's Inn on your way into town.

- - -

Ebonary is a busy city even before you reach the harbor. People move from shop to shop on every road, and the three of you are never truly alone. The people seem relaxed, some taking the time to enjoy the fall weather while others continue their work diligently. It's not hard to make your way to docks given their size, and the harbormaster's office is easy to spot. The easy mood seems infectious as you look over the harbor. The traders who were so worn out on arrival now speak gaily with sailors and other traders, peddling and moving wares from boat to wagon and back again. 

The harbormaster calls you in immediately after you knock, reads your paperwork, and sends you on your way. It's to miss the massive stack of papers on his desk, obviously the reason for his less than social attitude. He presents you with the iternary of two ships, a cargo ship that can take you aboard tomorrow morning and a military ship with a little more in the way of comforts and security that departs in three days. He lets you know either will take your group, simply present the paper work.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

They walked through the streets in silence, Elfriede preoccupied by his worries, and his two companions analyzing the surrounding town. Suddenly, water splashes over the railing of second-story home onto Elfriede’s head, and Afina’s eyes turn to glare at the individual above. She never glimpses the perpetrator; Moments later, water splashes into her own face. Coughing and sputtering, the voice of an old woman above reprimands the group as Afina clears the water from her lungs. 

“You insolent little-,” the princess begins, before the abrupt slamming of a door cuts her off. Afina shot a glance at Elfriede, as if to say “I told you so”
---

Once they had departed the harbormaster’s quarters, Afina takes the two itineraries to analyze them. She glances back and forth between the two documents. “Hm. Well. While I would appreciate the security of the military ship, it seems that the cargo ship would bring us to our destination much faster.” She glanced at Elfriede; his face remained unchanged. 

“I motion that we board the cargo ship tomorrow,” Afina says, straightening her posture to that of a princess. “Are there any opposed? And perhaps in the meantime we can explore the city.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-23*

Water violently rained on the knight lieutenant which pulled him out of his deep thought. He angrily glanced up at the closing door and then back to his companions. “*Eccentric old coot.*” he whispered to himself as he eyed Afina’s questioning stare. 
---
*After the visit to the harbormaster the group had stepped outside to go over the documents and discuss plans.* 
“I agree Afina, we don't need to sacrifice time for protection on a short journey across the sea that is completely surrounded by Eraian territory on all sides. The cargo ship will do just fine.”
A strange sensation came over Elfriede. They were soon to be back in Lyall. Home. He hoped that his companions felt the same warm feeling that he does when he returns. 

“Alright we can do some exploring for the rest of the night, but first we should return to bath else the sky open up and dump water on our grimy and dirty souls.” he recites sarcastically. Some of the older folk were very set in their ways...

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

Ebonary gives you a much better welcome after a bath. The night is bustling in the town, the docks don't seem to sleep as lantern light fills the area. The harbor shops district is alight as well, the Ebonary night life a necessity given the hours many sailors keep. And many sailors there are indeed; everywhere you go you see sailors taking in the land before heading out to sea. 

You can see so much more of Eraia's culture in the night at Ebonary than Effera. Every building has a single light in it you can see easily from the outside, each a snow white candle burning brighter than you feel it should. Black marble buildings dot the city, most of which are related to the church or military. Soldiers patrol rather frequently, especially around the bars. You can see at least one man being dragged away by soldiers in your evening out, swearing that he 'would never swear against Lylalel's name'. 

It's a pleasant evening about, truly Eraia at it's finest. It's never dark in the site, even in the presence of the black marble Eraia's churches are defined by. The darkest you saw was a corner of the docks, while walking along an overlook showing the docks and the bay. It is a tad odd, given you hadn't seen a single dark dock elsewhere along the the bay; especially not a dock with a ship in it. The rows of crates and barrels blend together in the dark, forming a miniature maze of sorts on ones way from the staircase down to the docked ship.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-28*

The evening was relatively peaceful, Elfriede calmed down a bit and suggested that they get food at a place a bit more upscale. He took the party to an inn where they enjoyed exquisite meal and eachothers company. 

Some time later after leaving the establishment they wandered the city a bit and came to the dock area (which admittedly took up a large portion of the city). Elfriede took a lackadaisical look around and saw that one of the docks lights were out which he squinted at as odd, but chose to ignore it as they did not need any more distractions right now by his thinking.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-03-01*

Atalantia thoroughly enjoyed the new cuisine. It wasn't quite the comfort food of hunted meats that she was used to, but there was a certain texture and flavor that appeal to her. Atalantia also enjoyed being able to spend the evening with her friends once again. 

Atalantia looked towards the darkened dock along with the rest of the party. Something didn't seem right to her, "Hey, is that normal?" Atalantia pointed at the dock while she asks her friends in hopes that they'd be able to give some sort of clarification. 
Shortly after asking the question, Atalantia stepped forward towards the darkened dock in order to get a better look.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

Ebonary seemed to truly come alive in the night time. The sailors and townspeople alike bustled around the town, the bright light coming from every inn and store lighting their way. People chattered, laughed, and cheered as the nightlife of the Eraian town was vibrant and joyful. Sailors had to have their last bit of fun before shoving off, after all. Even Afina loosened up, smiling and waving politely at the townspeople. Atalantia too, caught attention from the night life; a few sailors hollered and whistled at the passing laguz woman. Nevermind the fact that her muscles and strength rivalled their own. Afina might have been approached as well, had her shy attitude and her close trailing behind Elfriede not kept the suitors at bay. Though the night life was welcoming, the unfamiliar territory still had Afina on edge.

After dinner, the three of them walked along on the docks, in a most quiet and peaceful manner. All the docks were lit by “Lylalel’s light”... except for one. Elfriede seemed intent on avoiding the dock, but Atalantia had already stepped forward to investigate. As the wolf laguz began to investigate, Afina placed her pack on the ground and pulled out her light magic book. She had been practicing with fire magic for most of the week, hesitating on opening the binding of the thick book.

Shaking off the feeling, Afina opened the spell book, and a small beam of light glowed over Atalantia’s head. If the wolf laguz wanted to explore, the least she could do was assist. They had already been separated from Atalantia once, after all. Afina navigated the ball of light to lead Atalantia, its luminescent intensity casting shadows from the cargo across the docks.

**Bill** - *2018-03-02*

Despite the area's many twists and turns you don't find it difficult to navigate to the ship docked here. It's masts stand tall and proud, no matter how many crates stand between you and the ship you can see the crow's nest of the ship. As you turn around yet another corner made by yet another row of crates you see the ship come into view. It's a beautiful ship, larger than you could have guessed. The wood, despite the late hour, seems to have highlights of light in it streaking across it's frame. After a moment you realize this is merely a combination of light and dark wood, but your confusion at all validates the creator's work. The ship isn't just pretty either, you can see cannon ports on it's sides and the wheel from even where you stand. While it's in the process of being loaded with cargo you can tell the ship can hold it's own in naval combat.

As your eyes drift from the ship to the loading area you quickly can spot a group of people scurrying about. You wonder if the wine at dinner was too strong for a moment before you realize it is not an illusion, the figures have long ears flopping around from the tops of their head. It's rare to see Kouneli, or rabbit laguz, off of their island to the west. 

The Kouneli move quickly and efficiently, loading select crates into the hold of the ship while others scurry about on deck. They seem too preoccupied to notice you though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

The light extinguishes as Afina’s eyebrows furrow. “Rabbit laguz?” she asks, “This far east? Is Eraia that busy of a trading port?” _Surely they must have some interesting business to be all the way in Ebonary_, she thinks. _And for the ship to be so well defended, the crates sealed tight..._ 

Afina did not trust the nature of the situation; why would any battle-ready ship load sealed cargo in the dark? Especially in Eraia, where light was considered as much a staple as food and shelter. Her better nature wanted to intervene, at least to ask what the crew was doing. But doing so would put her at risk; Like she had thought in the Effera square, a Calloran princess had no right meddling in Eraian affairs. In a moment, Afina’s book was already stored away, and hand resting on the pommel of her sword. 

The princess caught Elfriede’s eye, and motioned down towards her sword. Should he find interference to be necessary, she was prepared to support him. She then turned back to the ship, analyzing the crew and its cargo.

There were many factors in deciding to intervene. The last time they had meddled in laguz affairs had been disastrous; would they really want a repeat of Rica? Afina wanted to bury the memory of how ashamed she had felt. Ashamed to have decided to investigate, ashamed of failing in combat, ashamed of relying too heavily on her comrades, and ashamed of the fatalities that had sustained as a result of her weakness. Even if Ransford had praised them for their efforts in the wake of their battle, she felt the detour from their voyage to be an embarrassing mistake. 

But she also had a duty to uphold. These very same laguz could be causing mischief and mayhem closer to Callora than she thought. And even if they were not, justice would have to be done to criminals. And no innocent person hides in the dark. Afina’s grip visibly tightened on her sword.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-05*

Elfriede waved to Afina and Atalantia dissmissively and spoke low. "This isn't our fight nor our problem. We should notify the town authorities and ask them to check it out. If they already know, then well... there is nothing to worry about."

Elfriede smirked. "We cant go around causing trouble *everywhere* we go now can we? Besides, theres no notible danger nor any problems; Although I agree that I find it odd. Just because something is out of place, doesnt mean that there is evil afoot. Even if they do plan to suddenly attack the capital tomorrow, a small brigade of rabbits is something I think that the gaurd can handle." He lightly pats Afina on the back, "Ease up a bit."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-03-05*

Atalantia was hesitant. Sure this wasn't our matter, and it would probably be best to tell the authorities, but what if something awful will happen? What if the authorities couldn't handle any misfortune that would occur?
Many thoughts such as these, filled Atalantia's head. But rather than cause her friends more conflict, she shook the thought off and rolled with it. 
"I agree... Telling the authorities would probably be best. It'll also allow us to make sure that all I known and in order." Atalantia stated. 

Worst case scenario, Atalantia was prepared to act if all went down

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

The Kouneli don't notice you as you retreat and head two docks over to the same harbormaster's building you arrived at this afternoon. It's all but fitting that, much like the rest of the docks, the harbormaster's office is light and buzzing with activity. Two captains are drinking over a business transcation in the foyer while another man sorts through paperwork with the clerk at the desk. The harbormaster is the next room over and you can hear voices from his office.

When you enter the clerk waves you into the harbormaster's office, despite it sounding occupied. Following her directions, you find the harbormaster in one of the two guest chairs, sitting across from a man in his mid thirties, dressed in white and purple. Before the foreigners of your party can assume he is a member of the clergy, you take note of the powerful looking sword and shield resting against the man's chair. The soldier has black hair, swept to the side and the only thing untoned on his frame is a subtle jawline. His eyes are a bright green.

"It appears you have work to do friend, let me step outside for some air and I shall see if you aren't busy when I return." the man says, standing up. He quirks an eyebrow at Elfriede, then smiles lightly. He says nothing, only giving a customary salute to a fellow military man. 

The harbormaster gets up slowly and swings around to the other side of the desk. "I remember you lot from this afternoon. What need do you have of me this late in the evening?"

- - -

The harbormaster, while clearly a little intoxicated at the start of the conversation, listens quite careful as you describe what you saw. As soon as the last breath of your story is told he shouts "Perrin! Grab Dynskl, rabids trying to overtake The Aster!" and you hear the clatter of a chair and footsteps pounding for the door. 

"Thanks for the information. Lylalel favors the charitable and those who protect her charges." he says quickly before running out of the room himself. You can see through the wide open door and windows the soldier from before with his weapons drawn and the harbormaster behind him, heading to the dock you were just at.

*The name Dynskl clicks in Elfriede's mind. While the young knight had only seen him from afar, there was no way he could forget the name of the Knight's Commander, leader of the Eraia Military. Dynskl Kelrr is the defacto military leader of Eraia and a powerful warrior in his own right. While the church commands the direction of the military, it's Dynskl who actually executes the missions in Lylalel's name.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-07*

Afina secured her brooch to her travelling cloak, adjusting it in the mirror of her small room at the inn. Their travelling party had elected for seperate rooms in preparation for spending many days in close quarters together. Passage on the boat would be uncomfortable, but the promise of reaching Elfriede’s residence made her hopeful. She had been curious to see the people that had raised such a dedicated knight. And Elfriede’s sister, Afina wondered about her as well. Elfriede seemed fond of her; Had Afina missed out by being an only child? 

Afina pulled up her hood, frowned, and then pushed it back off her head. She fidgeted with her hair, half-attempting to style it before giving up. Knowing that the wind off the sea would likely be fierce, the princess opened her pack, searching for a scrap of blue ribbon that she had acquired on their trip to the market. Afina pulled back her hair and secured it with an elegant bow. She turned back to the mirror and nodded, self-assured in beginning their journey.

She stepped out of the room, reconvening with her companions who seemed equally prepared for their endeavor to the shipyard. 
--
The port was once against bustling with activity in the light of day. Though not as lively as the nighttime, sailors hurried to their boats and people bode their relatives farewell. Afina leaned over to look at the paperwork that Elfriede had held onto. “Where might we find the boat?” she asked, adjusting the straps on her pack.

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

Elfriede presents your papers at the dock's main entrance and a crewman directs you to the right. You soon recognize the dock you end up at; it's the same dock you were at last night. As you once more snake your way through the walls of crates and barrels you can see some have cut marks in them. Apparently whatever went down last night came to blows.

Men are closing up ports and doing final checks of the prep for launch all over the ship. None stop to bid you welcome. Eventually, a middle aged man in the dress of a Captain comes up to the gangplank, looks over in your direction, then heads across it towards you.

"If I am not wrong, you are Lady Afina Tyndall and escort, correct?" The captain says once he's reached you. Affirming so with your papers, he nods. "We have two cabins set aside. I apologize, it is all we were able to spare as far as space. The Aster is a large ship, but she's overloaded with supplies for the city. I'm Uhes Chetlett, captain of the Aster." he gives a very curt bow to Afina. The man is muscular, but less so than most working on a cargo ship. Elfriede can recognize some military service medals on his jacket, though nothing outstanding. Uhes has no facial hair and dull brown eyes that seem to be thinking all the while you speak to him. He leads you up to the boat and soon your voyage commences.

- - -

During the first day and half you quickly piece together than the ship jacking you saw was thwarted without too much bloodshed. The sailors had been worried about a delay leaving yet most of the rabids gave in quickly. Many blessing to Lylalel were given for that.

- - -

The evening of your second day on board comes quickly. From the crow's nest a crewman calls "Ebonary is out of sight Captain!" and the captain nods.

"And Lylalel shall light our way home." he says to no one in particular. 

"Sir?" the crewman calls again. "We have a ship coming from due west." The captain quickly turns, his jacket fluttering behind him as he looks over the western rail with his spyglass. The captain looks from mast to mast with his spyglass while his crewman calls "She's smaller than us, looks Eraian in make. I'd say it's a warship sir." The crewman's relief is audiable in his call.

"And she flies no flag." The captain growls. He turns and pulls on a bell, which rings on every level of the ship. "I want all hands! I don't trust that ship!" he bellows. Men scramble about on every deck, many arming themselves. "Helmsman to the wheel, crowman keep us from getting parallel to her!" the captain steps down to the main deck, letting his helmsman take control of the ship.

It's not too long before the man in the crow's nest calls "Captain, she's out maneuvering us! She'll get along side!". The captain puts down his glass as the approaching ship turns.

"They have cannons, yet they aren't using them! They intend to board! Be on your guard!" the captain calls and it sets a dark tone over the men of the crew. Each is now armed and doing their duties with the utmost effort, all while keeping one eye on the encroaching ship. 

(ooc: you don't have to be on deck witnessing the above. That happens, but if your below deck you can spin it as you heard from a crewman who came to tell you, or anything you like. Set yourselves up on the ship in your post.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-10*

Afina nodded politely. "Yes, I am Lady Afina Tyndall, pleased to meet your acquaintance."  _Funny_, Afina thought as the captain led them along the boat. _Her courtesy training was so second nature that she had responded to the captain without hesitation_. The princess had almost surprised herself. 

As the captain explained the details of their journey, Afina's eyes wandered to Elfriede, who seemed to be intently listening to the captain. He seemed to be in a pleasant mood this morning; their conversation and private sleeping quarters must have done the knight well. _Good,_ she thought. _Perhaps Elfriede would give more credence to her queen's guard comment._ Had he thought about it? Perhaps she needed to be more straightforward in her offer. 

Afina mentally berated herself. How rude it would be to take Elfriede away from his family and culture and duty here! Just because she enjoyed his friendship and advice, did not mean she had the authority to take him from his current situation. She should take the situation as it was; a temporary journey. The princess stood straight as she heard the predicament of the bedrooms.

Afina looked at her companions, gauging their reactions to Uhes' news as the captain walked away. Elfriede had offered to give Afina her private space; as a princess this was something she was used to. But she decided against it, reasoning that she would rather not be stuck alone in such unfamiliar territory. She glanced between Elfriede and Atalantia. Why had Elfriede carefully avoided the idea of sharing a room with her? He _was_ her escort after all. Perhaps he was feeling awkward from last night, and his own personal space was necessary. Besides, Afina made a point that she would attempt to befriend Atalantia as well. 

Afina's choice was cemented by Elfriede's accidental bow. _The conversation last night must have made him feel conflicted between his mission and his friendship_, she thought. _He most definitely needs the space_. 

"That's quite alright," Afina nodded. "It's only natural that the two women share a room. Atalantia, would you like to share quarters?" Afina offered. She was apprehensive; she had never shared space with a laguz before. But perhaps there was a first time for everything. 

---

Afina quickly explored the vessel, and finding nothing particularly intriguing the first day at sea, she sat down to write to her father.

```
Dearest Father, 
How does my letter find you and mother? My company has just departed from Ebonary, a coastal town in Eraia. From here, we travel by boat to the other half of Eraia; Soon we are to stop at Elfriede's residence. Please do make sure that new books and clothes await us upon arrival. They are integral to the journey's success. 
 
Personally, I have seen improvement in my swordsmanship, as well as my fire magic abilities. There has been ample opportunity for learning on the road, and I have ceased every moment of it. I have continued to improve my abilities as a mage, and as a tactician. I have also engaged in diplomacy; I am learning the customs and culture of Eraia, and hope that it will shed light on their methods of international relations.
```

```
Thus far, I believe I have experienced both the positive and negative side of Eraian culture. Though I have been an outsider, Elfriede's assistance has also shown the best of what Eraia has to offer. 
 
In my travels, Elfriede Faun seems to be capable of serving as an advisor, protector, tutor, and friend on this journey. Not only has he successfully performed his duty as escort, but he has provided key advice and assistance in times of crisis. How soon might it be until I can commence building my own staff? If conditions permit, I wish to leave a place for the knight. Though my rule may be a ways away, I have not met a more qualified individual to have among my council.
 
Atalantia, too, is performing well. Her skill with dual blades is unparalleled, and she continues to inquire about the world we have travelled through. Though I'm afraid cultural barriers separate us greatly, I look forward to conversing more with her, and gaining a deeper understanding of her world. Perhaps she may also become a devoted friend in time. 
 
The ship we are traveling on is well-equipped, and the captain has been most courteous in our endeavors. We are slated for a few days of travel, and then we will arrive at Elfriede's home. How is mother? And Master Witella? I hope everyone at home is happy and healthy.
 
Afina
```

The princess put down her pencil with a sigh, standing from her desk. The stuffy room was far too warm for Afina's liking. Maybe the cool ocean breeze would help. 
 
Afina glanced about the room; she had not seen Atalantia since earlier that day. Perhaps she would find the laguz warrior roaming about above deck. 
 
---
 
Afina leaned on the rail of the deck, watching the ocean waves roll by. The breeze tousled her hair, the ribbon on her blue bow whipping in the wind. It was a peaceful sight; Afina had never been one much for the ocean in Laera. The crewmen roved about lazily as the captain stood at the mast of the ship, gazing through his spyglass. 
 
A sudden commotion on deck made Afina turn around. The shouting between the captain and the crewman in the crow's nest means that something must truly be amiss. Afina's hand goes to her sword, the only weapon she carried on her at the moment. She had assumed that they would not engage in combat while on the water; the princess had armed herself mostly out of a desire to look imposing, and her pride over becoming a recent swordsman.

The crewmen began rushing about, arming themselves and bolstering the ship’s defenses. “We’re being… attacked?” Afina wondered aloud. _By another Eraian ship, no less._ Afina hesitated, glancing between the door to the bunks and the incoming ship. She did not trust her swordsmanship enough to use in true combat yet. She had to acquire her books. 

“They intend to board!” rang out across the ship as the captain positioned his crew into fighting stances. Afina ran towards the bunks, weaving through the flurry of commotion that had become the deck. Her heart was beating hard in her chest from the combination of running and fear. _Another fight? So soon?_ It felt like their brush with the laguz was just yesterday. 

Afina hurriedly retrieved her books, pausing to consider the implications of fire magic on a boat. Perhaps it was best not to summon fire while resting on, what is essentially, a giant tinderbox. The princess tossed the fire book back onto the bed, clutching her book to her chest. She had elected to leave the dagger as well; her last fight with the dagger had yielded much embarrassment. She would have better luck with the sword. 

Returning above deck, Afina opened her book, joining the crewman in watching the enemy ship with vigilant eyes.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-11*

Elfriede nods respectfully to Uhes as he addresses them. Although much of what he was saying was lost on him, as his mind was preoccupied with last night’s events. He thought of the showdown at the dock that had apparently happened the night before. How could a ragtag group get so far? To be able to do something malicious right in the heart of the city? Clearly the city wasn't as locked down as he believed, which made him all the more relieved to get his friends out of Ebonary and out of harm's way.

There was also the interaction in his room last night that was clouding his thoughts. He was overjoyed that Afina was taking a liking to him and opening up. But he couldn't help but wonder how she would feel if she knew the truth. Would she understand? His gut wanted to say yes, as she was a Princess of Laera, one of the most accepting communities in all of Aurii. ...But the doubt lingered still. Regardless, the current relationship with his friends made him happy. Something so simple like an embrace, made him realize what he was lacking. He’d have to be content with that. 

Faun snapped out of his thoughts as Uhes covered the situation of the bedchambers. 

After he brought them aboard and departed from the companions Elfriede spoke up. “If you’d like your privacy Afina, I could probably find somewhere else to sleep. Among cargo maybe?” *Elfriede thought about ways to hide himself from someone he would sleep in the same room with. He could probably find a closet to change in or something. As long as he was careful…*
“I could also room with Atalantia. Whatever you decide I will honor it.” He gives a slight bow, but then Afina’s words echoed in is mind. ```“Feel no need to bow, Elfriede. Though we began this journey as charge and escort, I’m proud to call you a dear friend now. Which means there is no standard for bowing.”``` 

“A-ah.. sorry. It has become a bit of a habit.” Flustered, he straightens and awkwardly apologizes.

Faun wandered above deck every now and again returning passed Afina's quarters to check on her. He passed another soldier aboard and gave him a brief salute. The soldier smiled and went on his way giving praises to Lylalel.

“It's probably about time I check on her again. It's been a few hours.” He said as he about-faced and returned to her door mere minutes after she exited the other way. She had left the door ajar, so Elfriede knocked lightly. 

“Are you in there Afina?” He said as the door swung open from the force of his knock. He stepped in and glanced around spying a small parchment out on the desk. “Did I leave the documents in here? Why would I -”

He stopped as he noticed it was a letter written in neat handwriting. Clearly Afina's. *I really should respect her privac--!* Elfriede saw his name in the letter. Curiosity began to overwhelm him. “Maybe if I just read that part.” He felt abhorrent as he picked up the letter.

As he skimmed through it his face felt flush with all the compliments. *Why does she feel the need to compliment me for just--* …her staff?! Elfriede placed the letter down and ran outside to the boat rail for some air as he was feeling flush. Would he? He wouldn't just leave his family and country. He had too much built here. 

Not wanting to think about it too much he shook his head and decided to look for Atalantia instead.

---
Feeling very cramped and board Elfriede decided to help the crew on the next day with odd jobs. His muscles had yearned to be used as he was always exercising and on the move, especially lately. One of the crew members had cracked a joke which Elfriede chuckled at. 

He suddenly heard the cry of a panicked sailor and instinctively glanced around. He drew his rapier and ran above deck to see what the commotion was and stopped when he saw Afina turned around looking out into the sea whilst holding her book.

“What has happened?!” Although as he said it he saw the dark shape in the distant sea and realized what rather… was about to happen. Although he felt he shouldn't feel this way... Faun felt a tinge of excitement.

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Frantic calls are made from the crow's nest as you meet up on the deck of the Aster. You recognize them as degrees of rotation; the sailor the crow's nest is directing the helmsman on how much to turn. The helmsman replies with an strong 'aye' every time; every other second is a call out from the man. 

It does little good, and everyone on board seemed to know it from the start. The smaller ship is easily able to copy any movement the Aster makes and begins its approach to come parallel to her. Uhes appears behind the two of you.

"I take it by your arms you intend to fight?" He asks rhetorically. "I'll leave you to your own devices for the most parts, we have not the spare men to give you any special treatment. Here is your crash course." he says. He first points the masts of the enemy ship. 

"The mast men are going to swing over here and disrupt our work as best they can. They're just the first wave however." Uhes points to the deck of the other ship, where you can see men prepping gangplanks. "The gangplanks will bring most of their forces. The faster we can get those planks off our ship the better. The mast-men will attempt to keep us from it however." 

"I'd bet my cabin the enemy has an anima mage on them. We need to prevent them from lighting our masts aflame. Once we're dead in the water there's no real hope for us. They'll likely take potshots from the safety of their own ship though." Uhes grimaces. "If you spot their captain, he'd be an excellent target. Pirates aren't chaos incarnate, without a leader they tend to fall back." The enemy ship makes it's final approach. You can now see that every man and woman on that ship is a rabbit laguz.

"Hell." the Captain says. He then bellows out to the crew: "It's the rabid pirates! Stay not your blades men; they surely won't hold theirs!" He looks back to you. "This group has been a plague for months. They hate Eraians. It's possible you'll receive fair treatment due to your Callorian heritage Milady, but... I'd personally rather not see a lady in the hands of pirates." Uhes says. "I truly mean it, stay not your arms. These rabids are fanatical, they'll be not swayed by words or bribe."

Uhes looks up as the mast-men swing over each of your heads, landing on the ship and engaging the sailors of the Aster. "If we can throw enough of their plan to the wind, maybe we can drive them off. Lylalel bless your steel." he says over a shoulder as he rushes a pirate, and suddenly the deck is a blur of activity. You can hear gangplanks attach to the sides of the Aster and the whoosh of spell craft. The captain had the pirate's plan down to a T.

(ooc: The Target represents what you need to end the encounter. I'm going to experiment with having it unassigned until you complete some of the sub goals, to represent that you can't win without interfering with the enemies plans first. Every side goal doesn't need to be completed. I'll update the target with a number as soon as victory is on the table. 

For a further clarification on the side goals; Gangplanks involves unhooking the planks that connect the ships and/or preventing men from traveling across them. Mast-men are simply mooks running about on your side of the ship, targeting them frees up sailors to help keep the ship afloat. Sabatours are mages on the other ship; if you can get to them their defeat (rules wise they're mooks) will prevent heavy damage to your ship. You can freely sink dice into `Find the Captain`, you don't need to do anything special to do it. Doing so will reveal the captain himself who you can aim to defeat.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-12*

Elfriede steadied his breathe to take in all the action around him. The main bulk of the force is coming from the planks. He has got to at least cut one off. He looked to Afina to see how her mental state was. She looked confident which helped ease some of his stress. His mind was going over possibilities of getting them out of this alive, but the only way forward seemed to be to defeat the pirates. It’s not like they have anywhere to run if they lose. The companions have no choice but to be victorious today.

Elfriede felt that same fire in him that he had felt so many times. He nodded to Afina. It seemed as though they were thinking along the same lines, but he felt the need to reiterate when they both knew. 

“We’ve got to get you somewhere high Afina, so you can give those casters hell.” He shouted over the huge battle that began to ensue. Faun looked over to the staircase that led to the upper deck which was right near where a plank had landed and enemies poured over it. Good placement; he’d have to shut one of the planks down completely to have any real impact.

He looked to Afina and back to the enemies. “Seven of them. Let's do it.” He drew his dagger into his off hand and sprinted toward the stairs. The two rabbit laguz closest to him were turned around focused on getting to the upper deck. There was too much at stake in this fight to allow them to turn around. Faun slid downward and pierced both of their knees straight through. Both of them winced heavily while Elfriede, continuing his forward momentum, ran shoulder first into the two of them. The pirates being off balanced causing a domino effect on most of the laguz in the way. 

“Go!” he shouted back as he jumped onto the plank to engage the pirates currently crossing. 

 He knew Atalantia would take care of most of the masses of pirates on the ship. The more in one place the better.. and Afina can handle herself, in fact she was most likely the key to winning this fight. Mages in ship to ship combat are the lifeline of battle. Having one gave **huge** advantages that are not always present on the mainland… and they had multiple by the looks of it. Elfriede would hold the masses crossing the planks at bay while Afina took down the casters. Indeed it seemed like the only option. His heart raced from fear of the possibilities and from the excitement of battle.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

Afina spared but a brief moment to roll her eyes. _There’s never enough men to spare it seems_, she thought. With a burst of spellcast, Afina knew she was immediately going to target the other mage. Her own bravado played a role in such a choice, but tactically Afina also knew that taking out the mage could ensure the safety of the ship. 

The dull thunk of invaders jumping aboard pushed Afina into action. She and Elfriede exchanged glances, and Afina noticed that the knight looked confident, like that night before they had entered the laguz hideout. “We’ve got to get you somewhere high Afina, so you can give those casters hell,” Elfriede yelled, struggling to be heard over the clash of weaponry. He gestured towards the staircase to the higher part of the ship.

“Agreed,” she nodded, turning the page of her tomes to begin reading.

Suddenly, a plank landed near the entrance to the staircase with a dull _thud_, making the floorboards of their own ship shudder under their feet. Seven invaders began to cross, barraging onto the Aster in what seemed to be one huge charge. Elfriede took off running, and Afina prepared herself to assist. While the knight had discharged the first few invaders with relative ease, Afina hesitated; _Would he need assistance?_ she thought, watching as one rabbit laguz tumbled into the water, hitting the surface with a loud crash. _I guess not_. 

“Go!” he yelled, and Afina took off for the stairs, mumbling incantations under her breath. A crackling sparkle of light whizzed around her, piercing the arms and bodies of Kouneli caught unaware. She *was* going to make it to a higher vantage point; It was a strategic necessity. Only then could she find the other mage and defeat them. 

A sudden burst of fire from the enemy ship stopped Afina in her tracks and she gawked at the plume of flames. This was far beyond any fire magic she had accomplished in her limited time. And could light magic truly counter such a destructive force?

An overly confident attacker, noticing how distracted Afina was, raised his sword overhead with a yell. The princess noticed such a presence from the corner of her eye and reacted quickly, shoving her book under her arm and unsheathing her sword. The clang of metal rang out as the two crossed swords, the force of which reverberated up Afina’s arm. 
“Cease this violent nonsense!” Afina declared, lowering her sword into a more defensive position. A flicker of hesitation showed across the laguz’s face. Clearly her accent was not that of an Eraian. This meant that she was not necessarily the enemy, but perhaps the youth had decided that he did not care, raising his sword once more. 

However, his hesitation had bought Afina the time she needed. A pillar of light shot up from the ground, fully encasing the shocked rabbit laguz in a stream of bright, white light. _Well, if the other ship was unaware of my presence as a light mage, they must surely know now_, Afina thought, running once more for the stairs as her opponent was left in a heap on the floor. 

The princess felt confident. Though swordsmanship was new to her, it seemed that at least her defensive training had been effective. Her finesse with light magic had also seemed to return after their brush with Rica. Afina would say that their odds in this fight were quite well. 

Reaching the top of the stairs, Afina squinted out at the deck of the enemy vessel. Perhaps if the fire mage cast another spell she might be able to locate them...

Due to the size of the smaller ship there is only room for two gangplanks to connect the ships. The Kouneli make full use of them though, pouring onto the ship in droves. Despite the Aster being a much larger ship, it seems the attackers have a crew at least the same size as the Aster's, if not larger. The Aster's men are hardy however, engaging with the Kouneli quickly. The fighting is sloppy, but no one can deny the sailors have a lot of power to put behind their swings. The decks are a sea of men clashing swords, axes, and the occasionally club. 

Some Kouneli come across the gang planks in their laguz form; make you wonder why they get compared to rabbits at all. They're much too large and lanky, though they still have powerful back legs that pound the wooden decks heavily. Kouneli come in somewhere around the size of a large dog, the second tallest laguz (the first being tigers) despite being the second lightest (the first being cats).

Elfriede's impressive blade work was noticed by the Kouneli mages. A fireball comes flying at Elfriede, hitting the deck to his left. Thankfully ships are coated with a fire retardant material and Elfirede doesn't find himself in an inferno. One more comes his way before they resume aiming at the masts. The sabatours aren't hard to spot, sitting on the raised back deck of the ship and lobbing shots across the gangplanks.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-15*

Elfriede jumped onto the plank and began to move toward the crossing Kouneli group to funnel them into a constant one on one fight, thinking himself a superior fighter. Several of them moved to engage Elfriede, but found themselves falling off the plank into the waters below; many of them sporting new leg wounds. A constant mix scraping metal and shouting resounded as Elfriede continuously knocked weapons aside and knocked the rabbit folk from the boarding plank. *If he could just hold this for a bit to buy Afina time…* One male came forward with reckless abandon, swinging repeatedly pushing Elfriede back a bit. 

“So sloppy; typical of a pirate.” Faun boasted a bit and suddenly moved forward in wake off the pirate’s swing. His pommel came forward and collided squarely in their face causing blood to run freely from the pirates nose. In a last ditch effort, the pirate came across horizontally with a hard swing of his sword. It hit nothing as Elfriede had already crouched and raised his dagger to knock the sword up in the air. Faun brought his sword up and directly through the Kouneli’s arm causing him to drop his weapon and howl in pain. Faun continued the motion with a hard shove left tugging on the wound causing the laguz to fall left of Elfriede overboard. A disgusting sound is heard as his rapier “unsheathes itself from the laguz arm” as he falls.

Elfriede had cleared some of the plank and desperately wanted to take a breather, but a fireball came sizzling passed him and landed on the deck behind him. Elfriede grimaced and looked up at the mage who had thrown the incandescent ball of energy who was preparing to throw yet another. *Afina hasn’t been able to do anything yet.* He started to worry, but quickly cleared his mind. He didn't need the distractions. Another fireball came whizzing towards him so Elfriede, now paying attention to the mage, dove backwards to avoid it. The fireball sizzled and exploded onto the plank setting it ablaze.

Before he could count his blessings, Elfriede had rolled right into a laguz female with an axe who has been coming to flank him. They both toppled over with Elfriede landing squarely on his back, while the pirate landed in a sitting position next to him. She quickly tried to take advantage of her superior position and swung downward at Elfriede. A loud clang resounded as the boy caught the axe just centimeters from his face with a cross of his rapier and dagger. 

“Thank the good lady…” he caught himself saying.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

“Hey!” Afina yelled indignantly, watching as a fireball sizzled past Elfriede and struck the floorboards behind him. Thankfully, the ship did not catch ablaze, instead letting the fire fizzle out to mere embers. “Who gave you filthy animals the right--!?” 

Though the mages were unable to hear her about the din of battle, a few nudged each other, pointing and snickering at the princess that stood upon the highest point of the Aster. Afina stomped her foot indignantly. _They aren’t taking me seriously_, she thought angrily, until another idea struck her. _So they don’t know that I’m the light mage. Idiots._

Afina opened her book, eyes glancing between the runes on the page and the band of fire mages on the other ship. A familiar white halo appeared on the floor beneath the mages, and suddenly the mages ceased laughing. Each scrambled to get out of the encirclement, horrified expressions on their faces. “Stinkin’ Eraian!” one of them hollered, and Afina’s glare intensified. _She was wearing Laeran Blue for king’s sake!_

A beam of light shot up from the ground where a circle had been moments before, and the mages gaped in horror as one of their companions was entirely swallowed up. As the light faded, two knelt down to assist their clearly-incapacitated ally, while the other two fixed their gaze on Afina. _Well, at least they’re taking me seriously now_, Afina thought, a self-satisfied expression playing across her face. 

A sudden, anger-fueled fireball then shot towards Afina, and she ducked behind a pile of crates to evade it. _How could she retaliate against two mages?_ Afina thought, eyes searching the ship for any form of assistance. None of the pirates in particular carried a shield of some sorts, which would have been the best aid in such a situation. The Laeran’s eyes lit up as she remembered how the fireballs had not set the ship ablaze. _They must be covered in some form of fire retardant_, she reasoned. 

Spotting a circular piece of wood in the deck, Afina crawled across the deck and unsheathed her sword, to wedge it between the floorboards, all the while hoping Elfriede would not glance up to see her blatant misuse of weaponry.  The floorboards creaked as she tried to pry up the piece of wood, struggling against the tightly fastened flooring. While she wasn’t particularly strong, Afina hoped that at least her weight would free the would-be shield.

With a crack, half the wood panelling came up from the ground, and Afina bit her lip. She would elect not to tell the captain about this one later, instead turning the half-circle shield towards her enemy mages. The wood was thick, and difficult to hold, but could surely provide ample defense against the fireballs. _Hm, fireballs_, Afina thought. _These mages don’t know any other fire spells?_

Afina peered her face from behind the heavy makeshift shield, trying to line up her sights for another light spell. The mages weren’t stupid enough to fall for the coalescing spell again, but perhaps a spontaneous ball of light would do the trick.

The sailors of the Aster are held in check by the mast-men running amuck about the ship. The best the men can do is keep the Kouneli from getting below deck where they could do more damage. Neither the captain of the Aster or the enemy ship is easy to spot. 

(ooc: You guys are doing a good job with the mooks on your own, continue writing your battles as you see fit. 👌)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-19*

Elfriede winced as he knew what this would come to. He jerked his weapons downwards while fighting against the force of the women above him. The weapons slid down the hilt to where the handle was made of wood. Elfriede’s razor sharp blades bit through it and he finished the motion of the cross, double slashing the females throat above him. He dodged the falling axe head as blood poured out of her new wound onto him. She reached up for her throat and Elfriede tore free and kicked her off. He looked at her with remorse, he always hated when it came to this. Best not to let her suffer. Faun leaned forward and stabbed her quickly into her chest through the vital.

“May Lylalel guide you.” 

He had no time to wallow over yet another life, there were far too many enemies for that. Elfriede stood up quickly and glanced over to the plank he was just on, which was now aflame. He looked right through a small group of four pirates to see that they were still coming over the one plank unchallenged. 

“I better challenge them I suppose.” He said to himself before he sprinted off towards the group. *There were too many… he’d be hard pressed to beat them back without a few deaths… He’d have to…*

Faun approached one from behind with a hard thrust through the chest. *Three.* He high kicked the pirate into another and yanked his rapier out. As they all turned Faun approached a lagu male to his left, dropped, and swept their legs out with his right leg. His dagger came up into the back of the pirates neck as he fell. *Two* 

Elfriede felt like he was running out of breath and his arms felt numb from the clashing of weapons, but he couldn’t let up. One of the pirates came at his low form with a shield and mace in retaliation. He rolled right as the mace came down hard, hitting the wall of the ship with the bottom of his boots. He pushed off the wall hard and the wall creaked loudly in response. Faun hit the pirate shoulder first and checked the swinging pirate over the side of the railing. *One* He stood back up as again a young male stared at him holding a dagger shaking while frowning in disbelieve. He came at Elfriede in random swings, this kid was a mess. Faun knocked the boy’s dagger out of his hand into the waters below and moved forward.

“Enough.” Faun brought his knee up hard in the gut knocking the wind out of the boy. “This isn't how you get your way Kouneli.” He truly felt sorry for the boy, clearly carried astray by the radical beliefs of these pirates. Faun glanced over to a nearby closet, knocked the boy unconscious with a blow to the back of the head and threw him in there. He’d deal with that one later. 

Several more pirates came over the plank. Faun shut the closet door and winced when he noticed. “I’ve wasted to much time already.” He moved towards the plank to reenter the fray.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-21*

A sudden fireball blasted against Afina’s makeshift shield, and she was thrown backwards. The princess landed on her back with a _thunk_, the heavy wood hitting her chest and knocking the wind out of her. Afina coughed, pushing the shield off of her and sitting up. _Fine,_ Afina thought, still coughing as she crouched behind the railing of the ship. _I’ll deal with you mages later_. After all, the fireproof nature of the ship’s wood would hold them at bay for at least a little while. If they started to target the sails or cargo, there would be issues. But Afina had to assist the sailors on the Aster before she could make any more headway with the enemy mages. There was simply too much going on to target them effectively. 

Afina hurried down the stairs to the main platform, clutching her book tightly in her arms. Her sword bounced in its sheath at her side, ready to be drawn should she need it. An enemy pirate moved to challenge Afina as she descended from the upper deck, catching her halfway down the stairs. 

As he raised his sword towards her, Afina caught him in the eyes with flash of light, and the pirate dropped his weapon. The laguz fighter growled, tears welling in his blinded eyes as he fumbled to grab Afina. The princess shrieked, batting at the Kouneli’s arms with her book. The furious laguz grasped the heavy leather spellbook, and Afina yanked back, the two engaged in a tugging match. A sudden thought struck Afina. The laguz was still recovering from her spell; his balance was vastly uncoordinated. If she could just...

Afina gave one last pull at the book, before letting go entirely, and kicking her foot forward. As if on cue, the laguz man pulled back, and was shocked to meet no resistance as Afina let go. He wobbled on the edge of the steps, and the force of Afina’s kick send him tumbling down. Afina trailed behind him, gracefully descending the rest of the stairs before stooping over to pick up her book.  _Stupid laguz_, she thought, stepping around the rabbit laguz’s unconscious body. 

Facing the battle, Afina had not registered the awkward angle that the pirate’s neck was contorted at, his unseeing eyes dimly pointed skyward. She had eliminated a threat, that was all. To what extent, however, she was not yet aware of. 

Afina froze as she finally spotted Elfriede, the Eraian knight leaned forward to stab a laguz woman in the chest. The princess’ breath caught in her throat as the woman slumped over, and Elfriede gently laid her back on the floor. Afina studied his face; _May Lylalel guide you_, he mouthed, hesitating only for a moment before returning to the fray. Her stomach churned and her face grew pale as her gaze froze on the woman’s body, abruptly turning away when she felt she had seen too much. _The front lines was no place for a princess_, she thought, turning her face towards the rest of the fighters on the main deck.

Blood spattered across the floorboards in all directions, smudged and smeared where men had continued their skirmish from the ground. An Eraian sailor hit the deck a few paces ahead of her, and Afina grasped her book tighter, knuckles turning white. In an instant the pirate’s assailant was engulfed in a purifying beam of light that seemed to materialize from the very sky itself. The laguz soon joined his recent kill on the deck of the Aster. Remembering Elfriede’s actions of not moments before, Afina lowered her book, anxiously thumbing the pin that bore her family’s sigil. “May Lylalel guide you,” she whispered, hoping that, despite her own lack of faith, her gesture may help the sailor in whatever way it can.  

Afina realigned her sights to the enemy mages once more, secretly hoping to engage in a much… cleaner form of combat than swordfighting. The princess was not one in particular for spilling blood. Perhaps this very fact was why the Laeran favored light magic above all.

With Afina retreating in their eyes, the sabatours return their attention to the masts of the Astor. The wind greatly interferes with launching the fireballs at them at first, but like a long range archer they slowly compensate for the wind after each shot and bring their fireballs closer to the cloth masts. 

(ooc: Keep on keeping on. The masts now have hit points, as if they were an ally character. They follow the same rules as any other ally; they take one damage a turn (until the sabatours are defeated particularly, in this case). They will not earn dice (they're masts, for christ's sake) but if you take actions to defend them, you can roll defense dice 'for' the masts.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-22*

Faun dove into a double-cross low at the two pirates just getting off the plank. Both took solid hits to the legs, knocking them on their chests in pain. Elfriede, feeling determined once more, got his second wind. He sprinted halfway across the plank and met several laguz head on. The first in the group stabbed in at him. Faun brought his dagger up, locked its hilt with the sword and with a twist pointed the stab outward to the left. His rapiers tip came down fast into the shin of the unfortunate pirate. He Jerked his left hand outward pulling the pirate overboard in one fluid motion. 

As the pirate fell he grabbed at Faun getting a slight hold on his ankle before falling. Even though it was only a brief grappling, it knocked him off balance as the next pirate came down hard with a mace. Faun started to dodge right by tilting his body, but the mace still came down hard on his left shoulder. The glancing blow made his arm go numb. A moment later there was a splash in the water caused by the knight Lieutenant's lost dagger. Elfriede winced at his arm and even teared up a bit at the shooting pain. The mace came across again as the pirate was looking to end it, but was met with the steel of Elfriede’s tough rapier. 

Faun ducked and pushed the mace up high, following it up with a stab through the chest. In one fluid motion he yanked his sword free and side-kicked the pirate backwards into the two behind them. One of them lost footing and fell off right then, while the other fell on their back. He ran over top of the two prone bodies taking special care to stomp **hard** on the downed *and still alive* pirates chest. He jumped off the plank and landed on the deck of the pirates stolen ship. His arm throbbed in pain, feeling had not started to return to the limb yet, for it hung loosely at his left.

The two remaining mages where already eyeing him as the most immediate threat and began throwing fireballs his way. Elfriede dodged left and right while running for the stairs to get to the mages floor. Another sword wielding pirate rounded the corner and engaged him. Elfriede ducked and side stepped thier two swings respectively and countered with one of his own… which landed once again through the chest. Wasting no time he ran up the wooden stairs only to be blocked at the top by a curtain of fire. Elfriede clicked his tongue and ran back down and desperately began glancing around. **This needed to end.**

He looked back to the Aster thought of all the innocent folk being killed with each passing second and his blood boiled. At least Afina was still alive, he thought to himself as he constantly had the reassurance of beams and balls of light going off all around the battlefield. “Where is the one calling the shots of this disgrace of a ship.” He growled through gritted teeth. He saw a door that clearly went into a room on the ship, which he went over to. *Better than nothing...* He thought as he opened the door and entered.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

Once she had acquired a tactically-favorable position away from the fighting, Afina took a deep breath, clearing her mind of the gore and violence that seemed to be occuring around her. _If I could just take out the mages, this fight could be over_, she thought, glancing between her spellbook and the enemy mages. Some of them still stood, having deemed that their fallen comrade was still alive. They knew her best trick by now; Afina would have to be creative to catch them off guard. The swinging sails of the enemy ship caught the Laeran’s eye. _Perfect_. 

The princess withdrew a piece of paper hidden among the folds of her dress, crouching behind a stack of crates to provide her own cover. As she began to read, a small fireball formed in her hand, no larger than a marble. The small fireball shot forward, severing the bonds of a single rope that held the sail in place, causing the bright white sails to dip down ever so slightly. _Why bother trying to destroy the sails when one could just down them instead?_ Afina thought, the steadfast ropes snapping one by one. The mages themselves were too occupied with targeting the Aster’s mast and sails to notice that their own was being dismantled piece by piece.

As the last rope snapped, Afina’s page smoldered into nothingness, and she released it as she quickly switched to her light spellbook. An incandescent ball of light blinded the mages, as the sail came crashing down upon their heads. The Kouneli scrambled underneath the sheet, only one managing to escape from underneath the fallen sail. The quintessential halo formed on the ground beneath the mages’ feet, and in a moment, the rabbit laguz were enveloped in a purifying beam of light. Their bodies collapsed beneath the sails, unconscious. 

Afina watched as the lone mage scrambled away, conjuring a wall of fire to keep out… Elfriede? Afina squinted, leaning over the rail of the ship. _Why was Elfriede on the enemy ship?_ The knight was doing well enough; he defeated every enemy pirate that challenged him. Afina hurried down the stairs of the Aster. She would have to board the enemy ship as well to defeat the last mage, who hid behind walls of fire. _Dumb coward_, she thought, approaching the gangplank. The princess hesitated, glancing back at the fighting that seemed to be winding down on the Aster. _They’ll survive, eliminating the mage is my duty_, she thought, crossing to the enemy ship.

As Elfriede disappeared through a door in the ship, Afina turned to the enemy fire mage. The Kouneli woman snickered, and Afina spotted that the fire mage lacked a front tooth. _Gross_. “Having second thoughts now that your knight is gone, Eraian girl?” the pirate asked, the fire walls that had burned brightly only moments before having petered out. 

Afina straightened her back. “I'm a Laeran, if that stands to make a difference to the likes of you,” the princess stated, as if the fact was painfully obvious. 

The pirate woman’s cocky smirk dropped, thoroughly unamused with Afina. “I see…” she said, hands lingering towards her tattered stack of papers. _Was THAT her spell book_, Afina thought. Whoever these pirates were, they weren't very bountiful if they couldn't afford a simple spellbook.

In her moment of distraction, Afina just narrowly dodged a fireball sent spiraling towards her. The inferno grazed the princess’ right arm, and Afina could feel the scorching burn. The kouneli woman laughed, shooting another fireball soon after. This time, however, Afina reacted quickly with a light ball of her own. The two magics collided in midair, and the light faded out as the fireball fizzled into the ground. 

There, the two women stood, sizing each other up for combat. Afina gripped her wounded arm, her spell book wedged up against her chest. She was determined not to lose this fight.

Elfriede's charge to the under deck is cut off as a tall man comes stepping through, his rabbit ears pressed against the low below deck ceilings. He has scruffy brown hair that covers his human ears and brushed his broad shoulders. While not a muscular build he's solid and you can tell he's an accomplished fighter simply by the way he moves. He has brown stubble on  his surprisingly young face, Elfriede can spot guess his age at upper 20's lower 30's. The man has three daggers on his left side, and a scimitar on his right. He has scars up his right arm, old and deep. He wears a short sleeve white shirt with a leather vest over top, worn open. 

The man quickly scans the downed rear mast of his own ship and the state of the battle on the Aster. He also looks at Afina and Elfriede upon his own ship.

"All hands, hit the burrow!" He shouts, his voice echoing across the water. At once every pirate on the Aster transforms and leaps backwards, using their rabbit traits to reach the gangplanks in a single leap. They cover each other as they begin returning to their own ship. Some of the Aster's crew press them, but most are defensive at best and are willing to let the Kouneli retreat. Kouneli pound across the gangplanks, making crossing them back to the Aster quite difficult.

The man transforms himself, his laguz form somehow more burly than that of his crew's. He bounds onto Elfriede, the weight from his forepaws on the knight-lieutenant's shoulders forcing the knight flat on his back. He leaps off him, oddly enough not driving his hind legs into Elfriede's prone form, instead kicking off the deck. The Kouneli spins around as he lands, interposing himself between Elfriede and the way he came. 

(ooc: Goals have changed now that the pirates are in full retreat: Each of you needs 4 dice successes to escape the ship, in whatever manner you can come up with to do so. If one of you escapes and the other does not, I will be fine with allowing the escaper to forfeit that escape to stay with the other. The ONLY thing that needs to happen to escape is clearing the goal for escape; Haldel does not need to be beaten. You'll only have one round to make your escapes.)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-28*

As Elfriede opens the door, he is met face to face with *whomst* was clearly the captain. He looked on the young side, yet seemed experienced. Faun stumbles backward gripping his rapier hard with his still functioning arm. Feeling had just started to return to his left hand as he felt tingling at his fingertips. Just as Faun began to ready himself the rabbit captain made a call out to his troops, swiftly followed by a pounce that Elfriede hadn't expected. The Kouneli form was larger than the average, which the knight lieutenant did not compensate for, and he toppled over onto his back with a thud.


Pain throbbed in Elfriede’s useless arm and caused him to yelp. When he realized that the captain had not injured him further and he was confused. Soon after, Faun heard the rumbling of many Laguz feet. *He Issued a retreat!* Faun shot up and looked to his right, the path being guarded by the captain and soon to be blocked by many pirates. He needed to leave **fast**. He shuffled to his feet and just as he was about to confront the Laguz swarm he saw blonde hair on the upper deck... which of course caught his eye. *Afina is aboard.* The sight of her gave him hope for the fight and the possibility of escaping. However, he now feared for her life as well. 

Faun waved at her and swiftly pointed to the Aster, signaling their return. He sighed heavily at the danger that lay directly before them and readied himself again. He started forward joining Afina heading for the gangplank. The captain growled at them in response. Elfriede started off in a sprint and the captain pounced likewise. Instead of engaging he dodged, he was merely distracting him.

Afina follow him closely towards their only exit. Then came the forces crossing the gang plank, on at a time they poured over and Faun started engaging each one doing damage to each that started to step forward. He was running out of breath, panting heavily, and only had one weapon to fight with. His offence was the same but he lacked his defense. One by one the pirates transformed back drawing their swords *They were running out of time.* Faun dove into the crowd blocking the way, swinging and stabbing wildly at them while deftly evading. He tagged one in the chest, one the throat and several in the legs. He felt himself slowing down, getting sluggish. At least the way was looking clear. Several of the pirates stepped back fearing the glistening rapier soaked in blood. Only one more *experienced looking* one blocked his way.

The laguz man smirked at him and came at him with two swords. This one was clearly a veteran pirate. The man engaged him swinging fast left and right. Sweat poured down his brow. Faun could not keep up the evasive maneuvers. In a reckless last ditch effort he threw himself forward after a clean dodge and stabbed upward hard, impaling the unlucky laguz through the stomach. Just as Faun thought he had won the rabbits arm swung upwards with sword poised tip forwards. Which found its way deep into Elfriede's abdomen. In a panic Faun kicked the man off. His sword slid out with him and Faun’s stomach erupted into a fountain of blood. It was so sudden Faun hardly felt it, but as he stared down at it he couldn’t mistake the sight of his own lifeblood pouring out of his stomach. 

He dropped his weapon and his eyes widened. His breath picked up and his heart rate climbed. Faun’s hands shook and his gaze slowly drifted up and met Afina’s stare. “I’m sorry.”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

In one fluid motion, Afina conjured another spell, and the upper deck was encased in a flash of white. The fire mage growled as she squeezed her eyes shut, targeting impaired without the use of sight. The laguz woman shot off another fireball in a haphazard direction as the light dimmed, and there was a dull _oof_ as it struck its intended target. The princess had been struck in the abdomen, and tumbled backwards, finally striking the rails that separated the upper deck from the lower deck. 

The fire mage hollered triumphantly. “Damn Eraians, aren’t so tough now, hm!?” she laughed, and Afina unsteadily got back to her feet. _Gross_, Afina thought, fixated on the gap where the laguz’s front tooth should have been. 

“Cease these attacks, and you will be tried with fairness and justice in the eyes of _Laeran_ law,” Afina declared, emphasizing her heritage in the hopes that the laguz would _finally_ understand her. “I do not wish for violence.”

“And yet you board OUR boat?” the laguz asks incredulously, eyes wide, hands thrown out to the sides. Afina’s eyes darted to the pages that the mage still clasped in her hands, now far away from her face. 

Afina squinted at the mage. “You boarded us _first_, you idiot!” Afina yelled, growing frustrated with the Kouneli’s ignorance. Her book held in her left hand, Afina charged towards the rabbit woman, right hand unsheathing her sword. The light caught the blue inlays of the blade, and in an instant, Afina felt invigorated with the thought of her kingdom. She sliced upwards at the woman’s outstretched hand. 

Though her immediate reaction was to look away, Afina forced herself to watch as the blade bit through the rabbit laguz’s fingers, and sanguine blood flowed freely from the wound. The woman clutched her wounded hand to her chest, and Afina bit back her horror as red blossomed across the pirate’s stained, white t-shirt. Tears welled in the pirate’s eyes, and suddenly Afina had to urge to run away. This violence she had inflicted… Afina wanted it gone. The fire mage opened her mouth to yell at the princess, but was engulfed in a purifying beam of light, collapsing on the floor in a muddled heap. 

Afina sheathed her sword, abruptly turning away from the unconscious mage, who would now lack two fingers for the rest of her life because of Afina. The princess wished she couldn’t dwell on it, but the imagery was still too fresh in her mind. A sudden thunk made Afina turn abruptly, running to the railing to see to the lower deck. _Elfriede!_

The Eraian knight had hit the deck with a dull _thunk_, while some… beast stood over him. _A rabbit laguz? He was going after the captain!_ Afina realized, readying her book to begin casting once again. Now that she had defeated the mages, she was ready to assist Elfriede in conquering the captain. Only then might they be able to leave.

Afina quickly conjured a light shield between Elfriede and the captain to give the knight a chance to stand once more. He had really taken a beating during this fight; he clutched his rapier in his right hand, but his left seemed utterly useless. _Had he been pushing himself too hard? Why wasn’t the captain attacking him?_ Afina’s shield was effective, but there was nothing to stop the laguz leader from ordering his men to assault Elfriede. And, frankly, if he did, there was little chance that Elfriede could resist, in his condition. The laguz, even those on the Aster, began to retreat back to the main ship. _Retreat!?_

By then, Elfriede had gotten to his feet, and begun to wave Afina over. She nodded as he pointed to the Aster. They had to retreat as well, or risk being taken prisoner by the laguz. Afina hurried down the steps of the upper deck, joining Elfriede on the lower. _This is the closest we’ve been all fight_, Afina noticed. The knight surely liked to make a habit of running off in combat. His injuries showed how overzealous he had become.

Elfriede charged at the captain, and Afina shot him a confused look. “There’s no time to engage!” she yelled, before seeing the Eraian dodge the captain’s advances.  The captain blundered past the two of them, turning around in confusion. _That had been a diversionary tactic. Smart, Elfriede_, she thought, finally reaching her escort. As he pushed the offensive towards the gangplanks, Afina hid behind him, keeping one hand on his shoulder, with the cool, smooth metal of his armor reminding her that he was present while she fired off miscellaneous light spells. 

Afina noticed Elfriede’s ragged breathing, and his slowed movements. It was possible they might not make it to the gangplank in time. And should that happen… 

The princess gasped as she no longer felt the cold armor beneath her hand. “Elfriede?” she said, glancing about. More laguz swarmed towards her, and an angry beam of light eliminated them. “Elfriede!” she repeated, as the laguz pirates had seemed to halt their assault on her. Now they gawked, a small half circle opening up not a few feet from the gangplank. Elfriede? “MOVE!” Afina commanded, a crackling ball of light eliminating the throng of pirates. It abruptly extinguished itself as Afina came to the forefront of what had occured. The princess was overwhelmed by the sight in front of her, and had to register each component one at a time.

There was a burly laguz pirate collapsed on the ground. Covered in blood. Two standards swords laid on the ground, one clean, while the other was coated in blood. Elfriede’s own rapier had been discarded, equally sheen with blood. And there was Elfriede, wide-eyed, his hands grasping at his stomach. Covered in blood. His amber eyes met the gray-blue of Afina’s, and a knot formed in her stomach. He looked scared. Elfriede, the confident Eraian knight, looked terrified. “I’m sorry.”

Afina’s feet moved before she had developed a cohesive plan. _Elfriede is hurt, have to get Elfriede._ Afina slipped herself underneath Elfriede’s arm, one hand pressed against his back to try to help steady him. He was liable to collapse any minute. _Blood. Fix the blood._ The princess glanced between her only free hand, which held her spellbook, and back to Elfriede. His shaking hands were doing their best to stem the flow of blood. Afina could feel his breath, quick and warm against her arm as he began to slump over. _Get out, Afina_. The princess glanced in every direction, but her vision seemed muddled with pirates and their angry, dirty faces wherever she looked. Her eyes went down to her spellbook once more, its pages propped open to that _dumb_ detonation spell that she hadn’t managed to grasp yet. _It’s now or never._

The Captain watches Elfriede being run through with a stoic expression. He turns around as the knight-lieutenant hits the deck and begins ordering the returned pirates about the ship. They release their main mast and the ship starts to separate from the Aster, the gangplanks will fall into the drink in no more than a minute's time. Cheers echo from the Aster, celebrating their victory. A few crewman manage to notice their downed guests on the other end of the gangplanks, though none are brave enough to risking running across the gangplank to them. There's time for one trip across, not a trip there and back. 

(ooc: Technically Elfriede has lost and I get to narrate a suitable defeat for him. He did that to himself though, so I'mma skip it. Afina's extra escape successes bled over into Elfriede's, both are able to escape in this round. By escaping you've cleared the conflict as well, so narrate your success.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-29*

In an instant, the pirate ship was engulfed in a brilliant white light. Like a shockwave, it burst outwards, with Afina and Elfriede at its center. The air whipped around the mage and the knight from the sudden detonation, and Afina held on tighter to Elfriede as she gawked at the spell that surrounded them. They stood at the peaceful eye of the storm, with hollering pirates on every side. 

Afina stood up straighter as the light faded and she was left standing amongst the fallen pirates with Elfriede. Some had collapsed, while others lay in fetal position, and still more were doubled over in pain. A bright light glinted in the corner of her eye, and Afina swiftly bent over to grab Elfriede’s rapier. “Alright, now we must go,” she said, to direct Elfriede as well as herself. He seemed to manage a nod in response, and she tried not to notice how pale he was getting. 

They started for the gangplank, which seemed dangerously close to separating from the two boats entirely. Afina pushed Elfriede in front of her, before turning to face the enemy ship once more so that she could ensure no one pursued them. “Seize her!” the captain hollered from his position on one knee.

“Do not!” Afina yelled, pointing Elfriede’s rapier at the enemy pirates. The remaining laguz hesitated, and Afina carefully began to backup along the gangplank. Halfway across with no indication of pursuers, Afina lowered the weapon, and returned to ushering Elfriede across. Shoving her book underneath her arm, Afina helped to support Elfriede as best she could, even as the adrenaline subsided from her body and fatigue began to set in. 

Their boots hit the deck with a _thunk_ just as the gangplank began to slide off its ledge. Afina’s own knees were weak, but she put on a brave face as she turned to the crew. “Can I get some assistance?” she asked, cocking an eyebrow. The crew jumped to assist the fallen knight, and Afina followed close at their heels as they half-carried, half-dragged Elfriede to his bunk. 

Afina’s mind was running through the options. She didn’t know healing magic, so any assistance was beyond her capability. _Well, perhaps except for sewing_, she thought to herself, desperately hoping that the situation did not degrade _that_ poorly. “Is there a healing mage on this ship?” Afina asked one of the crewmen. He nodded slowly, unsurely. Afina scowled. “Okay, then let me do your job, go get the mage!” Afina said, shoving aside the sailor to return to assisting Elfriede. 

The princess struggled for words. Her first inkling was to ask if Elfriede was alright, which clearly he was not. Perhaps there was something inspiring to be said. He _had_ fought well after all, if it a bit too boldly. Afina remembered how he looked when they had locked eyes on the ship. “You’ll be alright,” she said quietly, leaning over to address him directly.

One of the sailors opened the door to Elfriede’s bunk and laid the knight down. Afina stepped aside as the medical mage entered, and immediately turned his attention to Elfriede. _He was stable now_, she thought, collapsing into the desk chair near the bed. Her forearm throbbed with pain where the fireball had glanced off of it, and scorch marks and ash peppered her dress, while dark soot stained her bright hair. Blood was caked on the underside of her boots, and the seams she had repaired in her dress from the last fight had begun to tear. Blood spattered her cloak where she had assisted Elfriede, and the princess gingerly removed the garment, folding her arms across her chest.

The clank of metal hitting the floor snapped Afina back to attention. They had removed Elfriede’s armor, and were undoing his jacket. The medical mage produced a pair of scissors, and they began to cut away at his undershirt. Alarmed, Afina wondered if she should exit the room. Luckily, however, that was the full level of undressing they did on Elfriede, and Afina breathed a sigh of relief. She leaned back in her chair, legs and arms crossed. _Finally, everything was taken care of_, she thought, eyes closing. If she herself could just relax a couple minutes…

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-29*

The world around him began to revolve. Afina suddenly embraced and supported him. He clutched his wound hopelessly as they were slowly surrounded by the remaining pirates. Faun’s legs felt weak under him. The situation seems so incredibly hopeless. He was to die here... failing in his duty and Afina would be captured. Despite everything he did during this fight to save them and the Aster… it seemed to not matter.

Suddenly a bright light swirled about them everywhere he looked. He had never seen anything like it. A small flicker of hope kept him standing against a blackout of consciousness. Intense nausea fell over him with every… *step?*. *They were walking across to the Aster? When had that happened?* He didn't fully grasp everything around him, but he knew he owed the princess a great debt. With his head angled downward, he saw blood pour out of his stomach with every step. He had no idea how he was still standing. *Is someone supporting me?* 

Once he touch down on the ship, the next few moments he was barely conscious. He remembered be carried, then being in a bed. Afina shouting about a mage and... then… *Afina staring up at him smilingly lightly.* “*You’ll be alright.*” Even in his barely conscious stupor Elfriede felt the weight behind her words. Her tired eyes open wide with an intense concerned stare. Her smile was forced. He wanted to thank her but he couldn't find the strength to even speak.

She was completely covered in blood on one side of her body, which Faun was able to discern was his own. *Look at how repulsive I am, bleeding all over the women I was supposed to be protecting.* Thinking about how pathetic he was in this moment he wanted to cry, but again the world swirled black and he drifted into unconsciousness. He faintly heard shuffling through the blackness as people worked on his wound. In the next hour, in what felt like a deep sleep, he dreamed of himself drowning. But in the moment just before he was going to run out of breath, a hand plunged into in the water and dragged him above it. He felt embarrassed, but at peace. *“Thank you.”*

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

Thankfully, the rest of your trip to Lyall is uneventful. The medical staff of the ship aren't equipped with the level of magecraft required to truly heal Elfriede but they easily stabilize him over the remaining week at sea. The crew gives your group a wide birth; your deeds in the fight are talked about in whispers. 

As you go to step off the docked ship, the Captain looks to you. He simple nods and utters a "Thanks" in the same simple, focused way as always. Then he turns back to his business with the same gusto you've seen him with all trip. 

Lyall is a massive city. Even from the bay you couldn't see the far end of it. The most prominent thing on the Lyall skyline is a massive lighthouse, set a few blocks in from the coast. Afina actually saw it from the boat the day before, but none of the crew pointed it out as anything less than a star in the night sky. The tower is black marble, and at least as tall as Laera's castle towers. It's light is warm and inviting, despite the deep shadows of the black stone.

Lyall is in fact, made more of black marble than not. It's a city in the grandest form, multi story buildings in every direction. Second to the black stone is stained glass, almost every building you can see has large windows of stained glass which colored light pours from. Purple and bright white highlights adorn the city in a strange mix of colors, with warm orange light mixing to keep the place from looking like a painter's nightmare. Lyall's streets are wide and allow the light to play on the cobblestone. 

You come off the ship to a busy port, given the Aster is a cargo ship you disembarked on a shipping pier rather than a commuter pier. From where you are, you'll have to head west along the water before turning north west up towards Faun Manor. It's not a short walk.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-04*

The next few days aboard went slowly for Elfriede. Being on a boat with no activity was bad enough, but being bedridden long enough to think about your mistakes is another. The only activity he had during his time was reading and his daily chats with Afina when she brought him his breakfast and supper. Some conversations were fun and enlightening while others were a bit awkward with them trying to avoid the combat incident topic. 

On the final morning Afina helped support him while he attempted to walk again. There was some intense tightness in his stomach, but he finally managed to walk on his own. He definitely wouldn't be fighting or traveling for several days at least.
---
When they arrived at port Afina had left the boat ahead of him, semi-eager to get off and look at the city. He had changed into civilian clothes and was no less eager. He’d had enough of this boat to last a year at least. After he said farewell to the captain and was about to step down the boarding plank, his upper arm was lightly tapped by an excited sailor. 

He leaned in and spoke with respect. “Thank you for all that you both ‘ave done. Who knows where we’d be without you two.” he paused for a moment. “That girlfriend of yours really gave this one pirate hell. I saw it! Hit ‘em with ‘er book and knocked him right dead she did. That’s a tough one you got there! Best not to let ‘er go.”

Elfriede nodded to him and smiled as the man went back to his duties. He wasn’t about to get up in arms over a misunderstanding. Besides… *Afina…* **killed** someone? That doesn’t sound right… Maybe… *Could it be she doesn’t know?*
Elfriede thought it best to keep it to himself even if she *did* know. She probably didn't want to be reminded. He shook his head and walked down to join her.

Afina, in high spirits, locked arms with him and suddenly pointed to the lighthouse asking him “*what it was for?*” with stars in her eyes. 

“Ah, believe it or not, it’s a military building. Odd I know… the few foreigners we get visiting here always find that a bit strange. They have meetings there of high importance at times, while the bottom floor is a museum of sorts! I’ve never been to the upper floors, but it is a beautiful sight and a sort of... symbol to us.” 

He smiled hoping the short description answered her question, and brought them over to the harbormaster area.There he paid a messenger service to deliver his rapier and armour to his home. He also sent them with a message that he’d return later with company. The two then proceeded to the bathing house which was much grander than the previous towns. Elfriede bathed, being careful of his wound, which was closed, but far from fully healed. 
---
After bathing, he had switched to civilian clothes and walked slowly as to not hurt himself more. Once Afina returned, he nodded to her once she came over. “I’d say we’ll spend a bit of time with me showing you around wouldn't you agree?”

*He was interrupted by his own growling stomach.* He broke eye contact a bit embarrassed. 
“A-ah but perhaps we should get something to eat first? Just thinking of anything other then the food we had at sea… I could do without that food for a year or two.”
---
After dining, Elfriede secured them a horse driven carraige to be taken around the city to various locations before finally settling at his family house in the afternoon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Afina spent much of her days about the ship studying and reading. It was nice and peaceful on ship, the perfect place to study. She had read over her light magic and fire magic instructions at least a thousand times each, and spent the days practicing her magic on deck. The sailors didn’t bat an eyelash; After the events of the battle, no one seemed to question the princess’ practice sessions. 

During the night, Afina occupied much of her time with talking to Elfriede. They exchanged stories of their childhood, and of cultural norms in their respective countries. Sometimes they joked, but often they simply skirted around the topic of the pirate invasion that had occurred days prior. The morning of their arrival in Lyall, Afina helped to get Elfriede back on his feet once more. The knight was unsteady, but managing. _There goes being a protector, hmm_, Afina thought.
---
As the boat dropped its anchor at the port, Afina was the first to leave the boat. She had seen the most astounding architecture from the ship. Black marble and stained glass shimmered in the sunlight, towers and spires reaching high into the sky. Afina gawked at such marvelous structures, their design so different from that of Laera. The coastal breeze tousled Afina’s hair, and made the blue chiffon of her dress flutter in the breeze as she took in the view of the city from the docks.

Most of all, it was the lighthouse that caught Afina’s attention. “Elfriede, can we-,” she started, turning around, only to realize that the knight lieutenant was several paces behind her, still on the ship. “Elfriede, are you coming?” she called, waving her hand. Elfriede smiled, dismissing a sailor that must have been saying his final “thanks” for their help in battle. It seemed like every crewman had wanted to say thanks at one time or another. Whether it had been spoken, or expressed through a kind gesture, the sailors did not seem to want to admit it, but the travelling nobles had proved to be essential to defending the ship against the pirates. 

Elfriede nodded, making his way down the gangplank. Afina locked arms with him in the typical escort fashion, her free hand pointing to the lighthouse. “What is that for?” she asked, mesmerized by the array of colors that topped the soaring black marble structure. 

In turn, Elfriede explained that the lighthouse was actually a military installation. “How interesting…” she said slowly, glancing up and down the lighthouse. It looked so beautiful; Afina was glad to hear that at least half of it was for decorative purposes. A museum seemed the most respectable usable. Such a beautiful exterior… Afina was a little disappointed to hear that the military used it. She did no have time to ruminate on such facts, however, as she was quickly ushered to the bath houses. The princess had to admit, she didn’t mind the mandated bathing after so long spent at sea.

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

Lyall is as busy as Theanovene, in someways even more so. Your carriage takes you from the docks area to the residential district in the northwest slowly, due to the congestion. The driver says nothing to you, the only sound the carriage provides is the clatter of the wheels against the cobblestone. 

Faun Manor is in a word, gothic. Fenced in by a high black gate, it's palette is made up of rich, deep brown woods and black accents. From the outside you can tell it has a classic manor structure, with a central hall and two wings. The house faces south, so the west wing is actually in the west as you approach, the east wing likewise in the east. The manor doesn't have alot of open space, at least in the front. While it's enough you need to walk up from the gate, it's no where near the size of other manors in the area. Every windows on the front of the building, from the west wing across to the east, is a stained glass piece. Afina notes that they seem military slanted, as opposed to the many she's seen in the city that praise Lylalel.

Elfriede only has to knock once before the sound of movement *echoes* from the house. The door swings open.

"Yuria?!" the large man bellows. Jorand Faun, clearly Elfriede's father, stands at at least six and a half feet. His black hair is pulled back into a ponytail, though the back of his hair hangs freely below the ponytail. His jawline is square and *powerful*, though softened by his subtle beard. He is dressed in a white shirt, his muscular chest visible at the base of the v shaped collar. He wears black military dress pants, though they seem to be a old pair. He has a pair of tattoos on his right forearm, two purple rings around his sizable forearm. His eyes are a deep blue, and you can't miss the blatent worry in his eyes.

Jorand looks for a moment, glancing at Afina for barely a second before staring at his son. "Elfriede! Elfriede, you're here!" Jorand says, thought the sight of you has not alleviated his worried eyes. He comes in for a light hug. Over his shoulder you can see Aria Faun, looking like she just rain into the great hall from the west wing. 

Aria Faun has light brown hair and sky blue eyes. Her hair is cut in a bob, though it has more volume to it than a typical bob. Her features are weathered, not at all looking like a court lady or anything Afina is familiar with. The only word that seems to apply to the woman is toned. This extends to her frame as well; Aria Faun is not a large woman in frame or in height. This seems to highlight just how well built she is, you can't spot a single place on her torso that isn't muscle. You can see most of her torso as well, The woman is wearing a top only slightly less revealing than a sports bra. She is however also dressed in military slacks and is wearing black boots as well. Judging by the sheathed blade in her hand, she must have been practicing forms. Aria's expression is hard, an expression Elfriede knows better than to ask about. Aria is conflicted about something and wants no one's opinion. 

Jorand releases Elfriede and Aria approaches the door frame. "Welcome home son, rest here in Lylalel's light so you may continue to spread it across her world." she says, giving a small, obligatory hug with the phrase. "You've come at... a fitting time. We have to... to give you the news." She adds, turning on her heel. Jorand nods in agreement. 

"Your guest is welcome as well. Come in and feel her light in this home." Jorand says to Afina. 

- - -

The Faun Manor foyer is in a word, spartan. It's furnished, but it almost seems as if the Fauns have an issue with more than one object on a surface. A foyer is rarely heavily decorated sure, this one seems sparse to Lady Afina. The dining hall you're led to by Aria is similiar, each surface having minimal decorations on it. The large table itself has nothing. Aria sits at the head of the table, Jorand stands to her right. Aria gives Elfriede a look that the Knight learned long ago means 'sit down'. Aria, strangely enough, has yet to even acknowledge Afina's presence. 

"..." Aria goes to speak, but no words come out. Her hands wring together tightly in front of her. Jorand places a hand on her shoulder and it keeps Aria from digging her nails into her skin. 

"Elfriede... Your sister is Missing in Action." Jorand says, pain audible in his voice. "Command has told us no more than that she and her partner" Aria frowns at the mention of the partner, "were sent after a lead on Drecian Wyverns. We have no report of death but... there was a skirmish in her last known location that Drecian forces prevailed in. One soldier reported that the Drecians were out for hostages during the attack." Jorand stops speaking, biting his tongue. 

"She could be oka-" Jorand goes to continue but Aria cuts him off.

"She's as good as KIA." Aria says, her tone icy. Her hands are still clenched and quivering but her eyes are cold and confident. "This is what... what it means to be in a military family." 

"Aria!" Jorand cries. "If there is hope Lylalel will see Yuria through this trial and back to us we must-"

"Jorand, we've had this discussion a dozen times!" Aria barks, standing from her chair and facing her husband. "We have our *reasons* we've never had a captured member of the family! I want my daughter home as much as any mother would, but this is the way things are." Aria looks aside at Elfriede. "I won't sugar coat it for the child I do have."

Jorand glares at his wife, towering over her. She looks back at him and only holds her gaze for a moment before sitting down in the chair she vacated. "We asked if there was any hostage negotiations being opened up, or if a rescue attempt is planned. You know how valuable your sister is to Knight Commander Dynskl." 

"And they refuse to answer us. We've all served in this room; we know that's what the Church does when it doesn't want to give you the bad news directly." Aria spits. "As I said, Yuria is-" and this time Jorand is the one to interrupt.

"Aria! We have some knowledge! I will not write off my daughter as killed in action without at least trying to help her!" Jorand shouts, his voice echoing in the room. The two parents look at each other, conversation being held in their gaze.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

*Elfriede and Afina finally return to his family home in the mid afternoon. He was semi excited to greet his parents for he had a good feeling that they’d really like Afina. They arrive to a hug from his father and a distant glare from his mother. The manor was just as it was when he left: wide opens spaces, simple and relatively large. His father abruptly told them *something happened* and Elfriede looked to his mother confused. They lead them to the dining room and explain what happened to Yuria.*


Elfriede’s eyes go wide at the news and his breathing picks up. He shared his parents pain despite their stoneskin exterior. Aria Faun especially was quick to bury her feelings and lash out at those around her.

“I….I want to go after her!” He says suddenly. “I just… I need to finish what I started. The church mandated that I bring her to Trisp… So I… Please.. Excuse me.” He suddenly gets up and hastily walked back into the main room passing Afina who was waiting just outside the dining hall. Faun leaned against the wall, face in his hands. Tears ran freely as he bit back any sobbing. For a moment, he was alone and cried into his palms.

*She’s in… Dreca? Of course she is. This could have happened at any moment why weren't you ready for it. I want to leave to go to her but… I have to finish my duty, plus I’m injured myself still. But I HAVE to go to her. We don’t even know where she is.* ***If she was brought down then what chance do I really have for saving her…*** *Maybe she’s a hostage, who knows what they are doing with her...*

His mind raced and fumbled hopelessly as he heard the light approaching footsteps. Knowing it was Afina’s footstep from their time traveling together, he quickly wiped his eyes and rounded the corner to approach her. 

“Maybe… we should go talk in my quarters...” he said to her in a defeated breaking voice. He lead her up the stairway in the west to head to his room on the upper floor. Upon entering he walked in first looking away from her. “I’m sorry…. I didn't expect …. *this*…”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

Even from down the hall, Afina could hear the heated exchange between the family members. The princess can hear Elfriede’s parents, their voices gradually growing louder and louder with each response. The only one who seemed not to speak… was Elfriede. Afina bit her lip, hesitantly inching closer to the source of the yelling and pressing her ear to the wall. 

Suddenly, a gruff voice yells “I will not write off my daughter as killed in action without at least trying to help her!”, and Afina tenses up. 

_Daughter… that would be Elfriede’s sister Yuria,_ Afina thought, going through the analysis in her mind. _Elfriede loves his sister, that much is clear. He said he wanted to be as skilled as her someday. But if she’s as good as he says, she’ll be fine, and Elfriede won’t be terribly shaken by such news._ At least, Afina hoped so. 

The sudden scrape of a chair against the floor made Afina jump away from the wall. Inside, she could hear the muffled noise of Elfriede addressing his parents. Afina’s laced her fingers together and squeezed tight, hoping that the knight would be okay.

The door flew open, and Elfriede had already stormed past the princess. For a moment she stared, watching him proceed down the hall. _He seems at least a little jostled_, Afina thought, as he disappeared around a corner. The princess blinked a few times, before hurriedly walking after him.

“Elfriede?” she called, only to nearly bump into him as she rounded the corner. Afina caught his eyes, and quickly realized she had been wrong. Elfriede’s gaze was sorrowful and defeated, and the pink around his eyes gave away just how worried he was for his sister. 

“Maybe… we should go talk in my quarters...” he said, averting her gaze, feebly gesturing towards the staircase. Afina followed close behind Elfriede, unsure what she could do to be a source of comfort. Should she even try? Could Elfriede be pacified so soon after finding out that his sister could very well be dead?

She closed to the door to Elfriede’s bedroom behind them. The knight had his back to her, clearly creating physical _and_ emotional distance between the two of them. Afina didn’t understand it; After two weeks of traveling together, and not a moment spent apart, she would have thought that Elfriede trusted her more.

“I know it’s hard for you,” Afina leaned forward, hoping to catch Elfriede’s eyes once more. “It’s unfair that your parents would put such a stressor on you now, when you’re occupied with your own duties, and thoroughly injured.”

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

Night falls on a quiet Faun household. Dinner is brought to both Elfriede and Afina by one of the three servants in the manor, each carrying the message "The masters are dining privately and wish you a well rest." The servant doesn't comment on the tear stains in either party's eyes. 

- - -

A servant knocks on the door of Elfriede's room as the sun peaks through his window. 

"Master Elfriede? Have you awoken?" The servant (Nath, if Elfriede recalls correctly) enters without hesitation. Nath served the manor when Elfriede was a child and knew the Faun parents were quite strict about a rising early. Nath assumed the habit stuck. 

"The masters would like you and your companion to attend breakfast. Afterwards your Father has called the Priest from Halse District Church to attend to your wounds. If you'd like, I'll redress your bandages before leaving you to dress." Nath says. The man is only a few years older than Elfriede, and wears his five o'clock shadow like a fashion statement. He's a wiry man, barely filling out his uniform. 

Nath was apparently asking rhetorically as he opens his medical case and begins redressing the wound. "My master Elfriede. I had heard you sailed over on a cargo vessel, but I didn't realize the ship had no doctor. These bandages look like they were tied by a blind man." he says, fussing. He's quick with his hands and it's not long before he bows, leaving the room with the soft click of the door.

- - -

Afina is awoken by the soft voice of the female servant of the home, San. Her brown bob reminds you of the lady of the house for a moment, but San is absolute opposite build. San is almost too thin, with little muscle to her. She looks doll like, at least at first glance. The uniform certainly helps with that impression.

"Mi'lady. I have been assigned to wait on you this morning. I know not what you require of you handmaidens so I must ask you, I apologize. The masters request you to join them for breakfast, so that they may properly welcome their guest." San says with a deep curtsy. She is at your beck and call as much as you desire, offering bath, fresh clothes and anything else you could ask for.

San is never impolite, but you do notice a silly looking smile on her face when she thinks you aren't looking. She seems to find something about you enjoyable, though to what there is no clue. 

- - - 

Elfriede enters the hall of the Fauns unescorted, Nath leaving him earlier. Afina is led to the entrance by San, who then curties and leaves. Jorand and Aria are already in the hall, and as each of you enter you are motion to sit. Jorand sits at the head of the table, with Aria to his right. Elfriede's place is across from Aria, and Afina beside him. 

"A belated, if unexcused welcome to our home Afina Tyndall of Laera. Aria says. "It's an honor to have you here with our son." 

"Indeed, greatly so." Jorand says. While Aria's face was expressionless, Jorand's is warmer. "I apologize for being so distracted yesterday, we have a good deal going on in the family, which I'm sure you heard." His face warms into a frown before he sighs deeply.

"Let us put yesterday to rest. Elfriede, Yuria is MIA. There is no beating around that bush. Until we can get any information..." Jorand hesitates. Aria places her hand on Jorand's and squeezes softly. He reciprocates. "We must assume she is KIA. At the least, in terms of our actions. We cannot risk lives on the war front to search aimlessly." He takes a deep breath.

"But we can find out more, and take action. Your mother and I have connections still, and Yuria has friends. Unfortunately her partner has gone missing with her, but there are many other people we can turn to. We will find out anything we can. If we can get enough to go on..." Jorand trails off, a wry expression crossing his face. "Retirement has been rather boring." Aria coughs. 

"And if we can confirm she is in fact KIA... We can honor her properly. You are not to act until we have information that validates taking action, is that understood? I know you care for your sister, but we shall *not* cause trouble for the men and woman on the front lines. As I understand it, your trip here was an oddity from the start. Are you not supposed to be headed to Trisp?" 

"Indeed." Jorand adds. "Would your trip here happen to have to do with this young lady beside you?" he says as the food is brought out around you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-12*

Afina had been awake far before the servant girl peered into the room. The princess had been too upset to sleep particularly well; She welcomed the indication that it was finally time to start the day. 

San introduces herself, and offers to assist the princess in her morning duties. Afina, much accustomed to the ways of her servants back home, asks that San run a bath for her as she begins to undress. Afina hesitates in taking off her nightgown, taking a deep breath as she pulled the blue fabric over her head. Left standing in her undergarments, the princess quickly requests a robe to throw over her body. “It’s far too cold this morning, you know. With winter coming and such,” Afina explains, but it's clear that this isn’t the true reason. 

Whether deliberately or not, San’s gaze never goes past Afina’s shoulders.

---

After a morning spent preparing for breakfast, Afina was ready to proceed downstairs. She thought about how Elfriede and her last left things; Would he still be angry? She swallowed hard remembering what he said. Fragments of their conversations seemed to be stuck on repeat in her head. _Don’t act haughty as if you haven't killed anyone yourself_. Afina fixed her gaze forward, and raised her chin as she entered the dining hall. _You should have seen the way your girlfriend knocked this guy down the stairs and snapped his neck._ Afina noticed that Elfriede is already at the table, and nodded a polite “good morning” at him. _Ring any bells Miss better-than-everyone Tyndall?_ She folded her hands in her lap, seated next to Elfriede, her posture stiff and formal.

After a greeting and thorough explanation of the status surrounding Yuria, Afina is the first to speak up. “Thank you for your hospitality, I truly appreciate all the help that the Faun family has had to offer,” she says, gaze fixed firmly on Elfriede’s parents. She didn’t want to admit what a help Elfriede had been, certainly not after they had been fighting, but it seemed that such an acknowledgement is unavoidable. 

“Elfriede has done a tremendous job at both keeping me safe, as well as imparting to me much crucial knowledge of Eraia,” Afina nods at Elfriede once more, their eyes making contact for a split second. The princess couldn’t tell what he was thinking, though he most definitely did not seem as relaxed as he had been whilst travelling. 

She continues. “I am not sure what Elfriede has told you, if anything at all. He has been so occupied with his duties, I am not quite sure I’ve ever even _seen_ him write home. But he is currently tasked by the Eraian military to escort me to Trisp for a cultural exchange of sorts. You see, though I come from Callora, much of my studies were taught to me by a prominent Eraian scholar. As such, I am travelling to Trisp to further my studies. I’m a light mage,” she said. Even through the formalities, there was an inescapable bit of pride beaming through as she said such a fact. 

“I actually do believe that my father, King Achelous Tyndall may have sent some extra provisions for Elfriede and myself to your residence? He did so with Elfriede’s permission of course. And they’re only more books with which to study, and some garments from home,” she states, though looking about the room rather quizzically, as if the packages might suddenly appear in front of them.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-12*

Elfriede had been up already when Nath arrived to knock on the door, his mind **quite** occupied with exactly the same things as when he had finally fallen asleep. Faun let him in and nodded to him. 

“Yes, I have been up for a bit, and yes I would appreciat---” Before he could finish Nath already began unpacking medical supplies. Elfriede sat back down on the bed and allowed him to do his work. Once he had finished his work he bowed and exited. Elfriede was semi-excited to get his wounds fully tended to, so he could function fully again and get back to training. It helped him take his mind off of things. He sighed thinking once again about last night. Had he gone too far? It stung his heart seeing her cry like that, but it also stung every time he thought about the danger Yuria could be in. He thought about going after her... and not for the first time...

---

Once Elfriede had dressed and entered the dining hall he locked eyes with his parents, now alone. He nodded to them respectfully but didn’t address them further. A few moments later Afina entered the hall escorted by the female servant who then curtsied and left. Jorund explained the situation with Yuria more in detail, which threw any plans that Elfriede had silently been making out the window. The boy figured as much, but hearing them say it gave him a strange sort of finality.

Elfriede glanced sidelong at Afina while standing stiffly as his parents addressed the wayward princess. She talked to them about their journey a bit, graciously complimenting the knight-lieutenant. For a brief moment she looked at him, as soon as their eyes met he looked away hoping she wouldn't notice him staring. His eyes met his mothers who stared at him inquisitively.

As she ended her introductions Jorund addressed his son about the nature of their stop in Lyall. Elfriede gave a brief explanation of the pirate attack, the loss of his dagger and his suffered wound. He glanced to his mother again who still seemed uptight but slightly more relaxed than the day before. As the food started to be brought out Jorund asked *If the trip had to do with this young lady*.

“A-ah yes well, I figured it important to show her the biggest city and the heart of our culture if she was to be staying in Trisp for a while.” He spouted hoping his feeble answer would suffice. If he was honest with himself he didn’t know why he wanted to stop at home with her so badly. He felt as if she should meet some of his family for some reason. He glanced over to Afina who was looking at him again and tried to shoot her a disarming smile, but his heart and mind were still so full of the current events that it felt so fake to him. He looked to the food and sighed. She didn’t deserve him like this… even if she did call him a *a reckless knight with an over-dedication to duty and an under-dedication to morals.* 

Despite it annoying him, he couldn’t help but smirk at the name calling.

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

Jorand spares Elfriede a look as his son speaks, Aria does no such thing. The matriarch of the Faun household intently watches Afina, both before and while the girl spoke. 

"That's quite impressive, I hear light magic is less popular outside of the nation. You must be quite enlightened." Jorand says, starting into the meal.

Jorand chuckles. "Yes, soon we'll a wedding to hold. May you find someone as accomplished as I did."  Aria looks to her husband, a small smile flashing across her face. Her husband returns it. 

"You have an excellent military record Elfriede, I'd hate to see you lose face over something like marriage." Aria says, turning to her own meal. 

"Indeed, as your story involving the Aster goes." Jorand nods. "You'll have to elaborate, the story will certainly be the talk of the town for awhile. Certainly don't want the details passed around incorrectly, do we?" Jorand adds. Aria nods and looks pointedly at Elfriede, telling her son to speak...

- - -

Jorand and Aria leave breakfast first, Nath arriving to inform them that they've received a correspondence. Elfriede and Afina are left alone for a mercifully few moments before San arrives, ready to escort Afina to her provisions and Elfriede to the arrive doctor. A short walk and Elfriede is left alone in the lounge, Afina brought to the parlor.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-19*

Aftter thier discussion Elfriede rises to be escorted by San to be healed of his wound fully. She and him joined San where Elfriede was left in the lounge with the doctor. He thought over his and the princess's short banter. He felt like some of the cloud had been lifted, but not all of it. There was still the fact that Yuria was missing, something that panged his heart every time he thought of it. He smiled at the doctor and bowed a polite greetings and murmured the typical Eraian words. He then partially disrobed and showed the doctor his wound and awaited further instruction. This had not been the visit home he envisioned...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

Afina stood in the parlor, staring through the stained glass windows. Ornate battle scenes played out on the colorful glass as the princess ran her finger along its smooth surface. She still felt a somber mood in the air, though it no longer carried the tense undertones of before. The princess pursued her lips; _I’ll be sure to approach him later_, she thought. _For now, I have to see to the packages that my father has sent me._

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

The priest of the Halse district is a familiar face, the man has healed you more times than you can count. The Faun's donations to the church are rather... *substantial* for his discretion on certain conditions of the Fauns. After he gets started, he begins to make a bit of small talk.

"It's been quite a while since you've been home Sir Elfriede. How old are you now?" he says. His question is apparently rhetorical as he continues. "24, a fine age. Some say the perfect age for many things, promotion in a military career, marriage..." 

"You'll be the first Faun to marry in this generation won't you? Yuria is caught up in her inquisitor work and all. any fine young lasses keeping your interest my boy?" the priest asks with a chuckle. 

"Though I'm sure you don't want to talk about her with an old coot like me! I'm sure to meet her soon, your 25th is just around the corner after all!" He laughs and begins chanting a spell for a few minutes.

- - -

San opens the door to a fine parlor in the manor, if sparsely decorated like every other. The primary features of the room are a center table accompanied by a two love seats and a couch; and the large glass windows that face the backyard. You can see a gazebo outside on a patio. 

"Your Father's packages are on the table there Mi'lady." San says with a deep curtsy. "He also posted a letter with them as well, it is on the side table. Feel free to make use of this room as you will, Nath will bring Lord Elfriede here for tea as soon as his wounds have been treated." San then curtsies again, stepping back against the wall by the door. The girl waits there, serving her role as a handmaiden. 

King Tyndall's letter is sealed when you go to open it. Thankfully, San provided a letter opener.

```Dearest Afina,

While I am gladdened to hear you are branching out and exploring the world beyond Laera, as your Father I cannot say I am pleased you are fighting bandits like a common soldier. You are of fine blood, and more importantly my daughter; you shant need to fight battles such as these. Were I able I would send a unit of my finest knights to escort you, though as I'm sure you can divine a foreign military unit will not be welcome in Eraia.

I am at the least, pleased to hear of your escort. This Elfriede Faun seems to be quite the knight and while I trust no one I've never met with your safety in light of your choice to enter Eraia I shall take what I can get. AS fo miss Enneka, I do hope her race is not a problem for you my Dearest. While I wish you not discomfort it is ideal you learn tolerance for that which disagrees with you. You have always been a passionate young woman, one filled with curiosity and intelligence. Yet at times you you make hasty decisions and suffer consequences you could have easily avoided. I hope you become closer to Miss Enneka, in such a way you grow as a person.

But more than anything I wish you out of Eraia. I have sent you your requested provisions, half a dozen tomes and clothing selected by your mother. Know that I only do so as I would rather you well armed in a foreign land than not. As you are of my mind I know you shall not listen to this request of mine. I require continued correspondance and promise of uneventful travel; travel without bandits or soldiers or pirates of any nature. Be safe my Dearest, and return to the tower as soon as your are able.

Regards, 
Achelous Tyndall, Wise King of Laera
```

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-23*

Afina’s hand shakes as she reads the last line of the letter. _Be safe my Dearest, and return to the tower as soon as your are able_. Afina blinks, re-reading the letter over and over. _Surely he can’t mean to return back to Theanovene, after all this time spent in Eraia?_ The princess folds the letter, sticking it in the pockets of her gown. _Father likely hasn’t left Callora before, he must not know the challenges I’ve overcome in my time here_, she thinks dismissively. _And if not, then I’ll surely prove to him that he is mistaken_.

The light mage turns over the books one by one, analyzing their titles. Light tomes, naturally. A book on healing magic, surely emphasizing her father’s fear of injury. A book on Eraian culture. _Written by a Calloran_, Afina frowned, setting it aside. There was no way that a book could tell her anything that she hadn’t already experienced herself. Fire tomes, she noted, looking over the next book. _Useful_. 

With two books left, Afina realized that there was one that she had _not_ specifically requested back when they first started their journey. _Laguz Prejudice Through the Ages,_ Afina read, turning the book over in her hands. This wasn’t relevant to her journey at all, what was her father trying to say? It was just like him to manipulate her reading list for her own good. She humbly had to disagree. She set it aside, picking up the final book.

The cover lacked a title, but Afina didn't have to know what it was to know the contents of its pages. The princess opened the cover of the black leather-bound book, and confirmed her suspicions. _When Laerans learn everything, at least we mean everything_, she thought, holding the book in her hands. Somehow, she had thought it would be heavier. _This is only a last resort_, she told herself, quickly hiding the tomes underneath the _Laguz Prejudice_ book. 

Afina then turned to the clothing that her mother had chosen. Running her hands along the blue fabric, it appeared that her mother had sent the winter variant of her current travel clothes. _She knew all too well_, Afina thought, melancholic as she ran her hand along the blues and grays of home. The princess would be sure to investigate the rest of her outfit choices later; all she had to confirm was that she would be adorned in the blue of Laera, and be prepared for the weather. 

Afina scarcely noticed as San set teacups on the table, each one directly in front of either sides of the loveseat that Afina sat upon. The princess had taken out the letter from her father once more, re-reading it in disbelief. A knock on the door startled Afina and she shoved the letter in between her stacks of books, careful to make sure that the black book was covered by the laguz novel. 

“Master Elfriede will be joining you for tea now,” San declared, and Afina nodded in approval.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-23*

Elfriede was distinctly quiet during the mage-doctors questioning and offered a few smiles at his talks of marriage and other rather forward questions. He had been healed by the man many times and he almost felt like an extended family member at times with the way he questioned Faun.

As the healing auras swirled over his wound and his flesh began to mend itself, he thought about the traveling they still had to do and Yuria of course. If they daudled here any longer they would run the risk of snow blocking thier path there or even his path back. 

Once the doctor finished up, Elfriede stood and stretched, immediately feeling more limber and energetic. A smile found it's way to his face as he  thought of getting his freedom of movement back. 

As the doctor departed Elfriede bowed politely to him and thanked him for all his good work. Just as he turned around, almost on queue Nath was waiting for him. " The lady Tyndall awaits you for tea Sir Faun." Elfriede nodded once again to him. 

"Please." Faun replied smiling.

**Bill** - *2018-04-26*

Nath opens the door to the parlor, revealing San serving Afina tea. A cup awaits him as well.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-26*

Elfriede spent much of the day gathering materials and clothes he needed for their trip the following day, even bothering to leave the manor a few times to pick up things he needed like rations and a new side arm. While finally settling down with Afina in the afternoon for some training and to feel how his wound was doing. He waited for her in the main room and sent San to retrieve her. 

Once she arrived after a bit of time Elfriede perked up. "Ah. The training room is this way Lady Tyndall!", which he said all too formally. He led her to a large room in which the Faun's had *of course* dedicated to martial training. It was unsuitable for magic training, but would be perfect for the them as it was stocked with training weapons and weights. It was also a way for the two to interact without stumbling over thier words akin to earlier in the day. He found himself fondly daydreaming back to the first few times they trained togethor in the woods.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-26*

Afina spent much of the morning repacking her travel bag, sending the things she no longer needed back home and repacking her new books and clothes. _This is ridiculous_, Afina thought as she went about her chores. _How does a princess embarrass herself like that? In front of a knight, no less_. The princess managed to avoid thinking about her tea with Elfriede for much of the day, until it came time to train in the afternoon.
“Good afternoon, Elfriede,” she nodded, walking in stride with the knight. She wondered what he was thinking about. He seemed joyful, but unusually tight-laced. _I hope such a demeanor is the by-product of his newly healed wounds, rather than something else_, she thought. _And who is he calling a lady once more!?_ Entering the training room, Afina was astonished with the arsenal of practice weaponry. 

Afina looked between the stock of prop weapons mounted about the room, and back at Elfriede. He was practically glowing. _He must be awfully proud of his family’s dedication to training, but with a collection like this, who wouldn’t be?_ Afina took a training sword off the wall that seemed similar in build to the one that Elfriede had gotten her. “What is it that duelists say? En garde?”

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

*San and Nath peer in through a crack in the door.*

*"She's the future lady of the house isn't she?"*

*"mmmmmhmm."*

Aria steps off the wall, saying nothing to her son's nor his companion's greeting. She walks over to the training blades rack, pulling a longsword replica from it. She spins on her heel, stepping into the marked combat area as the clicking of her shoes echoes through the room. 

"If you'd please Princess." Aria says curtly, motioning to the side of the room with a flick of her sword point. "My son and I have some business. Her eyes narrow as she turns to her son. She raises her sword, lazily pointing the tip to her son. She gives Afina not more than 5 seconds to separate herself from Elfriede before she grasped the handle of the sword and sprinted forward. 

Elfriede recognizes her opening motion without thought. The number of times he's fought Yuria, Aria, and Jorand in this manner counts in the thousands. First to three serious blows, a reset between each hit. 

Aria comes in low, her sword arm keeping her blade close to her front. Rather than slash she spins on her open side as she comes with in Elfriede's reach, feinting and swinging her blade up to Elfriede's neck with all the force of her spin behind it. She doesn't wait to pull herself back a half step, turning sideways ala a fencer to slim her profile and make her harder to hit.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-01*

As his mother approached the weapons he understood and breathed out a sigh of nervousness and anticipation. Young Elfriede had faced her on many occasions during his childhood but hadn’t for a time. Most of his training partners as of late had been classmates and Yuria occasionally (of which he hadn’t won a bout yet). With his current state he was unsure how he would be able to handle this skirmish, but he had the chance to warm up already so perhaps the ground was even.

Before he had the chance to really gather himself anymore Aria dashed forward at a speed akin to Elfriede’s. Her movements and subtleties were also extremely similar, for the Faun’s all shared a fighting style. The only one that fought somewhat differently was Jorund. 

As the lady of the house closed in she broke into a sudden spinning motion and the Knight Lieutenant responded with a deep lean backwards as he saw her sword change directions and come upward fast. He dropped low with a spin and attempted a backhand sword sweep and prepared himself for Aria’s quick counter attack. 

Of course he recognized the routine, fast movement, clean dodges, and short quick controlled bursts of attacks.... And highly competitive. 

*T’was the Faun way. They relished in and derived some worth from their combat skills. That is not to say they are deprived of familial ties and love, but they just showed it in different ways. ...Especially the proud Lady of Faun manor.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-03*

Afina bristled as she watched Aria swing at her son. _Strange, these military families_, she thought, eyes quickly following the skirmish. Her father and mother had never wanted to duel with _her_ before, but perhaps Afina preferred it that way. It was interesting to see how the Fauns fought so similarly, in a way. As the princess shifted from foot to foot, she felt the light crinkle of spell pages in her pocket. _No, it would be wrong to intervene in a duel between family, Elfriede has to win this one on his own_, she thought. Afina clasped her hands together, and watched the fight intently from the doorway where Aria had stood not moments before.

Aria deflects Elfriede's swing with a quick flick of the wrist. She bends her elbow and swings at Elfriede's jaw, ignoring the sword in her hand. She then spins her back knee forward, slamming it into Elfriede's stomach and knocking him back. 

Aria clicks her tongue and slashes her sword idly in front of her. She hold the blade at the ready, though not in front of her. Her stance leaves her front completely open, though she's on the balls of her feet and ready to move. She doesn't advance on Elfriede, her eyes watching him with an intensity Afina has never seen in someone before.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-10*

As expected his sword flew out  and away using its own momentum against him. As fast as he could he brought the sword back up to collide hard with Aria's neck swipe sending Elfriede stumbling back a few feet. 
He looked at her from behind his gaurd trying to steady his breath. She looked calm and controlled while clearly scrutinizing every move he made. Thinking of nothing else but the task at hand and her approval he reengaged quickly with a hard spin into a barrage of thrusts.

*Faun had trouble grasping the idea of wanting your child to win... but also fighting your hardest with a clear desire for victory. Sometimes he wondered if she was just trying to make herself feel better, or just simply being competitive for the sake of itself. Would she even be happy if he won today? or embarassed because she lost... 
Even with all of this... Elfriede saw himself in her. The intense desire to win, the over the top fighting pride at times... his mother was a relection of part of him and yet... He struggled to see her love for him at times. Every now and then she would be clear and open and Elfriede cherished those moments. But they were few at least from where he stood.*

Aria steps back as Elfriede's sword comes thrusting for her. She deflects the first, her lip curling in disappointment before the sword thrusts forward again, and then again. Each strike is careful and precise, Aria has to focus on not just the blade itself but Elfriede's movements to know where to block next. A ghost of a smile crosses her slips as her stance breaks, needs to dodge with her body rather than her blade. 

The smile is gone as fast as it came. She turns her dodge into a roll towards Elfriede. She comes up behind him and slaps his already turning blade aside with her own. Making her of her angle, she's able to hit Elfriede's sword hand and it cause him to drop his blade to the mat. She points her blade at his throat, making his surrender involuntary. 

There are a few moments of heavy breathing shared between mother and son, her eyes piercing into his. She lowers her blade with a audible exhale. 

"Better. That... show... you put on for the Lady was not up to the Faun standard. I worried you'd grown... soft." Aria finally says. Her voice is even, but approving. "Still, you are nearly 25. I expect better of you. Yuria..." Aria trails, realizing she unconsciously brought up her daughter. "Yuria has yet to have been bested outside of the family. I expect the same level of skill from you. You are my blood, after all."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-14*

A faint, melancholic smile played across Afina’s face as she watched Elfriede and his mother talk. It harkened her back to thoughts of her own family, depressing as they were at the moment. A father who just wanted to relegate her back to a tower, and not a word from her mother. The princess lowered her head, turning to leave. A door closed with a small _click_ behind her, the sound of which echoed in the empty stone hallway. Afina held her shoulders back, lifting her chin as she walked down the hallway. _Now isn’t the time to think about them_, she thought, though the familiar sting of tears threatening to fall burned her eyes. 
---
The Faun’s backyard was illuminated in flashing blankets of light as Afina fired off spell after spell. Wisps of white shot from the mage’s hand, flowing across the ground from where she stood. Another crackle and a plume of fire launched into the air, high above Afina’s head. Sweat beaded at her brow, but the princess threw herself into her work nonetheless, teeth gritted to push her focus. This was a tactic that Afina had developed over time; it wasn’t like there was anyone to confide in at the castle back home, save for shallow complaints to the handmaids. But this topic was… different. And Afina smothered feelings of rejection and loneliness and self-doubt in her studies. Even when such studying did more harm than good.

Her voice raising to a yell, Afina fired off more spells, rotating between light and fire with growing speed. A fireball manifested in the air a few paces away; it was immediately incinerated in a beam of light that shot from the princess’ hand. A column of fire shot up from the ground, only to be swallowed up in a detonation of light. Afina’s throat was growing dry, but she pushed on. Sparks of light exploded over her head, joined by sparks of fire as they rained down from above. Bare feet planted firmly in the grass, Afina had lost track of how long she had been in the yard to practice. Two hours, maybe more? The Fauns themselves had left her be, likely recognizing how hard she was focusing. 
    A halo formed on the ground around Afina, and a cascade of light shot up around the princess. Her hair whipped around her from the force of the burst, as Afina flipped to a new page to produce a fire spell. The light faded and the light mage began to recite the nonsensical language of fire magic, only for her voice to crack and catch in her throat. A fireball that had taken form in front of her quickly fizzled out. With an exhale, Afina fell to her knees, breathing hard. While being a mage did not take a significant amount of physical exertion, flipping through pages and directing her magic certainly took a toll after some time. Nevermind the mental exertion. “Dumb…” Afina mumbled to herself as she collapsed onto her back in the grass. _All of it is dumb_, she thought. Afina made a mental note to speak to Elfriede before they set out for Trisp once more; She couldn’t be starting their voyage with such negative emotions. And the knight just seemed to have a way of assuring Afina that everything would be alright.

The princess’ brows furrowed as she stared at the sky, and bright white clouds rolled past her vision. What had their exchange in the parlor been? After two continuous weeks spent at each other’s sides, one would think that there was nothing more left to hide between the two. Afina thought of how quickly Elfriede had drank his tea and absconded from the room, and couldn’t help but smile. His quirkiness in the encounter was all too endearing. She quickly re-centered her thoughts. Elfriede had made a fair point; she could _die_ trying to help him get his sister back. Surely it wasn’t just the princess’ fear of isolation in the tower that motivated her to help the knight in his quest. 
Afina raised her forearm to her eyes to block out the light from the sun. The road ahead was unsure, especially after Trisp, but she knew that Elfriede’s presence made her hopeful. _Maybe, there’s something more to be made of here..._ Afina thought, a small, thin beam of light piercing through the crack in her arm as she sighed. But the princess quickly dismissed the thought. _That isn’t for me_, Afina thought, sitting up in the grass. _There’s too much to be done for my kingdom for me to waste my time on flighty, self-indulgent, and highly-unlikely pursuits anyways_. Ridiculous, Afina_, she scolded herself. _Completely dumb of you._

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-14*

Elfriede nodded and looked sulking at his mother. He knew she was right, he had to train more and stay above his peers. He takes far too many risky moves while fighting and constantly pays for it. 
“I understand.” Just then, he heard a click which spun him around. “It seems as though Afina has stepped out.” He had not meant to take up so much of their time, but he couldn’t just say no to fighting Lady Faun. He hoped Afina would forgive him even if it was trivial. He respectfully bowed to his mother, “Please excuse me mother.” He headed out the door into the main room, but she was nowhere to be seen. He quickly decided that maybe she needed privacy. *I should probably head up to my room and change.* 
---
As he changed into his house clothes, the sky began to darken. He lit the reading candle in his room and grabbed a few of his study books to read through. Elfriede sat on his small reading chair in his room and moved the candle over by it.

After what felt like an hour, (it was always hard to tell when he was lost in literature) he began to notice lights dance on the wall. He began to ignore it at first but the lights got brighter. *Where is that coming from?* Faun sat up and walked over to the window, leaning on it slightly. *Ah.* He gazed into the backyard, which was relatively small in its own right. (It was a miracle that they had a backyard at all in this packed city.) He gazed at the training sorceress and her dancing lights, some white and luminous and some orange and candescent. The simple colors of energy twisted in hypnotic dances. He found himself watching for a few minutes almost in a trance at the beautiful display. Elfriede suddenly snapped himself out of it and looked away feeling rude. *I really shouldn't watch somebody without their knowledge. It’s unbecoming of a member of the Faun household.* He almost heard it in his mother’s voice. ...but he felt like he was missing something… so despite his better judgement he stared out the window at the wayward princess.

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

"That is quite an art form you've perfected, Lady Tyndall." a feminine voice calls from behind Afina. Aria Faun steps out onto the lawn a few paces behind the princess. Aria makes no motion to join the princess on the ground, or even look at her. The matriarch of the Fauns just looks off into the landscaping. 

"In all my years I've never seen a mage throw spells around quite like that. ...Perhaps it is a cultural difference I am not aware of. There is much out there we aren't aware of, as the holy nation and Eraia and as individuals who live in it. Differences can... make or break relationships, between countries and people. I know of Laera, and it's culture being rooted in the art of *knowing*. Perhaps the concept I speak of is foreign to you in it's entirety." Aria pauses. Her arms cross, the woman putting her weight to her back foot in a more comfortable stance. 

"But I would not insult your knowledge by implying you lack in it. What say you to the concept? Two different races, nations, people coming together despite differences between them? Can differences be reconciled or are we doomed to damn one another for what makes the other unique?" Aria says. The woman doesn't look to the prone princess, but her tone is all but a command. 

- - -

As if in sync with Afina's plop to the ground, the door to Elfriede's room echoes a knock. Jorand Faun steps into the room, slide against the far wall and leaning aginst it. He looks over his son with a critical eye. 

"I won't fault you for staring m'boy. Your charge is a whirlwind, and I wouldn't be surprised if she could create one as well." Jorand starts with a low chuckle. "Though it could also be said you're simply sinking yourself into your work." Jorand says with a bitter edge to his amusement.

"Elfriede, I am sure the news of Yuria has been hard on you. I... wish we were better equipped to help you. You loved your sister dearly, as I am sure you still do. We are... uniquely positioned to know exactly how you feel while being unable to guide you through it. It may be a failing on us as parents, in that view." Jorand sighs.

"There are many ways to approach it. You've seen your mother's, to assume the worst. She can't be disappointed that way, and it can't hurt her anymore than it already has. You could lean into that. Your own method seems tightly tied together with your charge, and if that can help you then I suggest you spend even more time with the light in your eye." 

"I am partial to faith. In Lylalel, of course, but also faith in my daughter. Yuria gained her rank and the responsibilities that brought us here because she had the skills to handle them. I will continue to believe she is exactly where she wants to be, at this very moment. I have every intention of burning every bridge I have with the church if I must for information on her wearabouts, of course. But I have faith that we're doing so to comfort ourselves; Yuria is fine and she will return to us when it's time." Jorand looks down, flexing his fingers idly. His hand balls into a fist. 

"Do your duty Elfriede. You have a charge, someone you cannot help but watch. Your duty to the Church, and if light shines on it, your duty to Lylalel. When you have, you'll come home. That will be the time to be at arms for Yuria." Jorand says, his eyes boring into Elfriede's. "Family is always first and foremost to a Faun, but this will be your chance to chase a tail after all. Even your sister would egg you on." Jorand says with a wry smile. He leaves on that note, the door lightly clicking behind him to herald in your thoughts.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-16*

Afina couldn’t help but feel defensive in the presence of Aria Faun. Perhaps it was her dominating military prowess that made the woman seem so alien to the princess, but Afina’s back straightened as she heard Elfriede’s mother address her. The light mage turned abruptly to see the military commander striding peacefully across the grass, gazing off into the distance at some unseen sight. The woman’s forearms rested at the small of her back, like a soldier standing at attention, but with a more relaxed demeanor. The princess hesitated; She was unsure whether she should remain on the ground or stand to greet Lady Faun. 

“Yes,” Afina began slowly, similarly gazing off into the distance. “Such magic is largely native to Laera. With a culture based in knowledge, eventually there comes a time that your opponent knows just as much as you. In such a situation, your next advantage should be speed.” Lady Faun was likely aware of such tactics, but in some way, Afina’s explanation made her felt more at ease. As if she had justified her training to the woman.

Afina hesitated less on the second question. _Can differences be reconciled or are we doomed to damn one another for what makes the other unique?_ It was the type of question that Laerans would debate in tea shops and inns until they turned blue in the face. Afina herself was no such stranger to these debates. “Society as a whole is better for our differences, I believe,” the princess said, getting to her feet finally. She still wore the practice clothes that Elfriede had provided her with earlier, bare feet cooled by the damp grass. “The marketplace of ideas and cultures allows us all to learn and grow from each other. Without such disparities, we would have weak militarites, naive leaders, and unskilled tradesmen.” 

Afina found herself motivated by the question, words running from her mouth. “We need our differences. Without them, we are nothing. Such is why my father’s council is comprised of individuals from all walks of life. There is always something we can learn from another. If only because of our differences. Otherwise we are no better than a hive. Than the common bee.” 

The princess was prepared to continue, but a nod from Aria was the signal that the woman had acquired a sufficient answer. 
---

The next morning, Afina was once again woken by San. Rubbing her eyes, the princess yawned, exhausted from her training yesterday. Her muscles felt stiff and sore, but the Laeran was ready to return to their voyage nonetheless. Afina shivered as she disrobed, the cold autumn air harshly apparent now that she had emerged from her warm bed. _Only a matter of time before it gets too cold to properly sleep outside_, she thought. _I can’t say I’ll miss the bedrolls when I’m staying in a cozy tavern_. Being bare in front of servants was nothing new to Afina; Even still, she pivoted her body ever so slightly away from San and held her travelling clothes close to her chest. Nonetheless, the pale white scar cut through the princess’ otherwise flawless skin, shining in the light of day. Afina pulled her jacket over her head. _That matter best goes ignored_, she thought. 

With a bow, San handed Afina her pack, and the princess nodded in acknowledgement. Her boots clapped against the floor as the princess walked to join Elfriede in the foyer. _I wonder how he is, I did not get a chance to speak to him after training_, Afina thought. She had fallen asleep soon after dinner in the Faun library. Embarrassed, Afina realized that someone must have carried her to bed. _You have to get a hold of yourself_, Afina shook her head. _A princess should not be carried to bed unconscious._ Another servant, one whose name Afina could not recall, pushed open the door for her and Afina found herself among the Faun family.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-16*

Jorund gently entered the room and Elfriede swiftly turned around, slightly embarrassed as he knew that his parents were clever and could quickly put together what he was just doing. Jorund quickly explained his thoughts which validated Elfriedes fears, but somehow relieved them. Elfriede nodded at his father’s insightfulness but his rhetoric jumbled the Faun boy’s thoughts yet again. His father also spoke on Yuria a bit, which further helped organize some of Elfriede’s stress. It didn't make him want to chase her less, but rather gave him a path to follow. He smiled and accepted his father's wisdom. Just before Jorund turned to leave, Elfriede stepped forward into his father’s open arms and briefly hugged him tightly. *He was always the more feeling of the two Faun parents.*
The door clicked shut and the Knight-Lieutenant was left with his thoughts once more, although a bit calmer. His thoughts wandered back and forth between his sister and the Tyndall princess.
He smiled a bit dismissing them altogether as it wasn’t doing him any good. He sat down feeling invigorated once again for his journey to Trisp tomorrow when one of his father’s phrases came rushing back at him. *“Chase a tail?”*

---
The next morning Elfriede awoke and the world was dark. *Am…. I …. Dead?... Is this what the afterlife is?* He suddenly realized he thickly smelled musty pages and he shot up. The book he was reading fell of his face into his lap with a *thwap* and the pages flipped wildly before the book fell between his legs and closed. 
He wiped the crust from his eyes and took a deep breathe and sighed in the chill morning air. *At least he did not oversleep.* He slid his legs over and down onto the floor. He undressed fully, raised his arms up and stretched out. His small auburn tail extended as far out as it could go as he yawned.
Faun enjoyed all the aroma’s that came with early fall that he could pick up with his sensitive nose in the chill air. It heightened his spirits even more. He put on a towel and went to bathe and returned to his room to fully dress in his new traveling outfit (more suited for the colder weather with a small fur trimmed hooded cape). Moments later he entered the foyer where his parents awaited him.

**Bill** - *2018-05-22*

The goodbyes in the Faun home as stiff, even for noble standards. Aria nods to her son, giving him a military salute; Jorand offer a hug, though it is quick and looked on by Aria. Given further promises of contact as soon as they hear more about Yuria, the elders of the Faun family bit Elfriede and Afina ado, leaving them to their travels again. 

Lyall is a massive city. Even with a carriage it takes a few hours to navigate across from the south west towards the north east gate. Elfriede, by either luck or ingenious planning, calls for an open air cart which gives Afina a full view of the city as they travel. Every block has a church it seems, their intricate spires and roofs standing apart from the other black stone buildings. Everything is black in Lyall, yet incredibly well lit with a white glow from candles and lights placed everywhere. There is no dark corner in Lyall, only and comforting light.

Trisp is a small town, beautiful in it's simplicity. You approach over a hill and look down on the town, windmills dotting the surrounding farmland adding the peaceful feeling. Most of the buildings in town have reddish roofs, assumably tile. There is much less black stone in Trisp than Lyall, a welcome change of pace from the rest of Eraia. The stone buildings are of a white tan stonework, giving the town a warm feeling. 

Most buildings are single story, except for a large building in an "L" shape on the western side of town. It's two or three stories and almost a fourth of the size of the town. If you squint you can see men in clergy purple walking on the balconies of the building. Between them and the tapestries you can deduce the building is in fact the monastery Trisp is famous for. 

The town is both bustling and peaceful at the same time as you enter it's streets. Vendors don't shout across the streets hawking their wares, yet passersby make a point to stop. Wagons of vegetables and fruit roll through town but at a pace that doesn't imped foot traffic or kick up dust. People wave hello to you as you walk into town, and the directions to the bathhouse are easily spotted. The people are a rustic sort, either farmers or scholars. There seems to be no caste between them, farmers and scholars chatting amiably in the streets. 

(ooc: You're coming in from the east btw)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

_At last_, Afina thought, surveying Trisp from the hilltop. The town was smaller than she had expected, but the sight of the long-awaited monastery was a relief. The town itself seemed to be built around the monastery, like accessories to the religiously iconic building. A light breeze tousled the princess’ hair as stared at the monastery. _Don’t forget that Trisp already has a light prodigy in its mists, and that you’ll be directly disobeying your father after your time here has concluded_, Afina thought, the negative sentiments nagging at the back of her mind. She glanced over at Elfriede as he stepped up to the hilltop beside her. Standing beside her, she took his hand in her own and squeezed lightly.

Afina sighed. She couldn’t think about her competition in Trisp; Whoever it was, she would be able to best them in light magic combat. She was more than qualified to do so. In Callora, they had always announced her as the “Lady of Lumosity” and “Light of Laera”. Could any _other_ light mage claim such a prestigious title? And perhaps thereafter, the Cardinal would impart upon her the knowledge that should couldn’t find in the largest of libraries back home. Such knowledge that could lead her to, one day, surpass the Cardinal in magic capability. The princess was confident that this visit would hone her light magic techniques beyond anything she had learned in Laera. _Laera..._ Afina thought. Her father knew she would blatantly disobey him, he even conceded to as much. And though she would continue to write, many of her accounts would be false for the remainder of her travels after Trisp. Perhaps she could trust Itory to relay falsehoods to her father, as she sent the real details of her travels to such a faithful servant. Afina would have to figure such a crucial detail out later.

“Come along Elfriede, let’s get to the bath house. The faster we rinse off, the faster we can get to the monastery,” she beckoned.
---
Soon after washing off, Afina and Elfriede stopped at a local eatery for Eraian food and a chance to relax before an undoubtedly busy time spent studying light magic at the monastery. As Elfriede ate his own meal, Afina began to write to her father to update him on their travels. _He requested correspondence, after all_, Afina thought, taking out her pen and ink. 
```
Dear Father, 
Elfriede and I have safely arrived in Trisp. After nearly three weeks of travel we have arrived in the small town of light magic. The monastery’s presence is very much felt here; it physically composes nearly half the town. The streets are lively without being bustling, and the people are quite friendly. It is truly a tranquil place to study light magic. 

As I write to you now, Elfriede and I have stopped for Eraian food at the marketplace, before setting off for the monastery. It is my hope that the Cardinal will be able to teach me things that Master Witella was unable to master himself. Because our papers provide for it, it seems to be that my escort and I will be staying within the walls of the monastery itself, which will surely prove to be an interesting experience. 

Another letter will follow soon, provided that my experiences at the monastery are both rewarding and challenging. 

Though I am far away, I bid a kiss to the forehead of every Laeran.

Sincerely, 
Afina Tyndall
Light of Laera
```

As Afina sat up from her letter, she saw Elfriede quickly look away. _Had he been… trying to read what I wrote?_ she wondered. “I didn’t write anything particularly special, if that is what you’re wondering,” Afina stated, turning the letter to the knight. “Just that we arrived safely. Ah, and this part is to remind every Laeran citizen that I am protecting them. I see how such a gesture may be limited to my own cultural influence.” The princess said, pointing at the line in her letter. “For example, if our roles were reversed, and it were I protecting _you_, the first thing I likely would have done once we met was k-.” Afina cut herself off as the server brought their food, realizing how such a phrase may not have the same meaning in Eraia. 

“Nonetheless,” Afina continued as the server departed. “It’s a common gesture, and its meaning transcends all social classes. Parents kiss their children’s foreheads, spouses kiss each other’s, nobility will kiss their subject’s.” Afina leaned in close with a coy smile, speaking in a hushed whisper. “If those nobility are worth anything they should, at least.” 

Afina sat back with a laugh. It felt good to be teaching Elfriede a thing or two about Laera, especially when she had much more of a familiarity with his homeland than he did with hers. And to speak to another noble who would understood the humor of poking fun at others within their class? Even better. The princess truly felt she was getting the relaxation that she needed before throwing herself back into her studies. "After this, let's head to the monastery," Afina said, looking up at the towering building.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-24*

During their travels for the next several days Elfriede found himself lost in thought while traveling. They spent each night close to each other until the day they crested the last hill and Trisp came into view. The bitter sweet site marked the end of their journey. Afina took his hand in hers as they shared the moment of what they had worked towards for nearly a month. Two strangers meeting and overcoming hardships together… along with some others they met along the way. But now it was just them alone, the knight protector and the wayward princess, truly a duo to be reckoned with should you face them with wits or combat.

Faun was excited and happy that they had overcome so much, but he was scheduled to return home after a few days in Trisp to make sure Afina settled in properly. *Then.*,The proud knight had thought. *I will return to find Yuria.* Or so he had thought… now he wasn’t sure. He deeply cared for his sister but based on the information that his parents provided (or lack there of) he had begun to lose hope. *Besides*... He thought as his eyes found their way to his companion’s smiling face peppered by strands of blonde hair being blown by the wind. Faun felt more conflicted then he ever had.
---
After bathing, they ate Erain cuisine together and Afina wrote a letter home. Elfriede glanced over out of curiosity, which she had lightly scolded him for, peppering her response with some joke about Eraian nobility. Which he smirked at and scoffed jokingly.

As she returned to writing, Faun stared at her, examining her features, feeling as if up until this trip he had been blind to his beautiful companion. Faun thought *maybe* he would stay a few extra days in Trisp before heading back to Lyall.

Soon after, she finished her letter and she was ready to head over to the monastery. Elfriede truly hoped she would find what she was looking for here and Eraia didn’t disappoint her.

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

The monastery of Trisp is beautiful in it's simplicity. It's large doors are decorated with raised ridges in the wood, weaving a complex pattern into the door that all the while blends in. It almost seems to be designed to reward attention to detail. 

Afina's papers are quickly recognized by the doorman. He only keeps you waiting a moment before a man in clergy garb comes to meet you. With the utmost pleasantries he invites you to follow him to meet the Cardinal you've traveled so far to meet. 

You make your way through the long hallways of the monastery with ease. Others seems to part in the path of your guide, a higher ranking clergyman's right. The place is very clean, the wood floors shine as if waxed and the wall are smooth as glass. You see quite the variety of people, though all dress as members of the clergy. Young and old, even laguz populate the people of the monastery. In some of the open doors you see open rooms with circles drawn on the ground, sitting room with shelves upon shelves of books, and others that look like classrooms. Afina's garb and even Elfriede's Eraian marked armor draw plenty of attention. 

The guide brings you to a pair of double doors and motions for you to enter. Inside are two men, one sitting behind an oak desk and the other standing at his right. 

"Good afternoon, Princess Afina Tyndall of Laera. I am Morras Raive of Trisp, Cardinal of the Trisp Abbey." the sitting man says. He has hawkish features, narrow eyes that are accentuated by the wrinkles on his face and a slightly hooked nose. His smile is kind though, and he literally welcomes you with open arms, motioning for both of you to enter. "With me is my head Bishop Torin Dean." Morras says, the man to his right bowing in greeting. Torin is younger than Morras, with a baby face despite his good build. His salt and pepper hair goes well with Morras's gray, giving you a familial feeling.

"My pleasure mi'lady Tyndall, and Knight Lieutenant Faun." Torin says. His voice is deeper than you would have guessed. 

"Lylalel guided you here to us unscathed and it is truly a blessing. She clearly sees much potential in you Lady Tyndall, I look forward to seeing what she knows." Morras says. "Whenever I am restrained by my duties as Cardinal, Torin will take on your hospitality. I shall, as will Torin, to make your stay pleasurable as possible. It's for this reason I've asked him to join us." Morras says. "Now, from your mentors words I know we have plenty to discuss. Have a seat Mi'lady, Lieutenant Faun." He motions to the large leather arm chairs across from his desk.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

Afina glances at Elfriede briefly before taking a seat in one of the armchairs. "Thank you for your hospitality, Cardinal Raive, Bishop Dean." She bows her head at each in turn. "It is an honor and a privilege to finally be amongst the most prominent light scholars in Aurii. Master Witella spared no details in telling me of your prestige in particular, Cardinal." 

Afina wanted to asked the Cardinal all the questions she could about light magic. _How did he manage to accomplish a light vortex? And a light shield emission big enough to shield a town? Were the stories true?_ The princess, however, suppressed her fervent curiosity. She smiled. "Truly, though the voyage has been long, I feel truly blessed to experience Eraia and its culture." The princess could almost hear Elfriede snickering at her already; She had complained to him enough times about Eraia that he must've known her statement to be false.

"I recall your letter mentioning that this visit is not formally for teaching purposes, but rather a cultural exchange. How might this be structured then? I'm most keen on reading the light magic books that are available here, as well as inquiring about your own personal experiences, Cardinal, if that would be alright."

Afina looked about the room, tense. She had spent so long trying to reach Trisp that to finally reach the monastery was disillusioning. Such a location also felt unfamiliar, especially after spending so many days and nights underneath the stars. As the Cardinal spoke, Afina looked over at Elfriede, hoping to read his thoughts from a glance alone. She felt uneasy in the new location; maybe Elfriede shared the same sentiment.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-28*

They finally walked into their final destination. Elfriede sat down in the leather chair and was silent as Princess Tyndall and Cardinal Raive conversed for the first time. He knew this was an important meeting for the both of them. For it was a big step in Eraia’s history, while simultaneously being something that Afina has talked about since leaving. Needless to say a knight interrupting a cardinal to speak. He looked down to the table and began to fall into his mind, as he had a lot on his mind. Faun decided he was gonna stay a few days to make sure the princess got settled in, they could discuss a few important things, and say goodbye. 
---
*”Cardinal if that would be alright.”*
As he came back to, he glanced over to Afina who was looking at him side eyed, expectantly. Elfriede wondered what was going through her head, but he realized he hadn’t heard much of the conversation. He wondered if something concerning was said and immediately started playing close attention. Most Cardinals and Bishops in Eraia that he had met were rather ritual, but never would say anything outside of their post… Elfriede at least trusted them to behave predictably. Maybe Afina just didn’t understand something cultural, but they would have a chance to discuss this later… among other things.

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

The Cardinal laughs heartily. Despite his age it's a strong laugh, the jolly kind that can make onlookers smile. "You are *most certainly* Witella's student. He had the same streak of curiosity, all those years ago. Got him into a rife of trouble, mind you. Lylalel lit his path from the dark more times than I could count, though I can't imagine anyone else having the ingenuity to take those paths she provided." Morras says. 

"We have four days for your visit, five if you count this afternoon and the day you leave. I apologize we cannot extend that stay, but we have other guests arriving and we'll need the accommodations mi'lady and her knight will be staying in."

"I would be happy to set some time aside to speak with you, though I'm afraid I cannot today. Being a Cardinal of My Lady of Light is a blessing I would not trade for all the gold, time, and books in Aurii, though it does eat at my personal time." Morras continues with a twinkle in his eye. "I shant schedule your time as well, I will present you with options which you may explore on your own. Asides from chats with myself, I offer you shadowing any lecture given here at the monastery, full access to our library and training rooms, Bishop Torin's expertise, and a bed I suspect you'll like scarcely use." 

"My recommendation to you would not be to bury yourself in tomes the next four days. I know that sounds contrary to your goals, but in my experience you can learn greater secrets from other's lessons than from the dust on the spine of a tome." he says with a wink. "Now, lest you have any pressing questions, I'll send you on your way with a tour from Torin. I wish you the best of luck in your studies mi'lady Tyndall."

Torin points out a variety of the rooms in the monastery as you walk past them. It seems the general trend is lecture rooms reside in the east-west running wing of the monastery, while the practice rooms get full sun on the north-south wing. At this time of day the sun is starting to come from the west, illuminating the rooms naturally via their large windows. The warm wood floors reflect the light into the halls. 

The library is located at the conjunction of the wings, and towers three stories tall. A spiral staircase is the central piece of the library, holding bookshelves set in the areas one doesn't walk on. Every surface of the staircase that's not used for walking space is room for more books, an astounding and unique design. The rest of the walls are, needless to say, book shelves as well. Additionally there is one ring around of standing bookshelves on each floor of the library. 

"The library isn't completely full, I regret to inform you. While our collection is large, this library was built to never truly be filled." Torin comments. 

Small study rooms are scattered about the monastery as well, and offices much like Morras's border the library itself. The sleeping quarters are located above on the second floor of the monastery wings. The north-south wing has larger bedrooms than the dormitory style in the east-west wing. Torin tells you going beyond the first block of that wing is forbidden, as it is where the upper level clergy reside. The guest rooms however, are close to the entrance to the wing. 

As you return to the main level, you pass by a cracked open door on the second floor. Inside is a girl of no more than 13, working diligently at a desk. Her room is bright and colorful, with personal effects strewn about the room. Torin tisks as he sees it.

"Enera! Has the Cardinal not told you a thousand times to close that door?" Torin barks. The girl inside jumps at her desk.

"I apologize Bishop Dean. It just got stuffy today..." the girl replies sheepishly. Torin seems unamused. 

"Pray to Lylalel I don't tell the Cardinal of this before his evening visit." Torin says, closing the door for her. "I apologize mi'lady, children are how they are and we occasionally must raise our voice to teach them the correct way of things." he says with a slight bow of apology.

- - - - -

"That is the extent of our home. It is not exactly humble, yet we describe it humbly." Torin says. "While I would love to see your ability for myself so I may plan my own lecture for you, it is the dinner hour and I'm sure mi'lady and her knight are hungry. In interest of seeing our culture in all it's glory, the Cardinal recommends you take the opportunity to head out into town for meals when you are able. He feels you'll be able to appreciate Trisp at it's best this way." Torin says. He pauses looking over Afina. 

"... I look forward to seeing your technique. The Cardinal speaks highly of you, for one of your age." he says politely. He then bows, and leaves you to your own devices.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-31*

Though Trisp was the safest town that the two had travelled through yet, the Light of Laera still walked with her arm locked with the Eraian knight’s. Afina had already bought a satchel (for more convenient transport of tomes), a palm-sized light magic book, and a few swatches of fabric for her own transport back to Laera. The autumn hair was laced with the fragrances of every stall that Afina and Elfriede passed; The aromas of fruits and desserts fresh from the harvest season were the strongest among them. 

_This may very well be the last time we are together on unimpaired terms_, Afina thought, glancing about the marketplace. Afina planned to spend some time training in the library at night. Afterwards, hopefully she would be able to approach Elfriede alone. And should the worst come to pass… _Well, at least we’re to be parting ways soon_, she thought. The princess quickly shook off the despondent feeling; She should enjoy the time that she was already guaranteed to have. 

Afina adjusted her cloak, suddenly feeling quite warm despite the cool weather. Her hand hesitated at her collar, as her hand no longer feeling the cool metal of her family’s pin. The Laeran froze, hands patting down her tunic for any sign of the silver Tyndall crest. “Oh no…” she murmured, fumbling through her new satchel. “It seems I… possibly misplaced something important…” Afina said, hoping that she had set down such a valuable heirloom when she was unpacking somehow.

Afina hurried shoved her bag into Elfriede’s arms and books and fabric alike tumbled to the ground. Flustered, Afina grabbed the small light book off the ground. “I’m sorry, I’ll return quickly!” she declared, leaving Elfriede to pick up the cloth and books. Among them lie _Laguz Prejudice Through the Ages_ and _Simple Eraian_, books that Afina’s father had sent her but she had intended to sell for a profit, finding them useless in her studies. “I will be back!” she called over her shoulder, sprinting for the monastery. 
---
Afina hurried up the steps of the prodigious building, clasping her small light book close to her chest. _Please, please, by all the knowledge of Aurii, let the brooch be in my room_, she hoped, clutching her tomes so tightly that her nails dug into its binding. The princess barreled up the steps, shoving her way between two visitors (for they wore no clergy attire), a man and woman, standing at the door. “Aside, I have urgent business!” she declared, shouldering the man out of the way. Before she could open the door, however, Afina felt the sudden sensation of a hand upon her shoulder. 

_Elfriede would certainly be disappointed if I dismissed him, only to be captured_, Afina thought, spinning around quickly. By the time the Laeran had about-turned, her tomes book had already been flipped open in her palm, and a small ball of light manifested in her hand.

Desii didn't have to be asked twice if she'd rather go to the monastery over finding an inn. Everyone who studied magic in any way knew about the Trisp monastery. It was the absolute center of the world for light magic users. Her expectations weren't great though, she knew she wouldn't be staying in this town long enough to apprentice with someone, and light magic certainly couldn't be learned in a day. Still, just the chance to visit such a crucial place in the study of magic set her heart aflutter.

Content to let Eliran lead, as he actually had business with the clergy, Desii bounced lightly in her boots as she waited by the door. This left her off balance as a young woman older than her plowed past her, leaving Desii to fall backwards onto her rear off the side of the stoop of the Monastery. Groaning with familiarity with such a fall, she rolls onto her hands and knees before standing up slowly. She misses Afina's aggression towards Eliran entirely, but catches the tail end of her enthusiastic greeting. Desii walks back around to the front of the stoop to rejoin Eliran as the two chat.

"Ah, Hello!" Desii says cheerfully as she steps up the stoop. She gives a wave to Afina in greeting. "It certainly seems like you're a friend of Eliran's, I'm Desii Manette of Hylley." She says, her greeting routine but kind. She quirks her lip halfway through the word Hylley however. She wasn't trying to broadcast her heritage to the Eraians. She shakes her head lightly, the tips of her hair fluttering against her neck.

"Thank you for taking us inside. If I might ask, do you know of anyone here who may provide some entry level tutelage of light magic? I study Anima and I'd love to learn about light magic while I'm in town." Desii continues, following Afina and Eliran inside.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

Afina nodded a respectful hello at Desii, hand folded in front of her. “Hello Desii, I am Princess Afina Tyndall of Laera, of the kingdom Callora. Eliran and I have been friends since childhood,” Afina stated, glancing over at Eliran as she she spoke, as if to garner his confirmation. He simply nodded. 

“If you’ll follow me,” she ushered, leading the two inside. Where Afina walked in front of her entourage, she quickly fell into step with Desii as the Hyllian inquired about acquiring knowledge of light magic. Afina threw a quick glare at Eliran, as if to say “why didn’t you tell me” before turning to Desii with a smile. 

“If I were to be frank, I would say to go to my hometown and learn from Master Witella for the most expert teacher. Sadly, that is quite far, and he is under the sole ownership of the royal family. His pupil however… _I_ might be able to teach you. You know, they call me the Light of Laera for a reason. I’m here on prestigious visit myself to hone my light magic skills. I would be glad to instruct you in the ways of light magic. I myself am a pupil of fire magic, perhaps we might be able to trade knowledge.” 

The princess continued. “There is, of course, no pressure to accept my offer. But I find the pupil is meant to be smarter than the teacher in eventuality. For the scholar is the sum of all the knowledge that he has garnered from his teacher,” Afina instructed, almost robotically, mechanically, like she did in her youth. Afina hesitated for a moment, remembering her time spent studying light magic from Master Witella. He had never been a harsh instructor, but he was not one for lavish praise either.

Lost in thought, Afina reflected upon her mentor for the first time in a long while. Master Witella had come to the royal family of his own accord soon after the princess herself had been born. Afina’s father, King Achelous, had been hesitant to appoint a light mage to the position of head instructor, but it was Afina’s mother, Queen Leora, who had insisted. Afina never knew the details fully, but it seemed that such a debate was a point of contention between the two for some time. Nowadays, her parents were both equally proud to have raised the “Light of Laera”, but it was not always the case. Afina had been practicing light magic since the age of ten, and it was only at the age of 17, when Afina returned from university to continue learning from home, that Master Witella once admitted that Afina was the strongest light mages he had ever taught. Surprising and impressing her mentor was always something Afina considered her greatest achievement.

“Anyways,” she said abruptly. “His Bishop’s office is here.”
---
The bright silver crest of the Tyndall family shined on Afina’s cloak as she departed from the monastery with her entourage. It was comforting to know that her family’s crest was once again at her side. The Laeran remembered when Eliran would visit the Tyndall residence as a child. He had a similar family crest, embossed in metal. The sign of the Cantaret family was always a friendly sight for young Afina. Even after the fall of the Eblian nation, the Tyndalls were never hesitant to welcome the Cantarets into their home as guests, and near equals. Something about her grandfather being friends with Eliran’s.

The sun had begun to make its descent in the sky, and the late afternoon chill had begun to seep into the air. The princess drew her cloak up around her. She would have to find Elfriede soon; He would be upset to find out that she had been cavorting with a friend from her childhood instead of making her way back to him. _Especially after I’ve admonished him for straying many times already_, the princess thought sheepishly. “If I may,” Afina declared. “My escort is waiting for me in the market, so if you would like to come along, we can meet with him in a timely manner.”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

Eliran followed Afina through the monastery, listening to the girl go on and on. He rolled his eyes when she offered to teach Desii  _God help the soul who has Mrs "I believe in myself so it works" as a teacher_ he thought to himself. Afina was a good and close friend, but even Eliran had to admit she had a few glaring faults, racism being one of them. _Shes going to get a kick out of Aldus_ 
- 
As they arrived at the Bishops office, Eliran quickly entered and delivered his letter. "All right we're all done here, let's get your emblem and head out." He said cheerily, having pocketed a good amount of Eraian coin. It wasn't like money was an issue for him, but having the coin of the country helps with bartering when you need to. 
-
As they exited the building, Eliran looked at the slowly fading skyline, "Yes lets, if I remember correctly our companions should also be in the market, perhaps we could all eat together?" He offered in response to Afina's request to make haste. He looked forward to meeting the girls guard, Eraians had a tendency to be easily thrown off by many Theanovene traditions and customs, and it was always amusing to catch one off guard when possible. _Maybe I'll greet with with a jolly cheek peck as I thank him for protecting Afina  for so long..._ he thought to himself, _or maybe we can trade some good stories of her oddities_  Whatever the case, Eliran  knew it would be an interesting turn of events.

Desii is quiet through Afina's *introduction*, her eyes widening to the size of saucers and her eyelashes fluttering. Her thoughts race a mile a minute.

*Afina, no, Princess Tyndall must be incredibly accomplished to be called the Light of Laera! Laera is only a kingdom over from Hylley too, she garnered so much fame so close to home. If only I had heard about her before, I could have gone to Laera rather than Eraia! Well, then again, she's here right now so if I **had** gone there I'd have missed her completely. Still, she had a mentor there, though I am loathe to apprentice again, after Zaimar...*

"That's a wonderful offer Af-Princess Tyndall!" Desii says as Eliran steps into the bishop's office. "And I uh, apologize if I've offended you in anyway, I did not know of your status." Desii says sheepishly, stepping into a slight curtsey. While not a true skirt, she holds the side of her hip cape out to the sides to complete the image.

"I couldn't pull you from your duties here however. I'm sure many people here wish to speak and learn from you as the Light of Laera Princess. I came to the monastery expecting at most to read some of the tomes enshrined here, or potentially join a group lecture if one happened to be for beginners. I couldn't possibly commit to being under one's tutelage, not right now." Desii says. "I'd be happy to show you any of my skill with Anima magics, I have an intermediary knowledge of each element. If it may serve the Light of Laera, I'd be happy to spend time with you mi'lady." She says with a wide smile.

- - - - -

"Ah, yes, the directions Aldus received from the bath house owner lead towards the market district. With the size of Trisp, I'm sure we can't miss them." Desii says, following along Afina's brisk pace which Eliran matches with his longer legs. The shorter brunette has to walk a little faster than normal to keep pace. Leaving the monastery without speaking to a clergyman (asides from the one who asked if she need directions to the exit) was counter intuitive, but Desii wasn't about to force Eliran to split from his childhood friend.

She chuckles once to herself. It wouldn't be that hard of a choice, of course. While the whirlwind first day cemented a form of bond between her, Eliran, and Aldus (Desii still avoids thinking about the consequences of that night); it's been harder to bond with the men she's been traveling with. Oh what her mother would say if she knew that last part. Desii smiles at the thought. *Mom always wanted me to get out and play with the boys once and awhile.* she muses.

Desii looks anxiously between the back of Eliran and Afina's heads, waiting to hear the Princess's reply to Eliran's suggestion. The Hyllian loved the idea of spending more time with the Princess. How many times would a normal, peasant girl like herself get to dine with a Princess? One whose a mage as well? Desii bit her lip in excitement at the mere thought.

```splitting from head table```

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-26*

Elfriede did not sleep well that night, far too much time was spent staring at the ceiling, both reliving the tender moments from that night over and over, while also thinking about his sudden withdraw. The disappointment on her face was clear, his as well. 

After several long hours he finally he finally passed out and awoke late in the morning hours. Much later than Elfriede was used to. He slowly arose and sat looking down lethargically before finally rising and readying himself for the day. Once he had donned his armour he walked out and passed Afina’s door, finding it unsurprisingly empty.
---
Elfriede spent the last hours of the remaining morning patrolling around the perimeter of the monastery. It was a nice quiet walk that gave him the opportunity to consider everything on his mind. After several hours he took a break to bathe, somewhat out of necessity and somewhat out of boredom... and to get his mind off things. 
---
Faun Entered Trisp’s bathhouse as he had done when they arrived in Trisp, changing into a bathing towel and paying the small fee for the caretaker to watch his belongings. He walked into the decorated bathroom, clad with religious symbols and candles and slowly submerged himself in the waters, trying to let them relax him. He looked around the waters, *Not very busy for this time of day…*, there were only a handful of others in the waters on the far side of the pool. Someone had also let small pink flower petals afloat on the water's surface. *Perhaps a foreigner? Or maybe someone thought it would be pleasing to the goddess.* Faun closed his eyes and sighed lightly. He would relax a moment before washing off.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-29*

After getting in bed Eliran quietly waited for Aldus to leave, hoping it had ended the conversation. Not long after however,  he could here Aldus talking to somebody in the Hallway. _whatever_ Eliran thought, _my name needs a nap_.
That night, sleep came to him in a slow process, he hadn't drunken any alcohol, and frankly the harder he tried to go to sleep the harder it was. Thankfully after a while he drifted into midnights embrace. 
---
The next morning Eliran was unsure of what to do, he was in no mood to see his companions, their questions about his identity would be bothersome, and he was positive Nokri would try to start mooching off of him as soon as she got the chance.  Seeing that it was getting to mid or late morning however, Eliran decided to stretch and get on with it, figuring the Market would be a good starting place, as Aldus and Nokri had already visited and probably wouldn't go back so soon. After a few hours bartering and working with the local venders, Eliran had started to earn a slightly sweaty appearance as he was still wearing his Theanovenian clothes, that were a little heavier than what the local Eraian fashion and weather warranted. Buying a new set from a clothing vendor, he made his way to the bathhouse, intent on cleaning off and taking a break before he changed into his new garb. 
---
As the Theanovene switched to an appropriate bathing towel and entered the bath, he asked the caretaker if he could bring something in with him, and with a few lines about the rejuvenating effects and fair scent they'd produce, which would surely appease the goddess, he was allowed to bring in a mix of flower petals he had found fresh on the market. _A lucky buy considering they're almost out of season_ He had thought.
 Having let the petals spread through the entirety of the bath, Eliran settled into the bathwater letting out relaxed sigh, "sometimes it's good to be alone" he mused outloud to himself.

---
After a surprise run in with Elfriede, Eliran was unsure what to do with the rest of the day. He half considered waiting for the knight to come out and ask if it was possible to join him. In all honesty, it'd be awkward considering, but Eliran was at a loss without somewhere to train his bow, and knowing the Eraian's cultural view of music, he wouldn't really be able to play openly till much later and only in very specific places. _Well I could play a song praising Lylalel I guess_ he mused to himself, knowing full well how bored he'd have to be to do it. For now he pondered slightly outside the bathhouse, not sure of where to go.

As Eliran had popped a squat outside the baths, sitting on a nearby bench, he thought of the request Desii had made of them, to find Enera. _I forgot to ask Afina about that last night_ Eliran thought, chiding himself. _I guess I'll need to head back tonight..._ He spotted Elfriede, now a clothed man, walk out of the baths _Or I could just talk to knight boy about it now._ He realized, wondering how to smooth over another awkward start to a conversation with Elfriede. From their first meeting, to the run in within the bath house, Eliran knew that asking the knight for help after a lowkey threat while nude would inevitably be an oddity. _And here I've always been one for social grace_. he shook his head. "Might as well just get it over with" he muttered to himself, "Sir Faun!" he called out, quickly standing and running over to catch the night before he got to far.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-01*

As the Knight-Lieutenant stood thinking about the rest of the day he heard a sudden voice with jolted him and made him jump ever so slightly. He spun to she the familiar face of the man who had just made him quite uncomfortable a moment ago. 

Elfriede turned back towards him with a somewhat scrutinizing glare, clear off put by the man. “What can I do for you Eliran?”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-09*

----
After Eliran caught Elfriedes attention, he lead the knight back to where he was staying so they could continue they're discussions more privately. talking of Enera with Elfriede was risky, as the man was a soldier for the Eraian Military, and those were exactly the people Eliran would typically avoid talking about the potential cross-border kidnapping Enera's tale entailed, but he was hedging on a hopeful gut feeling. "My rooms this way," he said leading the Eraian upstairs. _I really hope Afrin's trusting the right sort_. He thought to himself.

Eliran exited the Inn and stretched, his lute case on his back. "Ok time to talk to Afrin and make sure she doesn't do anything stupid." _Probably should check in on Aldus and crew as well_. "Ready to go?" he asked the Knight Eliran knew was probably tired of his presence.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-10*

Faun shouldered his pack and sighed a bit. "Alright, let's head back Canterat." 
--- 
He lead Eliran through the market distract, or rather on the outskirts of it for faster traveling through town. He figured the bard knew his way around, but he was leading the way all the same. 
He spoke little during their walk, still warming up to the bard and his strange antics. 

He was smooth, and yet not. It frustrated Elfriede that he couldn't decern Eliran's intentions in conversation. 

They soon arrived at the monastery finding that Afina was indeed not there.
