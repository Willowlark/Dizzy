The circus had been in town for the last week, their big top and carriages occupying the entirety of a city park. Today was to be their last day in town, dedicated to packing up what was left of their show and enjoying the city for one last night. It's a rather somber sight to see half the circus taken down, half the wall of the big top missing and performers out of costume bundling up gear in the park. Despite the state of the set, the performers smile and laugh, enjoying the end of a successful visit to the city. 

A group of soldiers attracts a fair amount of attention at a circus. The dragon they pull behind them attracted many times that. Soldiers and miltiamen shout out requests to the circus staff, particularly for a elephant cage to be empty and wide open. In a grand show of their professionalism, the men and woman jump into action setting up the cage for ZaRel. No time is wasted sealing the dragon behind the massive steel bars. 

The cage itself has a bottom to it, so ZaRel isn't left to stand on bars. It's bars are massive, almost columns in width, yet their rather widely spaced. An adult could theoretically wiggle their way through with enough acrobatic technique, particularly the acrobats of the circus. The lock on the door is massive, and it's outright amazing it can be turned with a key that's not the size of a sword.

The soldiers all stretch and groan once the door is locked, muscles burning from their exertion. Even then; the Eraians watch ZaRel closely, their fervor for his head not diminished in the slightest. The leaders of the Eraians and the miltiamen walk away in heated discussion, the Eraian leader barking a handful of orders to his men before leaving the area. The men quickly organize a guard on the cage, two men patrolling around the perimeter of the cage while a third stands before the gate.

**lapost48** - *2017-11-02*

ZaRel is enthused by the effort these humans are going through in order to keep his massive form captive. *They clearly haven't seen my human form if they are willing to place me in a cage with such large gaps between the bars. If I transform back i could easily escape...but then they would know what I look like.* ZaRel realizes it has been quite a while since he assumed his true form, he hadn't been a dragon since flying to this continent, and decides that it is not only the best tactical decision to keep his identity hidden, but also a more comfortable option. *I can get away whenever I need to. Although I shouldn't wait long to find Ienzo again.*

*Maybe these guards will be of some entertainment while I am confined.* ZaRel turns to the guard by the gate and lies down on his stomach. "Why do your people fear me? I understand my kind are rare, but an agent of evil? That's one I haven't heard before. You may call me ZaRel." The guard doesn't respond, shuffles his stance feeling less than comfortable with the massive creature speaking to him so closely, ZaRel continues, "I have not heard of this Lylalel, however, I am new to this land. I understand combatting that which you fear, but perhaps if you and your companions took a moment to speak with me I may surprise you. You seem to believe I am here to corrupt some light, and I assure you, this is not the case. If I am doing some kind of corruption unintentionally I would like to put an end to it. Please, could you speak to me about the light that is given by this Lylalel?"

ZaRel does want to hear about Lylalel and the stories her people tell about her. As a god himself, he likes seeking out lore of other gods who may have come before his time, and if it can help him build a rapport with the guards and possibly make it out of here with his identity intact it could be even better than an informational conversation.

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

One of the patrolling guards stops by the door guard as ZaRel engages the guards. The door guard, a younger man with blonde hair visible under his helmet replies.

"Surely you jest? You have an interest in Lylalel? This beast has quite the sense of humor. Are you not aware that you are the creation of Lyarlel? Lylalel's dark opposite?" he says, half turned to ZaRel.

"Anderas. Stop speaking with it." The patroller says. She's older than Anderas, with long brown hair in a high ponytail. She has an additional pin on her chestplate as well. "Are you a school boy whose forgot the scriptures? *Lyarlel's beasts are born with silver tongues and a thirst for gold; both red with rage and green with envy; and with hearts black as midnight.* You'd best not forget it." she lectures.

"Yes Lieutenant Serith!" Anderas snaps some kind of hand sign to Serith. Serith nods to the younger guard and his posture relaxes. He is only quiet for a moment before speaking up again. "Ma'am, do you have experience with demonic beasts? You sure know your stuff."

"I do not Anderas, very few do in this modern era." she says, looking over ZaRel's form. "Beasts like this are of an age long past, an age where Lyarlel had a greater hold on our people." 

"I don't quite understand Ma'am. *Lylalel protects and guides any who love her the way she loves them*, does she not? If the beast wants to love her, can it not?" Anderas questions hesitantly.

"No Anderas. That is the guile of the beast getting to you. Remember, *Lylalel gave life to all, yet Lylalel gave man her greatest gift; her light which burns in each of us. It is what makes us wise, able to love and live.* Where in that verse does it mention draconic beasts with her light?" she says. Anderas wisely picked up that the question was rhetorical and doesn't reply. "A being with Lylalel's light yet not man had to receive that light from Lyarlel instead. Rather than the pure core at each man, woman, and child this beast has a core of darkness and hate. Lyarlel cannot bestow a proper soul to his creations, and that is why we must cleanse them from the world. They are false beings." She pauses. "Indeed, you might even call it an act of mercy."

She's brushes her ponytail over her shoulder and adjusts the sheathed sword on her hip. "Anderas, you are relieved. You're too young to be around the silver tongue of this beast." 

"But Ma'am!"

"That's an order!" she barks. Anderas does the same hang sign before trudging off. Serith looks to ZaRel once, a contemptuous look on her face. She then takes over the position of door guard, actively looking for anyone who would interfere with their capture.

**lapost48** - *2017-11-06*

ZaRel watches this conversation with fascination. He did not realize the humans hold such contempt for God's other than their own. He turns to Serith after watching the conclusion of her conversation with Anderas, "If you will not allow him to speak with me, surely you will tell me of the teachings of Lylalel. My request is purely inquisitive and if it is my tounge you fear I shall keep quiet during your explanation. I'm not from a place familiar with Lylalel or Lyarlel and I want to know more of them both. If you believe me to be a creation of one I would like to know more of why you hold such disdain for him. Or better yet, why would Lylalel want you to crusade against Lyarlel's beings? Surely Lylalel herself has requested you do so. Or maybe you know she and Lyarlel hold each other in contempt and she would be pleased by your actions. I don't wish to move your beliefs, I merely desire to understand them"

**Bill** - *2017-11-09*

Unlike Anderas, Serith doesn't turn to face ZaRel when she replies. 

"You may offer quiet but simply engaging with one of Lyarlel's beasts is heretical. I may cut the tongue from your throat and still fall victim to your devilish words." she says.

Serith scoffs when ZaRel brings up crusades. "I see your ploy, beast. I'm a devout servant of Lylalel, you cannot convince me that she would not praise us as her crusaders for eliminating a beast like you. Lylalel guides us now as much as she did at Eraia's formation. Her scripture resides in our hands and her light shines in our hearts."

After ZaRel mentions contempt Serith's hand clenches around the hilt of her sword. "Beast, contempt is a petty emotion of Lyarlel. Hate, rage, and any other variant all come from Lyarlel's dark meddling with the world. Don't you even insinuate that Lylalel has the capability to hold such emotions. Lylalel is too kind, too forgiving of her brother and that is why we cage a beast like you in her name. She knows you are a product of evil and yet is unwilling to harm you. Where in that is the contempt, I challenge you. Lylalel's only" Serith makes an air quote motion, "fault is she cares too much for the monstrosities her brother creates to slay her beloved people."

"Understand this, beast. No matter the tale you tell or the web of lies you weave, I will not be fooled." she growls. The other guard patrols past the front of the cage and rounds the bend.

**lapost48** - *2017-11-09*

"You twist your own words. Lylalel would praise you for eliminating me but is unwilling to harm me? Your," ZaRel imitates the air quote motion as best as he can, "devotion so strong that you even admitted to acting against your god's wishes. I'm glad my people aren't belligerent like you." ZaRel has lost interest in this woman.

ZaRel begins his transformation back as soon as he thinks he is in a blind spot of the patrolling guard. As soon as he is back in his human form he takes a moment and reaches in his shirt to ensure his jagged purple stone is still attached to the string around his neck and dashes in the opposite direction of the two guards, squeezes through the bars of the cage and dashes into the circus teardown.

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

(ooc: since you've said you'll be adding to this and there's no one else at the table I'm not going to move anything along.)

ZaRel's tactical mind easily reveals the pattern the patrolman was going in and the best time to make his sprint. Dashing in a western direction, you pass around one large tent and break your line of sight with the cage. Unfortunately the large log (probably used as a bench on the big top floor) didn't enter your sight fast enough and you stumble on it, tripping into tent is was sticking out from; the one you just circled around to get away from the guard's sight. 

This tent hasn't had any walls taken down, ensuring you aren't about to make eye contact with Serith. Inside are two lithe Kissaelain laguz in leotards with their hair tight in tails that match their animal ones. They're accompanied by an athletic man with an impressive black mustache. The man is older than the girls, and stands up from where he was pushing the log out the tent. His voice is deep and booming.

"Hello there little one. Circus is closed dontcha know." he says with a chuckle. The girls on the far side of the tent start towards ZaRel as well, maternal smiles on their faces. They pauses as shouts sound from outside. ZaRel can guess what people might be shouting over in the center of the circus without much effort. The performers however look confused. They look back between you and the entrance flap which faces the cage.

As ZaRel's feet reconnect with the platform to the sound of the Laguz trapezee artist's applause, the flap to the tent flips open. Three Eraian Armsman and a woman ZaRel recognizes as Serith charge into the entrance way. They look around frantically with their weapons drawn. Serith looks between each resident of the tent and turns to the man on the ground.

"Have you seen anyone or anything suspicious?" she says with a military calm to her voice. the mustached man doesn't answer for a moment. Up above with ZaRel, the woman look at each other. 

"We have not ma'am." he says. "We've just been working with our potential new recruit up there." he adds with a jab of a finger in ZaRel's direction. Serith frowns. She then gives a deep nod and sweeps out of the tent, her Armsman following. The flap barely falls back in place before the man looks beyond it himself.

"Well I'll be. The dragon is gone." he exclaims. The woman on the platform with ZaRel grabs at him in a protective manner. "They don't seem to have the slightest idea where it went. They're checking every tent!" he continues, obviously amused by the Eraian effort. The arms loosen around ZaRel at those words. 

"Ugh. Why'd they bring the thing here in a first place? Kids play around around here." The other woman sighs. Her hands find purchase on her hips. "If I was in charge, I'd say we skip Eraia on the tour this year. This is crazy."

"That's how the military works my dear." the man says. "They come in, they take what they need, and they leave giving nothing back. And yet..." he turns around, letting the heavy cloth flap fall back down. "Citizens need them to have what they do." he says with a shrug.

"Oh spare us the wise words of the day. I thought we might skip it today." the woman sighs exaggeratedly, waving her hand in front of her. She turns on her heel, sliding down the ladder by the side rails. The laguz by ZaRel taps him on the shoulder and motions for him to climb down first with a smile.

**lapost48** - *2017-11-20*

ZaRel climbs down and walks over to speak with the man. "So about joining you guys on your travel, I would only need food and a place to sleep. I have no desire for coin. I just want to travel and be exposed to more of these lands so I can find who it is I am looking for."

**Bill** - *2017-11-27*

The mustached man leans back against the pole supporting the platform. "That's a hard life you want to sign up for. The circus brings smiles to everyone we preform for, but days of work and practice go into those preformances." 

"Oh hush." one of the Kissaelain girls says, waving a hand dismissively. "I'm Alysa, and my sister is Myra. The old coot is Jorg. He started out with the circus just like you are, a kid looking for a way to see the world. He's just trying to play to character." Alysa grins in the old man's direction, taunting him with a wave of her feline tail.

"You girls are just that, girls. You don't realize what it is to join the circus when you have a home to back to." Jorg says. 

"Just because our mother runs the circus doesn't mean we have no concept of life outside of it." the second sister says with her arms crossed across her chest. Alysa copies her posture. The two lean forward and press their faces in their elder's. 

"But it does mean we can bring him along if we want." Alysa says through what can only be called a shit eating grin. Jorg sighs but shrugs his shoulders.

"I suppose I should have warned you about the crazy bosses you'll have first." he says, throwing an arm around each of the girl's shoulders. His massive arms hold the girls in place despite a fair amount of struggling. Jorg himself grins.

"Welcome to the circus."

Night falls and the busy work of the circus finally comes to a close. Not a tent remains standing and everything is piled onto wagon up wagon. Assembled around a fountain in the now restored park sits the entire company. More than two dozen people fill this mixed bag; even in Theonovene it's hard to find this much diversity. Standing on the rim of the fountain is a older Kissaelain woman with dirty blonde hair and an eye patch. 

"Company! Excellent work!" she calls and the group cheers. "We've once again blown Theanovene out of the water with our skill and technique. We go north to Callora tomorrow, our first show in Hylley. I challenge you this, lets make the Hylley show so great that Theanovene will be jealous!" she says with a huge grin and a twist of her tail. The crowd again cheers and claps. 

"Excellent. I knew I could count on you. Tonight you've got free reign to explore and adventure in the city; though I pity anyone foolish enough to not be ready to work at sunrise tomorrow. Before I turn you clowns loose" there's a chuckle through the group at the joke "we've picked up some fresh meat. Alysa and Myra have seen the kid basically fly on a trapeze and I think he's got potential. But without further ado..." the woman winks.

Alysa and Myra, sitting behind ZaRel, wink back and shove the boy to his feet and in front of the crowd. The troupe leader extends a hand to him, bring him on the fountain rim with her. 

With a pat on the shoulder she says "Introduce yourself kiddo. The circus is one big family, except we actually care to remember your name." she says with a smirk.

**lapost48** - *2017-11-30*

"My name is ZaRel, and I am much older than I appear. I am looking for a friend that I knew a long time ago and I no longer know where she is. I am hoping that I will get to see many places and many faces while travelling with all of you. I thank you all for welcoming me into your family and I hope that you all can grow to accept who I truly am. I haven't much experience in these lands, but from the experience I do have I am often met with hostility so I am excited to be a part of a family that protects each other."

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

The assembled men and women of the circus aren't sure how to take ZaRel's declaration. After a moment of funny looks a small round of applause begins and continues. The troupe leader to ZaRel's left however breaks out laughing.

"The girls do have quite the eye! I think you'll fit in just fine her *boya*." she says through chuckles. She extends her hand to shake ZaRel's. "I am Niya, and as you might have guessed I lead the troupe. If you need anything, come to me or the girls." With that, she pats ZaRel on the back, motioning him off the fountain edge. She calls over ZaRel's head to the company at large. 

"Have at the city you fools! Whoever's late to return pulls the cart instead of the donkeys!" she bellows jovially.

---

The night was good and the morning after was decidedly not for ZaRel. The following two days were also quite rough on the apparent youth. Travel is hard for the circus as they move north into Callora. Heavy wagons and tired animals make the trip long and no one rides the carts but the drivers. Keeping all the carts in line and coordinated so they don't run into each other is another level of intricacy to the trip. And yet the troupe makes the trip faster than most, arriving at Hylley after only two nights on the road.

Hylley is a beautiful city dominated by a massive tree in the center of town. The tree's roots occasionally appear in back corners or even on side walks, creating the illusion that the entire city was built upon it's root system. The buildings are made of a white stone that must be plentiful in the area, and while there are less buildings that one would expect in a capital they make up for it most buildings being multistory. The open space is often filled with manicured grassy lots, adding to the overall appeal of the city. The overall appearance is that of place where nature is prominent and respected.

As if it's beauty was not enough, Hylley also welcomes you with the preparations for a festival in place. The large park around the central tree is buzzing with men putting together wooden structures, the overwhelmingly delicious smell of baked goods, and children being yelled at for being under foot. The banners that are being raised show images of a mountain, a waterfall from that mountain, and a familiar looking tree. Everyone working is full of smiles and laughing the day away. Whatever event is taking place, it's very popular.

This festival is where the circus directs it's caravan. the wagons circle around a large open section of the park and Niya emerges in the center, stretching her arms behind her back. 

"Well, here we are! The festival is tonight and we have a lot of work to be done. You all know the drill, get to it!" she barks and the chorus of affirmation is almost deafening to ZaRel. People break into every direction.

(ooc: I want to give you a chance to define your new role with the circus. If you want to be involved with a part of the circus (Niya is the ringleader and troupe leader, Jorg, Alysa and Myra are the trapezee artists) we've discussed we can aside or possibly have you write for anyone but Niya. We can also aside or you can come up with your own NPC member of a different part to the circus as well. Just take a post to setup yourself with the circus.)

```splitting from head table```

It is mid morning before Desii joins Aldus on the main floor of their inn. There is a muttered apology before she eats a quick meal, after which the pair are able to leave for the monastery. 

The monastery of Trisp is beautiful in it's simplicity. It's large doors are decorated with raised ridges in the wood, weaving a complex pattern into the door that all the while blends in. It almost seems to be designed to reward attention to detail. A clergyman serving as a doorman, his nose deep in a book, waves you inside. He says through the tome "The library is straight, at the end of the hall. The other areas of the monastery are restricted, please do not wander. If you have need for anything, speak to the Bishop in the library." 

He looks up from his book for a half second, noticing you're both foreigners. "Look for the hat." Then he returns to his reading, ignoring you entirely.

You make your way through the long hallways of the monastery with ease. Others seems to part in the path of your guide, a higher ranking clergyman's right. The place is very clean, the wood floors shine as if waxed and the wall are smooth as glass. You see quite the variety of people, though all dress as members of the clergy. Young and old, even laguz populate the people of the monastery. In some of the open doors you see open rooms with circles drawn on the ground, sitting room with shelves upon shelves of books, and others that look like classrooms.

Desii looks around the massive library in awe. The brunette wants nothing more than to claim one of the massive leather armchairs for herself and settle in with a stack of books the size of herself. Be it light magic as the topic or not, this much *knowledge* was too much to pass up. The little voice in her head reminds her that she has a purpose for being her, and she had best approach that first.

Desii had made the call that the doorman would... not be helpful, in finding Enera. She looks around for the Bishop the doorman mentioned, not spotting him on the first floor. She takes the stairs up slowly, distracted by the titles of the books she can read from the stairs. On the second floor, she's able to spot the Bishop by, indeed, his hat. She waits long enough to ensure Aldus saw where she went before approaching him.

"Good, good morning Sir Bishop." Desii says with only a slight curtsy, remembering her disastrous introduction to Elfriede yesterday. "I have a request of you, if you wouldn't mind. I was told a girl by the name of Enera could be found here, and I'd like to speak to her if she has the time." Desii says diplomatically. "I don't mind waiting!" she adds quickly.

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

The bishop looks up as soon as Desii says the name Enera. He frowns at Desii, placing his hands in front of him and sitting up in his chair. While past his prime, his broad shoulders are still a bit intimidating when he sits straight. 

"I don't know what you've heard, or what reason you think you have to visit Enera, but she does not see visitors at anyone's beck and call. I ask that you let whatever objective you have in mind go and enjoy our library, lest we are forced to remove you from the library. Lady Enera is far too busy to see anyone who comes by wanting to meet our local progidy. She is the Cardinal's private student after all; that does not come with afternoons off to talk to... whoever you are." the Bishop says, digging into Desii with a cold tone. It's almost aggressive, though it's tempered with the tired tone of someone whose been asked the same question a thousand times. He continues to glare at Desii, waiting for her to move or respond.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-27*

As he makes himself ready to go to the monastery that morning, he decides to shave his usually closely groomed facial hair completely off. After making sure his face is clean and fresh, he ties his hair in a low ponytail leaving a few of his bangs fashionably free in front of his face, in an attempt to clean himself up a bit for the sake of first impressions. Forgoing his armor again, he wears his typical casual green tunic and custom tailored pants. He pulls two final items from the depths of his pack that he hasn’t had use for as of yet - a formal waist sash in deep brown, and a matching custom tailored vest. He adorns the two more formal items and sets down to the inn’s common area to wait for Desii.

---
The monastery paints an imposing image, not one fixture on the building is left in its natural state, everything having been painted pitch black. Aldus has never seen any building like it before. The buildings in his home country are typically left in their natural state another testament to the differences of Wynne and Eraia. The inside is no less imposing, Aldus idly wonders exactly how long it would take one person to clean and polish this entire building, a task he assumes is primary left to low ranking scholars and perhaps apprentices as punishment for defying orders. Everyone moved out of the way of the man leading them quite formally, as if its its expected of them, he notes. The entire population of the monastery is clad in white, it’s quite obvious these people are indeed obsessed with cleanliness. *What if they drop something on their robes? Wouldn’t it be more economical to wear something a little darker?* he thinks critically. There is one thing however that brings him a bit of comfort to see - other laguz, although none are Naissankari, they are mostly cat laguz he notes. The realization that he hasn't seen another wolf laguz since Theanovene summons a bit of homesickness, if only for a moment. A few he passes eye him up curiously, he notes the don't asses Desii in the same way.

The library is tremendous in size, he’s quite sure there are more book here than in all of Wynne. Desiis seems to be just as impressed as he notes the glimmer in her eye, and her slack jaw. Despite her trance, she snaps out of it quickly and begins to search for her true goal.

As she does so Aldus spot a large book placed on a pedestal, atop a low stage and surrounded by many candles. Shelves of book continue behind the elevator platform and no sign forbid him from approaching. He eyes the book curiously, underneath it seats a small placard which reads ‘This time is provide to the public in common language so that all children of Aurii might come to realise the light of Lylalel’ Aldus blinks at the inscription *what does even mean?* he thinks. The name Lylalel rings a bell he can’t quite place. He begins to read the page the book is open too:

Commandments of the followers of Lylalel and all other who exist in her presence: 
1. No other image should be held higher than the image of Lylalel, Most Holy Lady of Light
2. No other so called ‘god’ should have a place in  a follower of Lylalel’s or any that exist in her chosen land of Eraia. It is heretical to speak another ‘gods’ name in her chosen land. No crime, murder included, is ranked worse than slandering or promoting another ‘god’.
3. All should part before a member of the Most Holy’s chosen attendants.
4. None but the chosen attendents of Lylalel may read her most holy of words. 
5. All faithful servants of Lylalel should make it a point to offer their last prayer to her before departing to be by her side.

Just as he is about to continue reading this impossibly list of rules and doctrine he hears Desii call out to a Bishop on the second floor, signifying she has found what she was looking for. She doesn't waste time getting straight to the point - something Aldus can admire - and asks her question outright, yet politely. 

The Bishop however does not respond with same politeness, in fact he almost seems offended but also bored. Aldus wonders idly if she broke any of those five rules he just read about. Aldus approaches the conversation cautiously coming up behind Desii and halting at her side. “Perhaps we could ask just one thing then?” He says voice unfaltering, he’ll be damned if he lets some frail old man intimidate him. “Is Lady Enera happy?” 

---

As the two companions descend the stairs a few moments later Aldus leans down closer to Desii and speaks in a tone low enough so only she can hear him “Perhaps we should speak to Princess Tyndall? Or even Sir Faun? Assuming our next meeting with him goes better then my first, I’d imagine one of them would have a better idea on how to navigate this situation then either of us would.”

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

The bishop turns to Aldus, his eyes sharp and accusatory. "Lady Enera is the Cardinal's star student. She is well carried for and enjoys her days here. That is however, also none of your concern." he says with a dry edge to his voice. He looks between Aldus and Desii once more before turning back to his work.

Desii backs down at the bishops second glare. She trails after Aldus as he turns on his heel, her hands wringing the hem of her shirt. She doesn't say anything until Aldus breaks the ice, saying "Perhaps we should speak to Princess Tyndall? Or even Sir Faun? Assuming our next meeting with him goes better then my first, I’d imagine one of them would have a better idea on how to navigate this situation then either of us would.”

Desii nods once. She didn't imagine they'd be so *defensive* when she asked to speak to Enera. What's the difference from Desii waiting in the library for Enera to happen by? She only wanted to meet Enera, not... Desii can't even imagine what kind of person a response like that is meant to keep away. She knew she didn't deserve that kind of response though!

Shaking her head to get out of the haze in her head she looks to Aldus. Half a dozen thoughts come to mind of how to circumvent the man, talking to someone else, waiting to see if they can coincidently bump into Enera, sneaking about, and more. Talking to the Princess didn't come to mind though. 

"Would she be willing to do that for us? We barely know her, even if Eliran and her and friends..." She says as the step off the staircase, back to the first floor.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-02*

Aldus resists the urge to roll his eyes at the disgruntled old man. *Is everyone in this country on such a power trip?* he thinks to himself, annoyed. 

“I-Well I’m not positive. She seems generous enough after last night, and she gave you this lead in the first place. Perhaps she knows more? I’m sure a princess’s request would go further than ours.” Aldus scratches his newly-naked chin and thinks, the smooth skin feeling awkward in his hand. “I believe she mentioned she is also a light mage. Maybe they will have lessons together?” He sighs heavily and looks at Desii pointedly. “I’m sorry we couldn't see her today, I know this means alot to you. At least we know she *is* here, now it’s just a matter of getting around bureaucracy.”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-03*

Having finished her training session, Afina had retired to her room to ready herself for the rest of the day. She re-tied her hair into a neat bow, strapped her sword to her side, and changed into her traveling clothes. The princess figured that she would spend some time walking around the market; Perhaps if she was lucky, she would bump into Elfriede. _Or unlucky,_ she thought, remembering their encounter last night. The Laeran shook her head. She had to give Elfriede time to sort out his private matters. Forcing an intimate encounter would not end well for anyone._And a liason with an Eraian would arise some suspicion should word reach Callora about Elfriede_, Afina sighed. For the first time, she was beginning to feel grateful that they had cut short their intimate encounter. _I should have considered the consequences more before rushing into it_.

Afina quickly exited her room, pulling the door shut gracefully behind her. She began to mull over the events that had occurred in the training room. At the end of it all, the bishop had seemed impressed. “Thank Archon that I didn’t let my distracts get the better of me,” she said quietly, head lowered as she walked down the hallway. Even still… Afina had always conjured spells because she _knew_ that she could. She was a Laeran, the most knowledgeable of all ethnicities, taught by a gifted Eraian, the country that pioneered light magic. Of _course_ she could do it. Even still, only a fool would ignore the connection between her detonation spell and her memories of Elfriede in peril. The princess decided she would investigate later.

The Callorian turned a corner. _Perhaps I can find Eliran and seek counse--_ “Oh!” Afina exclaimed stopping short of colliding with two individuals. “Pardon,” she said, before she realized who she had almost run into. The two that had travelled with Eliran… Afina frowned as she tried to remember their names. “Ah, traveling without Eliran? A wise move, he is _quite_ the distraction,” Afina smiled, resting her hand on the hilt of her sword passively. She suddenly realized that she was mimicking Elfriede and straightened her back, hands shifting to rest at her sides. “Princess Afina Tyndall of Laera in the kingdom of Callora. Might I ask what you both are up to?”

Desii looks up to Aldus, the Naissankari apologizing to her for not being able to help. 

"It's not like it's your fault AldU-"  Desii says before stumbling to stop short of running into another woman rounding the corner. She pulls on Aldus's shirt to keep from toppling into the other person, hastily righting herself and sending a sheepish look to Aldus.

"Oh my, Princess Tyndall!" Desii half exclaims, half whispers as she realizes who she almost headbutted. "Apologies, and a pleasure to see you again." Desii says with a short curtsey. "I suppose... we were looking for you?" she adds with a light smile.
